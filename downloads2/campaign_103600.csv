<p><b>What makes us unique?</b></p>
<p>Let's face it, there is a need for good Role Models in the gaming community. Instead of using sex or foul language to be funny, we are a channel built on clean humor to entertain our youth audience. We are providing a place where people of all ages can go, where they can sit back and enjoy their time while being a part of a constructive social experience. Our channel offers a place where kids can come interact with others, make friends, while learning how to carry a conversation with respect, rather than trash talk. Most of youtube is not live, the audience just watches a pre-made video. On our channel we are playing live in front of an audience and talking back and forth with them. This is much more engaging.</p>
<p><b>What will the money go towards?</b></p>
<p><b>$6,000-</b> This is the bare minimum we need to properly upgrade our equipment. We need 2 new high end desktops that can be used as gaming pc's while they stream the video and commentary to YouTube. This money will also buy new mics and facecams</p>
<p><b>$20,000-</b> This target would allow Travis and Jim to drop their full time jobs to do YouTube full time. The money would go towards a studio together with a business internet connection</p>
<p><b>$40,000-$200,000-</b> This target would give us the money to buy google advertising. At 75 cents per subscriber, this would put us up over the 100 thousand subscriber mark which is considered a legitimate milestone for any YouTuber. </p>
</div><p></p><h3>Risks and challenges</h3><p>The challenge of being a YouTuber is consistency. We are very talented, but having to work full time jobs other than YouTube to put food on the table, has made it impossible to do our livestreams during the prime hours of the day. If we could stream every day at the same time, we would have grown so much more than we have this far. Once we get to a certain point where YouTube can pay our living expenses, we will be able to do it on a scheduled basis and really take off.</p><br/></div>","What makes us unique?

<br/>Risks &amp; Challenges <p> </p>
<p>We pride ourselves on offering the highest quality products made to our highest standards and expectations. We have worked extremely hard to ready this product for Indiegogo OnDemand and full-scale manufacturing and fulfillment, but here are what I see as the risks:</p>
<p>MANUFACTURING: Creating the tooling to manufacture a product of this size is expensive and requires expert knowledge to get it right. There is typically a 40-60 day lead time to create the molds for a product of this size and this is where delays could occur. To minimize that possibility we're working with tooling manufacturing partners with a track record for prompt quality.</p>
<p>PRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: As BEANBAGGLZ™ gets geared up for production, there will likely be some minor adjustments to improve the final product. Pre-production prototypes are made to test and refine the product and allow us to incorporate our adjustments and those suggested by experienced manufacturing partners. These will always be for the benefit of you, the consumer, and we will let you know exactly how and why any are made.</p>
<p>FULFILLMENT: Sometimes things go awry that can’t be planned for: a supplier misses a deadline, a machine breaks down, or a shipment gets lost. Those things could cause a delay. To minimize the possibility of manufacturing setbacks we will enter the manufacturing stage with at least one back-up supplier for each component pre-located and our product commercialization experts will help ensure smooth sailing from our suppliers and factories.</p>
<p>We will be working with manufacturers who have years of experience delivering excellent products in tremendous quantities. There will no doubt be some surprises along the road, but any obstacle will be addressed by combining our internal knowledge with external expertise, and an overall goal of making the best possible product for you, our BEANBAGGLZ™ Community.</p>
<p>We are humbled by your interest and say THANK YOU for your help!</p>

ODiN Aurora presents you a whole new experience with computer and mouse. The world's first laser projection mouse redefines your daily user habits for designing, gaming, work, and everything. Light and easy to carry, ODiN Aurora is your must-have gadget for computers and laptops. It’s all designed just for you.


Honorably, ODiN won ""Compuex d&i award"" and "" BC award"" in 2015 and has drawn attention of major media across the globe.


  
                                                    

According to an old Norse poem, ODiN the major diety is the originator of the runes. On that note, we believe ODiN is an innovative product that challenges people’s perception of electro-optical applications, and opens up a whole new world of endless possibilities.


The triangle runic symbol is now your self-defined button.

Inspired by Nordic mythology, ODiN Aurora embodies the powerful figure. Laser beams are projected as lightning when the legendary Odin throws his spear. A triangle, innovative and extraordinary in Runic alphabets, is also incorporated in the virtual pad design, projecting strength and courage into our life.



Does your arm or wrist feel tired or even hurt after holding the traditional mouse for a long time? No more pain! The problem is solved with ODiN Aurora. As your wrist comfortably rests on the table or other surfaces, your shoulder and arm muscles can take a break, so you can focus on work, game, or both, or anything!




ODiN Aurora supports multipoint controls. In the 8cm x 8cm project area, you only need, at most, three fingers to click, scroll, drag and zoom, as easy as that! With low CPU loading and responsive design, it enables smoother net-surfing and gaming experiences, wherever you go.   




 The gestures of ODiN in use
 Different scenarios when ODiN in use



 ODiN's New Function: Three finger Gesture/ODiN's first game: ODiN jump







You will see different options here. 





Let's start to play!






ODiN's New Feature
ODiN’s new feature, a user-defined application “button,” is here! The triangle runic symbol is now a “button” for you to define, in both Windows and Mac. Be it open a particular software or “back to the desktop”, the button is at your disposal. For the laser button, you can code your own macro and even share it on Serafim’s online forum! 
 ODiN key: users' guide (Both Mac & Windows)

Go to Serafim's website and click ""Software Download"" in ""Support"".
http://www.serafim-tech.com/odin/software-download.htm
1.     Website: 
Paste a  website, set the awaiting time and click ""add"". Click ODiN key and the webpage will show.
2. Application: 
Click the blank, choose an application and set the time. Add it and click ODiN key.
3. Hot Key:
Enter a shortcut, set the time, and click ""add"". Click ODiN key to let the magic happen! 







Tiny and portable, ODiN Aurora only weighs 40 grams, fits well in your pocket or backpack, and consumes very littler power! This is the best travel companion for business travelers and your office on the go. It's compatible with Windows XP and later, as well as Mac OS. We will also continue to update software, so ODiN Aurora never goes outdated. Plug in to USB hub, and you're ready to enjoy!





Privacy has been a concern for some people as they use gesture controllers, such as virtual keyboards, as cameras are integrated in the operation. Well, no worries with ODiN Aurora! With no camera involved, your privacy is ensured. It's good for confidential meetings of course, with doubled response speeds, minimized sensing modules, and smaller package.





Although ODiN Aurora is our debut project under Serafim, our development and design team has already got extensive experiences in optoelectronics industry over ten years, working and taking orders from manufacturers all over the world. We aim to offer affordable, useful and cool devices for your better computing experience, and ODiN Aurora is the result after one year in development.


 
ODiN Aurora comes in three colors: metal green, bright silver, and charcoal black. We maintain the best coloring process, so what you see is what you get!

</div></div>","SteamDolls is a steampunk inspired metroidvania game with a grimy touch of brutality. 
You are The Whisper - voiced by David Hayter (The Legendary Solid Snake).
Blast your way to your objective or stick to the shadows and perform violent assassinations on unsuspecting guards, as you struggle with the haunting apparitions of a mesmerizing witch trying to reveal the truth about a conspiracy that could shake the very foundation of the world.
ACTION, EXPLORATION, STEALTH, AND BLOOD.
Inspired by games like Castlevania and Hollow knight. Nourished by the fury of Dead Cells and the gloom of Bloodborne. A touch of societal decay from Dishonored. Lose yourself in a labyrinthine city, full of secrets and madness.

Interactive Map

 Hand-drawn Cutscenes for the narrative parts.
 Huge abominations will try to take you down.


Example of an infected and demented Boss
“When fossil fuels were depleted, it was time for a change. But it never came. The discovery of a new superconductive material made sure the cycle never broke.”
This is the way their world ends, not with a bang - but a Whisper.
 

You will have access to many upgradable skills during the course of the game to help you fulfill your mission. Choose to be a swift and silent assassin or a slow yet powerful damage dealer. It's all up to you.

Society crumbled over time, falling into a state of disarray. Innovation became stagnation. Progression to regression. Not future, nor past. An industrial era haunted by the ghost of what came before. Mankind, their mentality ever worsening as idle habits fed into the City. Unified and tortuous, it swallowed what remained of their humanity. Stealing away their free will, their determination. Crushing their souls until nothing remained. Madness.
Desperate for an alternative way to regain the glory of Old, scientists searched for a remedy.
Until they found something. Something that should have been left alone.
Mindless citizens, the needed catalyst. Transforming them. Adapting their flesh. Mere dolls. Cruel monsters.


In Steamdolls, you assume the role of a cunning thief and anarchist  known as ""The Whisper"" and make your way through heavily secured  environments. (Dubbed by Mr. David Hayter).

 

Here is the flamboyant cast you will encounter during the game. 
A goddess of Nature.
A rich immortal who wants to die (voiced by Mr. Christopher ""Otacon"" Randolph )
A female gunslinger with deadly aim.
A determined Inquisitor with a plan (voiced by Mrs. Jennifer Hale )

</p>
<h3>Hello</h3>
<p>I am Santiago Zapata, the developer of Ananias, a classic Roguelike
	game designed to be played comfortably in touch screen devices such as
	smartphones and tablets, as well as easily accessible through any
	modern browser.</p>
<p>
	You can play the current demo of the game online <a href=""http://ananiasgame.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>, or download it for
	your <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.slashland.ananias"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Android
		device</a>. It's free!
</p>
<p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://slashwareint.com/ananias/igg/148sample.png"" src="""" style=""width: 100%;""/>
</p>
<p>We are a four persons team working to create an awesome classic roguelike experience on modern devices. Using funds from you, the community, we were able to create this demo, but to finish the game we need your help.</p>
<p>We want to provide a genuine roguelike experience; not a roguelite, but a game that stays close to the foundations of the roguelike genre, except the accessibility barrier that prevents so many people from enjoying them</p>
<p>So far we have been able to deploy our demo to Google Play Store, where it's been installed by about 24.000 users; we want to finish its development, delivering a complete product.</p>
<h3>What does this game play like?</h3>
<p>Gameplay is designed to be simple and fun; your goal is to
	survive about 25 levels, and fetch an ancient artifact located at the
	end.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the game you can pick a monster pet to join you in your adventure, each one of them has different abilities and can evolve into powerful creatures using magic spells found into the dungeon.</p>
<p>There are 4 classes, each one with its own strengths and weaknesses:</p>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://slashwareint.com/ananias/igg/alchemist.png"" src="""" style=""""/>
</p>
<h4>Alchemist</h4>
<p>Shoots liquid at enemies (Acid, Liquid Fire, and other potions)</p>
<p>Can mix reagents into potions without danger of explosion.</p>
<p>Starts with powerful potions (Flame Potion for example which
	deals a lot of fire damage when thrown)</p>
<p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://slashwareint.com/ananias/igg/arcane.png"" src="""" style=""""/>
</p>
<h4>Arcane</h4>
<p>Can cast the most powerful spells without danger of backfiring</p>
<p>Extends power of magic wands</p>
<p>Starts with powerful spells (like Charm Monster which makes any
	creature become your ally)</p>
<p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://slashwareint.com/ananias/igg/paladin.png"" src="""" style=""""/>
</p>
<h4>Paladin</h4>
<p>Can use all weapons and armor</p>
<p>Blocks attacks using his shield</p>
<p>Extends lifetime of weapons</p>
<p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://slashwareint.com/ananias/igg/hunter.png"" src="""" style=""""/>
</p>
<h4>Hunter</h4>
<p>Never misses a shot with a bow</p>
<p>Performs critical damage with bows</p>
<p>Prevents arrows from breaking</p>
</div>
<h3>The Dungeon</h3>
<p>The levels in the dungeon are randomly generated every time you
	play, so you have to explore the level gathering useful equipment and
	looking the stairs to the next level, while avoiding death and managing
	your limited resources.</p>
<ul>
<li>...will you drop your spare weapon and carry this potion with
		you, knowing it could be useful on the next level?</li>
<li>...will you risk attacking a group of enemies to fetch that
		powerful armor that could save your life? or will you better run away
		to save your hitpoints</li>
<li>...will you withstand the enemy attacks to reach the backrow
		and kill the phantom who is constantly healing all others?</li>
<li>...will you carry with you that powerful weapon to use it
		against strong enemies two levels below, even if that means using up
		inventory space and attacking with a weaker weapon?</li>
</ul>
<p>The odds are against you, but if you die there's always a chance
	to start again and wish for better fortune</p>
<h3>What makes this game different from other roguelikes?</h3>
<p>Ananias is designed from the ground up with the idea of a
	straightforward user experience for a touch screen device; interactions
	are optimized so you don't have to waste time with cumbersome movement,
	while still allowing you to explore the dungeon and fight the dwellers
	of the dungeon.</p>
<p>A simple gameplay is also a strong design focus; the game is

</p></div>","Hello
I am Santiago Zapata, the developer of Ananias, a classic Roguelike
	game designed to be played comfortably in touch screen devices such as
	smartphones and tablets, as well as easily accessible through any
	modern browser.

	You can play the current demo of the game online here, or download it for
	your Android
		device. It's free!




We are a four persons team working to create an awesome classic roguelike experience on modern devices. Using funds from you, the community, we were able to create this demo, but to finish the game we need your help.
We want to provide a genuine roguelike experience; not a roguelite, but a game that stays close to the foundations of the roguelike genre, except the accessibility barrier that prevents so many people from enjoying them
So far we have been able to deploy our demo to Google Play Store, where it's been installed by about 24.000 users; we want to finish its development, delivering a complete product.
What does this game play like?
Gameplay is designed to be simple and fun; your goal is to
	survive about 25 levels, and fetch an ancient artifact located at the
	end.
At the beginning of the game you can pick a monster pet to join you in your adventure, each one of them has different abilities and can evolve into powerful creatures using magic spells found into the dungeon.
There are 4 classes, each one with its own strengths and weaknesses:




Alchemist
Shoots liquid at enemies (Acid, Liquid Fire, and other potions)
Can mix reagents into potions without danger of explosion.
Starts with powerful potions (Flame Potion for example which
	deals a lot of fire damage when thrown)



Arcane
Can cast the most powerful spells without danger of backfiring
Extends power of magic wands
Starts with powerful spells (like Charm Monster which makes any
	creature become your ally)



Paladin
Can use all weapons and armor
Blocks attacks using his shield
Extends lifetime of weapons



Hunter
Never misses a shot with a bow
Performs critical damage with bows
Prevents arrows from breaking

The Dungeon
The levels in the dungeon are randomly generated every time you
	play, so you have to explore the level gathering useful equipment and
	looking the stairs to the next level, while avoiding death and managing
	your limited resources.

...will you drop your spare weapon and carry this potion with
		you, knowing it could be useful on the next level?
...will you risk attacking a group of enemies to fetch that
		powerful armor that could save your life? or will you better run away
		to save your hitpoints
...will you withstand the enemy attacks to reach the backrow
		and kill the phantom who is constantly healing all others?
...will you carry with you that powerful weapon to use it
		against strong enemies two levels below, even if that means using up
		inventory space and attacking with a weaker weapon?

The odds are against you, but if you die there's always a chance
	to start again and wish for better fortune
What makes this game different from other roguelikes?
Ananias is designed from the ground up with the idea of a
	straightforward user experience for a touch screen device; interactions
	are optimized so you don't have to waste time with cumbersome movement,
	while still allowing you to explore the dungeon and fight the dwellers
	of the dungeon.
A simple gameplay is also a strong design focus; the game is
	designed for you to be able to do quick playthroughs, trying to delve
	deeper into the dungeon every time.
There are 41 enemy types, each with an unique feature that makes
	him stand apart from the rest. We are favoring uniqueness versus
	quantity in the monster design. Let me show you some of them!





Satyr: This mystical race inhabits the temple
				ruins, they move quickly so keep an eye on them!




Necromancer: These sorcerors meddle with the
				realms of the dead, they can summon undead servant to do their
				command




Fencer: Masters of the swords, they are able to
				easily disarm their enemies leaving them at their mercy




Demonspawn:This dark demonical race is able to warp
				next to their enemy giving them no chance to escape their doom



The game is being developed using the phaser.io library, one of
	quickest growing frameworks for HTML5 mobile development; it has great
	integration with CocoonJS, which in turn is capable of generating
	native packages for a lot of platforms.

</div><p><strong>Welcome to the latest Egyptian Miniatures Indiegogo Campaign!  I was inspired
by combination of archaeology, history and Hollywood films to create
a range of pseudo-historical Egyptian figures for use in role-playing
games, wargaming and collecting.  Two
years ago I launched my first Indiegogo campaign with a single set of three
miniatures.  From this humble beginning
the Egyptian range has expanded to over 140 figures.  In previous campaigns the main focus was
on the royal court and harem of pharaoh but this time we have also
included a number of sets which are characters and creatures
drawn from Egyptian mythology, and Hollywood inspired fantasy adventure
and horror films.  This will enable you to take your adventures beyond the
confines of the palace and into the desert and long forgotten tombs
of once great pharaohs.</strong></p><div>
<strong>
</strong>
</div><p><strong>A total of 21 core sets of Egyptian miniatures are being offered as perk selections
which are a good mix of personalities, warriors, adventurers, beasts and creatures.  I have been fortunate enough to
enlist the services of a really talented group of sculptors: David Soderquist,
Tim Prow, Andy Pieper, Brother Vinni and Micah Nichols, who have
sculpted some truly amazing miniatures - full of character and
originality.  I really hope you all can
join in and support the campaign.  These high-quality 28mm
miniatures are made from a lead-free pewter alloy and
have an incredible amount of detail and personality. Whether you are a
collector or gamer you are certain to enjoy these figures!  <i>Check

join in and support the campaign.  These high-quality 28mm
miniatures are made from a lead-free pewter alloy and
have an incredible amount of detail and personality. Whether you are a

The Egyptian
Miniatures IV campaign was successfully funded on 14 December 2014.  Due to the campaign’s popularity we decided
reactivate it through Indiegogo's InDemand program.  This will allow you
to get hold of some fantastic miniatures at a great price and will enable us to
continue to raise funds using the Indiegogo platform to help pay for additional
production moulds and perhaps commission some more miniatures.
There are a variety of perks to suit every
budget, which range in price from $20 to $330.  Each perk allows you to choose from the 21
sets of miniatures on offer to tailor your order to your own gaming needs.  There are also two special perk deals (The
Egyptian Undead and the Egyptian Female Guards) which consist of 8 specific set
of miniatures for the bargain price of only $85.  The sets which comprise the two deals can’t
be substituted.  A number of non-standard priced sets are available as
add-ons to your perk, as well as sets which were released during previous
Indiegogo campaigns for a flat rate of $12 (unless priced otherwise).

At this stage in the
     game this is very much a no-frills operation and everyone will
     receive their sets of miniatures in small zip-lock bags with plastic slotta
     bases.  (Sorry - no blister packs yet!).



Postage world-wide is
     included as part of the perk, and will be sent standard airmail or regular
     post.  Please note that standard
     airmail is not insured, tracked or signed for.  IF YOU REQUIRE SIGNED, RECORDED OR
     SPECIAL DELIVERY THAT WILL BE AT YOUR OWN COST.  Please contact me regarding rates.


When can I expect to get my miniatures?  There is no set deadline to the InDemand program so
perks that are purchased should be sent out as soon as the miniatures are available.  At present all of the miniatures, except the Evil
Concubines set, have been moulded and cast so you should get your miniatures
within a few weeks, if not sooner.  I expect to have the Evil Concubines
cast by the middle of June.  If there are
any delays I will be sure to let you know exactly what is going on and how long
it might take.

Here are some things to do in this section:  I'm Devin Sikiric, and I'm working in collaboration with my two closest friends. This campaign is all about bringing the dubstep guns to life and actually making them available for public use. If you help us achieve our goal, you will be creating history as this will definitley change the way parties are started. Not just that, there are so many things you can do with this that is just plain AWESOME!!!  You cant get these anywhere else in the world, and if you did, they would be small tiny dubstep guns with only one song and low volume. I have one of these and its just annoying.



   What We Need & What You Get Here is the breakdown:  We need to raise $30,000 in order to make all the molds/hardware/programming/ finding the perfect parts and creating the first 300 dubstep guns!!!

<p>The premise and rules are simple: there are four cards; <strong>Holiday Cards, Birthday Cards, Steal Cards,</strong> and <strong>Drink Cards.</strong></p>
<p>Each <strong>Holiday</strong> card has a unique effect or action- for example; For Valentine's Day, player's must go around asking each other ""out."" If the other player says yes, you are both safe and off the market. Any player denied must drink alone (just like the real Valentines Day). </p>
<p>For the Election Day card, you nominate two players and the group votes on who will be the next President (thus making a new rule). The player with the least votes drinks.</p>
<p>There are mini games for Groundhogs Day (Bill F'n Murray), Columbus Day (""Discover"" someone else's drink), Mardi Gras (Strip or Drink) and so on and so on.</p>
<p>The <strong>Birthday</strong> cards are wild cards which let you emulate the effect of any Holiday card currently played on the table.</p>
<p>The <strong>Steal </strong>cards allow you to take one of the played Holiday cards for yourself or blindly take one from another player's hand.</p>
<p>The <strong>Drink </strong>cards are used to make someone drink, but can also be used to defend against a drink assigned to you.</p>
<p>I have always loved games, and have made over a dozen or so in my adulthood but this is the first where I actually made a full custom deck. I brought to a few parties on a whim and found huge success- I had people offering to buy it off me on the spot. Hopefully that drunken enthusiasm shows itself here (hey, aren't you thirsty?).</p>
<p>The money I'm raising will be spent four ways:</p>
<p>1- Hiring a professional artist to design all the cards ($300-500)</p>
<p>2- Printing the decks in bulk to save on costs ($400-500)</p>
<p>3- Shipping ($100-200)</p>

<h3><b>Crowdfunding</b></h3>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>
<b></b><p><b>What happens to my money in the case that you have not reached your goal by the end of your campaign?</b></p>
<p>We have already started making these products, so the moment you purchase a perk, you can be certain we will deliver you a product regardless if we reach our goal or not.  We chose ""flexibile"" funding on Indiegogo which means this is not an ""all or nothing"" campaign.  </p>
<b>Why are we on a crowdfunding platform?</b>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Some people have been wondering why we chose to Crowdfund our new venture... Firstly, crowdfunding is very powerful because it allows us to have a close, connected relationship with our customers and community. Something that is often hard if you only go the traditional route which is through big distributors/retailers... It also allows us to charge lower prices, if we can establish this relationship direct to our consumers.</p>
<p>Finally, we're a small company... less than 40 staff, crowdfunding is an opportunity to stay nimble and small, and ultimately allow us to listen to what our community wants more... without having to raise big sums of money from VC’s, we can grow organically with our community.</p>

<br/>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">How do I choose a specific size mouse pad or keyboard?<br/></b>We will contact you with a follow-up email at the end of the campaign asking for your preference of product options and then once you choose we will ship it out.  If we do not hear a response, we will reach out again, after two weeks, we will send you our most popular version of that product.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Wait... How did Fnatic learn how to make hardware?</b></p> <p>We started by getting our hands on virtually every other brand's product we could.  We particularly loved a lot of things about one company's products. Func Inc was a peripheral manufacture in Sweden.  While we loved the design language and build quality of Func's old products, we didn't feel any of products were quite right for Esports aside from their KB-460 Keyboard.  We were truly impressed with the design and attention to detail we saw from the guys at Func and knew we wanted to work with them.  A few talks, and months later, we officially added Func Inc's team, based out in Sweden, to Fnatic to create Fnatic Gear.  </p>
<p><br/><b>What did the process of product development look like?</b></p>
<p>We decided to scrap the rest of Func's product designs and start developing everything else from scratch.<br/><br/>We spent months with our players giving feedback on what they wanted in Esports gear.  It was an long long long long long process.  We spent a ton of time in Asia, evaluating factory partners, working with them to build initial prototypes, testing materials, and countless hours testing and validating our products designs.  <br/><br/>Only now, we truly feel we are ready to bring forth the FLICK, RUSH, FOCUS, and BOOST to the community.<br/></p> <p><b>Are the products plug &amp; play? Does the FLICK Optical Mouse or RUSH Mechanical Keyboard come with any software?</b></p>
<p>Yes. While all of our products are plug and play, they come with basic software to change profile settings, LED colors, and macro settings.</p>
<p><b>Do the products work on both PC &amp; MAC.</b></p> <p>Yes, the products work plug and play with both PC and MAC. However, our current software does not support MAC systems. This means currently, MAC users will have limited capability to change settings on the mouse and keyboard. We will be further developing our software to better support MAC users in the near future.</p> <p><b>What languages does the RUSH Keyboard come in?</b></p> <p>The Fnatic Gear RUSH keyboard is available in US, UK, NORDIC, GERMAN, and FRENCH layouts.</p>
<b>Will you be making a left handed mouse?</b><br/><br/>
<p>This is our initial line-up of products which we’ve kept small and focused, but our plan is to make many more!  We’re already in R&amp;D with a few more products, but, unfortunately, a left-handed mouse isn’t one them. We’ll be gauging the community interest during the campaign and  after, and look to prioritise new products based off of that.</p>
<br/>
<h3 style=""color: #ffa34b;"">Shipping</h3> <p><b>When will my Fnatic Gear products ship?</b></p> <p>Fnatic Gear will begin shipping products in December 2015 at the end of our campaign, on a first-ordered, first-received basis. Our team will keep you notified of your Fnatic Gear ship date.</p> <p><b></b></p>
<p><b>Where does Fnatic Gear ship from?</b></p>
<p>All products will be shipped from the UK.</p>
<p><b>Where does Fnatic Gear ship to?</b></p> <p>We currently ship to the US, Canada, EU (all 28 countries), Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, and the rest of the world.</p> <br/>
<h3 style=""color: #ffa34b;"">Warranty</h3> <p><b>What is the warranty?</b></p> <p>We provide a 2 year warranty against manufacturer's defects. Free repairs and component replacements will be provided under warranty period for manufacturer's defect. If not in accordance with the instructions of use, human factors, product surface damage, bumps or scratches will not be covered under this warranty.</p> <br/>

We have already started making these products, so the moment you purchase a perk, you can be certain we will deliver you a product regardless if we reach our goal or not.  We chose ""flexibile"" funding on Indiegogo which means this is not an ""all or nothing"" campaign.  
Why are we on a crowdfunding platform?


Some people have been wondering why we chose to Crowdfund our new venture... Firstly, crowdfunding is very powerful because it allows us to have a close, connected relationship with our customers and community. Something that is often hard if you only go the traditional route which is through big distributors/retailers... It also allows us to charge lower prices, if we can establish this relationship direct to our consumers.
Finally, we're a small company... less than 40 staff, crowdfunding is an opportunity to stay nimble and small, and ultimately allow us to listen to what our community wants more... without having to raise big sums of money from VC’s, we can grow organically with our community.

Products SPECIFICATIONS






How do I choose a specific size mouse pad or keyboard?We will contact you with a follow-up email at the end of the campaign asking for your preference of product options and then once you choose we will ship it out.  If we do not hear a response, we will reach out again, after two weeks, we will send you our most popular version of that product.

Wait... How did Fnatic learn how to make hardware? We started by getting our hands on virtually every other brand's product we could.  We particularly loved a lot of things about one company's products. Func Inc was a peripheral manufacture in Sweden.  While we loved the design language and build quality of Func's old products, we didn't feel any of products were quite right for Esports aside from their KB-460 Keyboard.  We were truly impressed with the design and attention to detail we saw from the guys at Func and knew we wanted to work with them.  A few talks, and months later, we officially added Func Inc's team, based out in Sweden, to Fnatic to create Fnatic Gear.  
What did the process of product development look like?
We decided to scrap the rest of Func's product designs and start developing everything else from scratch.We spent months with our players giving feedback on what they wanted in Esports gear.  It was an long long long long long process.  We spent a ton of time in Asia, evaluating factory partners, working with them to build initial prototypes, testing materials, and countless hours testing and validating our products designs.  Only now, we truly feel we are ready to bring forth the FLICK, RUSH, FOCUS, and BOOST to the community. Are the products plug & play? Does the FLICK Optical Mouse or RUSH Mechanical Keyboard come with any software?
Yes. While all of our products are plug and play, they come with basic software to change profile settings, LED colors, and macro settings.
Do the products work on both PC & MAC. Yes, the products work plug and play with both PC and MAC. However, our current software does not support MAC systems. This means currently, MAC users will have limited capability to change settings on the mouse and keyboard. We will be further developing our software to better support MAC users in the near future. What languages does the RUSH Keyboard come in? The Fnatic Gear RUSH keyboard is available in US, UK, NORDIC, GERMAN, and FRENCH layouts.
Will you be making a left handed mouse?
This is our initial line-up of products which we’ve kept small and focused, but our plan is to make many more!  We’re already in R&D with a few more products, but, unfortunately, a left-handed mouse isn’t one them. We’ll be gauging the community interest during the campaign and  after, and look to prioritise new products based off of that.

Shipping When will my Fnatic Gear products ship? Fnatic Gear will begin shipping products in December 2015 at the end of our campaign, on a first-ordered, first-received basis. Our team will keep you notified of your Fnatic Gear ship date. 
Where does Fnatic Gear ship from?
All products will be shipped from the UK.
Where does Fnatic Gear ship to? We currently ship to the US, Canada, EU (all 28 countries), Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Singapore, Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, and the rest of the world. 
Warranty What is the warranty? We provide a 2 year warranty against manufacturer's defects. Free repairs and component replacements will be provided under warranty period for manufacturer's defect. If not in accordance with the instructions of use, human factors, product surface damage, bumps or scratches will not be covered under this warranty.

<h3>A Classic Gaming Arcade of Epic Proportions</h3>
<p>Build it and they will come. That's what they say. We want to build an arcade in the UK. An Epic Arcade. Like the ones still thriving in Japan to this day. We'll have classic games. New games. Pinball machines. Consoles. Free-play events. Tournaments. Cocktail cabinets. Gaming booths. Streamed gaming marathons. World Record High Score events. Homebrew/indie gaming events. Cabinet building workshops. Cabinet hire. And everything else in-between. Oh, and did we mention that we plan to have over 200 playable machines at any given time, with an additional stock of Jamma boards so we can rotate through our game offerings on a regular basis. Epic.</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>We don't just want to setup a videogame arcade. We want to create a legacy. A legacy to everything that was great about arcades back in the 80's and 90's. Growing up in Blackpool (England, UK) I was constantly exposed to the latest and greatest arcade game sensations as soon as they hit the streets. Blackpool was a mecca for gamers - rows of arcades along the seafront offering everything a young gamer could ask for. But it was more than that, more than playing the new games before any else. It was the buzz. The thrill. The excitement of setting a new highscore and proudly putting your initials on top of the leaderboard whilst a group of people stood behind you in silent awe. And that's what we want to recreate. The adrenalin rush. Social interaction. Meeting new friends (real ones, not faceless people you spend hours chatting to online!). The buzz of setting a new record or beating a new-found-friend on your favourite fighting game.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Where?</h3>
<p>Being based in Scotland there's only one practical place to open this arcade and that is the country's capital, Edinburgh. Why Edinburgh? We want to attract gamers from all around the world, not just people living locally. Edinburgh is a thriving tourist destination and we want to maximise that exposure so that as many people as possible can enjoy what we plan to create.</p>
<p>Funding permitting, we plan to secure a 3-storey building within the bounds of the city centre of Edinburgh. We have huge plans for our vision, and you can follow progress on our project website at <a href=""http://www.epicarcadeproject.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.epicarcadeproject.com</a> where we will keep you updated as things develop, including sourcing machines, architect drawings, artist impressions, and so forth. You can even enter polls to suggest games, and there will be a final, all-important competition to have the honour of naming our arcade from a narrowed-down list of suggestions.</p>
<h3>Will the Games Cost Me to Play?</h3>
<p>A set fee to get in, then it's all free-play central from there on in. That's 200+ cabinets, pinball galore, loads of consoles and games, and plenty of other goodies to satisfy your gaming needs. Arcade will be open for a minimum of 12 hours every single day. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>East Meets West</h3>
<p>Whilst there will be a large focus on classic videogames, we also want to recreate the buzz and excitement that is still thriving in the arcades in Japan. Multi-storey arcade-plexes, bursting at the seams with machines and gamers hanging out, socialising, and having fun. So we're going to have a nice mix of some of the newer games on the market, ranging from classic shooters from developer Cave, to some of the more obscure Japanese-only machines out there.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why Should I Get Excited About This Project and Donate to it?</h3>
<p>Good question. Here is just a taster of what we'll have available in our arcade:</p>
<ul>
<li>Over 200 playable arcade machines</li>
<li>A dozen pinball machines</li>
<li>Gaming memoribilia</li>
<li>Aracde machines hooked up to giant screens around the arcade</li>
<li>Consoles to play in our comfy couch area</li>
<li>Booths available for you and your mates to game together on a cocktail cabinet</li>
<li>Highscore leaderboards for both the arcade highscores and world record holders</li>
<li>Gaming marathon sessions which will be streamed live on the internet</li>
<li>World record attempts</li>
<li>Competitions</li>
<li>Homwbrew/indie gaming events</li>
<li>Swap shops</li>
<li>Machine hire</li>
<li>Room hire for events</li>
<li>Talks from game designers and developers, lectures, workshops, gaming documentary viewings, game-influenced DJ sets</li>
<li>Late night sessions</li>
<li>Merchandise</li>
<li>A fully immersive VR machine (Lawnmower man anyone?) - assuming we can track one down which is proving mighty difficult!</li>
<li>Influence other gaming projects, such as our ambition to build a 48-player networkable version of the classic game Bomberman, or a 4-player remake of Smash TV - to name but a few</li>
<li>Be part of something special, to tell people you helped make this happen, that you were there from the beginning</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>To reignite the passion of the arcades of yesteryear. To prove to the world that arcades are the home of videogames, not fruit machines. To be the industry leader in a new wave of videogame arcades across the globe, and encourage similar projects around the world.</p>
<h3>How Will My Donation Be Spent?</h3>
<p>If we reach our target then we'll be able to do all of the above, and much more. You might not think that it could cost almost $500,000 to setup an arcade, but when you factor in the cost of securing over 200 authentic machines, a dozen pinball machines, architect and legal fees, insurance, rent, rates (electricity costs won't be cheap!), refurbishing a 3-floor building to our specifications, an additional stock of Jamma boards, parts, etc. then the costs soon add up. Not to mention staffing costs! Of course, we want this to be a successful business venture that makes money so that it can continue to operate, however having this funding in place will be paramount in covering costs whilst the arcade is in its infancy. Keeping true to its roots as a videogame arcade is our primary focus, so not having to initially worry about where the next rent payment is coming from will allow us to focus our energy on the important stuff.</p>
<p>However, and there's always a however - should we only reach partial funding then we will scale the project accordingly. Smaller premises, less cabinets, less of the expensive machines. Not ideal, but sill focusing on the main goal. Our website <a href=""http://www.epicarcadeproject.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.epicarcadeproject.com</a> will detail progress and keep all enthusiasts informed of the scheduled opening.</p>
<h3>What If You Exceed Your Initial Funding Proposal?</h3>
<p>We have thought about this over and over, and we came to the conclusion that this funding campaign will go in one of these two ways - either people just won't get it and we'll raise $1000, or it'll become a huge success and we'll raise close to a million :-)</p>
<p>If we hit a funding target of a million dollars we will be able to have the arcade on free-play for a full year without any entry fees (possibly longer depending on the final total raised), allowing as many people as possible to enjoy the arcade completely free of charge. You will be able to make a small onsite donation if you choose. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Love the idea, want to help out, but not in a position to make a financial donation. No problem. There's a host of ways you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word - tell your friends, family, the world about Epic Arcade Project . Use your facebook account, twitter, blog, whatever you have at your disposal.</li>

<li>Visit <a href=""http://www.epicarcadeproject.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.epicarcadeproject.com</a> and contribute in the shaping of the arcade via our forum - recommend cabinets, consoles, events, tournaments, even a name!</li>
<li>Buy merchandise for christmas presents, birthday presents, or a just-for-the-hell-of-it present</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>Parting Words ...</h3>
<p>If we don't make this happen we feel the videogame arcades will wither away and die. Our children and new-generation gamers won't have been given the opportunity to feel the buzz, the rush, the excitement of a real, physical gamers paradise. Keep our dream alive. For nostalgias sake.</p></div>","A Classic Gaming Arcade of Epic Proportions

<p>Ye Olde Commons is a site dedicated to supporting the hobbies of larping, battle games, reenactment, interactive theater, and similar recreational activities.  Since our foundation in 2004, we have worked to enhance the facilities to support these hobbies, including changing the appearance to evoke an appropriate setting.</p>
<p>One wish that has been raised by many attendees of games at the site is a fireplace in the tavern.  We would like to make this a reality, which will require some significant construction to replace a large section of wall with a chimney that must reach above the peak of the dining hall to meet building code.</p>
<p>We have performed the initial investigation, discussed the plans with the building inspector, and received several contractor quotes.  This indiegogo project goal is set at 50% of the estimated total cost.  We are excited to move ahead, and will use these project funds to initiate the work this fall.  If we exceed the project goal, we will be able to increase the size of the hearth inside, and use natural stone rather than bricks, which will enhance the appearance greatly.</p>

We have performed the initial investigation, discussed the plans with the building inspector, and received several contractor quotes.  This indiegogo project goal is set at 50% of the estimated total cost.  We are excited to move ahead, and will use these project funds to initiate the work this fall.  If we exceed the project goal, we will be able to increase the size of the hearth inside, and use natural stone rather than bricks, which will enhance the appearance greatly.

<h2><strong><span lang=""EN-US"">Why crowdfunding?</span></strong></h2>
<p align=""justify""><span lang=""EN-US"">Not so long ago, Meiko Miniatures released the Lizardmen Big Guy, the Hemlocked Skink Assassin Star Player nº 1 and the four Lizardmen Girls (2 Cheerleaders and 2 Bloodweiser Girls). All these miniatures were very well received by our customers, so we decided to release a whole Meiko Lizardmen Team: 6 Skinks, 6 Saurus, a new Star Player nº 2 (Saurus Silly Billy) and several more Coaching Staff minis (Coach, Apothecary…). <br/></span></p>
<p align=""justify""><span lang=""EN-US"">The sculpting of most of these miniatures has already been made. But we need your help to speed up the casting process. That way, we will be able to release the Meiko Lizardmen Team much sooner than what was initially planned. Using Indiegogo as a platform to rise funds helps us a lot since we can finance new miniatures, obtain feedback from our customers and it gives us confidence to keep working on. </span>In exchange you will get some cool rewards. <strong>All the miniatures that you will receive will be made with metal</strong>, including the Lizardmen Turn Counter.</p>
<p align=""justify""><span lang=""EN-US"">P. Ramos (a.k.a. Poncho) is the skilled sculptor of all the miniatures of the Meiko Lizardmen Team. He will also sculpt the Lizardmen Turn Counter, a great accessory for a great team. P.Ramos is currently considered by many Fantasy Football fans as one of the best Fantasy Football sculptors worldwide. His sculpting style specially fits with the Lizardmen race, since he has a special gift to give shape to the Lizardmen minis that we all have in mind. You don’t believe us? Please take a look at the images, we hope that will change your mind.</span></p>

My name is Dinko Kundalic and I'm a published comic artist and an amateur flash game designer. For the last few months me, my brother Damir Kundalic, and a friend Reagan Mcclellan have been brain storming ways to make a new type of MMO game that will bring new concepts to this game genre. After a lot of scribbling and sketching we finally got it. The game is going to feature a unique command and conquer system where a team can actually win over territories, or lose them if they don't make an effort to defend them. You will start as a simple army recruit in a 20foot/6meter fully customizable Mech unit for 1 of 3 teams of your choice. Each of the 3 teams will have their own territories on the world map, with ranging concentration of forces and defenses. You will be able to choose to defend your own territory, or attack the enemy teams territory depending on your level (obviously a level 1 player isn't going to attack a capital city). The leveling up system is also going to be some what unique. The amount of exp points you gain is going to be based on the type of enemies you fight. Attacking high level enemies gains you a lot of points, while even killing enemies that are too many levels under you will get you none. But even more than that, loosing to players who are a few levels below you will actually subtract exp point you currently have. I think that is enough information about the game for now, we don't want to give away everything at once.





The Impact

Why is this game important to us and to you perhaps. This is going to be a new type of MMO game where you actually accomplish something through killing hundreds of enemies and exploring hundreds of miles. This isn't going to be yet another useless MMORPG game that you can play for hours on end and no one else can even see the difference you made in your virtual world. So what I'm trying to say is that this will be the making of something different that people will refer to in years to come and will probably be playing updated versions of.




What We Need & What You Get
We need a lot of money to make this game happen. I have a full time job and 2 par time ones, so my time for now it limited and the money I earn is not nearly enough to fund a professional game making team to make my dream come true. Luckily I and my brother are artists, and as such are gifted in certain areas that are needed from making graphics for these kind of games. Oh, and my friend I told you about, ""Reagan Mcclellan"" just happens to be a semi professional game programmer.

We don't expect you to give us money for nothing, For everyone who backs our project we got something in stored.



Other Ways You Can Help
We need more programmers to help us directly, or just with some advise. Your work will not go unnoticed, you will be given recondition as aprogrammer in the credits.

<p>We're pretty cool people. We like playing games with cool people. Not everyone is as cool as you though. The game is meant to be played for fun, and no one has to perform an action that makes them uncomfortable. We understand (no we don't) that some people don't want to take their clothes off or drink. We made it easy to differentiate the clothing/drinking cards so you can play with your lame ass church group on Sundays and your awesome fucking party crew on the 4th of July.</p>
<p>Conceptually, the game is a bit different from other games you have played, it's left to the players to fill in ways to make the cards more fun. It's more of a loose framework of stuff for you to do rather than cards with strict rules. We leave it open-ended on purpose so y'all* can agree on what you think is the most fun way to play the game.</p>
<p>Players take cards from the deck, fill in any blanks, then place them face down on the table. They then take turns drawing each card and performing the action listed. Some actions are tame - ""Hug the person to your left."" Others... well... we hope you wore clean underwear (and so does the person to your right).</p>

Make 'Em Ups™ is one part Kings Cup, one part Battle Wizards, one part Cards Against
Humanity®, and one part Mad Libs®. The gameplay is very loose and open to
interpretation so you and your friends can decide exactly how much fun you want to have.
(Hint: It should be ALL the fun. Unless you are boring. Then you should go back
to that Apples to Apples® knock off.)





You sound like a drunk Swede invading Canada
I'm the opposite of the person you say that to.
Oh so you did the Gymnasty
Well the neighbors got a good show

Not the first time I've been kicked out of IHOP.
My boss makes me drink, on purpose.
The world will look up and shout ""Save us!""
And I'll look down and whisper ""Hodor.""
the game made me do it.
I've never seen hodor, hodor so emphatically.
Hello, sunshine! Now go away.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Indiana has set a precedent that we feel is unacceptable. With the recent <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/03/what-makes-indianas-religious-freedom-law-different/388997/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Religious Freedom Restoration Act</a>, Indiana has introduced a law that allows business owners to legally <strike>discriminate</strike> impose their religious freedom upon the LGBT community. Naturally, being game designers, we are protesting this in the only way we know how: by making a card game. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<div>In RFRA:TCG, the object of the game is to spend your money before your friends. Players take turns by deciding whether they want to safely shop online or take their chances by visiting a local Indiana business. Be careful though! Because of the new RFRA, a business has the religious right to kick you out of the store if your character believes in something they don't approve of.</div>
<div>This is a fun, quick game that illustrates the absurdities of the new Indiana law. We guarantee you will have at least 5 minutes of fun and the peace of mind knowing that you donated to a worthy cause.<br/><br/>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are asking for $100,000, although frankly any dollar amount will suffice. Where will this money go? 100% of it will be donated to <a href=""http://www.glaad.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GLAAD</a>, a 501(c)(3) non for profit organization which supports the LGBT community. <b>Your contribution is tax deductible</b>. <b>So donate now!</b></p>
<p>What will you get in return? What, the warm fuzzy feeling of knowing that you have donated to a just progressive cause isn't enough for you? Ok fine, you get to play this admittedly hastily created game that we feel is fun, funny, but most importantly highlights the potential impacts on LGBT people in Indiana.</p>
<p>Upon donating at least $5, at the conclusion of the campaign you will receive a print-and-play document which will allow you to print your own copy of RFRA:TCG (Religious Freedom Restoraction Act: The Card Game). Currently there are no plans to print a physical card game (except for the $1,000 pledge level), but who knows, maybe if enough people hate the idea we will make it into a bonafide game.</p>

</div></div>","We have been Greenlit on our Kickstarter campaign! Thank you to everyone for their support!Magic was thought long vanished from the world of Gallantia after a civil war between the ancient wizards and the armies of man. Until now....We've been featured on:

Outside of Asia, the potential of visual novels, to this day, remains largely untapped. The recent success of the Kickstarter campaign of Afterthought Studios’A More Beautiful World gives me hope as it sees to combine aspects from both sides of the prime meridian. - Haogamers
Afterthought Studios has the beginnings of a great game in their hands and it is exciting to see where they will move Violetta as the game moves forward, especially when it comes to friendship or romance! If you’re into complex stories that focus on individuals but on relationships and worlds as well or if you enjoy magical, traveling story lines like those inSpice and Wolf or Maoyuu Maou Yuusha, please consider checking out the lovely demo! - Hayurika
Our GUI has also been staff picked on Portfolium!



Magic vanished when the ancient wizards who ruled Gallantia were ousted by the armies of man. Knowledge of the arcane and the ones who worked the ancient Blessings were lost - buried in the sands of time.   


Magic has been relegated to the realm of myth, of superstition. Yet, myths often have a basis in truth, and a chance encounter in the Eternal Forest could change the world forever.
Join Violetta, the Witch of Everlasting Journeys, as she travels through an expansive fantasy setting rich in history and lore on an epic quest to discover if mankind has truly made ""A More Beautiful World"" in the absence of miracles.
What will she find at the end of her adventure? Hope for a brighter tomorrow, or despair in the nature of man? That's the question YOU will have to help answer.
Inspired by novels such as 'Spice and Wolf' and 'Maoyuu Maou Yuusha', A More Beautiful World follows their tradition of placing emphasis on relationships, money and politics. 
As you join Violetta, expect to see many familiar elements in her journey; history buffs will also pick out real world events reflected in the story from China, Europe and the Americas.That's the question that remains to be answered.


Fans of classical literature can expect to find allusions to their favourite works in the visual novel too! Will you join Violetta on her journey?


Curious for a taste of the visual novel? 
Please follow this link to download our demo! It spans about 60% of the length of Act I, an estimated 60-80 minutes in playtime. There are four Acts in total, with Act II being similar to Act I in length while Act III and IV combined are three times longer than Acts I and II.
Do note that our revamped demo is coming to the Steam Store soon.
The demo is also hosted on Mediafire and IndieDB.
Do note that this demo is merely a sample of the narrative experience that A More Beautiful World seeks to offer!




In Act I, Violetta meets the Merchant; in the later acts, she will meet many other characters while bidding farewell to her previous companions.




Afterthought Studios' aim is to create stories that resound with our readers and inspire them to apply lessons to their daily lives. We are experienced creators and visual novel enthusiasts from around the world who came together to create a story worth being retold for the ages.
Our author, Darren Kwok, is based in Singapore. He has assisted in the marketing and greenlighting for several visual novels and games.

He has previously assisted industry veterans Garry Schyman (Shadow of Mordor, Bioshock series) and Penka Kouneva (Gears of War 3, Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands). Melin is also a writer for Vision1 Music and AudioJungle music libraries.

<h1 style=""font-weight: big;""><strong>2/6 ¿Por qué ofrecerlo desde una campaña?  <br/><em>Why from a campaign?</em></strong></h1>
<p>El motivo de crear esta campaña es para ofrecer este material a precio de fábrica, el mismo del que disfrutaría un comprador mayorista.</p>
<p>Esta línea de productos fue diseñada y puesta a la venta hace ya algún tiempo, siendo por tanto un producto testeado que ofrece todas las garantías. Podéis ver una gran cantidad de fotos.</p>
<p>Debido a los procesos de fabricación, y a la mano de obra que requieren estos productos, podemos ofrecer mejores precios y condiciones a nuestros clientes, si fabricamos una gran cantidad de piezas, en lugar de hacerlo en pequeñas demandas. Ese es el motivo por el que hacemos la campaña. ¡¡Nuestro beneficio será el de nuestros clientes!!</p>
<p><b>¿Cuándo entregamos vuestra escenografía?</b> Toda la escenografía se entregará entre la <b>segunda quincena de Marzo y Junio de 2014</b>, haciendo un esfuerzo para evitar retrasarnos todo lo que podamos.</p>

2/6 ¿Por qué ofrecerlo desde una campaña?  Why from a campaign?
El motivo de crear esta campaña es para ofrecer este material a precio de fábrica, el mismo del que disfrutaría un comprador mayorista.
Esta línea de productos fue diseñada y puesta a la venta hace ya algún tiempo, siendo por tanto un producto testeado que ofrece todas las garantías. Podéis ver una gran cantidad de fotos.
Debido a los procesos de fabricación, y a la mano de obra que requieren estos productos, podemos ofrecer mejores precios y condiciones a nuestros clientes, si fabricamos una gran cantidad de piezas, en lugar de hacerlo en pequeñas demandas. Ese es el motivo por el que hacemos la campaña. ¡¡Nuestro beneficio será el de nuestros clientes!!
¿Cuándo entregamos vuestra escenografía? Toda la escenografía se entregará entre la segunda quincena de Marzo y Junio de 2014, haciendo un esfuerzo para evitar retrasarnos todo lo que podamos.

If you have reached this fundraiser page after the end of the fundraiser, please visit our website, WhukGames.com, for more details on the progress of Cassiopeia Drift, and additional details on how you can help!

Cassiopeia Drift
Whuk Games is proud to announce the up-and-coming Space Action title, Cassiopeia Drift. This multiplayer game will be released in Q1 2014, and focuses on a post-apocalyptic human society, decimated and driven from their home under mysterious circumstances. Players will fly through space, harvesting resources to build ships, command space stations, manage shops, and more! Donate now to help it become shiny!
Gameplay

In this game, you play a citizen of humanity, exiled from our galaxy. Choose to ally with any of a number of factions or remain independent. Fly solo or team up to explore this strange new galaxy. Rebuild your forces and prepare to exact revenge! Experience the free flight style of Freelancer, the fleet management style of Homeworld, the space station management style of Far Gate, and if we reach those stretch goals, look forward to the space station interior style of Battlefront 2 and the level editing style of Evil Genius.
F.A.Q.How are you different from Eve Online?Besides being Free to Play? Our game will allow you to actually pilot and customize your own ship. Switch colors, add decals, adjust weapon mount points. Our missions will have better, more interesting rewards, and you can solo them. You don't have to join a faction. Our game will have an ongoing inspirational storyline. We will allow you to fly from planet to planet, from star to star without 'warping to a grid'. Mining will be automated, and you can even leave the asteroid or planet and get notifications from homing beacons to come back when your mining drones are full. You will be able to interact with asteroids and planets; exploit the resources, make stations on the surface, and employ the services of the native populations!

What if you don't make your goal?We are releasing Cassiopeia Drift in Q1 2014, but we would like to make it the best game it can be. For that, we need your help!
Why do you need all this money? Where will it go?We are putting the money toward the cost of software licenses, hiring extra talent, acquiring software to get a better quality of work done, and feeding our faces to keep the development going.
How much will the game cost?The game will be free-to-play, so you can still play the game with your friends. The DVD will be available in the Whuk Games store for the cost of $24.99 before shipping. The DVD with Soundtrack will be available for $39.99. The game also can be purchased digitally for $10, which allows you to pilot Carrier motherships and operate Slipstream engines! The signed Collectors Editions are only available through this campaign!
What can I do in this game? What's your vision?Fly and interact with a variety of space vessels of varying sizes from tiny Scout ships to huge Carriers and the Ark Ship. Take on missions and hire red-shirts to expedite your progress, as well as to repair your ship, manufacture new items, research new technologies. Capitalize on the curious effects of spatial anomalies and ancient alien artifacts. You can even start your own space station to control systems, currencies, and governments!
Design a portion of the game? What's that mean?At the Admiral contributor level, you get to design or redesign a major portion of the game, for a limited time! We will make you an honorary member of Whuk Games. You will have creative control over a portion of game lore, the history and appearance of a default faction, the default designs for a class of starships, the ultimate fate of one of the five arks, or a minigame of your own design. The choice is completely up to you.

With your donation, you will work with our game artist to design your own awesome space-faring alien creature, and see it come to life within the game!Ark Captain: Five arks left Sol to escape the impending doom offered by the threat.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Anyone who has ever tried to produce an independent film knows the trials and tribulations of reaching a broad audience.  Today, the savy indie producer has to think beyond the big screen.  That's the reason I've created the WANT A RIDE? mobile game, to entertain while briging attention to my upcoming feature film MARTY AND VAHE TAKE A RIDE.</p>
<p>The money raised via this campaign will go directly to the design, and creation of WANT A RIDE mobile game.  With your help we will create a fun, enteraining game, that stands on its own with addictive play while promoting the feature film MARTY AND VAHE TAKE A RIDE.</p>
<p>Each level of the game consists of a maze in the style of various cities around the U.S..The player navigates from the maze entrance to the destination (designated by a  labeled garage), with the primary goal of making it there before the other player. While en route, the maze will suddenly rotate, causing disorientation and change in direction that the player must deal with in order to complete his goal.  Along the way the player will have the option of completing additional objectives and collecting items but must remember to make it through the maze before time runs out! A fun and challenging experience for everyone!</p>

Olympics myself and have seen first hand how hard it is.  :)  My event is cross-country skiing.  I'm certainly a long shot as I just 
began training last year and am 36 years old with no experience in 
this sport. With all that said, I have done a few things
 to increase my chances: I quit my day job to focus solely on skiing this past year, I have a coach who's worked with past Olympians, and I even changed my citizenship.  Turns out Colombia doesn't have a strong winter sports tradition, so by being a citizen of Colombia, I have significantly less competition on the national level (read: none) :)  This is still going to be a difficult challenge as I 
need to qualify under a certain time set by the Olympic Committee.Over this past year, I've encountered many Olympic hopefuls who are giving everything they've got to be at the opening ceremonies this upcoming February.  The costs to these individuals are extraordinary; from putting education and family plans on hold to driving themselves deep into debt all to be a part of the greatest celebration in the world.  With this campaign, I'd like to donate proceeds from my video game to other Olympic hopefuls to 
follow their dreams.  I'll be focusing on foundations in Finland and 
Colombia as these two countries have been very accommodating during my 
journey to qualify for the Olympics.  With your contribution, we can help Olympic hopefuls reach their dream of participating in the games. 






The game cleverly titled Team Paul Skiing will be a fun side-scroller tapping game for iOS devices.  The genre of this game is known as an endless runner.  With the tap of your fingers you determine the speed of which Paul skis move and when there are obstacles in his way, with the swipe of your finger you destroy the obstacles. There will be 3 levels set in the following locations: Finland, where I started my training; Colombia, where I'll be on roller skis; and the final level will be in Russia at the Olympics facing my competition and most likely finishing last place :P 


We have some fun prizes, so I hope you will contribute to this campaign! The game is slated for mid-December completion.  

By reaching the 10k goal we're still operating at a major loss but we really want the money raised to go to olympics hopefuls.  The breakdown of the funds will be that 50% of the proceeds go to youth sports foundations.  The remaining 50% will go towards development, perks, shipping etc.




On5: The Game is led by Egor and his development team On5.  They have developed numerous games for iOS and Android devices and have worked with large publishers such as Electronic Arts, Atari, DeNA/ngmoco, Samsung.  Over 10 million people have enjoyed playing their games.

<h3>How the idea was born ?</h3>
<p>The JinxOnU idea was born out of a question i asked my self : Who am i ? One of the answers i gave myself was that i like to laugh at myself and others. In a good and friendly way. As i gave it more thought it turned out that it's not easy to prank your friends effectively and with little effort. Is there an app that will allow me to do it easily ? As i browsed the different app markets, all i could find are story tellers jokes of all kinds, and some that perform some things to your own device. But what about pulling a practical joke on my friends ? for this question there was no answer.</p>
<h3>Project Status</h3>
<p>The current status of the project is that the game is actually finished, fully functional, tested extensively and about to be beta launched these days.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Actually its quite simple - we need your support to further invest in marketing so we can distribute the game to a much larger audience.</p>
<p>In return to your support you'll get personal gradidutes with the game logo, even get to pick a future Jinx to be implemented into the game.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The mobile app market is truely flooded with apps of all shapes, kind and form. The marketing efforts take a lot of time, effort and financial backbone to pull it off successfully. We won't be able to do it without your contributions and support. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>In addition to supporting our marketing efforts by contributing to this project, you can also help by posting about the game on facebook. Word of mouth is one of the most effective ways in the social media era and every one count.</p>

<h2>FUNDING AND DEVELOPMENT<br/>
</h2>
<ul><br/></ul>
<p> $15,000 is our starting goal to get the Alpha running. The total cost of the game will be $75,000 for the first version to go public, but with $15,000 we can get something that will get people more than excited for the final version. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Where is this money going and how will it be used?</p>
<p>GUN SIMULATOR will support 8k Resolutions, so we will be renting a 8k Camera to take over 1,000 8k photos of every gun, gun part, etc..</p>
<p>We will be using the highest FPS camera we can afford (1,000-1,000,000) and firing the guns under different kinds of conditions.</p>
<p>Audio will be taken not only by the gun, but hundreds of locations up to 1 mile away to get the most realistic audio of the gun no matter how far away you are from it in the game.<br/></p>
<p>Gun bullets, including different round types, will be fired into the gel like dummies (similar to the ones used in ""Deadliest Warrior"") to get the most accurate in game simulation damage.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Future Goals;</p>
<p>Oculus Support</p>
<p>Playstation 4 Support</p>
<p>Upload your face and in game characters lip syncing to your talking.</p>
<p>Different ways to hold your gun.<br/></p>

 Weapon Customization will be greater than any game in existence. You will be able to break apart every weapon and see exactly how it works, if you so choose. And a lot of parts, can be replaced or added on.


FUNDING AND DEVELOPMENT


 $15,000 is our starting goal to get the Alpha running. The total cost of the game will be $75,000 for the first version to go public, but with $15,000 we can get something that will get people more than excited for the final version. 

Where is this money going and how will it be used?
GUN SIMULATOR will support 8k Resolutions, so we will be renting a 8k Camera to take over 1,000 8k photos of every gun, gun part, etc..
We will be using the highest FPS camera we can afford (1,000-1,000,000) and firing the guns under different kinds of conditions.
Audio will be taken not only by the gun, but hundreds of locations up to 1 mile away to get the most realistic audio of the gun no matter how far away you are from it in the game.
Gun bullets, including different round types, will be fired into the gel like dummies (similar to the ones used in ""Deadliest Warrior"") to get the most accurate in game simulation damage.

Future Goals;
Oculus Support
Playstation 4 Support
Upload your face and in game characters lip syncing to your talking.
Different ways to hold your gun.

<h3>Me, My Campaign and You</h3>
<p>Hey, You :) Welcome to my campaigns page! I really appreciate your presence here. My name is Kaspar-Hardi and I am the head behind The Silent Sky, the animator and the writer, the developer and the producer, the author as they would say. This started out as my personal project where I invested my free time for the last 7 years, which led to a small team of three. It's been a slow process and I always wanted to speed it up.</p>
<p>I have been fascinated by animations from the ground up, always captivated by the unlimited ways how animation can deliver the story, the vision of someones imagination and The Silent Sky is no exception.</p>
<p>If everything is possible in ones imagination, then everything is possible in animation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564886104/yaczdeo1yrjsfde8b0lc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>As the <strong>adventurous</strong> heart who once dreamed to tell stories, I can now finally put them on the table and make it real. With the help of You of course.</p>
<p>When I went traveling I experienced something that expanded my imagination. That was a recognition from my childhood that reminded me how crucial the adventures are for us to sprout and mature, to seek journeys life offers in order to grow.</p>
<p>That's when I also started to do my first sketches and write the first ideas about the story. I hate to say, it's been almost a decade now. The money had to come from somewhere, right. But I have never let that adventurous heart to die and this establishes a strong commitment for me to do what I love, this project, and if I can share it with the world...</p>
<p>Whats better than that, right!?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564367714/zg1rgmilz1qoz7hzwazw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We will make it happen one way or another, I'm pretty good at washing dishes now, so slowly and slowly, one day we would have the game completed ;) but I would prefer to skip the dishes part and keep my heart and strong faith for this project, and with Your help this could happen so much faster and probably so much better.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>But because we do this on our free time and none of us doesn’t have it as much as we would like, we don't really get to choose the release date.</p>
<p>We all want to fully commit and with helping us you don’t just help with this project, you also might help to start a little studio, where more games like this could be crafted.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Is set in 2005 in a small town of Estonia, Eastern Europe, a place nobody really knows about, where hardly anything happens and where everybody knows everybody. It's about a boy, Siim, who's 10 years old, eager for an adventures and who encounters a mysterious event just right on his backyard of the house. He can't resist on going to explore what it is and finds something he is not supposed to find. The discovery drags him into a world of secrets and conspiracies taking him to the end of the world, space and the stars. When struggling with many things that comes with the unknown, also the seriousness of the world orchestrated by an adult mind, he needs to keep his candid spirit up and find his way back home.</p>
<p>You as Siim are sent to many different places of the earth and off the earth, where you encounter many different unique characters who help and assist in different ways or stop you as you become a potential threat.</p>
<p>The story narration runs in a linear fashion but offers many different dialog choices that brings up more reactions in dialogues and are a nice touch of bringing up the characteristics to make the game much more colorful and enjoyable to play. After all it's a story to tell.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>For this campaign I chose flexible funding. It has its drawbacks but at least it gives us some sort of boost to bring this game closer to the release date with some, if not all, of the goals we've set.</p>
<p>I know, the assurance is never there and it takes time to build up the trust but nothing is easy even for the developers. The campaign brings up a new responsibility and I don't want to promise too much big things, though I would like to, big dreamer as I am :) but my goal is to get this project done as successfully as possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564788799/uewn7artumtuj2lytn60.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>And this is where You can help us! :) With the help of You we can achieve something great or magnificent. You choose :)</p>
<p>It could be text based, it could be with audio dialogs. Both have their advantages. Text is easier, can be quickly achieved and leaves more room for imagination. Audio dialogs would bring up the uniqueness of characters. It is totally achievable but it takes just more time and resources. There is a middle ground where I could do both, text and a little bit of audio to support.</p>
<p>It could be simple, or more compelling. I would like to add more cinematic clips, custom animations, smooth the transitions with extra frames were possible and add more interactive content to make the delivering of the story more beautiful and captivating. Also would like to keep the game flow longer with more scenes, characters and adding more sections to the story.</p>
<p>It could be an ambience based or more melodic. Music has a very important role. This is also quite a responsible work and I am not satisfied if it doesn't deliver the spirit of the game. Though it's gonna be a lot of ambience based to keep you in the story, music still has its place. We already have some nice tracks, but still need to work on it and that's a job for another artist who knows its work. Original composition would be the way to go, but still a lot can be achieved by a royalty free music from many talented artists if we don’t reach the desired goal.</p>
<p>(I am happy to announce that we stumbled upon a great artist <strong>Peter Nanasi</strong>, who already has created a wonderful piece of audio track that brings The Silent Sky alive. And would be cool if he could make us more of those :) Check out his Soundcloud <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/nanasipeter"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://soundcloud.com/nanasipeter</a> page and have a little taste of his talent)</p>
<p>Game could have one language or translated into many. Well, to be honest, its already prepared for English and Estonian. But to make it available for more wider audience we would like to add couple more options like French, Spanish and perhaps German.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Major part of our time, also the funding, would go for animations and programming. It is simply a process that just takes time and we don't like to settle with simple and quick results. Though most of complicated animations are done, they still need to be updated, improved or retouched. We are still in a early stage and a lot of art work, puzzles and recordings need to be made and implemented. On top of that a lot of experimenting and testing.</p>

Having no memories at all, it must make its way in search for answers, in a world of forgotten devices and hostile creatures, while a somehow familiar voice within claims to know its mind better than itself.<br/><p><a href=""http://www.krakenempire.com/kromaia/igg/Kromaia_Kyllene_01_LARGE.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/74660/files/20130914194612-Kromaia_Kyllene_01.jpg?1379213172"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>According to the mechanical armor system log, the shrine and the infinite void surrounding it, Kyllene, is actually an artificial anomaly. It serves as an access port to several parallel realities, recorded copies of the original Universe, presumably collapsed. Kyllene's very existence seems related to this copies and its machinery appears not to be 100% functional.</p>

We do think so. For that reason, you will not find in Kromaia slow movement, ships maneuvering like planes or boats, nor endless steering pursuits in circles, but a completely different approach. Our navigation system is entirely driven by physical forces, a different set of thrusters is arranged for each ship in order to maximize maneuverability: Fluid displacement for novices and, for experts, impossible turns and extreme dodging, combined with a powerful multidirectional boost system that allows moving over the real speed of sound in any way you can imagine.<br/><p><a href=""http://www.krakenempire.com/kromaia/igg/Kromaia_Mu_01_LARGE.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/74413/files/20130914165238-Kromaia_Mu_01.jpg?1379202758"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>Forget all the vehicles you have already controlled like aircrafts, rockets, choppers or traditional spaceships, think of all of their capabilities available at the same time at the tip of your fingers. Besides, Kromaia features a special kind of emergent gameplay: Here we will use the word ""procedural"" for something different than just randomly generated worlds. The advanced A.I. system in Kromaia uses physical parameters and a sophisticated prediction model to adapt units speed, attacks, flocking and smart group formations to the actions you take during your quest. The results: the game experience is different every time depending on the way you play.</p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/74447/files/20130914170831-Kromaia_Title_The_Game.jpg?1379203711"" src="""" style=""""/></p>One of our main motivations was that we think of space as a great game environment, but we wanted to try something different from the standards prevailing in most of games. For that reason, what you will find in Kromaia is a different approach.<br/><br/><h3><b>- ZERO G MEETS ÜBER AGILITY - </b></h3>Our navigation system is entirely driven by physical forces and consists of a set of thrusters arranged in order to maximize maneuverability: Fluid displacement for novices and, for experts, impossible turns and extreme dodging, combined with boost, while moving over the real speed of sound ( 340m/s!! ). The power curve of the thrusters is directly controlled by the inputs specified on XML files which defines them, in addition to other structural and modular features.<p><a href=""http://www.krakenempire.com/kromaia/igg/Kromaia_Alpha_02_LARGE.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/74565/files/20130914182155-Kromaia_Alpha_02.jpg?1379208115"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>As we said before, not like  aircrafts or traditional spaceships, but all of them at the same time: you can even edit the unit file to change the position/orientation used by thrusters, add or remove them and modify their power capabilities; assign thrusters groups for certain inputs, as well as tuning or disabling the artificial friction system, which eases navigation in a vacuum environment like outer space.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/74588/files/20130914182933-Kromaia_XML_01.jpg?1379208573"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><b>- EMERGENT GAMEPLAY: PROCEDURALITY AT ITS BEST -</b></h3> Here we will use the word “procedural” for something different than just randomly generated worlds. The advanced A.I. system in Kromaia uses physical parameters and a sophisticated prediction model to adapt units speed, attacks, flocking and smart group formations to the actions you take during your quest. The results: the game experience is different depending on the way you play. Maybe you ace at dodging at full speed or you prefer shooting and killing everything that moves around.<p><a href=""http://www.krakenempire.com/kromaia/igg/Kromaia_Tau_01_LARGE.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/74766/files/20130914212916-Kromaia_Tau_01.jpg?1379219356"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>Maybe you prefer shooting while stopped or at a low speed, you can even move backwards while shooting. Our AI will adapt to your gameplay style and your experience will be unique, just as your game style is.</p>
<h3><b>- YOU MAKE THE WHOLE THING BE GREAT -</b></h3> The strategy chosen by the player will lead an enemy swarm to adopt an aggressive behaviour to defend an item that you are supposed to pick, or gather in number to pursuit you when you decide to be more conservative. A straight line is not necessarily the fastest/smartest to reach your goal: use asteroids to cover yourself from enemy attacks or break them to generate shockwaves; if a giant creature looks at you ready to fire a fatal beam, throw a gravity bomb to attract and turn his head. Physics + A.I. + Your Brain in all their glory!<br/><p><a href=""http://www.krakenempire.com/kromaia/igg/Kromaia_Alpha_03_LARGE.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/76543/files/20130915223730-Kromaia_Alpha_03.jpg?1379309850"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<h3><b>- WEAPONS -</b></h3> The way you play is also the way you attack and defend. Through your adventure you will be able to use a wide range of technologies, including<br/><ul>
<li>High speed impact projectiles</li>
<li>Precission laser beams</li>
<li>Smart bullets and homing missiles</li>
<li>Special items as gravity bombs</li>
<li>An energy blades melee system!</li>

<h3><b>- MOVE THE STORY FORWARD -</b></h3> We strongly believe that truly immersive experiences start with an underlying big, deeply complex system able to make the player feel like a drop in the ocean. And giving the game a story is giving the game a soul. To create this universe, we have taken inspiration from ancient mythological poems. It involves a solid cosmology, hidden legendary treasures and a “hero” gifted with great abilities, confronting by himself a whole world commanded by machine-like gods. And, like in many mythological stories, there is no good, evil or time limits. You are just given the option to trigger events and advance to see what’s next, using your power.<br/><p><a href=""http://www.krakenempire.com/kromaia/igg/Kromaia_Psi_02_LARGE.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/77392/files/20130916093427-Kromaia_Psi_02.jpg?1379349267"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<h3><b>- EXTREME ENGINEERING -</b></h3> Piloting at ultra-high speeds; moving and colliding hundreds of physical objects simultaneously; soft bodies like physical hair; multi-hull breakable entities... Is this possible avoiding at the same time those typical vibrations and precision glitches affecting ships, projectiles and cameras movement? And still have a good and fluid performance? Yes. We decided to create our own engine to break these barriers and it’s being tough, but we are passionate and mad enough to bear with that. No fairy tales here: We’ve spent more than two years since the first prototype, refining and optimizing our engine before reaching what we talk about today.<br/><p><a href=""http://www.krakenempire.com/kromaia/igg/Kromaia_Mu_02_LARGE.gif"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/77714/files/20130916120734-Kromaia_Mu_02.gif?1379358454"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>The game we want to create demanded from us to forget about some indie-related assumptions regarding “fast development”. Keeping that in mind, and after being told several times we were nuts, we decided to combine our passion and experience in the games industry with the most technical aspects regarding our professional and academic background. As a result, we built what we call an ""extreme software engineering project"" to achieve a powerful, highly flexible environment or universe in which no object could move by means of nothing but physical forces.<br/><br/><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.krakenempire.com/kromaia/igg/Kromaia_Prompt_01.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Anyway, We don’t want Kromaia to be a “closed” creation. We’re assembling a version that we think you will like, but this does not mean you can’t make another one by yourself! We are considering making a modding manual, so don’t be afraid of XML files, they are not only technical, but also fun!<br/><p><a href=""http://www.krakenempire.com/kromaia/igg/Kromaia_Alpha_04_LARGE.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/78104/files/20130916153953-Kromaia_Alpha_04.jpg?1379371193"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>Some Examples:<span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><br/></span></span></span></span></span><h4><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></span></span></h4>

To answer those questions we should refer to the very nature of this campaign, which differs from most of the crowdfunding projects out there.<br/><br/>As you may have noticed, we've already put a lot of effort and time in Kromaia, and that's why we are determined to complete the project: The main purpose of the campaign is not launching the project or deciding whether the game will be developed or not, but achieving the quality level we want for our game in this crucial stage.<br/><br/>This means that your perks are safe, even if our main goal is not reached. :)<br/><br/>With the funds achieved we will build entirely the worlds we originally designed; your help will contribute to finance the music, sound effects and the sound library licensing, as well as the extra development costs to to push our engine to the max, in addition to the company costs required to make that additional effort. Besides, these funds will allow us to afford the campaign and promotion costs, which eventually will give Kromaia the chance to create a strong community and the visibility it needs to move towards digital distribution in this huge ocean, the indie community is.

In addtition to the years of self-funding, we have had to push our engine to the limit to overcome some limitations and being able to achieve the features and performance we wanted. Now we can say we are convinced that Kromaia will be a truly unique experience and determined to give our best to complete a great game.<br/><br/>With all that work and time spent in a project, having your game more exposed to the public before it's finished is not a decision to be taken lightly, even more considering Kromaia is far from being a casual game. At its current status, the project needs to gather the support to start the race to the final release more safely, with a strong community, and then evolve according to this support to reach  the quality levels which allow the game to make its way.<br/><br/>Your help will mean a boost for our team to keep moving forward to materialize such a final effort, deal with licensing, having by our side great professionals and all the costs this final stage implies for our little company. All this will make possible to provide Kromaia with the production values in terms of engineering, art, and music to make a difference.<br/><br/>Rest assured that we will work harder than ever, and with your support Kromaia will be much more than what we dreamed of.

<p>Our team consist of just two developers, Daniel Blasco and Antonio Iglesias. All the design, engineering and art you can see in the game are the work of two guys doing their best in all the fields they know about. Music is the only thing we have outsourced.</p>
<p>We met at university while studying ""Informatics Engineering"" in our hometown, Zaragoza (Aragon, Spain), where we began to develop small games and have endless discussions on design and gameplay. Later on, we met again and worked together in a studio called ""Enigma Software Productions"" where we developed ""War Leaders: Clash of Nations"" (PC), ""History: Legends of War"" (PC, PSP, PS Vita, PS3, Xbox360) and ""Music School"" (Nintendo DS). During that time, and using the little spare time left between crunches, we started putting together a set of ideas we had been discussing for years in a new project, trying to create a different space game experience: the goal was a complex, highly immersive system or universe able to support a high amount of compound physical entities, in which no object could move by means of nothing but physical forces, while keeping a good performance.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""http://www.krakenempire.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/80440/files/20130917154431-Kromaia_Kraken_Empire_Logo_01.jpg?1379457871"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>The project kept growing and at some point we realized that the engine had the potential to become something great and worthy to share. That's how we decided to start our own studio to develop Kromaia, and that's what we have been doing for three years with no external funding at all, work, work, more work and good advices from great people in the indie community, as well as volunteers who selflessly helped us out to polish the gameplay. Additionally, the talented composer Josh Whelchel is creating an awesome soundtrack for us in order to complete this experience that we feel is so unique.</p>

Unique and immersive journey, mixing technology and myth, in an innovative gameplay experience

Get your hands one of the fastest and most agile gameplays to date

Interact with hundreds of physical objects, like asteroids, structures and devices, and fight dozens of enemies at once
Believable and destructible world with its own rules and physic laws
Breaking visual atmosphere which combines ancient architecture, mechanical artefacts and weird creatures

Artificial intelligence based on independent simple brains that cooperate creating emergent behaviours
Different selectable ships with unique weapons and capabilities
Moddable content using plain text (XML) including levels, objects, weapons, player and AI units...
Several playing modes for every kind of player: Story Mode (adventure), Score Attack (arcade), Timed Circuit (racing)...


Kromaia takes place in a multiverse and tells the story of a stranded soul who awakens in a weird shrine, finding itself sealed inside a mechanical unit. Having no memories at all, it must make its way in search for answers, in a world of forgotten devices and hostile creatures, while a somehow familiar voice within claims to know its mind better than itself.
According to the mechanical armor system log, the shrine and the infinite void surrounding it, Kyllene, is actually an artificial anomaly. It serves as an access port to several parallel realities, recorded copies of the original Universe, presumably collapsed. Kyllene's very existence seems related to this copies and its machinery appears not to be 100% functional.









Is it still possible to make something different set in outer space? We do think so. For that reason, you will not find in Kromaia slow movement, ships maneuvering like planes or boats, nor endless steering pursuits in circles, but a completely different approach. Our navigation system is entirely driven by physical forces, a different set of thrusters is arranged for each ship in order to maximize maneuverability: Fluid displacement for novices and, for experts, impossible turns and extreme dodging, combined with a powerful multidirectional boost system that allows moving over the real speed of sound in any way you can imagine.
Forget all the vehicles you have already controlled like aircrafts, rockets, choppers or traditional spaceships, think of all of their capabilities available at the same time at the tip of your fingers. Besides, Kromaia features a special kind of emergent gameplay: Here we will use the word ""procedural"" for something different than just randomly generated worlds. The advanced A.I. system in Kromaia uses physical parameters and a sophisticated prediction model to adapt units speed, attacks, flocking and smart group formations to the actions you take during your quest. The results: the game experience is different every time depending on the way you play.









One of our main motivations was that we think of space as a great game environment, but we wanted to try something different from the standards prevailing in most of games. For that reason, what you will find in Kromaia is a different approach.- ZERO G MEETS ÜBER AGILITY - Our navigation system is entirely driven by physical forces and consists of a set of thrusters arranged in order to maximize maneuverability: Fluid displacement for novices and, for experts, impossible turns and extreme dodging, combined with boost, while moving over the real speed of sound ( 340m/s!! ). The power curve of the thrusters is directly controlled by the inputs specified on XML files which defines them, in addition to other structural and modular features.
As we said before, not like  aircrafts or traditional spaceships, but all of them at the same time: you can even edit the unit file to change the position/orientation used by thrusters, add or remove them and modify their power capabilities; assign thrusters groups for certain inputs, as well as tuning or disabling the artificial friction system, which eases navigation in a vacuum environment like outer space.

- EMERGENT GAMEPLAY: PROCEDURALITY AT ITS BEST - Here we will use the word “procedural” for something different than just randomly generated worlds. The advanced A.I. system in Kromaia uses physical parameters and a sophisticated prediction model to adapt units speed, attacks, flocking and smart group formations to the actions you take during your quest. The results: the game experience is different depending on the way you play. Maybe you ace at dodging at full speed or you prefer shooting and killing everything that moves around.
Maybe you prefer shooting while stopped or at a low speed, you can even move backwards while shooting. Our AI will adapt to your gameplay style and your experience will be unique, just as your game style is.
- YOU MAKE THE WHOLE THING BE GREAT - The strategy chosen by the player will lead an enemy swarm to adopt an aggressive behaviour to defend an item that you are supposed to pick, or gather in number to pursuit you when you decide to be more conservative. A straight line is not necessarily the fastest/smartest to reach your goal: use asteroids to cover yourself from enemy attacks or break them to generate shockwaves; if a giant creature looks at you ready to fire a fatal beam, throw a gravity bomb to attract and turn his head. Physics + A.I. + Your Brain in all their glory!
- WEAPONS - The way you play is also the way you attack and defend. Through your adventure you will be able to use a wide range of technologies, including
High speed impact projectiles
Precission laser beams
Smart bullets and homing missiles
Special items as gravity bombs
An energy blades melee system!


- MOVE THE STORY FORWARD - We strongly believe that truly immersive experiences start with an underlying big, deeply complex system able to make the player feel like a drop in the ocean. And giving the game a story is giving the game a soul. To create this universe, we have taken inspiration from ancient mythological poems. It involves a solid cosmology, hidden legendary treasures and a “hero” gifted with great abilities, confronting by himself a whole world commanded by machine-like gods. And, like in many mythological stories, there is no good, evil or time limits. You are just given the option to trigger events and advance to see what’s next, using your power.
- EXTREME ENGINEERING - Piloting at ultra-high speeds; moving and colliding hundreds of physical objects simultaneously; soft bodies like physical hair; multi-hull breakable entities... Is this possible avoiding at the same time those typical vibrations and precision glitches affecting ships, projectiles and cameras movement? And still have a good and fluid performance? Yes. We decided to create our own engine to break these barriers and it’s being tough, but we are passionate and mad enough to bear with that. No fairy tales here: We’ve spent more than two years since the first prototype, refining and optimizing our engine before reaching what we talk about today.The game we want to create demanded from us to forget about some indie-related assumptions regarding “fast development”. Keeping that in mind, and after being told several times we were nuts, we decided to combine our passion and experience in the games industry with the most technical aspects regarding our professional and academic background. As a result, we built what we call an ""extreme software engineering project"" to achieve a powerful, highly flexible environment or universe in which no object could move by means of nothing but physical forces.
A huge and modular system allowing customisation for a lot of physical parameters and behaviours is great to experiment with, but complicates a bit the creation of The Editor. Anyway, We don’t want Kromaia to be a “closed” creation. We’re assembling a version that we think you will like, but this does not mean you can’t make another one by yourself! We are considering making a modding manual, so don’t be afraid of XML files, they are not only technical, but also fun!Some Examples:

Modify the scale, mass, local position and orientation for each hull of every structure unit, enemy or boss.

Redesign your propulsion system. Add or remove thrusters, modify their power and arrangement. Set movement inputs for groups of thrusters.

Modify your weaponry module. Do you want to fire at a higher rate? Do you want to use another type of projectile or a beam weapon? Do you want more cannons? Do you want to fire backwards? Do you want to throw enemy units??!! Up to you...

Modify projectiles features. Right, they have their own files, so you can edit their linear and angular velocity or set them to scale themselves with time.

Tune your units and your enemies, even bosses. Add extra and removable hulls which will come off when they are severely damaged. Attach them with fixed joints, or use physical ropes. Add layers of weak points and set physical hairs to achieve an organic appearance.

Create and add new units. You will decide whether to include many hulls, modules for weaponry or A.I., a powerful propulsion system...




Copy modules from one unit to another. If you think that a certain enemy is too friendly, give him a pair of laser cannons and regret later.

A.I. tuning for every enemy unit. Experiment with different values for angular and linear velocities, accelerations, movement type... Besides, select the behaviours to be used by A.I. groups, group movement and formations, as well as how close do you want the enemies to be before they start firing.
Create new planets and black holes with custom physical parameters, which determine the range for their gravity field.

Edit the colour layers for areas/levels and their units and structures.

Probably you are wondering how we will use the funds raised and why we chose the ""flexible funding"" model. To answer those questions we should refer to the very nature of this campaign, which differs from most of the crowdfunding projects out there.As you may have noticed, we've already put a lot of effort and time in Kromaia, and that's why we are determined to complete the project: The main purpose of the campaign is not launching the project or deciding whether the game will be developed or not, but achieving the quality level we want for our game in this crucial stage.This means that your perks are safe, even if our main goal is not reached. :)With the funds achieved we will build entirely the worlds we originally designed; your help will contribute to finance the music, sound effects and the sound library licensing, as well as the extra development costs to to push our engine to the max, in addition to the company costs required to make that additional effort. Besides, these funds will allow us to afford the campaign and promotion costs, which eventually will give Kromaia the chance to create a strong community and the visibility it needs to move towards digital distribution in this huge ocean, the indie community is. Let's go!

As we said, the way to reach this point has not been easy at all. In addtition to the years of self-funding, we have had to push our engine to the limit to overcome some limitations and being able to achieve the features and performance we wanted. Now we can say we are convinced that Kromaia will be a truly unique experience and determined to give our best to complete a great game.With all that work and time spent in a project, having your game more exposed to the public before it's finished is not a decision to be taken lightly, even more considering Kromaia is far from being a casual game. At its current status, the project needs to gather the support to start the race to the final release more safely, with a strong community, and then evolve according to this support to reach  the quality levels which allow the game to make its way.Your help will mean a boost for our team to keep moving forward to materialize such a final effort, deal with licensing, having by our side great professionals and all the costs this final stage implies for our little company. All this will make possible to provide Kromaia with the production values in terms of engineering, art, and music to make a difference.Rest assured that we will work harder than ever, and with your support Kromaia will be much more than what we dreamed of.












Hey, Daniel here!
Hi there! I'm Antonio!


Our team consist of just two developers, Daniel Blasco and Antonio Iglesias. All the design, engineering and art you can see in the game are the work of two guys doing their best in all the fields they know about. Music is the only thing we have outsourced.
We met at university while studying ""Informatics Engineering"" in our hometown, Zaragoza (Aragon, Spain), where we began to develop small games and have endless discussions on design and gameplay. Later on, we met again and worked together in a studio called ""Enigma Software Productions"" where we developed ""War Leaders: Clash of Nations"" (PC), ""History: Legends of War"" (PC, PSP, PS Vita, PS3, Xbox360) and ""Music School"" (Nintendo DS). During that time, and using the little spare time left between crunches, we started putting together a set of ideas we had been discussing for years in a new project, trying to create a different space game experience: the goal was a complex, highly immersive system or universe able to support a high amount of compound physical entities, in which no object could move by means of nothing but physical forces, while keeping a good performance.

The project kept growing and at some point we realized that the engine had the potential to become something great and worthy to share. That's how we decided to start our own studio to develop Kromaia, and that's what we have been doing for three years with no external funding at all, work, work, more work and good advices from great people in the indie community, as well as volunteers who selflessly helped us out to polish the gameplay. Additionally, the talented composer Josh Whelchel is creating an awesome soundtrack for us in order to complete this experience that we feel is so unique.


This campaign would be impossible without some great people helping us set everything up for the Indiegogo launch, and, in some cases, since the very beginning of the project, so let us introduce them!


Kevin Greenlee, AKA LoudCore is a critically acclaimed US Video Game Composer and Music Producer. Since his start in 2006, he has been able to compose music for a wide variety of games and other media outlets. He is best known for working with StarForge.


David Daza is (an experienced comic-book artist. He has worked for several publishers in USA and Spain – Dark Horse (STAR WARS), IDW Publishing (TRANSFORMERS), Moonstone Books and Planeta-DeAgostini among others.


Josh Whelchel is a video game music composer and enthusiast, also scoring for Castle Story and Mojang's Scrolls.  He brings years of experience to the Kromaia soundscape, including a love for spacy geometry inspired landscapes.

<b>Who We Are</b><br/>
</h2><p>Stone
Soup Entertainments, LLC was created in 2013 after 3 years of
tabletop gaming. Every Saturday, we would go to our friend’s house
and spend hours creating characters and campaigns that pushed the
limits of the rules. After customizing every game we came across, we
decided that instead of altering existing rules we should create our
own from scratch. While creating the rules, we realized that much of
the fun we were accustomed to was from creating the many customized
characters and situations that worked within the existing rules.
Given this realization, we decided on a game which required the most
minimum of rules and was compatible with every literary genre.</p>
<p>The
name Stone Soup Entertainments, LLC represents the fundamental goal
of the company and its projects. The name is based around an old
folktale where hungry travelers come to a village, carrying nothing
more than an empty cooking pot. Upon their arrival, the villagers are
unwilling to share any of their food stores with the hungry
travelers. Then the travelers go to a stream and fill the pot with
water, drop a large stone in it, and place it over a fire. The
villagers, curious to the soup they are making, hand them a little
bit of seasoning to help them out. More and more villagers walk by,
each adding another ingredient. Finally, a delicious and nourishing
pot of soup is enjoyed by all.</p>
<p>The
moral of the story, and by extension the Light-On-Rules-Engine, is
that the more you put into the “soup”, the more you gain. The
Light-On-Rules-Engine is designed to give players the room necessary
to add in game play elements to enhance their personal level of play;
this allows for an unlimited amount of play options for you and your
gaming group to enjoy.</p><p>
</p><p>Sean
Williams first became a part of Stone Soup Entertainments, LLC after playing various types of
role-playing games. Driven with the desire to create something that
millions would enjoy, Sean was eager to begin working on something he felt would be able to combine elements that everyone could enjoy. Combining his
knowledge of science with his passion for writing, Sean compiled
every idea and concept and helped establish a company with a solid
product that will continue to pave the way for creativity and
critical thinking in gaming across a wide audience.</p>
<p></p><h3>What the Game Means to Us<br/>
</h3><p>The Light-On-Rules-Engine is a quick and simple tabletop gaming experience designed to allow for limitless customization and endless hours of unique game play. For the last year, we at Stone Soup Entertainments, LLC have been creating the bare minimum of rules needed so that the game can be picked up and played by both veteran and first time role players. The final result has been a game system that can be molded to any type of game world or quickly adapted to a game world that you have already established. This last year has seen the company Stone Soup Entertainments, LLC become a hard earned reality so that we would be able to construct a viable ""launch pad for dreams."" Overcoming what obstacles we have come across, we have been able to construct our first product that we wish to launch into the gaming community. We are actually 90% of the way to completing our launch, but this last stretch is so important that we are going to need the help of the community now more than ever.<br/></p>
<p>The
contents of the book has been fully written and we are currently editing the final layout of the art on the cover and within its pages. Once done, we will be ready to take orders via our website and begin bulk printing. This will allow us the necessary time to work on the future products that we have lined up to be used in conjunction with the Light-On-Rules-Engine rule book. This means that we will be periodically releasing new content that will both enhance your game play as well as introduce settings that you can play in; the new content will give you a starting point to create a campaign or give you ideas to create your own. The Light-On-Rules-Engine is specifically made to give future campaign designers the freedom to create any world imaginable. Our goal is to encourage gamers to use their imagination more freely in an environment that adapts to their play style.</p><p></p><p>The Light-On-Rules-Engine is just the first step on our journey. The 
rulebook is there to show what the base mechanics of the game are to 
quickly get future players acclimated to the system. The majority of the
 funds raised via Indiegogo will go towards completing the scenario 
books entitled War Powers and Looking Glass.</p>
<p>War Powers is a pseudo-futuristic setting where people with super 
powers dominate everyday life and where military actions are governed by
 a board of directors rather than a central government. The first module
 centers around a group of soldiers working for America’s Rapid Response
 Operational Warfare Service (A.R.R.O.W.S.) as they try to find the 
people responsible for a brutal killing.</p>
<p>Looking Glass is a high fantasy setting that takes place during World
 War I. The German army has pushed their way into the realm of 
Wonderland and try to manipulate the barriers between worlds in an 
effort to tip the outcome of the war in their favor. As the barrier 
weakens, random people are constantly being drawn in to this surreal 
landscape and find themselves in the middle of a war on two fronts. It’s
 up to them to decide how they wish to get home.</p><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Our Impact on the Community<br/>
</h3>After years of being a part of the gaming community as a whole, we believe that it is our time to give something back and we feel that everyone should be a vital part of the process. We want to share our thoughts with everyone in the community and allow them the ability to share their own thoughts. We can accomplish this by creating a forum for the free flow of ideas and creative thinking. By allowing players in the community to express themselves, we will be able to create more enriched content in the future and strengthen the community by accepting their input. A big part of the Light-On-Rules-Engine is to listen to and adapt to the input of the community so that it will change shape to better suit the community's needs.<br/><br/>Using our website as a portal for the community's ideas, we will create special community areas so that players and campaign designers can share their created content. This will allow the players to communicate with each other and find like-minded individuals that they can be connected to. We hope that this will change the way our players think of community gaming and inspire a new generation of player/creator interaction. We would be happy to share our favorite player-created campaigns periodically as well as continuously release new campaigns that we have created.<br/><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>With every way that we are promoting our campaign, you can help promote it via any social media or publishing venue that you know. If you have a group of friends that you regularly game with, you can mention this project to them and help spread the word. Share and Like our Facebook page or follow us on Twitter.</p><h2><b>Funding Our Campaign</b></h2><p>The bulk of the funding is going towards hiring a full time team of writers and artists to continue to provide quality products that fit with the Light-On-Rules-Engine. Working on a commission basis, we have only been able to get so far and with your support we'll be able to include even more art than we have now.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/642366/files/20140611134241-Game_Cover_with_text.jpg?1402519361"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Cover by Ken Bastard<br/></p><p><br/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p>The Shootout by Ken Bastard<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/642375/files/20140611134344-The_Shootout_Small.jpg?1402519424"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p>The GI's by Ken Bastard<br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/642377/files/20140611134402-The_GI_s_8.5_x_11.jpg?1402519442"" src="""" style=""width: 588px; height: 761px;""/></p>The Tavern by Aga Marlon<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/642378/files/20140611134419-Tavern-HiRes.jpg?1402519459"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>Repairs by Sheree Hill.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/642382/files/20140611134443-2014-04-04_15_58_51-ShipConcept1-3.psd___33.png?1402519483"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/><h2><b>Game Play Examples</b></h2><br/>These are the examples we've made during our live stream on Twitch.tv.

<p>The game focuses on the story of Oliver.<br/>Oliver is an eccentric pirate seeking treasures.<br/>And survives mostly by using wit and negotiation rather than weapons or force.<br/>Our hero will arrive to an island and the only way to start the adventure is with your help.</p>
<p>The initial plan is to have 4 chapters on the game. If we reach extra goals we can add a 5th and 6th chapter.<br/>We hope to have the game done in around mid 2014.</p>
<p>With your help, Caribbean Island will become a reality—forged by Voon in 2D graphics in 1536p resolution!!, and it will be available for PC, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android. Hopefully if we reach an extra goal it will be on GameStick and OUYA too.</p>

We're launching this campaign to help turn Caribbean Island: A Pirate Adventure into an awesome game that will be bigger and more ambitious than anything we've ever made to date!
 

Caribbean Island: A Pirate Adventure is a point-and-click adventure game in the old-school style titles. We’re creating an epic, fun and challenging new adventure.
The game focuses on the story of Oliver.Oliver is an eccentric pirate seeking treasures.And survives mostly by using wit and negotiation rather than weapons or force.Our hero will arrive to an island and the only way to start the adventure is with your help.
The initial plan is to have 4 chapters on the game. If we reach extra goals we can add a 5th and 6th chapter.We hope to have the game done in around mid 2014.
With your help, Caribbean Island will become a reality—forged by Voon in 2D graphics in 1536p resolution!!, and it will be available for PC, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android. Hopefully if we reach an extra goal it will be on GameStick and OUYA too.
 

 Please, vote for us on Steam Greenlight!
 
Update 1: We are also going to bring a pixelated version so you can choose to play on full HD graphics or old-style pixel art (you can change it at anytime of the game).

<h3>Hey there dice rollers!</h3>
<p>After a regroup and a bunch of improvements we are back in business with our portable 6x4 handy dandy play surface.</p>
<p><i>""you mean a folding table right?""</i></p>
<p>Well yes and no.  It is a quad folding table built rugged and big enough for you not to have to bring any additional tables or surface doodads to play a game.  It's 30lbs, folds into its own carry box, and takes less than 2 minutes to set--up or take down.  There are many 6 foot tables out there, believe us we have probably looked at most of them, but none have the specs we are offering with the ALPHA.</p>
<p><i>""so... I already have a table...""</i></p>
<p>Hey good for you Champ, we do too.  What about the folks that don’t?  But what happens if you need an additional table space because the friends and beers have multiplied in numbers at the gathering?  Maybe you're tired of hosting at your place because you're the only one in the group that has a table?  Perhaps rolling dice in 3 layers of clothing isn't as much fun anymore because the only place your spouse will let you have a giant 24 square foot table is the basement, garage, or attic?  Or perhaps you've always been curious how it feels to roll dice with one hand while flipping burgers with the other (we mean outside).  Then the ALPHA may be for you!</p>
<p>So that's what the ALPHA Game Table brings to you.  A play surface when you need it, and a convenient storage or stowage case when you don't.  Slip it under your bed, in the car, or hide it behind a cat... no wait, a couch.  We designed the ALPHA so we could enjoy our hobby ANYWHERE.  And now you can too...</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477675895/gxzfl8cnzhlmnsssnq5d.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h3>Firmer Terra LLC</h3>
<p>We are businessmen who enjoy miniatures war games.  We started Firmer Terra LLC to help bring some much needed solutions to problems that we face with this hobby.  Finding a play space for various miniatures games has always been an issue.  Most of these games require 24 or 16 square feet of flat real estate.  Most tables do not have the proper width so we have to improvise by cutting the play space short or building some bulky surface that ends up in the basement or garage.</p>
<p>We researched various table manufacturers and selected the best fit for a relationship based on quality, price, and experience.  After introducing our table requirement we spent months engineering, and re-engineering, the various changes necessary to have a unit of this size.  This included structural modifications, color schemes, dimensional adjustments, frame changes, and stress tolerances.  In the end we had a prototype of a surface unit that was unique to our company.</p>
<p>We hope to deliver a product based on three core concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>PORTABLE- the table has to be lightweight (about 30lbs), it has to be able to fold and store in a convenient manner either in a car trunk or under a bed.  Average set-up or take-down takes less than 2 minutes.</li>
<li>VERSATILE- the table has to be able to accommodate most miniatures tabletop games and accessories.  That means the surface area has to be a minimum of 4 feet by 6 feet.</li>
<li>VALUE DRIVEN- the price point has to be reasonable.  Our standard was that the table would cost less than the average army of miniatures or the terrain.  As part of this campaign we are offering the ALPHA at $130.00 plus shipping. </li>
</ul>
<p>In the end we had the ALPHA Game Table.  A surface that you can feel free to set-up in any room, and when you're done playing just fold up and stow away. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477676127/yj5da7khdexxrvu0r2yx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>All of the photos you see are with full permission from our manufacturer.  The ALPHA in the set-up video is our only prototype and is unique to our design.  We need your support to make this happen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So we have completed the design phase of the process.  We have a smaller sample unit that we put through rugged abuse testing.  What we need from the Indiegogo community is an initial understanding of the market along with the capital required for the first MOQ (minimum order quantity).  We have paid for the retooling and production set-up.  This was one of the greatest obstacles since creating a table of this dimension is not common for most manufacturing molds and special tooling was required.</p>
<p>Our campaign will run in two phases.  We have limited initial production line slated for delivery in December of 2016; and hopefully in time to get to your doorstep by the 20th of December.  Our overrun and additional manufacturing is scheduled to arrive in the first part of 2017.  We will avoid shipping (that is cargo ship) these units during December since freighters charge more for peak season, but more importantly since cargo has a higher chance of being damaged during these months in ports.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We started this project with one goal in mind, to have these tables and use them.  We can't order just a few units since factories produce in bulk.  So we decided to crowdfund our concept and let fellow gamers in on the idea.  Your support will help us make this a reality.  If everything goes according to plan backers will be waging war on these tables in time for the December holidays.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Intended Purpose and Instructions</h3>
<p>READ FIRST</p>
<p>With proper care this unit is designed to give you a comfortable game play surface for many years.  Please be sure to check out any further updates at firmerterra.com.  If you should require technical support please email<strong> info@firmerterra.com</strong></p>
<p>PLEASE INSPECT YOUR TABLE WHEN REMOVING PACKAGING MATERIALS.  AVOID USING KNIVES OR CUTTERS AROUND THE UNIT AS YOU CAN DAMAGE THE SURFACE.</p>
<p>SURFACE WEIGHT: The ALPHA Game Table was designed to support 45 Kilo, or 100 lbs, of surface weight dispersed throughout its area, and any 2 x 2 inch area to support at least 2 lbs.  We recommend testing the stability of the unit if you plan on adding more weight (we do not recommend exceeding weight specs).</p>
<p>The table is intended for its original use as a play surface for tabletop games.  Do not sit or stand on the unit.  Always supervise children, pets, when engaging with the unit as excess weight concentrations may cause the unit to become unstable.  When not in use fold the table to storage mode.</p>
<p>STABILITY: The ALPHA Game Table is a lightweight play surface.  Test the stability of the table prior to leaning or jarring the unit.  Always make sure that the locking latches are engaged when the unit is being used as a surface or while in storage mode.  The unit performs best on flat solid ground (hard floors), always test the stability before playing.</p>
<p>SET-UP: Follow the set-up video on firmerterra.com for any instruction.  The table is designed to set-up and take down in less than 2 minutes.  <strong>When flipping the unit to change modes be sure to hold securely at each shorter end with a partner.</strong>  Attempting to flip this large surface space by yourself may result in damage to the hinges or structure.  Make sure to be clear of all hinges when changing modes.</p>
<p>SURFACE: The surface of the table is designed of water resistant MDF and aluminum.  If the table becomes wet use a cloth to absorb moisture.  The table is rated for outdoor use, but prolonged exposure to sunlight or moisture may damage the unit.  The surface may become scratched if not properly handled.  Most scratches will not impact the functionality of the unit.  For more information go to firmerterra.com.  Avoid exposing the surface to hot containers.  Avoid exposing the surface to high energy impact.</p>
<p>Discard all packaging material properly and keep away from children.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid dragging the table when in play mode.  Ask someone to help you lift the unit and move it.</strong></p>
<p>When in storage mode, be mindful of the table edges and surface.  Make certain that the table has been properly converted in each mode and that the joints and surface edges line up properly.  Avoid forcing the table during mode changes.  All joints should move freely and allow for easily mode change.</p>
<p><strong>Avoid blaming poor dice rolls on the table as subsurface emotional damage may result.</strong></p>
<p>Be mindful where you play.  Avoid high traffic paths as you are going to block 24 square feet of space. </p>
<p>The user(s) assume all liability when using this unit.  Exercise common sense at all times.  Be mindful of the fact that this is a lightweight structure.  Avoid dangerous environments when playing a game.</p>
<p><u>In other words</u></p>
<p>We do not recommend, advise, or ever encourage sitting, bracing, or (for the love of...) laying on top of this gaming surface.  The ALPHA is intended as a gaming surface strictly.  Please never stand on it, or use it as a recliner, a pool diving board, a bridge, or hoist it above your head in a fit of victory.  Always exercise caution and respect for what this game surface is and its original intent; to enjoy miniatures games and similar hobbies.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Any product that is manufactured abroad has inherent risk of failure. This is why we have created a relationship with a proven manufacturer and a domestic customs receiver.<br/>Price of raw materials can fluctuate, although we do not predict any dramatic impacts on the types of materials we are using.  Upon receiving these units we will evaluate random packages for shipping damage, coherency to specs, and overall play-ability.<br/>Table wobble is inherent with any lightweight piece of furniture. You can't stand on this table or smash it in a fit of dice roll rage. A redesign of the original prototype proved that independently braced legs help absorb wobble. Our test group had no issues with this. Besides, most gamers stand around their tables rather than sit by them.  We have played dozens of games on the prototype and found no issue with this.<br/>We have over 30 years of business building experience (over half of that in foreign work). We have been building businesses out of ideas for over 2 decades. Although the video may not be uber professional we wanted to pass along the savings to our backers.<br/><strong>The ALPHA Game table has been evaluated, test run, and is now in the initial phase of manufacture. </strong> We are offering these units in limited production run as a test of the market and a step in beginning full manufacture.  A secondary production run will commence as soon as the initial units arrive.  If everything goes according to schedule these finished units should be entering the US by December of 2016.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you like the idea, but can't contribute, then we would appreciate it if you spread the word.  Tell your gaming friends.  You may know a miniatures enthusiast who is going off to college and would appreciate a surface that can easily stow under a seat.  Or perhaps you're already in a house and people just can't appreciate a, permanent, giant table in the middle of a room.  Fold away when you're done.  The entire process takes less than 2 minutes.</p>
<p>If you're into miniatures games and are tired of going to other people's homes to play then this is worth your attention.</p>
<p>If you're into miniatures and are tired of always hosting the game because you're the only one with a surface then this is worth your attention.</p>
<p>If you enjoy owning large portable surfaces, and you've never played miniatures war games, then this is worth your attention.</p>
<p>You get the idea....</p>

Well yes and no.  It is a quad folding table built rugged and big enough for you not to have to bring any additional tables or surface doodads to play a game.  It's 30lbs, folds into its own carry box, and takes less than 2 minutes to set--up or take down.  There are many 6 foot tables out there, believe us we have probably looked at most of them, but none have the specs we are offering with the ALPHA.
""so... I already have a table...""
Hey good for you Champ, we do too.  What about the folks that don’t?  But what happens if you need an additional table space because the friends and beers have multiplied in numbers at the gathering?  Maybe you're tired of hosting at your place because you're the only one in the group that has a table?  Perhaps rolling dice in 3 layers of clothing isn't as much fun anymore because the only place your spouse will let you have a giant 24 square foot table is the basement, garage, or attic?  Or perhaps you've always been curious how it feels to roll dice with one hand while flipping burgers with the other (we mean outside).  Then the ALPHA may be for you!
So that's what the ALPHA Game Table brings to you.  A play surface when you need it, and a convenient storage or stowage case when you don't.  Slip it under your bed, in the car, or hide it behind a cat... no wait, a couch.  We designed the ALPHA so we could enjoy our hobby ANYWHERE.  And now you can too...
 

Firmer Terra LLC
We are businessmen who enjoy miniatures war games.  We started Firmer Terra LLC to help bring some much needed solutions to problems that we face with this hobby.  Finding a play space for various miniatures games has always been an issue.  Most of these games require 24 or 16 square feet of flat real estate.  Most tables do not have the proper width so we have to improvise by cutting the play space short or building some bulky surface that ends up in the basement or garage.
We researched various table manufacturers and selected the best fit for a relationship based on quality, price, and experience.  After introducing our table requirement we spent months engineering, and re-engineering, the various changes necessary to have a unit of this size.  This included structural modifications, color schemes, dimensional adjustments, frame changes, and stress tolerances.  In the end we had a prototype of a surface unit that was unique to our company.
We hope to deliver a product based on three core concepts:

PORTABLE- the table has to be lightweight (about 30lbs), it has to be able to fold and store in a convenient manner either in a car trunk or under a bed.  Average set-up or take-down takes less than 2 minutes.
VERSATILE- the table has to be able to accommodate most miniatures tabletop games and accessories.  That means the surface area has to be a minimum of 4 feet by 6 feet.
VALUE DRIVEN- the price point has to be reasonable.  Our standard was that the table would cost less than the average army of miniatures or the terrain.  As part of this campaign we are offering the ALPHA at $130.00 plus shipping. 

In the end we had the ALPHA Game Table.  A surface that you can feel free to set-up in any room, and when you're done playing just fold up and stow away. 

All of the photos you see are with full permission from our manufacturer.  The ALPHA in the set-up video is our only prototype and is unique to our design.  We need your support to make this happen.

What We Need & What You Get
So we have completed the design phase of the process.  We have a smaller sample unit that we put through rugged abuse testing.  What we need from the Indiegogo community is an initial understanding of the market along with the capital required for the first MOQ (minimum order quantity).  We have paid for the retooling and production set-up.  This was one of the greatest obstacles since creating a table of this dimension is not common for most manufacturing molds and special tooling was required.
Our campaign will run in two phases.  We have limited initial production line slated for delivery in December of 2016; and hopefully in time to get to your doorstep by the 20th of December.  Our overrun and additional manufacturing is scheduled to arrive in the first part of 2017.  We will avoid shipping (that is cargo ship) these units during December since freighters charge more for peak season, but more importantly since cargo has a higher chance of being damaged during these months in ports.

The Impact
We started this project with one goal in mind, to have these tables and use them.  We can't order just a few units since factories produce in bulk.  So we decided to crowdfund our concept and let fellow gamers in on the idea.  Your support will help us make this a reality.  If everything goes according to plan backers will be waging war on these tables in time for the December holidays.

Intended Purpose and Instructions
READ FIRST
With proper care this unit is designed to give you a comfortable game play surface for many years.  Please be sure to check out any further updates at firmerterra.com.  If you should require technical support please email info@firmerterra.com
PLEASE INSPECT YOUR TABLE WHEN REMOVING PACKAGING MATERIALS.  AVOID USING KNIVES OR CUTTERS AROUND THE UNIT AS YOU CAN DAMAGE THE SURFACE.
SURFACE WEIGHT: The ALPHA Game Table was designed to support 45 Kilo, or 100 lbs, of surface weight dispersed throughout its area, and any 2 x 2 inch area to support at least 2 lbs.  We recommend testing the stability of the unit if you plan on adding more weight (we do not recommend exceeding weight specs).
The table is intended for its original use as a play surface for tabletop games.  Do not sit or stand on the unit.  Always supervise children, pets, when engaging with the unit as excess weight concentrations may cause the unit to become unstable.  When not in use fold the table to storage mode.
STABILITY: The ALPHA Game Table is a lightweight play surface.  Test the stability of the table prior to leaning or jarring the unit.  Always make sure that the locking latches are engaged when the unit is being used as a surface or while in storage mode.  The unit performs best on flat solid ground (hard floors), always test the stability before playing.
SET-UP: Follow the set-up video on firmerterra.com for any instruction.  The table is designed to set-up and take down in less than 2 minutes.  When flipping the unit to change modes be sure to hold securely at each shorter end with a partner.  Attempting to flip this large surface space by yourself may result in damage to the hinges or structure.  Make sure to be clear of all hinges when changing modes.
SURFACE: The surface of the table is designed of water resistant MDF and aluminum.  If the table becomes wet use a cloth to absorb moisture.  The table is rated for outdoor use, but prolonged exposure to sunlight or moisture may damage the unit.  The surface may become scratched if not properly handled.  Most scratches will not impact the functionality of the unit.  For more information go to firmerterra.com.  Avoid exposing the surface to hot containers.  Avoid exposing the surface to high energy impact.
Discard all packaging material properly and keep away from children.
Avoid dragging the table when in play mode.  Ask someone to help you lift the unit and move it.
When in storage mode, be mindful of the table edges and surface.  Make certain that the table has been properly converted in each mode and that the joints and surface edges line up properly.  Avoid forcing the table during mode changes.  All joints should move freely and allow for easily mode change.
Avoid blaming poor dice rolls on the table as subsurface emotional damage may result.
Be mindful where you play.  Avoid high traffic paths as you are going to block 24 square feet of space. 
The user(s) assume all liability when using this unit.  Exercise common sense at all times.  Be mindful of the fact that this is a lightweight structure.  Avoid dangerous environments when playing a game.
In other words
We do not recommend, advise, or ever encourage sitting, bracing, or (for the love of...) laying on top of this gaming surface.  The ALPHA is intended as a gaming surface strictly.  Please never stand on it, or use it as a recliner, a pool diving board, a bridge, or hoist it above your head in a fit of victory.  Always exercise caution and respect for what this game surface is and its original intent; to enjoy miniatures games and similar hobbies.
Risks & Challenges
Any product that is manufactured abroad has inherent risk of failure. This is why we have created a relationship with a proven manufacturer and a domestic customs receiver.Price of raw materials can fluctuate, although we do not predict any dramatic impacts on the types of materials we are using.  Upon receiving these units we will evaluate random packages for shipping damage, coherency to specs, and overall play-ability.Table wobble is inherent with any lightweight piece of furniture. You can't stand on this table or smash it in a fit of dice roll rage. A redesign of the original prototype proved that independently braced legs help absorb wobble. Our test group had no issues with this. Besides, most gamers stand around their tables rather than sit by them.  We have played dozens of games on the prototype and found no issue with this.We have over 30 years of business building experience (over half of that in foreign work). We have been building businesses out of ideas for over 2 decades. Although the video may not be uber professional we wanted to pass along the savings to our backers.The ALPHA Game table has been evaluated, test run, and is now in the initial phase of manufacture.  We are offering these units in limited production run as a test of the market and a step in beginning full manufacture.  A secondary production run will commence as soon as the initial units arrive.  If everything goes according to schedule these finished units should be entering the US by December of 2016.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you like the idea, but can't contribute, then we would appreciate it if you spread the word.  Tell your gaming friends.  You may know a miniatures enthusiast who is going off to college and would appreciate a surface that can easily stow under a seat.  Or perhaps you're already in a house and people just can't appreciate a, permanent, giant table in the middle of a room.  Fold away when you're done.  The entire process takes less than 2 minutes.
If you're into miniatures games and are tired of going to other people's homes to play then this is worth your attention.
If you're into miniatures and are tired of always hosting the game because you're the only one with a surface then this is worth your attention.
If you enjoy owning large portable surfaces, and you've never played miniatures war games, then this is worth your attention.

<strong style=""font-weight: bold;""><strong>A:</strong> </strong>Yes, VicoVR as a Bluetooth peripheral can be paired with any Bluetooth compatible devices such as AppleTV, AndroidTV, or Android PC. Kinect-like body tracking capability of VicoVR Sensor can be used in new generation of Mobile OS - based applications beyond VR, such as TV gaming, medical, security, or smart home applications.</div>
<div>
<br/><strong style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: Does Vico VR detect the physics (i.e. mass, gravity, and speed) of the gesture? For example, when playing Moon Bird, if I wave my hands faster &amp; harder, will the bird fly higher? </strong>
</div>
<div>
<strong style=""font-weight: bold;"">A:</strong><b> </b>Sure, VicoVR enables to take physics of body gesture (mass, gravity, and speed) into account, but it is defined on application level, not in VicoVR itself. VicoVR communicates in real time (currently at 30 fps) 3D positional data of 19 body joints of human body. And then Android app developer, using VicoVR plugin with his favorite game engine (unity3D, UE4), sets the physics rules inside his app</div>
<div>
<br/><strong style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: I want to scan my room, can VicoVR do 3D scanning?</strong>
</div>
<div>
<strong style=""font-weight: bold;"">A: </strong>This is perfect application for VicoVR but this feature will not be supported in the current version of VicoVR (we also not provide access to raw depth map to third party developers). But we are working on adding new features and capabilities including 3D scan capability. Adding new features to VicoVR in the future can be done easily by means of software upgrades.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<strong>Q: </strong><strong>If you turn off the lights, can VicoVR still sense you?</strong>
</div>
<div>
<b>A:</b> Yes, it can.<br/><strong><br/><br/>Q: </strong><strong>How does VicoVR use the RGB camera?</strong>
</div>
<div>
<b>A: </b>VicoVR has RGB camera as part of its depth sensing module, but it is not used in the current version. We reserve it for future applications of VicoVR, such as 3D scanning, live 3D holograms and the like. These features can be enabled in the future with VicoVR firmware updates using <em>existing</em> VicoVR hardware. <br/><br/><strong>Q: If my game/app is higher than 30 FPS will it delay, operate too quickly, and/or cause motion sickness?</strong>
</div>
<div>
<strong>A: </strong>For good user experience in VR, the game should operate at least at 60 fps. VicoVR refresh rate is currently 30 fps, resulting in some latency on the part of body tracking and HMD positional tracking. As for latency of HMD orientation tracking, which we believe is the major source of motion sickness, it is defined not by VicoVR but by quality of IMU sensors of HMD. <br/>
</div>
<br/><p><b>Q: Can I play popular VR games currently on the market using my VicoVR gaming system? </b></p>
<p><b>A: </b>Firstly, we work with Mobile HMDs only. Secondly, developers need to use our free SDK to add body control and to make the game VicoVR-compatible. Games can be:</p>
<p>1. New and developed only for VicoVR </p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>2. Already existing Android games <br/></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Q: What controllers are compatible with VicoVR?</b></span><br/></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Developers are free to use any extra controller of their choice with VicoVR SDK.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Q:</b> <strong>Does Vico VR detect finger movement?</strong></p>
<p><b>A: </b>We do not track individual fingers. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>Q: Does Vico VR support Voice Recognition? </strong></p>
<p><strong><strong>A:</strong> </strong>No, this feature is not supported and we have no plans for enabling it in the future. We think that your Mobile HMD is better suited to handle any voice recognition tasks.<br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>Q: Does VicoVR have physics implementation for hands and feet?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> While we have samples of body models as part of SDK, all Android VR developers are free to use any other models they like.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>Q: Does VicoVR track both position and orientation of HMD?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>No, VicoVR just tracks position of Mobile HMD by approximating body tracking data. Orientation of HMD is tracked by Mobile HMD itself with no influence from VicoVR. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>Q: Does VicoVR work well with bracelets, watches, sleeves, etc?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> VicoVR uses high quality IR based depth sensing module for tracking body. But, as usual in computer vision, we cannot guarantee fault free performance under any circumstances, especially with materials non reflecting IR (such as some types of fabric, watches, bracelets, etc). <br/><br/></p>
<p><strong>Q: Does VicoVR work outdoors?</strong><br/><strong>A:</strong> Current version of VicoVR uses IR based depth sensing module and it means VicoVR cannot work outdoor or indoor with a direct sunlight.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>Q: What data is sent from VicoVR to the Mobile Headset?<br/>A</strong>: <span style=""background-color: initial;"">VicoVR processes depth input and wirellessly outputs to Android or iOS headset:</span>
</p>
<ul>
<li>User pixel masks, unlimited @ 30 fps</li>
<li>3D coordinates of upto 19 skeletal joints for user, two users max @ 30 fps</li>
<li>3D Point Cloud @ 30 fps, upto 160*120</li>
<li>Hand pointers (3D), Gestures (fist open/closed, swipes).</li>
</ul>
<p>All processing is done inside sensor, completely off-loading CPU of Android/iOS Headset!</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
<strong>Q: I know that depth map based tracking cannot provide submillimeter accuracy of tracking - how accurate is your HMD's positional tracking?<br/>A</strong>: Yes, 3D position tracking of HMD is based on just one head joint and cannot provide a comfortable experience because of some jitter. However, by having data of all other body joints apart from head, and taking into consideration body kinematics, there is an opportunity to significantly reduce jitter in headset location. We're constantly working to improve perceived accuracy of headset tracking, and those improvements will be available via firmware updates, without the need to replace sensor hardware. <p><strong style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong style=""background-color: initial;"">Q: What is the Warranty? </strong><br/></p>

Q: I'm an Android VR Developer, can I get the VicoVR Devkit now?A: Yes! We have a Developer Program where qualified developers can get immediate access to VicoVR devkit prototypes and SDK. To request devkit prototype please fill form at www.vicovr.com/developers. Q: Can VicoVR be used with Oculus or HTC Vive?


A: VicoVR was designed with primary focus on Mobile VR headsets (Android, iOS) and in its current version cannot connect to Windows PC. But this feature may be added later by means of firmware updates, without the need to replace sensor hardware. Q: What's the range of the Tracking area?


A: Tracking range is between 0.5 - 4.5 meters and is limited by the Field of View of Sensor which is 60 degrees (horiz.).Q: Is any option to try VicoVR before purchase?


A: Yes! We are based in San Francisco and demo at all major VR events and meetups in the area and across US. Please follow us on social networks to learn our event schedule! If you are in the Bay Area, feel free to reach to info@vicovr.com to schedule an appointment.Q: Who develops application for VicoVR Sensor?


A: Despite VicoVR is the new platform, we already having several Android developers creating applications and demos for VicoVR. When VicoVR is available later in 2016, apps for VicoVR Sensor will be available on Google Play, AppStore, or on Oculus Gear VR Store.Q: I am an Android VR Developer, can I get VicoVR Devkit now?


A: Yes! We have Developer Program where qualified developers can get immediate access to VicoVR devkit and SDK. To join VicoVR Developer Program please visit our website. Currently over twenty Android developers already joined our developer program. VicoVR is attractive to Mobile game developers because our Unity3D/UE4 plugins allow them opportunity to quickly add full body control to their existing Android or iOS apps.Q: Do you provide SDK?


A: Yes, we provide plugins for Unity3D, UE4 and C++ API.Q: Is PC required?


A: No PC is required. You need VicoVR Sensor and any Bluetooth enabled host device such as Android HMD, AppleTV, Android TV, or Android game console.Q: Can it be paired with iOS devices?


A: Yes, consumer version of VicoVR can be paired with iOS devices. Q: Can VicoVR be used in non- VR applications?


A: Yes, VicoVR as a Bluetooth peripheral can be paired with any Bluetooth compatible devices such as AppleTV, AndroidTV, or Android PC. Kinect-like body tracking capability of VicoVR Sensor can be used in new generation of Mobile OS - based applications beyond VR, such as TV gaming, medical, security, or smart home applications.

Q: Does Vico VR detect the physics (i.e. mass, gravity, and speed) of the gesture? For example, when playing Moon Bird, if I wave my hands faster & harder, will the bird fly higher? 


A: Sure, VicoVR enables to take physics of body gesture (mass, gravity, and speed) into account, but it is defined on application level, not in VicoVR itself. VicoVR communicates in real time (currently at 30 fps) 3D positional data of 19 body joints of human body. And then Android app developer, using VicoVR plugin with his favorite game engine (unity3D, UE4), sets the physics rules inside his app

Q: I want to scan my room, can VicoVR do 3D scanning?


A: This is perfect application for VicoVR but this feature will not be supported in the current version of VicoVR (we also not provide access to raw depth map to third party developers). But we are working on adding new features and capabilities including 3D scan capability. Adding new features to VicoVR in the future can be done easily by means of software upgrades.


Q: If you turn off the lights, can VicoVR still sense you?


A: Yes, it can.Q: How does VicoVR use the RGB camera?


A: VicoVR has RGB camera as part of its depth sensing module, but it is not used in the current version. We reserve it for future applications of VicoVR, such as 3D scanning, live 3D holograms and the like. These features can be enabled in the future with VicoVR firmware updates using existing VicoVR hardware. Q: If my game/app is higher than 30 FPS will it delay, operate too quickly, and/or cause motion sickness?


A: For good user experience in VR, the game should operate at least at 60 fps. VicoVR refresh rate is currently 30 fps, resulting in some latency on the part of body tracking and HMD positional tracking. As for latency of HMD orientation tracking, which we believe is the major source of motion sickness, it is defined not by VicoVR but by quality of IMU sensors of HMD. 

Q: Can I play popular VR games currently on the market using my VicoVR gaming system? 
A: Firstly, we work with Mobile HMDs only. Secondly, developers need to use our free SDK to add body control and to make the game VicoVR-compatible. Games can be:
1. New and developed only for VicoVR 
OR
2. Already existing Android games 

Q: What controllers are compatible with VicoVR?
A: Developers are free to use any extra controller of their choice with VicoVR SDK.

Q: Does Vico VR detect finger movement?
A: We do not track individual fingers. 

Q: Does Vico VR support Voice Recognition? 
A: No, this feature is not supported and we have no plans for enabling it in the future. We think that your Mobile HMD is better suited to handle any voice recognition tasks.
Q: Does VicoVR have physics implementation for hands and feet?
A: While we have samples of body models as part of SDK, all Android VR developers are free to use any other models they like.

Q: Does VicoVR track both position and orientation of HMD?
A: No, VicoVR just tracks position of Mobile HMD by approximating body tracking data. Orientation of HMD is tracked by Mobile HMD itself with no influence from VicoVR. 

Q: Does VicoVR work well with bracelets, watches, sleeves, etc?
A: VicoVR uses high quality IR based depth sensing module for tracking body. But, as usual in computer vision, we cannot guarantee fault free performance under any circumstances, especially with materials non reflecting IR (such as some types of fabric, watches, bracelets, etc). 
Q: Does VicoVR work outdoors?A: Current version of VicoVR uses IR based depth sensing module and it means VicoVR cannot work outdoor or indoor with a direct sunlight.

Q: What data is sent from VicoVR to the Mobile Headset?A: VicoVR processes depth input and wirellessly outputs to Android or iOS headset:


User pixel masks, unlimited @ 30 fps
3D coordinates of upto 19 skeletal joints for user, two users max @ 30 fps
3D Point Cloud @ 30 fps, upto 160*120
Hand pointers (3D), Gestures (fist open/closed, swipes).

All processing is done inside sensor, completely off-loading CPU of Android/iOS Headset!

Q: I know that depth map based tracking cannot provide submillimeter accuracy of tracking - how accurate is your HMD's positional tracking?A: Yes, 3D position tracking of HMD is based on just one head joint and cannot provide a comfortable experience because of some jitter. However, by having data of all other body joints apart from head, and taking into consideration body kinematics, there is an opportunity to significantly reduce jitter in headset location. We're constantly working to improve perceived accuracy of headset tracking, and those improvements will be available via firmware updates, without the need to replace sensor hardware. 
Q: What is the Warranty? 
A: We provide a one (1) year limited warranty. We guarantee you receive your VicoVR Sensor free of manufacturing defects.Q: Can I change or cancel my perk?
A: Indiegogo has now made it easier than ever to upgrade your perks. You can now do so on the contributions tab of your Indiegogo profile.

Would you like to venture into the atmosphere of 1970s/80s/90s?
Remind what was the envy of every preschooler/schoolboy/schoolgirl?
Once again feel the delicious taste of turbo gum, ulker final or cin cin football?
The doors are open to everyone with a hint of nostalgia in his heart and desire to rack one`s brain.
You do not only crawl through rooms and exhibits just like that. No, it would be boring.
Do you want to hear the stories of bubble gum pictures? comic books? electronic games?
Do you want to strain your mind to the limits at the same time?
Our curator - Muko - the hamster - will guide you willingly, but he will not lead you by hand. He will tell some stories about one exhibit or another and ... ups, he disappeared again in the maze.You are all alone now and you have to earn the next story.

FAQ
 I am a collector - I am collecting stuff for ages - I have no clue whether it`s already a disease or still the hobby - but somehow I manage for now.Years passing away quicker and quicker so I decided to fulfill my dreams that remind me of my childhood.The first dream was to release a new book from a forgotten collection ""Album for collectors"" - SUCCEEDED 
 
(btw. I got so engaged that the next one will be prepared at the end of 2016)The next dream was to set a new Guinness World Record - my category - largest collection of chewing gum packets (pictures/stickers/tattoos) - SUCCEEDED.
  
Current dream on the list is to make computer game with my children. I wouldn`t be myself if I did not push here something connected to my hobby - collectingThere is also one final dream on the list - currently postponed for the future - I would like to open a real museum of collections where you could go back in time to XX century, play some old arcades, flipper games take a look into chewing gum pictures, comic books or collections of stamps.I hope I will succeed some day.   
Would you like to catch a glimpse of collectibles from 70s/80s/90s?
Would you like to go back to years when pictures from TURBO gum were official currency replacement in school, stickers from KOUKOU ROUKOU wafers were present on every pupils` notebook and hand held consoles meant NU PAGADI?
Would you like to rack your brain a bit in extremely difficult 2, 3 and 4 dimensional mazes?
Would you like to have your own contribution to the final look of the game? graphics? maybe an ending?
Maybe thanks to this game you will eventually start collecting something on your own :)
And maybe thanks to you I will manage to open sometime in the future first in the world museum of bubble gum packets? (in the real world - not the virtual one)? You can enjoy the foretaste of the museum now in Poland - mini-collection of TURBO gum pictures in a cafe in Warsaw.

 
  

Maze for everyone - from 4 to 99+

First (I hope) in the world playable museum sightseeing
Extremely difficult game with 2, 3 and 4 dimensional mazes


Great graphics :) prepared with help of 6, 3 and 0-year old directors (and maybe you!!)

Tons of knowledge about collections from 70s/80s/90s
No micropayments
  
Most part of the engine

Part of graphics

Intro

Team - three graphics/sfx directors and me (developer)
PrePre-alpha - version of game

Screens of this masterpiece below
         Whatever happens I will finish this game. With your help the game can be much better. I know that apart from that I am outstanding ;) game developer, graphic designer and animation and music creator, I accept with humility that there are better pros. Thanks to your help I could pay professionals that could help make this game much better. In the first place it would be worth: 

Improve the Intro and game graphics

Refine sound and music

Make ports to android, ios, ...
Finish levels
Finish and optimize the engine

Buy needed licenses

Improve whatever I do not see but you and ""band of scoffers"" will notice
 Choose perk for yourself and support this project!I have prepared 3 groups of perks - so that everyone can find something for themselves.

<h3>Em-8ER - A Massive Battle Fought Online</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497479561/vdyado5i2zyr7me9w8fp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Em-8ER is played online, in a persistent open world where players must conquer and terraform new territory and wage a huge war against an aggressive shape-shifting group of aliens and monstrous creatures. While there is nothing quite like Em-8ER, we've been influenced by games/films/anime such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Planetside 2 </strong>- Massive open world wars, but ours are PvE.</li>
<li>
<strong>Firefall </strong>- Jetpacks, gliding and thumping. Fast movement.</li>
<li>
<strong>Starcraft</strong> - RTS base building (We worked on this game too)</li>
<li>
<strong>Pacific Rim </strong>- Kaiju! Giant monster battles!</li>
<li>
<strong>Attack on Titan </strong>- Fast, agile humans with vertical combat vs giants.</li>
<li>
<strong>Xenoblade Chronicles</strong> - Mecha! But ours are smaller, more like exosuits.</li>
</ul>
<p>Em-8ER offers a a blend taken from a little bit of each of these inspirations, and more. Our experience with delivering large scale worlds like World of Warcraft and Firefall mean we are in a unique position to deliver on this vision.</p>
<h3>Furious Mech vs Monster Combat</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497479622/xbasbz3hhuceviwyreqt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Pilot MEK suits called ""omniframes"" in fast paced gunplay and brutal melee combat. Grapple with the Tsi-Hu in their dangerous, bladed beast forms and use finisher moves to eliminate your enemies. Craft and collect multiple omniframes, load them out with your own weapons and abilities, and make your combat style truly unique. Jet up, skim the terrain, and glide over landscapes in nimble combat maneuvers.</p>
<h3>Craft Everything, Build Bases</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497479652/pehh8nhknrvnnf1ktldg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Mine precious resources with giant autonomous drill-mechs known as MEK/A. Use those resources to craft everything in the game from weapons and abilities, to establishing and upgrading huge military bases. Research tech trees to unlock higher tiers of crafting and join with other players to pool resources to build bigger and better fortifications and upgrades for bases</p>
<h3>Terraform the World</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497479677/xdojrcjpmepiok5spu6b.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Conquer new zones and terraform them by establishing bases and deploying giant atmospheric machines that churn the atmosphere and gradually alter the landscape into lush biomes. The more you terraform the world, the more unique resources and crafting tiers are unlocked. Players must all work together in a huge group effort to advance the state of the world and defend it from destructive invasion by the Tsi-Hu and their giant monsters.</p>
<h3>Giant Kaiju Monster Battles</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497479771/woh1z4io3l4fdajhxgkg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Tsi-Hu enslave and use giant, tech-augmented monsters called kaiju as their siege weapons. The Tsi-Hu have blended their technology with the beasts, augmenting them to control them and equip them with advanced weapons and shield generators. These giant beasts rip through bases and can lay waste to entire zones. Players must band together to bring them down.</p>
<h3>Immediate Rewards for New Backers!</h3>
<p>In addition to this fundraiser's new goals of characters, weapons, and shooting mechanics, and the eventual playable mockup, ALL new backers will receive immediate rewards.</p>
<p>New backers will receive (at the close of this campaign), the PDF design vision book (with 20 pages of lore, game design and illustrations), as well as the downloadable first build of the game: the THMPR Art Demo made with Unreal Engine 4.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497478187/ywjnlddargb6yrd7yr7f.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The unreal test dummy is temporary. The THMPR and landscape are original. As a eligible backer, you will be emailed a download link to this current exe art demo as soon as the campaign ends.</p>

<h3>World Class Experienced Team</h3>
<p>If you are new to Em-8ER, welcome! My name is Mark Kern, and I create worlds with my fantastic teams. I lead the creation of World of Warcraft at Blizzard (team lead on vanilla) and also helped lead the petition with Nostalrius to bring back legacy servers on WoW. Em-8ER is the game I've always wanted to make: an online game where hundreds of players wage a persistent war in an openworld shooter against a ruthless enemy AI!</p>

<h3>Working Pilots, Geesuits in MEKs!</h3>
<p>At the successful completion of this milestone, you will be able to climb into your omniframe MEK with your choice of male or female pilot in their sleek geesuits (pilot suits). Glide, skim and jet over 1/2 sq kilometers of terrain. Then deploy your omniframe's weapon systems. and start shooting! We'll provide plenty of static targets for you to practice on while we wait on the Tsi-Hu shape-shifting enemy milestone!</p>

<p><i>The male and female zBrush sculpts are complete, but we need to finish their textures, low-poly LODs and get them into the game with finely rendered hair. Backing the milestone will help go towards compensating the artist for what they have already done and finish the last steps.</i></p>

<h3>Guns!</h3>
<p>This milestone we are creating the art pipeline for our modular gun system. Everything is crafted in Em-8ER and you can choose what weapons you want to equip as loadouts on your omniframe. The milestone will feature at least one gun and basic shooting mechanics at static targets. But the art pipeline should allow a small team like our to create the looks we need to support a variety of crafting weapons.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Milestones? What are those?</h3>
<p>Em-8ER takes a unique approach to crowd-funding and building a community around the game. We recognize there is a lot of skepticism and worry about funding games on sites like IndieGoGo. We wanted to build trust, momentum and community to address that. Instead of asking for hundreds of thousands up front and never delivering until alpha or beta, we create smaller milestones instead:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497556977/egwb4zvuuqv02fmdm1qs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Milestones are short, achievable steps and goals for the game. The community can inspect each milestone and determine if they want to see it continue by funding, or encouraging their friends to fund the next. This grows the audience and community for the game as we build trust and deliver results. So far we have successfully funded and delivered 2 milestones for Em-8ER at 460-600% of our original goals and grown to nearly 10,000 community members. It appears to be working!</p>
<p>This has benefits for us, the developers, too. First, we don't end up building a game where there is not enough demand or community. Second, we also avoid wandering off course or into feature creep as we have to keep very focused on these smaller goals. Finally, we get to grow an enthusiastic, excited community over time, not based on hype, but based on what they've actually played.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to have a couple of milestones to build our first playable mockup of the game. This is what devs call a ""vertical slice,"" which is taking the core elements of gameplay and fully rendering them to see how it looks/feels. This is used to ultimately approve full development of the project. Only, in this case, it is the community instead of a publisher who will be approving our playable mockup. We will hold a large fundraiser when we complete the mockup in order to start everyone on a full-time production schedule.</p>
<p>Becoming a backer gives you access to this milestone, its exclusive rewards, as well as the final playable mockup. We will be focusing on the frenetic combat feel of Em-8ER. The THMPR will drop down and start mining for resources while being attacked by waves of shape-shifting Tsi-Hu. Players must defend the THMPR to extract as many resources as possible while trading fire, using abilities, and jetting and gliding around the combat area.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Perks:</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497542894/bdjit6tveztwscf0slqj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li><p>All backers receive the last THMPR art build (in Unreal Engine) and PDF book</p></li>
<li><p>Deepscanner and above will receive this goals build as well as the FINAL game and playable prototype (if all milestones fully funded).</p></li>
<li><p>Deepscanner and above will receive the <strong>Character Omniframe/Shooting build</strong> as well as the upcoming Omniframe art build.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>3D printer files</strong> let you use a 3D printer to print parts for a bust of the THMPR mining MEK/A. Assembly required, but parts can be outsourced to places like <a href=""https://www.shapeways.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">shapeways.com</a></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Founder Omniframe skin</strong> is skin <strong>exclusive</strong> to this milestone. It will not be available any other milestone and will ship with the final game. This will be for each of the three frame sizes (light/med/heavy).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Founder THMPR emote pack</strong> will give your THMPR three extra emotes <strong>exclusive</strong> to this milestone and not found in others: /rude, /victory, and /conga. To be delivered in final game. /rude is just like the one removed from WoW and will never be removed from Em-8ER. /conga will chain THMPRs together in a conga line.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Name reservation and guild name reservation</strong> are new for this milestone. They will apply to final game ship.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Founder geesuits</strong> is also <strong>exclusive </strong>to this milestone and not available in any other milestone. Male and female variants included. Show off the fact that you were first to land on Em-8ER!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Deepstrike THMPR</strong> - This special skin is black with red accents and has a unique feature. Instead of dropping in by dropship, it teleports in with a unique effect. This is purely cosmetic and has no gameplay changes. It is also <strong>exclusive</strong> to this milestone and won't be offered again.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Custom Base Banners</strong> - These are black and white symbols that you get to design within our guidelines. They are displayed on large banners on the sides of the nexus buildings of bases you contribute to. The top 10 contributors of resources to a base have their banners displayed like a leaderboard on the sides of the nexus.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gold skins</strong> - Gold skins use our PBR advanced shaders in Unreal 4 to provide a real polished look.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Playable Mockup and Final Game multiples</strong> - At higher tiers, these will let you provide additional copies of either the playable mockup or final game to your friends. Contingent on all milestone funding. <i>They are not cumulative perk to perk (important!)</i></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Custom Gun Skin</strong> - Our highest perk. This allows you to design a gun from the library of parts we use to assemble them, and then design a custom skin to go over the parts. You may claim this reward later, as you play the game and determine which weapon type is your favorite.</p></li>
<li><p>Any entry marked as (final game) or including a prior perk with (final game) means this is only shipped if game is fully funded and completed and is not guaranteed.</p></li>
<li><p>Final Playable mockup is also contingent on all milestone goals being funded. We anticipate another 2-3 after this current one.</p></li>

<h3>A Special Offer for Firefall Veterans</h3>
<p>If you played the beta or early versions of Firefall, you might be familiar with some of the invasion, resource gathering, and crafting aspects that will be featured in Em-8ER.  Since Em-8ER is, in some ways, a spiritual successor to Firefall, we are extending a future virtual store credit towards Em-8ER for eligible Firefall veterans. Find out more on our <a href=""https://emberbot.jadex.eu/founders"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Firefall Credit Program website.</a></p> <h3>Why $20,000?</h3>
<p>The money raised for this milestone will be used towards the creation of a LOT of assets and functionality this milestone:</p>
<ul>
<li>Male &amp; Female playable characters</li>
<li>Characters functioning inside and piloting Omniframes</li>
<li>Gee-suits, clothing for the characters (concept &amp; modeling)</li>
<li>Animation of the characters</li>
<li>Weapon system concept and design. Modeling 1st gun</li>
<li>Basic Shooting mechanics (temporary targets)</li>
<li>Scripting &amp; Coding</li>
<li>Sound and visual effects</li>
</ul>
<p>We're raising more this round because of this, and because of features and speed. We want to be able to devote more hours and more team members to build a faster momentum behind game builds and deliverables. We also want to properly budget for animation, which we missed last milestone.</p>
<p>Finally, $20,000 is a good litmus test for us. Making an indie game of this scope, and targeting near AAA production values needs good funding. It's better that we ask now and see if there is a market for our idea. Using milestone based funding means we ensure there is enough demand before we go to bigger, riskier steps of development. We prefer this to asking for a lump-sum of hundreds of thousands up-front and then realizing too late that there is not enough demand later on to justify development. So far, our method has been popular and demand is 5x-10x what it was from our last milestone. So things look very promising.</p>
<h3>Fixed Funding, All or Nothing</h3>
<p>Since we are asking for more, we've moved to a fixed funding mode for this milestone. Either we raise our goal of $20,000, or we find out there is not enough demand and stop here having delivered successfully on our last two milestones. No backers will be changed for this milestone if it does not fund. Since we raised $23,000 on our last milestone, and our community is 5-10x the size we feel confident this is a realistic goal.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Over our past 2 successful fundraisers, we've grown more confident about addressing the challenges we identified in the past:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Market Interest: </strong>There may not be enough interest to complete all the funding steps necessary for the playable mockup. However, we've had 2 successfully delivered fundraisers that reached 469-600% of our goals and have also grown the community to over 10,000 people. We feel there is good interest here.</li>
<li>
<strong>Technology:  </strong>There is a risk that the game engine cannot reach the goals we are striving for. Since then we have made our first prototype in Unreal Engine 4, and also made a internal prototype server with the help of one of Nostalrius' (legacy wow server) server programmers help. We feel more certain about accomplishing our multiplayer goals and our terraforming terrain goals in a large open world.</li>
<li>
<strong>Unforeseen Risks. </strong>The path to making a game is always fraught with risk. We've mitigated this by breaking the project down into separate fundraisers on a milestone basis. You can see where the project is going step by step. This new approach to fundraising helps mitigate risk and build confidence. So far, it's working!</li>

We will include combat music in the game AND the PLAYABLE MOCKUP composed and performed by Michael Bross, Firefall's Audio Director and Composer.
 
Here it is, our 3rd successful milestone goal on Indiegogo!
Em-8ER is a game with a fanbase!

Games take a lot of funding to create. Instead of one large goal, we divided ours into cheaper, smaller steps and deliver the latest version of our game to you along the way. Each smaller funding step entitles you to new collectable skins and perks and lets you build confidence in the progress of our unique massive planetary wargame!
Your incredible support has driven our last 2  successfully delivered IndieGoGo campaigns to well over 469-600% of our goals. We're confident you can make this one a huge success too! With our community at over 10,000 fans, we're bigger than ever and growing! 8300 on our mailing list, 4900 on our forums, 2300 in our discord chat server, and another 4700 on our change.org petition. You fans have been amazing in your support!
Don't forget to visit our website for much more detail about the game and progress so far!
Mine with MEK/A not pickaxes! Mine resources with your calldown pet mech and craft everything in the world from weapons to abilities to bases to help fight the massive war against Kaiju invaders. Mining is combat oriented, fight against waves of enemies. The longer you last, the more precious the ore!
Em-8ER - A Massive Battle Fought Online

Em-8ER is played online, in a persistent open world where players must conquer and terraform new territory and wage a huge war against an aggressive shape-shifting group of aliens and monstrous creatures. While there is nothing quite like Em-8ER, we've been influenced by games/films/anime such as:


Planetside 2 - Massive open world wars, but ours are PvE.

Firefall - Jetpacks, gliding and thumping. Fast movement.

Starcraft - RTS base building (We worked on this game too)

Pacific Rim - Kaiju! Giant monster battles!

Attack on Titan - Fast, agile humans with vertical combat vs giants.

Xenoblade Chronicles - Mecha! But ours are smaller, more like exosuits.

Em-8ER offers a a blend taken from a little bit of each of these inspirations, and more. Our experience with delivering large scale worlds like World of Warcraft and Firefall mean we are in a unique position to deliver on this vision.
Furious Mech vs Monster Combat

Pilot MEK suits called ""omniframes"" in fast paced gunplay and brutal melee combat. Grapple with the Tsi-Hu in their dangerous, bladed beast forms and use finisher moves to eliminate your enemies. Craft and collect multiple omniframes, load them out with your own weapons and abilities, and make your combat style truly unique. Jet up, skim the terrain, and glide over landscapes in nimble combat maneuvers.
Craft Everything, Build Bases

Mine precious resources with giant autonomous drill-mechs known as MEK/A. Use those resources to craft everything in the game from weapons and abilities, to establishing and upgrading huge military bases. Research tech trees to unlock higher tiers of crafting and join with other players to pool resources to build bigger and better fortifications and upgrades for bases
Terraform the World

Conquer new zones and terraform them by establishing bases and deploying giant atmospheric machines that churn the atmosphere and gradually alter the landscape into lush biomes. The more you terraform the world, the more unique resources and crafting tiers are unlocked. Players must all work together in a huge group effort to advance the state of the world and defend it from destructive invasion by the Tsi-Hu and their giant monsters.
Giant Kaiju Monster Battles

The Tsi-Hu enslave and use giant, tech-augmented monsters called kaiju as their siege weapons. The Tsi-Hu have blended their technology with the beasts, augmenting them to control them and equip them with advanced weapons and shield generators. These giant beasts rip through bases and can lay waste to entire zones. Players must band together to bring them down.
Immediate Rewards for New Backers!
In addition to this fundraiser's new goals of characters, weapons, and shooting mechanics, and the eventual playable mockup, ALL new backers will receive immediate rewards.
New backers will receive (at the close of this campaign), the PDF design vision book (with 20 pages of lore, game design and illustrations), as well as the downloadable first build of the game: the THMPR Art Demo made with Unreal Engine 4.

The unreal test dummy is temporary. The THMPR and landscape are original. As a eligible backer, you will be emailed a download link to this current exe art demo as soon as the campaign ends.

This 20 page, full-color, illustrated PDF describes the main vision of the game: it's lore, crafting systems, invasions and base building, and much more. It will be emailed to eligible backers as soon as the campaign ends.
 
World Class Experienced Team
If you are new to Em-8ER, welcome! My name is Mark Kern, and I create worlds with my fantastic teams. I lead the creation of World of Warcraft at Blizzard (team lead on vanilla) and also helped lead the petition with Nostalrius to bring back legacy servers on WoW. Em-8ER is the game I've always wanted to make: an online game where hundreds of players wage a persistent war in an openworld shooter against a ruthless enemy AI!

Lead by Mark Kern, Team Lead, original Vanilla WoW.
We are currently a team of 6-7 working part-time on Em-8ER's playable mockup in preparation for launching a full-time game company. We have years of experience making massive worlds and intense shooters. Some of the games we have worked on include:


Working Pilots, Geesuits in MEKs!
At the successful completion of this milestone, you will be able to climb into your omniframe MEK with your choice of male or female pilot in their sleek geesuits (pilot suits). Glide, skim and jet over 1/2 sq kilometers of terrain. Then deploy your omniframe's weapon systems. and start shooting! We'll provide plenty of static targets for you to practice on while we wait on the Tsi-Hu shape-shifting enemy milestone!


The male and female zBrush sculpts are complete, but we need to finish their textures, low-poly LODs and get them into the game with finely rendered hair. Backing the milestone will help go towards compensating the artist for what they have already done and finish the last steps.

The medium omniframe in development. Pilots sit exposed under shields. Player can equip a ""hard driver"" mode to place a hard shell to completely encase the pilot if desired.
Guns!
This milestone we are creating the art pipeline for our modular gun system. Everything is crafted in Em-8ER and you can choose what weapons you want to equip as loadouts on your omniframe. The milestone will feature at least one gun and basic shooting mechanics at static targets. But the art pipeline should allow a small team like our to create the looks we need to support a variety of crafting weapons.
 

The KAIJU SLAYER perk allow you to pick components from our art library to build your own custom gun, then art direct us on color and look as we create a custom skin for your unique combination.

This is the ""geesuit"" a survival suit worn by Gatestrider players. It allows them to withstand harsh gravity and temperatures. The FOUNDERS version will allow the founder to set the stripes to GLOW and CONTROL THE COLOR of the emissive glow and CHANGE it at any time or set it to cycle CHROMA style in fading cycling colors.
What we already have, or are about to have working:

1/2 square kilometers of icy terrain
Spawning, patrolling, drilling and emoting THMPR mining MEK/A
Omniframe exosuit/MEK armor (in progress)
Walking, running, gliding, jetting omniframes (in progress)

What we are creating this milestone:

Male and Female pilot bodies, faces and hair
Geesuit concept art and modeling
Animations for player characters, run/walk, board and exit omniframe
Omniframe opening/closing animations for pilots
Concept & design modular gun system (for art pipeline)
Model enough parts for at least one gun
Animate shooting, gun FX, and sound fx
Provide static targets for shooting at and destroying

 
Milestones? What are those?
Em-8ER takes a unique approach to crowd-funding and building a community around the game. We recognize there is a lot of skepticism and worry about funding games on sites like IndieGoGo. We wanted to build trust, momentum and community to address that. Instead of asking for hundreds of thousands up front and never delivering until alpha or beta, we create smaller milestones instead:

Milestones are short, achievable steps and goals for the game. The community can inspect each milestone and determine if they want to see it continue by funding, or encouraging their friends to fund the next. This grows the audience and community for the game as we build trust and deliver results. So far we have successfully funded and delivered 2 milestones for Em-8ER at 460-600% of our original goals and grown to nearly 10,000 community members. It appears to be working!
This has benefits for us, the developers, too. First, we don't end up building a game where there is not enough demand or community. Second, we also avoid wandering off course or into feature creep as we have to keep very focused on these smaller goals. Finally, we get to grow an enthusiastic, excited community over time, not based on hype, but based on what they've actually played.
The ultimate goal is to have a couple of milestones to build our first playable mockup of the game. This is what devs call a ""vertical slice,"" which is taking the core elements of gameplay and fully rendering them to see how it looks/feels. This is used to ultimately approve full development of the project. Only, in this case, it is the community instead of a publisher who will be approving our playable mockup. We will hold a large fundraiser when we complete the mockup in order to start everyone on a full-time production schedule.
Becoming a backer gives you access to this milestone, its exclusive rewards, as well as the final playable mockup. We will be focusing on the frenetic combat feel of Em-8ER. The THMPR will drop down and start mining for resources while being attacked by waves of shape-shifting Tsi-Hu. Players must defend the THMPR to extract as many resources as possible while trading fire, using abilities, and jetting and gliding around the combat area.
 
The Perks:


 

All backers receive the last THMPR art build (in Unreal Engine) and PDF book
Deepscanner and above will receive this goals build as well as the FINAL game and playable prototype (if all milestones fully funded).
Deepscanner and above will receive the Character Omniframe/Shooting build as well as the upcoming Omniframe art build.
3D printer files let you use a 3D printer to print parts for a bust of the THMPR mining MEK/A. Assembly required, but parts can be outsourced to places like shapeways.com
Founder Omniframe skin is skin exclusive to this milestone. It will not be available any other milestone and will ship with the final game. This will be for each of the three frame sizes (light/med/heavy).
Founder THMPR emote pack will give your THMPR three extra emotes exclusive to this milestone and not found in others: /rude, /victory, and /conga. To be delivered in final game. /rude is just like the one removed from WoW and will never be removed from Em-8ER. /conga will chain THMPRs together in a conga line.
Name reservation and guild name reservation are new for this milestone. They will apply to final game ship.
Founder geesuits is also exclusive to this milestone and not available in any other milestone. Male and female variants included. Show off the fact that you were first to land on Em-8ER!
Deepstrike THMPR - This special skin is black with red accents and has a unique feature. Instead of dropping in by dropship, it teleports in with a unique effect. This is purely cosmetic and has no gameplay changes. It is also exclusive to this milestone and won't be offered again.
Custom Base Banners - These are black and white symbols that you get to design within our guidelines. They are displayed on large banners on the sides of the nexus buildings of bases you contribute to. The top 10 contributors of resources to a base have their banners displayed like a leaderboard on the sides of the nexus.
Gold skins - Gold skins use our PBR advanced shaders in Unreal 4 to provide a real polished look.
Playable Mockup and Final Game multiples - At higher tiers, these will let you provide additional copies of either the playable mockup or final game to your friends. Contingent on all milestone funding. They are not cumulative perk to perk (important!)
Custom Gun Skin - Our highest perk. This allows you to design a gun from the library of parts we use to assemble them, and then design a custom skin to go over the parts. You may claim this reward later, as you play the game and determine which weapon type is your favorite.
Any entry marked as (final game) or including a prior perk with (final game) means this is only shipped if game is fully funded and completed and is not guaranteed.
Final Playable mockup is also contingent on all milestone goals being funded. We anticipate another 2-3 after this current one.

 
A Special Offer for Firefall Veterans
If you played the beta or early versions of Firefall, you might be familiar with some of the invasion, resource gathering, and crafting aspects that will be featured in Em-8ER.  Since Em-8ER is, in some ways, a spiritual successor to Firefall, we are extending a future virtual store credit towards Em-8ER for eligible Firefall veterans. Find out more on our Firefall Credit Program website. Why $20,000?
The money raised for this milestone will be used towards the creation of a LOT of assets and functionality this milestone:

Male & Female playable characters
Characters functioning inside and piloting Omniframes
Gee-suits, clothing for the characters (concept & modeling)
Animation of the characters
Weapon system concept and design. Modeling 1st gun
Basic Shooting mechanics (temporary targets)
Scripting & Coding
Sound and visual effects

We're raising more this round because of this, and because of features and speed. We want to be able to devote more hours and more team members to build a faster momentum behind game builds and deliverables. We also want to properly budget for animation, which we missed last milestone.
Finally, $20,000 is a good litmus test for us. Making an indie game of this scope, and targeting near AAA production values needs good funding. It's better that we ask now and see if there is a market for our idea. Using milestone based funding means we ensure there is enough demand before we go to bigger, riskier steps of development. We prefer this to asking for a lump-sum of hundreds of thousands up-front and then realizing too late that there is not enough demand later on to justify development. So far, our method has been popular and demand is 5x-10x what it was from our last milestone. So things look very promising.
Fixed Funding, All or Nothing
Since we are asking for more, we've moved to a fixed funding mode for this milestone. Either we raise our goal of $20,000, or we find out there is not enough demand and stop here having delivered successfully on our last two milestones. No backers will be changed for this milestone if it does not fund. Since we raised $23,000 on our last milestone, and our community is 5-10x the size we feel confident this is a realistic goal.

Risks & Challenges
Over our past 2 successful fundraisers, we've grown more confident about addressing the challenges we identified in the past:


Market Interest: There may not be enough interest to complete all the funding steps necessary for the playable mockup. However, we've had 2 successfully delivered fundraisers that reached 469-600% of our goals and have also grown the community to over 10,000 people. We feel there is good interest here.

Technology:  There is a risk that the game engine cannot reach the goals we are striving for. Since then we have made our first prototype in Unreal Engine 4, and also made a internal prototype server with the help of one of Nostalrius' (legacy wow server) server programmers help. We feel more certain about accomplishing our multiplayer goals and our terraforming terrain goals in a large open world.

Unforeseen Risks. The path to making a game is always fraught with risk. We've mitigated this by breaking the project down into separate fundraisers on a milestone basis. You can see where the project is going step by step. This new approach to fundraising helps mitigate risk and build confidence. So far, it's working!

<div>First, the  player will purchase a number of loadout packs.  The player will  then move back to the main menu, then select multiplayers.   At this point, the player will move to a pre-game screen showing your map and other important information.

<h3>Evolution of Maximum Fantasy Sports (""MFS"")</h3> <p></p>
<p>My name is Bill Parsons and I have been playing fantasy
sports since I was a kid using baseball cards, dice and See-Action Football
projection slides. After leaving my parent’s house and beginning my adulthood,
that youthful exuberance for fantasy sports followed me and I began running my
own fantasy leagues on notepads.
The birth of the internet made this much easier, but the companies operating
the fantasy sites did not offer the vast features that I incorporated into my
fantasy leagues. Instead of dumbing my games down, I joined forces with friends
and built Maximum Fantasy Sports (“MFS”). We built the site for the devout
fantasy football players with features that no other site offered. The majors,
Yahoo, ESPN and CBS, have since incorporated a few of our unique features, but
we still have many more that they are not willing to attempt to incorporate into
their offerings.</p>
<p>No other site offers the full suite of fantasy fantasy football leagues and pools that MFS does. The hottest games in the fantasy universe right now are the Daily and
Weekly fantasy football contests, hosted by such companies as FanDuel and DraftKings, but they do
not offer pools or any full-season fantasy leagues. The other majors mentioned
previously do not offer Daily and Weekly contests. We are the only site that
offers all products that a fantasy player would want. Our problem is that we do
not have the budget that the other companies have and have earmarked the
majority of our budget each year to development and testing. </p>
<p></p>

<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>How To Put MFS On The Map</h3>
<p>We are happy with the products that we offer and need to
spread the word about who we are and what we offer. The majority of fantasy
football players do not just play one game. Many of them with have a
full-season fantasy league and augment their experience with football pools and
now many are turning to the short-term contests as well. If we can position MFS
in front of them, they will see that they can get all of their needs in one
location. There is no longer a reason to have leagues spread across two or
three websites. We are out of budget and need your help to spread the word
about MFS!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, “Field Of Dreams” is just a movie. We built
it, but they won’t come unless they know about it! We need the means and
assistance to spread the word. We plan on quick advertising hits for the remainder of this season such as Google Adwords and banner advertising across various NFL sports forums and NFL-related sports sites. This is the quickest way to get the word out that we are familiar with. We would like to build immediate interest to help fuel the current fire and bring in additional revenue to help with wider advertising approaches to really get us into the public's eye for 2015.</p>
<p>Investors will receive free leagues, free entries in Daily and/or Weekly contests, some MFS swag and, for investors looking to advertise, we can add your advertising to various pages on the website and/or incorporated into the various email communication that we send out throughout the week. MFS is a live site with hundreds of active leagues and about 15,000 active users participating in these leagues.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Industry</h3> <p></p>
<p>An estimated 41 million people will play some sort of fantasy sports in the U.S. and Canada this year, up from 32 million in 2012, according to the FSTA (Fantasy Sports Trade Association}, with nearly 37 million people playing fantasy football this year.</p>
<p>Participation in all fantasy sports has grown by more than 60 percent the last four years with 19 percent of all males in the U.S. playing fantasy sports. According to the FSTA, around $1.6 billion is spent across all fantasy sports on items like apps and access to pro sports packages for fantasy player tracking. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Another $1.7 billion is spent on entry fees to fantasy leagues at an average of $70 to $100 per person. </span></p>
<p>Daily/Weekly Fantasy Football is the largest growth segment in the industry. In terms of the market size, D/W is still a relatively small industry. However, the growth trajectory has been astounding and estimates suggest player spending (i.e. total entry fees) on D/W sites will likely exceed the total amount wagered annually on sports in Las Vegas by CY15 and all of Nevada by CY16. </p>

Additionally, we have developed a social network that is geared to a sports-centric infrastructure, but that is for a different focus.</p>
<p>· <b>In-game player changes</b>.
No other company offers the option of swapping players in and out of starting
roster positions at the end of quarters or halves. With an increasing number of
customers connected to the internet on a constant basis, this feature needs to
be advertised to the fantasy football community. It is a major selling point to
fantasy football aficionados.</p>
<p>· <b>Bye Week Rollover</b>.
No other company offers the option of being able to elect to roll over a
player’s performance for the week prior to his Bye Week. This feature needs to
be advertised to the fantasy football community. It is a major selling point to
fantasy football aficionados.</p>
<p>· <b>League Average</b>.
MFS allows configuration of a common opponent for all teams called the League
Average. This opponent has no team but receives a score for the week which is
the average of all league teams’ score. So, a team will play two games per
week; one against a head-to-head opponent and one against the League Average
opponent. This feature is very rare and not offered by any of the majors.</p>

<h2>-- The Pitch Media --</h2>

<h2>Take My Souls</h2>
<p>Take My Souls is a multiplayer online video game, which tests the player on his luck and skills.</p>
<p>Based on the Warcraft III mod, ""Castle Fight"", players summon souls in their base, and watch them spawn bodies to fight the opposition!</p>
<h3>- Card Game Mechanism</h3>
<p>Take My Souls integrates the idea of a card game mechanism, with its deck being called the Vault, which stores a total of 40 souls. There may be duplicate souls in each player's vault, and may different souls can be bought in a virtual shop.</p>
<p>In the game, players will have a hand of 7 souls, and souls are drawn from the Vault whenever he plays a soul, or reshuffles the soul for an Energy cost.</p>
<h3>- Souls</h3>
<p>Souls are like the cards in the game, and players summon them using some Energy. There will be many souls in the game when its released (at least 50!!). They have their own evolution chain, such as a Peasant soul being able to evolve into a Knight soul, or Archer soul, and so on.</p>
<h3>- Bodies</h3>
<p>Each soul when placed in the game, will periodically spawn a body. Bodies are the fighters in the game, they are exact replicas of the soul, but they can move and attack the enemies! An Archer soul will spawn an Archer body, and the Archer body will move forward and attack the enemies. Each kind of body will have its own skills, such as Power Shot for Archer, and Ally Heal for Priest.</p>
<h3>- Energy</h3>
<p>Summoning and evolving souls cost Energy, so players must strategically counter the opposition. When the team's bodies kill the enemy team's bodies, Energy is earned. There is also income system which periodically gives Energy based on the number of Souls placed.</p>
<p>If a player's hand has only evolution souls, he may have to reshuffle them into the Vault and draw new Souls, and this costs energy.</p>
<h3>- Matchmaking</h3>
<p>Games will be split into matches, where players or parties put themselves into a matchmaking system, and they will enter a 3v3 battle. To win, the team must summon souls and bodies to destroy the enemies' castle.</p>
<h3>- Platforms</h3>
<p>This game will first be released on the PC, and be ported over to mobile platforms (iOS, Android, Windows Phone).</p>
<h3>- Development Progress</h3>
<p>Take My Souls is currently in very early stages of development, and is estimated to be ready by late 2012, as a free-to-play game with microtransactions.</p>
<p>The game servers and master server is being developed concurrently too, and players may host their own game rooms for a pre-made 3v3 match.</p>
<p>Once released, developments will be ongoing and updates will be added for free.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I'm a game programmer, age 19, from Singapore. I am trying my best to make my dream a reality, which is to create and publish a game of my own.</p>
<p>I studied games and programming, and I am able to do C++, C#, Java, ActionScript, objective-C.</p>

<p>As seen in the video of Take My Souls, the graphical assets are actually royalty-free images, and there are no sounds too. I hope that you will be able to contribute to my humble goal of $500.</p>
<p>The funds will be spent wisely to:</p>

<li>Hire an artist</li>
<li>Hire an audio professional</li>
<li>Hosting servers (Web Server + Game Master Server)</li>

</h3>
<p>Dungeon Legend was birthed in the heart of professional 3D/Game artist, and owner of 3D Attack, Thomas Pasieka in 2009. His love for games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Baldur's Gate and Diablo were the inspiration behind his desire to take on a project as sensational as Dungeon Legend. Knowing he would need a programmer he contacted Jon Tiller of Spark GFX.  Jon has been developing professionally for web, multimedia and games since 1995.

Dungeon Legend was birthed in the heart of professional 3D/Game artist, and owner of 3D Attack, Thomas Pasieka in 2009. His love for games like Dungeons & Dragons, Baldur's Gate and Diablo were the inspiration behind his desire to take on a project as sensational as Dungeon Legend. Knowing he would need a programmer he contacted Jon Tiller of Spark GFX.  Jon has been developing professionally for web, multimedia and games since 1995. A composer/sound effects artist, character/creature artist, concept artist and animation/rigging artist were soon added to the team.

<h3><strong><em>UPDATE MAY 17 2 Weeks Left! --------------------------------</em></strong></h3>
<p>2 Weeks left to make this game a reality!<br/><br/>We have 2 weeks left on indiegogo and still a long way to go. Looking at it realistically I dont think the $18,000 goal is going to be hit but that doesn't mean things are over. If we can raise enough funds I can still put together something that is fun and fit as many features in as I can.<br/><br/>If you know ANYONE who would be interested in putting even $10 towards this game idea now is the time to reach out to them. If you have a favorite game site or forum please post some info about the game. Below is a breakdown I've put together of smaller goal tiers to shoot for:<br/><br/>Goal Tiers<br/>------------</p>
<p><br/>- $1500(current rank) - Unity Pro - The currently raised money is going to one purchase, the Unity Pro license. This will allow for some upgrades in lighting and other back end processes.<br/><br/>- $4000 - Online Ranking System - If we can raise $4000 I can spend a couple months to develop a robust online ranking system. This will include individual win ranking, rankings for the best players of each character, AND a faction based ranking allowing players to fight for their favorite company in the console wars!<br/><br/>- $6000 - Graphic Additions - At $6000 I can spend some time upgrading the graphics to include full normal mapping for the characters, upgraded shaders, and more work on the visual effects.<br/><br/>- $8000 - Single Player Content - At $8000 I can spend about 5 months on the game full time. This will allow me to add in some robust single player features such as a fully featured training mode including dummy recording and link timing indicators. Also a full mission mode which will include a dummy to beat on inspired by Kudo Tsunoda!<br/><br/>- $10000 - Complete Package - If we can raise $10000 I can complete this game nearly to the level initially planned. I will have to slum it a little more than I had hoped but I can do it. This will also mean no contract work for the audio and animation so those will be lower quality overall.<br/><br/>- $14000 - Contract Audio + Animation - At $14000 I can finish the game on time as planned with some kick ass Audio and Animation to boot. I have the contractors super excited to work (all have worked in the game industry) I just need to line up the pay.<br/><br/>- $18000 - Rollback Netcode (GGPO style) - One of the major reasons I am spending the time I am on this game is to get the netcode right. A fighting game requires a precision and plays at a speed that standard interpolation netcode isn't sufficient for. The plan is to implement a GGPO style rollback netcode into the game. Of course that will take time which in turn costs money. <br/><br/>Thank you guys for all the help and support you've given me so far. I just need a little more of a push for this last 2 weeks to make it come together. If you have any ideas or questions please post them.</p>
<h3><strong><em>UPDATE MAY 9 Hype Trailer! ----------------------------------</em></strong></h3>
<p> <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Leh777SVqA8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.wakinggames.com/Expo-Fighter/youtube.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p>
<p>The first promo trailer is live on youtube. A huge thank you to everyone involved. This will be going out to major gaming site to generate buzz for the project.</p>
<p>Some bad news, I found out the hard way that Twitch.tv doesnt archive your old streams unless you specifiy it so many of the previous streams have been deleted :(. At least most of the work was focused on the trailer and not the game proper so it wasnt too important. Good to know from now on though.</p>
<h3><em><strong>UPDATE APR 27 Character 2 model nearly complete -----------</strong></em></h3>
<p><em><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.wakinggames.com/Expo-Fighter/matchWire.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></em></p>
<p>working hard on the model for the second character Donny Matchstick. He should be done by May 1.</p>
<p>I am going to be shooting a live action portion of the teaser trailer next Friday. If you are going to be in Vancouver on May 4th come down to the VFS game design campus at 4:00pm to join in and get hype!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><em><strong>UPDATE APR 19  <strong>Reggie is ready ------------------------------</strong></strong></em></h3>
<h3><em><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.wakinggames.com/Expo-Fighter/reg_unityGOGO.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></em></h3>
<p>The model of our first character, Regicide, is complete and in engine. He seems pretty happy about it. I hit my target time estimates pretty well; he took about 24 hours to get to this state. </p>
<p>Next up is animation...</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><em><strong>UPDATE APR 17  <strong>Answering some questions -------------------</strong></strong></em></h3>
<p><em>I want to answer some questions that have come up a lot lately. If you have a question please ask me at <a href=""mailto:miggsthejust@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">miggsthejust@gmail.com</a></em></p>
<h2><strong>F.A.Q.</strong></h2>
<p><em><strong>Who are you and why would I give you money?</strong></em></p>
<p>I am a game designer who has been working in the industry for 7 years now. During that time I have been a developer on 3 indie projects in varying roles:</p>
<p><a href=""http://onceuponatime.wakinggames.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><em><strong>Once Upon a Time</strong></em></a> - Role: Combat designer/Level designer</p>
<p><em><strong><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CkaoFEdlb9s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Super RPG Boss Battle Master</a> </strong>(coming soon)</em> - Role: Scripter/Game designer</p>
<p><em><strong><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Drumskulls/149901498364990"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DrumSkulls</a> </strong></em>(<em>unreleased</em>) - Role: Level designer/Game designer</p>
<p>In addition to working on game projects I have been an instructor of game design at Vancouver Film School game design program. There I taught classes in game mechanics (awarded best course by students) and level design as well as mentored over 50 student final projects (basically 3 month game projects). </p>
<p>I have a strong background in fighting games, playing for many years and running many tournaments and ranbats in the vancouver area. </p>
<p>This project is a labor of love for me. I have been working towards this for many years and I am at a point in my career where I have the understanding to create a strong game design and implement it effectively.</p>
<p>If you have reservations about contributing based on my experience or understanding I urge you to watch the live stream at <a href=""http://www.twitch.tv/miggsthejust"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">twitch.tv/miggsthejust</a> to see how I work and even ask me any questions you might have.</p>
<p><em><strong>Why are you creating this by yourself?</strong></em></p>
<p>This isnt entirely true, I am the project lead and will be handling a majority of the work, but I will be contracting several key pieces of the project. I will be contracting the design of the interface and menus out to another designer as well as the music of the game. These contracts are factored into the contribution goal.</p>
<p>What I dont want is to talk people into working on this game for free. I've worked on many projects where this was the case and not only is it a disservice to the talent these guys have, it also puts a lot of pressure on the project to generate a lot of money just to cover backpay. I'd rather not end up in that situation again.</p>
<p>I feel I've been able to scope this project so that it is manageable with my personal skillset, and I will be able to deliver an engaging, well built game on time based on the project budget. That being said, if we are able to raise beyond the project goal, I will be seriously considering bringing more talent on board to make the final game even more polished.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><em><strong>$18000 seems a little odd, where does the money go?</strong></em></p>
<p>$18000 is the number I determined would be a realistic project budget for the timeline and quality I am looking to achieve. Let me break it down a bit:</p>
<p>Indiegogo 4% cut - $720 (if I raise the full amount, if not $1620)</p>
<p>Contributor Perk costs - $1500 </p>
<p>Monthly Development costs for 8 month dev cycle - $1400 ($11200 total)</p>
<p>Pay for Contract work - $5000</p>
<p>These are rounded numbers and dont necessarily take into account the odds and ends fees that tend to come up. I feel it is a reasonable budget for a project of this size. Please email me if you have any further questions about the budget, I'm completely open to answering them.</p>
<p><em><strong>What happens if we dont reach the project goal?</strong></em></p>
<p>The Indiegogo flexible funding system works a little different than Kickstarter in that if the project goal isnt reached by the deadline the project will still receive the money raised.</p>
<p>That being said, if we dont raise the full $18000 amount <strong>I Promise </strong>to contact each contributor directly and ask them if they want the money sent back. It is fully up to you. I will still be giving out all the perks that have been promised and I will still use all of the money raised to finance the game project. I will still be developing the game, but it will either be scoped down or will be delayed until I can raise money from other sources or finish the game as a part time project.</p>
<p><em><strong>What happens if we pass the project goal?</strong></em></p>
<p>If the campaign is able to raise above the $18000 goal, I will move the project forward into some of the stretch goals planned for the game. Integrating GGPO netcode into the online play is a major one. Hiring on more developers in order to increase the character count to 6 is another.</p>
<p><em><strong>What is Unique about EXPO Fighter</strong></em></p>
<p>Expo Fighter is a traditional 2D fighter and in that vein I didn't want to reinvent the wheel when it came to the general game system. That being said, the ability to chain EX attacks together to allow for custom supers and the meter costing parry system are both improvements that I believe will give the gameplay a fresh feel, and will engage fighting game fans.</p>
<p>But Remember this is a game where you play as the President of Nintendo piledriving the President of Sony into the pavement! The game is full of E3 inspired insanity and that alone will make it a hilarious experience.</p>
<p><strong></strong><em><strong>I don't like your perks, can I have something else?</strong></em></p>
<p>In short, Yes! I want to create perks that will get people excited about helping out. If there's something you want to see, let me know and I'll do my best to make it happen.</p>

<h3>ROUND 1: FIGHT!</h3>
<p>Hello Internets, my name is Justin Meagher and I have been designing and instructing the design of video games for seven years here in Vancouver,BC. Recently I was laid off from one of the big companies in town and I decided this would be a chance for me to fulfill a game design dream I have had for a while now; create a fighting game. </p>
<p>I have been playing fighters since I was nine years old playing at the corner hockey card shop and fighting games have been a major influence on the way I approach designing games. For a while now I have been refining a design for a fighter, developing an interesting theme, and researching the tech involved. Now seems like the perfect time to move forward.</p>
<p>The problem of course comes down to money as always, and that's where <strong>YOU</strong> can have a huge influence. My goal is to raise 18000$ dollars over the coming few months to finance the development of a small web browser based fighting game. The majority of this amount is to cover development expenses while working full time on the project. If I am not able to reach this goal I will probably have to put a halt on the work until I can generate the funding which will probably mean the game will not be released on time. <strong>I need your help on this one.</strong></p>
<h3>ROUND 2: EXPO FIGHTER</h3>
<p>I am looking to create a web browser based fighting game to be released by June 1st 2013. The game is tentatively titled EXPO Fighter and it parodies the silliness surrounding the large video game expo's and announcements by pitting major game company exec inspired characters against one another. </p>
<p>The game features 2D gameplay with 3D graphics similar to Street Fighter 4 or Mortal Kombat 9, and will be released with 3 fully playable characters to start. The game will support local multiplayer and will have fully featured online play. I plan to have an individual online ranking system in place along with a faction based ranking system so that players can battle it out to see who wins the console wars once and for all.</p>
<p>There are some interesting gameplay systems planned and over the course of the month I am going to be talking in depth about them. If you wish you will also be able to see and take part in the development process itself.</p>
<h3>ROUND 3: THE LIVE STREAM</h3>
<p>This is somewhat of an iron man challenge for me; designing, coding, and creating the art for a fighting game in 1 year! So I thought this would be an interesting way to open up the game creation process and let you see how I go about this project. </p>
<p>Starting April 1st I am going to begin live streaming my work on this game in its entirety. Each night I will alternate working on the design, the scripting, or the art of the game and live stream it for anyone to watch. If you want to learn about the process, if you are interested in fighting games, or if you just want to come make fun of me you can check out the insanity at <a href=""http://www.twitch.tv/miggsthejust"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">twitch.tv/miggsthejust</a>!</p>
<h3>YOU WIN! PERFECT!</h3>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to read over this pitch, I really appreciate it. I am very excited to attempt this project and you can make it all possible with your support. Feel free to email me at <a href=""mailto:miggsthejust@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">miggsthejust@gmail.com</a> if you have any questions about the project. </p>
<p>There are going to be a lot of updates over the coming month, follow me on twitter <a href=""http://twitter.com/expofighter"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">@expofighter</a> to keep up with the development.</p>
<h3><em><strong>--------------------------------------------------------------</strong></em></h3>
<h2><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.wakinggames.com/Expo-Fighter/gameplayBanner.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h2>
<p><strong><em>NOTE: Expo Fighter is still very early in development, but let's go over some of the currently planned mechanics.</em></strong></p>
<h3>BASICS</h3>
<p>Much of Expo Fighters gameplay follows the standard format of traditional 2D fighters: players choose one of a selection of characters and attempt to knockout the opposing players character by reducing their health gauge to zero. By default a player needs to do this 2 out of three times to win the game.</p>
<p>Expo Fighter uses a set of directional buttons/keys and a four button/key attack layout.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.wakinggames.com/Expo-Fighter/webControls.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Throws are executed with the two light attacks.</p>
<p>Each character has a set of unique standard attacks and special attacks.</p>
<h3>GENERAL FEEL</h3>
<p>I'm attempting to create a fighter that I don't feel exists in the current market, a game with strongly defined character match-ups but gives the player the freedom to freestyle within those defined boundaries.</p>
<p>Movement speeds will be fast overall and hit stun will be high in general to allow for players to create a strong offense. At the same time smart defense and good reads will have strong rewards.</p>
<p>I like the purity of a meterless fighter such as SF2 Hyper Fighting but I also think there is a lot of strategic possibilities in meter management. I'm attempting to create a nice middle ground allowing for a flexible meter management game without it overwhelming the fundamental game.</p>
<h3>HYPE GAUGE</h3>
<p>Players generate hype by connecting attacks and successfully blocking attacks. Hype charges the hype gauge up to four levels. These levels can then be spent offensively or defensively to gain a stronger advantage. Unused hype stays stored in between game rounds.</p>
<h3>HYPE ATTACKS</h3>
<p>Players can spend a hype gauge level to turn a special attack into a hype attack. Hype gives an attack new properties such as increased hit stun, overhead properties, or invincibility frames.</p>
<p>One unique aspect of Hype attacks is that many of them can be chained together into a combo if the player wishes to spend the hype gauge. This allows players flexible options to increase damage or create pressure.</p>

<p><strong><em><br/></em></strong></p></div>","EXPO FIGHTER is a free to play web browser fighting game pitting video game industry inspired characters against one another. The creation of the game will be live streamed throughout the entire development. EXPO FIGHTER is planned for release by June 1st 2013.
I am asking for your help to raise $18000 to fund the development of this game project.
 

UPDATE MAY 17 2 Weeks Left! --------------------------------
2 Weeks left to make this game a reality!We have 2 weeks left on indiegogo and still a long way to go. Looking at it realistically I dont think the $18,000 goal is going to be hit but that doesn't mean things are over. If we can raise enough funds I can still put together something that is fun and fit as many features in as I can.If you know ANYONE who would be interested in putting even $10 towards this game idea now is the time to reach out to them. If you have a favorite game site or forum please post some info about the game. Below is a breakdown I've put together of smaller goal tiers to shoot for:Goal Tiers------------
- $1500(current rank) - Unity Pro - The currently raised money is going to one purchase, the Unity Pro license. This will allow for some upgrades in lighting and other back end processes.- $4000 - Online Ranking System - If we can raise $4000 I can spend a couple months to develop a robust online ranking system. This will include individual win ranking, rankings for the best players of each character, AND a faction based ranking allowing players to fight for their favorite company in the console wars!- $6000 - Graphic Additions - At $6000 I can spend some time upgrading the graphics to include full normal mapping for the characters, upgraded shaders, and more work on the visual effects.- $8000 - Single Player Content - At $8000 I can spend about 5 months on the game full time. This will allow me to add in some robust single player features such as a fully featured training mode including dummy recording and link timing indicators. Also a full mission mode which will include a dummy to beat on inspired by Kudo Tsunoda!- $10000 - Complete Package - If we can raise $10000 I can complete this game nearly to the level initially planned. I will have to slum it a little more than I had hoped but I can do it. This will also mean no contract work for the audio and animation so those will be lower quality overall.- $14000 - Contract Audio + Animation - At $14000 I can finish the game on time as planned with some kick ass Audio and Animation to boot. I have the contractors super excited to work (all have worked in the game industry) I just need to line up the pay.- $18000 - Rollback Netcode (GGPO style) - One of the major reasons I am spending the time I am on this game is to get the netcode right. A fighting game requires a precision and plays at a speed that standard interpolation netcode isn't sufficient for. The plan is to implement a GGPO style rollback netcode into the game. Of course that will take time which in turn costs money. Thank you guys for all the help and support you've given me so far. I just need a little more of a push for this last 2 weeks to make it come together. If you have any ideas or questions please post them.
UPDATE MAY 9 Hype Trailer! ----------------------------------
 
The first promo trailer is live on youtube. A huge thank you to everyone involved. This will be going out to major gaming site to generate buzz for the project.
Some bad news, I found out the hard way that Twitch.tv doesnt archive your old streams unless you specifiy it so many of the previous streams have been deleted :(. At least most of the work was focused on the trailer and not the game proper so it wasnt too important. Good to know from now on though.
UPDATE APR 27 Character 2 model nearly complete -----------

working hard on the model for the second character Donny Matchstick. He should be done by May 1.
I am going to be shooting a live action portion of the teaser trailer next Friday. If you are going to be in Vancouver on May 4th come down to the VFS game design campus at 4:00pm to join in and get hype!
 
UPDATE APR 19  Reggie is ready ------------------------------

The model of our first character, Regicide, is complete and in engine. He seems pretty happy about it. I hit my target time estimates pretty well; he took about 24 hours to get to this state. 
Next up is animation...
 
UPDATE APR 17  Answering some questions -------------------
I want to answer some questions that have come up a lot lately. If you have a question please ask me at miggsthejust@gmail.com
F.A.Q.
Who are you and why would I give you money?
I am a game designer who has been working in the industry for 7 years now. During that time I have been a developer on 3 indie projects in varying roles:
Once Upon a Time - Role: Combat designer/Level designer
Super RPG Boss Battle Master (coming soon) - Role: Scripter/Game designer
DrumSkulls (unreleased) - Role: Level designer/Game designer
In addition to working on game projects I have been an instructor of game design at Vancouver Film School game design program. There I taught classes in game mechanics (awarded best course by students) and level design as well as mentored over 50 student final projects (basically 3 month game projects). 
I have a strong background in fighting games, playing for many years and running many tournaments and ranbats in the vancouver area. 
This project is a labor of love for me. I have been working towards this for many years and I am at a point in my career where I have the understanding to create a strong game design and implement it effectively.
If you have reservations about contributing based on my experience or understanding I urge you to watch the live stream at twitch.tv/miggsthejust to see how I work and even ask me any questions you might have.
Why are you creating this by yourself?
This isnt entirely true, I am the project lead and will be handling a majority of the work, but I will be contracting several key pieces of the project. I will be contracting the design of the interface and menus out to another designer as well as the music of the game. These contracts are factored into the contribution goal.
What I dont want is to talk people into working on this game for free. I've worked on many projects where this was the case and not only is it a disservice to the talent these guys have, it also puts a lot of pressure on the project to generate a lot of money just to cover backpay. I'd rather not end up in that situation again.
I feel I've been able to scope this project so that it is manageable with my personal skillset, and I will be able to deliver an engaging, well built game on time based on the project budget. That being said, if we are able to raise beyond the project goal, I will be seriously considering bringing more talent on board to make the final game even more polished.
$18000 seems a little odd, where does the money go?
$18000 is the number I determined would be a realistic project budget for the timeline and quality I am looking to achieve. Let me break it down a bit:
Indiegogo 4% cut - $720 (if I raise the full amount, if not $1620)
Contributor Perk costs - $1500 
Monthly Development costs for 8 month dev cycle - $1400 ($11200 total)
Pay for Contract work - $5000
These are rounded numbers and dont necessarily take into account the odds and ends fees that tend to come up. I feel it is a reasonable budget for a project of this size. Please email me if you have any further questions about the budget, I'm completely open to answering them.
What happens if we dont reach the project goal?
The Indiegogo flexible funding system works a little different than Kickstarter in that if the project goal isnt reached by the deadline the project will still receive the money raised.
That being said, if we dont raise the full $18000 amount I Promise to contact each contributor directly and ask them if they want the money sent back. It is fully up to you. I will still be giving out all the perks that have been promised and I will still use all of the money raised to finance the game project. I will still be developing the game, but it will either be scoped down or will be delayed until I can raise money from other sources or finish the game as a part time project.
What happens if we pass the project goal?
If the campaign is able to raise above the $18000 goal, I will move the project forward into some of the stretch goals planned for the game. Integrating GGPO netcode into the online play is a major one. Hiring on more developers in order to increase the character count to 6 is another.
What is Unique about EXPO Fighter
Expo Fighter is a traditional 2D fighter and in that vein I didn't want to reinvent the wheel when it came to the general game system. That being said, the ability to chain EX attacks together to allow for custom supers and the meter costing parry system are both improvements that I believe will give the gameplay a fresh feel, and will engage fighting game fans.
But Remember this is a game where you play as the President of Nintendo piledriving the President of Sony into the pavement! The game is full of E3 inspired insanity and that alone will make it a hilarious experience.
I don't like your perks, can I have something else?
In short, Yes! I want to create perks that will get people excited about helping out. If there's something you want to see, let me know and I'll do my best to make it happen.
------------------------------------------------------

ROUND 1: FIGHT!
Hello Internets, my name is Justin Meagher and I have been designing and instructing the design of video games for seven years here in Vancouver,BC. Recently I was laid off from one of the big companies in town and I decided this would be a chance for me to fulfill a game design dream I have had for a while now; create a fighting game. 
I have been playing fighters since I was nine years old playing at the corner hockey card shop and fighting games have been a major influence on the way I approach designing games. For a while now I have been refining a design for a fighter, developing an interesting theme, and researching the tech involved. Now seems like the perfect time to move forward.
The problem of course comes down to money as always, and that's where YOU can have a huge influence. My goal is to raise 18000$ dollars over the coming few months to finance the development of a small web browser based fighting game. The majority of this amount is to cover development expenses while working full time on the project. If I am not able to reach this goal I will probably have to put a halt on the work until I can generate the funding which will probably mean the game will not be released on time. I need your help on this one.
ROUND 2: EXPO FIGHTER
I am looking to create a web browser based fighting game to be released by June 1st 2013. The game is tentatively titled EXPO Fighter and it parodies the silliness surrounding the large video game expo's and announcements by pitting major game company exec inspired characters against one another. 
The game features 2D gameplay with 3D graphics similar to Street Fighter 4 or Mortal Kombat 9, and will be released with 3 fully playable characters to start. The game will support local multiplayer and will have fully featured online play. I plan to have an individual online ranking system in place along with a faction based ranking system so that players can battle it out to see who wins the console wars once and for all.
There are some interesting gameplay systems planned and over the course of the month I am going to be talking in depth about them. If you wish you will also be able to see and take part in the development process itself.
ROUND 3: THE LIVE STREAM
This is somewhat of an iron man challenge for me; designing, coding, and creating the art for a fighting game in 1 year! So I thought this would be an interesting way to open up the game creation process and let you see how I go about this project. 
Starting April 1st I am going to begin live streaming my work on this game in its entirety. Each night I will alternate working on the design, the scripting, or the art of the game and live stream it for anyone to watch. If you want to learn about the process, if you are interested in fighting games, or if you just want to come make fun of me you can check out the insanity at twitch.tv/miggsthejust!
YOU WIN! PERFECT!
Thank you so much for taking the time to read over this pitch, I really appreciate it. I am very excited to attempt this project and you can make it all possible with your support. Feel free to email me at miggsthejust@gmail.com if you have any questions about the project. 
There are going to be a lot of updates over the coming month, follow me on twitter @expofighter to keep up with the development.
--------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Expo Fighter is still very early in development, but let's go over some of the currently planned mechanics.
BASICS
Much of Expo Fighters gameplay follows the standard format of traditional 2D fighters: players choose one of a selection of characters and attempt to knockout the opposing players character by reducing their health gauge to zero. By default a player needs to do this 2 out of three times to win the game.
Expo Fighter uses a set of directional buttons/keys and a four button/key attack layout.

Throws are executed with the two light attacks.
Each character has a set of unique standard attacks and special attacks.
GENERAL FEEL
I'm attempting to create a fighter that I don't feel exists in the current market, a game with strongly defined character match-ups but gives the player the freedom to freestyle within those defined boundaries.
Movement speeds will be fast overall and hit stun will be high in general to allow for players to create a strong offense. At the same time smart defense and good reads will have strong rewards.
I like the purity of a meterless fighter such as SF2 Hyper Fighting but I also think there is a lot of strategic possibilities in meter management. I'm attempting to create a nice middle ground allowing for a flexible meter management game without it overwhelming the fundamental game.
HYPE GAUGE
Players generate hype by connecting attacks and successfully blocking attacks. Hype charges the hype gauge up to four levels. These levels can then be spent offensively or defensively to gain a stronger advantage. Unused hype stays stored in between game rounds.
HYPE ATTACKS
Players can spend a hype gauge level to turn a special attack into a hype attack. Hype gives an attack new properties such as increased hit stun, overhead properties, or invincibility frames.
One unique aspect of Hype attacks is that many of them can be chained together into a combo if the player wishes to spend the hype gauge. This allows players flexible options to increase damage or create pressure.
DENIALS
Players can choose to spend a hype gauge level to parry an incoming attack. The player simply taps forward for high attacks or down for low attacks at the point of contact to resist the damage and leave yourself at an advantage.
Once an attack is successfully denied the player may continue to parry attacks at no hype cost until a specific frame window has passed. This allows parrying to have a cost associated while still allowing a skilled player to benefit from making a good read.

Harness the tools and techniques of Rapid DNA Prototyping to
build your own sophisticated genetic circuits. This powerful set
of modular parts enables you to determine your own complex
projects. The power of synthetic biology has never been so
accessible!














DNA Tinker Studio explodes at SXSW 2015 in Austin! Panel with Synbiota CEO Connor Dickie, Director of the MIT Media Lab Joi Ito, Inventor of ""Moore's Law for Biotech"" Rob Carlson, and UPenn School of Fine Art Professor Orkan Telhan.






Use DNA Tinker Studio to design, build and grow microbes that fluoresce!



Use DNA Tinker Studio to design, build and grow microbes that turns simple sugar into medically important compounds like Violacein!


Even use DNA Tinker Studio to design, build and grow a living thermometer that senses the temperature and lets you know how hot it is by smell. And that's just the beginning! 







With many incredible possibilities for what you can create, this kit
is not only the most accessible Life Science learning tool available, it’s
a powerful collection of parts ready to be used immediately in
your research lab.

					
































DNA Tinker Studio is a collection of 59 Rapid DNA Prototyping (RDP)
Standardized parts which allow you to quickly and reliably build a great
deal of biotechnology projects. 





DNA Tinker Studio includes all the parts from our prior kits (Rainbow Factory, Violacein Factory, & Hello World) ​— p​lus a
handful of new parts that allow advanced users incredible flexibility.


With this collection you have the freedom
to build sophisticated genetic circuits that can sense and react according to your choosing.



Design a genetic circuit that includes a wide array of
regulators, including fixed or tunable promoters,
operators with activators or repressors, and plasmid
backbones with different copy numbers.Use different producers and product modifiers,
including the components of the Violacein and Lux
operons, chromophores, scents, cleavable and
non-­cleavable protein linkers

— a​nd more!


















With Synbiota, virtual and physical are harmonized as genetic 
designs translate seamlessly from the computer to the petri dish


Synbiota's integrated suite of software and wetware solutions empowers you to create your own genetic constructs with unparalleled speed and reliability.






 








""An exciting hands-on tool to introduce
 artists and designers to the world of synthetic biology. Elements of 
the kit are well designed and simple to use. A great example of allowing
 people to think about biological components as potential media for 
visual and design processes. Well done!""
- Raphael Kim, Royal College of Art, London, UK.
""It’s a great way to introduce people 
with no science background to the principles of synthetic biology. At 
Genspace we use it for outreach events such as science and technology 
fairs, and also for teaching classes to the general public.""- Ellen Jorgensen, Genspace NYC http://genspace.org/ 
""One word: awesome! At MadLab, we've 
used Synbiota in a workshop context – that you can take a roomful of 
amateur biologists, with little or no laboratory experience, and have 
them building custom genetic constructs within a matter of hours is 
incredible; inconceivable only a few years ago and a testimony to the 
achievements of the Synbiota team.""

- Asa Calow, Manchester Digital Labratory http://madlab.org.uk/
""The whole bead concept is quite 
brilliant and presents countless potential opportunities to customize 
the genetic engineering lab for different students/groups and allow them
 to develop and test their own hypotheses in experiments of their 
design. The method is easy for students to follow, and they found it 
very stimulating.""

- Tim Gannon,        AP Biology Teacher, Tempo School http://temposchool.org/  
""Disruptively simple, robust and effective""
- FBI Biological Countermeasures Unit
""Thank you so much for your dedication and guidance, and - most importantly - thank you for inspiring a new way of thinking about making that will enter our every project from now on.

<p>Game of Engines is a small application that allows everyone to create their very own game. This application includes a level editor, asset manager and game engine so all you need to do is add some graphics and functionality to create the game you have always wanted.</p>
<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Who is Game Of Engines For?</span></strong></h2>
<p>Game of Engines is for everyone. It is simple enough that a child could use it but powerful enough for a developer to. Our unique level editor is perfectly suited to your game's needs - It has everything you need to make ANY kind of game: Platformer, RPG, Side-Scroller, Arcade... The list goes on.</p>
<p><img alt=""Game Of Engines running on Mac"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://media.indiedb.com/cache/images/engines/1/1/457/thumb_620x2000/Screen_Shot_2013-02-19_at_12.34.05.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Game Of Engines V1.2""/></p>
<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Who's Behind Game Of Engines?</span></strong></h2>
<p>That would be me. My name is Matt and I am a software programmer from England. I started work on Game Of Engines around 2 years ago when I realised that Game Maker and RPG Maker didn't have the functionality I needed to create my dream game. With this in mind, I set off on a 2 year quest to create a fantastic Game Engine that would run MY game - This engine is called Light Engine.</p>
<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What Is Light Engine?</span></strong></h2>
<p>I don't want to get too complex here but Light Engine is a powerful 2D engine I created to run games created in GoE. Light Engine is powered by YOUR lua scripts and contains some of the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast Launch Time -  Game Of Engines loads your game in real time so you don't have to sit through annoying load screens.</li>
<li>Amazing Collision Detection - Our engine can detect even the slightest of collisions (even a feather lightly floating by a leaf)</li>
<li>Brilliant Physics - Our Lua-Physics add on allows you to create game's with amazing physics potential - Now you can finally add that scene where your main character runs up walls and jumps from bridges.</li>
<li>Smooth Graphics - We use our own png resource loader and drawing systems so that your games look and render smoothly.</li>
<li>Great Cross-Platform Action - Game Of Engines runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, PSVita, DS and the Sega Dreamcast so you can play your game anywhere. We are also working on a iPhone and Android version.</li>
<li>No Strict Rules - Game Of Engines will never tell you what to do, you can make anything and everything from scratch or templates.</li>
<li>No Programming - Despite what our hastily made Intro Video shows, you don't even need a keyboard to create a game. Our objects come with Components so you can just add the functionality you need without scripting.</li>
<li>No Third Party Software - 99% of our Toolkit is homebrewed so you only need to use 3rd Party Applications if YOU want to. If not then feel free to use our custom File Editor, Asset Manager and Action Panels.</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What We Need And What You Get</span></strong></h2>
<p>Game Of Engines is still in early alpha and despite all the features listed above are ALREADY implemented, we still need to enhance the Toolkit further and get it fully working. I have never done this for the money but I have now reached a point in which I need some to progress with this work. This project needs money for all kinds of development (and distribution) licenses for Qt, Apple, PlayStation Mobile and loads of other software. In addition, we also need money for help with marketing and design so that we can continue to bring you great features.</p>
<p>Our fund goal is 4,000 - This will be enough for a number of licenses and some research development. I would NEVER EVER ask for money to fund this project but Kickstarter allows me to give you something in return - A complete Game Development Toolkit with everything you need to create a killer game.</p>
<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Community</span></strong></h2>
<p>There are other ways you can help this project progress. Our biggest source of info right now is our Twitter page: <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/evilwatersuk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.twitter.com/evilwatersuk</a> and by following us, you can have the chance to win FREE ALPHA ACCESS in our giveaways every month.</p>
<p>You can also help us by simply telling other people about this project. If you have a friend/Uncle/Nephew/Son/Daughter who would be interested in making their own game then please send them this way.</p>

<p>If you would like more information or news on the Game Of Engines project then we very strongly recommend checking out our indiedb page (<a href=""http://www.indiedb.com/engines/game-of-engines"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.indiedb.com/engines/game-of-engines</a>). This page is essentially a journal that we have been updating for the past 2 years on information from the Toolkit. In Addition, this page also houses loads of brilliant screenshots of GoE.</p>
<h2><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What's Next</span></strong></h2>
<p>With the money raised here, I hope to buy all the licenses we need and implement loads of cool new features to GoE such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Marketplace - A store where you can publish and even sell games you have created using the engine. This is something we have been planning for a while but as of yet do not have the funding.</li>
<li>Art Assets - I would like to hire somebody to draw up some simple art assets that we can use in examples for launch.</li>
<li>A Rest - If we by some chance exceed our funding goal then I would love to either hire some help with programming or call in a few friends to help out.</li>
</ul><p>On a final note, I would like to say thank you all for taking the time to view this project and if by chance we manage to exceed our funding goal then for every £100 we exceed, I will knock £10 from the Market Price for everyone.</p>

I don't want to get too complex here but Light Engine is a powerful 2D engine I created to run games created in GoE. Light Engine is powered by YOUR lua scripts and contains some of the following features:

Fast Launch Time -  Game Of Engines loads your game in real time so you don't have to sit through annoying load screens.
Amazing Collision Detection - Our engine can detect even the slightest of collisions (even a feather lightly floating by a leaf)
Brilliant Physics - Our Lua-Physics add on allows you to create game's with amazing physics potential - Now you can finally add that scene where your main character runs up walls and jumps from bridges.
Smooth Graphics - We use our own png resource loader and drawing systems so that your games look and render smoothly.
Great Cross-Platform Action - Game Of Engines runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, PSVita, DS and the Sega Dreamcast so you can play your game anywhere. We are also working on a iPhone and Android version.
No Strict Rules - Game Of Engines will never tell you what to do, you can make anything and everything from scratch or templates.
No Programming - Despite what our hastily made Intro Video shows, you don't even need a keyboard to create a game. Our objects come with Components so you can just add the functionality you need without scripting.
No Third Party Software - 99% of our Toolkit is homebrewed so you only need to use 3rd Party Applications if YOU want to. If not then feel free to use our custom File Editor, Asset Manager and Action Panels.
 
What We Need And What You Get
Game Of Engines is still in early alpha and despite all the features listed above are ALREADY implemented, we still need to enhance the Toolkit further and get it fully working. I have never done this for the money but I have now reached a point in which I need some to progress with this work. This project needs money for all kinds of development (and distribution) licenses for Qt, Apple, PlayStation Mobile and loads of other software. In addition, we also need money for help with marketing and design so that we can continue to bring you great features.
Our fund goal is 4,000 - This will be enough for a number of licenses and some research development. I would NEVER EVER ask for money to fund this project but Kickstarter allows me to give you something in return - A complete Game Development Toolkit with everything you need to create a killer game.
Community
There are other ways you can help this project progress. Our biggest source of info right now is our Twitter page: http://www.twitter.com/evilwatersuk and by following us, you can have the chance to win FREE ALPHA ACCESS in our giveaways every month.
You can also help us by simply telling other people about this project. If you have a friend/Uncle/Nephew/Son/Daughter who would be interested in making their own game then please send them this way.

News And Info
If you would like more information or news on the Game Of Engines project then we very strongly recommend checking out our indiedb page (http://www.indiedb.com/engines/game-of-engines). This page is essentially a journal that we have been updating for the past 2 years on information from the Toolkit. In Addition, this page also houses loads of brilliant screenshots of GoE.
What's Next
With the money raised here, I hope to buy all the licenses we need and implement loads of cool new features to GoE such as:

The Marketplace - A store where you can publish and even sell games you have created using the engine. This is something we have been planning for a while but as of yet do not have the funding.
Art Assets - I would like to hire somebody to draw up some simple art assets that we can use in examples for launch.
A Rest - If we by some chance exceed our funding goal then I would love to either hire some help with programming or call in a few friends to help out.
On a final note, I would like to say thank you all for taking the time to view this project and if by chance we manage to exceed our funding goal then for every £100 we exceed, I will knock £10 from the Market Price for everyone.

<h1 style=""color: #666666;"">Update:</h1>
<p style=""font-size: medium; color: #777777;"">In our previous campaign efforts we have raised over $3,600.00 so far! Thanks to all the new contributors! Our design forums on the Thrones of Valor site are starting to buzz. Already our supporters have come up with great ideas that are now part of the game description below! Please jump in and support this game so we can keep on it full time, and so you can get involved with the player and developer community right away!</p>
<h1 style=""color: #666666;"">The Game</h1>
<p style=""font-size: medium; color: #777777;"">Can you imagine what it would be like to be part of a massive fantasy metaverse, where there were no NPCs, no quests, and no AI, but where all of the day in and day out tasks and socializing and battling were planned and carried out by groups of real people? This is the essence of Thrones of Valor™</p>
<p style=""font-size: medium; color: #777777;"">Will you choose to be a King or a Queen? A Knight of Valor? A Lord of the Realm? A Steward of the Village? An Innkeeper? A Landowner? Or A Peasant? The choice is yours.</p>
<p style=""font-size: medium; color: #777777;"">Will you spend your time planning and carrying out fierce battles for realm territory? Or will you help your fellow citizens plan and improve realm life? Will you spend time thrown in the dungeon for treason? Or will you peddle merchandise or ale and be a friend to all? It's up to you.</p>
<p style=""font-size: medium; color: #777777;"">The game of Thrones of Valor is about realm versus realm battling. It's about winning or losing territory. It's about forming guilds and raid parties and having sophisticated ways of holding secret meetings to plan strategy. It's about trading goods, abilities, equipment, and gold. And it's about socializing, forming relationships with your fellow citizens, realm diplomacy, and even collecting intelligence on the enemy.<br/><br/> The thread running through all of this is our philosophy of offering the community brilliant graphics, immersive music and sound effects, powerful communication tools such as video, audio and text chat, flexible systems for trading, and ways to constantly improve your characters, while leaving the ""HOW"", to you. You have the world and the tools, yet you will have to decide along with your fellow citizens of the realm, how you will conduct yourselves and play the game.</p>

<h1 style=""color: #666666;"">""How is Thrones of Valor Special?""</h1>
<h3 style=""color: #666666;"">It's All Real People</h3>
<p style=""font-size: medium; color: #777777;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d32ecwo413jnjy.cloudfront.net/tovimages/real-people-flat.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/> Let's think of how this is special. The game is Realm vs. Realm battle for territory. It's also day in and day out living in a fantasy metaverse. The Realm is run by a King or Queen (see the perks!) The Realm has a palace, and a number of Knights of Valor. In the Realm are a number of villages. Each village is run by a Lord. The Lord has a Steward who aids in running the village. There are Innkeepers, Merchants and Villagers who may or may not own Dwellings of their own.</p>
<p style=""font-size: medium; color: #777777;"">Your Realm Monarch will want to gain territory, or protect what is the Realm's. He or she will hold LIVE VIDEO MEETINGS with his Knights of Valor. Strategies will be planned. Then communiques will be sent to all the Lords of the Realm, who then will hold LIVE VIDEO MEETINGS with villagers. Village raid or protection strategies will be planned and employed.</p>
<p style=""font-size: medium; color: #777777;"">From this one scenario, you can see how different and special this MMORTS is. It's people, working and planning with people. It's powerful communication tools used to form and execute plans. It's NOT the normal MMORTS where you play as the god of your nation moving around groups of little AI armies, going head to head with other players' nations. Instead it's you working with other citizens, all making plans and working together to get the job done for your Realm. In other words it's much more like REAL LIFE. Real nations. You are building a nation with other real people. How well your realm, your government functions is up to all people involved.</p>
<h3 style=""color: #666666;"">It's a Unique Style of Gameplay</h3>
<p style=""font-size: medium; color: #777777;"">Thrones of Valor employs rich, isometric 3D graphics, music, and sound effects to provide an immersive experience in an enjoyable fantasy world. Isometric 3D is formed from pre-rendered 2D graphics, so any video card will work brilliantly.</p>
<p style=""font-size: medium; color: #777777;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d32ecwo413jnjy.cloudfront.net/tovimages/Card%20Back.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d32ecwo413jnjy.cloudfront.net/tovimages/Elvish%20Sword.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/> When you go on planned raids to conquer neighboring villages, it won't be the normal hack and slash. You will find enemies and challenge them to a battle. However the battle will take the form of your character versus their character using a hybrid d20/TCG-style RPG rules. You'll have stats, and a TCG-style deck of cards you can use to draw from and activate certain equipment, weapons, abilities and stat buffs the way you see fit. Then you'll take turns rolling to hit, rolling damage, and choosing actions, just like you would in any d20 game. When the battle is finished, one person will emerge victorious. No hard feelings, just great d20 battle fun.</p>
<p style=""font-size: medium; color: #777777;"">So while the game has the feel of a normal MMO video game, you battle and decide actions in a paper/pen RPG form. Our fans say they can't wait to try this new play style. Neither can we!</p>
<h3 style=""color: #666666;"">You Choose How You Spend Your Time</h3>
<p style=""font-size: medium; color: #777777;"">Even though the main combat goal of the game is to protect your territory and possibly expand it, we want our citizens to feel that they can spend their time playing any way they like.</p>
<p style=""font-size: medium; color: #777777;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d32ecwo413jnjy.cloudfront.net/tovimages/cabbages2.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/> If you like battling realm vs. realm and spending time working out raid strategy, then by all means do that! However if you want to focus on forming relationships in the realm community, roleplaying to your heart's desire, planning to make village life better for other citizens, then feel free! With trading systems, video and voice chat for avatars, the ability to own and decorate your own cottage, manor or castle, and then meet groups of people there by invitation only, you have a powerful means to live a social life in Thrones of Valor.</p>
<p style=""font-size: medium; color: #777777;"">And of course you can mix it up, and spend time in all the different ways you can think of. It's your world, your life, you lead it!</p>
<h3 style=""color: #666666;"">There are new Technology Features Uncommon to the MMORTS</h3>
<ul style=""font-size: medium; color: #777777;"">
<li>Avatar-Proximity Video &amp; Voice Chat. If a group of you approach each other, you'll be connected by text, voice, or even video! Of course you have option settings to control how this works for you. <br/>  </li>
<li>
<img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d32ecwo413jnjy.cloudfront.net/tovimages/cottage_02_90.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/> Setting dwelling interior security allows you to hold live-video meetings with players inside your dwelling, from guild members, to friends, and on to individual players by invitation only. You'll use this feature both for pure fun, and for holding secret meetings to plan strategy.<br/>  </li>
<li>Enhanced email and text notifications for raids, meetings and get-togethers. Imagine receiving an email or text reminding you of a pending raid you've planned to attend. Or notifying you that your village or a neighboring village is being attacked so you can jump online and help defend her with all your might. Because of the ""All Real People"" nature of the game, our communication and notification systems have to be best-of-class.<br/>  </li>
<li>A macro scripting language you can use to control what your character is doing while you're away from the game! Our players have asked for this feature so that they can still be productive while away from the game (for example when real life intervenes.) Set your character to patrol the walls and attack raiders. Or set your character to mine for precious metals or other resources. The options will be many.</li>

<h1 style=""color: #666666;"">How is Gamesabi Special?</h1>
<p style=""font-size: medium; color: #777777;"">The designers and developers at Gamesabi have a track record of successfully building and boot-strapping large, unique, commercially available game software.</p>
<p style=""font-size: medium; color: #777777;"">As a part of Universal Online Magic, LLC, we have built iTabletop: a powerful online virtual tabletop that focuses on using rich media, maps, tokens, and live video and voice chat to reproduce the feel of your group of friends being around the game table, even though you're playing online remotely.</p>
<p style=""font-size: medium; color: #777777;"">iTabletop was the first ""VTT"" to be group webcam-centered, and have a style of using rich media to do immersive storytelling for the RPG.</p>
<p style=""font-size: medium; color: #777777;"">iTabletop was also crowdfunded and built from the ground up, and in fact, Thrones of Valor represents a major feature addition to iTabletop, using the same Silverlight-based game platform code base reloaded to handle an MMO and RTS environment. As a result of Thrones of Valor, iTabletop is now receiving an isometric 3D face lift by Gamesabi, so iTabletop customers can build their games to look like off-the-shelf 3D video games, while retaining all the flexibility that iTabletop is known for.</p>
<p style=""font-size: medium; color: #777777;"">All this to make the point that Gamesabi has a history of being able to build large projects like Thrones of Valor, and additionally that Thrones of Valor has a huge jump start since it is being built on top of the iTabletop code base. For more information please read the Deep Dive: The Technology section at the bottom of this page!</p>

<h1 style=""color: #666666;"">The Pay Model</h1>
<p style=""font-size: medium; color: #777777;"">Thrones of Valor is free to play. Gamesabi will make money selling in-game digital content such as character and costume upgrades, in-game real estate, buff-packs, etc., none of which are necessary to play and have fun. This is a popular trend used by many MMOs such as LOTRO, D&amp;D Online, and others. Players have the ability to jump in and play as much and as often as they like, and only purchase those things that they decide will significantly impact their own style of play.</p>

<h1 style=""color: #666666;"">Our Game-Design Philosophy</h1>

<li>We believe in games that foster the maximum in emergent behavior, so that you, the players, end up coming up with ways to play that we never imagined.<br/>  </li>
<li>It's a powerful thing to create a new community of people having fun and being challenged and creating social connections, and we take this commitment and responsibility seriously. We desire to make this game a reality, just as we made iTabletop a reality and continue to expand and improve it on a regular basis.</li>

</tbody></table></div>","Update:
In our previous campaign efforts we have raised over $3,600.00 so far! Thanks to all the new contributors! Our design forums on the Thrones of Valor site are starting to buzz. Already our supporters have come up with great ideas that are now part of the game description below! Please jump in and support this game so we can keep on it full time, and so you can get involved with the player and developer community right away!
The Game
Can you imagine what it would be like to be part of a massive fantasy metaverse, where there were no NPCs, no quests, and no AI, but where all of the day in and day out tasks and socializing and battling were planned and carried out by groups of real people? This is the essence of Thrones of Valor™
Will you choose to be a King or a Queen? A Knight of Valor? A Lord of the Realm? A Steward of the Village? An Innkeeper? A Landowner? Or A Peasant? The choice is yours.
Will you spend your time planning and carrying out fierce battles for realm territory? Or will you help your fellow citizens plan and improve realm life? Will you spend time thrown in the dungeon for treason? Or will you peddle merchandise or ale and be a friend to all? It's up to you.
The game of Thrones of Valor is about realm versus realm battling. It's about winning or losing territory. It's about forming guilds and raid parties and having sophisticated ways of holding secret meetings to plan strategy. It's about trading goods, abilities, equipment, and gold. And it's about socializing, forming relationships with your fellow citizens, realm diplomacy, and even collecting intelligence on the enemy. The thread running through all of this is our philosophy of offering the community brilliant graphics, immersive music and sound effects, powerful communication tools such as video, audio and text chat, flexible systems for trading, and ways to constantly improve your characters, while leaving the ""HOW"", to you. You have the world and the tools, yet you will have to decide along with your fellow citizens of the realm, how you will conduct yourselves and play the game.




""How is Thrones of Valor Special?""
It's All Real People
 Let's think of how this is special. The game is Realm vs. Realm battle for territory. It's also day in and day out living in a fantasy metaverse. The Realm is run by a King or Queen (see the perks!) The Realm has a palace, and a number of Knights of Valor. In the Realm are a number of villages. Each village is run by a Lord. The Lord has a Steward who aids in running the village. There are Innkeepers, Merchants and Villagers who may or may not own Dwellings of their own.
Your Realm Monarch will want to gain territory, or protect what is the Realm's. He or she will hold LIVE VIDEO MEETINGS with his Knights of Valor. Strategies will be planned. Then communiques will be sent to all the Lords of the Realm, who then will hold LIVE VIDEO MEETINGS with villagers. Village raid or protection strategies will be planned and employed.
From this one scenario, you can see how different and special this MMORTS is. It's people, working and planning with people. It's powerful communication tools used to form and execute plans. It's NOT the normal MMORTS where you play as the god of your nation moving around groups of little AI armies, going head to head with other players' nations. Instead it's you working with other citizens, all making plans and working together to get the job done for your Realm. In other words it's much more like REAL LIFE. Real nations. You are building a nation with other real people. How well your realm, your government functions is up to all people involved.
It's a Unique Style of Gameplay
Thrones of Valor employs rich, isometric 3D graphics, music, and sound effects to provide an immersive experience in an enjoyable fantasy world. Isometric 3D is formed from pre-rendered 2D graphics, so any video card will work brilliantly.
 When you go on planned raids to conquer neighboring villages, it won't be the normal hack and slash. You will find enemies and challenge them to a battle. However the battle will take the form of your character versus their character using a hybrid d20/TCG-style RPG rules. You'll have stats, and a TCG-style deck of cards you can use to draw from and activate certain equipment, weapons, abilities and stat buffs the way you see fit. Then you'll take turns rolling to hit, rolling damage, and choosing actions, just like you would in any d20 game. When the battle is finished, one person will emerge victorious. No hard feelings, just great d20 battle fun.
So while the game has the feel of a normal MMO video game, you battle and decide actions in a paper/pen RPG form. Our fans say they can't wait to try this new play style. Neither can we!
You Choose How You Spend Your Time
Even though the main combat goal of the game is to protect your territory and possibly expand it, we want our citizens to feel that they can spend their time playing any way they like.
 If you like battling realm vs. realm and spending time working out raid strategy, then by all means do that! However if you want to focus on forming relationships in the realm community, roleplaying to your heart's desire, planning to make village life better for other citizens, then feel free! With trading systems, video and voice chat for avatars, the ability to own and decorate your own cottage, manor or castle, and then meet groups of people there by invitation only, you have a powerful means to live a social life in Thrones of Valor.
And of course you can mix it up, and spend time in all the different ways you can think of. It's your world, your life, you lead it!
There are new Technology Features Uncommon to the MMORTS

Avatar-Proximity Video & Voice Chat. If a group of you approach each other, you'll be connected by text, voice, or even video! Of course you have option settings to control how this works for you.   

 Setting dwelling interior security allows you to hold live-video meetings with players inside your dwelling, from guild members, to friends, and on to individual players by invitation only. You'll use this feature both for pure fun, and for holding secret meetings to plan strategy.  
Enhanced email and text notifications for raids, meetings and get-togethers. Imagine receiving an email or text reminding you of a pending raid you've planned to attend. Or notifying you that your village or a neighboring village is being attacked so you can jump online and help defend her with all your might. Because of the ""All Real People"" nature of the game, our communication and notification systems have to be best-of-class.  
A macro scripting language you can use to control what your character is doing while you're away from the game! Our players have asked for this feature so that they can still be productive while away from the game (for example when real life intervenes.) Set your character to patrol the walls and attack raiders. Or set your character to mine for precious metals or other resources. The options will be many.





How is Gamesabi Special?
The designers and developers at Gamesabi have a track record of successfully building and boot-strapping large, unique, commercially available game software.
As a part of Universal Online Magic, LLC, we have built iTabletop: a powerful online virtual tabletop that focuses on using rich media, maps, tokens, and live video and voice chat to reproduce the feel of your group of friends being around the game table, even though you're playing online remotely.
iTabletop was the first ""VTT"" to be group webcam-centered, and have a style of using rich media to do immersive storytelling for the RPG.
iTabletop was also crowdfunded and built from the ground up, and in fact, Thrones of Valor represents a major feature addition to iTabletop, using the same Silverlight-based game platform code base reloaded to handle an MMO and RTS environment. As a result of Thrones of Valor, iTabletop is now receiving an isometric 3D face lift by Gamesabi, so iTabletop customers can build their games to look like off-the-shelf 3D video games, while retaining all the flexibility that iTabletop is known for.
All this to make the point that Gamesabi has a history of being able to build large projects like Thrones of Valor, and additionally that Thrones of Valor has a huge jump start since it is being built on top of the iTabletop code base. For more information please read the Deep Dive: The Technology section at the bottom of this page!




The Pay Model
Thrones of Valor is free to play. Gamesabi will make money selling in-game digital content such as character and costume upgrades, in-game real estate, buff-packs, etc., none of which are necessary to play and have fun. This is a popular trend used by many MMOs such as LOTRO, D&D Online, and others. Players have the ability to jump in and play as much and as often as they like, and only purchase those things that they decide will significantly impact their own style of play.




Our Game-Design Philosophy

We at Gamesabi feel passionately about building a large online community that has powerful tools to play, and yet has the choice to play the way they desire to play.   
We believe in games that foster the maximum in emergent behavior, so that you, the players, end up coming up with ways to play that we never imagined.  
It's a powerful thing to create a new community of people having fun and being challenged and creating social connections, and we take this commitment and responsibility seriously. We desire to make this game a reality, just as we made iTabletop a reality and continue to expand and improve it on a regular basis.





""How Will My Money Be Used?""
The money you provide will go toward:

Expanding and improving the iTabletop game platform to build out Thrones of Valor functionality.  
Detailing and refining the Thrones of Valor game design with your help, so we end up with a game that is thrilling and unique to play.  
Purchasing 3D modeling and rendering assets, in-game music and sound effects licensing, and all the other assets that make up a graphical video game.  
Composing and rendering isometric 3D exterior village maps, dwelling and dungeon interior maps, and animated character avatars with a wide variety of body and clothing styles.  
Covering the monthly costs of the game development. We work to keep this low by working virtually from our home offices and not having to pay for an office lease, but we do pay for our server infrastructure through Amazon.com, our business-level Internet connections, and other development necessities.  
Lean spending on marketing. We strive to keep this low as well, first by opting to use this crowdfunding system at IndieGoGo where we can simultaneously raise funding while at the same time build up our initial player base through the perks we offer. We also work to keep marketing funding needs low by building the game to be more viral, whereby it becomes more fun to play when your friends play, so you naturally tell friends about the game and invite them to play for free.

""What Perks Will I Get?""

A fun and valuable perk that gives you something you can do Right Now, in the form of comparably-priced iTabletop Lifetime Accounts for use in RPG gaming, as well as in creating unique worlds to use for video chat and hanging out with friends and family.  
You also get valuable perks that you will put to use as soon as Thrones of Valor is complete. These perks give you ownership of medieval dwellings, special titles and status in the game, special abilities and duties, and one-of-a-kind upgrades that will never be available to people who did not support development of the game. Some Perks you'll see can even give you the ability to name your village or name your realm!  
Additionally all contributors get the ability to immediately join the Thrones of Valor player and developer community! You can jump in right now and get to know players and developers, by forum, text, voice, or video chat built right into the iTabletop software. Help shape the game starting right now.  
Guaranteed inclusion in the Thrones of Valor closed and open betas. Be among the first to play this game.  
Check the perks listed to the right for all the details!





""What if you have already raised your entire goal amount?""
If you find that we've already met our original goal, we ask that you still contribute funds to the effort, and join in and become part of this new kind of emerging MMO. Rising above our goal means we can purchase even more 3D content, music, and sound effects, and afford more labor to build the game, building more features into the game and significantly improving the experience for everyone involved.
As another caveat, additional funding will help us achieve our dream of releasing actual foil-wrapped TCG card packs in retail hobby and game stores! You've seen the TCGs that include serial numbers to unlock the cards online. Well that is a goal we can't wait to see a reality. Please help us blow away our goal amount so we can move forward with our entire vision.




Other Ways You Can Help
Of course spread the word to your friends! Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter. Email this campaign link to your friends! Help us find contributors!

<p>We're a company dedicated to providing video game streamers with awesome tools and features for their Twitch.tv channel. We believe that viewer interaction is very important when doing live content, and we aim to help make that happen.</p>
<p>The network has two main features, currency and ManaBot.</p>
<h1>Stream Currency</h1>
<p>Get something out of your viewing experience! Viewers can collect currency on their favorite streams that can then be used for in-game and out-of-game rewards or services. The way the system is setup is to reward those who are loyal and give new viewers something to ""work"" towards.</p>
<p><em>Always wanted to play a game of LoL with your favorite streamer, but you never get picked to go? Save up your currency and spend it on a viewer run with them!</em></p>
<p>Anybody can earn currency just from watching the stream, given out every 15 minutes. You can also obtain currency by making a donation to the stream (as little as $2 USD); allowing you to quickly that viewer run, in-game item, song request, etc.</p>
<h1>ManaBot</h1>
<p>All members on the network have access to our exclusive chat-bot, ManaBot. If you've ever watched a stream on Twitch, you probably know of NightBot and MooBot. ManaBot is basically the same thing, but has built-in features for network members. Viewers can look-up their currency, bid currency, enter raffles, gamble and more.</p>
<p>ManaBot also has custom command support  allowing streamers to automatically display certain text phrases when specified. Anti-link features are also in place for those who don't want links being posted in their chat.</p>
<p>One of the coolest features that ManaBot has is the gambling feature. Viewers can risk their currency against others in a couple of different ways. This allows for an addictive mini-game that can be played right in your chat, and also serves as a ""sink"" (pulling currency out of the economy). We've had lots of success and praise about this feature!</p>
<h1>The Website</h1>
<p>We offer many great features on the ManaPot website such as the ability to create and host <strong>raffles</strong>. Streamers can setup raffles (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Yearly) in which viewers can purchase entries to. This means that the more you watch a stream, the better your odds of winning are.</p>
<p><strong>Premium Membership</strong> is another feature that we offer. This option is for viewers who want to show their dedication to a stream, earning them a special flair next to their name (when displayed on the website), extra currency every 15 minutes and free raffle entries each week.</p>
<p>We're adding lots of new features to the website and overall system on a weekly basis.</p>
<h1>What are funds being used for?</h1>
<p>I'm mainly looking for funds so I can hire some additional programmers to help out. I have created and ran this project 100% by myself and it is getting to big for me to handle alone. Funds will also be used to pay for hosting services and other expenses occurred with running everything.</p>
<h1>Athene is down, are you?</h1>
<p>One of the main network members we have is someone you have all probably heard of, <strong>Athene</strong>. He contacted me a few weeks ago with interest for joining the program, and after a few Skype calls, is very eager to join. As he put it, this is ""<em>a million dollar idea and one of the best ideas to ever come to Twitch</em>"". You can see a short clip from one of his videos talking about the point / currency system by <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpzmREhqyf0&amp;t=0m40s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">clicking here</a>.</p>
<h1>How long has the network been active?</h1>
<p>I started working on The ManaPot Network around the end of March, so it's been up and running publicly for about one month now. I used the system for about four months myself before deciding to re-code everything from scratch to support multiple users.</p>
<p>In the one month that we've been live, we have generated nearly $3,000 in donations. A lot of streamers were barely bringing in any donations and have seen a <strong>huge </strong>increase ever since joining the network.</p>
<p>Money isn't everything though! Overall, viewers are pleased with the system and have been giving us lots of positive feedback about everything we have in place and features they would like to see. We believe that making the viewers happy is the most important aspect of the whole system and we're always striving to make that happen.</p>
<h1>Backer Rewards</h1>
<p>Unfortunately, we don't have a lot to offer those who back our project. You will notice that you get Premium Membership packages with each donation though (on the official ManaPot stream). I have even added a special membership package for backers who support this project a lot (Titanium), something that isn't obtainable any other way.</p>
<p>I hope this doesn't affect the support of this project too much, as it is a really great system. We want to help out the gaming community and make these services and features available to everybody interested, so please help us make that happen!</p></div>","What is The ManaPot Network?

<h3>What Gamerception Is</h3>
<p>Gamerception was an idea that was thought up by myself and a good friend of mine. We're both teens with big ideas and both of us have some experience developing simple websites but the complexity of this site and the amount of labor that will be needed to create it will require much larger funds.</p>
<p>Have you ever had a really great idea for a PC game? Maybe you've already made a PC game but don't know how or where to sell it. Or maybe you just want to find a good website to buy PC games from. With Gamerception you will be able to upload anything from a simple flash game to an advanced First Person Shooter game. And here's the best part: uploading a game will be absolutely FREE and you will get to keep 60 to 70% of your profits depending on how many sales you make.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Funds Needed</h3>
<p>We think that we will be able to complete our website in three phases: In Phase 1 we will need to raise at least $30,000 to get the website creation started. This should cover the initial price of the web designers and developers. In Phase 2 we will try and raise $30,000 more to cover the price the designers and developers charge. In Phase 3 we will have to raise between 30,000 and $40,000 to launch and maintain the website.</p>
<h3><strong>How Your Contribution Helps</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Your contribution can help in many ways! Even if you donate a small amount of money it still adds up in the long run and we will be very grateful.</p>
<p>My friend and I have some great connections when it comes to making websites and we'll find the right people to get the job done. Every cent of your contribution will be put to use in making Gamerception a reality.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Anyone Can Help</h3>
<p>Sam and I are aware that you may not be able to contribute, even if you would like to. But we want you to know that even if you cannot donate money you can still help us by getting the word out about Gamerception. You can help by ""liking"" our Facebook page or following us on Twitter. You can also help just by telling people you know about our project.</p>
<p>Thank you for your contribution!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

This should cover the initial price of the web designers and developers. In Phase 2 we will try and raise $30,000 more to cover the price the designers and developers charge. In Phase 3 we will have to raise between 30,000 and $40,000 to launch and maintain the website.
How Your Contribution Helps


Your contribution can help in many ways! Even if you donate a small amount of money it still adds up in the long run and we will be very grateful.
My friend and I have some great connections when it comes to making websites and we'll find the right people to get the job done. Every cent of your contribution will be put to use in making Gamerception a reality.


Anyone Can Help
Sam and I are aware that you may not be able to contribute, even if you would like to. But we want you to know that even if you cannot donate money you can still help us by getting the word out about Gamerception. You can help by ""liking"" our Facebook page or following us on Twitter. You can also help just by telling people you know about our project.
Thank you for your contribution!
Sincerely,

<p>We are making a PSA to help continue the dialogue about gun violence prevention in our society. This movement has gained legs in recent months, and we want to continue to push the issues forward to help make a positive difference. As both parents and filmmakers; our committment is to actively work towards improving the safety of our communities through the power of the visual medium.</p>
<p>We're not new to the production of a PSA. We’re excited to announce that our recent work, a PSA for raising awareness about domestic violence, was recently launched by the National Domestic Violence Hotline and continues to gain media exposure through press and awards recognition at the Addys. Here’s a link if you would like to read more: <a href=""http://bit.ly/TLtgqW"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://bit.ly/TLtgqW</a></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>WHY WE ARE FUNDRAISING:</strong></p>
<p>In order to ensure a PSA is taken seriously and seen by as many people as possible; we have to produce it with quality production values that will enable it to serve its function. Attaining that comes with a real price tag that is beyond our personal means. However, thankfully in the era of digital production, that price tag is now eminently more feasible.</p>
<p>We’ve established a base budget to achieve the necessary quality for this production. Unfortunately, after factoring in the supportive in-kind donations we’ve already had pledged from industry sponsors, we’re still faced with some hard costs we cannot avoid. But, with your help, they are not insurmountable. Any level of support is deeply appreciated and valuable to the making of this production.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>ABOUT THE PSA:</strong></p>
<p>In an issue that is so complex, we aim to cut to the heart of the matter and focus on the real victims of gun violence – kids. They are our future, and by ignoring this issue and threatening their safety, we endanger the well-being of our entire society.</p>
<p>In our PSA, we focus on a child’s discovery of a gun. How does that child come to understand what a gun is for; its purpose for destruction, and what we as a community think of bringing that into their lives? The PSA's purpose is not to take sides or give answers; but to stimulate an open discourse with the sincere hope of finding solutions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>HOW INDIEGOGO WORKS:</strong></p>
<p>By making a pledge, you bring us closer to attaining our goal. If we make the goal within the time limit set, we get the funding. If we don't make the goal in the time limit, we get charged a bigger fee to release the funds; which leaves us with even less money to make the PSA. If you join us in this cause, we will be one step closer to having our voices heard.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>THANK YOU</strong></p>
<p>If you like the idea of our PSA, we would be grateful for your support, and we'll make it count. If you can't pledge, please share the page with anyone you can. </p>
<p>Thank you for reading and I hope you will join the effort. </p></div>","WELCOME

<br/>In 2010, I started setting world records, and now have over 100 verified records, as well as being featured in the Guinness Book Of World Records: Gamer's Edition 2012 for ""The Most Prolific Dancing Game High Scorer.""  Over the last three years, I've also dedicated a lot of time volunteering for various charities, such as Child's Play, Able Gamers, The International Video Game Hall Of Fame and the American Cancer Society.  I try to combine gaming with charity work.</div>

Bit Evil S.A.- we grew up, just like all people do, we
got steady and respectable jobs at big firms and unexpectedly it
turned out that we didn't like our average 9 to 5 office jobs. But
lets skip the boring story of our everyday struggles in lives we
didn't want to lead and go straight to happy ending.</p>
<p>
 After a few talks we decided life is to short to spend
it being bored and unhappy. We got together and created Bit Evil S.A.
which is everything that we have dreamt of. Now we can put our
hearts, minds and efforts behind projects we believe in and are
passionate about. It’s our a “little bit evil” way to deliver
games, comics, clothing and a lot of cool stuff for everyone to
enjoy. We created a few games for Android, which you can check out on
<a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Bit+Evil+S.A.&amp;hl=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Google Play</a> right now! Whatever you do, whoever and wherever you are,
we want to bring joy and excitement to your life with our games.</p>
<p>
We are the new kid on the block of games industry, we
have heads full of ideas, but we lack funds. Sadly, in this world you
can't pay in huggs and rainbows, you need real money. And that is why
we are here, to share with you our passion project game <b>Space Pogo</b> and ask for your help to make it happen!</p>
<p>Our Team:</p>
<p></p>
<p>★ Andrzej – Commander in chief of Space Pogo world. Has the vision of
everything that Space Pogo can become.</p>
<p>
★ Anna – First mate keeping everyone and everything in cheeck with a
smile on her face. Definitely a Space Pogo believer.</p>
<p>
★ Piotr – First, Second &amp; Third Engineer of our Spaceship or as
some might simply call him Graphic designer extraordinaire.</p>

Long, long ago in a distant galaxy...sounds familiar? We

spaceship? Space Pogo is here to give you that chance! It doesn't

Pogo is great fun for everyone.</p>
<p>
So how does the story goes?</p>

unexpected threat appears out of nowhere. Hostile race of aliens is
gunning for your home planet. What do you do? What can you do? Well
it's Space Pogo time! You get a ship and go out there to fight the
enemy! Space is a frighteningly huge and dangerous place, but you're
not afraid are you? In the world of Space Pogo you are the only thing
that stands between total annihilation of  your planet and those
wicked aliens.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
<b>The rules of Space Pogo are quite simple!</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
	You have to be quick and precise to control your space
	ship and avoid the deadly asteroids coming at you!</p></li>
<li><p>Remember those ugly, mean aliens we talked about? You
	have to shoot em up before they'll shoot you up! Also don't let them
	get to close, or you' ll lose!</p></li>
<li>
<p>Earn your points! Unlock achievements and new weapons
	that will help you fight the good fight! There is no room for mercy
	for the enemy in Space Pogos world!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Remember if you play your cards right at Space Pogo, you
can Pogo yourself out of this space mess and end up on top!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
<b>How did Space Pogo came about?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
So what is Space Pogo all about? Do you remember those
old school shooter games? You know those of likes of Galaxian and
Space Invaders – they were pure joy and entertainment! We do
remember and love them. And idea for Space Pogo was born out of our
love for this type of games and nostalgia for the simple pleasure
playing them brought us.</p>
<p>As
everything we create Space Pogo was born and gained it first shape in
our idea incubator. The Ahoy<b><i> (<a href=""https://theahoy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Ahoy</a>)</i></b> our unique platform
for artists was the source of graphics for Space Pogo. </p>
<p>We are extremely grateful to Adrianna Glowacka who designed Space Pogo graphics for us. She is an amazing young polish concept artist and illustrator with specialization in character design. Adrianna prides herself in working mainly for games industries as this is where her true love lays. </p>
<p>Check out Adriannas work at</p>
<p><a href=""http://adriannaglowacka.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://adriannaglowacka.com/</a><br/></p>
<p>Music in our
game is the result of long search for simple yet unique sound. 
Gameplay and rules we used in Space Pogo are a compromise between
desire to create the most difficult game in the world and developing
the arcade game you can play with one hand.</p>
<p>
We created Space Pogo combining the simpicity of storys
from those oldschool games, graeat graphics, sound and our unique
ideas.</p>
<p>
We love Space Pogo and we want you to love it to! That
is why we want to make it better every day.</p>

Space Pogo you can choose one of two availbal space ships and start
your space quest. Travel through space moving right and left avoiding
asteroids and your enemies attacs. Shoot your enemies before they
shoot you! You'll be batteling four different alien creatures which
might be challenging in the begining, but don't get discouraged and
figt to save your planet! Shoot aliens, gain points and unlock

spirit of competition is important we want to introduce <b>daily
challenges</b> that

<p>We decided to
use crowdfunding as we are a small indie game developer and this was
only way we could obtain funds necessary for further development of
Space Pogo. We did everything we could with little money we had,
pouring our hearts, souls, time and efforts into Space Pogo.</p>
<p>After surfing
endless number of crowdfunding sites from all over the world we set
our hearts on Indiegogo as it seem to be the best fit for us. Great 
community of like minded people sharing passion and believe that
dreams do come true. We believe that Indiegogo community  will see
Space Pogos potential, fall in love with it and help us shape it into
the best version of itself it could possibly be.</p>
<p>We are here

</div></div>","Bit Evil S.A.- we grew up, just like all people do, we
got steady and respectable jobs at big firms and unexpectedly it
turned out that we didn't like our average 9 to 5 office jobs. But
lets skip the boring story of our everyday struggles in lives we
didn't want to lead and go straight to happy ending.

 After a few talks we decided life is to short to spend
it being bored and unhappy. We got together and created Bit Evil S.A.
which is everything that we have dreamt of. Now we can put our
hearts, minds and efforts behind projects we believe in and are
passionate about. It’s our a “little bit evil” way to deliver
games, comics, clothing and a lot of cool stuff for everyone to
enjoy. We created a few games for Android, which you can check out on
Google Play right now! Whatever you do, whoever and wherever you are,
we want to bring joy and excitement to your life with our games.

We are the new kid on the block of games industry, we
have heads full of ideas, but we lack funds. Sadly, in this world you
can't pay in huggs and rainbows, you need real money. And that is why
we are here, to share with you our passion project game Space Pogo and ask for your help to make it happen!
Our Team:

★ Andrzej – Commander in chief of Space Pogo world. Has the vision of
everything that Space Pogo can become.

★ Anna – First mate keeping everyone and everything in cheeck with a
smile on her face. Definitely a Space Pogo believer.

★ Piotr – First, Second & Third Engineer of our Spaceship or as
some might simply call him Graphic designer extraordinaire.
★ Katarzyna - Communications, Data Collection & Management Technician,  embarking on a first space adventure with the team of Space Pogo







Long, long ago in a distant galaxy...sounds familiar? We
know! Just see for yourself what it feels like!  It's a speace
shooter with unique graphics design. Are you ready for Space Pogo?

Have you ever wanted to become a captain of your own
spaceship? Space Pogo is here to give you that chance! It doesn't
matter if you're big or small, girl or a guy, young or old. Space
Pogo is great fun for everyone.

So how does the story goes?

Imagine you live your happy life in peace and one day an
unexpected threat appears out of nowhere. Hostile race of aliens is
gunning for your home planet. What do you do? What can you do? Well
it's Space Pogo time! You get a ship and go out there to fight the
enemy! Space is a frighteningly huge and dangerous place, but you're
not afraid are you? In the world of Space Pogo you are the only thing
that stands between total annihilation of  your planet and those
wicked aliens.


The rules of Space Pogo are quite simple!




	You have to be quick and precise to control your space
	ship and avoid the deadly asteroids coming at you!
Remember those ugly, mean aliens we talked about? You
	have to shoot em up before they'll shoot you up! Also don't let them
	get to close, or you' ll lose!

Earn your points! Unlock achievements and new weapons
	that will help you fight the good fight! There is no room for mercy
	for the enemy in Space Pogos world!





Remember if you play your cards right at Space Pogo, you
can Pogo yourself out of this space mess and end up on top!


How did Space Pogo came about?



So what is Space Pogo all about? Do you remember those
old school shooter games? You know those of likes of Galaxian and
Space Invaders – they were pure joy and entertainment! We do
remember and love them. And idea for Space Pogo was born out of our
love for this type of games and nostalgia for the simple pleasure
playing them brought us.
As
everything we create Space Pogo was born and gained it first shape in
our idea incubator. The Ahoy (The Ahoy) our unique platform
for artists was the source of graphics for Space Pogo. 
We are extremely grateful to Adrianna Glowacka who designed Space Pogo graphics for us. She is an amazing young polish concept artist and illustrator with specialization in character design. Adrianna prides herself in working mainly for games industries as this is where her true love lays. 
Check out Adriannas work at
http://adriannaglowacka.com/
Music in our
game is the result of long search for simple yet unique sound. 
Gameplay and rules we used in Space Pogo are a compromise between
desire to create the most difficult game in the world and developing
the arcade game you can play with one hand.

We created Space Pogo combining the simpicity of storys
from those oldschool games, graeat graphics, sound and our unique
ideas.

We love Space Pogo and we want you to love it to! That
is why we want to make it better every day.


Space Pogo for Android!

Space Pogo you can choose one of two availbal space ships and start
your space quest. Travel through space moving right and left avoiding
asteroids and your enemies attacs. Shoot your enemies before they
shoot you! You'll be batteling four different alien creatures which
might be challenging in the begining, but don't get discouraged and
figt to save your planet! Shoot aliens, gain points and unlock
achievements&guns. Gaining access to guns will make your fight so
much easier and more entertaining!

We
have big plans for Space Pogo, but remember it will only happen if
you guys believe in us and grace us with your support. We created
Space Pogo for Android, but we want as many pople as possible to
enjoy our game and with additional funding we are hoping to bring
Space Pogo to iOS and later also to other platforms.
For
now the story of Space Pogo is pretty straight forward – you choose
a spaceship and fight aliens to live another day.
We
want to make the game more enjoyable and diverse so we plan on
getting everything bigger&better. Creating new
levels, spaceships&enemies, guns&achievements,
more undiscovered corners of galaxy for you to explore! Every level

<h3>Story of E-Path, The game</h3>
<p>Half a year ago, we came up with an idea for a logic game. As a player you have to activate all the tiles of the floor. The challenge? There will be broken tiles and other obstacles - like teleports, fire and ice - that will make it harder to you. Also, you never have the chance to go back. “E-path” will make you think.</p>
<p>But this is just the beginning! After six months of hard work with no other resources than our best hopes, we have finally finished “e-path.” You can download it here:</p>
<p><a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=markit.game"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=markit.game</a></p>
<p>We want you all to play “e-path” for free, because we think that you all should have the chance to try it.</p>
<p>The aim of our company is to create a new set of challenging and entertaining games. Our first big try is “e-path” and we hope that as many people as possible will like it.</p>
<h3>The future of E-Path</h3>
<p>First of all, we invite everyone to play it and contribute giving us feedback. After that, we would love to improve it, adding a new version with Online Challenges (where you will be able to send the maps to your friends), Cooperative Online Mode, “e-path” available for other platforms and so on.</p>
<p>We do believe in this game. We wanted to play this kind of game while we where waiting for the bus and we have programmed it. We wanted challenges for our minds and also an enthralling game. Would you like to be part of our project?</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What is the help for &amp; What you will get</h3>
<p>In order to complete all next stages of the development of the game, we need our own servers and more fellow programmers that would want to help us in this adventure.</p>
<p>All the money will be invested in the servers for the game and the development team in order to add the following features:</p>
<div class=""im"">
<ul>
<li>Sharing the maps you generate with other friends.</li>
<li>Compare your scores with other people all around the world.</li>
<li>Create your own maps, not only done randomly, but by choosing each tile type and position.</li>
<li>Create new kinds of tiles, to make it even more interesting.</li>
<li>Have an Ad-free version.</li>
<li>Create tournaments, as if it is the new kind of ""chess"" sport.</li>
<li>Direct online playing in cooperative mode.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>If more income than expected is achieved, also an iOS, Windows Phone 8, and browser version will be developed.</p>
<p>If the goal is not reached, the features will also be planned, but not all of them will be available or released (due to server costs / people work).</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The world of smartphones and tablets has already arived. A good maze game, with online features should be created. Social networks + thinking games is the best for everyone.</p>
<p>Help us to create the most challenging and interesting maze game ever seen. We believe in e-path, and also hope you do as well.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p><span>Although the money is useful for upgrading the game, a social game like this one won’t get far if you do not share it with your friends. Help us giving feedback, ideas and sharing it with your friends and family. Lets change the world!</span></p>

All the money will be invested in the servers for the game and the development team in order to add the following features:


Sharing the maps you generate with other friends.
Compare your scores with other people all around the world.
Create your own maps, not only done randomly, but by choosing each tile type and position.
Create new kinds of tiles, to make it even more interesting.
Have an Ad-free version.
Create tournaments, as if it is the new kind of ""chess"" sport.
Direct online playing in cooperative mode.


If more income than expected is achieved, also an iOS, Windows Phone 8, and browser version will be developed.
If the goal is not reached, the features will also be planned, but not all of them will be available or released (due to server costs / people work).


The Impact
The world of smartphones and tablets has already arived. A good maze game, with online features should be created. Social networks + thinking games is the best for everyone.
Help us to create the most challenging and interesting maze game ever seen. We believe in e-path, and also hope you do as well.


Other Ways You Can Help
Although the money is useful for upgrading the game, a social game like this one won’t get far if you do not share it with your friends. Help us giving feedback, ideas and sharing it with your friends and family. Lets change the world!",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

Though we both followed our home team (who dey!), we didn’t know a tight end from an end run.</p><p>That was until we were introduced to fantasy football.</p><p>As life-long fans of role-playing games, it took only a few weeks of fantasy football for the similarities between the two to become obvious. You assemble a team of different classes, carefully manage who’s in your party, and then get into random encounters where the outcome of the battle is all about stats vs stats. Interest became obsession within weeks. We found ourselves tuning in to games just to watch a kicker on a team we never even cared about before.</p><p>We were hooked.</p><p>And as we discussed our new appreciation for football – both real and fantasy – we both realized how much fun it would it be if fantasy football could be expanded into something more interactive and off the wall. Something that felt a bit more like a game, and a bit less like dueling box scores. A game where your stats could grow over time, based on your personal choices and customization preferences, to make your team even more your own.</p><p>And thus, Dragons &amp; Gridirons was born.

This geeky fever dream is only possible through your kindness and generosity!</p><h2>Risks and challenges</h2><p>The key challenge will be the web development work of implementing the unique features of Dragons and Gridirons in a web application. We’ve contracted with a development team that’s highly specialized and experienced in fantasy sports, and we’ve already completed the site designs. Based on their proven track record in this area, we’re very confident that they can get the job done.</p><p>Cost overruns are a natural concern when it comes to web development. We will do whatever it takes to complete this project once it is funded, even if our expenses turn out to be greater than anticipated. We take our commitment to our backers extremely seriously.</p><p>We’ve made it a point to set this process in motion well in advance of the 2018 season, and so we don’t anticipate our timeline to be a risk. Our developers have provided an estimate of 19 weeks to complete the rest of the development. That gives us a projected completion date around the end of this year’s football season, with 5-6 months to do additional testing and preparation.</p><p>Finally, game balance will be important to making DnG as entertaining as it can be. We’ll be using archival fantasy data to look at the average impact of each card, to refine what week they unlock, how many magic points they use up, and whether they have a cooldown cost. Of course, every week is different, so there will never be a no-brainer “best” set of cards to use. And that’s part of the fun! Some cards will turn out to be a better value than others. Figuring out which will be a part of gaining an edge over the rest of your league…</p><h2>FAQ</h2><p><i>So is this some kind of video game?</i></p><p>Dragons &amp; Gridirons is a web application (software you access through a web site) for hosting fantasy football leagues. It's not a game that you download, just a web site that you go to where you can play in one of our unique fantasy football leagues.</p><p><i>How do I get spell cards?</i></p><p>Teams begin the season with the same set of basic spell cards. You get 3 new spell cards each week. You simply choose which 3 you want to add to your deck from the spell card library. There is no real-life money involved in this process - selecting these new spell cards is a normal game mechanic.</p><p><i>How much do spell cards cost?</i></p><p>They're FREE. There are no micro-transactions in Dragons &amp; Gridirons. You get to choose 3 new spell cards each week (through week 10) as a game mechanic.</p><p><i>Ah, so I buy ""gold pieces"" with real world money, and use those to trade in f-</i></p><p>NO</p><p><i>Why even have 100+ spell cards when I'll just pick the most powerful ones and spam them week after week to destroy my friends? FOOLS!</i></p><p>Not so fast. There are two rules guiding your choice of spell cards:</p><p>1) Each spell card fits within a tier of similarly powerful spells, and higher up tiers remain locked (unavailable for anyone to select) until later weeks in the fantasy season. A new tier of spell cards unlocks each week up until week 10, at which point all spell cards are unlocked.</p><p>2) Each spell card also fits within a certain skill tree. In order to add a spell card to your deck with one of your 3 selections for the week, you must have all the previous cards within that same skill tree. For example, if you want the spell card that gives a target player triple TD points, you need to have chosen the double TD spell card already.</p><p><i>How many spells can I cast each week?</i></p><p>There's no limit on the number of spells per se. Activating a spell card before/during your matchup uses up a certain amount of magic points (MP), which varies from spell to spell. Teams all receive the same weekly MP allowance. The MP allowance increases from weeks 1 through 10, allowing you to activate increasingly powerful spells, or apply numerous basic spells.</p><p><i>How many times can spell cards be used?</i></p><p>Each spell card can be used a maximum of once per week. They are not consumed upon use - they remain in your deck for next week. Some of the most powerful cards, however, do have a cooldown period - a waiting period before you can use them again. Cooldown periods are typically 1-2 weeks.</p><p><i>Hm, so I guess I'll save all my best spells for the championship, right?</i></p><p>Not necessary. All spell cards in a cooldown state are refreshed at the start of the playoffs, and again at each week of the playoffs. So there's no need to horde your best spells for your championship - every playoff game will let you pit your best against your opponent's best.</p><p><i>How are the effects of spell cards scored?</i></p><p>The scoring of each spell effect is a direct function of the base score it's being applied to, and each spell effect is handled separately (i.e., additively). So if you use both a Double TD spell and a Triple TD spell on the same player, each 6-point TD he scores will get you an extra 18 points, not 54. Because that'd just be ridiculous.</p><p><i>How do boosts and nerfs interact when applied to the same player?</i></p><p>As with boosts, nerf cards typically don't impact how many bonus points you get from boosting the same base score. A doubled TD gives you +6 bonus points, even if a separate card is cutting the TD value in half (that would count separately as -3 bonus points). The only exception comes up with cards that ""eliminate points"" - those actual change the base score to 0. Otherwise, the base score stays the same and the effect of each spell just creates bonus points.</p><p>tl,dr: Just think of a boosts and nerfs as adding completely new values rather than modifying the base score, unless the base score is ""eliminated"" first.</p><p><i>But the season is already underway!</i></p><p>We're launching in 2018. Plenty of time before then, right?</p><p><i>You're a shrink and a gun maker? How can I trust you to code a web application?</i></p><p>You can't. Fortunately, we're working with developers who specialize in fantasy sports applications, and they're doing the coding. We're handling all the other other stuff, like coming up with fun spell ideas and game rules, based on our 50+ years of combined experience playing RPG's and collectible card games. Marketing involves a lot of psychology and writing, so Edward's got that down. Creating an application this extensive involves a lot of project management, so Jay's got that down. And we're fortunate to have some friends to help when they can put their skills to use.</p><p><i>This sounds awesome, I want to help! What can I do?</i></p><p>The number one way people can help is just by spreading the word, or even enlisting other friends to spread the word. Tell your leaguemates, use the share buttons above to post on social media, write a blog post, start a thread on your favorite message board.</p><p>If you're serious about wanting to do more, email dragon@dragonsandgridirons.com and let us know what sort of time and skills you want to put to use.

You’re up by a point, but you don’t have any active players left. Your opponent still has their RB1 left to play.You’re pretty well screwed.So what do you do?Well, up until now, you couldn’t actually do anything. Fantasy football means drafting, scouring the waiver wire, picking a lineup…then waiting and watching – powerless.That ends right here.Dragons & Gridirons is a new, interactive version of fantasy football, where you get the power to impact the outcome as your matchup unfolds. You'll customize your team with over 100 spell cards that do everything from boost your players’ yardage to banish opponent players to the X-Zone.Dragons & Gridirons is based on traditional, season-long fantasy football. You form a league of 11 or so friends, draft your teams from the current pool of NFL players, and then face off in head-to-head battles  (""matchups"" in FF speak) each week of the real world football season.The outcome of each battle is the result of both traditional fantasy scoring (i.e., you earn fantasy points when players on your team earn stats in their real life NFL games), and the impact of your/your opponent’s use of spell cards.Let's say you have a running back who got you 10 fantasy points one week, from 40 rushing yards (4 points) plus a touchdown (6 points).If you had the foresight to play your the Double TD Points spell card on him before he found the end zone, you'd end up with 16 points from that player. (4 + 6x2).Some spells, like Snow Day, will impact your entire league! Even the more basic cards can be directly applied to any valid player in your league*. Feel like meddling in a battle that you're not  a part of, to try to tilt the standings in your favor? You can do that! Just don't blame us if your league gangs up on you next week..(*This ability can be toggled on/off when setting up your league, so if this is too cutthroat for your group, just turn it off before drafting.)It’s up to you to decide whether you use multiple small spell effects or go for broke with one powerful spell that could turn the tide of the game.Spell cards go into effect in real time. Do you play your hand early to capture the full benefit? Or do you wait and see how things are playing out, at the risk of failing to get a boost on some big plays?Each team begins the season with the same set of basic spell cards, and then you get to choose three new spell cards to add to your deck each week that advance you up various skill trees. This occurs as a basic and automatic game mechanic - there are no micro-transactions in Dragons & Gridirons. Each team will have the exact same access to spell cards as any other team - no money or ""currency"" required.We've included more details in our FAQ (at the very bottom) for any rule lawyers out there. Start plotting your loopholes to exploit now!For those unfamiliar with Indiegogo: funding can work on a flexible basis, or an all-or-nothing basis. To underscore our ironclad commitment to seeing Dragons & Gridirons all the way through, we've chosen flexible funding.  That means we'll receive whatever funds are pledged, regardless of whether our goal is met, and we're going to move forward with the project, even if the funding falls shorts.If you think our goal seems like less than what's needed for a project of this scale, you'd be right. Our goal amount reflects only what's left after our considerable investment (both years and money) into the project. Our inner circle also came up big in our previous crowdfunding effort.We have some great Perks in store for those who back our project! Tiers ranges from $3 to $5000, so hopefully everyone can find a level that works for them and delivers them something valuable in return for their generous support of Dragons & Gridirons.If you're not in a position to pledge a financial contribution, we would also be very, very grateful for your support in spreading the word to friends! Use the buttons below to automatically share a link to our campaign. You never know who else might want to contribute.Up until just a few years ago, neither one of use was what you would call a die-hard football fan. Though we both followed our home team (who dey!), we didn’t know a tight end from an end run.That was until we were introduced to fantasy football.As life-long fans of role-playing games, it took only a few weeks of fantasy football for the similarities between the two to become obvious. You assemble a team of different classes, carefully manage who’s in your party, and then get into random encounters where the outcome of the battle is all about stats vs stats. Interest became obsession within weeks. We found ourselves tuning in to games just to watch a kicker on a team we never even cared about before.We were hooked.And as we discussed our new appreciation for football – both real and fantasy – we both realized how much fun it would it be if fantasy football could be expanded into something more interactive and off the wall. Something that felt a bit more like a game, and a bit less like dueling box scores. A game where your stats could grow over time, based on your personal choices and customization preferences, to make your team even more your own.And thus, Dragons & Gridirons was born. Two years later, we’re ready to unleash our creation on the world. But we need your help to get this thing going!The core of the D&G team is Fantasy Realm Sports, LLC; Co-Founders: Edward and Jay. Recognizing the scope of the project and our own skills and not-skills, we've tapped friends and professionals alike to help with the project. Development is being handled by a highly skilled studio that specializes in fantasy sports applications.Edward C. Wright, Ph.D., is a writer, entrepreneur, and board certified clinical psychologist. He grew up in Cincinnati and went to Miami University before receiving his M.A. and Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from George Mason University. He now lives in Boston with his girlfriend and two cats. He finds inspiration in video games, anime, graphic novels, sci-fi movies, and Armin van Buurin’s A State of Trance radio show.  He is the author of upcoming post-apocalyptic martial arts novel, The Teleknight, and a bunch of psychology stuff that you've never heard of.Jay Wilson is a designer, developer, and production facilitator of advanced weapons and accessories. A Cincinnati native, Jay has a bachelors degree from The College of Design, Architecture, Art, and Planning at the University of Cincinnati, and has worked with specifiers, suppliers, and OEM sellers of both private and government ordnance systems. Jay is an enthusiastic eater and chef, an avid hiker and cyclist, and a lover of adventure and hijinks. He resides in a cyberpunk dystopian urban core with his wife and a miniature black panther that is most assuredly not a common house cat.As you can plainly see from the football below, we've been making steady progress, and things have really taken off since establishing our development team. We've left ourselves plenty of time to deliver an amazing experience with the 2018 season.Thank you for your support of Dragons & Gridirons! This geeky fever dream is only possible through your kindness and generosity!Risks and challengesThe key challenge will be the web development work of implementing the unique features of Dragons and Gridirons in a web application. We’ve contracted with a development team that’s highly specialized and experienced in fantasy sports, and we’ve already completed the site designs. Based on their proven track record in this area, we’re very confident that they can get the job done.Cost overruns are a natural concern when it comes to web development. We will do whatever it takes to complete this project once it is funded, even if our expenses turn out to be greater than anticipated. We take our commitment to our backers extremely seriously.We’ve made it a point to set this process in motion well in advance of the 2018 season, and so we don’t anticipate our timeline to be a risk. Our developers have provided an estimate of 19 weeks to complete the rest of the development. That gives us a projected completion date around the end of this year’s football season, with 5-6 months to do additional testing and preparation.Finally, game balance will be important to making DnG as entertaining as it can be. We’ll be using archival fantasy data to look at the average impact of each card, to refine what week they unlock, how many magic points they use up, and whether they have a cooldown cost. Of course, every week is different, so there will never be a no-brainer “best” set of cards to use. And that’s part of the fun! Some cards will turn out to be a better value than others.

We have already built, tested, and developed the fundamental back-end of MAGE that allows the platform to add in features such as dynamic content, analytics, and push notifications. However, the front-end and synchronized building on multiple platforms still needs to be developed. This could prove to be more challenging and time-consuming than originally anticipated. Our team is experienced with encountering and defeating obstacles and we take each challenge on with vigor.Fulfillment: As each platform capability is completed and added to MAGE we will send out notifications to each backer so that they can logon and start building their application.Thank you again, to our wonderful Indiegogo supporters!",13.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Please check our commented gameplay video of the original J.U.L.I.A. in the gallery section.</p>
<h3><img alt=""Introduction"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.cbe-software.com/IndieGoGo/Introduction.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Introduction""/></h3>
<p>Dear backers,</p>
<p>My name is Jan Kavan and I am musician, writer and game developer. With my small independent studio we've already created 4 video games - Ghost in the Sheet, J.U.L.I.A., J.U.L.I.A. Untold and Vampires! Personally I did contribute to many other games including Tale of a Hero (Peregrius / Future Games), Carol Reed series (MDNA games), Dark Fall 2 or Barrow Hill.</p>
<p>I strongly believe in innovation and for that reason we always try to bring fresh air into our games. This comes for a price though - not always we get everything right the first time around.</p>
<h3><img alt=""About"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.cbe-software.com/IndieGoGo/WhatIs.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""About""/></h3>
<p><span>J.U.L.I.A. is an innovative, narrative driven PC game. The story centers on Rachel Manners, a 35 year old astrobiologist. She is a member of an elite group of scientists, chosen to embark on one of the most critical missions ever conceived on Earth. Now Rachel is alone, orbiting an unknown planet. Her only companions are J.U.L.I.A., the space probe’s artificial intelligence and Mobot, a huge reconnaissance robot. Together, this unlikely trio will explore the mysteries of the solar system of Salia. But are they prepared for what </span>they will find?</p>
<p>Find out more about the story at our official page:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.juliathegame.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img alt=""Homepage"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.cbe-software.com/IndieGoGo/homepageBanner.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Homepage""/></a></p>
<h3><img alt=""Why enhanced"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.cbe-software.com/IndieGoGo/WhyEnhanced.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Why enhanced""/></h3>
<p>When we've released J.U.L.I.A. back in 2012, the response especially from the adventure gaming community was amazing. While we've approached our players with a certain degree of concern, knowing that this is a new video game format, we've been well accepted and especially the story, music and game flow was generally praised.</p>
<p>Also the game was just recently nominated for the best gameplay and the best character (Mobot) by adventure gamers - the largest international website specialized on adventure games!</p>
<p>This came to us as a big surprise because we've been working on the game for more than 3 years in only two persons. The fact that we've invested only our time and my personal budget however negatively influenced some of the game aspects.</p>
<p>The ultimate problem appeared when the only income we've been able to get from our three years of hard work covered merely the legal expenses to reclaim back J.U.L.I.A. rights.</p>
<p>So now we stand here, asking you to help us iron the edges. We ask only for a bare minimum to help us survive and polish the generally disliked stuff.</p>
<h3><img alt=""What is going on"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.cbe-software.com/IndieGoGo/WhaIsGoing.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""What is going on""/></h3>
<p>The basic goal consisted of the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create backers' only event of recreating Rachel Manners from scratch, making the used model much more human.</li>
<li>Redesigning some of the game interface and getting backers' feedback for the new looks.</li>
<li>Making certain parts of the game optional (like harvesting minigame for example).</li>
<li>Introducing easy mode for problematic puzzles.</li>
<li>Rewriting some of the puzzles which helps better reflecting on what to do.</li>
<li>Extending some of the music tracks which repeat too much.</li>
<li>Polishing some of the puzzles to be more reactive to players.</li>
<li>Refine a few parts of the script when it gets ridiculous / over the top. One needs a bit of a distance to do that and I am fairly positive that I can do this now. </li>
</ul><p>However! Thanks to your amazing support we're able to introduce you with the stretch goals for enhancing J.U.L.I.A. even more.</p>
<p><img alt=""Stretch Goals"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.cbe-software.com/IndieGoGo/goals/StretchGoals02Short.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Stretch Goals""/></p>
<h3><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> </span></strong></h3>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline; font-size: 1.17em;"">$7</span></strong><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline; font-size: 1.17em;"">.500 - Story Expansion</span></strong></p>
<p>- We will seriously enhance the exploration part of the story. The exploration areas will become larger with more choices and we will also introduce some of the crew members who were left out from the original game.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline; font-size: 1.17em;""><strong><span>$12.500 - Fullscreen Exploration</span></strong></span></strong></p>
<p>- We will change the exploration to a hybrid between J.U.L.I.A. exploration mode and fullscreen point’n’click adventure game. We will create fullscreen visuals for each of the exploration views and the actions will be issued through contextual menu interface. This way the spirit of J.U.L.I.A will remain but both visually and gameplay-wise the enhanced edition is going to become more engaging. </p>
<p>This will require us to create a brand new visuals for many new scenes. Our next update will show you a comparison how this expansion would look like.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline; font-size: 1.17em;"">$25.000 - PC, MAC and LINUX Unity 3D port</span></strong></p>
<p>- Many people asked us to do Mac or Linux port or to allow for resolutions larger than 1024x768. If we port the whole game to Unity 3D, it will open a whole incredible window of possibilities and then we can promise native Mac and Linux build as well. While this means basically recreating the game assets and code from scratch, it’s still easier than doing another game. </p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><img alt=""How much"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.cbe-software.com/IndieGoGo/HowMuch.jpg"" src="""" style=""font-size: 1.17em;"" title=""How much""/></p>
<p>For this all to work we need at least $5000. There are many other things we could do with J.U.L.I.A., but we're being modest with our goal and if you decide to trust us and help us fund the project beyond the original target, we have many ways how to appreciate it starting from multiple localizations, including J.U.L.I.A. Untold (prequel to J.U.L.I.A.) as a part of the game, creating a basic lipsync, extending the gameplay etc. We're not there yet and for that reason we'll leave this for an eventual update.</p>
<p>Why do we need $5000?</p>
<p>In case we will get exactly $5000:</p>
<ul>
<li>$350 will be given to IndieGoGo team</li>
<li>Roughly $1000 is estimated to fulfill our promised physical perks and shipments</li>
<li>We will of course have to pay taxes from the income and it also seems that we will have to pay taxes from shipping out the physical rewards thanks to a tax gray zone.</li>
<li>With this basic funding we will need 3 months of two people to deliver the Enhanced Edition</li>
</ul><p>When we sum this up, it leaves us with just enough money to create the promised enhanced edition of J.U.L.I.A. </p>

<p><strong>Adventure Gamers 4/5 stars (Katie Hazen)</strong></p>
<p><em>“Plenty of varied puzzles will appeal to players looking for a challenge, and the story of humanity’s dealings with others and itself will draw you into its sci-fi mystery, while the decisions you’re forced to make will resonate long after you’ve left the game behind. There are really no games out there quite like J.U.L.I.A., and anyone interested in something a little different will be rewarded with a fun experience that’s well worth the time and effort.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Just Adventure B (Ray Ivey)</strong></p>
<p><em>“You can feel the love the designers of this game have for the adventure genre. It oozes out of every pore of the game. It makes you want to call them up and sit around and have a conversation about everyone’s favorite old adventure games.”</em></p>
<p><strong>GameBoomers B++ (Flotsam)</strong></p>
<p><em>“…J.U.L.I.A. provides eight or so hours of thoughtful, enjoyable, story driven science fiction, a good number of well crafted and varied puzzles, and some excellent looking cutscenes. J.U.L.I.A. is a game I would happily recommend as being well worth the price of admission.”</em></p>
<p><strong>Gamercast.net 4/5 (Charlotte Woolley)</strong></p>
<p><em>“…J.U.L.I.A is an all-round fantastic adventure game, with an intriguing story and a very satisfying ending. It supplies fresh and challenging puzzles and includes one of the most endearing robots since Dog. If you are looking for an engaging and enjoyable adventure game and don’t judge a book by its cover, look no further than J.U.L.I.A”</em></p>
<p><strong>Adrenaline Vault 4/5 (Michael Smith)</strong></p>
<p><em>“J.U.L.I.A. is obviously a labor of love, and it’s hard to be critical of a labor of love. But a few more hands on deck would’ve helped turn a good-looking, sometimes frustrating puzzle fest into an outstanding adventure game. The future appears bright for CBE; I look forward to their next project.”</em></p>

<p><img alt=""Frequently asked questions"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.cbe-software.com/IndieGoGo/FAQ.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Frequently asked questions""/></p>
<p><strong>Q: When will be the advanced edition ready?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Basic idea is to finish in 3 months from being succesfuly funded. However if our gently backers allow us to do more with the Enhanced Edition, we'll make sure to be very transparent with longer development cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How will I vote for Rachel / Interface looks?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We will set up a private backers forum. Here all polls and discussions will take place. We will inform you continuously about our ongoing progress and share some imagery, concepts etc. as well.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why IndieGoGo?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>We are Czech-based company and Kickstarter is not available for us. While KS is perceived to be more influential for video games, we still strongly hope that we can achieve our modest goal through IndieGoGo as well.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Should I include shipping and handling for physical shipments?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Not at all. We've calculated those in the pledge level. I believe it's better this way. Since we're Czech based, I bet that 99% of all the shipments will go abroad anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I want to upgrade my pledge. How should I do it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: </strong>Simply add another pledge to the level you want to reach and the only rule is to use the same email address which you’ve used for your original pledge. When we end this campaign, I will sum pledges by email and run this result through you so you can check that we got your pledges right.</p>

 - 19th of March 2013 - We would like to show you a visual difference between story expansion stretch goal and full screen planetary exploration. Your support will decide! Thank you!

- 8th of March 2013 - We did it! We've got funded thanks to your awesome support. We've added stretch goals with an explanatory video as an update no. 6. For visual and textual description please scroll down below.
Important information
If you want to upgrade your pledge, see FAQ at the very bottom of this campaign. Unlike with KickStarter, your pledges here are summed. So if you want to upgrade $7 to $25, your second pledge should be only $18. I hope this clears up all the confusion with a different pledging system.
Help us create an enhanced version of our point'n'click science fiction PC game J.U.L.I.A.
Please check our commented gameplay video of the original J.U.L.I.A. in the gallery section.

Dear backers,
My name is Jan Kavan and I am musician, writer and game developer. With my small independent studio we've already created 4 video games - Ghost in the Sheet, J.U.L.I.A., J.U.L.I.A. Untold and Vampires! Personally I did contribute to many other games including Tale of a Hero (Peregrius / Future Games), Carol Reed series (MDNA games), Dark Fall 2 or Barrow Hill.
I strongly believe in innovation and for that reason we always try to bring fresh air into our games. This comes for a price though - not always we get everything right the first time around.

J.U.L.I.A. is an innovative, narrative driven PC game. The story centers on Rachel Manners, a 35 year old astrobiologist. She is a member of an elite group of scientists, chosen to embark on one of the most critical missions ever conceived on Earth. Now Rachel is alone, orbiting an unknown planet. Her only companions are J.U.L.I.A., the space probe’s artificial intelligence and Mobot, a huge reconnaissance robot. Together, this unlikely trio will explore the mysteries of the solar system of Salia. But are they prepared for what they will find?
Find out more about the story at our official page:


When we've released J.U.L.I.A. back in 2012, the response especially from the adventure gaming community was amazing. While we've approached our players with a certain degree of concern, knowing that this is a new video game format, we've been well accepted and especially the story, music and game flow was generally praised.
Also the game was just recently nominated for the best gameplay and the best character (Mobot) by adventure gamers - the largest international website specialized on adventure games!
This came to us as a big surprise because we've been working on the game for more than 3 years in only two persons. The fact that we've invested only our time and my personal budget however negatively influenced some of the game aspects.
The ultimate problem appeared when the only income we've been able to get from our three years of hard work covered merely the legal expenses to reclaim back J.U.L.I.A. rights.
So now we stand here, asking you to help us iron the edges. We ask only for a bare minimum to help us survive and polish the generally disliked stuff.

The basic goal consisted of the following items:

Create backers' only event of recreating Rachel Manners from scratch, making the used model much more human.
Redesigning some of the game interface and getting backers' feedback for the new looks.
Making certain parts of the game optional (like harvesting minigame for example).
Introducing easy mode for problematic puzzles.
Rewriting some of the puzzles which helps better reflecting on what to do.
Extending some of the music tracks which repeat too much.
Polishing some of the puzzles to be more reactive to players.
Refine a few parts of the script when it gets ridiculous / over the top. One needs a bit of a distance to do that and I am fairly positive that I can do this now. 
However! Thanks to your amazing support we're able to introduce you with the stretch goals for enhancing J.U.L.I.A. even more.

 
$7.500 - Story Expansion
- We will seriously enhance the exploration part of the story. The exploration areas will become larger with more choices and we will also introduce some of the crew members who were left out from the original game.
$12.500 - Fullscreen Exploration
- We will change the exploration to a hybrid between J.U.L.I.A. exploration mode and fullscreen point’n’click adventure game. We will create fullscreen visuals for each of the exploration views and the actions will be issued through contextual menu interface. This way the spirit of J.U.L.I.A will remain but both visually and gameplay-wise the enhanced edition is going to become more engaging. 
This will require us to create a brand new visuals for many new scenes. Our next update will show you a comparison how this expansion would look like.
$25.000 - PC, MAC and LINUX Unity 3D port
- Many people asked us to do Mac or Linux port or to allow for resolutions larger than 1024x768. If we port the whole game to Unity 3D, it will open a whole incredible window of possibilities and then we can promise native Mac and Linux build as well. While this means basically recreating the game assets and code from scratch, it’s still easier than doing another game. 
 

For this all to work we need at least $5000. There are many other things we could do with J.U.L.I.A., but we're being modest with our goal and if you decide to trust us and help us fund the project beyond the original target, we have many ways how to appreciate it starting from multiple localizations, including J.U.L.I.A. Untold (prequel to J.U.L.I.A.) as a part of the game, creating a basic lipsync, extending the gameplay etc. We're not there yet and for that reason we'll leave this for an eventual update.
Why do we need $5000?
In case we will get exactly $5000:

$350 will be given to IndieGoGo team
Roughly $1000 is estimated to fulfill our promised physical perks and shipments
We will of course have to pay taxes from the income and it also seems that we will have to pay taxes from shipping out the physical rewards thanks to a tax gray zone.
With this basic funding we will need 3 months of two people to deliver the Enhanced Edition
When we sum this up, it leaves us with just enough money to create the promised enhanced edition of J.U.L.I.A. 

Adventure Gamers 4/5 stars (Katie Hazen)
“Plenty of varied puzzles will appeal to players looking for a challenge, and the story of humanity’s dealings with others and itself will draw you into its sci-fi mystery, while the decisions you’re forced to make will resonate long after you’ve left the game behind. There are really no games out there quite like J.U.L.I.A., and anyone interested in something a little different will be rewarded with a fun experience that’s well worth the time and effort.”
Just Adventure B (Ray Ivey)
“You can feel the love the designers of this game have for the adventure genre. It oozes out of every pore of the game. It makes you want to call them up and sit around and have a conversation about everyone’s favorite old adventure games.”
GameBoomers B++ (Flotsam)
“…J.U.L.I.A. provides eight or so hours of thoughtful, enjoyable, story driven science fiction, a good number of well crafted and varied puzzles, and some excellent looking cutscenes. J.U.L.I.A. is a game I would happily recommend as being well worth the price of admission.”
Gamercast.net 4/5 (Charlotte Woolley)
“…J.U.L.I.A is an all-round fantastic adventure game, with an intriguing story and a very satisfying ending. It supplies fresh and challenging puzzles and includes one of the most endearing robots since Dog. If you are looking for an engaging and enjoyable adventure game and don’t judge a book by its cover, look no further than J.U.L.I.A”
Adrenaline Vault 4/5 (Michael Smith)
“J.U.L.I.A. is obviously a labor of love, and it’s hard to be critical of a labor of love. But a few more hands on deck would’ve helped turn a good-looking, sometimes frustrating puzzle fest into an outstanding adventure game. The future appears bright for CBE; I look forward to their next project.”

No problem! We have a playable demo readily available so you can see if this game would be your cup of tea.
 

If you look to the right side of this campaign, you can see a description of all the beautiful rewards we offer for your generous help. However to get a visual idea what are you going to get for your kind contribution, we've created a visual overview for each individual pledge. Please refer to the pledge level description for details. Also, please note, that shipping is a part of the pledge. No need to add any extra money on top.

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 

 
 
 
 
 

First of all, please do support us at Steam Greenlight by tossing a free upvote. Not only it will help us, but also it allows us to give you a Steam game key. 

 
There are other ways how to help us. Please spread the word among your friends, classmates, families etc. 
Below this campaign you can quickly approach our Facebook and Twitter pages, so please do like us there and feel free to follow us. We're not paranoid... yet.

Q: When will be the advanced edition ready?
A: Basic idea is to finish in 3 months from being succesfuly funded. However if our gently backers allow us to do more with the Enhanced Edition, we'll make sure to be very transparent with longer development cycle.
Q: How will I vote for Rachel / Interface looks?
A: We will set up a private backers forum. Here all polls and discussions will take place. We will inform you continuously about our ongoing progress and share some imagery, concepts etc. as well.
Q: Why IndieGoGo?
A: We are Czech-based company and Kickstarter is not available for us. While KS is perceived to be more influential for video games, we still strongly hope that we can achieve our modest goal through IndieGoGo as well.
Q: Should I include shipping and handling for physical shipments?
A: Not at all. We've calculated those in the pledge level. I believe it's better this way. Since we're Czech based, I bet that 99% of all the shipments will go abroad anyway.
Q: I want to upgrade my pledge. How should I do it?
A: Simply add another pledge to the level you want to reach and the only rule is to use the same email address which you’ve used for your original pledge. When we end this campaign, I will sum pledges by email and run this result through you so you can check that we got your pledges right.",31.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What is CodeLump?</h3>
<p>Lumps of code are scattered around the internet! The web is not as it appears: it is an ever-expanding battlefield full of mines and resource crates. Posts guide the way to safe ground, but may also lead to traps, so beware! CodeLump is the invisible layer of the web, the layer that contains this world of chaos. Among the chaos are players like you and me. Players explore the web using Google's Chrome browser and the CodeLump extension, which allows them to interact with the CodeLump universe. CodeLump consists of three basic entities: mines, crates, and posts. The concept is simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mines take away points</li>
<li>Crates give points</li>
<li>Posts suggest places to go on the internet</li>
</ul>
<p>These entities are placed automatically by AIs that underly the CodeLump universe, as well as by players. Players can purchase crates if they're feeling generous, and stash them around the internet for other players to find, or mines if they want to wreak a little havok. A player may lead others to treasures or a trap using a post. This game is revolutionary, spanning the entire web! All of this is accessed via a simple Chrome extension. The user installs our extension, and automatically gets a toolbar added to the top of every page allowing them to view their inventory; place mines, crates, or posts; and more!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<p>Here's the basic break down:</p>
<p>We need a couple thousand dollars to ensure that server costs are covered, the downfall of our predecessor, The Nethernet. The money will also be put into finding and hiring great artists to make the game look just as fun as it feels to play. Finally, the money will be put into miscellaneous tasks such as hiring an attorney to review our terms of service, etc, and other tasks required to launch a good product.</p>
<p>Of course, if I were in your shoes I'd be wondering why I'd throw my hard earned money into such an ambitious project. This is why we're offering incentives for different levels of contribution. Almost everyone who donates (all donations greater than or equal to $5) will get access to our closed beta, and have the privillege of playing the game before it's released to the general public. For higher-level contributions, we might even give you some impact in the development of CodeLump!  If we can make it happen, it's as good as done! If you want to have your contribution guaranteed to be acknowledged, we need at least $75. Then, if we like your idea and think it will work, we'll add it in the game. If we don't add it, you'll still get a super awesome CodeLump t-shirt! If you go super crazy supportive of this project and donate over $200, we'll send you two shirts: one for you and one for a friend, in addition to listening to your game contribution idea and kissing up to you as long as our game exists. You'll be granted a large sum of premium credits when and if the premium system is released, and you'll be entered on a wall of fame on our website (if you wish).</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Join the revolution</h3>
<p>We want to make this game the next big thing, so, when you recieve beta access, you're allowed to distribute the extension to as many people as you want! The way the game is designed, there is a direct correlation between the number of players and the awesomeness of the game.</p>
<p>If you can't contribute money, per se, don't be deterred! Try to tell as many people about us as you can! </p>

<h3>Jake's Field Vision</h3>
<p>Jake is passionate about football.  He plays it in the pool, on the trampoline, on the grass, on the wii and even in real pads on his Pop Warner team - go Falcons!  On an especially long trip at the age of 7, he and I decided to come up with a simple game to play with a regular deck of playing cards.  I gave him the general concepts of how to make it fun and realistic and he ran with it.  We have refined it a few times over the last year, but it turned out amazing. He and I can literally play it for hours together or alone.</p>
<p>It is so much fun that I sometimes need to convince him to go outside and play.  A few weeks ago I said to him ""some kids are stuck in hospital rooms and can only dream of running outside to play football.""</p>
<p>In a moment of insight that only an 8 year old can have, Jake told me ""I bet if they were having fun playing this (our football card game) they wouldn't.""  </p>
<p>After explaining that he had missed my point - we both agreed that it would be nice to share our ""fun"" game with sick kids at the Children's Hospital.  Jake added that to make sure they realized how cool football was - we'd give them packs of football cards also.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Everyone Wins</h3>
<p>The children at the hospital will win and you will also win.  For as little as $7 you will get a game that will bring you a lifetime of fun.  I'm not just saying this - you will really enjoy playing the game with your family or even alone.  When your iphone batteries are dying - you'll pick up a deck of cards and just start playing.  The rules are complex enough that you are simulating a realistic football game, but simple enough that anyone can play and quickly memorize the basics. If you like football, sports in general or just playing card games - you will truly enjoy playing this game.</p>
<p>Pick the level of giving that is right for you, but please realize that you will be getting a great game and helping put a smile on many children's faces.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How the money will be spent</h3>
<p>Jake wants to be able to bring games for any children who want to play.  We can print the rules on our home printer, but they will require a regular deck of playing cards and so we need to be able to buy those.  He loves collecting football cards and reading the stats - so he thinks it is an important gift also.  Everyone likes football cards.  The other kids can be inspired to invent their own games and use the cards to represent the players when playing Jake's card game. We will spend the money we get on a few things</p>
<ul>
<li>Decks of playing cards</li>
<li>Packs of football cards</li>
<li>some 'other' toys/gifts for the children who don't like football </li>
<li>Delivery of the games to the most generous supporters</li>
</ul>
<p>Please trust us that every penny you contribute will go to the cause.  If there are only $300 of contributions we will buy just enough and choose carefully.  If we raise Jake's goal of $100,000 we will make sure sick kids all around the country get something.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Please help spread the word</h3>
<p>I hope that this campaign can be successful to inspire Jake to do more in the future.  We teach him that every one can make a difference and a successful campaign will help him to truly understand.  </p>
<p>My network of friends is a respectable size, but I know that if a few of you can post a link on your networks - we can reach thousands of people.  Whatever you can do to spread the word would be awesome.  Thanks.</p>

Please trust us that every penny you contribute will go to the cause.  If there are only $300 of contributions we will buy just enough and choose carefully.  If we raise Jake's goal of $100,000 we will make sure sick kids all around the country get something.
 


Please help spread the word
I hope that this campaign can be successful to inspire Jake to do more in the future.  We teach him that every one can make a difference and a successful campaign will help him to truly understand.  
My network of friends is a respectable size, but I know that if a few of you can post a link on your networks - we can reach thousands of people.  Whatever you can do to spread the word would be awesome.  Thanks.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Welcome to my campaign for 3D MMORPG Parkour game.
I’m Temo Kokiashvili an indie game developer, working in unity game engine almost 5 years.
I have worked as a freelancer on some game projects, have done several starter kits and I'm lead programmer of ""Spate"" the game which was winner of IGN show ""The Next Game Boss"". Now I want to create my dream game.
With your support we can create amazing game together.  

The game will free to play, MMORPG style with realistic environment, where you’ll be able to create your own characters, make them tall or small, athletic or fat, dress them as you wish with different style of shirts, trousers, shoes and accessories.



Interact with other players and challenge them in side by side running from point A to B.




Each player will have their level and it will increase when player wins the challenge, gets new clothes or tricks. Special clothes, accessories and tricks will be able to buy with coins which you exchange in real money or win in challenge. Each cloth will increase some type of abilities. Player will have speed, flexibility, stamina and strength values. High level players will have access to higher level clothes, accessories and tricks.
The winner of challenge will be determined by points. Player will be given different points for different tricks, harder ones will give more points. But main goal will be finishing first, it'll give much more points then any other tricks. The winner will be awarded with coins and his/her level will increase. If player crashes, of course he/she will loose.
Here are basic features which will be implemented definitely, more features will come along, for example you'll be able to exchange coins in training to increase any  ability (speed, flexibility, stamina, strength ), team challenge, social network integration etc.
Basic Features:



Generate your character with different body parts


Manipulate face and body shape


Change skin and cloth colors


Dress up character with different style of clothes and accessories


Buy special clothes, accessories, tricks


Interact with other players 


Challenge in side by side running

Crashing system


The game would be done in unity game engine which gives power to make more realistic and believable animations with it’s new animation system called “Mecanim”.

The game will be targeted to all 3 main platforms: Windows, Mac, Linux and it'll be completed around quarter 4, 2014.
 
So long I’m working alone, doing everything started from parkour to music, 3d modeling, texturing, programming. For this time I have only little test scenes, with my character doing some tricks and flips and interacting with environment. It’s a very basic movement system for now, but all these takes much time for one person. And the amount which I'm asking is a minimal to buy motion capture (mocap) system and hire few people to create high quality game and deliver it to you as quick as possible.

update 26.08.13
Now the environment got some realistic look and character system has improved too, but it is still very early stage and your help is really needed to make this happen.



 

You’ll get cool perks:

<p>Our team here at Elemental Zeal Game Studios consists of one lead artist, Amanda Reuillon, and one lead programmer, Zack Licastro. We have been working as hobby game designers for a few years now. As we are currently enrolled in University, and being eaten by our part time jobs, we often can’t put as much time or money into our game design as we’d like.</p>
<p>We are asking for your help so that we can ease the burden of bringing our newest game, Fishy Warfare, to both Windows PCs and Xbox Live Indie Games. </p>
<p>In Fishy Warfare, you play as a toy submarine, battling other toy submarines, all inside an everyday aquarium. As you play, you’ll unlock new submarines, and be able to purchase various different components to upgrade your submarine in combat.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Fishy Warfare emerged into this world as our entry to the 2012 Indie Speed Run game development competition. Although it didn’t win a prize, it did end up with 4 ½ stars out of 5. You can try the version that we created in 48 hours for that over at <a href=""http://www.escapistmagazine.com/content/indie-speed-run/?game=150"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.escapistmagazine.com/content/indie-speed-run/?game=150</a> and watch our development vlog at <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfRyG1vpAS8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfRyG1vpAS8</a>.</p>
<p>We want to have a lot more content in the full release than we had for the competition, including new submarines, weapons, bosses, and even new aquariums to battle in.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What We’re Asking For...</strong></h2>
<p>We are only asking for $750 dollars, as we don’t expect the entire process of game design to be paid for by others and are willing to sacrifice our own time and money to get the job done.</p>
<p> We decided on flexible funding as we are going to finish the game no matter what, the extra funding just allows the release date to be brought forward in time, and allows us to put the amount of content and time into the game that it deserves.</p>
<p>Any extra funding that we can’t squeeze into the game will go directly into allowing the company to stay affordable while we continue to develop our skills and grow.</p>

<h2><strong>What Else Have You Done?</strong></h2>
<p>Although we are still a very new company, we have already entered a bunch of game development competitions. This includes three different Ludum Dare Game Jams, and now, the 2012 Indie Speed Run competition. We have even taken two older projects to market on Windows PC and Xbox Live Indie Games. This means we have a bit of experience with releasing projects, and we will certainly use what we have learned when we release this one.</p>
<p>You can see some examples of some prototypes we have programmed, along with some of the previous competition games we mentioned, in our 2012 demo reel here: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_rS6zdoAqo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_rS6zdoAqo</a></p>

<p>We want the opportunity to continue learning and improving our skills, and there is no better way than to continue making projects we love.</p>
<h2><strong>What’s Left To Do?</strong></h2>
<p>Although we have most of the important work done, we still have lots of little things left to do to complete Fishy Warfare.</p>
<p>This includes:</p>
<p>-        A few bug fixes/menu changes</p>
<p><strong>-        About half the game content art  - Finished!</strong></p>
<p><strong>-        More components for your submarines  - Finished!</strong></p>
<p>-        Rebalancing all the new components</p>
<p><strong>-        Special behaviours for the remaining bosses and special submarines  - Finished!</strong></p>
<p>-        Creating more audio tracks for the games bosses</p>
<p><strong>-        Rewriting the sound engine - Finished!</strong></p>
<p>-        Porting to the Xbox and making the trial version</p>

<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h2>
<p>If you like what we are doing, but are unable to contribute, you can still help by telling people about our campaign, or just show your support by following us on twitter, and keeping an eye on our website elementalzeal.com for news on releases and future projects.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Update #1</h2>
<p>Just a small update for today: Fishy Warfare’s sound engine has been rewritten, and is working a lot better.</p>
<p>Our music before (as seen in the Indie Speed Run competition version) would only allow for changing of songs once a currently playing song was finished. This resulted in you being half way through a boss level before the boss music start to play. The music would have to finish it’s current loop before muting would have an affect on it.</p>
<p>Now the music fades in much more nicely when it’s expected and sounds stop immediately when muting occurs. :)</p>
<p>We also wanted to mention that we’ve already had some good suggestions from people viewing our campaign. One suggested feature was nicer “death” animations when a fight is over (getting to watch your submarine sink a little in defeat). This will now be added to the game.</p>
<p>We are always open to more suggestions, so feel free to leave any thoughts in the comments of our campaign, at our twitter page (<a href=""http://email.indiegogo.com/wf/click?upn=wQ6VmGRgxtGdC-2BLpvCc-2F7SDFI9JIg5CmVIGDt3m3TfQCdzK2-2BAP1YW0vk7NbzE5N_uoQOw53Jnd2odJf4vBwXdQ6hYAbn9Bod0a6mdr4EpypOCqIPPsKcQxr7IZuDXFvmfLBz4POPF3kxkVjFIv9DMSHiVTe4EZ8mTMHtpIqoSY4EXR6mAffH1-2BXwncKdWi4aJI1S5TbUpjaxWyNiXqveAiySmJF9AW-2BEZ1E9dVPrE9Mn3i7qRbioqlD1TNpFQm438wq82MOQ4bxB7SRwcGvFyw-3D-3D"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://twitter.com/ElementalZealGS</a>), or through our website’s contact page (<a href=""http://email.indiegogo.com/wf/click?upn=O9Dddo3du7B4OkC0c23AVxvq-2BycmUQj1TGir9XGNYvgaTZFXG2-2FySr-2BjSP41uNgb_uoQOw53Jnd2odJf4vBwXdQ6hYAbn9Bod0a6mdr4EpypOCqIPPsKcQxr7IZuDXFvmfLBz4POPF3kxkVjFIv9DMVHLakSBj-2B8BmS9BOJaibSnDj44fdyIQ9aFa6-2F2c2LmCmsMXSslooCDqp68GnXYiwn16Dv-2FxLgEQJHi-2BLjPq7ujLvguhxThs7BvSzF8dzl-2FolqVSnNicHHwChHbSFX1TJg-3D-3D"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://elementalzeal.com/contactUs.php</a>).</p></div>","Who Are We, and What is Fishy Warfare?
