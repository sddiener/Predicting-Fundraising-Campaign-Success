</ul><p><strong>Who is Guest House Theatre? </strong></p><p>Guest House Theatre is a professional theatre company based in Madison, WI. We are an ensemble of Madison-area theatre artists.

We want to bring stories and characters to the stage that reach outside ourselves and reach into our community. We want our audiences to be our guests, to know that when they enter our house, they will be able to connect with experiences that not only resonate with them, but exposes them to the experience of others in their community and beyond. </p><p><strong>Why support Guest House Theatre? </strong></p><p>Guest House Theatre will add a needed small professional theatre company to Madison’s evolving arts community. Small professional--sometimes called ""store front""--theatres are a vital part of a thriving performing arts culture. And while Madison has a significant community theatre community, and respected larger companies like Forward Theatre Company and Children's Theatre of Madison, we saw a need for a ""store front"" sized company. A company like Guest House provides more opportunities for locally based professional artists while also creating an outlet for new and lesser seen playwrights.</p><p>Why is this necessary now? Because Madison is a growing, evolving city. Census estimates show the city's population has grown to over 250,000...almost a 20% increase since 2000. This growth is transforming the city. Already, Madison has the eyes of the region and nation turned towards it because of its growing bio and medical technology industries,  its thriving culinary culture, and it's lifestyle amenities. We want to be a part of turning those eyes toward Madison’s arts community, helping to solidy Madison’s status as a thriving, growing city. </p><p>One way to do that is by giving talented artists more reasons to plant roots here, the same way the core ensemble members of Guest House Theatre have. We live here because we choose here, and we believe great art can come from here. </p><p>Why can we succeed? Because all members of this company have extensive arts backgrounds. They have managed and founded theatre companies, acted and directed on stages large and small, taught aspiring performers, written plays that have a national profile, and worked for and attained high level degrees in theatre arts and management. We bring decades of experience and training to the table, combined with an intimate knowledge of the Madison area.</p><p>Are there risks? Of course. There are few new ventures that begin without risk. One of ours is that Madison is growing fast, but it’s still a small city. Will it support a growing number of professional theatre companies? Will the city increasing embrace the performing arts the way that embraces other cultural options, like music and restaurant culture.</p><p>Also, it will be critical for us to connect with existing major arts funders in the region.

<p> </p>
<p>Hi there! We're <strong><i><a href=""http://www.companyoffoolstheatre.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Company of Fools</a>. </i></strong>Allow us to introduce ourselves.</p>
<p><strong style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">ARTISTIC STATEMENT:</strong><br/><strong>Company of Fools </strong>is an independent, Latino-founded and run contemporary theatre company committed to community, social engagement, and innovation. We strive to constantly challenge the limits of our own ability, study, understanding, and advocacy. To this end, our mantra for our art is: <i>Dare to fail gloriously</i>. Our brand, our methodologies, and our spirit does not shy away from challenge or change. We are always willing to push the absolute edge of our capabilities as artists, teachers, and creators. Our willingness to push past the fear of failure can and must lead to unheard-of success.</p>
<p><strong>MISSION STATEMENT: </strong><br/><strong>Company of Fools</strong> is a contemporary theatre company with a threefold mission: </p>
<ol>
<li>to present powerful, thoughtful, redemptive, and invigorating productions of 20th- and 21st-century texts;</li>
<li>to commission, create, develop, and produce new, original works; and</li>
<li>to empower new voices, new artists, new communities, and new perspectives throughout our various artistic pursuits.</li>
</ol>
<p>Inspired by the Shakespearean Fool, we strive to maintain a humorous but worldly outlook on our work. Our community is our lifeblood, and our artists and collaborators are our family. Please feel free to reach out anytime by emailing info@companyoffoolstheatre.com. </p>
<h3>What We're Doing</h3>
<p>At the beginning of quarantine, Company of Fools was the first independent theatre company to sponsor and produce virtual staged readings. We've spent the last few months building community, connecting with other artists, and gearing up for the reopening. And we're anxious and eager to get back onstage! So we're producing one of our favorite plays: Rajiv Joseph's brilliant <strong><i>Gruesome Playground Injuries</i></strong>. Never heard of it? Well, i<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">t’s not your typical love story. Doug and Kayleen meet in the nurse’s office in their elementary school; she’s got a painful stomach ache, and he’s all banged up from a running dive off the roof of the school. Over the next thirty years, these scar-crossed lovers meet again and again, brought together by injury, heartbreak, and their own self-destructive tendencies. With great compassion and humor, Rajiv Joseph (Broadway’s <i>Bengal Tiger at the Baghdad Zoo)</i> crafts a compelling and unconventional love story about the intimacy between two people when they allow their defenses to drop and their wounds to show.</span></p>
<p><u><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">And there are a few things different about our show, too!</span></u></p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, this is a multi-disciplinary presentation: a piece of immersive theatre paired with an independent painting exhibition by <a href=""http://www.bjmiller.nyc/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>New York artist Brittany Miller</u></a>. We invite you to join us back at the theatre with a powerful and redemptive return to Company of Fools’ unique brand of work. We'll be staging a production that moves all around our audience in partnership with Culture Lab LIC at Long Island City's beautiful Plaxall Gallery.</p>
<p><strong>Second, </strong>we have an excellent space to use for the production! The space is flexible, conveniently located, and beautiful. Not only that, the multiple gallery spaces make for a brilliantly immersive experience, an exciting method of demonstrating multiple disciplines, and a coming together of artists that aren’t possible elsewhere. Our production hopes to partner with Plaxall and Culture Lab in order to reach out to the local community as well as the NYC artistic community at large. The local LIC community has been hit hard by the global pandemic, and the artistic community in NYC has as well. We would like this production to be an opportunity for multidisciplinary artists and the community at large to come together in recognition of how far we've come.</p>
<p><strong>Third, </strong>we're excited to be bringing together those multiple disciplines into one cohesive production for a low production cost. We're not a billion-dollar Broadway enterprise (and we're proud of it...), but we're committed to bringing you excellent, high-quality off-Broadway work in person or at home.</p>
<p><b>Not ready to be in a theatre yet? </b>No problem -- we'll also be streaming this production online on all of our production dates! So you can tune in from the comfort of your own home as well and join us as we come back to the theatre.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Alright, here's the fun part. We need your help!</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise <strong>$5,000 </strong>to fully fund our production, pay our fees, and get butts in the seats! As you may know, ticket costs can never fully cover the cost of producing a show iN New York City. That's why we need your help. The funds raised here will pay for <strong>artist and production team salaries, rental fees, rights &amp; royalties, painting materials, props &amp; scenic elements, and miscellaneous transportation costs. </strong>It's very important to us that we pay all members of our team a fair salary for their time and effort, particularly as the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing and some folks are still out of work.</li>
<li>We have a variety of awesome perks, from <strong>online shout-outs to songs to drawings to producer credits and free tickets</strong>! Check them all out in detail down below.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our entire goal, we'll be bummed, but in that case, <strong>all funds raised will go towards artists' salaries. </strong>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Are We Doing This?</h3>
<p><i>Gruesome Playground Injuries</i> as a play charts the intersection of two lives using scars, wounds, and calamity as the mile markers to explore why people hurt themselves to gain another’s love. The wounds and scars that stay the longest are the invisible ones and are often inflicted on the ones we love most, as well as ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>SOME CONCEPTUAL NOTES:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Gruesome Playground Injuries is the perfect show as we come out of the Pandemic Times. It speaks to prolonged absences and how they impact relationships. It also speaks to the common bond that connects all of us in these times: trauma and our recovery. But it does it with humor and kindness.</li>
<li>This production will lean into the minimalist elements of the play, and showcase the art of “play"" that lives inside all of us. </li>
<li>In between scenes, actors will move about the Plaxall Gallery space, showcasing the more intimate moments of their relationship in an almost “dreamlike” sense; the feelings that remain even in the times they are apart, much as many of us are experiencing right now.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are definitely some challenges we're all facing. And here are some of ours.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Money. </strong>Obviously, we all know that things are tight right now. And good art costs money. CoF is of the opinion that good art doesn't have to cost millions of dollars, which is why we're raising such a modest amount. That being said: we can't do it on our own! And that's where you come in.</li>
<li>
<strong>COVID-19 Stuff. </strong>As New York City's arts sector slowly starts to reopen, there are a lot of hurdles to navigate as far as keeping everyone safe and healthy. We're uniquely equipped as a company to handle this, having worked independently in small spaces throughout the city and run our own front of house for all of our past productions. We'll keep you safe and healthy, and make sure everyone has a great time doing it!</li>
<li>
<strong>Equity. </strong>Company of Fools wants all artists to be treated fairly and paid equitably. We're a Latino founded and run company with a passion for employing folks from all backgrounds. Our board is gender and ethnically diverse and so is our production team, from playwright to management to cast.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Listen, we understand that things are crazy right now. Don't think you can spare some change for our project? That's okay! There are other great ways you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Make some noise! </strong>Tell your friends about our campaign and encourage them to help us however they can. And tag us (@foolsco) and use our hashtags on social media: #fiveyearsoffools #CoF #CoFgruesome #gruesomefools</li>
<li>
<b>Volunteer! </b>Reach out to the members of the team to help out. We're looking for assistance with front-of-house, ushering, and other complications we need to navigate as a result of COVID-19 protocols.</li>
<li>
<strong>Share! </strong>Use the Indiegogo share tools to blast all your friends about the campaign. :)</li>
</ul>
</div><p> </p><p>That's all we have for you right now. If you have any questions before you donate, don't hesitate to reach out. And don't forget to read all about our great perks. Thanks in advance, and stay safe!</p></div>","Who We Are

We need to raise $5,000 to fully fund our production, pay our fees, and get butts in the seats! As you may know, ticket costs can never fully cover the cost of producing a show iN New York City. That's why we need your help.

We have a variety of awesome perks, from online shout-outs to songs to drawings to producer credits and free tickets! Check them all out in detail down below.
If we don't reach our entire goal, we'll be bummed, but in that case, all funds raised will go towards artists' salaries.

Gruesome Playground Injuries is the perfect show as we come out of the Pandemic Times. It speaks to prolonged absences and how they impact relationships. It also speaks to the common bond that connects all of us in these times: trauma and our recovery. But it does it with humor and kindness.
This production will lean into the minimalist elements of the play, and showcase the art of “play"" that lives inside all of us. 
In between scenes, actors will move about the Plaxall Gallery space, showcasing the more intimate moments of their relationship in an almost “dreamlike” sense; the feelings that remain even in the times they are apart, much as many of us are experiencing right now.


Risks & Challenges
There are definitely some challenges we're all facing. And here are some of ours.


Money. Obviously, we all know that things are tight right now. And good art costs money. CoF is of the opinion that good art doesn't have to cost millions of dollars, which is why we're raising such a modest amount. That being said: we can't do it on our own! And that's where you come in.

COVID-19 Stuff. As New York City's arts sector slowly starts to reopen, there are a lot of hurdles to navigate as far as keeping everyone safe and healthy. We're uniquely equipped as a company to handle this, having worked independently in small spaces throughout the city and run our own front of house for all of our past productions. We'll keep you safe and healthy, and make sure everyone has a great time doing it!

Equity. Company of Fools wants all artists to be treated fairly and paid equitably. We're a Latino founded and run company with a passion for employing folks from all backgrounds. Our board is gender and ethnically diverse and so is our production team, from playwright to management to cast.


Other Ways You Can Help
Listen, we understand that things are crazy right now. Don't think you can spare some change for our project? That's okay! There are other great ways you can help:


Make some noise! Tell your friends about our campaign and encourage them to help us however they can. And tag us (@foolsco) and use our hashtags on social media: #fiveyearsoffools #CoF #CoFgruesome #gruesomefools

Volunteer! Reach out to the members of the team to help out. We're looking for assistance with front-of-house, ushering, and other complications we need to navigate as a result of COVID-19 protocols.

Share! Use the Indiegogo share tools to blast all your friends about the campaign. :)

 That's all we have for you right now. If you have any questions before you donate, don't hesitate to reach out. And don't forget to read all about our great perks. Thanks in advance, and stay safe!",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div>
<p>About that story.  Our reluctant hero Tobias is forced far from home after a tragedy only to triumph against evil and return home to rediscover his roots.

<div>
<p>Staging this magical musical is going to cost money, and it's not a production company, it's just me. I already have many people lined up who are giving their time and talents for free, but we want to pay as many people as much as possible. I'm working for free and the show is not going to take a profit - all of the money we raise will go into the show and to help raise money for our charity partner, the St Bernard Project. </p>
<p>Example costs:</p>
<p>- Licensing and royalties (around $750 per show)</p>
<p>- An orchestra of young local musicians (around $8,000 for rehearsals and shows)</p>
<p>- A professional principal cast - again, locally sourced ($5,000)</p>
<p>- A musical director, choreographer, lighting director and a stage manager ($6,000)</p>
<p>- Audition and rehearsal space ($2,000)</p>
<p>- Set design ($3,000)</p>
<p>- Publicity, so that we can involve as many people as possible ($1,000)</p>
<p>The entire budget will likely come in at around $30,000, some of which will come from ticket sales, but we also need to raise some of this money up front - the good news is we have some amazing rewards!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The staging of Tobias and the Angel brings people together. It is a true example of what beloved New Orleans ambassador Wendell Pierce calls ""the transformative power of art"". And as a bonus, we employ a large number of local musicians and artists, AND best of all, the city gets to see an incredible show. </p>

So why donate to MATYCHAK's #2in2 Campaign?

Let's be real -- it is hard to make it as an artist anywhere, let alone in New York City. But we are fearless! This opportunity came on the heels of being one of 16 choreographers selected to participate in DEVICES: Choreographic Intensive (CHIN), a mentoring program of Doug Varone and Dancers, made possible with generous funding support from the New York Community Trust.  The program is supported, in part, by public funds from the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs, in partnership with the City Council and presented in partnership with the 92nd Street Y. WIthout CHIN, Lacuna would have never been.


We also have some amazing things in the works other than our show at Dixon Place. We have been invited to show excerpts of Lacuna at the pushing progress 2015 Showcase at The Salvatore Capezio Theater at Peridance on February 22, 2015 and the WestFest Top Floor Festival at Westbeth's Martha Graham Studio Theater between April 30, 2015 - May 3, 2015.

With Risk comes Reward . . .

This is not our first time at the rodeo. In 2011, MATYCHAK [formerly known as BANGdance]  exceeded it's goal of raising $1,000 on  Indiegogo towards production costs for our first professional performance as part of DanceNOW NYC's Joe's Pub 2011 Festival at The Public.


We will also be holding an open rehearsal to help raise additional funds for Lacuna on Saturday, March 28, 2015 from 6pm-8pm at Gibney Downtown (280 Broadway, entrance on Chambers Street). Come and have some tasty snacks and a speciality cocktail inspired by Lacuna designed by Norwood Club mixologist Taylor Nathe (who just so happens to be the love of my life, so don't forget to tip!)   
Low on green, but still want to help? 

Times are tough -- don't we know it! But there are other ways you can help besides donating money. You can get the word out about our campaign via social media websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr and Instagram. Just use the hashtags #MATYCHAK #2in2 and the Indiegogo share tools found on this page.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

We are a not for profit community arts group in Rockford IL. We are very excited to be the selected city for this years Rustbelt Midwest Regional Poetry Slam. The Rustbelt Midwest Regional Poetry Slam is the biggest slam poetry competition in the Midwest. It attracts 100 of the nation's best spoken word artist competing for word dominance! It does not have funding and so each years host city is in charge of raising their own funds. This is a once in a lifetime event for the City of Rockford! These amazing poets will be pulling all the stops to show this town  just how incredible spoken word can be. In return, we want to show the rest of the Midwest just how awesome Rockford can be. This is a 2 day event, June 19th and 20th. It will be held at several of Rockford's best local businesses. This is a free event but a suggested donation of $5.00 going to all local charities is advised. Rockford Certified Slam wants to use this as a chance to help our local businesses, charities, art community, and the city as a whole. Your contribution will make this entire event happen. Every penny counts and we would love to show the world how important this art form is. We are bringing people together for the love of words. Won't you join us?</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need to gather $2000.00 to hold the event.

<p>We will have some amazing perks for those that are caring and donate to our cause. We will have 5 tiers of perks and every single one of them will be completed by our local poets.</p>
<p>If we do not receive all the funds in this campaign we will use what we do receive towards the above listed things and work on other inventive ways to make up the difference. Even if we have to do a bake sale/ car wash every weekend until the event. No matter what we will make this amazing event happen.

We want our audiences to be laughing one minute and crying the next!</p>
<p>Back in 2013 we toured a comedic adaptation of Shakespeare's classic tragedy 'Macbeth'. We looked to not only entertain but also challenge the stigma and increase understanding of mental health.

Premiering at the New York International Fringe Festival in August 2015, SOLINA is the story of young girl who awakens to Rooster’s call and discovers Sun is missing and everyone she loves is trapped in a deep sleep, peacefully unaware. She ventures into the darkness to speak to the creatures of the night, encountering false trails, riddles, and dangerous characters on a quest to find Sun and save the world from darkness.

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Both musically, and visually, SOLINA takes our greatest skills and pushes them to the limit. Although kid-friendly, it is a twisted and unconventional fantasy intended for all audiences. The story’s main theme challenges the antiquated concepts of “good” and “evil” too often oversimplified in children’s theatre. In SOLINA, like in life, all characters possess both good qualities and evil qualities, and our strong, female protagonist learns this as she ventures out on her own for the first time. It’s a lesson essential to children, but as Little Did goes on this journey to write, build and fund our first fully original full-length show in New York City, we are learning just how vital and ageless it is.</span></p>

We are happy to discuss the details of our budget with any potential donors if you want to reach out to us at littledidproductions@gmail.com. The basic formula is this:

By helping us to get to our Goal of $3,000, you maximize our potential income from private donors

By helping us to get to our Reach Goal of $5,150, you maximize our potential to balance our budget after ticket sales

Anything raised beyond our Reach Goal will go to further performances of SOLINA





Your Donation...



...would make you a member of the Little Did team, a Giving Tree, and a dear friend.

Our agreement with our fiscal sponsor, Fractured Atlas, makes it so that the donations that go through this campaign will be tax-deductible (above the cost of your rewards) because they will go directly to this project, SOLINA. We will not use any part of it on administrative costs or anything not directly related to the creation of this show, a journey story that will empower children, inspire audiences, and invigorate theater, puppetry and music communities in New York and beyond.






Let's be Friends...


If you cannot donate (or even if you can), please consider sharing on your social media outlets!

Please ""Like"" and ""Follow"" us for updates that include sneak peeks of the digital content being offered as rewards, short films and #eyebombs that we've been leaving around the city, slowly turning our community into a giant puppet!


Both musically, and visually, SOLINA takes our greatest skills and pushes them to the limit. Although kid-friendly, it is a twisted and unconventional fantasy intended for all audiences. The story’s main theme challenges the antiquated concepts of “good” and “evil” too often oversimplified in children’s theatre. In SOLINA, like in life, all characters possess both good qualities and evil qualities, and our strong, female protagonist learns this as she ventures out on her own for the first time. It’s a lesson essential to children, but as Little Did goes on this journey to write, build and fund our first fully original full-length show in New York City, we are learning just how vital and ageless it is.",3.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Who we are:<br/>
</h3>
<p>LightBox Theatre Company is a non-profit theatre company
committed to providing quality, professional live entertainment, for Turlock’s
children and youth. Through public and school based performances we seek to
provide opportunities for all of our community’s youth to be entertained,
enlightened, and inspired. We strive to be one of the first steps in instilling
a life long love of the arts for the members of our community.  <br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We currently produce two shows, one
in the fall and one in the spring. Our first production in October 2015 will be  a stage adaptation of the well-known children's book <i>Bunnicula</i>.  By producing stage adaptations of popular
children’s literature we are able to integrate our programming with the
curriculum of K-12 educators. By partnering with local civic organizations,
such as the Carnegie Arts Center, we provide affordable opportunities for
educators to introduce their students to the stories they have been
reading in class in a new way -- through live performance. When moving beyond
published stories, we seek collaboration with local cultural groups to develop new
works that highlight and celebrate the favorite stories or legends from our
community’s diverse population. <br/></p>
<p>LightBox
Theatre Company is excited about its role in the lives and imaginations of
Turlock’s youth. As we grow, we envision becoming a larger fixture in our
community, participating in civic events, and forming lasting partnerships with
educators and local businesses. We are a small company with big dreams, not
just for ourselves but for our community as well. Come grow with us!</p>

<h2><b>Welcome to our page and thank you for taking the time to find out more about our project!</b></h2>
<p><b>We are <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/dido-aeneas-research-development-and-beyond/www.nmtautomatics.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NMT Automatics</a> and we are seeking support for our new show <i>Dido and Aeneas</i>; an adaptation of Virgil’s ‘Book Four’ of <i>The Aeneid</i>.  It will fuse dance, theatre, and a soundtrack that combines Purcell’s original music with a new electric, industrial soundscape. </b></p>
<p>The first stage of which is a two week Research and Development period, taking place in September, which will include <b>active engagement and participation with Redbridge and Deptford community youth, </b>culminating in a public and industry showcase.</p>
<p>Via a contemporary retelling of this ancient story, we aim to explore cultural intolerance in the 21st century: the conflict between old morals and current attitudes. </p>
<p>Ultimately, we wish to produce a piece that not only is <b>artistically great but also</b> <b>benefits the communities </b>that we are working in.</p>
<p><b>You can be a part of this!</b></p>
<p><b>Research &amp; Development:</b></p>
<p>Set within a period of industrial change, we will experiment with object manipulation, using raw materials to create a visually dynamic performance space and an arresting soundscape. This will be the first time Purcell’s opera has been juxtaposed with a modern metallic score specifically to create a theatrical soundtrack. </p>
<p>We will be working with four actors and two youth groups - Redbridge Youth theatre (South Woodford) and Uncover Youth (Deptford) - who by participating in three workshops and performing with us in the showcase will directly impact on the artistic quality, diversity of ideas and accessibility of the piece, and also provide the opportunity for personal development on their behalf. We aim to find a home for a January production that would not only be informed by the communities within which we have worked, but also have them performing within it. </p>
<p><b><i>“Aeneas, the Trojan hero, is shipwrecked on the enemy shore of Carthage. Brought to the widowed Queen Dido, he woos her with stories of war and hardship. On a dark and stormy night an evil spirit sends a message of intolerance and hatred to Aeneas, persuading him to leave Dido and continue his journey.

<p>Development began in January 2014, with a sharing critiqued by “Remotegoat:” ‘the sort of storytelling that should be encouraged in the arts’. With feedback, the show was re-worked for a month long Edinburgh run at C Too, achieving five stars from <i>Broadway Baby</i>: <b>‘</b>A kill shot… bold and exciting’ and four stars from both <i>The Stage</i> ‘A visual statement’ and <i>The Skinny  </i><b>‘</b>The visuals and the story are brilliantly done’. Finally, it was selected and further refined for the So and So Arts Club Festival (London) in November. </p>
<div>
<p><b>The Story So Far...</b></p>
<p>We have since begun work on this, our next project: <i>Dido &amp; Aeneas</i>.</p>
<p>On consultation with an industry figure, we decided to begin the project with Research and Development which would not only benefit the quality of the production but would also put us in a better position when seeking funding from the Arts Council. </p>
<p>As such a couple of months ago, we did a walking tour of appropriate theatres and community spaces around London, in order to seek space-in-kind and support for this R &amp; D. We set up a number of meetings which <b>brilliantly resulted in being offered space at three venues - <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/dido-aeneas-research-development-and-beyond/www.redbridgedramacentre.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Redbridge Drama Centre</a>, <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/dido-aeneas-research-development-and-beyond/www.greenwichtheatre.org.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Greenwich Theatre</a> and <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/dido-aeneas-research-development-and-beyond/deptfordlounge.org.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Deptford Lounge</a>. </b></p>
<p>Once we had the venues with us we were then in a stronger position with our Arts Council bid which we immediately set about working on. Suffice to say the application took a lot of time and refinement to get it to where we were happy with! </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Arts Council in fact turned our initial bid down. However the feedback was that it was a strong application, it just needed more specifics in terms of the engagement with the youth companies. We have since amended the application and are very much hoping that with that, it will get accepted (we find out mid August). This of course, is a big if. </p>
<p>So we have to look into other sponsorship, which is where this crowd funding site comes in.</p>
<p><b>The Budget...</b></p>
<p>We have asked the Arts Council for £7,680, this total includes payment of all creatives at equity level, including 4 actors, ourselves, the producer and dramaturg as well as £750 for the remainder of The Deptford Lounge who gave us a discount of 40% on their space (we're there for a week and they wanted the showcase as well). </p>
<p><b>This project goes ahead with or without the Arts Council funding since we already have the space and generous support of the venues and people involved.</b></p>
<p>However if the bid is turned down again, we would lower the budget significantly and use whatever we manage to raise to pay for the Deptford Lounge and at least a small amount to the creatives and actors involved.</p>
<p><b>So we're looking at raising £2750, which would allow us to do this. </b></p>
<p><b>On the other hand… </b><b>If We Get Arts Council Funding:</b></p>
<p>Your support will go towards the funding of the full January production (3 weeks rehearsal, 3 weeks run), and all of its costs including: building hire, creatives, set, and costume. As you can imagine the cost of a full production is significantly more than two weeks of R &amp; D so <b>any help we can get, the better! </b></p>

</div>
</div><br/></div>","Welcome to our page and thank you for taking the time to find out more about our project!
We are NMT Automatics and we are seeking support for our new show Dido and Aeneas; an adaptation of Virgil’s ‘Book Four’ of The Aeneid.  It will fuse dance, theatre, and a soundtrack that combines Purcell’s original music with a new electric, industrial soundscape. 
The first stage of which is a two week Research and Development period, taking place in September, which will include active engagement and participation with Redbridge and Deptford community youth, culminating in a public and industry showcase.
Via a contemporary retelling of this ancient story, we aim to explore cultural intolerance in the 21st century: the conflict between old morals and current attitudes. 
Ultimately, we wish to produce a piece that not only is artistically great but also benefits the communities that we are working in.
You can be a part of this!
Research & Development:
Set within a period of industrial change, we will experiment with object manipulation, using raw materials to create a visually dynamic performance space and an arresting soundscape. This will be the first time Purcell’s opera has been juxtaposed with a modern metallic score specifically to create a theatrical soundtrack. 
We will be working with four actors and two youth groups - Redbridge Youth theatre (South Woodford) and Uncover Youth (Deptford) - who by participating in three workshops and performing with us in the showcase will directly impact on the artistic quality, diversity of ideas and accessibility of the piece, and also provide the opportunity for personal development on their behalf. We aim to find a home for a January production that would not only be informed by the communities within which we have worked, but also have them performing within it. 
“Aeneas, the Trojan hero, is shipwrecked on the enemy shore of Carthage. Brought to the widowed Queen Dido, he woos her with stories of war and hardship. On a dark and stormy night an evil spirit sends a message of intolerance and hatred to Aeneas, persuading him to leave Dido and continue his journey. When she hears of Aeneas’ plans, Dido is distraught and builds a great fire, secretly planning her own death.”
A Bit More About The Company:
NoMansTime Automatics updates classical texts giving them relevance to a modern audience, fusing dance and drama and taking music as a primary source of inspiration. Stylistically, the company uses corporeal, poetic and surrealist imagery through physical theatre and text-based storytelling. 
This will be the second full production that we have created following the the reformation of the company by Artistic Director Jonathan Young in 2014.
The first wasThe Orpheus Project: new writing inspired by the Orpheus myth and Kafka’s The Trial, using two performers, an original soundscape, and a unique physical style in a dystopian setting. 

Development began in January 2014, with a sharing critiqued by “Remotegoat:” ‘the sort of storytelling that should be encouraged in the arts’. With feedback, the show was re-worked for a month long Edinburgh run at C Too, achieving five stars from Broadway Baby: ‘A kill shot… bold and exciting’ and four stars from both The Stage ‘A visual statement’ and The Skinny  ‘The visuals and the story are brilliantly done’. Finally, it was selected and further refined for the So and So Arts Club Festival (London) in November.

Amongst the vineyards and quaint cottages, my brother and I were allowed to explore and grow our burgeoning creative talent. We spent many happy hours planning, filming and editing our own short movies. For my friends, I wrote detailed scripts, brimming with enthusiasm and overflowing with dialogue. Looking back, perhaps they more closely resembled short, disorganised novels!

Even though, as a child I was more timid and calm by nature, performing gave me a great deal of confidence and equipped me with an intoxicating new way to express the feelings I had hidden. As well as benefiting me, my dream became the crafting of a highly relatable performance, facilitating a shared experience of catharsis in the audience, an outlet for all the joys and sufferings we experience as humans.</p><p> </p><p>Deep down, I always knew I wanted to live an interesting and adventurous life, I felt such joy performing and inspiring people. I have found my gift and have devoted myself to its development as far as monetary constraints have allowed me. I love to lift people, to help them transcend the troubles of their lives, even if only for a short while, through the universal language of dance.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432978028/sttsbt5xufjgogiw2tao.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>After graduating from high school I was faced with a tough decision, I had to admit to myself that I SHOULD dance, as a CAREER. It was quite hard to admit, since I knew it would be a road paved with financial uncertainty.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, I was determined as I enthusiastically set about auditioning for several prestigious dance and musical theatre colleges in London. My hard work was rewarded by an acceptance from Laine Theatre Arts, one of the top colleges in the country! This was such a giant leap for me, coming from a small German town and suddenly being thrust amongst some of the top talent that the world has to offer, but I thrived on the challenge and really felt myself grow as a person and as a dancer, gaining a solid foundation for my professional ambitions. Yet all the while, the money that the college demanded was a sword of Damocles that hung over my head as I danced. After completing two terms I had to face the reality that I simply did not have enough money to continue. </p><p>It was a valuable experience, with professional training that made me feel alive and that has certainly enabled me to begin, to leave amateurism in the rear view mirror.</p><p>It just saddens me that the arts, an industry that we all depend on to enhance our lives, risks excluding new talent for no better reason than a lack of funds. </p><p></p><p>However, I have NOT been discouraged, only made more determined to succeed and make my contribution to society.

You can find more of my work on youtube and my website:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjZ-gE8wCyZBRUzUqXqNCvghttp://tatirooney.wix.com/tati-rooneyAlthough born in Iceland, for me home was a small town on the banks of the Rhine in Germany. Amongst the vineyards and quaint cottages, my brother and I were allowed to explore and grow our burgeoning creative talent. We spent many happy hours planning, filming and editing our own short movies. For my friends, I wrote detailed scripts, brimming with enthusiasm and overflowing with dialogue. Looking back, perhaps they more closely resembled short, disorganised novels! But everyone starts somewhere, right?I also attended ballet classes twice a week and I LOVED to perform. Even though, as a child I was more timid and calm by nature, performing gave me a great deal of confidence and equipped me with an intoxicating new way to express the feelings I had hidden. As well as benefiting me, my dream became the crafting of a highly relatable performance, facilitating a shared experience of catharsis in the audience, an outlet for all the joys and sufferings we experience as humans. Deep down, I always knew I wanted to live an interesting and adventurous life, I felt such joy performing and inspiring people. I have found my gift and have devoted myself to its development as far as monetary constraints have allowed me. I love to lift people, to help them transcend the troubles of their lives, even if only for a short while, through the universal language of dance.After graduating from high school I was faced with a tough decision, I had to admit to myself that I SHOULD dance, as a CAREER. It was quite hard to admit, since I knew it would be a road paved with financial uncertainty.Nevertheless, I was determined as I enthusiastically set about auditioning for several prestigious dance and musical theatre colleges in London. My hard work was rewarded by an acceptance from Laine Theatre Arts, one of the top colleges in the country! This was such a giant leap for me, coming from a small German town and suddenly being thrust amongst some of the top talent that the world has to offer, but I thrived on the challenge and really felt myself grow as a person and as a dancer, gaining a solid foundation for my professional ambitions. Yet all the while, the money that the college demanded was a sword of Damocles that hung over my head as I danced. After completing two terms I had to face the reality that I simply did not have enough money to continue. It was a valuable experience, with professional training that made me feel alive and that has certainly enabled me to begin, to leave amateurism in the rear view mirror.It just saddens me that the arts, an industry that we all depend on to enhance our lives, risks excluding new talent for no better reason than a lack of funds. However, I have NOT been discouraged, only made more determined to succeed and make my contribution to society. I realised for myself how much I want it, and recent experience has taught me to FIGHT for what I want. I am taking risks and I am not afraid anymore. I am more disciplined than ever.Currently, I have thrown myself back into the maelstrom of auditions for various performing arts colleges around London and Europe, trying to gain scholarships. I have even auditioned for performance positions on cruise ships, along with many people who have already had a few years of professional training. It has given me a lot of confidence.So far I have been accepted by Millennium Performing Arts and the Barcelona Institute of Dance and Bird College. They want me. I have what it takes. But I need the money.No matter what happens, whether I have to work for a few years to save up enough to fund myself, I know I will be successful in the end. Success, does not depend on other peoples perception of what I have achieved, it’s more about staying true to myself and my own goals. I know my life will give me joy and satisfaction, because I will FIGHT for it. I refuse to settle for less ;)I believe every person is SO special and has greatness inside. I feel like I am on the verge of discovering my speciality and what greatness God has placed in my destiny.If you want to help a dancer in financial need, you are very welcome to help me.THANK YOU!!! :)A video explaining my situation:If you want to get to know me better as a person:Contact meFeel free to ask me ANYTHING!

</div><p> </p><h3>Why a Lighting Grid?</h3>
<p>For over 20 years, the 4<sup>th</sup>
floor Mason Hall was just used for storage. 
But in its earlier lifetime, practically since the Peoples Church
building was built in the 1920s, this beautiful space was used as a
theater.  And now it can be again, with
your help.</p>
<p>The Peoples Church of Chicago
is proud of our beautiful building, the Preston Bradley
 Center, and all the
varied activities going on here, from soup kitchen to arts center.  And now we can have plays, dance
performances, cabarets, as we refurbish Mason Hall.  We’re repainting the room and repairing the
ceiling, and most importantly for performance groups, we’re replacing the
lighting grid with state of the art equipment.</p>We have a number of theater and dance groups
already lined up to use Mason Hall – and they need the
grid to do their productions!  We love having theater and art here in our
building, because we believe that art nourishes the soul.  And we need these groups to be here, so we
can keep this historic building open and thriving as a center for arts and
culture, spirituality and community.<br/><br/><p>Help
install this very essential piece of infrastructure in Mason Hall to bring
local, independent theater and performances back into the Preston Bradley
 Center! <br/></p>
<p></p> <p> </p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Refurbishing Mason Hall
includes the new grid, $9,450;  repairing
the sconces, $400; and painting the walls and trim, $770, for a total of
$10,620.  We'll put up a chunk of it,
because this is so important.  We're asking you to help support live,
independent theater on the North side of Chicago
to the tune of $6,500.</p>
<p>In return for your donation,
we're offering fabulous (!) prizes:  supporter buttons, cds of Dr. Bradley's
 inspiring short sermons, tix to future shows, secret tours, photo 
sessions, milestone ceremonies and more!
 </p> <p> </p><h3>The Impact</h3>Reviving this theater/dance 
space will bring a new mid-size performance venue to the North side of 
Chicago.  We value the arts, and with this space available, we will make
 this part of town culturally richer for those who live here, and for 
those who love Uptown's diverse community.  <br/><br/>This new lighting
grid helps address the need for affordable performance space for small dance and theater companies in Chicago. 
 It allows us to offer a ""blank slate"" space, yet with all the 
infrastructure needed for theatrical and dance performances to be 
professionally lit, while remaining affordable. <br/><br/><p>The space 
offers not only a clean, uncluttered performance area, box office 
window, separate dressing rooms, and bathroom and shower for performers,
 but also lets independent artists and small companies bring only the 
equipment they need for their performances.</p><p>This 
versatility will help performing artists of all budget levels present 
their work at a higher production value than they have been able to 
afford up till now.</p>Even if you can't

<p>Ruby, the village's would-be Bohemian, is directing a performance of Henry V to raise money for the local Spitfire fund. Never mind that it has fifty-two characters (most of them men) and that she's never read a word of Shakespeare in her life.

Luckily, Will seems to know just what to say to her (though playing King Henry is quite another matter).

<p>Greyhounds takes something huge - the Battle of Agicourt, the Second World War, Shakespeare's Henry V itself - and confines it (every scene is set in the village hall), bringing to the surface all the simmering tension, subtext, and raw emotion that the English so desperatley try to hide. </p>

<p>We made
the move to the Historic German House last summer, and have had a glimpse at realizing our dream – we pulled
up the carpet to refinish a hardwood dance floor in the ballroom, we have
access to a secondary lesson room and office space for the first time in 10
years, and ButaPub is gracious to open up their downstairs pub for our dances,
also enabling us to have food &amp; drink at our events. Our new space is handicap accessible and ballroom capacity give us something to aspire to.</p>

SISU is in the Heart  is a multi-year, international, community-based theater project about finding family, what it means to call a place ""home"", and a strange Finnish word -- SISU, which is hard to translate, but it means something close to perseverance, overcoming insurmountable odds, or inner personal strength.

<li>You will be listed as a Donor to the Festival and, depending on your donation level, receive other perks and benefits related to the event itself, including private events and performances.<br/>
</li> </ul><div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>Women's voices in the Arts and Theater, in particular, are still struggling to be heard in a field where male playwrights and directors still have dominance. Festival51 has been designed to help levelset that discrepancy and hopefully become an annual event in Rhode Island. <br/><br/>The organizers of Festival51, in conjunction with Mixed Magic Theatre ( <a href=""http://mmtri.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mixed Magic website</a> ) have a collective wealth of experience and talent making them uniquely qualified to successfully mount such an endeavor. Organizers Leann Heath and Terry Shea have been practicing Theater artists for decades, as actors, directors, designers, producers, organizers, marketers and developmental curators. Mixed Magic's Jonathan Pitts-Wiley and Tammy Brown are also Partnering Artists for Festival51 and will aid in curating and selecting the final script candidates. <br/><br/>The talent is in place, scripts have been submitted from all over New England and finalists selected. Your contribution will ensure that the women who produce these final works will have a chance to succeed in their field and have their voices heard in a crowded, often male-dominated landscape. <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>We are aware that many Arts organizations are seeking help and donations in order to survive in a crowded field. Festival51 does not have the kind of name exposure that other, established Arts entities in Rhode Island may have, but we believe that with the right outreach, we can overcome that challenge. Our presence in social media (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/rifestival51"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Festival51 Facebook Page</a>) has already garnered substantial attention and we await a potential RISCA grant. That grant will not be enough to meet projected expenses, however, and producing plays creates financial need beyond being able to pay writers and artists. We believe that with your aid, we can meet our production costs and still be able to provide a modest stipend to those women contributing to Festival51's success. <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Even if your contribution is small (or you cannot contribute at all) please help us by passing the word about Festival51 to anyone you know.

Festival51 has been designed to help levelset that discrepancy and hopefully become an annual event in Rhode Island. The organizers of Festival51, in conjunction with Mixed Magic Theatre ( Mixed Magic website ) have a collective wealth of experience and talent making them uniquely qualified to successfully mount such an endeavor. Organizers Leann Heath and Terry Shea have been practicing Theater artists for decades, as actors, directors, designers, producers, organizers, marketers and developmental curators. Mixed Magic's Jonathan Pitts-Wiley and Tammy Brown are also Partnering Artists for Festival51 and will aid in curating and selecting the final script candidates. The talent is in place, scripts have been submitted from all over New England and finalists selected. Your contribution will ensure that the women who produce these final works will have a chance to succeed in their field and have their voices heard in a crowded, often male-dominated landscape. 
  Risks & ChallengesWe are aware that many Arts organizations are seeking help and donations in order to survive in a crowded field. Festival51 does not have the kind of name exposure that other, established Arts entities in Rhode Island may have, but we believe that with the right outreach, we can overcome that challenge. Our presence in social media (Festival51 Facebook Page) has already garnered substantial attention and we await a potential RISCA grant. That grant will not be enough to meet projected expenses, however, and producing plays creates financial need beyond being able to pay writers and artists. We believe that with your aid, we can meet our production costs and still be able to provide a modest stipend to those women contributing to Festival51's success. 
  Other Ways You Can HelpEven if your contribution is small (or you cannot contribute at all) please help us by passing the word about Festival51 to anyone you know. People can visit us at www.festival51.org or our Facebook page at www.facebook.com/rifestival51. We can answer any and all questions at rifestival51@gmail.com or (401) 285-0351.
 Thank you for your help in making Festival51 a reality and a success!",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Red and Boiling is a whimsical drag and shadow puppet show created by Noga Yechieli Wind and Joshua Rivas about queer womyn and their lives beyond the act of coming out. Do you know what lies behind the flannels and pick up trucks, when they are full three dimensional beings? Drag duo Hasadick and Rosay Ratcheté do. Together they will take you through a world of striking shadow puppetry using comedy and lip sync. Their journey explores the lives of queer womyn and non-binary individuals from different countries, religions, ethnicities, and ages. We premiere this magical piece at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival this August. Come laugh, celebrate and rediscover your identity with us. Based on hours of real life interviews, every performance changes as new testimonies are shared verbatim. If you share your story with us, it might be in our show the next day. Red and Boiling is like soup, a pot of queer stories, a pinch of drag, a dash of lip sync, a few slices of comedy, some tears, and, most importantly, salt.</p><p>But that’s not all. The story is never over, because there are too many stories to tell.

It gives us the opportunity reach an audience that is intersectional. Red and Boiling reveals the untold stories of queer womyn from the Middle East to the U.S., and our international testimonies deserve to be seen by an international audience. Out of the dozens of womyn interviewed, most have never seen themselves represented on stage. Hasadick and Rosay are dedicated to amplifying the reality of queer womyn and Red and Boiling provides that space. Not only are we building a queer community, but we are building a bridge to the international queer community.

<p><i>""If people are going to kill themselves, could they at least do it in the privacy of their own homes and away from public transport? Having my train cancelled because you hate life is selfish as fuck! #selfish""</i></p>
<p><i>00:00</i> (pronounced 'zero hundred hours') is a look at what goes on behind the scenes; the people who clean up, sanitise, disinfect, and come into existence after the world has gone to sleep. </p>
<p>Following the lives of workers employed with Network Rail as part of the “Specialist Cleaning Team”, this production examines the collateral damage and impact of railway suicides. From train drivers to social media managers, from commuters to the decontamination crew, <i>00:00</i> will take the audience on a witty high-speed kaleidoscope journey beneath the façades we wear; mental health, society, masculinity, and messy aftermaths in modern Britain. </p>
<p>Previously performed at The Old Court Theatre in Windsor to critical acclaim, <i>00:00</i> now returns to Egham for <strong>a three-day run at The Packhorse, with evening performances on 7th, 8th and 9th December 2018</strong>. It aims to raise awareness of social issues such as toxic masculinity, the changing face of human interaction, and perceptions of lesser-known mental health conditions. This production reanimates and restores hidden perspectives to the public consciousness, and to provide a glimpse into environments that remains inaccessible to the majority of society. It reflects the lack of empathy we see still prevalent around us, through found text and devised ensemble movement. This production also aims to highlight pertinent underground social issues, and to give a voice to those unheard and unseen. We hope that the perspectives presented in this performance would resonate with audience members, and generate further constructive debate and discussion. It encourages every individual in the audience to cease taking people for granted, and to re-examine their relationships and reactions to such tragic events. </p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Why us?</h2>
<p>This is a COMPLETELY independent, original, full-length professional show, and we need all the help we can get!</p>
<ul>
<li>We have staged this show before, and would now like to make it bigger and better, and more engaging for our audiences.</li>
<li>As we are unaffiliated with either the Students' Union or Royal Holloway University's Drama department, we do not have the same funding or support that other productions on campus get. </li>
<li>Thus, we are crowdfunding and trying to cover our costs of buying props and set items. </li>
<li>We are not out to make massive amounts of profit, 10% of all ticket sales will be donated to the charity organisation Samaritans (they feature in the play quite a bit). </li>
<li>All contributions, regardless of it being £1 or £100, will aid us immensely in bringing this show to life, and no amount is too small to go unappreciated! </li>
<li>If 10 people donated £10 each, it would be £100 altogether and that's no small feat.</li>
</ul>
<p>We feel that this show is especially important in this day and age (and worth any monetary contributions), as we are exploring and presenting relevant and topical issues in a new and exciting way. We won't spoil the show for you, but both the text and set design is going to be unconventional, and the show would be staged outside the Packhorse pub across the road from the university campus which is an interesting change from the usual theatrical spaces. All financial contributions will help us to stage the best possible show we can, and to do justice to issues that still affect people in society to this day. </p>
<p> </p>

<ul>
<li>Black cloths to transform the venue into an atmospheric and intimate performance space</li>

<li>Any travel costs incurred in transporting gear and equipment to and fro</li>
<li>Creating/mailing perks claimed by our lovely Indiegogo contributors </li>

<strong>Pay all actors and crew members</strong>, who have spent so much time and effort making it all possible.</li></ul>
<p> </p>

<li>Hilarious movie/train posters Photoshopped with cast and crew members' faces, signed.</li>
<li>Free tickets, and a chance to talk personally to the cast and crew after the show regarding the play and the performance (post-show discussion and Q&amp;A if you so wish).</li>
<li>Signed and annotated copies of the director's script (our director is fond of doodling so you can expect to see an interesting variety).</li>

This production reanimates and restores hidden perspectives to the public consciousness, and to provide a glimpse into environments that remains inaccessible to the majority of society. It reflects the lack of empathy we see still prevalent around us, through found text and devised ensemble movement. This production also aims to highlight pertinent underground social issues, and to give a voice to those unheard and unseen. We hope that the perspectives presented in this performance would resonate with audience members, and generate further constructive debate and discussion. It encourages every individual in the audience to cease taking people for granted, and to re-examine their relationships and reactions to such tragic events. 
 

 
Why us?
This is a COMPLETELY independent, original, full-length professional show, and we need all the help we can get!

We have staged this show before, and would now like to make it bigger and better, and more engaging for our audiences.
As we are unaffiliated with either the Students' Union or Royal Holloway University's Drama department, we do not have the same funding or support that other productions on campus get. 
Thus, we are crowdfunding and trying to cover our costs of buying props and set items. 
We are not out to make massive amounts of profit, 10% of all ticket sales will be donated to the charity organisation Samaritans (they feature in the play quite a bit). 
All contributions, regardless of it being £1 or £100, will aid us immensely in bringing this show to life, and no amount is too small to go unappreciated! 
If 10 people donated £10 each, it would be £100 altogether and that's no small feat.

We feel that this show is especially important in this day and age (and worth any monetary contributions), as we are exploring and presenting relevant and topical issues in a new and exciting way. We won't spoil the show for you, but both the text and set design is going to be unconventional, and the show would be staged outside the Packhorse pub across the road from the university campus which is an interesting change from the usual theatrical spaces. All financial contributions will help us to stage the best possible show we can, and to do justice to issues that still affect people in society to this day. 
 

What We Need & What You Get
We need the money to purchase/rent:

Black cloths to transform the venue into an atmospheric and intimate performance space
A projector
Lamps for lighting (performing in complete darkness is all well and good but we don't want to be TOO immersive)
Set items such as rostrums and gravel 
Printing materials such as tickets and programme booklets
Any travel costs incurred in transporting gear and equipment to and fro
Creating/mailing perks claimed by our lovely Indiegogo contributors 

And most importantly, enough money to:

Pay all actors and crew members, who have spent so much time and effort making it all possible.
 
A sneak peek of what's up for grabs as perks for contributing (depending on the amount given):

A signed scrapbook that includes an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the rehearsal process, photos of rehearsals and the show itself, train tickets collated by cast and crew, along with funny and interesting stories/memories attached to the journey on the ticket, amongst other content.
Hilarious movie/train posters Photoshopped with cast and crew members' faces, signed.
Free tickets, and a chance to talk personally to the cast and crew after the show regarding the play and the performance (post-show discussion and Q&A if you so wish).
Signed and annotated copies of the director's script (our director is fond of doodling so you can expect to see an interesting variety).
Credit on programme booklets and shoutout on social media.

That's not even half of what we offer, click on the individual tiers on the right to see what else we have (or contribute some money to find out).
 

 
The Impact
By contributing to our project, you will be:

Enabling us to ensure that our production is the best that it can be.
Supporting an entirely independent theatre company made up of poor students with big dreams.
Helping us to compensate everyone involved in this passion project with some financial renumeration for their blood, sweat and tears.
Allowing the different voices in the play - all seldom heard or seen - to be brought to the surface, hopefully engendering a more understanding and empathetic community.

<h3>Who</h3>
<p>We are a scrappy startup founded by a group of Fredonia Alumni in August of 2016. Our alma mater instilled the idea of making your own theatre and exploring who you are as an artist. Shellscrape Theatre Co. works under the belief that the uniqueness of the individual is at the core of all theatrical expression.</p>
<h3>What</h3>
<p>Miss Julie is the final production of our inaugural year and is a contemporary interpretation of August Strindberg's original play. This story was adapted by our Artistic Director (Hey Elaine!) in order to be more accessible to our audiences. Our cast is working together to create a new ending for Miss Julie that breaks away from its traditional and unfortunate outcome.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution directly translates to the opportunities we provide our artists. At this stage in the production process, we have a team of 14 young theatre professionals from actors to technicians. We hope to increase this number by including photographers, designers and critics to further the quality of the show and to provide a chance to gain hands on experience. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Our fundraising goal of $2,000 will go toward the following: </p>
<p>Performance venue - a multipurpose warehouse in Brooklyn</p>
<p>Rehearsal space - we're working with our friends at Union Street Dance</p>
<p>Marketing - we need effective advertising to make some noise</p>
<p>Our artists - receive a stipend for their time and dedication to the project</p>
<p>Props and costumes - sourced from local merchants to support our community</p>

<h2><strong>What</strong></h2>
<p>Cake is a transcontinental, cross Atlantic oceanic cyberworld creation built on google docs, facetime and a seasonally shifting time difference.  </p>
<p>It’s is an attempt to understand how the hell you’re supposed to be comfortable naked.</p>
<p>It’s frosting and fluid and so much hair, just... ahh… really just everywhere. In your mouth and your butt crack. Really, it’s... it’s everywhere.</p>
<p>It’s been hours researching how people can fall in love with bridges.</p>
<p>It’s plastic wrap.</p>
<p>It’s is what it looks like when your sense of self is taught to you solely through rom-coms.</p>
<p>It may be messy.</p>
<p>It will be delicious.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Who</strong></h2>
<p>Cake is an international collaboration between Australian theatre artist Caitlin George and NYC based Shellscrape Theatre Company. Caitlin and Elaine Rava, Artistic Director of Shellscrape, met during their 9 months training in New York with Anne Bogart’s SITI Conservatory 2016-17. In December 2017 Caitlin returned home having plans to meet Elaine the following year for the first staging of their joint collaboration, Cake. With the assistance of Shellscrape members Brittany Partridge (Producer) and Angela Wheeler (Marketing Director), Cake will soon make its world premiere at the Melbourne Fringe Festival. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>Your contribution will go towards the necessary costs of staging a show in Melbourne, Australia. This first staging will be the world premiere of Cake but in no way the end of the journey. In 2020 after further development we plan to take Cake back home to New York, whilst simultaneously mapping out it’s European Fringe Festival tour. Your support on this first major step of this project will mean we have the financial support to further the longevity of our cross-cultural collaboration and the life of this strange yet delicious slice of theatre!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What We Need</strong></h2>
<p>Our fundraising goal of $1,500 will go toward the following. As you can see our costs for this project are greater than the amount we’re asking for. The extra costs will be covered out of pocket. </p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">ITEM - COST $(AUD)</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">Festival Administration Fee - 345</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">Rehearsal Space Hire - 275</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">Performance Venue Hire - 380</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">Set Pieces/Construction - 240</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">Props/Consumables - 150</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">Marketing/Advertising - 160</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">Technician Hire - 450</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">TOTAL BUDGETED EXPENSES - AUD$ 2,000</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;""> </p>
<p>Project expenses not included are Elaine’s international flights, domestic travel expenses and accommodation. These expenses are being paid for out of pocket and your donations will not go towards their reimbursement.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Note from the Playwright</strong></h2>
<p>Cake began in a tiny diner in Manhattan, which looked as though it hadn’t been touched since 1973. Elaine and I were meeting having searched high and low for any place open and selling doughnuts. 14th Street had failed us so we ended up in said diner. Elaine had some kind of big cookie thing and I chose for myself the biggest piece of marble baked cheesecake I’d ever seen.</p>
<p>Cake and I have a long standing love affair but this slice really took the biscuit. I told Elaine, a close friend and an artist I admire, “We should make a play about a woman who’s in love with a cheesecake. It doesn’t have to do with body image or anything she’s just in love with a cake.”</p>
<p>And dear Elaine replied, “Okay. Let's do it.”</p>
<p>Nearly a full year later, I’ve since moved back to Melbourne while Elaine has directed three other productions with her company, Shellscrape Theatre in New York. During this time, Cake has had many different faces, shifting and writhing about till it reached its current iteration. Throughout all its phases the overarching question has always remained rooted in love. How do we love? How are we taught to love? How do we love another completely and all consumingly yet still keep some love for ourselves? Is that even possible?</p>
<p>I don’t think this play has any of the answers, it’s more all of my incomprehension splattered over 50, hopefully, entertaining minutes. But it’s a very big world, so if I struggle to understand, then surely there are other people out there feeling the same thing.</p>
<p>Love is incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Maybe so is this play.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>This show is risky. It will definitely be going up, that much is for certain but there's no guarantees on success. No one may come. We may not break even. Elaine could get lost at LAX trying to find her connecting flight and spend the rest of her days living somewhere between Terminal 1 and reality. This is also the first full play I've written AND our first time at Melbourne Fringe. But in spite of it all, we've kept going. And now, we're so close I can almost taste that sweet sweet frosting! I'm confident that we'll be able to manage any catastrophes we face.</p>
<p>I'll just get Elaine a map or something. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h2>
<p>Cake is an amazing piece that we hope a lot of people can see!</p>

Nearly a full year later, I’ve since moved back to Melbourne while Elaine has directed three other productions with her company, Shellscrape Theatre in New York. During this time, Cake has had many different faces, shifting and writhing about till it reached its current iteration. Throughout all its phases the overarching question has always remained rooted in love. How do we love? How are we taught to love? How do we love another completely and all consumingly yet still keep some love for ourselves? Is that even possible?
I don’t think this play has any of the answers, it’s more all of my incomprehension splattered over 50, hopefully, entertaining minutes. But it’s a very big world, so if I struggle to understand, then surely there are other people out there feeling the same thing.
Love is incomprehensible.
Maybe so is this play.
 
Risks & Challenges
This show is risky. It will definitely be going up, that much is for certain but there's no guarantees on success. No one may come. We may not break even. Elaine could get lost at LAX trying to find her connecting flight and spend the rest of her days living somewhere between Terminal 1 and reality. This is also the first full play I've written AND our first time at Melbourne Fringe. But in spite of it all, we've kept going. And now, we're so close I can almost taste that sweet sweet frosting! I'm confident that we'll be able to manage any catastrophes we face.
I'll just get Elaine a map or something.

With 3 nominations for his work on musical productions in the last three-years, Dougie knew that creating a platform for himself as an emerging artist and storyteller was essential. This year, while dancing at the historic Jacob's Pillow, he came to the realization that his passion for <u><strong>theater dance </strong></u>(the kind of dancing you see in Musicals) was unique within the dance world. He realized that the greater dance community, including audiences who see dance, aren't exposed to  theater dance- and his mission became clear. He set out to create a Theater-Dance driven company to bring theater dance from the musical stage and into festivals, concert stages and educational centers. He quickly found that his idea was in fact <u><strong>NEEDED</strong></u> in the dance community when he was asked to join the Emerging Choreographer Series in NYC alongside 8 choreographers. He was the only, and first, theater-dance choreographer to present work at this primarily modern dance organization. </p><p>     Rooted in the American Jazz tradition of Jack Cole, DPR Dance is the only dance company keeping this heritage alive. Using his ground breaking technique as  foundation, DPR Dance creates dance that tells stories that entertain, uplift, and move the audience.

<h3>About Innervation Dance Cooperative:</h3>
<p>Innervation Dance Cooperative, also known as IDC, was founded in 1998 by Michael Sherman who sought to bring together like-minded artists to collaborate and create works that entertain, engage, and inspire discussion through storytelling.  IDC strives to create original work by collaborating with artists of all backgrounds and has a focus on giving not only veterans, but new creators a platform to show their work.  This has allowed us to continue to grow into the wonderful company you see here today.

</div><h3>Why We Need Your Help:</h3><p>IDC is a 501(c)(3) non-profit performance organization. This means that we rely on outside sources and show revenue to pay for all the things needed to put on a fantastic show! These things include: rehearsal space, performance venues, educational outreach, costuming, light/sound design, and most importantly paying OUR PERFORMERS! Your contribution will go directly to the local, hardworking artists in the Chicago dance and music communities.</p><h3>What does this show mean to us and why is that important?</h3><p>After jumping completely out of our comfort zone last season with our sold out show, It's My Own Invention, IDC wanted to continue to look for new creative avenues to grow. <i>RUMOURS</i> is near and dear to all of our hearts and is something many of the collaborators involved have always wanted to create. Fleetwood Mac is such a prolific part of music and pop culture history and we all want to make sure we are able to pay proper homage to the artistry they have created. By collaborating on this particular album with Movies About Animals, IDC is bridging the gap between the fields of dance and music in an interesting way;  not only are we performing the songs live and dancing to them, we are working together to create a completely new story and sound from something so well established. In the modern arts world, dancers and musicians are often far removed from one another due to all of the fantastic technology available to us all. On this project, we are getting back to the roots of the relationship between music, dance, and the physical human beings involved in the process. We are meeting in person and creating works side by side for a truly unique experience for everyone involved.</p><h3>How do we make it look so easy?</h3><p>Answer? We DON'T! Putting on a live performance of any kind takes a lot of work! In this case both IDC and Movies About Animals are running into new challenges that we have otherwise never encountered. Some of these are trying to work with an entire cast and company, as well a full band's crazy schedule, making sure that we do not over step our bounds in regards to the use of or changes made to the original work, finding a balance between artistic fields so that both musicians and dancemakers feel fulfilled with the end result and SO many more.  We love what we do and are passionate about creating a community for artists of all backgrounds.

<li>a Roman Catholic prayer to the Blessed Virgin Mary. </li> <li>a new play by Steven Carl McCasland.</li>
</ul>
<div>On a hot summer day in 1964, a young Nigerian postulant arrives at a New York City convent for refuge, prayer and a new beginning. Meanwhile, a 14-year-old black boy has been murdered by a white police officer in Harlem. The streets are raging with riots. The questions that arise in the aftermath of in the postulant's arrival will change the Sisters forever. Join acclaimed playwright <a href=""http://www.broadwayworld.com/people/Steven-Carl-McCasland/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""www.stevencarlmccasland.weebly.com%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Steven Carl McCasland</a> as he draws back the curtain on a private and devout group with his bold, original play <i>Memorare</i>.</div> </div> <div> <h3>How can you help?</h3>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; line-height: 26px;"">Producing a play in New York City isn't easy. And it isn't cheap, either.  Here's just a few of the things we'll need to make it happen:</span></h3>
<div><ul>
<li>Approximately<b> $500</b> to cover the cost of costumes (eight identical habits).</li>
<li>Approximately <b>$600</b> to cover the cost of scenery and props. We are striving to recreate a New York City convent from the 1960's to our best ability.</li>
<li>Rehearsal space isn't easy to come by in this city. And when you find it, it costs you a pretty penny. In order to rehearse <i>Memorare</i>, we'll need to spend around <b>$1,000</b> on studio space alone.</li>
<li>Insurance for the space and for Actor's Equity members (this will be a showcase production) will cost approximately <b>$450</b>. </li>
<li>Renting a theatre for a two-week, 14-performance run will cost approximately <b>$5,000</b>. This includes lighting and sound equipment, along with stock furniture to add to our set and exclusive access to the venue for our two-week booking.</li>
<li>Each actor and tech team member will require a stipend for their time and efforts on the production. We estimate needing approximately <b>$1,500</b> to cover this cost.</li>
<li>Every play requires an audience. Finding them can be tricky - especially when it's a brand new play like <i>Memorare</i>. For that reason, we'll need to spend around <b>$300</b> on publicity items - including posters and postcards. </li>
</ul></div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Why <i>Memorare</i>? Why now?</h3>
<div><ul>
<li>Steven Carl McCasland's critically acclaimed plays have been called ""brilliant"", ""astonishing"", ""inventive"", ""boldly imagined"". <i>Little Wars, What Was Lost, Neat &amp; Tidy, Der Kanarienvogel, 28 Marchant Avenue, Shades of Blue</i> and more have been produced at nearly a dozen theatre. </li>

</div></div>","What is Memorare? 
a Roman Catholic prayer to the Blessed Virgin Mary.  a new play by Steven Carl McCasland.

On a hot summer day in 1964, a young Nigerian postulant arrives at a New York City convent for refuge, prayer and a new beginning. Meanwhile, a 14-year-old black boy has been murdered by a white police officer in Harlem. The streets are raging with riots. The questions that arise in the aftermath of in the postulant's arrival will change the Sisters forever. Join acclaimed playwright Steven Carl McCasland as he draws back the curtain on a private and devout group with his bold, original play Memorare.   How can you help?
Producing a play in New York City isn't easy. And it isn't cheap, either.  Here's just a few of the things we'll need to make it happen:

Approximately $500 to cover the cost of costumes (eight identical habits).
Approximately $600 to cover the cost of scenery and props. We are striving to recreate a New York City convent from the 1960's to our best ability.
Rehearsal space isn't easy to come by in this city. And when you find it, it costs you a pretty penny. In order to rehearse Memorare, we'll need to spend around $1,000 on studio space alone.
Insurance for the space and for Actor's Equity members (this will be a showcase production) will cost approximately $450. 
Renting a theatre for a two-week, 14-performance run will cost approximately $5,000. This includes lighting and sound equipment, along with stock furniture to add to our set and exclusive access to the venue for our two-week booking.
Each actor and tech team member will require a stipend for their time and efforts on the production. We estimate needing approximately $1,500 to cover this cost.
Every play requires an audience. Finding them can be tricky - especially when it's a brand new play like Memorare. For that reason, we'll need to spend around $300 on publicity items - including posters and postcards. 

    Why Memorare? Why now?

Steven Carl McCasland's critically acclaimed plays have been called ""brilliant"", ""astonishing"", ""inventive"", ""boldly imagined"". Little Wars, What Was Lost, Neat & Tidy, Der Kanarienvogel, 28 Marchant Avenue, Shades of Blue and more have been produced at nearly a dozen theatre. 

Memorare premiered in a sold-out reading at The Drama Book Shop to standing ovations and high acclaim.
There aren't a lot of new plays with roles exclusively for women. Memorare will employ EIGHT women, both union and non-union. 

Memorare is an original play that examines a difficult dialogue our country is having about the relationship between our police and young black men & women. We hope that it adds to the conversation and helps us continue to grow from it.

Honoring heritage.</h3> <p></p>The <strong>Trinacria Theatre Company </strong>is a summer exchange program that brings American theatre artists to Sicily for a four-week intensive residency. Our mission is to use theatre 
as
a tool to promote Sicilian history, heritage, and culture at home and
abroad. Over the summer, theatre makers study and work in the beautiful landscape of the Southern Messina region, developing an original piece of theatre based on local folklore and mythology. The final performance will be staged outdoors free of charge in various Sicilian villages, as well as for audiences in the United States. </div><div>
<h3>Who we serve</h3>
<p>For years, the Sicilian countryside was marred by a decline in population, high unemployment rates, and economic instability. Recently, a boost in the Sicilian tourism economy has drawn renewed interest to this island of incredible natural and historic beauty. <strong>Trinacria Theatre Company</strong> hopes to continue this trend by reframing Sicily as a site of pilgrimage for artistic retreat and residency.</p>
<p>Company members from Boston and New York will spend four weeks in the <a href=""http://www.trinacriatheatre.com/location"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rich landscape of Southern Messina</a>, in the seaside villages between the cities of Messina and Catania in a region commonly referred to as Calonerò (from Greek, meaning ""good water""). A group of 8 performers and theatre makers will live and work together as an ensemble to develop a piece of theatre based on <a href=""http://www.trinacriatheatre.com/story"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">local mythologies and folklore</a>. The performance will tour to several local villages for free outdoor performances. The piece will then be performed in the United States at the end of the summer.</p>
<p>We believe that this residency experience will be life-changing for the theatre-makers, dreamers, and creators traveling to Sicily, but we hope that the greatest impact will be on the communities and villages of Southern Messina. The arts are the most important tool for people to share their stories, and we hope that through <b>Trinacria Theatre Company's</b> work, the beauty and history of the Sicilian people can be spread to the global community. Our hope is to create an annual event that draws a renewed interest in Sicilian arts, history, and culture, instills pride in the people of Southern Messina, and draws more artists to this land of extraordinary beauty.</p>

The show will take place as part of the 2016 Edinburgh Fringe Festival and will be performed at theSpaceUK from the 22nd - 27th August. You are all invited to come and enjoy the show!ABOUT:
EYE HIGH THEATRE is a new London-based theatre company founded by Grace Lambert & Grace Strickland de Souza. We use an unconventional and experimental style that looks to re-work classic texts; blurring the lines between artistic disciplines and creating aesthetically and atmospherically innovative work.Through our work we are committed to pushing the boundaries, for example previous shows have included blindfolding actors, spontaneous Charleston dancing, playing in paint and water and performing illusions. 'No Longer A Secret' will be our first ever fringe show and we want the chance to continue surprising and challenging you through our work.PRODUCTION: 'No Longer A Secret' investigates identity, mortality and the dehumanisation of the individual. It is inspired by Frances Hodgson Burnett's 'The Secret Garden' and told through the nostalgic eyes of an old man as he waits in his hospital bed. This deconstructed re-telling is woven throughout with lessons, and questions, original music and a transformative garden. The show was formed as part of a collaborative project involving MA Performance Design and Practice students from Central Saint Martins and other creative artists. We believe it is important to provide a platform for talented individuals through our work.Classic British texts have always been an inspiration in our work. We believe it is important to revive these stories and introduce them to new audiences in an innovative way. After months of reflection and development the show is now ready to enter the rehearsal period and ultimately it will debut at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.BUDGET:In order to make the show a success, your support is crucial. We are looking for funding to help with: accommodation, transport, marketing and production costs. We would be extremely grateful for any support you can offer us. Your generosity will not only be helping to establish our theatre company, but also showcase other artists, composers, writers and designers with whom we will be collaborating. We are looking to raise a total of £7000.

It is a story of love against all odds, of real human connection, of fairy tale love, and of unconventional family. <br/><br/>It is a story for you.<br/><br/><h3>About the story.<br/>
</h3>How We Came Home is written and directed by Jay 
Jacobson, a sophomore at Bard College. It is set to a brand new score 
composed by Bard senior Theo Lowrey, featuring a set designed by Bard 
senior Izzy Bump and a choreographed ballet number by Bard sophomore 
Lila Klaus. It is a collaborative effort between these amazing creative 
forces and its amazing ten-person cast.<br/><br/>It tells the story of 
Louisa, 12-year old daughter of Ellie and Clara, a small family living 
in NYC. When Louisa suddenly stops speaking to them, Ellie begins 
weaving together the story of how Ellie and Clara met into the fabric of
 fantastical bedtime stories: one night, they're battling a Trickster in
 an enchanted forest; another night, they're lost in an underworld that 
seems to go on forever.<br/><br/>As these stories progress, the underlying
 truth begins to shine through, and exploring the fractured relationship between Louisa  and her mothers becomes the focus of the play. It asks us to 
examine how storytelling can heal, how storytelling can bring us 
together, how storytelling can challenge and uplift. It asks us to leave
 our lives behind for a couple of hours and sit by the bed and listen.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>About the campaign.<br/>
</h3>The good news is that one (possibly two!) student-run organizations on campus will be helping us fund this show. The bad news is that even this doesn't leave us with enough money to bring this incredibly gorgeous show to life. To give you a quick idea of the aesthetic we're aiming for, the set is comprised of a hyper-realistic bedroom complete with an actual bed, real furniture, three walls, and a functional door. This base set will be complemented by pink chiffon that will be hung, draped, flung, presented, coiled, and placed all over the theatre, and which will be lit from below by LED lights to change mood. If we reach our goal, we will even be able to suspend working bedroom lamps in exciting and interesting ways all throughout the space. AND, if we reach a stretch goal of $1500, we will send a download link for a recording of Theo Lowrey's score to each of our donors!<br/><br/>

The 3500 we are seeking through Indiegogo are exclusively to pay our actors and musicians for their hard work! We believe that by creating a fair, professional working environment, everyone's experience of the project; actors' as well as audiences, will be so much better than it otherwise would be. Therefore we are not willing to put up a production where this factor is ignored and your help is absolutely vital!</p><p>- In return for your generous support we have listed a few different perks, ranging from a big thank you, to tickets and drinks and all the way to 'executive producer' credits! All donations, big and small, will go towards the goal of making the industry of entertainment a fair place for people to work in and enjoy.

You can be the most talented, ambitious, intelligent person there is, but the truth is, without the cash it's hard work! Starting out is the trickiest bit, because people trust what they know and if they don't know you it's hard to gain their trust. Having secured the rights to stage these three diamonds of theatre we feel that we have the most amazing opportunity now to create the track record we need. All we need to do is to catch people's attention and get them to join  in on the joy!

Then the music and the plays will just gently flow into each other and it would all gather up into a totality of the world of Tennessee Williams.  We are putting it on at the Hornsey Town Hall Arts Centre in Crouch End, London, doing eight performances between the 21st November - 4th December. They have a beautiful space called The Supper Room, which is a very '1940’s cabaret club' looking space with a stage and a bar.What We Need & What You Get- In total for the project we need 10.000. The 3500 we are seeking through Indiegogo are exclusively to pay our actors and musicians for their hard work! We believe that by creating a fair, professional working environment, everyone's experience of the project; actors' as well as audiences, will be so much better than it otherwise would be. Therefore we are not willing to put up a production where this factor is ignored and your help is absolutely vital!- In return for your generous support we have listed a few different perks, ranging from a big thank you, to tickets and drinks and all the way to 'executive producer' credits! All donations, big and small, will go towards the goal of making the industry of entertainment a fair place for people to work in and enjoy. On top of that you will help bringing to life three pieces of incredible work by the one and only Tennessee Williams!The Impact - We are a group of young and ambitious theatre makers with a strong drive to succeed. We have within the last year put on and contributed to four different theatre projects and two film projects, including sartre's No Way Out at the Canal Café Theatre in Little Venice and we are currently putting on a brand new Icelandic play at The Drayton Arms Theatre in South-Kensington to be premiered on the 22nd of October 2015. - With a little bit of help from our friends the future is bright and we believe we have a lot to contribute to the world of theatre and entertainment and are very excited about the coming year, which we see as an opportunity to prove that we can stand by that statement! Risks & Challenges- The main challenge in this world is finances (right?)! You can be the most talented, ambitious, intelligent person there is, but the truth is, without the cash it's hard work! Starting out is the trickiest bit, because people trust what they know and if they don't know you it's hard to gain their trust. Having secured the rights to stage these three diamonds of theatre we feel that we have the most amazing opportunity now to create the track record we need. All we need to do is to catch people's attention and get them to join  in on the joy! Any amounts we might receive above our set goal will go towards dressing up the venue and sourcing the best costumes possible, adding to the detail and magic, to make YOUR experience closer to perfection!Other Ways You Can Help- Having said this, you can help us in so many other ways then contributing money. Give us hand getting the word out by making noise about this campaign (please note the Indiegogo share tools - go social media crazy!), or by letting people know what's coming (the show itself) and simply by looking forward to come to see it yourself!- Please be in touch if you have any ideas and/or questions.

violence continues to be an issue affecting people of all backgrounds in
our communities. January 14, 2016, is opening night of, <b><i>Nobody Knows You as I Do</i></b>,  a powerful play that addresses this
subject.  This worldwide premiere was
written by award winning and renowned Catalan playwrite/director Roger Peña
Carulla.  To make it accessible for
everyone, each performance will be presented in Spanish with English subtitles.</p>
<p>The author,  was
inspired by the incredible amount of domestic violence depicted in the news.
That was the catalyst that propelled him to write this powerful piece that
dissects the mind  and brings to light the
conflicts of both victim and perpetrator. </p>

I’ve been granted a week long residency with Ko Fest in western Massachusetts to kick start the creation of a new show, <strong>“The Last Rat of Theresienstadt”</strong>. They'll provide us a place to stay and a rehearsal room as well as physical support. I’m excited about collaborating with a director, puppeteers, and a composer to tell a beautiful and humorous story about the relationship between a rat (played by a puppet) and a women (played by me) in the concentration camp in Terezin in Czechoslovakia where the arts were abundant and food was scarce.

I’ve been doing mostly self-funded solo work over the past 12 years and am now embarking on a project with a gang! I’ve been granted a week long residency with Ko Fest in western Massachusetts to kick start the creation of a new show, “The Last Rat of Theresienstadt”. They'll provide us a place to stay and a rehearsal room as well as physical support. I’m excited about collaborating with a director, puppeteers, and a composer to tell a beautiful and humorous story about the relationship between a rat (played by a puppet) and a women (played by me) in the concentration camp in Terezin in Czechoslovakia where the arts were abundant and food was scarce. This story has so many parallels to what’s happening in the world today, and with the upsurge of anti-Semitism, this is a perfect story at a perfect time.It’s kind of like a BARN RAISER!

<h3>Context</h3>
<p>On 7th January 2015 two gunmen entered the offices of the satirical newspaper <i>Charlie Hebdo</i> in Paris and opened fire, killing 12 and injuring 13. Al-Qaeda in Yemen took responsibility for the attack, which was a response to the newspaper publishing cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad.</p>
<p>The event was considered by many as an attack not only on <i>Charlie</i> but on free speech in general and sparked overwhelming reactions - including on social medias where the slogan 'Je Suis Charlie' (I am Charlie) was shared by millions. On 11th January millions of people - including 40 world leaders -led a unity rally in Paris and throughout the country.</p>
<p>A few days later the newspaper decided to resume publication with an issue depicting once again the Prophet. This led to many protests throughout the Islamic world, in some cases very violent ones: In Niger, such protests led to at least 10 deaths and injured 170.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About the show</h3>
<p><i>The Charlie Question<i> </i></i>is an original piece by Jonathan Hendry based on the <i>Charlie Hebdo</i> shooting and exploring such themes as freedom of speech and the way we are now used to reacting to such terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>The play is semi-verbatim, mixing interviews (expressing different opinions) taken word-for-word with fictitious scenes giving a different perspective on the event. The interviews were carried out on the UEA campus and in Paris with students, teachers, a bookseller, a newsagent... </p>
<p>We strive to create an engaging show that will make audiences think and especially talk about the topics explored. As a society, we believe it is our responsibility to keep the conversation and debate about free speech going, and we hope this play will contribute to this. To achieve this we will use many visual elements, mirroring the importance of images in the context of the attack. Live drawing will be included in the performance, whilst images and archives will be projected behind the actors.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We will be taking the show to two festivals, the Festival Off d'Avignon (South of France) in July and the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August. This is a very exciting challenge but also an expensive one, which is why we need you to help us get there!</p>

Elle NYTT is structured both as a school and performing company.  The Trinidad location offers dance classes at three locations in Modern, Ballet, Soca, Caribbean Fusion, Hip Hop, Dancehall, Femme Funk and also facilitates studio rentals. At the New York branch, Elle NYTT currently offers a Soca Class at the Mark Morris Dance Center, Brooklyn.  </p>
<p>Elle NYTT’s mission is to support, promote, and showcase distinct dance styles and to develop the dance industry in Trinidad and Tobago, as well as promote Caribbean culture abroad. The company continues to explore and build relationships domestically and internationally encouraging everyone to experience different styles of dance.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>We believe in providing performance opportunities for all the students in our classes.  Our first school show started in the studio in Cascade, and every year we continue to grow, moving to MovieTowne, which had its own challenges when it rained, being an outdoor space, to Jean Pierre Complex which had other challenges with the birds in the venue, and we have also explored Bishops/ Trinity East.  This year we are moving the show back to Port of Spain to Queens Hall.  This is the first time we would have the school production there and the students will get the opportunity to perform in a space specifically designed for theatre.  Of course, this now means that our production costs have increased as well.  So we're coming to you for assistance to make this happen.  It would mean the world to these kids and their families who eagerly look forward to that special moment being on stage.</p>
<p>We have also been longing to do some refurbishments to our studio space in Curepe.  The flooring needs to be redone and we would also like to make some adjustments to the registration and waiting area. Lastly, the studio is unbearably hot especially on a Saturday during the day when we have the majority of our kids classes.  We would love to be able to install air conditioning to make it just a bit more comfortable, not only for the kids, but also for the parents who sit patiently and wait in the sweltering heat.  These costs have proven to be a bit more than we can manage on our own and so we're coming to you for your assistance in this regard.</p>The US$30,000 has been calculated based on the quotations we received for the flooring, air conditioning, refurbishment as well as the budget for our production.  Please note that this budget does not include full payment to Elle NYTT choreographers, teachers and company members, the way we would normally do when we have a company production, as the members will all be contributing this as part of our fund raising efforts.</div><div>
<br/><p>Whether or not we meet this goal, any amounts donated will go towards meeting these costs.  Check out the various perks offered as as a small token of our appreciation for your generous contributions.  The perks range from special thank you notes on our social media, free classes at any of the studio locations, free DVDs of our previous productions, private classes, to photo opportunities with our Elle Team.</p>

<p>The services we offer at Elle NYTT go beyond just dance classes and performances. Dancing as an extracurricular activity can greatly assist in one’s social development and eventually lead to less unproductive hours spent by young adults, not to mention its fitness benefits.</p>
<p>We feel that we have the skills necessary to continue to enrich people’s lives through dance, to inspire and motivate, but we do need your help.</p>For companies selecting the Platinum perk and greater donations, your sponsorship will qualify for a tax allowance of 100% of the amount contributed as our company is registered with the National Registry of Artists with the Ministry of Arts and Multiculturalism. We will also include your company as one of the sponsors both in our program (target audience of 1,400 over the 2 night run of the show), as well as in our online promotion. Our Facebook page now has over 9,800 likes and our profile page has 5,000 friends, in addition to the network of our 30+ company members - a great opportunity to be promoted.  
It should also be noted that Elle NYTT has managed to
attract a diversified target audience as our students and performing members come from

viewership would also come from various socio-economic backgrounds.<p><br/></p>

<div>""A Muslim in the midst"" thus far has been solely funded by its playwright - Anand Rao. Now, we need your help to take the play to the next level. The confirmed shows in September 2016 are at 'Thespis' - a competition and festival that does not share ticket revenues with the performing group. Your donations are not just a much-needed relief but they will be the essential lifeblood that keeps the vital parts of this production running.</div>
<div>Our amazing team of talented cast and crew has already invested a lot of energy and time on the play. We have a line-up of highly talented and trained actors, carefully handpicked to portray the complex characters. They are all eagerly awaiting to demonstrate their craft, and bring the characters to life on stage. </div>

Dear Friends!
Your contribution will go a long way. Every dollar counts. This is a play with a relevant and important message and needs to be shared with the world.

A one of its kind story - ""A Muslim in the midst"" is probably the only play that deals with the immediate aftermath of 9/11 as seen through the eyes of ordinary people outside the United States. The story is set in a city I was born and raised; Bangalore, India. A city that has close connections to the US through its IT industry, and the large expatriate population that calls the city home. The premise to this intense drama is inspired by real events. For your convenience, I have broken down the different donation amounts under various categories but feel free to donate any amount outside of the preset categories (You can click on the amounts listed on the right side-bar to donate). My entire cast and crew will be thankful for your generosity. 

- Anand Rao, Playwright
The Background:
Islamaphobia is neither new nor exclusive to New York City, the United States or for that matter, the world.


With almost 1.8 billion Muslims around the globe (that's about 24% of the world's population), the perception of Muslims and what the attack on September 11th did to help change that view is as much a topic of discussion today as it was in the days following the September 11th attacks. This is a story inspired by true events that takes place half way around the world, and gives life to a moment in history from a perspective never before seen on a New York stage, until now.


Given the climate of todays presidential election, a rise in fear of terrorism following attacks in recent weeks around the world, this play is long overdue and ready to take the New York stage by storm. We want you to be a part of this great debate, this unique tale of what happens when two couples from two very opposing sides of the issue come together as simple human beings, in a moment of kindness and civility, a moment that provides an honest look at being a Muslim stranger, and getting to know one up close.

""A Muslim in the midst"" raises important questions as the characters grapple with their limitations to find answers. A reflection of the times we live in, and the increasing need for discovering a  common fellowship based on humanity and empathy. It's an ongoing debate that transcends cultures and borders.

Synopsis:


September 14th, 2001: On the third day after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, on the streets of Bangalore, India; a poor Muslim family is stranded. Desperate to reach a relative’s home in a distant suburb, the new immigrants to the city are struggling to find a ride late in the night. Watching them closely is a modern Hindu couple, both well-traveled and highly educated executives of American companies. The liberal and westernized executive couple offers to take the traditional and rural Muslim couple along. The conversation quickly takes an unexpected turn as the two world’s collide. Fueled by an intermittent radio broadcast spewing pro and anti-Islamic rhetoric and warnings about potential terror threats, the characters fight within their self-imposed confines of prejudice and fear, in their attempts to look beyond the obvious ideological differences, and unravel a common fellowship based on humanity.

Why we need your help?


""A Muslim in the midst"" thus far has been solely funded by its playwright - Anand Rao. Now, we need your help to take the play to the next level. The confirmed shows in September 2016 are at 'Thespis' - a competition and festival that does not share ticket revenues with the performing group. Your donations are not just a much-needed relief but they will be the essential lifeblood that keeps the vital parts of this production running.
Our amazing team of talented cast and crew has already invested a lot of energy and time on the play. We have a line-up of highly talented and trained actors, carefully handpicked to portray the complex characters. They are all eagerly awaiting to demonstrate their craft, and bring the characters to life on stage. 


Upcoming Shows
Thespis 2016 Theatre Festival, Hudson Guild Theater, 441 W, 26th St., NYC.


Monday, September 12 at 6:15 PM
Friday, September 16 at 9:00 PMSunday, September 18 at 3:30 PM


Now begins the real work, as we start looking at building sets, stage properties, lighting, costume, marketing, and a whole lot of other expensive activities including renting rehearsal space in New York. 

It's our aim to produce a play that stands out not just for its relevance of topic but also for its quality of production. Your donation will go a long way in realizing all our dreams of making sure that ""A Muslim in the midst"" will make a strong world premiere at Thespis 2016, be remembered for a long time, and gets invited for performances at other venues. 

    
We Win, You Win

</p><p><i>The Queen</i><i>,</i> written by Aditya
Rawal and directed by Gwynn MacDonald, will have a run of 12 shows from the
2nd of June to the 19th of June at the iconic Off-Off-Broadway venue, Theater for the New City, in the East Village in New York.<br/><br/></p>
<p><b>THE PLAY:</b><br/>Set
in 16th century India, at the peak of the Mughal era, <i>The
Queen</i> is the story of Durga, who is consigned to the west wing of the
palace after her husband, the Rajput king, marries a younger woman.
She battles against the loss of her beauty and relevance as she resolves to
burn the palace down and avenge her husband’s betrayal. </p>

The play draws inspiration from <i>Macbeth,</i>
<i>Medea</i> and the works of Rabindranath
Tagore. It explores themes of power and the position of
women in society, an issue that in four centuries has not lost its importance.<br/><br/>
<p><b>WHERE YOU CAN HELP:</b><br/>Artists from
minority communities create some of the most provocative art. Despite that, we
are provided with fewer opportunities to showcase our work on the established stage.
In the times we live in, we believe it is even more important to support work
made by artists of colour because the stories we tell today, will become the moral
institutions of<span> society tomorrow. Therefore,  storytelling
must be diverse. By contributing to our production, you don't just support the
creation of art, you also ensure a thriving, diverse culture.</span></p><p></p><p>Most of our collaborators have agreed to work for no fee, or a subsidised fee. Every dollar we save allows us to maximise the quality of our production. Some of our members have
even contributed personal funds towards this project, such is the belief we
share in each others talents and the play.<br/>
<span><br/><b>We are looking to raise funds for
the following:</b><br/><span><b>Rehearsal space<br/><span>Period costumes <br/><span>Set and light elements<br/><span>Publicity and press packets<br/><span>Salaries for cast and crew </span></span></span></span></b></span></span></p>
<p><b>TOTAL: 4000$<br/></b><br/>
If, due to the generosity of our benefactors, we make more than 4000$ dollars,
we will pay our cast, crew and designers the salary that they would normally
command. As is widely known, surviving as an artist, especially in New York
City, is very challenging and as producers we would like to ensure that our
artists and collaborators receive the financial compensation that they deserve.<br/></p><p></p><p><b>THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE PLAY:</b><br/>The 16<sup>th</sup> century
brought about a perplexing situation for the Rajput kings of Rajasthan, who
bore a proud legacy of nobility and bravery. To prevent the destruction of
their kingdoms at the hands of the almighty Mughals, they were forced to accept
Emperor Akbar’s suzerainty, thereby betraying the same legacy that they were
trying to protect.<br/><br/>
<span>The king, Pratap, finds himself in this position when Akbar demands that
he send his army to fight alongside the Mughals, in a battle that has little to
do with the Rajputs. Pratap must use all the resources at his disposal,
including his first wife, Durga, to prevent this.</span></p><p>

<br/></div>","The Queen, written by Aditya
Rawal and directed by Gwynn MacDonald, will have a run of 12 shows from the
2nd of June to the 19th of June at the iconic Off-Off-Broadway venue, Theater for the New City, in the East Village in New York.
THE PLAY:Set
in 16th century India, at the peak of the Mughal era, The
Queen is the story of Durga, who is consigned to the west wing of the
palace after her husband, the Rajput king, marries a younger woman.
She battles against the loss of her beauty and relevance as she resolves to
burn the palace down and avenge her husband’s betrayal. 

The play draws inspiration from Macbeth,
Medea and the works of Rabindranath
Tagore. It explores themes of power and the position of
women in society, an issue that in four centuries has not lost its importance.
WHERE YOU CAN HELP:Artists from
minority communities create some of the most provocative art. Despite that, we
are provided with fewer opportunities to showcase our work on the established stage.
In the times we live in, we believe it is even more important to support work
made by artists of colour because the stories we tell today, will become the moral
institutions of society tomorrow. Therefore,  storytelling
must be diverse. By contributing to our production, you don't just support the
creation of art, you also ensure a thriving, diverse culture.Most of our collaborators have agreed to work for no fee, or a subsidised fee. Every dollar we save allows us to maximise the quality of our production. Some of our members have
even contributed personal funds towards this project, such is the belief we
share in each others talents and the play.
We are looking to raise funds for
the following:Rehearsal spacePeriod costumes Set and light elementsPublicity and press packetsSalaries for cast and crew 
TOTAL: 4000$
If, due to the generosity of our benefactors, we make more than 4000$ dollars,
we will pay our cast, crew and designers the salary that they would normally
command. As is widely known, surviving as an artist, especially in New York
City, is very challenging and as producers we would like to ensure that our
artists and collaborators receive the financial compensation that they deserve.THE HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE PLAY:The 16th century
brought about a perplexing situation for the Rajput kings of Rajasthan, who
bore a proud legacy of nobility and bravery. To prevent the destruction of
their kingdoms at the hands of the almighty Mughals, they were forced to accept
Emperor Akbar’s suzerainty, thereby betraying the same legacy that they were
trying to protect.
The king, Pratap, finds himself in this position when Akbar demands that
he send his army to fight alongside the Mughals, in a battle that has little to
do with the Rajputs. Pratap must use all the resources at his disposal,
including his first wife, Durga, to prevent this.
THE THEATER: Founded in 1971, Theater for the New City (TNC) is one of New York City's leading Off-Off-Broadway theaters, known for radical political plays and community commitment. Productions at TNC have won 43 Obie Awards and the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for Sam Shepard’s Buried Child. Theatre for the New City has served as the home for theatre pioneers such as Richard Foreman, Charles Ludlam, Miguel Piñero, Ralph Lee, María Irene Fornés, Romulus Linney, Harvey Fierstein, and Heiner Muller. A musical adaptation of Antoine de Saint Exupéry’s The Little Prince in 1973 featured Tim Robbins in the title role. The 1976 play Dinosaur Door by Barbara Garson featured a young Vin Diesel.DIRECTOR:Gwynn MacDonald has
directed and produced for the theater, television, film and radio. Her work in
television (MTV networks, Showtime, CBS, etc.) has received both Cable Ace and
Emmy Nominations. Gwynn majored in theater and studied film production at Princeton University.

</div> </div> <div> <h3>LET US ENTERTAIN YOU! LET US MAKE YOU SMILE!</h3> <p>We created and produced MAGIC CITY's very first sketch show, BABIES IN BUSINESS SUITS, entirely on our own. This included creating and rehearsing the show, pitching the concept to our friends at Donny's Skybox, and spending out-of-our-pocket money on advertising and marketing. For LOVE, BLOOD &amp; ROSES, we want to go above and beyond what we already know we're capable of. MAGIC CITY will still bring you top quality entertainment that only MAGIC CITY can provide, but we need your help to financially support this endeavor. <span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>This show has the ability to reach a much wider and larger audience than BABIES IN BUSINESS SUITS did, but we can only do so much within our means. With your financial support, we will be able to market the show more effectively, reaching out to the people we know want to see LOVE, BLOOD &amp; ROSES, but are people we may not be able to access in our current </span>networks. With your help, we'd also be able to have a consistent (and large enough) rehearsal space for our weekly rehearsals, as well as the ability to pay taxes on any of the money we make off of this show. </p>
<p>If you check out our perks, you'll see there are a ton of fun things you can receive, should you choose to you help us reach our goal. This includes custom stickers, MAGIC CITY t-shirts, signed cast pictures and cast member portraits, and going all the way up to us treating you to dinner, the show AND DRINKS! We want to make sure you have the best experience when you come to our shows, and the perks will help us AND you!</p>
<p><b>A BREAKDOWN OF WHERE THE FUNDS ARE HEADED</b></p>
<p><b>Marketing/Advertising</b>: $1000 budget<span><br/></span><span>Facebook Ads, printed posters, flyers, postcards, photos and stickers that will be distributed across the city of Chicago.<br/><span><br/></span><b>Rehearsal Space</b>: $1000 budget<span><br/></span><span>Two rehearsals every week for the month of June in a rented studio that can fit the needs of our extra large cast.<br/><br/><b>Props/Make-Up/Costumes</b>: $400 budget<br/>Our show is going to require a little more props, make-up and costumes than a typical sketch show because of our subject matter. These funds will go toward reimbursing our cast members for any expenses they may have in their thrift-store clothing and drug-store make-up endeavors.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span><b>The Rest of the Money</b>: $600 budget<span><br/></span>The rest of the money we raise will go toward any unforeseen costs we may have in the production and run of the show, but also in making sure MAGIC CITY is able to pay off taxes for any of the money it makes off of its show. Extra money will go into a slush fund that will cover taxes, festival applications and online digital content projects. And if we are able, shelling out funds to our cast because we believe in paying artists for their valuable time, energy and efforts.<br/><br/></span></span></p>
<p>We understand that money is not always an easy thing to give away. That's why in the event we don't reach our goal, we'll still do everything we can to go above and beyond to bring you the best sketch show ever. <span><br/></span></p> </div> <div> <h3>BUT WHAT MAKES US SPECIAL!??!</h3> <p>OK, OK. We've asked for your moneys, but why should you bother helping us? <span><br/></span></p>
<p><span>Aside from giving MAGIC CITY the ability to pay for more effective advertisement, rehearsal spaces and reimbursements for make-up/props/costuming—as well as helping us cover our tax butts—contributing to this campaign offers MAGIC CITY not only the chance to endure, but to grow and flourish. </span></p>
<p><span><span><span>At the heart of MAGIC CITY is the love of play and giving people the opportunity to work and perform with joy. MAGIC CITY is about being able to walk into the room and CREATE art that is funny, relevant and honest to who we are not only as performers, actors, directors, writers, but as humans. It's about creating work you believe in with people you love working with. </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16px;"">For LOVE, BLOOD &amp; ROSES, we are bringing in 9 incredibly talented guest artists to help bring this project to life. This brings our cast to a total of 16, but in a totally cheesy-corn-puff-way, this is us growing our family. </span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Should we meet our goal, we will be able to build the foundation needed for MAGIC CITY to truly succeed. Funds that are not used specifically for this show will go to other MAGIC CITY endeavors which include building a website for online digital content, applying and performing for festivals, future shows and so much more.</span></span></span></p>

<div><span>WE'LL BE OK! We've done this before and we did it pretty damn well. It stung a little bit, but we've got the ability to bounce back from any obstacles we may encounter because we've got a strong team. <span><br/></span></span></div>
<div><span><span><br/></span>We may not be able to have the audiences we're hoping to have and we may not be able to reimburse ourselves for out-of-pocket costs, but we're scrappy.

</h3> <p><i>Gaybraham Lincoln</i> is a satirical musical detailing the state affairs and affairs of state surrounding the American civil war.

<p>Expanded from an original script by Jared Corwin and songs by Jacob Minter, <i>Gaybraham Lincoln: The Musical  </i>was developed under dramaturg and director Gabriella Carr, culminating in a student-run production at Ithaca College in December of 2013.

Looking back at the four years we've been at TUHS, we have collected many great memories and close relationships in our school community and as a dance department. Because we've been able to do what we love and create art in addition to our academic studies on a day to day basis, our high school experience has been deeply meaningful. </p>
<p>We are working so hard to make our final performances at TUHS the best they can be —  from the dancing to the costumes to all of the behind the scenes work that goes into producing a concert. We've been studying and refining our understanding of the repertory and technique of George Balanchine™. We will be performing Martha Graham technique at the company's historic Westbeth studio theater. Not least of all, we are preparing intensively for our final concerts on May 12th &amp; 13th. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary We are currently in our last few months of attending Talent Unlimited High School as dance majors. Looking back at the four years we've been at TUHS, we have collected many great memories and close relationships in our school community and as a dance department. Because we've been able to do what we love and create art in addition to our academic studies on a day to day basis, our high school experience has been deeply meaningful. 
We are working so hard to make our final performances at TUHS the best they can be —  from the dancing to the costumes to all of the behind the scenes work that goes into producing a concert. We've been studying and refining our understanding of the repertory and technique of George Balanchine™. We will be performing Martha Graham technique at the company's historic Westbeth studio theater. Not least of all, we are preparing intensively for our final concerts on May 12th & 13th. 


George Balanchine™  is
a Trademark of the The George Balanchine Trust©. All rights reserved.    What We Need & What You Get We are launching this campaign to fund the purchase of new costumes for our Spring Concert. Your donation will go a long way towards bringing our vision of a professional looking concert to life.   We are looking to raise $1500 that will go towards the purchase of new costumes. Any funds raised in excess of $1500 will be paid forward to the following classes of dancers at TUHS.
No donation is too small. Give what you can. Any amount helps.  Check out our perks! For the $150 and $200 levels, you can receive tickets to see Miami City Ballet or NYC Ballet at Lincoln Center.  Your donations are tax deductible. We have partnered with Pentacle Dance's Behind the Scenes program, which is providing 501(c)(3) fiscal sponsorship.     The Impact The connections we have made with each other are unlike anything else. We have danced together, struggled together, laughed together and this will be the last time we will be able to perform together on the TUHS stage. We would love for you to come and support the Talent Unlimited dance department and experience our love of the arts.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Set in a mystical and violent 16th century Prague, Broken City uses a percussive and eclectic score to tell the story of a young woman named Noa, who impersonates a legendary mud creature in an attempt to inspire her people to fight back against the oppression they've been facing. When things do not go as planned, she and her brother Daniel end up on opposite sides of a war and must choose between loyalty to their cause and loyalty to each other, until one is forced to make the ultimate sacrifice to fix their beloved city.</p>
<p>We (Dylan and Melissa) originally wrote Broken City as our thesis musical at NYU Tisch's prestigious Graduate Musical Theatre Writing Program, and we're very excited to continue working on it alongside our wonderful director, Gina Rattan, and our friends at Monday Theatre Company. If you ask us, musical theatre could use a few more feminist superhero stories, and we can't wait to introduce ours to the world. </p>
<p>These demos and this reading, which will take place on December 2nd, are the best way for us to get our work out there, but we can't do it without your help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our funding is going to two places: the demos and the reading. For the demos, we were able to find time in a recording studio that we didn't need to pay for, but we still need to compensate the incredible singers, instrumentalists, and audio engineers who contributed their time. For the reading, we need money for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compensation for the Director, Stage Manager, Music Director, and Actors</li>
<li>Printing of scripts and scores</li>
<li>Rental of rehearsal and performance space</li>
<li>Other miscellaneous rehearsal costs</li>
</ul>
<p>In exchange for your contribution, we are prepared to offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>A special shout out on our website and Facebook page ($5 contribution)</li>
<li>A shout out and an MP3 of one of our demo tracks of your choice ($10 contribution)</li>
<li>A shout out and MP3s of three of our demo tracks of your choice ($25 contribution)</li>
<li>A shout out and MP3s of all six of our demo tracks ($50 contribution)</li>
<li>All of the above and dinner with the creative team ($100)</li>
<li>All of the above and a song written by Melissa and Dylan just for you ($500 contribution)</li>
<li>All of the above and a co-producer credit ($1000 contribution)</li>
</ul>
<p>If we are unable to reach our goal, the funds will either be used to fund as much of the reading as possible or be saved for a future reading once we've been able to raise enough money through other channels.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe this show has a lot to contribute to the world. First of all, it was written by two women, it's directed by a woman, and the producers of this reading are women... which is still pretty rare in the musical theatre world. On top of that, the hero of our story is a woman, and, *spoiler alert* she spends the vast majority of the show talking about things other than men, including when she's talking to other women (which is a lot of the time, seeing as two of the other three principle characters are also women).</p>
<p>It's also the story of an oppressed cultural minority's journey to empowerment, and what with the year/decade/240 years we've been having in this country, that's something we could all use a little more of. Our hope is that our story will remind people that there is always something that can be done to effect change, while still being joyful and exciting to watch.</p>
<p>We received a lot of positive feedback on the show back at NYU, and we've done so much work on it since then, so we're sure audiences would get even more out of it now.</p>

<ul>
<li>Theater Rental (We use one of Ft Worth's most prestigious stages!)</li>
<li>Microphones (We want every parent, grandparent and guest to hear every well rehearsed, well deserved word.)</li>

<h3>Where we are and where we want to go</h3>
<p>We go above and beyond for this program. Our kids experience everything about Musical Theatre, from set and stage design, costuming, acting, and direction. We strive for the best theatre experience that these kids can possibly get.  Our children's productions are not ""extras"" to help help fund our major productions. Our children's classes ARE our major productions! Our ONLY Productions. With your help, we can give each child a more amazing experience than the last. This is our 4th year and we have grown, and will continue to grow with your help! We have preformed <i>Wizard Of Oz</i>, <i>The Little Mermaid</i>, <i>Annie</i> and in production now for <i>Into The Woods</i>. Next season we would love to grow even more and offer more scholarships and more programs for many more kids and teens who need a fresh diverse outlet.</p>
<h3><strong>Why is this so important? </strong></h3>
<p>We offer the exception to the norm. Diversity, culture and acceptance, so that these children can see their worth and become the amazing young people and adults they deserve to have the chance to be. These are the kids that will change the world for the better. Help me give them that future.</p>

We go above and beyond for this program. Our kids experience everything about Musical Theatre, from set and stage design, costuming, acting, and direction. We strive for the best theatre experience that these kids can possibly get.  Our children's productions are not ""extras"" to help help fund our major productions. Our children's classes ARE our major productions! Our ONLY Productions. With your help, we can give each child a more amazing experience than the last. This is our 4th year and we have grown, and will continue to grow with your help! We have preformed Wizard Of Oz, The Little Mermaid, Annie and in production now for Into The Woods. Next season we would love to grow even more and offer more scholarships and more programs for many more kids and teens who need a fresh diverse outlet.
Why is this so important? 
We offer the exception to the norm. Diversity, culture and acceptance, so that these children can see their worth and become the amazing young people and adults they deserve to have the chance to be. These are the kids that will change the world for the better. Help me give them that future.

Other Ways You Can Help
Some just can't monetarily contribute, we get it! But that doesn't mean you can't help:
You can share this campaign with friends and social media.
You can send a ""Break a Leg"" message to the kids for opening night in April by visiting and giving our Facebook page a ""like"" @ facebook.com/mtddc

 Collective’s production of William Shakespeare’s <i>King Lear</i> is a 
site-specific and promenade production where audience and actors travel 
together through a rural Iowa farm just after the 1980s farming crisis. 
Installed in an industrial Chicago farm and fueled by an original singer
 songwriter score, this political rendering of Lear looks at the play 
through the eyes of the daughters and asks: how can we free ourselves of
 our societal coding and simply connect?<br/><br/><h3>Who Are We? </h3>Eleusis
 Collective is dedicated to creating ""a space for the female imaginary.""
 Eleusis is a Chicago-based company that explores issues of gender, 
identity, and representation through performance, literary, and 
multimedia arts. In summer 2012, we launched our first project in the 
community of Rutland, VT, implementing a theatre arts workshop for local
 high school girls. In fall 2012, we produced an original play called 
<i>The Last Sleepover</i> at the Chicago Fringe Festival. In spring 2013, we 
tackled the Chicago premiere of Sam Holcroft's <i>Vanya,</i> exploring 
Chekhov's characters (especially female) through a contemporary lens in a
 unique site-specific production in Logan Square.<p></p><h3>What We Need and What You Get:</h3><p>We are asking for a collaborative effort to raise $11,000. These funds go directly into the production and are critical to making <i>King Lear </i>happen.</p><p>We have a Production team of 10 people. Each of these individuals work collaboratively (and tirelessly) to promote the experience of the show and build its community. We need funds to pay our collaborators, support our community partners and spaces, and reach our potential audience members.</p><p>The funds allocated to the Design team (5 people) are crucial for the environment of the production, and will serve to create and maintain a fully immersive and electrifying experience including live music and an installed world on an urban farm. </p><p>The cast of <i>King Lear </i>is a group of 12 talented actors that will bring the timeless words of Shakespeare to the stage. Already in rehearsals, these actors are dedicated to the rigorous technique required by Shakespeare's language while asking the big character questions to build a seamless world. </p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>With your help, we can make our dreams of <i>King Lear</i> a reality, and provide a truly unique theatrical experience that challenges the traditional paradigm, and infuses a classic text with an exciting contemporary sensibility.  A big part of this production is engaging with community and we are tackling four community conversations to increase awareness and visibility of local organizations, especially urban farmers. </p><h3>Our Partners<br/>

<h3>Catherine</h3>
<p>     Hi, my name is Mackenzie Jennings and I am a sophomore at a school of the arts located in Raleigh.  Recently, I finished writing my pride and joy, <i>Catherine.</i> And that is the reason why I have made this campaign. My goal for this campaign is to gain money for my production, so that I may perform it at a nearby theatre. As a high school student, I do not have enough money to rent the theatre, create costumes and to be able to buy props. With your help, I can raise this money. If I reach my goal, I would be thrilled! I thank you for your time, and please, consider donating for our cause.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Will Get</h3>
<p>     If we are to be able to perform this play, we will need $6,500 overall. I have budgeted everything with this in mind, and it would be the perfect number. If you can donate a specific amount to our cause, preferably a large amount, but I understand that money is tight, you can receive a perk.  At the moment, there are only three perks. If you donate $50, then you will receive a signed playbill. If you donate $100, you will receive a free disc, with the recording of one our performance. If you donate $200, you can get a free ticket to our matinee showing. At this time, however, I am not sure if I will reach my goal, so where will all the donated money to if I do not reach my goal? The donated money will still be used. I put this campaign in a flexible budget, because every single dollar that goes into this campaign is extremely precious to me.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>     This play is important to me, as it hits close to home. Everyone sees these people, these historical figures, as perfect people, but in actuality, they aren't. This play tells the important story of Catherine the Great as Sophie, a German noble, way before her rule in Russia. And that's important. To see someone you look up to like this, in their adolescence, still trying to find their way, opens up doors for you. It tells you that it's okay to not be perfect.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>     Even though I am just a high school girl, there are things I can do to change things, and this is a step towards that, so please, donate money to my cause. <i>Catherine </i>can change people's lives, and it has already changed my own. Though it is risky, and we could end up under budget, I have faith within the people who are scrolling through my campaign, so my job is to promote this campaign until the end. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>     Please don't forget that you can share this campaign! Even if you may not be able to donate any money, there are other people who are willing, so spread the word. I thank you for your time, and I hope to reach our goal.</p>

Soon after that first song (which is the final song in the opera) more material began to present itself with a cohesive narrative about Paolo “Cruze” and Cassandra, two lovers on intersecting developmental trajectories.

Those performances caught the attention of Dennis St. Pierre, whose decades of experience in musical theater and production qualified him to help re-work the concert version of the show into a piece fully-developed for musical theater.  Now with 28 original songs and a cast and crew of professionals from New York, One Way Trip to Mars premieres August 24 – 27 at the historic Waterville Opera House in Maine.  </p><p>Combined with the show we are planning an Art &amp; Science Fair in which local students will explore through the arts the many areas of science involved in space exploration and the future human settlement of Mars.

<h3><strong>Who is  The New Renaissance Theatre Company, and what is The Unrehearsed Shakespeare Project?</strong></h3>
<p>The New Renaissance Theatre Company is a 501(c)(3) non-profit whose mission is to illuminate the joy and passion captured in the best of live theatre by connecting the classic to the contemporary through ensemble-based development and performance.</p>
<p>It is our goal to create an artistic home for an ensemble of actors and theatre craftsmen. It all begins with The Unrehearsed Shakespeare Project.</p>
<p>USP is dedicated to performing the works of William Shakespeare using the unrehearsed cue script technique in order to expose our community to unique productions that bring the audience and performers together in a way that only theatre can. The unrehearsed cue script technique is based upon the working conditions of Shakespeare's own company, our research and our experience in performing and producing plays using this historically informed practice.</p>

<p>We are raising this $1000 to buy 2 single-handled aluminum broadsword from Rogue Steel. These are high-quality, durable weapons that we will use in this summer's <i>The Tragedie of Macbeth</i>. And Fortunately, as a theatre that performs a lot of classical theatre, these swords will get a lot of work in the future! Money raised above the cost of these swords will go towards buying daggers and supplies for storage and upkeep of our budding armory.

The New Renaissance Theatre Company is a 501(c)(3) non-profit whose mission is to illuminate the joy and passion captured in the best of live theatre by connecting the classic to the contemporary through ensemble-based development and performance.
It is our goal to create an artistic home for an ensemble of actors and theatre craftsmen. It all begins with The Unrehearsed Shakespeare Project.
USP is dedicated to performing the works of William Shakespeare using the unrehearsed cue script technique in order to expose our community to unique productions that bring the audience and performers together in a way that only theatre can. The unrehearsed cue script technique is based upon the working conditions of Shakespeare's own company, our research and our experience in performing and producing plays using this historically informed practice.

<ul>
<li>A passionate Director and an inspirational Playwright from opposite sides of the nation collaborate together to bring a heartfelt, important piece of theater to NYC dealing with mental illness and the hyper sexuality to the NYC Theater Festival Scene.</li>
<li><p> Our one-act play is underway, rehearsing with an incredible cast that includes the ever delightful and talented Rew Starr. This show tackles issues prominent in our day and age. With a sensitivity and sensibility to the nature of the themes presented, we have protagonist, Davi (a mashup of Dymphna, the patron saint of mental illness, and King David, if he had a twin sister). She is an artist/ musician dealing with manic depression. in the height of one of her episodes, she faces being evicted, her family life crumbling, and escaping through several Craigslist conquests. Our imagery while tackling this rehearsal process is that she is on a lifeboat and as she grips tighter to the rope securing her to the ship, she feels the harsh waves crash against drifting her further as she sees the rope unraveling. Stories like this are not often told; we feel it is time that they are.</p></li>
<li>We seek your assistance in mounting this production, as the ability to make meaningful productions like ""Maximalista"" doesn't come cheap, and we cannot do it alone. your funds helps us to do a multitude of things:</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>As a Director, I have had the honor to direct 4 new works including this one; all of the shows I have directed have received strong reviews. I always strive to find the comedy in drama and the drama in comedy. I believe life is a constant tug and pull, and I believe theater is a reflection of that. </li>
<li>As a playwright, Ash Sanborn has a strong eye for issues in our present day that although are not in the public eye need to be. Her plays focus on the artist, mental health, addiction, and poverty. It was an honor to act in her first show in NYC and now to collaborate with her as the Director on ""Maximalista.""  #mentalhealthplay. </li>
<li>As Artist, both Ash and I believe that theater can be one of the fastest ways to the heart. Money donated to this  production has value in not only the monetary sense, but also in your belief in us, our cast, and the ability to make a difference. The chance to bring these issues to the forefront and through theatre, that and the impact we know this can have, is priceless.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>We understand that the issues we address are not ones people like discussing. Both the subjects are taboo,but neither lacks importance and needs to be discussed. There is a risk in being insensitive when discussing the fragility of the subjects, but have take the steps to ensure that all things in this show are handled through an artistic sensibility.</li>
<li>We know the risk of producing a show. It is very costly. We will be keeping a strong social media presence, and between that and this campaign, we are committed to make this show happen. We would like to thank The Artist Co-op for being one of the first to support us in a huge way and donating a portion of our needed time in the studio to rehearse to this project. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute a large amount even $5 makes a difference. As artists ourselves, we do understand that even that can be a lot at times, but there are other ways to help and support us:</p>
<ul>
<li>The largest way is to spread word about our campaign. </li>
<li>be sure to take a look at the indiegogo share tools</li>
<li>donations of services are also more than appreciated, ie. taping the production. holding interview, write ups in papers, the possibility are endless.</li>

<h3>Sacrament- About the Show</h3>
<p><i>You know when you tell yourself a particular story about who you are and how you got where you are and where you’re going and then something happens and you have to tell yourself a different story to make sense of yourself to yourself?</i></p>
<p>A little girl in a first communion dress cossetted by family in Catholic Ireland dreams of the next time she will wear a white dress to Mass. But then she grows up. And as her music taste evolves, so does her relationship with God (if there is one), love (but sure what does that even mean?), and sex (but shhh don’t tell her Granny). One day, sexuality suddenly seems to threaten her relationships with her faith, her family and the future she has always imagined for herself. Sacrament is a play which examines how a new generation of Irish young people relate to their country's religious heritage and whether it is possible to reconcile religion with an empowered sense of sexuality.</p>
<p>Sacrament has been commissioned by Theatre Upstairs, Dublin to undertake a run in November of 2017</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Important to know : thanks to Indiegogo we receive all the funds raised here even if we don't make the target - but we know we will because of amazing supporters!</i></p>
<h3>TO EDINBURGH!</h3>
<p>Company of Rogues plan to stage the international premiere of <i>Morgan Stern </i>at the 70th Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2017.</p>
<p>The fringe festival will be an important step in the establishment of an emerging Australian theatre company and its creative team, as well as developing support for our future ambition to tour the production in Australia and beyond in 2018-2019.</p>
<h3>THE PLAY</h3>
<p>Morgan Stern is the latest work from Sydney-based AWGIE-award-winning playwright Gina Schein - an enthralling &amp; complex monologue performed by Graeme Rhodes and directed by Goldele Rayment.</p>
<p>""<i>A troubling, beautiful, uplifting ninety minutes that will leave you breathless</i>"" Lisa Thatcher.</p>
<p>Part ghost, part protector, and known only as The Gent. He has been assigned to the other side of the planet to minister to Morgan, a young Sydneysider living with schizophrenia in 1974. Shifting between centuries and across hemispheres, Morgan Stern is an enthralling one-man play exploring family, schizophrenia and the search for internal peace, set in a little-known corner of the universe: the human brain.</p>
<p>Informed by the experience of her own brother’s life, AWGIE award-winner Gina Schien has crafted a heart-warming new monologue that leaves audiences genuinely moved.</p>
<p><strong>The project aims to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Stage Morgan Stern at the 70th Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August 2017</li>
<li>Secure UK touring opportunities for Morgan Stern for 2018/19</li>
<li>Provide international exposure for the production &amp; company through extensive participation in Ed.Fringe industry events.</li>
<li>Support the professional development of our artists and arts managers.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p><strong>So far we have covered 71% of our expenses!</strong></p>
<p>This project isn't about profit - it's about taking Australian artists and their work to international stages. So, funds will be used to cover upfront costs including accommodation, food and transport. This funding will also cover the gap between our ticket sales and other income so we can break even.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495083152/jwalpxc4a48bodcb3dcj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><i><strong>Social Impact</strong></i></p>
<ul>
<li>Morgan Stern has the power to help audiences develop a deeper understanding and compassion for those in our communities struggling to live with chronic mental illness.</li>
<li>Our presence in Edinburgh will contribute to the diversity of Australian work presented there by introducing a unique solo-theatre production that confidently deals with lived disability experiences, specifically mental health, from a contemporary Australian perspective.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><i>Australian Theatre </i></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We want to be a part of placing Australian arts at the centre of the world's largest fringe/performing arts festival, now in its 70th year. At Edinburgh Fringe in 2015, 94 Australian productions of various scale were presented with multiple award nominations attracting ongoing attention to Australian festival participants. With an excellent venue secured and the right support both at home and in the UK, Company of Rogues is ready to do just that!</li>
<li>Morgan Stern will contribute to the collective cultural expression of Australian arts at the Edinburgh Fringe (and beyond should EU and UK touring ambitions be realised as a result of the festival season)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Theatre is expensive, an overseas tour even more so!!</li>
<li>Cash flow for upfront costs -  we can't access our box office takings until after our season concludes</li>
<li>Our expenses may exceed our current income - we have 2 funding applications we are yet to hear the result of which means we must proceed as if we do not get them. IF we meet our target we will break even.</li>
</ul>
<h3>REWARDS</h3>
<p>Please note ticket rewards are only available on July 1st &amp; 2nd. Donations made between 3rd and 7th July will be offered an alternative reward.</p>
<p><strong>FOR ARTS SAKE</strong></p>
<p>We have three original works from local artist Martin Yusuf. Starting at a donation of just $60, you can be rewarded with real art, for art's sake!</p>

Company of Rogues plan to stage the international premiere of Morgan Stern at the 70th Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2017.
The fringe festival will be an important step in the establishment of an emerging Australian theatre company and its creative team, as well as developing support for our future ambition to tour the production in Australia and beyond in 2018-2019.
THE PLAY
Morgan Stern is the latest work from Sydney-based AWGIE-award-winning playwright Gina Schein - an enthralling & complex monologue performed by Graeme Rhodes and directed by Goldele Rayment.
""A troubling, beautiful, uplifting ninety minutes that will leave you breathless"" Lisa Thatcher.
Part ghost, part protector, and known only as The Gent. He has been assigned to the other side of the planet to minister to Morgan, a young Sydneysider living with schizophrenia in 1974. Shifting between centuries and across hemispheres, Morgan Stern is an enthralling one-man play exploring family, schizophrenia and the search for internal peace, set in a little-known corner of the universe: the human brain.
Informed by the experience of her own brother’s life, AWGIE award-winner Gina Schien has crafted a heart-warming new monologue that leaves audiences genuinely moved.
The project aims to:

Stage Morgan Stern at the 70th Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August 2017
Secure UK touring opportunities for Morgan Stern for 2018/19
Provide international exposure for the production & company through extensive participation in Ed.Fringe industry events.
Support the professional development of our artists and arts managers.


What We Need
So far we have covered 71% of our expenses!
This project isn't about profit - it's about taking Australian artists and their work to international stages. So, funds will be used to cover upfront costs including accommodation, food and transport. This funding will also cover the gap between our ticket sales and other income so we can break even.


The Impact
Social Impact

Morgan Stern has the power to help audiences develop a deeper understanding and compassion for those in our communities struggling to live with chronic mental illness.
Our presence in Edinburgh will contribute to the diversity of Australian work presented there by introducing a unique solo-theatre production that confidently deals with lived disability experiences, specifically mental health, from a contemporary Australian perspective.

Australian Theatre 

We want to be a part of placing Australian arts at the centre of the world's largest fringe/performing arts festival, now in its 70th year. At Edinburgh Fringe in 2015, 94 Australian productions of various scale were presented with multiple award nominations attracting ongoing attention to Australian festival participants. With an excellent venue secured and the right support both at home and in the UK, Company of Rogues is ready to do just that!
Morgan Stern will contribute to the collective cultural expression of Australian arts at the Edinburgh Fringe (and beyond should EU and UK touring ambitions be realised as a result of the festival season)


Risks & Challenges

Theatre is expensive, an overseas tour even more so!!
Cash flow for upfront costs -  we can't access our box office takings until after our season concludes
Our expenses may exceed our current income - we have 2 funding applications we are yet to hear the result of which means we must proceed as if we do not get them. IF we meet our target we will break even.

REWARDS
Please note ticket rewards are only available on July 1st & 2nd. Donations made between 3rd and 7th July will be offered an alternative reward.
FOR ARTS SAKE
We have three original works from local artist Martin Yusuf. Starting at a donation of just $60, you can be rewarded with real art, for art's sake!
1. For Arts Sake 1 - Purple Flowers

2. For Arts Sake 2 - Tree of Life 2

3. For Arts Sake 3 - Tree of Life 1

<h3>70 Scenes of Halloween</h3>
<p>The turbulent tale abandons linear narrative in favor of 70 brief scenes played out of order, resulting in a wild, dreamlike ride that blends realism with psychological surprise and humor. Partners become wolves and phantoms in this domestic drama about a marriage dying of familiarity. Their haunted home offers a weirdly comical and thought-provoking glimpse into the nature of relationships.</p>
<p>Theatre L'Acadie is excited to produce it's first production as a newly established Chicago theatre company! Revealing the truths of the human condition, <i>70 Scenes of Halloween</i> is insightful, imaginative, and untraditional. Our show will run from October 2, 2019 - October 13, 2019, reaching a wide range of audiences. Theatre L'Acadie aspires to provide the Chicago community with the unique opportunity to engage in something new and unknown. We are three women setting out to make our dreams a reality, and for that, we need your help!</p>
<p>Emily, Kaitlin, and Brandii (co-founder's of Theatre L'Acadie) would like to dedicate this show in remembrance of our dear friend, Andrew Lee Vincent, the original ""Jeff"". </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What is Theatre L'Acadie?</h3>
<p>Theatré L’Acadie represents the veritable melangé of talent that Louisiana holds. Reigning from various regions in Acadiana, Emily, Brandii, and Kaitlin represent the Cajun ideal of bringing people together through food, culture, and of course, art! </p>
<p>Showcasing a unique and evocative visual artist every season, the group enjoys bringing together music, dance, and visual arts to leave people with a taste for something new. The group focuses on works lesser known by popular artists, and sometimes even the rejected works of the theater world. For our first production, <i>70 Scenes of Halloween</i>, we hope to embody our mission: </p>
<p>""How do you get people to talk about the ugly, the boring, the ordinary? our mission is to provoke thought, promote discussion, and influence change, through the power of live theatre.""</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where does the money go?</h3>
<p>As a new theatre company, our goal is to establish a strong relationship and positive reputation within the Chicago theatre community. If this campaign is successful, we will be able to do so through our production of <i>70 Scenes of Halloween</i>.</p>
<p>Below you can see a detailed breakdown of our full production cost: </p>

</div><div>
<p>As you can see from the chart above, our largest expense is paying the necessary fees associated with renting our rehearsal and performance space. After these costs, the majority of the money we raise will go directly to paying our artists, technicians, and designers. We firmly believe that this is what a theatrical budget should look like. Due to the countless amount of hours it takes to mount a full length professional production, paying our collaborators the amount they deserve is of the utmost importance!</p>
<p>A fully funded Indiegogo campaign will ensure that we are able to produce a show of high caliber and pay our artists, technicians, and designers the amount they deserve. Your contributions to <i>70 Scenes of Halloween</i> will go beyond our first show; they will help Theatre L'Acadie continuously create unique performance art for years to come!</p>

<h3>What? </h3>
<p><i>The Actor's Nightmare</i> is a striking 90-minute journey in which <u>Tony award-winning playwright </u><strong>Christopher Durang</strong> explores the eccentric, toxic, hilarious, and lonely world of New York Theatre and the entertainment industry. Over the course of the piece, we meet actors, directors, writers, stage managers, stand-up comedians, and executive producers. We even meet an accountant, who really doesn't want to be here. <i>The Actor's Nightmare </i>is at once a celebration of show business and a touching reflection on what it means to be an artist. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1555155353/pnexfxjdsnshyfebypti.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>From Tennessee Williams to Euripides, tossing in a bit of Beckett, no renowned playwright is safe. Classic plays are warped and distorted - the outcome is both shocking and hilarious. We follow our company of 5 through the foibles and faux pas that feed entertainment nightmares. </p>
<p>Our production features several <u>UK PREMIERES</u> and is in itself a <u>WORLD PREMIERE</u> : It is the first time that these plays have been brought together in this unique and thrilling way.</p>
<p>Pieces included are: <i><strong>Mrs Sorken;</strong></i> <i><strong>Desire, Desire, Desire;</strong></i>  <i><strong>The Actor's Nightmare;</strong></i> <i><strong>Business Lunch at the Russian Tea Room;</strong></i> <strong style=""font-style: italic;"">Medea</strong><i><strong>;</strong></i> and<i><strong>Woman Stand-Up. </strong></i></p>
<p><u>These works will seamlessly come together as a striking, full-length play</u>.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are ""Social Speakers"", a theater group formed by theater students. Our goal is to support those in need by collecting funds by exhibiting Plays in local theaters. </p>
<p>Our first play would be, "" Rupa &amp; Krishna"", a play that depicts the story of Rupa and krishna. <br/>Krishna Oli, A civil engineer, lost his two hands and a feet in a electric shock accident.<br/>His wife, Rupa,  has been taking care of him since the day and she is collecting funds to install artificial hands and feet so that Krishna can get back to his regular work.</p>
<p>We, ""Social Speakers"", aim to raise funds through this play and also spread message that love and support can help a disabled keep faith in themselves and get back to their regular life and that disability is temporary and providing will power is the first key to curing all disabilities. </p>
<p>This play would cost us around USD 2,000 , for expenses on headings like theater hiring cost, actors, set designs, promotional activities and ticket prints. <br/>The USD 2,000 investment will yield more than USD 10,000 and also those who visit to watch the play will get to know them closer and also donate any amount they wish through the donation box placed at the venue.</p>
