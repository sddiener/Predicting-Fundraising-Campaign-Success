<p>In the film, it is described how wave energy does not currently contribute to the world power supply. There are several ongoing attempts but none of them have been successful. The Crestwing Concept is a completely new way of approaching wave energy research. It challenges the established methods, and brings to light some of the uncharted territory of wave energy extraction.</p>
<p>Crestwing’s core concept is to utilize the atmospheric pressure. The atmospheric pressure is created by the weight of all the air above us, and it creates a pressure of 10 ton per m² on the surface of the earth. These 10 tons act as a pull, if a vacuum is created. When Crestwing floats on the sea, there is no air between the bottom of Crestwing and the sea. When the wave starts falling, it pulls Crestwing with it, as if they were glued together. This process is comparable to the old wind turbines which used to be pushed by the wind. The new aerodynamic wind turbines use low pressure on the backside of the wing, just like an airplanewing. This method is far more effective than the old wind turbines. Wave energy also in general works through a push from the wave while Crestwing works by a vacuum under the hull. Crestwing's principle is hydrodynamic, which is due to the atmospheric pressure and is far more efficient than the plants that are solely due to the push from the wave, that is, Archimedes principle</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ZQrgJ8tvoE?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""100%""></iframe></div></div>
<p><i>A short film descriping how <a href=""http://crestwing.dk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Crestwing</a> works, and showing how it looks.</i></p>
<p>This is a complete revolution of the established method of wave energy extraction. We can not wait to show Crestwing´s effectivity and how  it works, and  bring it in as a co-player in the human effort to switch to fossil-free energy supply. Although Crestwing has been tested in many smaller models, Tordenskiold, as this prototype is named, is the first one close to full scale.</p>
<p>Tordenskiold has multiple purposes. The first one is to show that the anchorage and mechanical parts of Crestwing can survive the rough seas. The second purpose is to show the effectivity of Crestwing’s energy conversion.</p>
<p>A grid connection costs around 540.000 EURO, which is currently too high a cost for Crestwing to pay. This means Tordenskiold will not be connected to the power grid in the first phase, but the production will instead be measured, and the produced electricity will be dumped.</p>
<p>We have an extended data program where we can read, both on Crestwing and on the internet, the electrical production, forces in the vital parts, wave states etc. There is an alarm if Crestwing is not in the appointed position or if anything should happen to it. To show that Crestwing can survive the sea and have a high production of energy, it is vital to get as much data as possible.</p>
<p>Before the death of Henning, he was developing most of Tordenskiold, and he was almost done. But some final design decisions and calculation were still needed. Erik Bøgh, a senior maritime engineer, is indispensable in this final work. In the workshop Poul Bjørnager, with his skills and commitment, is unique.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Technical specifications</h3>
<p>Experiments have shown that Crestwing’s yearly energy production in the Danish Seas is around 1 million kWh, which is slightly less than the production from the Danish wind turbines. These data are from the tests, in the future there will be lots of work with development and optimizing of the power take of system. </p>
<p>When the size of a wave is doubled, the energy in the wave is not merely doubled, but instead multiplied by a factor of 11. This means that Crestwing constructions made for seas with twice as large waves as the Danish waves, can reach an energy production of 11 million kWh. This is only achieved by very few wind turbines.</p>
<p>It is well known that the energy production from wave energy is much more stable than wind and solar energy. Where wind energy some years produce much less than predicted, and other years much more, wave energy has a more stable and predictable energy production.</p>
<p>The hull of Crestwing has been designed as a ship h­­ull. This makes it easy for any local shipyard to make the hull, so it does not have to be transported from inland. Because Crestwing is unreliant on the weight of the hull, one can always choose the cheapest material for the production.</p>
<p>When wind turbines and wave energy converters are put at sea, they are anchored by casting a concrete construction on the bottom of the ocean, which is expensive. Crestwing’s anchorage is instead screwed into the ocean floor. This makes the launch of Crestwing cheap. The anchorage is also easy to release, so Crestwing can be dragged into a shipyard for repairs.</p>
<p>If a mechanical error should arise, it is not as big a problem for Crestwing as with many other constructions. This is because Crestwing contains multiple generators, so if one fails, the energy production can continue, until repairs can be made. Because of the design of Crestwing, a repairman can easily dock on to Crestwing and enter it.</p>

<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ml4oZUlIufA?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""100%""></iframe></div><i>En kort film, der fortæller om Crestwings historie og mål</i>
</div>
<div> </div>
<p>Som fortalt I filmen er der ikke noget bølgeenergi i verden som bidrager til elproduktionen. Der er forskellige forsøg, men der har endnu ikke været et gennembrud. Crestwingkonceptet er banebrydende ny tankegang inden for bølgeenergiforskningen og gør op med tidligere tiders fastlåste tankegang om, hvordan man kan udvinde energi fra bølger.</p>
<p>Den grundliggende idé bag Crestwing er at udnytte atmosfæretrykket, som giver en potentiel kraft på 10 ton per m². De 10 ton pr m² opfattes og måles som et sug eller et undertryk. Da der ikke kommer luft mellem anlægget og havoverfladen, ligger anlægget som limet til havoverfladen. Man kan sammenligne det med vindmøllerne. Mens de gamle kornmøller blev skubbet af vinden, virker de nye møller ved, at der skabes et undertryk på bagsiden af vingen. De trebladede vindmøller er aerodynamiske som en flyvinge og langt mere effektive end de gamle møllevinger. Bølgeenergi i almindelighed virker gennem et skub fra bølgen, mens Crestwing virker  ved et undertryk under anlægget. Crestwings princip er hydrodynamisk, og er langt mere effektiv end de anlæg, som udelukkende beror på skubbet fra bølgen, altså Arkimedes princip.</p>
<p> </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/uCGAcuSxIXA?rel=0&amp;showinfo=0"" width=""100%""></iframe></div></div>
<p><i>En kort teknisk film, som viser anlægget, og forklarer hvordan det virker</i></p>
<p>Crestwings koncept er en revolutionær tankegang, som gør op med den etablerede metode for bølgeenergi produktion. Derfor glæder vi os til at vise at Crestwing er det anlæg, som har evnen til at bringe bølgeenergi ind som en medspiller i menneskets bestræbelse på at komme over på en fossilfri energiforsyning.</p>
<p>Selvom anlægget er testet i mange mindre modeller er ""Tordenskiold"" som anlægget hedder den første i tæt på fuldskala.</p>
<p>Først og fremmest skal den vise, at den kan klare miljøet til søs og at forankring og hængsler holder. Derefter, at den er effektiv til at optage energi fra bølgerne og effektiv til at omdanne den optaget energi til El. Vi forventer naturligvis stadig meget udviklingsarbejde fremover.</p>
<p>Tordenskiold vil ikke blive tilsluttet elnettet i første omgang, Et kabel til el-tilslutning koster omkring 5.000.000 DDK produktionen vil blive aflæst og elproduktionen vil blive tilført en dump load.</p>
<p>Vi har et udvidet måleprogram, hvor vi kan aflæse data, både på anlægget og på land hvor meget el den producerer, kræfter i vitale dele, bølgetilstande osv. og alarm, hvis anlægget ikke er i position eller hvis der sker andet. Det er vitalt at vi får så meget data som muligt.</p>
<p>Før Henning døde var der arbejdet med alle områder af udviklingen af anlægget, men der manglede stadig de sidste beslutninger vedrørende design og beregninger på forskellige områder. Her er Erik Bøgh, som er senior maritim ingeniør, uundværlig.<br/>I værkstedet er Poul Bjørnager en enestående kapacitet med sin viden, faglige færdigheder og engagement.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Lidt tekniske detaljer</h3>
<p>Crestwings årlige energiproduktion i dansk farvand, er målt til at være omkring 1 million kWh, hvilket er lidt under de danske vindmøllers produktion i et godt år, og det samme som i dårlige år. Disse produktionstal er fra de udførte testresultater, der vil fremover være masser af arbejde med videreudvikling og optimering af power take off systemet. </p>
<p>Bølgeenergi har den egenskab, at ved en fordobling af bølgernes størrelse, vil der være 11 gange mere energi til rådighed. Dette betyder, at i farvande med dobbelt så store bølger end de danske, vil anlægget kunne producere op imod 11 millioner kWh, hvilket kun få møller kan i dag.</p>
<p> Det er alment anerkendt, at strømproduktionen fra bølgeenergi er meget mere stabil end vind og solenergi. Dette gør, at hvor vindenergi nogen år producere væsentlig mindre end forventet, og andre år producere væsentlig mere end forventet, vil bølgeenergi have en stabil forudsigelig produktion.</p>
<p>Crestwings skrog er designet som et skib. Det gør, at ethvert lokalt skibsværft vil kunne producere skroget, og det derfor ikke skal fragtes langt for at blive sat i vandet. Derudover er vægten af anlægget uden betydning, så byggematerialet kan altid ændres, til det som er billigst på byggetidspunktet.</p>
<p>I modsætning til mange andre havanlæg, både vindmøller og andre bølgeenergianlæg, er Crestwings forankringssystem ikke støbt på bunden af havet, men derimod skruet ned i havbunden. Dette gør udsætningen meget billigere. Forankringen er også simpel at frakoble anlægget, så den nemt kan slæbes til et skibsværft til reparationer.</p>
<p>Inde i Crestwing er der mange generatorer, i stedet for blot én. Dette gør, at hvis der sker en fejl i en generator, vil anlægget stadig producere strøm, indtil en reparatør kan komme til anlægget. På grund af anlæggets design, er det nemt at lægge til, og komme ind i anlægget, som har rigeligt med plads til at gå rundt i og reparer anlægget.</p>

  Crestwing goes new waterways
In the film, it is described how wave energy does not currently contribute to the world power supply. There are several ongoing attempts but none of them have been successful. The Crestwing Concept is a completely new way of approaching wave energy research. It challenges the established methods, and brings to light some of the uncharted territory of wave energy extraction.
Crestwing’s core concept is to utilize the atmospheric pressure. The atmospheric pressure is created by the weight of all the air above us, and it creates a pressure of 10 ton per m² on the surface of the earth. These 10 tons act as a pull, if a vacuum is created. When Crestwing floats on the sea, there is no air between the bottom of Crestwing and the sea. When the wave starts falling, it pulls Crestwing with it, as if they were glued together. This process is comparable to the old wind turbines which used to be pushed by the wind. The new aerodynamic wind turbines use low pressure on the backside of the wing, just like an airplanewing. This method is far more effective than the old wind turbines. Wave energy also in general works through a push from the wave while Crestwing works by a vacuum under the hull. Crestwing's principle is hydrodynamic, which is due to the atmospheric pressure and is far more efficient than the plants that are solely due to the push from the wave, that is, Archimedes principle

A short film descriping how Crestwing works, and showing how it looks.
This is a complete revolution of the established method of wave energy extraction. We can not wait to show Crestwing´s effectivity and how  it works, and  bring it in as a co-player in the human effort to switch to fossil-free energy supply. Although Crestwing has been tested in many smaller models, Tordenskiold, as this prototype is named, is the first one close to full scale.
Tordenskiold has multiple purposes. The first one is to show that the anchorage and mechanical parts of Crestwing can survive the rough seas. The second purpose is to show the effectivity of Crestwing’s energy conversion.
A grid connection costs around 540.000 EURO, which is currently too high a cost for Crestwing to pay. This means Tordenskiold will not be connected to the power grid in the first phase, but the production will instead be measured, and the produced electricity will be dumped.
We have an extended data program where we can read, both on Crestwing and on the internet, the electrical production, forces in the vital parts, wave states etc. There is an alarm if Crestwing is not in the appointed position or if anything should happen to it. To show that Crestwing can survive the sea and have a high production of energy, it is vital to get as much data as possible.
Before the death of Henning, he was developing most of Tordenskiold, and he was almost done. But some final design decisions and calculation were still needed. Erik Bøgh, a senior maritime engineer, is indispensable in this final work. In the workshop Poul Bjørnager, with his skills and commitment, is unique.  
 
Technical specifications
Experiments have shown that Crestwing’s yearly energy production in the Danish Seas is around 1 million kWh, which is slightly less than the production from the Danish wind turbines. These data are from the tests, in the future there will be lots of work with development and optimizing of the power take of system. 
When the size of a wave is doubled, the energy in the wave is not merely doubled, but instead multiplied by a factor of 11. This means that Crestwing constructions made for seas with twice as large waves as the Danish waves, can reach an energy production of 11 million kWh. This is only achieved by very few wind turbines.
It is well known that the energy production from wave energy is much more stable than wind and solar energy. Where wind energy some years produce much less than predicted, and other years much more, wave energy has a more stable and predictable energy production.
The hull of Crestwing has been designed as a ship h­­ull. This makes it easy for any local shipyard to make the hull, so it does not have to be transported from inland. Because Crestwing is unreliant on the weight of the hull, one can always choose the cheapest material for the production.
When wind turbines and wave energy converters are put at sea, they are anchored by casting a concrete construction on the bottom of the ocean, which is expensive. Crestwing’s anchorage is instead screwed into the ocean floor. This makes the launch of Crestwing cheap. The anchorage is also easy to release, so Crestwing can be dragged into a shipyard for repairs.
If a mechanical error should arise, it is not as big a problem for Crestwing as with many other constructions. This is because Crestwing contains multiple generators, so if one fails, the energy production can continue, until repairs can be made. Because of the design of Crestwing, a repairman can easily dock on to Crestwing and enter it.
 
We are working in three steps.

 Inventor and founder of CrestwingHenning Pilgaard19/6-1944 - 08/09-2016In 1972 Henning Pilgaard finished his education as mechanical engineer and hereafter worked at Odense Steel Shipyard Lindø. Already in his time of study he was interested in renewable energy and after the energy crisis in 1973 he began, in his spare time, to work with a grassroots organization regarding conversion from fossil fuels to renewable energy in the municipality of Kerteminde.Since 1982 Henning  worked full time promoting the transition to renewable energy, and among other things launched and finished many complex renewable energy projects, including two of the first wind turbine farms in Denmark, the regional energy project ""Bornholm a green island"", biogas plants, gas-engines based on CHP plants, and finally he has been developing and realizing the WEC Crestwing. Co founderRuth BloomRuth has been committed to working to preserve the environment and promote renewable energy since she in the beginning of 1980, became aware of the giant consumption of resources. She has the educations of blacksmith, teacher, 3D constructer and book keeper. She has participated in all parts of the process regarding the realization of Crestwing. Ruth and Henning were married for 28 years and they worked side by side with Crestwing and many other environmental projects and now she has taken over the management of Crestwing after his death. It is important for her and the world to complete their life work. Chairman of the BoardPeter Høstgaard-JensenPeter has been the Director of Elsam which is the Danish electrical company in Copenhagen and is and has been in countless boards regarding renewable energy.
A short documentary from 2011, telling the story of Crestwing.

  Crestwing går nye bølgeveje

En kort film, der fortæller om Crestwings historie og mål

 
Som fortalt I filmen er der ikke noget bølgeenergi i verden som bidrager til elproduktionen. Der er forskellige forsøg, men der har endnu ikke været et gennembrud. Crestwingkonceptet er banebrydende ny tankegang inden for bølgeenergiforskningen og gør op med tidligere tiders fastlåste tankegang om, hvordan man kan udvinde energi fra bølger.
Den grundliggende idé bag Crestwing er at udnytte atmosfæretrykket, som giver en potentiel kraft på 10 ton per m². De 10 ton pr m² opfattes og måles som et sug eller et undertryk. Da der ikke kommer luft mellem anlægget og havoverfladen, ligger anlægget som limet til havoverfladen. Man kan sammenligne det med vindmøllerne. Mens de gamle kornmøller blev skubbet af vinden, virker de nye møller ved, at der skabes et undertryk på bagsiden af vingen. De trebladede vindmøller er aerodynamiske som en flyvinge og langt mere effektive end de gamle møllevinger. Bølgeenergi i almindelighed virker gennem et skub fra bølgen, mens Crestwing virker  ved et undertryk under anlægget. Crestwings princip er hydrodynamisk, og er langt mere effektiv end de anlæg, som udelukkende beror på skubbet fra bølgen, altså Arkimedes princip.
 

En kort teknisk film, som viser anlægget, og forklarer hvordan det virker
Crestwings koncept er en revolutionær tankegang, som gør op med den etablerede metode for bølgeenergi produktion. Derfor glæder vi os til at vise at Crestwing er det anlæg, som har evnen til at bringe bølgeenergi ind som en medspiller i menneskets bestræbelse på at komme over på en fossilfri energiforsyning.
Selvom anlægget er testet i mange mindre modeller er ""Tordenskiold"" som anlægget hedder den første i tæt på fuldskala.
Først og fremmest skal den vise, at den kan klare miljøet til søs og at forankring og hængsler holder. Derefter, at den er effektiv til at optage energi fra bølgerne og effektiv til at omdanne den optaget energi til El. Vi forventer naturligvis stadig meget udviklingsarbejde fremover.
Tordenskiold vil ikke blive tilsluttet elnettet i første omgang, Et kabel til el-tilslutning koster omkring 5.000.000 DDK produktionen vil blive aflæst og elproduktionen vil blive tilført en dump load.
Vi har et udvidet måleprogram, hvor vi kan aflæse data, både på anlægget og på land hvor meget el den producerer, kræfter i vitale dele, bølgetilstande osv. og alarm, hvis anlægget ikke er i position eller hvis der sker andet. Det er vitalt at vi får så meget data som muligt.
Før Henning døde var der arbejdet med alle områder af udviklingen af anlægget, men der manglede stadig de sidste beslutninger vedrørende design og beregninger på forskellige områder. Her er Erik Bøgh, som er senior maritim ingeniør, uundværlig.I værkstedet er Poul Bjørnager en enestående kapacitet med sin viden, faglige færdigheder og engagement.
 
Lidt tekniske detaljer
Crestwings årlige energiproduktion i dansk farvand, er målt til at være omkring 1 million kWh, hvilket er lidt under de danske vindmøllers produktion i et godt år, og det samme som i dårlige år. Disse produktionstal er fra de udførte testresultater, der vil fremover være masser af arbejde med videreudvikling og optimering af power take off systemet. 
Bølgeenergi har den egenskab, at ved en fordobling af bølgernes størrelse, vil der være 11 gange mere energi til rådighed. Dette betyder, at i farvande med dobbelt så store bølger end de danske, vil anlægget kunne producere op imod 11 millioner kWh, hvilket kun få møller kan i dag.
 Det er alment anerkendt, at strømproduktionen fra bølgeenergi er meget mere stabil end vind og solenergi. Dette gør, at hvor vindenergi nogen år producere væsentlig mindre end forventet, og andre år producere væsentlig mere end forventet, vil bølgeenergi have en stabil forudsigelig produktion.
Crestwings skrog er designet som et skib. Det gør, at ethvert lokalt skibsværft vil kunne producere skroget, og det derfor ikke skal fragtes langt for at blive sat i vandet. Derudover er vægten af anlægget uden betydning, så byggematerialet kan altid ændres, til det som er billigst på byggetidspunktet.
I modsætning til mange andre havanlæg, både vindmøller og andre bølgeenergianlæg, er Crestwings forankringssystem ikke støbt på bunden af havet, men derimod skruet ned i havbunden. Dette gør udsætningen meget billigere. Forankringen er også simpel at frakoble anlægget, så den nemt kan slæbes til et skibsværft til reparationer.
Inde i Crestwing er der mange generatorer, i stedet for blot én. Dette gør, at hvis der sker en fejl i en generator, vil anlægget stadig producere strøm, indtil en reparatør kan komme til anlægget. På grund af anlæggets design, er det nemt at lægge til, og komme ind i anlægget, som har rigeligt med plads til at gå rundt i og reparer anlægget.
Vi arbejder i tre trin:

Our team believes that design must expertly combine form as well as function. It weighs only 2.1kg but provides 50,000mAh capacity with 7 ports. It’s the perfect power-ready solution for a one or two days outdoor trip, such as an afternoon picnic, weekend camping, fishing, trekking or as an emergency standby power source at home.

 
""We don't typically follow Indiegogo projects, but the iMuto S5 Portable Solar Power Station follows on the heels of some existing products that show serious promise. The iMuto S5 claims 50Ah and 180Wh of power geared primarily for mobile devices. It even has an optional solar charging system. ""                                                                                                                   ——Clint DeBoer, Protool Reviews
While there are many USB portable power packs available, many lack the versatility or the charge capacity to handle serving the power and charge needs for multiple devices and for extended periods of time. The iMuto S5 Portable Solar Power Station which just launched on Indiegogo looks like a possible solution and a game changer for me.
                                                                                                                 ——Julian Perry, The Gadgeteer
 

iMuto S5 has a battery capacity of 50,000mAh/180W and a total output of 260W. It will be the best companion for your outdoor life.

 

Unlike other power supplies with USB ports only, iMuto S5 has added capacity for home use together with mobile device power for family camping trips, traveling, or extreme expeditions. In addition, the iMuto S5 makes a reliable backup power supply for disasters and emergency situations. It is powerful enough to keep your cooler, lights, life-saving medical devices or other essential gear running during power outages.



No matter where you go, you can take iMuto S5 with you. Charging and recharging are simple. Collect and store power using the wall charger, a car, or directly from the sun!

Fast Re-charge
You can safely recharge iMuto S5 in 6 hours using wall charger, 9 hours using car charger (DC, 12V, 5A), or 15 hours using solar panels (DC, 18V 3A).
*Data under standard testing conditions STD：1000W/m², AM 1.5, 25 °C（38000-40000LUX).

iSolar PanelsiMuto S5 sets you free from the grid with anytime solar charging. Recharge iMuto and power up your devices anywhere using the free, limitless, and environmentally-friendly power of the sun. Long camping trips, off-grid areas and remote travel with reliable power are now possible. For ease of use, iMuto features a clear, easy to read LED display. In this way, you can estimate charging and runtimes at a glance. A real-time input and output calculator keeps you informed with the charging status at all times.Be prepared for an emergency with iMuto ready. In the past two years, iMuto products have helped hundreds of disaster survivals with their power supply.

<p>Keeping bees is such a joyful and rewarding pastime. It gives you the opportunity to observe the interconnectedness of life, to appreciate the changing seasons in a new way, and to play an active role in contributing to the health of your environment. </p>
<p>As you get to know your bees, you’ll discover many fascinating aspects of their behaviour. You’ll start to notice little things like how they communicate with each other, the way they construct honeycomb, and which plants are in flower throughout the year. Plus, of course, there’s also the sweetness of having honey to share with your family and neighbours. </p>

<p style=""text-align: right;""><strong>- Jeff Walker, Texas</strong></p>
<p>As bees tend to focus on filling one individual Flow Frame before moving on to the next, even within a single Flow Hive, the flavour will vary between frames depending on the forage available.</p>
<p>Flow technology allows those single origin flavours to shine through, while eliminating the incidental blending and the oxidation associated with conventional methods.</p>

<h3>FLOW HIVE &amp; BEEKEEPING BASICS:</h3>
<p><strong>What is a Flow Hive?</strong><br/>A Flow Hive is our complete beehive comprising of a brood box and Flow Super (which contains our patented Flow Frames), plus a roof and screened baseboard, inner cover and queen excluder. We may also refer to any beehive with at least one brood box and one or more Flow Supers for honey storage and harvest as a Flow Hive. A honeybee hive is usually made up of two boxes; the brood box where the queen bee lays eggs, and the ‘super’ with honeycomb for the storage of honey. A ‘Flow Super’ is a beehive box using Flow Frames that the bees store honey in.</p>
<p><strong>What are Flow Frames?</strong><br/>“Flow” is the name of our revolutionary invention that allows honey to be harvested directly from the hive without opening the hive and with little disturbance to the bees. The Flow Frames are the honey storage frames for use in the super box that make this possible.</p>
<p><strong>How do the Flow Frames work?</strong><br/>The Flow Frame consists of already partly formed honeycomb cells. The bees complete the comb with their wax, fill the cells with honey and cap the cells as usual. When you turn the Flow Key, the cells split vertically inside the comb forming channels, allowing the honey to flow down to a sealed trough at the base of the frame and out of the hive - a bit like a tap - while the bees are practically undisturbed on the comb surface.<br/>When the honey has finished draining, you turn the Flow Key again in the upper slot, resetting the comb into the original position. The bees then sense the comb is empty, chew the wax capping away, and start to fill it with nectar again.</p>
<p><strong>How </strong><strong>are</strong><strong> 2nd Generation Flow Frames different to the original Flow Frames?</strong><br/>Both our Flow Hive 2 and Flow Hive Classic come with generation 2 Flow Frames.<br/>These contain lots of minor improvements for better functionality, durability and to further minimise any disturbance to the bees during harvest. <br/>These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjustments in the cell depth of the moving comb blade, so the movement that forms channels through the comb happens deeper beneath the bees feet for minimal disturbance, this also allows the bees to draw out their comb further.</li>
<li>A decrease in the cell wall thickness results in a slight increase in the amount of honey that can be stored and harvested from each Flow Frame.</li>
<li>The central spine of the moving parts is now more robust offering more durability.</li>
<li>An increase in the reset and lift pressure from the Flow Key is added for better functionality.</li>
<li>Added radiuses and angles for easier insertion of the Flow Frames when beekeeping.</li>
<li>Some cosmetic rounded edges have been added on the front lower transparent end.</li>
<li>Tighter securing cables hold the frame together more securely.</li>
<li>Upper and lower frame caps now have a handle negating the need for pliers to remove.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How do I stop the bees getting to the honey while it's draining out of the Flow Hive?</strong><br/>Quite often we can drain the honey out without the bees even noticing us at the back of the hive, but sometimes they may be attracted to the honey and you will need to cover the jars, or better still, make a sealed system. This can be achieved by simply making a hole in the lid of a jar for a tube to go into.  If you are using a bucket, you can put many holes through the lid of the bucket or make up a manifold.</p>
<p><strong>Do the bees willingly fill the Flow Frames compared to </strong><strong>conventional</strong><strong> wax foundation?</strong><br/>The speed at which the bees fill the Flow Frames for the first time in comparison to conventional frames will vary greatly from colony to colony. Some bees will start to fill them quickly whilst other can take longer. There are many methods that can be used to encourage a slow colony to get working on the frames, see <a href=""https://www.honeyflow.com/faqs/all/why-arent-my-bees-filling-the-flow-frames/p/194"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our FAQ here</a> for further information. We have found that once the bees have completed the frames for the first time they no longer seem to show  a preference either way and readily start building on, and filling the Flow Frames at the same time as the traditional ones.</p>
<p><strong>How long does it take before I can drain the honey from the Flow Hive?</strong>This depends on the amount of nectar available in your region for the bees and how strong the colony is. Most colonies will need time to establish in the brood box before the Flow Super can be added to the hive, which can take weeks to months depending on the strength of the colony, method of installation, time of year and available forage. Once the super has been added to the hive and there is a good nectar flow available, progress can be pretty fast. We have had Flow Supers that have filled in one week during peak times of the flowering season, however, with a strong colony and good nectar source you can usually expect honey with a month or two.  </p>
<p><strong>How long does it take for the honey to drain out?</strong><br/>Anything from twenty minutes to over two hours depending on the temperature and the viscosity of the honey. It is even OK to leave it draining overnight (if it is secure from nocturnal animals). When you have finished draining the honey remember to return the frames to ‘closed cell’ position so that the bees can seal the broken cells and recommence filling them with more honey. We have designed it so the Flow Key cap only fits when the cells are in the closed position.</p>
<p><strong>How much honey comes out of a Flow Hive?</strong><br/>About 5.5 - 6.5lbs per frame (2.5 - 3 kg), more if the bees really build each frame out. If you have seven frames in your Flow Super, then you can expect to harvest at least 45 lbs (20 kg) when every frame is full.</p>
<p><strong>Can the Flow Frames come out of the super like standard frames do?</strong><br/>Yes. This is important for inspections, and how most hives in the world work. However, there is no need to remove the frames in the normal operation of extracting honey.</p>
<p><strong>What extra equipment will I need to keep bees?</strong><br/>Though the Flow Hive makes harvesting honey easier, you will still need to open the hive to inspect its health as usual - for this you’ll need safety gear such as a bee suit, smoker and hive tool - <a href=""https://www.honeyflow.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">available on our website</a>. If you’re new to beekeeping, you should link up with an experienced beekeeper or join the Flow Community Forum to learn how to care for your bees.</p>
<p><strong>How do I know when to harvest the Flow Frames?</strong><br/>The end of each Flow Frame is visible by taking the cover off at the rear of the Flow Super and this can give you a good indication of when the frames are full. It is worth having a look at the bees regularly through this window as you’ll get to observe your hive’s activity and it doesn’t disturb the bees. You will see the bees depositing nectar in the cells and, when the cells are full, evaporate it into honey and seal them with a wax capping. You can harvest from a frame as soon as you see that it is full, although there is no hurry - the sealed honey will keep until it is convenient for you to drain it out of the hive.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need to smoke the Flow Hive?</strong><br/>Not when you are operating the Flow Frames or just viewing the bees. Smoke is usually used to calm the bees when the hive is opened. However, bees do react to the hive being jolted, so it’s a good idea to have a smoker on hand in case the bees do start getting aggressive. A little smoke puffed into the entrance of the hive and some puffed around the hive itself will tend to calm them down. You will still need a smoker when you do the routine inspection of the brood nest.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need to wear a bee suit, bee veil or gloves when I drain the honey out?</strong><br/>We do recommend you wear a bee protective suit, especially if you are new to beekeeping or have a new, unknown hive. Some beekeepers just use a veil, as being stung on the face, particularly up the nose, is painful and inconvenient!<br/>We have found we can work at the back of the hive without the bees seeming to notice our presence, however we highly recommend that you wear a bee suit or at least a veil until you get to know your bees.<br/>Beekeeping is a labour of love. As with all animal husbandry, it’s a pastime which requires knowledge, skill and dedication and which carries with it inherent risks. Sooner or later, all beekeepers get stung. Some people have severe allergies to bee stings, so please be aware of the potential hazards when considering whether beekeeping is right for you.<br/>Check out this <a href=""https://www.accreditedfirstaid.com.au/beekeeping-safety"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Flow-sponsored safety pamphlet</a> covering common beekeeping safety risks and first aid responses.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a best time of day to drain the honey from a hive using Flow Frames?</strong><br/>It is possible to harvest from a Flow Hive at any time of the day or night because the hive is not opened. It is not uncommon for bees to beard out the front of the hive when harvesting (as with conventional harvesting), so it is important to note that if you are expecting a cold night it is best to harvest in the morning or during the day.<br/>We have found the bees are calmest in the late afternoon, and at this time the honey in the hive is likely to be warmest and runs easily, therefore we tend to extract at this time.</p>
<p><strong>How often do I need to check the brood?</strong><br/>This depends on your location. Please check with beekeepers in your local area for recommended inspection schedules. If the hive is weak or showing signs of decreased activity it should also be inspected. Our invention changes the honey harvesting component of beekeeping, however all  other aspects of normal beekeeping care  still apply; beetles, mites, swarm control etc. The Flow Super observation windows do assist with allowing you to look into the hive and gauge the strength and health of the colony, however, brood inspections are still required.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need to leave some honey in the Flow Hive for the bees?</strong><br/>Yes, this applies to all beekeeping. Your bees need honey to get them through the times when there is no nectar available. The number of frames of honey that you leave depends on your climate. You should consult local beekeepers as to how much honey is required for overwinter.<br/>The Flow Frames make it easier to see how much honey is in your frames at any time, so you can learn to manage how much honey to harvest and how much to leave for the bees. You can even partially harvest individual Flow Frames.<br/>Watching the honey level change every day is quite fascinating and many beekeepers report that they can’t help but look on a daily basis.<br/>Some beekeepers do need to feed their bees overwinter to help them get through the cold winter months; this will depend on local climatic conditions. It is important to seek guidance from experienced beekeepers in your region to learn about overwintering practices. </p>
<p><strong>How do the bees know when to uncap the Flow Frames?</strong><br/>The bees are quick to notice when the cells are empty and set about uncapping it usually within 24-48 hours. They will then get to work repairing the cells in readiness to fill them with nectar, to turn into honey, again.</p>
<p><strong>Can you harvest beeswax from a Flow Frame?</strong><br/>Honey comes out of the Flow Frames free from wax and ready for the table. Bees use about 7lb honey to make 1lb of wax, as they do not need to rebuild the comb in the Flow Frames, this generally means improved honey production. Consequently, it is not possible to harvest wax from Flow Frames, however, if you are interested in being able to harvest wax and Flow Honey, have a look at our Flow Hive Hybrid 3 frame (for the best of both worlds). </p>
<p><strong>Do Flow Frames work with Australian native bees?</strong><br/>The Flow Frames are designed for use with the European Honey Bee, Apis Mellifera and cannot be used with Australian bees or on an Australian native bee hive. Australian Native bees have a completely different comb/pod structure and honey production pattern to the European honey bee.</p>
<p><strong>Are the Flow Frames BPA-free? </strong><br/>Yes. The manufacturers have assured us that all plastic in the Flow Frames is not only BPA-free, but it is not manufactured with bisphenol-S or any other bisphenol compounds.</p>

However, extracting honey from a conventional hive used to be a real labor of love: You’d have to suit up, smoke the bees, crack the hive open, lift out the frames, sweep off the bees, transport the frames to your honey shed, uncap each frame with a hot knife, stick the frames in a centrifuge, spin out the honey, filter out the wax and bee bits, fill your jars, take the empty frames back to the hive, open the hive again to replace them, then clean up all the mess. Phew!It was hot, sticky, heavy work, involving special equipment and lots of squashed bees.Not anymore!After a decade of tinkering, my dad Stu and I invented the beekeeper’s dream – the Flow Hive.It’s so much easier for the beekeeper and so much gentler on the bees.It makes harvesting honey as simple as turning a tap and watching as up to 4.5 lb (3kg) of pure fresh honey pours out into your jar from each Flow Frame. And because it’s completely unprocessed, it tastes amazingly good!  “This has all come about because of our love for the bees and an acknowledgement of how important they are, not only to the food we eat, but to all life on Earth.”- Stuart Anderson“If we look after the bees, they’ll look after us. And the honey really is an amazing bonus.”- Cedar Anderson

Keeping bees is such a joyful and rewarding pastime. It gives you the opportunity to observe the interconnectedness of life, to appreciate the changing seasons in a new way, and to play an active role in contributing to the health of your environment. 
As you get to know your bees, you’ll discover many fascinating aspects of their behaviour. You’ll start to notice little things like how they communicate with each other, the way they construct honeycomb, and which plants are in flower throughout the year. Plus, of course, there’s also the sweetness of having honey to share with your family and neighbours.

“Ya know, I think the most interesting part about the honey coming out of the Flow Hive is the difference in each frame of honey.
And so, harvesting a frame of honey and just being able to smell it like a glass of wine and actually the floral notes are there. I mean, if you smell a bottle of honey that's been extracted, it just, it's not the same.”
- Jeff Walker, Texas
As bees tend to focus on filling one individual Flow Frame before moving on to the next, even within a single Flow Hive, the flavour will vary between frames depending on the forage available.
Flow technology allows those single origin flavours to shine through, while eliminating the incidental blending and the oxidation associated with conventional methods.

FLOW HIVE & BEEKEEPING BASICS:
What is a Flow Hive?A Flow Hive is our complete beehive comprising of a brood box and Flow Super (which contains our patented Flow Frames), plus a roof and screened baseboard, inner cover and queen excluder. We may also refer to any beehive with at least one brood box and one or more Flow Supers for honey storage and harvest as a Flow Hive. A honeybee hive is usually made up of two boxes; the brood box where the queen bee lays eggs, and the ‘super’ with honeycomb for the storage of honey. A ‘Flow Super’ is a beehive box using Flow Frames that the bees store honey in.
What are Flow Frames?“Flow” is the name of our revolutionary invention that allows honey to be harvested directly from the hive without opening the hive and with little disturbance to the bees. The Flow Frames are the honey storage frames for use in the super box that make this possible.
How do the Flow Frames work?The Flow Frame consists of already partly formed honeycomb cells. The bees complete the comb with their wax, fill the cells with honey and cap the cells as usual. When you turn the Flow Key, the cells split vertically inside the comb forming channels, allowing the honey to flow down to a sealed trough at the base of the frame and out of the hive - a bit like a tap - while the bees are practically undisturbed on the comb surface.When the honey has finished draining, you turn the Flow Key again in the upper slot, resetting the comb into the original position. The bees then sense the comb is empty, chew the wax capping away, and start to fill it with nectar again.
How are 2nd Generation Flow Frames different to the original Flow Frames?Both our Flow Hive 2 and Flow Hive Classic come with generation 2 Flow Frames.These contain lots of minor improvements for better functionality, durability and to further minimise any disturbance to the bees during harvest. These include:

Adjustments in the cell depth of the moving comb blade, so the movement that forms channels through the comb happens deeper beneath the bees feet for minimal disturbance, this also allows the bees to draw out their comb further.
A decrease in the cell wall thickness results in a slight increase in the amount of honey that can be stored and harvested from each Flow Frame.
The central spine of the moving parts is now more robust offering more durability.
An increase in the reset and lift pressure from the Flow Key is added for better functionality.
Added radiuses and angles for easier insertion of the Flow Frames when beekeeping.
Some cosmetic rounded edges have been added on the front lower transparent end.
Tighter securing cables hold the frame together more securely.
Upper and lower frame caps now have a handle negating the need for pliers to remove.

How do I stop the bees getting to the honey while it's draining out of the Flow Hive?Quite often we can drain the honey out without the bees even noticing us at the back of the hive, but sometimes they may be attracted to the honey and you will need to cover the jars, or better still, make a sealed system. This can be achieved by simply making a hole in the lid of a jar for a tube to go into.  If you are using a bucket, you can put many holes through the lid of the bucket or make up a manifold.
Do the bees willingly fill the Flow Frames compared to conventional wax foundation?The speed at which the bees fill the Flow Frames for the first time in comparison to conventional frames will vary greatly from colony to colony. Some bees will start to fill them quickly whilst other can take longer. There are many methods that can be used to encourage a slow colony to get working on the frames, see our FAQ here for further information. We have found that once the bees have completed the frames for the first time they no longer seem to show  a preference either way and readily start building on, and filling the Flow Frames at the same time as the traditional ones.
How long does it take before I can drain the honey from the Flow Hive?This depends on the amount of nectar available in your region for the bees and how strong the colony is. Most colonies will need time to establish in the brood box before the Flow Super can be added to the hive, which can take weeks to months depending on the strength of the colony, method of installation, time of year and available forage. Once the super has been added to the hive and there is a good nectar flow available, progress can be pretty fast. We have had Flow Supers that have filled in one week during peak times of the flowering season, however, with a strong colony and good nectar source you can usually expect honey with a month or two.  
How long does it take for the honey to drain out?Anything from twenty minutes to over two hours depending on the temperature and the viscosity of the honey. It is even OK to leave it draining overnight (if it is secure from nocturnal animals). When you have finished draining the honey remember to return the frames to ‘closed cell’ position so that the bees can seal the broken cells and recommence filling them with more honey. We have designed it so the Flow Key cap only fits when the cells are in the closed position.
How much honey comes out of a Flow Hive?About 5.5 - 6.5lbs per frame (2.5 - 3 kg), more if the bees really build each frame out. If you have seven frames in your Flow Super, then you can expect to harvest at least 45 lbs (20 kg) when every frame is full.
Can the Flow Frames come out of the super like standard frames do?Yes. This is important for inspections, and how most hives in the world work. However, there is no need to remove the frames in the normal operation of extracting honey.
What extra equipment will I need to keep bees?Though the Flow Hive makes harvesting honey easier, you will still need to open the hive to inspect its health as usual - for this you’ll need safety gear such as a bee suit, smoker and hive tool - available on our website. If you’re new to beekeeping, you should link up with an experienced beekeeper or join the Flow Community Forum to learn how to care for your bees.
How do I know when to harvest the Flow Frames?The end of each Flow Frame is visible by taking the cover off at the rear of the Flow Super and this can give you a good indication of when the frames are full. It is worth having a look at the bees regularly through this window as you’ll get to observe your hive’s activity and it doesn’t disturb the bees. You will see the bees depositing nectar in the cells and, when the cells are full, evaporate it into honey and seal them with a wax capping. You can harvest from a frame as soon as you see that it is full, although there is no hurry - the sealed honey will keep until it is convenient for you to drain it out of the hive.
Do I need to smoke the Flow Hive?Not when you are operating the Flow Frames or just viewing the bees. Smoke is usually used to calm the bees when the hive is opened. However, bees do react to the hive being jolted, so it’s a good idea to have a smoker on hand in case the bees do start getting aggressive. A little smoke puffed into the entrance of the hive and some puffed around the hive itself will tend to calm them down. You will still need a smoker when you do the routine inspection of the brood nest.
Do I need to wear a bee suit, bee veil or gloves when I drain the honey out?We do recommend you wear a bee protective suit, especially if you are new to beekeeping or have a new, unknown hive. Some beekeepers just use a veil, as being stung on the face, particularly up the nose, is painful and inconvenient!We have found we can work at the back of the hive without the bees seeming to notice our presence, however we highly recommend that you wear a bee suit or at least a veil until you get to know your bees.Beekeeping is a labour of love. As with all animal husbandry, it’s a pastime which requires knowledge, skill and dedication and which carries with it inherent risks. Sooner or later, all beekeepers get stung. Some people have severe allergies to bee stings, so please be aware of the potential hazards when considering whether beekeeping is right for you.Check out this Flow-sponsored safety pamphlet covering common beekeeping safety risks and first aid responses.
Is there a best time of day to drain the honey from a hive using Flow Frames?It is possible to harvest from a Flow Hive at any time of the day or night because the hive is not opened. It is not uncommon for bees to beard out the front of the hive when harvesting (as with conventional harvesting), so it is important to note that if you are expecting a cold night it is best to harvest in the morning or during the day.We have found the bees are calmest in the late afternoon, and at this time the honey in the hive is likely to be warmest and runs easily, therefore we tend to extract at this time.
How often do I need to check the brood?This depends on your location. Please check with beekeepers in your local area for recommended inspection schedules. If the hive is weak or showing signs of decreased activity it should also be inspected. Our invention changes the honey harvesting component of beekeeping, however all  other aspects of normal beekeeping care  still apply; beetles, mites, swarm control etc. The Flow Super observation windows do assist with allowing you to look into the hive and gauge the strength and health of the colony, however, brood inspections are still required.
Do I need to leave some honey in the Flow Hive for the bees?Yes, this applies to all beekeeping. Your bees need honey to get them through the times when there is no nectar available. The number of frames of honey that you leave depends on your climate. You should consult local beekeepers as to how much honey is required for overwinter.The Flow Frames make it easier to see how much honey is in your frames at any time, so you can learn to manage how much honey to harvest and how much to leave for the bees. You can even partially harvest individual Flow Frames.Watching the honey level change every day is quite fascinating and many beekeepers report that they can’t help but look on a daily basis.Some beekeepers do need to feed their bees overwinter to help them get through the cold winter months; this will depend on local climatic conditions. It is important to seek guidance from experienced beekeepers in your region to learn about overwintering practices. 
How do the bees know when to uncap the Flow Frames?The bees are quick to notice when the cells are empty and set about uncapping it usually within 24-48 hours. They will then get to work repairing the cells in readiness to fill them with nectar, to turn into honey, again.
Can you harvest beeswax from a Flow Frame?Honey comes out of the Flow Frames free from wax and ready for the table. Bees use about 7lb honey to make 1lb of wax, as they do not need to rebuild the comb in the Flow Frames, this generally means improved honey production. Consequently, it is not possible to harvest wax from Flow Frames, however, if you are interested in being able to harvest wax and Flow Honey, have a look at our Flow Hive Hybrid 3 frame (for the best of both worlds). 
Do Flow Frames work with Australian native bees?The Flow Frames are designed for use with the European Honey Bee, Apis Mellifera and cannot be used with Australian bees or on an Australian native bee hive. Australian Native bees have a completely different comb/pod structure and honey production pattern to the European honey bee.
Are the Flow Frames BPA-free? Yes. The manufacturers have assured us that all plastic in the Flow Frames is not only BPA-free, but it is not manufactured with bisphenol-S or any other bisphenol compounds.

We have been in the power and charging industry for almost 2.5 decades providing private label products for many companies and organizations over the years. However, making products for others have not allowed us to tell the story the products ourselves.When we started the design of our first DroneMax 360 we thought the product was so unique that it would only be right that we tell the story of DroneMax 360 to our end customers directly. With our experience bringing products to market on channels such as Amazon, Best Buy, and B & H Photo, we decided to bring DroneMax 360 directly to you to help us craft the perfect all around (360) portable charging station. Designed for drone users and versatile enough to support you and all your devices in any given situation. 

Don’t let the name fool you; DroneMax 360 is the ideal travel accessory because it is an all around compact charging solution even if you are not using it for flying drones.Enjoy 4 points of access to type A & C USB ports with QuickCharge 3.0 compatibility so you can quickly and SAFELY charge your devices such as a GoPro and Bluetooth speaker while hanging with friends at the beach or camping in the woods. No need to purchase additional accessories, DroneMax 360 comes with everything you need to charge up to 10 devices simultaneously.Use DroneMax 360 and the included cigarette lighter adapter to charge your devices in your car without running the risk of draining your car battery charging directly from your car’s battery.  Rubber bumper prevents scratches while it is jostled in bags taking out on location.  Aluminum body protect the inner components from physical and temperature damage.",46.0,2,"1 Campaign

Our Story
Some years ago we had a water main pipe breakage at our company.  The cleaning crew did a great job but we were never sure how clean the place was. 
Being the experts we are with high temperature steam, we decided to pursue sterility level cleaning. The MightySteam® technology soon emerged as a new way to make instant steam that could eliminate any microbe within seconds.     
Reliable portable models – SaniZap® solves this problem with cutting-edge, highly innovative products, covered by several patents.

""Enveloped viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 and HIV can be readily inactivated with heat.   The Bayzi Corporation target for employing high temperatures that are capable of inactivating viruses within a few seconds with steam appears to me to be highly likely to succeed."" Albert B. Sabin Professor and Director, Infectious Diseases, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center
Bayzi has created a Science and Engineering team with experts from from Universities, Hospitals and EPA.

A brand-new technology platform for antimicrobial, antipathogen, and general cleaning to provide a green and healthy alternative to toxic chemical sanitizers.

Compare the SaniZap® models

Why is SaniZap® Technology unique?
Differentiated

SaniZap® requires no pressure to deliver the same steam quality as the traditional slow autoclaves (World War II era technology)
Utilizes much less energy compared to autoclaves
Open, directed, non-wetting steam sanitation is possible for the first time.  If used properly, high sterility levels are anticipated.

Disruptive

Ability to deliver high steam temperatures up to 600°C to kill new and resistant strains of micro-organisms.
Rapid velocity
Unusual steam quality.  The first steam to self dry on impacting a surface.
Based on  published journal reports and other data, rapid antimicrobial efficacy is anticipated. Let us be prepared for possible future pandemics.

Defendable
 Patents (over four already allowed and several in the pipeline) will provide a sustainable competitive position.

""I have bought and used many steam cleaners. This is the only one I have real confidence in for cleaning bacteria."" -First impressions from a restaurant owner (formerly a nurse) who used the SaniZap prototype to deep-clean during the Coronavirus shut-down.
""I cannot give a more resounding thumbs-up for cleaning dust with antimicrobial steam.  Our factory over the years had accumulated a lot of dust – and lots of dust mites.  With the SaniZap 600-4-240 I was able to have all places easily dusted within a few hours.  No sneezing, so I imagine it must have killed all the dust mites.  I feel it is the best antimicrobial technique.  All factories, laboratories and warehouses will benefit. We will be using it for years.  Congratulations.""

Vlado studied machine industry at the University and I studied electrical engineering after finishing high school. After long years our paths crossed and we started to work together on the idea of a new motor type with external combustion, on a new steam engine with a rotary piston. The new steam motor’s piston move is delivered from the piston movement of Wankelov’s motor. Maybe you are asking yourself: why is it necessary to develop a new motor? The answer is easy: Because such a motor is adequate and necessary in the field of small and decentralized production of electric energy. Mainly, for the production of electric energy from biomass or lost heat. In the micro-power plant this new motor is powered by an electric generator. We are supporters of renewable resources of electric energy and are also convinced that people should more often use renewable resources like the sun, water, air, biomass, waste or geothermal energy in electric energy production. The solution can be seen in the decentralized production of electric energy. We believe that the future of electric energy production is in small micro- and mini-power plants that citizens and companies will own in the same normal way like they own cars and refrigerators. The decentralized way of producing electric energy facilitates to use of more effective renewable resources, increases energetic independency and secures the protection of households and companies against electric energy cut in natural disasters like floods, snowstorms and tornadoes.</p><p>Today we have a functional prototype of new steam motor with rotary piston. We test it in a small micro-power plant whose electric capacity is around 3 kW.</p><p>The new  engine is unique. It is small, responsible, compact, and efficient. At constant speed it has minimal vibrations. We have two European patent applications on the new motor:</p><p>                                                 <a href=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481656020/ivypqmt1hjqhfc6doxyh.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481563356/zdhs41yrul7cdymo8xuk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a>                <a href=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481656040/knlmv3zsn1o45t1jnxka.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481564115/r09uhhy2gvpn6ze1dik9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></a></p><p> </p><p><strong>Description of motor functioning:</strong>                                 <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481565105/zbapfivnu3jumh7wfoax.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p><p>A work medium (water vapor) is heated in a boiler out of the motor box. The heated vapor (red) flows towards two initial valves on the motor box after reaching a certain pressure. The motor’s initial valves are opened and closed in turns.</p><p>Firstly, the vapor, entering into the motor’s working chambers, gives its kinetic energy to the piston side and forces it in move. The vapor in the chamber expands itself, pushes in the piston side and forces it to move after closing the initial valves.</p><p>The piston pushes on the eccentric shaft, which is forced together with all shafts into rotation. The rotating shaft transfers the energy through the belt on the electric generator. The average speed of the motor shaft represents 1,500 rpm per min.</p><p>The vapor that gave its energy to the motor piston gets off the motor through final valves (blue) and in the heat exchanger becomes colder and condenses into water. Water – condensate is pressed back into the boiler by a pump. The water is reheated in the boiler, and then changes in the vapor and again goes in the motor.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481566458/jjbrqxk5hettpkspjfjl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>Technical data of micro-power plant:</strong></p><table border=""1"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0""><tbody>

Vlado studied machine industry at the University and I studied electrical engineering after finishing high school. After long years our paths crossed and we started to work together on the idea of a new motor type with external combustion, on a new steam engine with a rotary piston. The new steam motor’s piston move is delivered from the piston movement of Wankelov’s motor. Maybe you are asking yourself: why is it necessary to develop a new motor? The answer is easy: Because such a motor is adequate and necessary in the field of small and decentralized production of electric energy. Mainly, for the production of electric energy from biomass or lost heat. In the micro-power plant this new motor is powered by an electric generator. We are supporters of renewable resources of electric energy and are also convinced that people should more often use renewable resources like the sun, water, air, biomass, waste or geothermal energy in electric energy production. The solution can be seen in the decentralized production of electric energy. We believe that the future of electric energy production is in small micro- and mini-power plants that citizens and companies will own in the same normal way like they own cars and refrigerators. The decentralized way of producing electric energy facilitates to use of more effective renewable resources, increases energetic independency and secures the protection of households and companies against electric energy cut in natural disasters like floods, snowstorms and tornadoes.Today we have a functional prototype of new steam motor with rotary piston. We test it in a small micro-power plant whose electric capacity is around 3 kW.The new  engine is unique. It is small, responsible, compact, and efficient. At constant speed it has minimal vibrations. We have two European patent applications on the new motor:                                                                  Description of motor functioning:                                 A work medium (water vapor) is heated in a boiler out of the motor box. The heated vapor (red) flows towards two initial valves on the motor box after reaching a certain pressure. The motor’s initial valves are opened and closed in turns.Firstly, the vapor, entering into the motor’s working chambers, gives its kinetic energy to the piston side and forces it in move. The vapor in the chamber expands itself, pushes in the piston side and forces it to move after closing the initial valves.The piston pushes on the eccentric shaft, which is forced together with all shafts into rotation. The rotating shaft transfers the energy through the belt on the electric generator. The average speed of the motor shaft represents 1,500 rpm per min.The vapor that gave its energy to the motor piston gets off the motor through final valves (blue) and in the heat exchanger becomes colder and condenses into water. Water – condensate is pressed back into the boiler by a pump. The water is reheated in the boiler, and then changes in the vapor and again goes in the motor.Technical data of micro-power plant:

                                          The production of these micro-power plants with new motor with rotary piston will bring households, which today heat their houses and offices with biomass, a greater independency from electric energy distributors. It will bring money saving for high electric energy bills. Simultaneously, it will protect households against electric energy cuts in the case of bad weather, like floods, snowstorms or tornadoes. Thousands of households and companies often remain without electric energy after such disasters.Small micro-power plants for biomass brings benefits to many companies. For instance, to wood manufacturers, like sawmills or furniture producers that produce an amount of wood waste. Today, this waste on sawmills and from furniture production is used on heat production. The new micro-power plant manages to make even electric energy from this waste. Also, the efficiency of waste use will increase and enterprisers will save money from electric energy purchase.The production and installation of small micro-power plants on biomass can bring electric energy also in faraway and underdeveloped parts of our planet. More often they are areas where there is a sufficiency of labor as well as huge possibilities to cultivate, harvest and process biomass.Planned events:Goal: 30,000Plan number 1:  To prepare manufacturing drawings and building instructions based on the existing prototype.

We are passionate about producing clean energy and HandEnergy is our contribution to that.We believe our HandEnergy will help people in developing countries with poor electricity coverage to be closer to the internet and education by having their smartphones always on. We will work with United Nations to bring this idea to live.   Follow us",39.0,2,"2 Campaigns

<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p><strong>MANUFACTURING:</strong></p>
<p>•We’ve made a test run of 1000 pieces and found a few improvements for the final product, because of this test we are confident that everything will be going smoothly, but unforeseen things might occur, if this should happen we promise to communicate honestly about it, please read our updates here on IndieGoGo for more information.</p>
<p>•We have chosen the same manufacture as we use for LastSwab + an extra manufacture so if something will cause a delay, we will hopefully still be able to ensure timely delivery.</p>
<p><strong>SHIPPING:</strong></p>
<p>•We will start sending LastTissue boxes out as soon as all orders are packed and sent to our two fulfillment services in Texas (The US) and Copenhagen (Denmark).</p>
<p>•Please note that if you live outside The US and Europe you will be responsible for duties, fees, and taxes applicable to your region. PRODUCT GUARANTEE:</p>
<p>•LastTissue comes with a two-year warranty. Should you experience problems with defects you can send it back to us, we’ll happily recycle it and send you a new one for free.</p>
<p>•And remember ''There Is No Planet B''</p>
<p>•Please help us spread the word by sharing our links above.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Environmental commitments</strong></p>
<p><strong>Long-lasting design</strong></p>
<p>The silicone case will last you a lifetime. The tissues can be washed 500 times each. Psst probably longer.</p>
<p><strong>Reusability and recyclability</strong></p>

 We would like to introduce you to LastTissue. It’s like if a handkerchief and a tissue pack had a baby.We're bringing you the best of both worlds: the easy, on-the-go availability of the tissue pack and the environmentally-friendly, soft-on-the-nose handkerchief. We want to bring the handkerchief back into mainstream culture.How it Works 
 Simply take a tissue from the bottom, use it, and then store it on top of the marked-tissue barrier. This way, you’ll push the clean tissues down, making them ready to use and dividing them from the used. You’ll know you’re on your last tissue when the marked one appears - that means it’s cleaning time. After washing, you repack and use them all over again.Tissues cause more damage than you might thinkThe paper and pulp industry is the third-largest industrial emitter of global warming gasses. Every year around 8,000,000 trees are cut down to make facial tissues for the US alone. Deforestation can lead to a direct loss of wildlife habitat.  The removal of trees reduces available food, shelter, and breeding habitat. It also removes the miraculous effect the trees have of cleaning our carbon emissions to breathable oxygen - helping to prevent climate change.  Every time you blow your nose with a LastTissue, you save 2 liters of water.⚡It takes 3 times more energy to produce paper tissues compared to the reusable cotton tissues.With one LastTissue pack, you will save the planet from more than 2800 single-use tissues as well as their plastic packaging.Making reusable the standard


Imagine a world with more trees, less production⚙️, less shipping✈️ , and less CO2 emissions. Imagine a world with objects that last. Together let us reduce - and even eliminate - the need for single-use products.
Every day 22,000 trees are cut down just to supply facial tissues for The US. Imagine how many trees are cut down worldwide. This is simply unnecessary. Reusability can make a huge difference.     
  


representing endangered animals 
137 species of animals are going extinct every day because of deforestation.  Our five colors represent five species that are endangered due to deforestation.  Raccoon Blue. The pygmy raccoon, is a critically endangered species off the coast of Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico.Dragonfly Turquoise. 163 Mediterranean dragonflies and damselflies show that five species are critically endangered.Fox Peach. Darwin’s fox originally found in southern temperate rain forests is considered to have the highest extinction risk of any Chilean mammals.Palm Green. With only 40 trees left in the wild, the Carpoxylon Palm is listed as Critically Endangered.Redwood Red. The redwood species contains the largest and tallest trees in the world. Endangered due to habitat losses.NEWS!! Our backers have wished for a black, so we've made it in black.Bat Black. Fruit bats are critical plant pollinators, and their distribution of seeds from the wild fruit that they eat helps forests grow back.  71,910 km² of forest is cut down every year to make single-use tissues for the US alone. That's the size of Rhode Island, Delaware, Connecticut, New Jersey, and New Hampshire COMBINED, and this is for something you use ones and throw away. By reusing we are eliminating the need for a product that uses our resources, is manufactured, packaged and shipped constantly. In the long run, you save money, save the planet and in this case a whole lot of trees!  Change our everyday actions in order to change our lives and the world will change with us. 
 Please help us grow the LastTissue community and reduce the deforestation of our earth. Click on a button below and spread some love for the planet. 
  
  
 
 Change your habits for the good of the planet in a fuss-free way. Buy LastTissue once, cross single-use tissues off your shopping list forever, and do your bit for the environment. Easy.  
 
 
behind LastSwab
 Last year we made LastSwab that was crowdfunded with more than 30,000 backers (THANK YOU).The last year has been quite a ride. We have learned the following, be 100% sure we are shipping plastic-free, be 100% sure we are shipping EU and US-friendly, make all molds before launch, do a test-production run before launch and make sure to deliver on time or before promises. Everything has been set up, we are ready and so excited to share LastTissue with all of you. We just hope that Murphy and his Law don't come around. If he does, we will work around the clock until we've fixed the issues and we promise to communicate openly about everything. 
 Nicolas Aagaard (left) has created industrial design for a number of years. He is our the-big-picture, this-can-be-scaled, rendering expert, excel and business shark designer.Isabel Aagaard (center) has a background in designing medical equipment. She is our graphical quality first, GIF fanatic, coffee brewing, scissor cutout ✂️, eco collaborative designer.Kåre Frandsen (right) is trained as a cabinetmaker. He is our hands-on, built-a-set-in-a-day, i-can-use-all-tools, cleaning expert, never negative, real prototype and production expert designer. 
 At LastObject we are always dedicated to creating sustainable alternatives to single-use items in pursuit of a cleaner environment. Since our successful launch on Indiegogo with LastSwab our small team has crowned into a handful of Waste Warriors that share the same goal from all over the globe.-To eliminate single-use items globally- 

 
  
In collaboration with     
 We work with trusted American, Canadian and French partners that have all been sourcing out of China for more than 10 years. They take pride in making sure all their factories have verified certification. Good work conditions, a responsible supply of materials and recycling are all areas that are supported in our factories.  From our last Kickstarter (LastSwab) we learned that tooling (molds) and tests take an awfully long time, so this time everything has been sourced beforehand and all molds tested. We have even made a test production of 1000 pieces that have been handed out to people for testing and feedback. We have done this so you can receive a high-quality product within three months of the campaign ending. 

 All pledges are shipped from Denmark with the exception of US addresses, they will be shipped from the US. This way no Europeans or US citizens will be taxed or charged extra VAT.We are shipping 100% plastic-free. Please note that people living outside of Europe and The US will be responsible for duties, fees and taxes applicable to their region.

Risks and challenges
MANUFACTURING:
•We’ve made a test run of 1000 pieces and found a few improvements for the final product, because of this test we are confident that everything will be going smoothly, but unforeseen things might occur, if this should happen we promise to communicate honestly about it, please read our updates here on IndieGoGo for more information.
•We have chosen the same manufacture as we use for LastSwab + an extra manufacture so if something will cause a delay, we will hopefully still be able to ensure timely delivery.
SHIPPING:
•We will start sending LastTissue boxes out as soon as all orders are packed and sent to our two fulfillment services in Texas (The US) and Copenhagen (Denmark).
•Please note that if you live outside The US and Europe you will be responsible for duties, fees, and taxes applicable to your region. PRODUCT GUARANTEE:
•LastTissue comes with a two-year warranty. Should you experience problems with defects you can send it back to us, we’ll happily recycle it and send you a new one for free.
•And remember ''There Is No Planet B''
•Please help us spread the word by sharing our links above.

Much Smaller Capacity than actual Market requirement. </p><p>Therefore, CellsX had spent more than 3 years to make it smaller in Charging Rate from 60C to 10C  and Higher Capacity from 2400mah to 6000mah in Same size ( Shown as below) ,  and finally, the lastest battery cell was in mass production in Jan 2017 and We used to design the Gen 3rd Power Pack. </p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516370650/uswzeym05oxu6p9zwgsa.jpg"" src=""""/></h3><p>The idea of Apollo Power Bank is confirmed as USB C PD technology is more and more popular, in Gen 1 or Gen 2 Power Pack, it still needed separate adapter to charge it.

You needn’t bring a separate adapter with you, because it is compatible with USB C power adapters of Nintendo Switch, Apple MacBook, Lenovo laptop ,Dell laptop or HP laptop.If you have only old laptop chargers or MagSafe adapters, you can also use our Anywatt adapter to charge Apollo. Besides, Apollo supports 40W USB C PD output, which means it supports the Fast Charging of the latest iPhone 8 or iPhone X, or in an emergency, it supports emergency charge to your Apple Macboook .

Graphene Composite Battery InsideApollo realizes application of graphene composite cell to mobile power pack for the first time in the world (Graphene composite Provided by CellsX) . On the basis of the same capacity and the same charging current, the cell with graphene composite material has much smaller internal resistance and better conductivity. Therefore, the temperature rise is lower during super fast charging, so it is safer, and cell swelling and burning will never happen.Graphene Battery Charging Performance Test in 8C Rate ( 2500mAh cell Charging in 20A Current) Surface Temperature of  Graphene Battery Charging Performance Test in 8C Rate

</ol><h2>1. Summary</h2><p><br/>Two years ago, we started working on a new type of social network. We called it ‘Onlive’. The social network was intended to be the antidote to the big technology companies that have been busy connecting us with the online world. We’d imagine a platform that does the opposite: one that connects us with our offline worlds. One that stimulates face to face human interaction, encourages dialogue and the exchange of ideas, right here on the streets of our communities. We were trying to create a social network between the online world and the offline world. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570639166/wpo8ezbx4ynxi21ctbs6.png"" src=""""/></p><p>As the research progressed, we realized we were designing something more than a social network. We were designing an operating system (OS) for people to interact with their immediate physical world. An OS that connects you with the people, organizations, and technologies around you in real-time, offering relevant information and functionality for almost any conceivable situation. Our research project resulted in a prototype application for Android, a solid software architecture, a UX design and a thorough research report on our findings (READ ALL ABOUT THIS IN PART 3: THE OFFICIAL SMARTUP BUSINESS PLAN). </p><p>Now it is up to me to take this project to the next phase: creating a Minimal Viable Product (MVP), find the funding and set up a startup. The thing is, founding a startup might be considered the ‘logical’ next step, but is it the ‘best’ step? I think Onlive is something special and has the potential to offer counterweight against the dominance of traditional social networks. I believe Onlive can become a platform that can help us organize the online world in manageable and easy to use cards and make them applicable for use in our communities, where they can be of value the most.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570639291/ubrpzzwcmir5ymz54ubp.png"" src=""""/></p><p>At the same time, I am growing more aware of the scientific call for a fundamental system change. A change that is critical if we want to protect the only planet we have. I am convinced Onlive can contribute to one of the thousands of solutions that are needed in that quest. Specifically by being a trustworthy technology that will support us creating and applying these solutions faster but also because the same scientists urge us to attack the global problems from a local level. The idea is that if we all fix our own communities, we together, fix the world.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570639354/moh5ixo9jhskhd3o93tf.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Onlive is a tool designed to connect with our own communities. However, to become that tool it has to become the best version of itself. Anything less would make it just another social network. I realized I could not just follow the normal startup trajectory to ensure that. I needed to create a different environment. One that maximizes the chance for Onlive to become a reliable, robust and trustworthy technology that purely serves the planet and humanity, and not the bank account of its shareholders.</p><p>That is why I designed a new type of organization that I call the Smartup. In a Smartup we can own, create and govern our technologies and operate completely autonomously, independently and be self-sustained. It creates and exploits, like any other company, a product or service, while providing jobs for people. However, a Smartup is run as a democratic society where people decide together what we make, how we make it and, above all, why we should make it. The goal of a Smartup is to nurture great ideas for a better future and allow them to become the best versions of themselves. By democratizing the process of owning, building and governing technologies, we can create products and services that are useful to people in their efforts protecting our planet and humanity.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570639600/fbvxyc1iwwaj8vvvya9r.png"" src=""""/></p><p>I think Onlive is the perfect technology to test this idea. It’s a well-researched project about a new medium that wants people to use the online world to improve their own local world. I've set up operation Smartup Zero and am recruiting right now. I ask you to join me and be my co-pioneer, embrace the potential and work hard on realizing it. Let’s prove there is a different path. One that enables everyone of us to collectively be part of the solution, a channel for our energy, love and talent. Let's unlock the true potential of the internet by building our own operating system, unlocking not just the best of the online world, but reconnecting us to with our local communities. In my essay ‘Smartup Zero: a blueprint for disruption’ I’ll show you how this new OS will help us navigate through a blizzard of problems that undeniably are coming at us, if they are not already here. </p><h2>2.

I believe Onlive can become a platform that can help us organize the online world in manageable and easy to use cards and make them applicable for use in our communities, where they can be of value the most.At the same time, I am growing more aware of the scientific call for a fundamental system change. A change that is critical if we want to protect the only planet we have. I am convinced Onlive can contribute to one of the thousands of solutions that are needed in that quest. Specifically by being a trustworthy technology that will support us creating and applying these solutions faster but also because the same scientists urge us to attack the global problems from a local level. The idea is that if we all fix our own communities, we together, fix the world.Onlive is a tool designed to connect with our own communities. However, to become that tool it has to become the best version of itself. Anything less would make it just another social network. I realized I could not just follow the normal startup trajectory to ensure that. I needed to create a different environment. One that maximizes the chance for Onlive to become a reliable, robust and trustworthy technology that purely serves the planet and humanity, and not the bank account of its shareholders.That is why I designed a new type of organization that I call the Smartup. In a Smartup we can own, create and govern our technologies and operate completely autonomously, independently and be self-sustained. It creates and exploits, like any other company, a product or service, while providing jobs for people. However, a Smartup is run as a democratic society where people decide together what we make, how we make it and, above all, why we should make it. The goal of a Smartup is to nurture great ideas for a better future and allow them to become the best versions of themselves. By democratizing the process of owning, building and governing technologies, we can create products and services that are useful to people in their efforts protecting our planet and humanity.I think Onlive is the perfect technology to test this idea. It’s a well-researched project about a new medium that wants people to use the online world to improve their own local world. I've set up operation Smartup Zero and am recruiting right now. I ask you to join me and be my co-pioneer, embrace the potential and work hard on realizing it. Let’s prove there is a different path. One that enables everyone of us to collectively be part of the solution, a channel for our energy, love and talent. Let's unlock the true potential of the internet by building our own operating system, unlocking not just the best of the online world, but reconnecting us to with our local communities. In my essay ‘Smartup Zero: a blueprint for disruption’ I’ll show you how this new OS will help us navigate through a blizzard of problems that undeniably are coming at us, if they are not already here. 2. A quick guide to Smartup: 3. The official Smartup Business Plan 1-10-2019  Smartup Zero - The Official Smartup Business Plan (Validation Ready) -Onlive: the social information network for the real world. This is the start of the validation round for Smartup Zero. We are finding out if there is enough will to share ownership in the Onlive proposition. We measure that viability in this round by selling Smartup Ownership.Smartup OwnershipBeing an owner of a Smartup is not about who created the idea or had the money to invest, it's about who is willing to own and grow an idea into the best version it can become. The more people step up to that plate, the healthier your Smartup becomes, the better the product or service it produces and the higher the profits that return from the market will be.In a lot of ways, being the owner of a Smartup is more being like being a citizen of a new country than a shareholder of a new company. You are expected to contribute to the creation of the country.You've got all kinds of rights and at least one obligation: to be responsible for what the Smartup is creating. With your rights, you can perform that responsibility. You've got the right to vote, supervise and work but are also obliged to offer your best and participate in good faith and with good intention if you want to keep those rights.To show your good faith and good intention as an owner, you can get busy with two processes in a Smartup:
To Work 
To Govern 
​You work for money and you govern for the protection of the mission and vision. Ideally, you do both with the same intensity. There are a lot more things to understand about the concept of a Smartup, but in essence, it's about your will to own Onlive with me. if you do, than buy one of the perks and I'll see you in the first Smartup in the world.",33.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Une illustration de la maison modulaire. Panneau composé de paille et de bois</strong></p>
<p><strong><i>Qui suis-je ?</i></strong></p>
<p>Je suis informaticien de métier, passionné de technologie, je réalise des meubles et des projets électroniques depuis l’âge de 15 ans, j’ai été intégrateur de solution domotique pendant près de 5 ans. J’aimerais améliorer notre monde d’aujourd’hui et de demain pour nos enfants. Depuis plusieurs années je suis devenu sensible à notre environnement, à notre façon de gérer nos ressources et les aliments que nous consommons.</p>
<p>Je rêve depuis de nombreuses années de la ville « parfaite » qui à mes yeux serait autonome en ressource comme l’électricité, autonome en nourriture grâce à des serres aquaponie qui permettraient de nourrir des familles entières en économisant l’eau et en fournissant des aliments de qualité. Une ville intelligente avec des véhicules (voitures, bus, métro, train, etc.) autonomes qui communiqueraient entre eux afin d’éliminer les accidents, les embouteillages, la pollution.</p>
<p>Mais avant d’atteindre ce résultat, il faut que nous travaillions tous ensemble pour arriver à améliorer nos logements et notre façon de consommer nos ressources. C’est pour cette raison que je lance cette campagne.</p>
<p><strong><i>Grâce à vous !</i></strong></p>
<p>En finançant ce projet, nous pourrons réaliser cette maison passive et nous allons créer une communauté d’auto constructeur par région. Des constructions réalisées en groupe d'amis et de parents. Dans ce modèle de <strong>production sociale</strong>, chacun apporte ses connaissances, et ses expériences, ce qui permet également de faire des ateliers éducatifs intéressants et conviviaux.</p>
<p>Les bibliothèques mises à disposition sont entièrement Open source, ce qui signifie que non seulement vous pouvez les utiliser gratuitement, mais également toute personne peut proposer des plans, des réalisations, des tutos.</p>
<p>La contribution d’une communauté mondiale permet également de répondre à des exigences spécifiques à tout type de climat, mais également à la disponibilité des matériaux et des spécificités culturelles.</p>
<p>Cette campagne de financement couvrira les frais suivants : </p>
<ul>
<li>Ingénieur bioclimatique</li>
<li>Architecte</li>
<li>Location d’un dépôt pour réaliser des prototypes</li>
<li>Achat d’équipements et de matériel</li>
<li>Poursuite du développement des différentes solutions pour réaliser une maison encore plus économe en énergie et toujours plus intelligente.</li>
<li>Développement de notre plateforme pour devenir la référence de l’Open source qui touche à la conception du logement et de son aménagement pour avoir une communauté importante et diversifiée à travers le monde.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><i>L'impact</i></strong></p>
<p>Nous pouvons faire changer la façon de se loger et d’utiliser nos ressources. Si nous sommes nombreux à réaliser des logements économes et passifs, nous réduirons considérablement l’impact négatif sur notre environnement. Nous laisserons à nos enfants les bons réflexes pour préserver notre terre et nous nourrir sainement.</p>
<p><strong><i>Risques et défis</i></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Les récompenses que nous proposons sont déjà en grande partie réalisées et en place, dès la fin de la campagne la plupart des contreparties seront accessibles.</li>
<li>Le site internet est déjà en place, il s’étoffe de semaine en semaine afin de fournir un contenu intéressant et varié.</li>
<li>Nous travaillons avec un ingénieur bioclimatique et un architecte pour la conception du logement et fournir des plans de qualité et surtout fonctionnels.</li>
<li>Nous sommes conscients que le projet est conséquent, que nous n’arriverons pas à sortir la maison parfaite tout de suite, c’est pour cette raison que nous ferons évoluer régulièrement les plans, et les documents mis à disposition.</li>
</ul>

<p><i><strong>The concept</strong></i></p>
<p>Let us carry out the altogether house of tomorrow!</p>
<p>Together we can create a home that meets all needs. A home that is smart, economical, ecological, self-sufficient, respects our environment and largely meets your food needs. An autonomous and passive house; Which does not require connection to: electricity, water, and no sewage system.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495376088/abolucimdznyicgnjtr7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>An illustration of the self-contained house</strong></p>
<p>It will also produce enough fruits and vegetables (about 400kg) all year round for the needs of a family of 4 to 5 people and about 40kg of fish. The greenhouse saves 90% of water compared to a conventional crop.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494678792/hylp4o9lb0zrlzg7ynql.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>An illustration of aquapony</strong></p>
<p>The house is designed to consume very little resources thanks to its realization of straw and wood, its orientation on the ground to benefit from the natural heating of the sun, the recovery of rainwater and the purification of the waste water by the plants . Solar panels on the roof and on the façade provide enough electricity for the house, the surplus is stored in batteries to restore electricity when night falls.</p>
<p>The home automation system in the housing allows meticulous management of electricity, it is able to cut the current of the outlets during your absence in order to eliminate the watches of the apparatuses, to turn off the lights that were lit by mistake. It also helps manage the greenhouse aquapony, to control the state of plants and the system remotely and at all times.</p>
<p>This concept can be used for a building, a house, and why by a restaurant ...</p>
<p>This type of accommodation usually costs more than a conventional dwelling, but in order to solve this problem we have considered a way to make this type of housing accessible to all. Open Source!</p>
<p>We work with architects and engineers to design housing, we work with open source solutions for the creation of heating panels, water recovery ponds, greenhouse, furniture and home automation. This saves more than 40% on the construction of the house. To reduce costs, we have created several open source libraries to help you realize your home economically and environmentally.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1497202462/kq49jkxur3xwjqjrsvep.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>They include plans, guides and tutorials for the construction and assembly of several elements that affect the ecology: solar energy, rainwater recovery, passive heating, bio-insulation and much more; Furniture, design of your home automation solution, multiple sensors and actuators.</p>
<p>All you have to do is contact one of our architect partners from different regions to adapt the plans according to your needs and your terrain.</p>

<p><i><strong>Who am I?</strong></i></p>
<p>I am IT engineer, impassioned technology, I have been making furniture and electronic projects since the age of 15 years, I was integrator of home automation solution for nearly 5 years. I would love to improve our world today and tomorrow for our children. For several years I have become sensitive to our environment, how we manage our resources and the foods we consume.</p>
<p>I dreamed since many years of the “perfect” city which in my eyes would be autonomous in resource like electricity, autonomous in food thanks to aquaponics greenhouse which would make it possible to nourish whole families by saving water and by providing food of quality. An intelligent city with autonomous vehicles (cars, bus, subway, train, etc.) which would communicate between them in order to eliminate accidents, congestions and pollution.</p>
<p>But to reach this result, it is necessary to work all together to manage improving our residences and our way of consuming our resources. For this reason I launch this campaign.</p>
<p>For several years I became sensitive to our environment, our way of managing our resources and the food we consume.</p>
<p><i><strong>Thank to you!</strong></i></p>
<p>By financing this project, we will be able to realize this passive house and we will create a community of auto constructor by region. Buildings made in groups of friends and relatives. In this model of social production, each brings his knowledge and his experiences, which also makes it possible to make educational workshops interesting and convivial.</p>
<p>The libraries made available are entirely open source, which means that not only you can use them for free, but also anyone can propose plans, realizations, tutorials.</p>
<p>The contribution of a global community also makes it possible to meet requirements specific to all types of climate, but also to the availability of materials and cultural specificities.</p>
<p>This fundraising campaign will cover the following costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bioclimatic engineer</li>
<li>Architect</li>
<li>Hiring of a space to construct prototypes</li>
<li>Purchase of equipment and material</li>
<li>Continuous development of various solutions to carry out an even more energy saver and increasingly more intelligent house.</li>
<li>Development of our platform to become the OpenSource reference which touches with the design of housing and its installation to have an important and diversified community throughout the world.</li>
</ul>
<p><i><strong>Impact</strong></i></p>
<p>We can make change the way of placing and of using our resources. If we are numerous to carry out sparing and passive residences, we will reduce considerably the negative impact on our environment. We will leave to our children the good reflexes to preserve our ground and to nourish ourselves healthily.</p>
<p><i><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></i></p>
<ul>
<li>The rewards which we propose are already mainly carried out and in place, as of the end of the campaign most counterparts will be accessible.</li>
<li>The website is already in places, it is packed week in week in order to provide interesting and varied contents.</li>
<li>We work with a bioclimatic engineer and an architect for the housing design and to provide quality  and especially functional plans.</li>
<li>We are conscious that the project is consequent, that we will not manage to leave the perfect house immediately, for this reason we will make evolve regularly plans, and documents placed at disposal.</li>
</ul>
<p><i><strong>Other ways of helping</strong></i></p>

Elles comprennent des plans, des guides et tutoriels pour la réalisation et le montage de plusieurs éléments qui touchent à l’écologie : Énergie solaire, récupération de l'eau de pluie, chauffage passif, bio-isolation et bien plus encore ; des meubles, la conception de votre solution domotique, de multiples capteurs et actionneurs.
Il vous suffira de prendre contact avec l’un de nos partenaires-architectes de différentes régions afin d’adapter les plans selon vos besoins et votre terrain.

Qui suis-je ?
Je suis informaticien de métier, passionné de technologie, je réalise des meubles et des projets électroniques depuis l’âge de 15 ans, j’ai été intégrateur de solution domotique pendant près de 5 ans. J’aimerais améliorer notre monde d’aujourd’hui et de demain pour nos enfants. Depuis plusieurs années je suis devenu sensible à notre environnement, à notre façon de gérer nos ressources et les aliments que nous consommons.
Je rêve depuis de nombreuses années de la ville « parfaite » qui à mes yeux serait autonome en ressource comme l’électricité, autonome en nourriture grâce à des serres aquaponie qui permettraient de nourrir des familles entières en économisant l’eau et en fournissant des aliments de qualité. Une ville intelligente avec des véhicules (voitures, bus, métro, train, etc.) autonomes qui communiqueraient entre eux afin d’éliminer les accidents, les embouteillages, la pollution.
Mais avant d’atteindre ce résultat, il faut que nous travaillions tous ensemble pour arriver à améliorer nos logements et notre façon de consommer nos ressources. C’est pour cette raison que je lance cette campagne.
Grâce à vous !
En finançant ce projet, nous pourrons réaliser cette maison passive et nous allons créer une communauté d’auto constructeur par région. Des constructions réalisées en groupe d'amis et de parents. Dans ce modèle de production sociale, chacun apporte ses connaissances, et ses expériences, ce qui permet également de faire des ateliers éducatifs intéressants et conviviaux.
Les bibliothèques mises à disposition sont entièrement Open source, ce qui signifie que non seulement vous pouvez les utiliser gratuitement, mais également toute personne peut proposer des plans, des réalisations, des tutos.
La contribution d’une communauté mondiale permet également de répondre à des exigences spécifiques à tout type de climat, mais également à la disponibilité des matériaux et des spécificités culturelles.
Cette campagne de financement couvrira les frais suivants : 

Ingénieur bioclimatique
Architecte
Location d’un dépôt pour réaliser des prototypes
Achat d’équipements et de matériel
Poursuite du développement des différentes solutions pour réaliser une maison encore plus économe en énergie et toujours plus intelligente.
Développement de notre plateforme pour devenir la référence de l’Open source qui touche à la conception du logement et de son aménagement pour avoir une communauté importante et diversifiée à travers le monde.

L'impact
Nous pouvons faire changer la façon de se loger et d’utiliser nos ressources. Si nous sommes nombreux à réaliser des logements économes et passifs, nous réduirons considérablement l’impact négatif sur notre environnement. Nous laisserons à nos enfants les bons réflexes pour préserver notre terre et nous nourrir sainement.
Risques et défis

Les récompenses que nous proposons sont déjà en grande partie réalisées et en place, dès la fin de la campagne la plupart des contreparties seront accessibles.
Le site internet est déjà en place, il s’étoffe de semaine en semaine afin de fournir un contenu intéressant et varié.
Nous travaillons avec un ingénieur bioclimatique et un architecte pour la conception du logement et fournir des plans de qualité et surtout fonctionnels.
Nous sommes conscients que le projet est conséquent, que nous n’arriverons pas à sortir la maison parfaite tout de suite, c’est pour cette raison que nous ferons évoluer régulièrement les plans, et les documents mis à disposition.

D'autres façons d'aider
Si vous n’avez pas la possibilité de soutenir financièrement notre projet, mais que vous souhaitez nous soutenir, n’hésitez pas à partager cette campagne sur les réseaux sociaux, à vos amis, familles et toute personne soucieuse de notre environnement.

The concept
Let us carry out the altogether house of tomorrow!
Together we can create a home that meets all needs. A home that is smart, economical, ecological, self-sufficient, respects our environment and largely meets your food needs. An autonomous and passive house; Which does not require connection to: electricity, water, and no sewage system.

An illustration of the self-contained house
It will also produce enough fruits and vegetables (about 400kg) all year round for the needs of a family of 4 to 5 people and about 40kg of fish. The greenhouse saves 90% of water compared to a conventional crop.

An illustration of aquapony
The house is designed to consume very little resources thanks to its realization of straw and wood, its orientation on the ground to benefit from the natural heating of the sun, the recovery of rainwater and the purification of the waste water by the plants . Solar panels on the roof and on the façade provide enough electricity for the house, the surplus is stored in batteries to restore electricity when night falls.
The home automation system in the housing allows meticulous management of electricity, it is able to cut the current of the outlets during your absence in order to eliminate the watches of the apparatuses, to turn off the lights that were lit by mistake. It also helps manage the greenhouse aquapony, to control the state of plants and the system remotely and at all times.
This concept can be used for a building, a house, and why by a restaurant ...
This type of accommodation usually costs more than a conventional dwelling, but in order to solve this problem we have considered a way to make this type of housing accessible to all. Open Source!
We work with architects and engineers to design housing, we work with open source solutions for the creation of heating panels, water recovery ponds, greenhouse, furniture and home automation. This saves more than 40% on the construction of the house. To reduce costs, we have created several open source libraries to help you realize your home economically and environmentally.

They include plans, guides and tutorials for the construction and assembly of several elements that affect the ecology: solar energy, rainwater recovery, passive heating, bio-insulation and much more; Furniture, design of your home automation solution, multiple sensors and actuators.
All you have to do is contact one of our architect partners from different regions to adapt the plans according to your needs and your terrain.

Who am I?
I am IT engineer, impassioned technology, I have been making furniture and electronic projects since the age of 15 years, I was integrator of home automation solution for nearly 5 years. I would love to improve our world today and tomorrow for our children. For several years I have become sensitive to our environment, how we manage our resources and the foods we consume.
I dreamed since many years of the “perfect” city which in my eyes would be autonomous in resource like electricity, autonomous in food thanks to aquaponics greenhouse which would make it possible to nourish whole families by saving water and by providing food of quality. An intelligent city with autonomous vehicles (cars, bus, subway, train, etc.) which would communicate between them in order to eliminate accidents, congestions and pollution.
But to reach this result, it is necessary to work all together to manage improving our residences and our way of consuming our resources. For this reason I launch this campaign.
For several years I became sensitive to our environment, our way of managing our resources and the food we consume.
Thank to you!
By financing this project, we will be able to realize this passive house and we will create a community of auto constructor by region. Buildings made in groups of friends and relatives. In this model of social production, each brings his knowledge and his experiences, which also makes it possible to make educational workshops interesting and convivial.
The libraries made available are entirely open source, which means that not only you can use them for free, but also anyone can propose plans, realizations, tutorials.
The contribution of a global community also makes it possible to meet requirements specific to all types of climate, but also to the availability of materials and cultural specificities.
This fundraising campaign will cover the following costs:

Bioclimatic engineer
Architect
Hiring of a space to construct prototypes
Purchase of equipment and material
Continuous development of various solutions to carry out an even more energy saver and increasingly more intelligent house.
Development of our platform to become the OpenSource reference which touches with the design of housing and its installation to have an important and diversified community throughout the world.

Impact
We can make change the way of placing and of using our resources. If we are numerous to carry out sparing and passive residences, we will reduce considerably the negative impact on our environment. We will leave to our children the good reflexes to preserve our ground and to nourish ourselves healthily.
Risks and challenges

The rewards which we propose are already mainly carried out and in place, as of the end of the campaign most counterparts will be accessible.
The website is already in places, it is packed week in week in order to provide interesting and varied contents.
We work with a bioclimatic engineer and an architect for the housing design and to provide quality  and especially functional plans.
We are conscious that the project is consequent, that we will not manage to leave the perfect house immediately, for this reason we will make evolve regularly plans, and documents placed at disposal.

Other ways of helping
If you don’t have the possibility of financially supporting our project, but you wish supporting us, don’t hesitate to share this campaign over social networks, with your friends, families and any concerned person of our environment.

All Dufsar Energy, LLC, products are manufactured in the United States.Smith & Sons, LLC, a 34-year old company, headquartered in Washington D.C. an alumni of Goldman Sachs 10,000 Small Businesses Program, will market, sell and distribute the eHub50 to federal, state & local government and commercial customers.  Smith & Sons, LLC aims to increase the local economy, by establishing a manufacturing plant to build the eHub50.The eHub50 was developed as a result of a trip that the founder of Dufsar Energy, LLC took to Ethiopia to visit his Grandmother. While in Ethiopia, he was unable to keep his communication devices powered. Recognizing that his Grandmother was impacted in the same manner. Not being able to find a reliable feature-rich solution for her compelled him to put his engineering expertise to work. Within 4-months, a prototype was developed, and after 20 -months of rigorous field-testing, the eHub50 was built. Today, more than 1,000 have been shipped all over the world without any recorded failures.​The collaboration between the companies is very complimentary, Dufsar Energy, LLC, will continue to innovate renewable energy products and Smith & Sons, LLC, will build a robust distribution system utilizing more than 34-years experience in the Nations Capital to get an eHub50 to everyone, everywhere. Smith & Sons, LLC, was the 2017 First Place Winner of the UPS X-Port Challenge Competition. PARTNERS",15.0,7,"1 Campaign

Dr. Kaplan discovered the first C. elegans sex pheromones which she published in Nature (2008). Then she found that other nematodes, including beneficial nematodes, use pheromones for other behaviors (PLoS 1, 2012). Karl Schiller is a seasoned entrepreneur with a background in Economics. Pheronym is his second start-up. <a href=""https://www.ars.usda.gov/people-locations/person?person-id=12032"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dr. David Shapiro-Ilan</a> is a research scientist at the USDA. His research focuses on using beneficial nematodes for sustainable pest control.  </p>
<p><q>“The mission to space will offer a novel perspective and provide new insights into nematode behavior; the unique microgravity environment will allow us to explore fundamental mechanisms in parasitism and pathogenesis”, said Dr. Shapiro-Ilan.</q></p>
<p>Your IndieGoGo contributions will support this incredibly important research in space and on Earth.​</p>
<h2>Mission Objectives</h2>
<p>The AstroNematode experiment will test the effects of microgravity on the movement and infection behavior of beneficial nematodes that control a wide array of insect pests in agriculture. </p>
<ol>
<li><p>To test whether beneficial nematodes produce the same pheromone composition in microgravity vs. on Earth</p></li>
<li><p>To test whether beneficial nematodes grown in microgravity have the same symbiotic bacteria as their parents on Earth</p></li>
<li>To determine whether beneficial nematodes can emerge from infected cadavers in microgravity</li>
<li>To determine whether beneficial nematodes can disperse and forage for new insects after emergence</li>
<li>To determine whether beneficial nematodes can infect insect hosts in microgravity</li>
<li>To determine how microgravity affects insect host physiology</li>
</ol>
<p>We will find out if beneficial nematodes are able to navigate through soil and infect insects, can reproduce, and if their symbiotic bacteria function normally in microgravity. We will also ascertain if the impact on insect host physiology is the same compared with what is observed on earth.</p>
<p>To address these questions, sealed soil columns containing nematodes and a model target pest (waxworms, Galleria mellonella) will be sent into space for 30 days. We will assess the results once the nematodes return to earth. We will conduct concurrent control experiments on Earth.</p>

Karl Schiller and Dr. Fatma Kaplan are co-founders of Pheronym, bio-ag-tech pest control company that uses pheromones to control microscopic roundworms called nematodes. Dr. Kaplan discovered the first C. elegans sex pheromones which she published in Nature (2008). Then she found that other nematodes, including beneficial nematodes, use pheromones for other behaviors (PLoS 1, 2012). Karl Schiller is a seasoned entrepreneur with a background in Economics. Pheronym is his second start-up. Dr. David Shapiro-Ilan is a research scientist at the USDA. His research focuses on using beneficial nematodes for sustainable pest control.  
“The mission to space will offer a novel perspective and provide new insights into nematode behavior; the unique microgravity environment will allow us to explore fundamental mechanisms in parasitism and pathogenesis”, said Dr. Shapiro-Ilan.
Your IndieGoGo contributions will support this incredibly important research in space and on Earth.​
Mission Objectives
The AstroNematode experiment will test the effects of microgravity on the movement and infection behavior of beneficial nematodes that control a wide array of insect pests in agriculture. 

To test whether beneficial nematodes produce the same pheromone composition in microgravity vs. on Earth
To test whether beneficial nematodes grown in microgravity have the same symbiotic bacteria as their parents on Earth
To determine whether beneficial nematodes can emerge from infected cadavers in microgravity
To determine whether beneficial nematodes can disperse and forage for new insects after emergence
To determine whether beneficial nematodes can infect insect hosts in microgravity
To determine how microgravity affects insect host physiology

We will find out if beneficial nematodes are able to navigate through soil and infect insects, can reproduce, and if their symbiotic bacteria function normally in microgravity. We will also ascertain if the impact on insect host physiology is the same compared with what is observed on earth.
To address these questions, sealed soil columns containing nematodes and a model target pest (waxworms, Galleria mellonella) will be sent into space for 30 days. We will assess the results once the nematodes return to earth. We will conduct concurrent control experiments on Earth.
“We are looking to duplicate in space the success of our earth-bound commercialization trials of our nematode focused bio-remediation,” said Dr. Fatma Kaplan, CEO of Pheronym and the nematode space mission project director. Pheronym is an established cooperative research partner with USDA-ARS.

<h3>                                Does it really work?</h3>
<p>Ultrasonic cleaning has been successfully used in industry and medical practices for years. Materials that require thorough but delicate cleaning, such as dental and surgical instruments, lenses, jewelry, watches and much more, trust only the ultrasonic touch. In industry, ultrasonic technology is applied to remove oil and grease from motors and other automotive parts. For years, ultrasonic cleaning has continuously proven to be highly effective and efficient.</p>

<h3>                  Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Help! What if I forgot to pay for shipping?</strong></p>
<p>No problem. If you're outside the US and forgot to pay your shipping, simply order the International Shipping perk. Just make sure to enter the same personal information you provided with your initial order. We will do the matching ourselves at the end of the campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Am I supposed to manually add shipping if I'm not in the US?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you have to add shipping on top of your selected perk. When you pledge, add the shipping amount indicated in your perk as an ""additional gift"" or simply order the International Shipping perk with the same personal information.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>How much laundry can I wash in one load?</b></p>
<p>We recommend washing about 1-2kg of laundry. It should float freely in the water during the washing cycle.</p>
</div><div style=""text-align: left;"">
<h4> </h4>
<b>Have you tested it, will it really work?</b><br/> <p>It does sound a little like magic… Ultrasonic cleaning has been around for decades already and it's successfully applied for cleaning of wide range of items from surgical instruments up to watches, jewelry and automotive parts. The engineers from <a href=""http://www.mpi-ultrasonics.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MPI Ultrasonics </a>applied their over 25 years of experience in order to come up with Dolfi's technological solution for textiles. For many months they were developing, testing, and improving the performance of device until our lab prototype achieved the desired results. Our latest units demonstrate impressive performances in the laboratory tests.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>I am concerned about putting a plug-in device in the water… Isn’t that dangerous?</b></p>
<p>Not more dangerous than jumping into a swimming pool, nicely lightened with high voltage bulbs. Dolfi is developed in compliance with highest international standards on electric devices operating in water. We will certify Dolfi in accordance to region specific safety requirements: UL for US and Canada; CE for Europe; PSE for Japan; CCC for China etc. We’ll also complete <span>an IPX68 (water submersion) test for Dolfi before shipping it to customers.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Can Dolfi replace my automatic washing machine?</b></p>
<p>No. Dolfi is not a full cycle washing machine, it does only the washing part. It will also not be effective for big loads of laundry and for voluminous pieces such as bed linen, towels, jeans etc. Dolfi will rather complement your washing machine to deal with small volumes of delicate items that require a sensitive wash and can be ruined in the machine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>How about the smell, will Dolfi refresh my clothes or just clean them?</b></p>
<p>The washing process with Dolfi efficiently removes dirt and odors. You clothes will be ultrafresh after ultrasonic cleaning.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Do I need a detergent to wash with Dolfi?</b></p>
<p>Yes, you do. Over the last decades there were several attempts to develop ultrasonic washers which work without the detergent, but with Dolfi we didn't take this path. It might be the next challenge for our engineers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What kind of detergent is recommended to wash with Dolfi?</b></p>You can use any type of washing detergent available on the market. It doesn't matter if it's a liquid or powder. The better the quality of detergent, the better the results of washing.<p> </p>
<p><b>What's about rinsing and drying?</b></p>
<p>Dolfi performs only the washing part, you'll have to rinse and dry manually. Careful approach to drying also prolongs the life of your delicates. Your silk, lingerie, and knits will surely look much better if you carefully hang them, rather than heat <span>them up with the hot air in the dryer.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>I don’t mind doing hand wash. What can Dolfi do for me?</b></p>
<p>Dolfi has no mechanical impact on your washing. Rubbing your clothes between your hands can damage the structure or even rip the fabric. If you wash with Dolfi, your clothing will not wear out  during the washing process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Can I use it with 110V or is it 220V only?</b></p>
<p>Dolfi was designed for travelers. You can use it with any power supply from around the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Will it discolor my clothes?</b></p>
<p>No. Dolfi preserves your clothes’ color. Just make sure not to use color aggressive detergent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What else do I need to make Dolfi work?</b></p>
<p>You only need a waterproof container (or even a plastic bag), a small amount of detergent, a power source, and of course, your Dolfi device.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What is the difference between Dolfi and a washing machine in regards to the quality of washing?</b></p>
<p>Dolfi cleans your clothes gently, rather than banging them against the drum walls. The microscopic cavitation bubbles are also capable of reaching micro capillary fibers of fabric which is impossible to do with washing machines. The washing results are about the same, but Dolfi treats your clothing much more carefully.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>What is ultrasonic technology?</b></p>
<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasound"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ultrasound</a> is an oscillating <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">sound</a> pressure wave with a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">frequency</a> greater than the limits of human <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_range"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hearing range</a>. But even though we can't hear it, those sound waves are very powerful, think of dolphins communicating with one another from miles away. Specific frequency ultrasound waves in the water trigger a process called, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavitation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">cavitation</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Does ultrasonic cleaning work for textiles?</b></p>
<p>Ultrasonic technology is widely used for precise cleaning in industry and medicine – watches, jewelry, surgical instruments, medical implants, automotive parts and much more. High frequency waves perform superbly on hard materials and complete the cleaning process with remarkable results within just few minutes . But it's a difference for textile and other soft materials. In order to achieve good cleaning results on textiles, the wave frequency has to be modulated differently and the cleaning time extended. However, despite the challenges, ultrasonic cleaning for textile has been applied with standard size washing machines by companies such <a href=""http://www.designnews.com/document.asp?doc_id=213503&amp;dfpPParams=industry_consumer,aid_213503&amp;dfpLayout=article"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sanyo and Sharp</a> more than a decade ago. Another kind of ultrasonic textile cleaning has been developed for industrial applications by the German company, <a href=""http://www.sonotronic.de/technologies/ultrasonic/ultrasonic-washing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sonotronic</a>. The recent <a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1350417712002209"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">scientific research</a> from Japan proves the efficiency of ultrasound cleaning on textiles.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Plate Technologies is a team of four undergraduate students at the University of Rochester who are competing in the Hult Prize, the world’s largest social entrepreneurship challenge for college students. Our team is made up of Dilshawn Gamage, Annamarie Forestiere, Nicholas Cheng, and Chase Lindemann; together we will be traveling to Dubai in March to compete in the regional level of the Hult Prize, for a chance to win one million dollars to fund our business and help us change the lives of people around the world. Our mission is to create cleaner and safer alternatives to open-flame cooking, a practice that kills millions each year. With help from contributors like you, we hope to be well prepared for this stage in the competition next month.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Our team needs funding to cover conference expenses and to help us develop as much of our social enterprise as possible before the competition. We are asking for $4,250, and we believe that if we can reach our goal, we stand a great chance of advancing to the semi-finals. The funding received from our contributors will go toward conference expenses, such as lodging in Dubai; it will also go toward business expenses, such as the development of a prototype of our product and marketing and promotional costs. As the first place team representing the University of Rochester in this level of the Hult Prize, we want to make our University, contributors, family members, advisers, and friends. proud - we need your help to make that happen!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If we reach our funding goal, we will be able to develop a product and a business that will change the way people around the world view cooking. We hope to create a safer alternative to current cooking methods, which will prevent deaths due to smoke inhalation caused by open flame cooking. The Hult Prize provides Plate Technologies with an excellent platform to receive the support and guidance we need to turn our idea into reality, and with the help of contributors like you, our team can make the most of this incredible opportunity in March.We have already made it this far - you can help us go even further.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our team knows that this competition is a big risk in and of itself; we will be competing against 60 teams, and only one team from Dubai will advance to the semi-finals. That’s why we need your help! If we are able to develop a working prototype before the competition, we will be an extremely competitive team, and have a good chance of being that top team. The four of us also realize that starting a business is a huge risk. To combat that risk, we are working with some of the best entrepreneurial minds that the University of Rochester has to offer. By receiving guidance from our advisers, and with the help we hope to receive from people like you, we are confident in our ability to make our idea work.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can’t financially contribute, we would still love your help! If you know any entrepreneurs who have successfully started a business, or if you yourself have done so, we are always looking for advice that can help us start our enterprise. You can also share this link on your social media page - the more people who know what we are trying to do, the more likely we are to reach our goals!</p>

I fell into a daydream on that day as the  weather was extremely hot while my teacher taught about sustainable energy. A key sentence went through my ears while I was still daydreaming. “ You can harvest tree branches and sticks from your backyard for firewood fuel without logging whole trees down”</p><p>“ Wow, what a wonderful idea, I never thought about that, but what was that?” “Can’t hear very clear... just heard something.....Stove,” the voice talked to me in my daydream.</p><p>As time went by, in recent years, our family moved into a newly built house with a central heating system and we have only used it for a couple of weeks. By this time, the gas meter has already shown the cost of the next gas bill will be around two thousand dollars according to our gas usage.</p><p>After that, we started to think of installing a new wood heater but none of the wood heaters on the market satisfied our inquiries.</p><p>I started to check my Permaculture Design Course Manual. Something about stoves not needing to cut entire trees down for firewood, just gather twigs or sticks? Finally I found that these are called “Rocket Stoves.”</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://imgur.com/0JGgSFH.gif"" src="""" style=""float:left;width:50%;margin-right:5px;""/></p><p>It was very exciting and I read it again and again, searching the internet day and night.</p><p>I found out it could not fit in my house because a rocket stove is mainly used for cooking not for heating and a rocket mass heater is only built on building sites, it can not be produced in a factory meaning we could not buy one from stores or the online market.</p><p> </p><p>I still liked that idea. <strong>“Not needing to cut entire trees down, you can harvest tree branches year after year.”</strong></p><p>Where can I get similar products? One day I drove to my friend's place and an idea sprouted from my mind. “Yes,” it can be designed that way.</p><p>I decided to invite two friends of mine to join my research in how a wood heater works and produce an invention for highly efficient wood combustion in a heater. Finally, we managed to invent a prototype of our Rocket Math Heater.</p><p><strong>Daydreaming</strong> is a Sign of Intelligence, New Studies Say.</p><p> </p><h2><strong>Rocket Math Heater</strong></h2><h3><span style=""font-weight:=;"">The biggest innovation in the wood heater in 200 years</span></h3><div>
<div><span style=""font-weight:=;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1547698022/k5st8iwvv87pnyxb17jl.jpg"" src=""""/></span></div>
<p><span style=""font-weight:=;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight:=;""><strong>Rocket Math Heater</strong> relates generally to an improved wood combustion heater. The method of wood combustion has been changed and is more efficient and sustainable.</span></p>
</div><p><span style=""font-weight:=;"">A Rocket Math Heater offers almost the complete combustion of the wood. When wood is burned it releases volatile gases that we recognise as creosote or smoke and the Rocket Math Heater sucks these volatile gases into combustion tunnels and a combustion firebox of the unit where they combust. This action is known as the secondary combustion and it releases even more heat energy to power the ‘rocket’ process.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight:=;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://imgur.com/5VzIzna.gif"" src="""" style=""float:left;width:50%;margin-right:5px;""/></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight:=;"">The remarkable sucking of the flames down into the firebox resulting in a 'roar' is what gives the rocket stoves their name. </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight:=;""><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>The Rocket Math Heater combustion system is very cheap to run. The combustion area only burns the bottom of the feed tubes and as the wood burns vertically, only a small portion of wood is burnt at a time. They offer the almost complete combustion of wood, meaning they are hyper-efficient and burn super-clean and they can reach very high temperatures while only using small and medium diameters of timber. There would be no need to cut whole trees down, we could just harvest tree branches year after year. This way, we can save millions, potentially billions of trees.</span></span></p><div><span style=""font-weight:=;""> </span></div><p><span style=""font-weight:=;""> </span></p><h3><span style=""font-weight:=;""><b>Rocket Math Heater vs Conventional Heater</b></span></h3><p><span style=""font-weight:=;"">The main difference between a normal wood heater and a Rocket Math Heater is that the rocket combustion is close to complete. When wood is burned it releases volatile compounds that we recognise as smoke, soot or creosote. In a Rocket Math Heater these compounds are sucked into combustion tunnels and a combustion firebox of the unit where they combust, releasing even more heat energy to drive the ‘rocket’ process, unlike a normal wood heater where they are blown out of the chimney.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight:=;"">Rocket Math Heaters are improved by an operable auxiliary combustion chamber coupled to the main combustion chamber. The auxiliary combustion may further comprise an air supply conduit supplying air beneath the fuel chute, allowing lots of oxygen to be drawn into the unit. As the fire starts, and the burn tunnel heats up, the rising hot air races up the combustion chamber, drawing lots of air behind it. This incoming air flows into the feed tube and across the burning wood, creating the same effect as pointing a big air-blower at your fire. It gets really hot while the wood burns beautifully, and you can hear the air roaring as it charges through the system.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight:=;"">In conventional wood stoves the air intake is small and adjustable to make them even smaller. This lack of oxygen chokes the combustion, leading to cool burns, incomplete combustion and lots of smoke and creosote. When combustion is complete, what comes out the chimney is pretty much only carbon dioxide, meaning no smoke: smoke means incomplete combustion, unburnt fuel or wasted energy. We are culturally trained to associate smoke with fire but with Rocket Math Heaters, where there is no smoke, there is still fire!</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight:=;"">Having ensured there is complete combustion and maximum heat generation, we then think about using wood heaters.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight:=;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://imgur.com/ti7t2r8.gif"" src="""" style=""float: right;width:50%;margin-left:5px;""/></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight:=;"">Conventional wood heaters suck heat away from the combustion chamber for cooking and space heating but with ‘wet back’ water heaters, the unit just can’t get hot enough for combustion to be complete, resulting in lots of smoke.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight:=;"">That is how a Rocket Math Heater differs from normal wood heater.</span></p><p><span style=""font-weight:=;""> *The picture show smoke from a conventional wood heater.</span></p><h3><span style=""font-weight:=;""><b>Rocket Math Heater vs Rocket stove and Rocket mass heater</b></span></h3><p><span style=""font-weight:=;"">The Rocket Math Heater is different from Rocket stoves and Rocket mass heaters because Rocket stoves are too small to heat a large space and Rocket mass heaters can heat large spaces but can not be manufactured and has to be built on a building site. The Rocket Math heater is able to be manufactured and also able to heat a large space.

I fell into a daydream on that day as the  weather was extremely hot while my teacher taught about sustainable energy. A key sentence went through my ears while I was still daydreaming. “ You can harvest tree branches and sticks from your backyard for firewood fuel without logging whole trees down”“ Wow, what a wonderful idea, I never thought about that, but what was that?” “Can’t hear very clear... just heard something.....Stove,” the voice talked to me in my daydream.As time went by, in recent years, our family moved into a newly built house with a central heating system and we have only used it for a couple of weeks. By this time, the gas meter has already shown the cost of the next gas bill will be around two thousand dollars according to our gas usage.After that, we started to think of installing a new wood heater but none of the wood heaters on the market satisfied our inquiries.I started to check my Permaculture Design Course Manual. Something about stoves not needing to cut entire trees down for firewood, just gather twigs or sticks? Finally I found that these are called “Rocket Stoves.”It was very exciting and I read it again and again, searching the internet day and night.I found out it could not fit in my house because a rocket stove is mainly used for cooking not for heating and a rocket mass heater is only built on building sites, it can not be produced in a factory meaning we could not buy one from stores or the online market. I still liked that idea. “Not needing to cut entire trees down, you can harvest tree branches year after year.”Where can I get similar products? One day I drove to my friend's place and an idea sprouted from my mind. “Yes,” it can be designed that way.I decided to invite two friends of mine to join my research in how a wood heater works and produce an invention for highly efficient wood combustion in a heater. Finally, we managed to invent a prototype of our Rocket Math Heater.Daydreaming is a Sign of Intelligence, New Studies Say. Rocket Math HeaterThe biggest innovation in the wood heater in 200 years

 
Rocket Math Heater relates generally to an improved wood combustion heater. The method of wood combustion has been changed and is more efficient and sustainable.
A Rocket Math Heater offers almost the complete combustion of the wood. When wood is burned it releases volatile gases that we recognise as creosote or smoke and the Rocket Math Heater sucks these volatile gases into combustion tunnels and a combustion firebox of the unit where they combust. This action is known as the secondary combustion and it releases even more heat energy to power the ‘rocket’ process.The remarkable sucking of the flames down into the firebox resulting in a 'roar' is what gives the rocket stoves their name. The Rocket Math Heater combustion system is very cheap to run. The combustion area only burns the bottom of the feed tubes and as the wood burns vertically, only a small portion of wood is burnt at a time. They offer the almost complete combustion of wood, meaning they are hyper-efficient and burn super-clean and they can reach very high temperatures while only using small and medium diameters of timber. There would be no need to cut whole trees down, we could just harvest tree branches year after year. This way, we can save millions, potentially billions of trees.  Rocket Math Heater vs Conventional HeaterThe main difference between a normal wood heater and a Rocket Math Heater is that the rocket combustion is close to complete. When wood is burned it releases volatile compounds that we recognise as smoke, soot or creosote. In a Rocket Math Heater these compounds are sucked into combustion tunnels and a combustion firebox of the unit where they combust, releasing even more heat energy to drive the ‘rocket’ process, unlike a normal wood heater where they are blown out of the chimney.Rocket Math Heaters are improved by an operable auxiliary combustion chamber coupled to the main combustion chamber. The auxiliary combustion may further comprise an air supply conduit supplying air beneath the fuel chute, allowing lots of oxygen to be drawn into the unit. As the fire starts, and the burn tunnel heats up, the rising hot air races up the combustion chamber, drawing lots of air behind it. This incoming air flows into the feed tube and across the burning wood, creating the same effect as pointing a big air-blower at your fire. It gets really hot while the wood burns beautifully, and you can hear the air roaring as it charges through the system.In conventional wood stoves the air intake is small and adjustable to make them even smaller. This lack of oxygen chokes the combustion, leading to cool burns, incomplete combustion and lots of smoke and creosote. When combustion is complete, what comes out the chimney is pretty much only carbon dioxide, meaning no smoke: smoke means incomplete combustion, unburnt fuel or wasted energy. We are culturally trained to associate smoke with fire but with Rocket Math Heaters, where there is no smoke, there is still fire!Having ensured there is complete combustion and maximum heat generation, we then think about using wood heaters.Conventional wood heaters suck heat away from the combustion chamber for cooking and space heating but with ‘wet back’ water heaters, the unit just can’t get hot enough for combustion to be complete, resulting in lots of smoke.That is how a Rocket Math Heater differs from normal wood heater. *The picture show smoke from a conventional wood heater.Rocket Math Heater vs Rocket stove and Rocket mass heaterThe Rocket Math Heater is different from Rocket stoves and Rocket mass heaters because Rocket stoves are too small to heat a large space and Rocket mass heaters can heat large spaces but can not be manufactured and has to be built on a building site. The Rocket Math heater is able to be manufactured and also able to heat a large space. The Rocket Math Heater is basically an all in one combustion system.You and me can help save billions of trees from the wood fuel plantations, but keep wood industry jobs because medium sizes of wood requires more labor to split but requires less cutting down of trees and trees to not be cut down. Costs of action and inaction, which is the smart way?The NSW EPA reported that the additional health costs attributable to the impact of wood smoke by 2030 could be up to $8 billion in NSW alone. In addition to the economic costs associated with wood smoke there are the impacts on individuals to consider. Costs of action and inaction, which is the smart way?We need action before it’s too late. The Rocket Math Heater offer complete combustion, what comes out the chimney is pretty much only steam, meaning no smoke. The story of a cockatoo can save billions of trees.A cockatoo tried to put out a bush fire with her wings by dampening them in the river. She flew ten thousand times in and out from the river to the fire, all day and night.Her heroic gesture touched one of the great angels from heaven.The angel came to the fire and asked her “How come you can put out the bush fire with just a few drops from your wings each time you carried from the river?“In this stage, this is the only way I can put out the fire, if you have a better way, please do it, or I will have to go before the fire takes over and it will be too late!” The cockatoo answered.The great angel was very satisfied and created a heavy rain that put out the fire.They saved hundreds and thousands of lives and billions of trees in that forest.     Planning for force majeure and contingent conditions. Every family should have at least one Rocket Math Heater in their house or keep one in a shed for emergency use in some circumstances, such as you can not get electricity, petrol and firewood logs somehow! Rocket Math Heater can still help you and your family survive during that force majeure and contingent conditions. ""We look after nature, she'll look after us, in this century we are beginning to realize that, in order to survive, we must protect it.

<p><strong>Accessible to all riders</strong></p>
<p>The weight makes it easy for beginners or first time riders to have fun with limited risks. The bike also features two ride modes : ECO, and Boost.</p>
<p>In ECO mode, the maximum power limited to about 3000W, making the bike very easy to control and safe for all riders. Flip it in Boost, and the full 8000W of electrical power is available for maximum performance.</p>
<p><strong>Street legal</strong></p>
<p>Ride safely and legally thanks to homologation, and be covered in case something happens on or off-road. Reach new trails and landscapes right from your home, and make your commute a lot more fun. For the US, the optional pedal attachment enables to use the bike as a motorized bicycle.</p>
<p><strong>High Performance</strong></p>
<p>The LMX 161 is a high performance motorcycle, with acceleration comparable to a 85cc offroad motorbike. With over 300 N.m at the back wheel available from zero RPM, the LMX 161-H really takes advantage of the electric drive train characteristics.</p>
<p>The linkage suspension provides a progressive leverage ratio, giving the bike good suspension performance for high speed bumps and rough landings.</p>
<p><strong>Quick swap battery</strong></p>
<p>Ride longer using multiple batteries, or bring your battery up to your apartment for charging.</p>

<p>Having a quick swap battery makes it easy to keep your LMX 161 charged. The 12 kg battery is released by a key lock and features a strap for easy handling. The light weight of the LMX 161 without the battery enables easy loading in your car or on a bike rack.</p>
<p><strong>Low maintenance</strong></p>
<p>The electric drive train and Igus® Iglidur® dry bearings makes the LMX 161 low maintenance and long lasting compared to other high performance off-road bikes.</p>
<p>The Samsung® 30Q cells used in our battery are rated 300 cycles to 75% of initial capacity at full power. This translates to about 750 hours of competition track time on a battery pack, and more than 40,000km of street use.</p>
<p>Thanks to forward planning in the bike's design and advances in battery capacity, the LMX 161-H battery will be upgradable in the future.</p>
<p>With electronic engine braking, the wear and tear on the brake pads during most braking situations, and about 5-10% energy can be regenerated.</p>

The product
With a weight of 42kg in homologated version, the LMX 161-H is half the weight of combustion bikes of similar performance such as 85cc cross bikes.

Developed in France for riders and by riders, the LMX 161-H is optimized for extreme off-road use.
 

 
Now we need your help to reach for the next big step: making it street legal.

With this campaign we will fund the certification of the bike to enable registration as a L1E-B (50CC) moped in Europe.
While the bike will not be street legal as a moped in the US when it ships, we will offer the option to have working pedals that makes the LMX 161 a motor assisted bicycle in most US states, with reduced power and top speed. You can also use your LMX 161 as an offroad motorbike, and still get your bike much cheaper than the regular price!

<h2>Trimatis - From Plastic Waste to 3D Space</h2>

<p><strong>There are a lot of awesome people in the world working on sustainable 3D printing methods. The problem is that most of them are recycling 3D printer plastic. That's great, but it doesn't go far enough.</strong></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: right;""><strong><font color=""#82c341"">_____________________________________</font></strong></h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: right;""><strong>What is 3D Printing Anyway?</strong></h2>
<p>You've probably heard people talk about 3D printing, but maybe you don't know what it is.  Here's a simple explanation:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533744281/zyyremncolfnlejzis7d.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>3D Printing is great technology, but<strong> it adds to the amount of plastic polluting our environment </strong>and also generates a lot of waste.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: right;""><strong><font color=""#82c341"">________________________________________</font></strong></h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: right;""><strong>Plastic Pollution</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Did you know that <strong>only 9% of plastic is recycled</strong>?  A National Geographic story found that <strong>91%</strong> of the plastic we create ends up as trash or litter. </p>
<p><strong>Even the bottles</strong> you put out to the curb every week end up as trash.  And a lot of it ends up in the ocean.  In fact, every minute, the equivalent of one garbage truck full of plastic is dumped into our oceans. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534009624/v3zalxakouy7gm346im5.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3>So the question is not only how we clean up our oceans, but how do we prevent plastic pollution in the first place?</h3>

</div></div>","Trimatis - From Plastic Waste to 3D Space
Since our conception in early 2018, Trimatis LLC, has become a  leader in creating sustainable 3D printing solutions.  With our 4 Phase strategy, we deliver cost effective innovation to schools and educators, while helping the environment one bottle at a time!

_____________________________________
 

 
There are a lot of awesome people in the world working on sustainable 3D printing methods. The problem is that most of them are recycling 3D printer plastic. That's great, but it doesn't go far enough.
_____________________________________
What is 3D Printing Anyway?
You've probably heard people talk about 3D printing, but maybe you don't know what it is.  Here's a simple explanation:

3D Printing is great technology, but it adds to the amount of plastic polluting our environment and also generates a lot of waste.
 
________________________________________
Plastic Pollution
 
Did you know that only 9% of plastic is recycled?  A National Geographic story found that 91% of the plastic we create ends up as trash or litter. 
Even the bottles you put out to the curb every week end up as trash.  And a lot of it ends up in the ocean.  In fact, every minute, the equivalent of one garbage truck full of plastic is dumped into our oceans. 

 
 
So the question is not only how we clean up our oceans, but how do we prevent plastic pollution in the first place?
 
That's where we come in!

 

______________________________________

 
 
Here at Trimatis, we've developed a patent-pending process to create 3D printer Eco-filament from your plastic bottles - that's right, we collect your plastic bottles and repurpose them.  We not only cut down on the amount of plastic in our oceans, but also reduce the amount of new plastic generated.
 

 
_____________________________________
Can we make an impact?
 
YES
Using our process, we can make a spool of filament from 80 plastic bottles.
 

 
 

 
____________________________________
You can make a difference!
 

 
 
 
____________________________________
​How You Can Help
 
Your generous donation will allow us to grow so we can provide a more sustainable way to 3D print to schools and universities, who are already using 3D printing in their curriculum.
Our dream is to not only help the environment, but empower a whole new generation to understand the importance of sustainability in everything they do.   
 
We will initially generate two revenue streams, consisting of the distribution of our Eco-Filament to schools and universities, with whom we've already established relationships, as well as the delivery of  educational workshops on 3D printing and sustainability.  
​
To keep up with demand, we'll need your help to scale up our operations.  Part of our costs have already been covered by utilizing the owners' equity.  We also are blessed to have incubator space allowing us to operate rent-free.​
 
  ​
 
____________________________________
Job Creation
 
As we scale-up our operations, we will hire a work-force from the local community to collect and sort plastic waste. 
As we expand our customer base, we'll create manufacturing jobs to ensure continued product quality and excellence in order fulfillment.

<h2>FIRST SKYDIVING SPEED RECORD IN THE JET STREAM<br/><br/>Promoting untapped wind energy on TV</h2>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>The jet stream is one of the most powerful energy sources of our planet, but most of us are not aware of this high-altitude wind power. How could we spread this information on a global scale?</p>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p>Create a world record skydiving mission in the jet stream, capture the story in an action packed documentary. As with other films Claudio has made, the programme will be broadcast on an international news channel such as BBC World News TV.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519233408/cyq61j4jinf6wzafppd6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>We will take off, but we need some extra cash to cover the documentary production budget and the balloon ride</h3>
<p>Our sponsors will help us make the exploration a reality.<br/>However, we are relying on crowdfunding support for the film production and potentially for the relocation to Australia if we can't jump in Switzerland before mid-March 2018.</p>
<h3>
<br/>The adventure in a nutshell</h3>
<ul>
<li>Goal: Flying forward in freefall as fast as possible by using the jet stream as a tailwind!<br/>Raise awareness about the untapped clean energy potential of the jet stream.</li>
<li>Stunt: First human flight (skydive) inside the jet stream.</li>
<li>Skydiving Suit: No wingsuit, just a normal skydiving suit.</li>
<li>Skydiver: World Record Holder Marc Hauser</li>
<li>Aircraft: Hot air balloon</li>
<li>Altitude: approx. 34,000ft / 10'000m above sea level</li>
<li>Temperature: -50° Celsius/ -58 °F</li>
<li>Wind speed: +80kn | +150 km/h (hopefully even faster)</li>
<li>Expected forward ground speed: +200 m/ph | +320 km/h </li>
<li>Place: Switzerland or Australia (after mid-March)</li>
<li>Date: This winter/springtime 2018</li>
<li>International media partners</li>

<h3><strong>MEDIAPARTNERS</strong></h3>

<h3>
<br/>Why we need your support?</h3>
<p>Your support will help us to take off and jump and produce an awe inspiring film that will be seen around the world on some of the most prestigious channels available.</p>
<h3>
<br/>What we need</h3>
<p>Budget positions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skydiving training in Spain: travel, accommodation, car rentals etc.</li>
<li>Hot air balloon training and jumps</li>
<li>Risk Insurances</li>
<li>Special Equipment: cameras, thermal protection, clothing</li>
<li>Additional crew for the film production: extra cameramen, editors, graphic designers</li>
</ul>
<p>Most likely this crowdfunding campaign will not close the holes in our pockets but it will allow us to produce a better documentary and this will be essential to inspire a global audience.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Film and event production budget</h3>
<p>A broadcast quality documentary shot on various international locations typically costs $4.000 USD per minute. BBC World News TV has expressed an interest in acquiring our film as 3 x 22 minute programmes. That's a production budget of $264.000 USD. But first we have to finance the production on our own.</p>
<p>Fortunately a highly experienced freelancer like Claudio can survive on a smaller budget because he is used to film, direct and edit on his own. However, at rock bottom Claudio will still need about $40.000 USD to cover a minimal fee and his expenses for equipment, travel and accommodation. In addition he will have to hire some extra crew and equipment for a multi-camera shoot to capture the finale of Marc's record jump. </p>
<p>Claudio will also have to hire experts to polish the post-production of the film because professional colour grading, music and sound-design will be essential for a broadcast quality film. These indispensable cost for extra manpower will add another $10.000 USD to our budget.  </p>
<ul>
<li>For the film production we are aiming to raise $50.000 USD</li>
<li>If we can't jump in Switzerland we will need an additional $30.000 USD for expenses to relocate our event to Australia.</li>
<li>We are looking at a total of $80.000 USD</li>
</ul>

<h3>The risks</h3>
<p>Skydiving can be dangerous.<br/>But skydiving from above 30.000 feet is even more risky.<br/><br/>We have to deal with</p>
<ul>
<li>low density air and oxygene levels - danger of hypoxia</li>
<li>temperatures below -50° Celsius/ -58 °F</li>
<li>commercial and military airplanes at these flight levels</li>
<li>and heavy winds - that's what we are looking for</li>
</ul>

<p>Scary moments before exit</p>
<h3>
<br/>The solution</h3>
<p>Training and preparation is everything.<br/>We established a team with the best experts in aviation.<br/>From N°1 ranked hot air balloon pilots to riggers, oxygen specialists, military doctors, and freefly camera men. But the adventure still remains dangerous.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519288273/xctulzb81tqmgexftyow.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Why we will be the game changers?</h3>
<p>It all comes down to mass when you want to accelerate in freefall.<br/>That's why I had to gain weight. By the way, that was one of the best parts of the adventure.<br/>Now with my giant size of <strong>200cm/ 6'7'' and my 110kg/ 242 lbs</strong> I am a living cannonball.<br/>I am by far not the best skydiver. But my body makes me pretty fast.<br/>As a good skydiver you could try to catch me in freefall. But it could be physically impossible.</p>
<p>With 20 years of experience as a glider pilot and single engine pilot I have a good understanding of aerodynamics. And my Swiss bullhead gives me the mental power and will to succeed.</p>

<h3>
<br/>We will takeoff anyway - so why should you contribute?</h3>
<p>Since we are already on stand by for takeoff you may think:<br/>""Let them do their job and I will enjoy the show.""</p>
<p>No, we would miss a crucial trick.</p>
<p>To capitalise fully on the broadcast opportunity with BBC World News and win maximum global attention we need to complete and release our documentary as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Speed is everything like for Marc in the jet stream. We will have to hire extra man power to finish our post-production with tight deadlines . Your crowdfunding support will  make that possible.</p>
<h3>Where do we take off and land?</h3>
<p>Until mid-March we can start and land in Europe. We plan to take off in Germany, the jet stream will bring us over Switzerland, where I will land with my parachute. And the balloon will fly to Italy and land in the region of Milano.<br/> </p>
<h3>Plan B is Australia</h3>
<p>Form mid March onwards the thermal winds will be too strong for a balloon flight in Europe during daytime. Then we would have to re-locate to Australia. This option would give us some nice new opportunities... but as well some extra expenses, for sure.<br/>The fundraising for the <strong>Australian Plan B Budget of 20k</strong> could become our second goal after mid March.<br/> </p>

The Challenge
The jet stream is one of the most powerful energy sources of our planet, but most of us are not aware of this high-altitude wind power. How could we spread this information on a global scale?
The Solution
Create a world record skydiving mission in the jet stream, capture the story in an action packed documentary. As with other films Claudio has made, the programme will be broadcast on an international news channel such as BBC World News TV.

We will take off, but we need some extra cash to cover the documentary production budget and the balloon ride
Our sponsors will help us make the exploration a reality.However, we are relying on crowdfunding support for the film production and potentially for the relocation to Australia if we can't jump in Switzerland before mid-March 2018.

The adventure in a nutshell

Goal: Flying forward in freefall as fast as possible by using the jet stream as a tailwind!Raise awareness about the untapped clean energy potential of the jet stream.
Stunt: First human flight (skydive) inside the jet stream.
Skydiving Suit: No wingsuit, just a normal skydiving suit.
Skydiver: World Record Holder Marc Hauser
Aircraft: Hot air balloon
Altitude: approx. 34,000ft / 10'000m above sea level
Temperature: -50° Celsius/ -58 °F
Wind speed: +80kn | +150 km/h (hopefully even faster)
Expected forward ground speed: +200 m/ph | +320 km/h 
Place: Switzerland or Australia (after mid-March)
Date: This winter/springtime 2018

My dream - flying the jet stream
Marc Hauser, born 1971, lives in Bern, Switzerland and has two adult daughters.Marc is an entrepreneur, an adventurer and a skydiving pioneer. In 2012 he created the Speed-Tracking discipline and reached a horizontal speed of 304 km/h, 188 mph without tail wind. This is still an unbroken world record in forward speed for a skydiver without wingsuit. 

First World Record by Marc Hauser 2012 over Empuriabrava, Spain: 304 km/h | 188mp/h
As JET STREAM SUPERMAN Marc is now looking for the strongest possible tailwind in the jet stream to beat his own 2012 record and explore the energy potential of high-altitude wind-power.



Documentary filmmaker Claudio von Planta
Claudio von Planta is a star himself. He filmed Star Wars actor Ewan McGregor and Charley Boorman on motorcycle journeys around the world and across Africa. Claudio was the third guy on the bike in Long Way Round and Long Way Down.  Now he will produce a documentary about Jet Stream Superman, which we are confident will be broadcast on an international TV channel, such as BBC World News.Ewan McGregor | Claudio von Planta | Charley Boorman

MEDIAPARTNERS
We will be looking to licence the documentary to a number of TV channels, among them BBC World News, which has shown an interest in this story and where Claudio has been honoured to have his films shown previously.
 
KEYSTONE Agency
They started to cover the preparations in Switzerland and will provide agency news about Marc's record jump to many media organisations in Europe.

Why we need your support?
Your support will help us to take off and jump and produce an awe inspiring film that will be seen around the world on some of the most prestigious channels available.

What we need
Budget positions:

Skydiving training in Spain: travel, accommodation, car rentals etc.
Hot air balloon training and jumps
Risk Insurances
Special Equipment: cameras, thermal protection, clothing
Additional crew for the film production: extra cameramen, editors, graphic designers

Most likely this crowdfunding campaign will not close the holes in our pockets but it will allow us to produce a better documentary and this will be essential to inspire a global audience.

Film and event production budget
A broadcast quality documentary shot on various international locations typically costs $4.000 USD per minute. BBC World News TV has expressed an interest in acquiring our film as 3 x 22 minute programmes. That's a production budget of $264.000 USD. But first we have to finance the production on our own.
Fortunately a highly experienced freelancer like Claudio can survive on a smaller budget because he is used to film, direct and edit on his own. However, at rock bottom Claudio will still need about $40.000 USD to cover a minimal fee and his expenses for equipment, travel and accommodation. In addition he will have to hire some extra crew and equipment for a multi-camera shoot to capture the finale of Marc's record jump. 
Claudio will also have to hire experts to polish the post-production of the film because professional colour grading, music and sound-design will be essential for a broadcast quality film. These indispensable cost for extra manpower will add another $10.000 USD to our budget.  

For the film production we are aiming to raise $50.000 USD
If we can't jump in Switzerland we will need an additional $30.000 USD for expenses to relocate our event to Australia.
We are looking at a total of $80.000 USD

The energy background of the jet stream
High-altitude wind power could be the answer to our energy problems.Just a small part of the jet stream power could make the job.There are innovative companies like TWINGTEC involved in this new business field.They do not reach jet stream altitude yet. But it's a first step towards a brighter future.


 

For our documentary we also visited the Weathermuseum near Berlin, Germany. They still hold the high altitude world record for kites at jet stream levels of 31.955ft | 9740m. The record was set in 1919. Imagine: This world record kite reached jet stream altitude!In 2016 Bill Gates mentioned the jet stream as one of the ""energy miracles"" of the future.
 
The meteorology of the jet stream
The jet stream over Switzerland can be really strong.What we need is a combination of good weather on the ground, not too much clouds in the air and fair winds at 34.000 ft/ 10'000m above sea level. Sounds like a piece of cake? It's not.
 Our meteorologist Dr. Ralph Rickli, a highly experienced expedition weather forecaster.

At Windy.com you can check the jet stream at your place in realtime. 

The risks
Skydiving can be dangerous.But skydiving from above 30.000 feet is even more risky.We have to deal with

low density air and oxygene levels - danger of hypoxia
temperatures below -50° Celsius/ -58 °F
commercial and military airplanes at these flight levels
and heavy winds - that's what we are looking for


Scary moments before exit

The solution
Training and preparation is everything.We established a team with the best experts in aviation.From N°1 ranked hot air balloon pilots to riggers, oxygen specialists, military doctors, and freefly camera men. But the adventure still remains dangerous.

Why we will be the game changers?
It all comes down to mass when you want to accelerate in freefall.That's why I had to gain weight. By the way, that was one of the best parts of the adventure.Now with my giant size of 200cm/ 6'7'' and my 110kg/ 242 lbs I am a living cannonball.I am by far not the best skydiver. But my body makes me pretty fast.As a good skydiver you could try to catch me in freefall. But it could be physically impossible.
With 20 years of experience as a glider pilot and single engine pilot I have a good understanding of aerodynamics. And my Swiss bullhead gives me the mental power and will to succeed.

We will takeoff anyway - so why should you contribute?
Since we are already on stand by for takeoff you may think:""Let them do their job and I will enjoy the show.""
No, we would miss a crucial trick.
To capitalise fully on the broadcast opportunity with BBC World News and win maximum global attention we need to complete and release our documentary as soon as possible.
Speed is everything like for Marc in the jet stream. We will have to hire extra man power to finish our post-production with tight deadlines . Your crowdfunding support will  make that possible.
Where do we take off and land?
Until mid-March we can start and land in Europe. We plan to take off in Germany, the jet stream will bring us over Switzerland, where I will land with my parachute. And the balloon will fly to Italy and land in the region of Milano. 
Plan B is Australia
Form mid March onwards the thermal winds will be too strong for a balloon flight in Europe during daytime. Then we would have to re-locate to Australia. This option would give us some nice new opportunities... but as well some extra expenses, for sure.The fundraising for the Australian Plan B Budget of 20k could become our second goal after mid March.

After the successful jump: Spreading the word!
As an adventurer I am on stages as a keynote speaker on a regular basis. - Not so much during the last months of the training. This will change after completing our mission in the sky!I am already looking forward to spread the word about our fascinating clean energy project.

The post production of the documentary after the jump would take ages.The reason for that: we could not hire additional post-production experts to support Claudio.
We could not afford 3D-graphics and smart animations to illustrate the complexity of this clean energy phenomenon and the technology background of the jump

<b></b><p><br/></p>What is Vortex?


</div>
<div>
<p>Vortex is a wind generator without blades. Instead of capturing energy via the rotational motion of a turbine, the Vortex takes advantage of what’s known as vorticity, an aerodynamic effect that occurs when wind breaks against a solid structure (Kármán vortex street). The Vortex structure starts to oscillate, and captures the energy that is produced.<br/></p>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433109007/o2d3vyf3owqcozbomzhz.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Vortex doesn’t just eliminate the blades. We have deliberately designed it to have no parts in contact at all (no gears, linkages, etc). This way we can make Vortex <b>cheap and easy </b>to maintain. </p>
<p>Basically, we reduce the amount of raw materials used for manufacturing, which cuts the production costs and time to produce the equipment. Further, having no moving parts in contact means that there are really very few things that can break, which extends time between maintenance intervals and allows to have less down time. As a result, maintaining costs are low. </p>
<p>Finally, Vortex is <b>silent</b>, since itoscillates at a frequency that doesn't produce audible noise (it is below 20 Hz) . It is also <b>safer for birds</b> that often suffer from collision with blades.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""></p>
<p><b>What are the benefits?</b></p>
<p><b>Cost</b></p>
<p>One of the main advantages of VORTEX is its dramatic low cost - it will produce energy at a 40% lower cost than a comparable wind installation. The normalized cost of energy generation ( LCOE ) for a typical onshore facility will be $ 0.035 / kWh (about 35 Euros / MWh ), including capital costs, operation and maintenance, performance, land leases, insurance and other administrative expenses.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432917406/qsihxzbdy9atjptzduix.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 507.157464212679px; height: 400px;""/><br/></p>
<p>This will put the technology at the very low range of capital intensity for such projects, it also will make it highly competitive not only against generations of alternative or renewable energy, but even compared to conventional technologies, as shown in the graph.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432661730/gia7yxw1j4r8lhdn3miv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Breakdown of the cost savings</b></p>
<p>Cost reduction stems from reduced manufacturing costs: Vortex integrates the tower and generator into one structure, requiring less moving parts and less material to produce the same amount of electricity. Is also eliminates the nacelle, the support mechanisms and the blades that are the priciest components in a conventional wind generator. Manufacturing savings are roughly estimated at around 53 % of the usual wind turbine production cost. The manufacturing, transportation, construction and assembly will be also simplified and are typical for the wind industry.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432916967/zozfcjvvebrqhvjrarqg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>The design completely eliminates mechanical elements that can suffer wear and tear from friction, leading to an estimated 80 % reduction in maintenance costs. We achieve this because there's no need to change any mechanical parts or add oil to the structure during it's life cycle.</p>
<p>Of course, it won’t be immune to fatigue. The wind can cause twisting and displacement of the structure, primarily in the elastic rod, especially in the lower section that has to withstand greater forces. However, studies carried out by the company confirm that, the stress on the rod is far from the  working limit of the materials, i.e. carbon fiber. Computational modeling estimates operational lifetime of the installation to be between 32 and 96 years .</p>
</div>
<div>There is another differentiating factor is that it's very easy to assemble and maintain, because<span style=""background-color: initial;""> the alternator (and the center of gravity) is close to the ground. This also means, we need less foundation.</span>
</div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432917016/le5o4hmzqqscomkkaida.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>The radius of oscillation is equal to the diameter of the installation at its top end (also its widest part). Vortex needs to be higher to sweep the same area. It can capture about 40% of the wind power contained in the air, the theoretical maximum you can achieve is 59% (the Betz's law).</p>
<p>We can put more Vortex in the same area at a lower cost and produce more electricity. The cost and density of installation compensates for a lower efficiency of energy conversion (30% less).</p>

<b><b>Vortex Products</b></b><p>Within the next 12 months we will have the first products for small-scale and residential use. The 100 W and 4 kW Vortex' work for private homes in developing countries, or small constructions like radio antennas. It can also work both connected to the grid or off-grid. Moreover, this Vortex would work perfectly in combination with solar panels. The final step is to build our dream 1 MW Vortex by 2018.</p>

<p><b>The Origin of Vortex Bladeless</b></p>
<p>One day, David Yáñez questioned the way the wind energy is generated. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">He found another promising way to generate energy from wind. </span><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The idea was born.</b></p>
<p>Months later, David shared his idea with his business partner Raúl Martín, and he became the first person to believe in the idea. <b>The dream was born.</b></p>
<p>But the dream team wasn't complete. This happened when David Suriol joined the team. There was, probably, a 3% chance of success, but we believed in it and went to work! <b>The project was born.</b></p>
<p>It all started back in 2002, when David first saw a video of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge swaying and oscillating in wind. The structure got caught up in aeroelastic coupling and collapsed under influence of  the wind. This disaster is still a topic among engineers and scientists discussing the aeroelastic flutter and continues to motivate their research.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432663552/sjcrdwnkh5ahzqu1z5ki.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p>
<p>In 2011, we started working on the idea more seriously, and went for a very memorable meeting with an engineering firm in Spain to discuss the idea. Result? They told us - it would never oscillate! Luckily, instead of giving up, we built a wind tunnel and  determined to demonstrate that it worked. </p>
<p>In 2012, Vortex got a substantial grant to develop the technology, and we never looked back. Today we have finalized wind tunnel tests, the deep R&amp;D is done, and we have a working prototype!</p>
<p>In 2014, we started the first field test in Gotarrendura (Avila, Spain). We are continuously improving our prototype based on the data we collected from the field test. We are very close to finalizing a commercial pilot and we need your help to get us there.</p>
<p>Today, we have a multiple patents of our technology. In April 2015 Vortex has relocated to Boston to take advantage of the nourishing cleantech innovation ecosystem. We have formed an American Advisory Board with representatives from Harvard University (Chan School of Public Health), IDEO, TerraForm Power (SunEdison Group) and Dat Venture.</p>
<br/><p></p>
<p><b>How do we know it is our time?</b></p>
<p>How many times we have asked ourselves this question… We know that with Vortex we felt our time has come to change the world. Today, many people are working on this ambitious project, and bringing us closer to our goal every day. Investors, institutions, ecologist groups, engineers, student, homeowners… With Vortex, we all feel that the right time has come.</p>
<p>Join us in this adventure, we need you!</p>

<b>Q&amp;A</b>
</div>
<div>
<p><b>What is your swept area?</b></p>
<p>Our
working area is a circular area around the tipping point of the equipment.
People often confuse the swept areas of Vortex and that of a HAWT, but keep in
mind that our equipment relies on oscillation, not on the rotation of the
blades, so our swept area has a
different shape – it’s a triangle rather than a circle. </p>
<p>We
need to be much higher to have the same swept area, in fact, it is almost twice
as high. Though, keep in mind that the normalized cost of energy (LCOE) of the
same swept are will be 40% less expensive. </p>
<p>To
scale the equipment, you need to increase the height. The swept area increases in a linear
relationship with the square of its height (the same as for HAWT)</p>
<p><b>What is your oscillation range?</b></p>
<p>Radius
of oscillation equals the diameter of Vortex at its top end.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>At what wind speeds do you work?</b></p>
<p>We
started our field prototype in Gotarrendura, Avila, Spain since summer 2014.
The average wind speed range in that location is 1-9 m/s. We are continuously
improving the design of the prototype to adapt it to the new challenges we are
facing. Our goal is to work at the wind speeds over 20m/s. We will achieve that with a syncing system to maximize the oscillation to adjust to the wind speed.</p>
<p><b>How do you adjust to turbulent wind?</b></p>
<p>To operate in unstable wind, we have designed
a synching system that dynamically modifies the frequency of natural resonance of
the structure. Small-scale Vortex usually works in a more turbulent environments,
but that is offset by the fact that they can adapt more rapidly as well. </p>
<p><b>Is it really silent?</b></p>
<p>No
part of Vortex is oscillating at a frequency audible to humans ( &gt; 20Hz ).
Naturally, the sound is strongly dependent on the speed. The maximum speed at
which our mast moves is very low compared with the speed of a blade tip for
HAWT. A well-designed and well-built carbon fiber structure does not creak. The
wind tunnel models and field models tested to date emit 0 dB. To give you a
range,  at 8 m/s, the 13 m structure oscillates at 2 Hz. At 16 m/s wind –
at 4 Hz.</p>
<p><b>What is the density that you can install in a
territory?</b></p>
<p>We say
it’s twice that of the wind turbines for the same space, but this is an approximation.
So the real number will emerge once we have more field tests. Here, it is
important to clarify that this depends on a specific geographic area. When we
“play” in the wind tunnel putting two, three or four Vortex really close to one
another, look like the vortices from the first help the second, and the third…</p>
<p><b>Who are the founders?</b></p>
We are founders, entrepreneurs, inventors,
passionate of what we are doing. We have experience in many fields... We have
been working with Vortex since 2011, and the big question always have been:
What happens if it doesn't work? We would shut it down. But the project works.
When you develop a technology there are many milestones. The first one is the
worldwide patent system, and we are really happy that we have several patents
pending, because it means we are innovating and it's working, It's not a stupid
invention<br/>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432946742/hjysq07he5qf0xkayq7w.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>¿Qué es Vortex?</b></p>
<p>Vortex es un molino de viento sin palas. En lugar de capturar la energía eólica a través del movimiento rotatorio de una turbina, Vortex aprovecha lo que se conoce como vorticidad, un efecto aerodinámico que se produce cuando el viento choca contra una estructura sólida (Vórtices de Von Karman). Vortex está diseñado para maximizar este efecto buscando la máxima absorción de energía posible.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433109007/o2d3vyf3owqcozbomzhz.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>La característica esencial del diseño se basa principlamene en la eliminación de los elementos móviles en contacto, evitando así la necesidad de lubricación y desgaste. Estas condiciones hacen que Vortex sea más económico y sencillo de mantener.</p>
<p>Básicamente, reducimos la cantidad de materia prima utilizadas para la fabricación, lo que reduce los costes de producción. Además, al no tener partes móviles en contacto, significa que hay muy pocas zonas que pueden sufrir roturas, por lo que los costes de mantenimiento también son bajos.</p>
<p>Vortex es silencioso ya que oscila a una frecuencia que no produce ruido (inferior a 20 Hz). </p>
<p>Además, es más seguro para las aves, quienes a menudo sufren por colisión con las palas.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432849024/zft0c2ri1jonl8xm8cff.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>¿Cuáles son los beneficios de Vortex?</b></p>
<p><b>Reducción de Costes</b></p>
<p>La principal ventaja de Vortex es su bajo coste, reduciendo hasta un 40% el coste de Generación de Energía (comparado con los molinos de viento tradicionales) . Estimamos que con Vortex este coste, para una instalación promedio en tierra, será de de $ 0.035 / kWh (aprox. 35 Euros / MWh), incluyendo costes de fabricación, operación y mantenimiento, diseño, arrendamiento de terrenos, seguros y otros gastos administrativos. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433123091/qbhop3jub2flrkymvh3f.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Esto posiciona a la tecnología en un lugar privilegiado en cuanto a la inversión requerida, siendo competitiva no solo con energías renovables sino también con fuentes de energía convencionales (Nuclear, Ciclos combinados de G.N, etc) como se indica en el gráfico:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432661730/gia7yxw1j4r8lhdn3miv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b>Detalles de reducción de Costes</b></p>
<p>La disminución de costes provienen por la eliminación de las partes más caras de un molino de viento convencional: palas, góndola, discos de freno, engranajaes, etc... El ahorro en estos costes es de un 53%. Además, los procesos de fabricación, transporte, construcción y montaje también se simplifican.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433123172/wnsq8pdxuvxhjtbzq9er.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>El diseño elimina completamente todos los elementos en contacto, expuestos a desgaste por fricción, ahorrándose hasta un 80% de los costes de mantenimiento en comparación con los asociados a la eólica convencional. Esto lo logramos porque no hay necesidad de cambiar ninguna pieza mecánica o usar aceite durante su vida útil.</p>
<p>Sin embargo, el diseño no es inmune a la fatiga. El viento provoca torsión y desplazamientos sobre la estructura, absorbidos principalmente por la barilla de fibra de carbono, especialmente sensibles en las secciones más bajas debido a los requerimientos mecánicos más severos. Los trabajos llevados a cabo por la compañía, confirman que las tensiones generadas en el núcleo están lejos de los límites de fatiga de los materiales usados (fibra de carbono). Un modelo computacional estima la vida operativa de la instalación entre 32 y 96 años.</p>
<p>Otro factor diferenciador es que debido a que la ubicación del alternador (y por ello del centro de gravedad) está tan bajo, se reduce la cimentación en un 50% y se  simplifican las operaciones de montaje y mantenimiento. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433123219/ag8lgqi3mgm1dqs2fbsm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Si comparásemos equipos de la misma altura, Vortex barre aproximadamente un 30% del área de un generador eólico convencional. Actualmente, Vortex captura alrededor del 40% de la energía eólica contenida en el aire, el máximo teórico que se puede lograr es del 59% (limite Betz).</p>

<p><b>El origen de Vortex Bladeless </b></p>
<p>Un día, David Yáñez cuestionó la forma en que se genera la energía eólica. Encontró otra manera prometedora para generar energía a partir del viento… <b>La idea nació.</b></p>
<p>Meses más tarde, David compartió su idea con su socio Raúl Martín, quien se convirtió en la primera persona en confiar en la idea... <b>El sueño nació.</b></p>
<p>Pero el “equipo sonador” no estaba completo. Esto sucedió cuando David Suriol se unió al equipo. Había, probablemente, un 3% de probabilidad de éxito, pero creímos en la idea y nos pusimos a trabajar…<b>El proyecto nació.</b></p>
<p>
Todo empezó en 2002,
cuando David vio por primera vez un video del movimiento del puente de Tacoma
Narrows, el cual oscilaba con el viento. La estructura entró en colapso por un
acoplamiento aeroelástico y se acabó derrumbando. Uno de los efectos (Vortex
Shedding) que provocaron este derrumbe, es un efecto que todos los ingenieros y
arquitectos tratan de evitar.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432663552/sjcrdwnkh5ahzqu1z5ki.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>En
2011, dejamos todo para dedicarnos a Vortex. Tuvimos una reunión con una de las
empresas de ingeniería más importantes de España para presentar la idea.</p>

¿Resultado? Nos dijeron que nunca oscilaría. Por suerte, en lugar de darnos por vencido, construimos un túnel de viento y decidimos  demostrar que nuestra idea funcionaba.
<p></p>
<p>En
2012, Vortex consiguió un apoyo económico para desarrollar la tecnología, y ya
no volvimos la vista atrás. Hoy hemos finalizado las pruebas de túnel de
viento, la tecnología desarrollada y patentada, y tenemos varios prototipos de
campo funcionando.</p>
<p>En
2014, iniciamos la primera prueba de campo en Gotarrendura (Ávila, España).
Estamos optimizando nuestro prototipo basándonos en los datos recogidos en las
pruebas de campo. Estamos muy cerca de finalizar un piloto comercial y
necesitamos tu ayuda para lograrlo.</p>
<p>Actualmente,
tenemos varias patentes de nuestra tecnología. En abril de 2015 Vortex se
trasladó a Boston para aprovechar el potencial en innovacion en tecnologias
renovables. Hemos formado un Consejo Asesor en EEUU con representantes de la
Universidad de Harvard (TH Chan School of Public Health), IDEO, Power Terraform (SunEdison Group) y Dat Venture.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>¿Cómo sabemos que ha llegado nuestro momento?</b></p>
<p>Cuántas veces nos hemos hecho esta pregunta ...sentimos que con Vortex ha llegado nuestro momento de cambiar el mundo. Hoy en día, muchas personas están trabajando en este ambicioso proyecto, y nos ayudan a acercarnos cada día a nuestra meta. Inversores, instituciones, grupos ecologistas, ingenieros…cada día estamos mas cerca!</p>
<p>Todos recuerdan el día en que fueron llamados para cambiar el mundo. </p>

What is Vortex?




Vortex is a wind generator without blades. Instead of capturing energy via the rotational motion of a turbine, the Vortex takes advantage of what’s known as vorticity, an aerodynamic effect that occurs when wind breaks against a solid structure (Kármán vortex street). The Vortex structure starts to oscillate, and captures the energy that is produced.





Vortex doesn’t just eliminate the blades. We have deliberately designed it to have no parts in contact at all (no gears, linkages, etc). This way we can make Vortex cheap and easy to maintain. 
Basically, we reduce the amount of raw materials used for manufacturing, which cuts the production costs and time to produce the equipment. Further, having no moving parts in contact means that there are really very few things that can break, which extends time between maintenance intervals and allows to have less down time. As a result, maintaining costs are low. 
Finally, Vortex is silent, since itoscillates at a frequency that doesn't produce audible noise (it is below 20 Hz) . It is also safer for birds that often suffer from collision with blades.




What are the benefits?
Cost
One of the main advantages of VORTEX is its dramatic low cost - it will produce energy at a 40% lower cost than a comparable wind installation. The normalized cost of energy generation ( LCOE ) for a typical onshore facility will be $ 0.035 / kWh (about 35 Euros / MWh ), including capital costs, operation and maintenance, performance, land leases, insurance and other administrative expenses.

This will put the technology at the very low range of capital intensity for such projects, it also will make it highly competitive not only against generations of alternative or renewable energy, but even compared to conventional technologies, as shown in the graph.


Breakdown of the cost savings
Cost reduction stems from reduced manufacturing costs: Vortex integrates the tower and generator into one structure, requiring less moving parts and less material to produce the same amount of electricity. Is also eliminates the nacelle, the support mechanisms and the blades that are the priciest components in a conventional wind generator. Manufacturing savings are roughly estimated at around 53 % of the usual wind turbine production cost. The manufacturing, transportation, construction and assembly will be also simplified and are typical for the wind industry.


The design completely eliminates mechanical elements that can suffer wear and tear from friction, leading to an estimated 80 % reduction in maintenance costs. We achieve this because there's no need to change any mechanical parts or add oil to the structure during it's life cycle.
Of course, it won’t be immune to fatigue. The wind can cause twisting and displacement of the structure, primarily in the elastic rod, especially in the lower section that has to withstand greater forces. However, studies carried out by the company confirm that, the stress on the rod is far from the  working limit of the materials, i.e. carbon fiber. Computational modeling estimates operational lifetime of the installation to be between 32 and 96 years .

There is another differentiating factor is that it's very easy to assemble and maintain, because the alternator (and the center of gravity) is close to the ground. This also means, we need less foundation.




The radius of oscillation is equal to the diameter of the installation at its top end (also its widest part). Vortex needs to be higher to sweep the same area. It can capture about 40% of the wind power contained in the air, the theoretical maximum you can achieve is 59% (the Betz's law).
We can put more Vortex in the same area at a lower cost and produce more electricity. The cost and density of installation compensates for a lower efficiency of energy conversion (30% less).


Vortex ProductsWithin the next 12 months we will have the first products for small-scale and residential use. The 100 W and 4 kW Vortex' work for private homes in developing countries, or small constructions like radio antennas. It can also work both connected to the grid or off-grid. Moreover, this Vortex would work perfectly in combination with solar panels. The final step is to build our dream 1 MW Vortex by 2018.








How does Vortex work?
Vortex is a fairly simple structure with 5 main parts: foundation, rod, generation system, tuning system, mast. 






The Origin of Vortex Bladeless
One day, David Yáñez questioned the way the wind energy is generated. He found another promising way to generate energy from wind. The idea was born.
Months later, David shared his idea with his business partner Raúl Martín, and he became the first person to believe in the idea. The dream was born.
But the dream team wasn't complete. This happened when David Suriol joined the team. There was, probably, a 3% chance of success, but we believed in it and went to work! The project was born.
It all started back in 2002, when David first saw a video of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge swaying and oscillating in wind. The structure got caught up in aeroelastic coupling and collapsed under influence of  the wind. This disaster is still a topic among engineers and scientists discussing the aeroelastic flutter and continues to motivate their research.


In 2011, we started working on the idea more seriously, and went for a very memorable meeting with an engineering firm in Spain to discuss the idea. Result? They told us - it would never oscillate! Luckily, instead of giving up, we built a wind tunnel and  determined to demonstrate that it worked. 
In 2012, Vortex got a substantial grant to develop the technology, and we never looked back. Today we have finalized wind tunnel tests, the deep R&D is done, and we have a working prototype!
In 2014, we started the first field test in Gotarrendura (Avila, Spain). We are continuously improving our prototype based on the data we collected from the field test. We are very close to finalizing a commercial pilot and we need your help to get us there.
Today, we have a multiple patents of our technology. In April 2015 Vortex has relocated to Boston to take advantage of the nourishing cleantech innovation ecosystem. We have formed an American Advisory Board with representatives from Harvard University (Chan School of Public Health), IDEO, TerraForm Power (SunEdison Group) and Dat Venture.

How do we know it is our time?
How many times we have asked ourselves this question… We know that with Vortex we felt our time has come to change the world. Today, many people are working on this ambitious project, and bringing us closer to our goal every day. Investors, institutions, ecologist groups, engineers, student, homeowners… With Vortex, we all feel that the right time has come.
Join us in this adventure, we need you!

Q&A


What is your swept area?
Our
working area is a circular area around the tipping point of the equipment.
People often confuse the swept areas of Vortex and that of a HAWT, but keep in
mind that our equipment relies on oscillation, not on the rotation of the
blades, so our swept area has a
different shape – it’s a triangle rather than a circle. 
We
need to be much higher to have the same swept area, in fact, it is almost twice
as high. Though, keep in mind that the normalized cost of energy (LCOE) of the
same swept are will be 40% less expensive. 
To
scale the equipment, you need to increase the height. The swept area increases in a linear
relationship with the square of its height (the same as for HAWT)
What is your oscillation range?
Radius
of oscillation equals the diameter of Vortex at its top end.

At what wind speeds do you work?
We
started our field prototype in Gotarrendura, Avila, Spain since summer 2014.
The average wind speed range in that location is 1-9 m/s. We are continuously
improving the design of the prototype to adapt it to the new challenges we are
facing. Our goal is to work at the wind speeds over 20m/s. We will achieve that with a syncing system to maximize the oscillation to adjust to the wind speed.
How do you adjust to turbulent wind?
To operate in unstable wind, we have designed
a synching system that dynamically modifies the frequency of natural resonance of
the structure. Small-scale Vortex usually works in a more turbulent environments,
but that is offset by the fact that they can adapt more rapidly as well. 
Is it really silent?
No
part of Vortex is oscillating at a frequency audible to humans ( > 20Hz ).
Naturally, the sound is strongly dependent on the speed. The maximum speed at
which our mast moves is very low compared with the speed of a blade tip for
HAWT. A well-designed and well-built carbon fiber structure does not creak. The
wind tunnel models and field models tested to date emit 0 dB. To give you a
range,  at 8 m/s, the 13 m structure oscillates at 2 Hz. At 16 m/s wind –
at 4 Hz.
What is the density that you can install in a
territory?
We say
it’s twice that of the wind turbines for the same space, but this is an approximation.
So the real number will emerge once we have more field tests. Here, it is
important to clarify that this depends on a specific geographic area. When we
“play” in the wind tunnel putting two, three or four Vortex really close to one
another, look like the vortices from the first help the second, and the third…
Who are the founders?
We are founders, entrepreneurs, inventors,
passionate of what we are doing. We have experience in many fields... We have
been working with Vortex since 2011, and the big question always have been:
What happens if it doesn't work? We would shut it down. But the project works.
When you develop a technology there are many milestones. The first one is the
worldwide patent system, and we are really happy that we have several patents
pending, because it means we are innovating and it's working, It's not a stupid
invention












CAMPAÑA en ESPAÑOL


Nuestro próximo objetivo es tener 5000 contribuidores para conseguir aproximadamente $150,000. Con esto, tendremos fondos suficientes para empezar nuestras primeras pruebas para lanzar un piloto en India. 

Actualmente, estamos trabajando por encontrar la mejor ubicación y definiendo las condiciones del proyecto. El objetivo es poder obtener datos sobre el desempeño de Vortex en diferentes condiciones, y analizar cómo se está utilizando para encontrar puntos de mejora de la tecnología.



Imagina un molino de viento... ¿Qué ocurriría si quitásemos las palas?




Necesitaríamos
menos material para construirlo, por lo que sería más económico y respetuoso
con el medio ambiente. No perjudicaría a las aves y no produciría ruido.
Deja de imaginar…¡Vortex ya es una realidad!

¿Por qué realizamos nuestro crowdfunding?

Queremos
dar a conocer la tecnología. Con el apoyo de todos, conseguiremos los recursos
suficiente para fabricar el primer piloto comercial. El futuro de esta
tecnología está en tus manos. 
Necesitamos
conseguir más de 15.000 seguidores para comenzar a cambiar el mundo y queremos
que formes parte de la revolución de Vortex. Nuestro objetivo es recaudar al
menos $50,000 que serán destinados a la elaboración del primer piloto
precomercial. 
Hemos
creado una serie de productos, basados en los valores de Vortex, como muestra
de agradecimiento por tu apoyo y colaboración. El futuro de Vortex depende de
ti.
Aquí
puedes ver algunos de los productos:


(Si conocer todos los demás, están todos al final de la página)


Para
los primeros 100 seguidores que compren un producto de al menos $40, serán
invitados a una presentación online en la que los fundadores tendrán un debate
con expertos de la Industria eólica hablando de Vortex. 
* Hemos recibido muchas preguntas acerca de por qué no pre-vendemos nuestro Vortex. La respuesta es que aún no estamos preparados a entregar el producto con la calidad que realmente sabemos que podemos conseguir. Llegaremos a ella trabajando en el diseño de Vortex y de esta forma poder entregar a nuestros clientes un producto de alta calidad, como ellos merecen.
Medios:
Cuando empezamos a preparar nuestra campaña de crowdfunding, algo increíble sucedió. Nuestra tecnología ha llamado la atención de los medios de comunicación, y se ha vuelto viral. Durante varias semanas se han publicado artículos en los principales medios de comunicación de todo el mundo, y estamos recibiendo cientos de correos electrónicos diariamente.
¡Muchísimas gracias por vuestro interés!
Aquí podéis ver algunos de los medios que están hablando de Vortex.

¿Qué es Vortex?
Vortex es un molino de viento sin palas. En lugar de capturar la energía eólica a través del movimiento rotatorio de una turbina, Vortex aprovecha lo que se conoce como vorticidad, un efecto aerodinámico que se produce cuando el viento choca contra una estructura sólida (Vórtices de Von Karman). Vortex está diseñado para maximizar este efecto buscando la máxima absorción de energía posible.


La característica esencial del diseño se basa principlamene en la eliminación de los elementos móviles en contacto, evitando así la necesidad de lubricación y desgaste. Estas condiciones hacen que Vortex sea más económico y sencillo de mantener.
Básicamente, reducimos la cantidad de materia prima utilizadas para la fabricación, lo que reduce los costes de producción. Además, al no tener partes móviles en contacto, significa que hay muy pocas zonas que pueden sufrir roturas, por lo que los costes de mantenimiento también son bajos.
Vortex es silencioso ya que oscila a una frecuencia que no produce ruido (inferior a 20 Hz). 
Además, es más seguro para las aves, quienes a menudo sufren por colisión con las palas.

¿Cuáles son los beneficios de Vortex?
Reducción de Costes
La principal ventaja de Vortex es su bajo coste, reduciendo hasta un 40% el coste de Generación de Energía (comparado con los molinos de viento tradicionales) . Estimamos que con Vortex este coste, para una instalación promedio en tierra, será de de $ 0.035 / kWh (aprox. 35 Euros / MWh), incluyendo costes de fabricación, operación y mantenimiento, diseño, arrendamiento de terrenos, seguros y otros gastos administrativos. 


Esto posiciona a la tecnología en un lugar privilegiado en cuanto a la inversión requerida, siendo competitiva no solo con energías renovables sino también con fuentes de energía convencionales (Nuclear, Ciclos combinados de G.N, etc) como se indica en el gráfico:

Detalles de reducción de Costes
La disminución de costes provienen por la eliminación de las partes más caras de un molino de viento convencional: palas, góndola, discos de freno, engranajaes, etc... El ahorro en estos costes es de un 53%. Además, los procesos de fabricación, transporte, construcción y montaje también se simplifican.  


El diseño elimina completamente todos los elementos en contacto, expuestos a desgaste por fricción, ahorrándose hasta un 80% de los costes de mantenimiento en comparación con los asociados a la eólica convencional. Esto lo logramos porque no hay necesidad de cambiar ninguna pieza mecánica o usar aceite durante su vida útil.
Sin embargo, el diseño no es inmune a la fatiga. El viento provoca torsión y desplazamientos sobre la estructura, absorbidos principalmente por la barilla de fibra de carbono, especialmente sensibles en las secciones más bajas debido a los requerimientos mecánicos más severos. Los trabajos llevados a cabo por la compañía, confirman que las tensiones generadas en el núcleo están lejos de los límites de fatiga de los materiales usados (fibra de carbono). Un modelo computacional estima la vida operativa de la instalación entre 32 y 96 años.
Otro factor diferenciador es que debido a que la ubicación del alternador (y por ello del centro de gravedad) está tan bajo, se reduce la cimentación en un 50% y se  simplifican las operaciones de montaje y mantenimiento. 


Si comparásemos equipos de la misma altura, Vortex barre aproximadamente un 30% del área de un generador eólico convencional. Actualmente, Vortex captura alrededor del 40% de la energía eólica contenida en el aire, el máximo teórico que se puede lograr es del 59% (limite Betz).


Nuestros Productos
Aproximadamente en 12 meses, tendremos los primeros productos de pequeña escala y de uso residencial. Vortex 100 W y 4 kW están diseñados para viviendas particulares en los países en desarrollo, o pequeñas comunidades. También puede funcionar tanto conectado a la red o fuera de la red. Por otra parte, estos Vortex pueden ser instalados como una unidad funcional con paneles solares. El paso final es construir nuestro gran sueño, “Vortex de 1 MW”, en 2018.








¿Cómo funciona Vortex?


Vortex
es una estructura bastante simple con 5 partes principales: fundación, núcleo,
sistema de generación, sistema de sintonización y mástil.

El origen de Vortex Bladeless 
Un día, David Yáñez cuestionó la forma en que se genera la energía eólica. Encontró otra manera prometedora para generar energía a partir del viento… La idea nació.
Meses más tarde, David compartió su idea con su socio Raúl Martín, quien se convirtió en la primera persona en confiar en la idea... El sueño nació.
Pero el “equipo sonador” no estaba completo. Esto sucedió cuando David Suriol se unió al equipo. Había, probablemente, un 3% de probabilidad de éxito, pero creímos en la idea y nos pusimos a trabajar…El proyecto nació.

Todo empezó en 2002,
cuando David vio por primera vez un video del movimiento del puente de Tacoma
Narrows, el cual oscilaba con el viento. La estructura entró en colapso por un
acoplamiento aeroelástico y se acabó derrumbando. Uno de los efectos (Vortex
Shedding) que provocaron este derrumbe, es un efecto que todos los ingenieros y
arquitectos tratan de evitar.



En
2011, dejamos todo para dedicarnos a Vortex. Tuvimos una reunión con una de las
empresas de ingeniería más importantes de España para presentar la idea.

¿Resultado? Nos dijeron que nunca oscilaría. Por suerte, en lugar de darnos por vencido, construimos un túnel de viento y decidimos  demostrar que nuestra idea funcionaba.

En
2012, Vortex consiguió un apoyo económico para desarrollar la tecnología, y ya
no volvimos la vista atrás. Hoy hemos finalizado las pruebas de túnel de
viento, la tecnología desarrollada y patentada, y tenemos varios prototipos de
campo funcionando.
En
2014, iniciamos la primera prueba de campo en Gotarrendura (Ávila, España).
Estamos optimizando nuestro prototipo basándonos en los datos recogidos en las
pruebas de campo. Estamos muy cerca de finalizar un piloto comercial y
necesitamos tu ayuda para lograrlo.
Actualmente,
tenemos varias patentes de nuestra tecnología. En abril de 2015 Vortex se
trasladó a Boston para aprovechar el potencial en innovacion en tecnologias
renovables. Hemos formado un Consejo Asesor en EEUU con representantes de la
Universidad de Harvard (TH Chan School of Public Health), IDEO, Power Terraform (SunEdison Group) y Dat Venture.

¿Cómo sabemos que ha llegado nuestro momento?
Cuántas veces nos hemos hecho esta pregunta ...sentimos que con Vortex ha llegado nuestro momento de cambiar el mundo. Hoy en día, muchas personas están trabajando en este ambicioso proyecto, y nos ayudan a acercarnos cada día a nuestra meta. Inversores, instituciones, grupos ecologistas, ingenieros…cada día estamos mas cerca!
Todos recuerdan el día en que fueron llamados para cambiar el mundo. 
Vortex, El molino de viento sin palas que revolucionará las energías renovables siendo accesible para todo el mundo.
Únete a nosotros en esta aventura ¡Te necesitamos!

Drawn from the world’s leading universities and consultancies, the Fellows were chosen for their combination of interdisciplinary scientific/engineering expertise and achievements in technology commercialization, foresight, entrepreneurship, and policy.GLOBAL FELLOWSThe Global Fellows have generated scores of new companies, influenced legislation, and advised entrepreneurs and political leaders.Instrumental in Austin’s transformation to a premier techno-hub, the Fellows continue to address issues of importance to cities, states, nations, and the world.Please visit www.tando.org to see the Fellows' biographies and their range of expertise. They are indisputably world-class talent.OUR MUTUAL NEEDThe Fellows recently spun out of the University of Texas at Austin and formed a non-profit Think-And-Do (TANDO) Tank. Unfortunately, the Fellows Program's funding did not follow us out of the university. TANDO seeks startup funds to cover all the usual services that are needed to start an office, a staff, and operations.The Fellows have, and will continue to, attack the world's big, nasty, and ill-structured problems. Distinguished reputations and long experience in the multi-disciplinary shepherding of innovations from lab to market qualify the Fellows to evaluate and commercialize technological ""solutions"" to problems of climate, water, food, gender equity, corporate governance, energy, space policy, and other (as I said) big, nasty problems. Progress on these problems improves your life, mine, and those of many other people.Though all are successful authors, the TANDO Fellows do not want to bombard you with more white papers and newsletters. We demonstrate our value through successful projects. We have begun to do so, consulting for a friendly government on international technology transfer. Our Fellows are, however, well-received speakers and interviewees in companies and media.IF YOU CANNOT DONATEConnect TANDO with potential clients. C-level corporate and cabinet or ministerial-level government.Connect TANDO with potential sources of endowments. Write to TANDO at info@tando.org.THANK YOU!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

With Enki Stove Wild, you will not need it anymore. All that you can use is around you, in nature. If you need an extra charge, you can also buy a 15 kg wood pellet bag: it costs about 4$ and allows you to cook up to 55 hours! Our devices do not need long preparation, as charcoal grills do, and they are ready to cook in a few seconds.Powerful as it needsWhen you have to cook for just a few people, you must carry a huge tank with you. Until now. The two different sizes of Enki Stove Wild are the solution: portable and light, suitable for a small party, up to 4 people; strong and more powerful, for bigger groups. The adjustable flame allows a complete control between power, heat and duration.Lighter than the gas tanks you should carry for the same powerEnki Stove Wild weights 1.3 kg and Wild+ 2.7 kg: that will be all the weight you need to carry, for a small ride or for a long trip, surrounded by nature as well.Design to last foreverEnki Stove devices are built with aluminium 1000 series and stainless steel AINSI 316; these materials are also used on nautical manufacture. We choose only reliable and long-lasting materials to withstand to heat and storms. Enki Stove Wild will be your best travel companion.Integrated wind shield and pot holder, designed to fit in every situationEvery Enki Stove Wild is a unique item containing all you can need. In this way, forgetting something at home is quite impossible. Enki Stove Wild is not supposed to be a problem, rather a solution.Designed and made in ItalyStrong and reliable are not synonymous of bad. We care a lot about the design of our stoves and each particular has a specific function: the conical shape for strength and stability; 3D laser cut for a light but crushproof structure.ISO 9600 certificationEnki Stove Wild is entirely manufactured in Italy by high-precision mechanic workshop. The laboratory follows strict productive standards, required also by medical venture and high voltage transportation.WHY SHOULD I USE ENKI STOVE WILD, INSTEAD OF A TRADITIONAL GRILL?Because it is a real gourmet kitchen tool, not just a way out  We designed Enki Stove Wild not only to be a valid replacement of your home burner but wood powered. We designed our stove from the ground up, rethinking the outdoor cooking experience. We start our project from the fire of our dreams: powerful, reliable and ready for anything. It is smokeless because we care about you and the planet.Because you have never thought about how much carbon dioxide is linked to charcoal production and useEvery time you burn 1kg of charcoal for a cook out, 3,67kg of CO2 are released in the air. Yes, the ribs you’re cooking are producing the same amount of CO2 produced by a SUV for a 100 km trip. Even a traditional bonfire with 10kg of wood produces 15kg of CO2 as much as two days of home heating. Enki Stove Wild traps all the carbon produced into the soil, improves the feature of the ground and increases oxygen production.Because no smoke, means no hassle  A smokeless firepit avoids not only smelly clothes, but also serious respiratory illnesses bounded to harmful emissions of a traditional fire. Enki Stove Wild offers just the pleasure of fire, without any bother.Because it's simple to set and easy to use  The three feet structure allows a stable positioning of the stove on every kind of ground, avoiding the use of screws or other gadgets. Set, full with every kind of biomass, light up and cook in less than a minute.Because you will never run out of fuel: off grid is betterDo you know the feeling when the gas tanks runs out of power in the middle of the party? And when the charcoal finishes before your ribs are ready? Stop being scared of it. All that you need is around you, in nature. There is more! If you use Enki Stove Solar Charger, you can also forget battery. Off grid has never been so exciting.Why did we realise Enki Stove Wild?Reaching the today’s result it has been hard: it has taken more than 4 years of rounds of prototyping and experiments. What we offer now is a tested product, validated by more than 50 early adopters. Our stove has been tested with their attention and, thanks to their useful and continuous feedbacks, we designed the ultimate stove.A real need, home heating  Our story began when Ivan, in 2011 was off campus engineering student at university and received an excessive gas bill, which he could not pay. He decided to create a stove without a vent and powered by waste material. He needed a burner with no emissions, capable of burning without pollution, as a home burner. And we got it.An ancient technology, brought to the top of its features  Pyrolysis is a well-known technology used for a century by industries and, 1500 years ago, American natives used “terra preta”, a particular kind of soil mixed with biochar, extremely fertile. In the last few years, there has been a rediscovery of pyrolysis, but nobody has reached Enki Stove Wild stability and efficiency.Lots of prototypes, one solution, countless possibilitiesThe already existent pyrolytic stoves have 3 big issues: they are unstable, they run only with ultra-dry and homogeneous biomass and are not rechargeable.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Welcome to <a href=""www.maseg.biz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MaSEG</a>, I’m Richard Kilgore, inventor of the Magnified Solar Energy Generator.</p>
<p>My education is in Business and Electrical Engineering.</p>
<p>My background also includes construction, manufacturing, wholesale and retail sales.</p>
<p>In 1977, I had an idea, an idea to <strong>develop solar energy without using solar panels</strong> while producing efficiency more than four times greater than other solar devices. Right out of the gate I realized, solar energy only works when the sun’s shining, so I had to overcome that obstacle first. And, In order to be efficient and cost effective, solar energy must be converted into other multiple forms of energy, and then, used in conversion to electricity.</p>
<p>After many long hours of research and development and tens of thousands of dollars, <strong>I discovered how to generate electricity 24/7, continuously, with a MaSEG unit.</strong> Until now, solar panels and solar devices could not give you that capability.</p>
<p>We have come a long way, through times when people thought that solar energy wasn’t even feasible, thinking, there couldn’t be enough electricity produced to really make a difference. Politics, business and our environment have gone through a total transformation with no real answers in sight to questions remotely related to solar energy. <strong>In 1977, renewable, green energy wasn’t feasible or even heard of for that matter, but today, not only is it feasible, it can also be efficient and cost effective with a MaSEG unit, in any size or output.</strong></p>
<p>A Patent Application was filed August of 2011 and now it has become necessary to defend that patent to its completion. Along with that defense, the purpose of this <strong>project is to build a MaSEG unit that will supply 20 homes with electricity well below the prevailing kWh market price while paying for itself in 2 to 5 years</strong> depending on your local pricing by selling extra power on the grid. <strong>This will be our first residential production model.</strong></p>
<p>This initial project is to get MaSEG off the ground and into production. <strong>Pledges and/or donations are not to be used as profit.</strong> All donations will be used for research, development and associated costs to get MaSEG ready to become a marketable product to help people everywhere.</p>
<p>With people like you, who are interested in renewable, green energy, less oil dependency or maybe just a clean environment, we can complete MaSEG while helping our friends and neighbors around the globe.</p>
<p>Man is not meant to walk alone. I’m not asking you to walk behind me or ahead of me. I’m asking you to <strong>walk with me arm and arm together</strong>, so we can make great strides in making solar energy available everywhere.</p>
<p>Thank you for your interest, if you participate with us, <strong>the world will thank YOU for MaSEG</strong> and for making our world a better place for everyone. Be sure to view the MaSEG videos and updates to keep up with all the details and don’t forget the perks for your donations to reach our goals, “they are awesome”.</p>
<p>We need your help in getting the word out about this MaSEG project. So tell everyone you personally know through emails, casual conversations, phone calls and social media. <strong>Without you, we cannot move forward with completing our patent or building our first residential production model.</strong></p>

Over the next 6 months manufacturers of off the shelf products such as steam engines, generators and batteries were located. Don't forget, this was in the late 1970's. Over the next 5 years I developed a solar collector, a heat transfer unit and a boiler. Then due to the lack of funding and the lack of interest the project slowed to an almost standstill. ""I could not let it go."" It stayed on my mind until the 1990's with very little progress. Then I started trying to get a patent. Three years of hard work, research and development went into getting it ready for patent but it was not ready for patent. It was really only feasible at that point for desert-like environments. The focus then shifted to developing a way to generate electricity 24/7, continuously. Finally in 2010, I solved the problem, came up with the name Magnified Solar Energy Generator, (<a href=""http://www.maseg.biz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MaSEG</a>) and filed the patent August of 2011. So it has been now 36 years since the original idea. I cannot give up; it is a God given project to help the world.

I am Greg Wilson, the president of WindJammer Energy. I have been issued the patent by the US Patent Office for a new type of wind energy called WindJammer Generators, the future of wind energy. I am a certified gas and diesel mechanic, studied construction engineering and worked as a job site supervisor, sailor, and long distance semi driver. I have combined my knowledge of automotive drivetrains and gear designs with sails and equipment on sailboats to make a new wind generator that produces electricity. Using my experience building bridges and driving coast to coast I have calculated how structures can support WindJammers Generators. About 15 years ago I realized how much energy is captured by sails on a sail boat. Working for years I developed a simple design that will adapt to its surroundings. New sailing equipment and electronics entering the market and building the new grid will make this wind energy possible now.</p>
<p><strong>WindJammer Generators</strong><br/>WindJammers use large sails to capture wind energy and produce electricity where consumers use it. They are not wind turbines, do not look or operate like wind turbines. The Eco friendly quiet, slow moving sails and Base Units are bird, bat and people friendly. The big white sails capture wind energy which is transferred down a line in a reciprocating motion to the Base Unit that produces electricity. We use old sails off of sailboats or new sails that are made from recycled plastic, cloth, palm fronds, etc... The sails reflect sunlight back into space creating a big cool shadow helping to cool the planet. Pictures or art work can be displayed on the sails for an artistic vista or advertising. New sail plans are covered in the patent. WindJammers will be Made in the USA. To reduce construction costs the sails are made to fit local structures such as flag poles, live trees, houses, buildings, water towers, it can go really big on a radio tower. When the wind stops blowing helium balloons can lift large spinnaker sails into the sky catching more wind. New prototypes, including models for cars, are constantly being designed. Large WindJammers will produce more than 10,000 kilowatt per hour (kWh) powering 10,000 homes with a rapid payoff compared to the biggest 6,000 kWh wind turbines now built. We will be working with local business as WindJammers will use several different trades to build the prototypes. We are ready to build and market several different WindJammers.</p>
<p><strong>We Can Build The New Green Energy!</strong><br/>We can change to a locally produced renewable energy. Producing electricity where it is consumed WindJammers will end power blackouts after disasters even when the grid is damaged. The US Department of Energy is starting work on building a new power grid for renewable energy. Our vision for WindJammer Energy is too expand across the country hiring employees, opening offices, factories, and working with local power companies to service customers. WindJammer's electricity can run water pumps supplying running water to undeveloped communities. Climate change and rising ocean temperatures cause extreme weather events. Superstorm Sandy was a small hurricane that combined with a Nor'easter causing billions of dollars in damages to the Northeast. There will be many more extreme weather events caused from burning fossil fuels and we must respond to raising CO2 levels and the terrible storms it causes. <br/>President Obama stated in his inaugural address. ""We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations. But America cannot resist this transition; we must lead it.""</p>
<p><strong>Making the Change</strong><br/>WindJammer Generators will reduce our dependency on coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear power and hydroelectric dams. As the BP Deep Horizon sank it exposed the dangers of deep ocean drilling with the millions of gallons crude oil spilled into the Gulf of Mexico. Spraying 2 million gallons of Corexit dispersant to clean up the oil poisoned gulf coast residents and sea life. Shell's 2012 Arctic Ocean drilling attempt failed as storms blew the drill rigs aground. Burning coal and oil causes CO2 levels to rise and carbon black exhaust soot is turning glacier ice black melting it faster as seen in the movie ""Chasing Ice"". Mountaintop Removal Coal Mining has demolished over 500 Appalachian Mountaintops devastating ecosystems and water supplies. WindJammers can be install on trees living on the mountaintops with no environmental impact while saving the mountains. Old coal power plants can become WindJammer wind farms. Burning fossil fuels also cause cancers, lung disease, birth defects, etc… Drilling natural gas wells use dangerous fracking to get the gas and the equipment leaks methane, a greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. Buildings blow up due to leaking natural gas causing death. Fukushima Nuclear Plants are leaking radioactive material that will take centuries to clean up, but the industry wants to build more nukes. The Columbia River hydroelectric dams block salmon reproduction forcing some species into extinction. WindJammers could turn the Columbia River Gorge into a 1,200 mile long wind farm making the dams obsolete. New technology takes time to change the market place. Do we have adequate time to save Mother Earth?</p>

<p>The observation hive is not a new concept in beekeeping - but existing styles of observation hives haven't changed in decades, and they are limited in their functionality. Not anymore: BEEcosystem is designed specifically to be simple and modular, expanding across your wall in any hexagonal pattern.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1514960686/kootdmphotsihwutfvpk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Even if your BEEcosystem hive is setup outdoors, the unique modularity allows for the hive colonies to be securely and easily closed off for events and educational purposes. Afterwards, simply reattach the hive to its home and open one of the vents.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1514961136/hwlg4p0duxlfgxbuzqoo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are a team of two who originally met while attending Penn State University together back in 2012. Dustin was studying biology and working in a honeybee research lab, and Mike was studying architecture and working on urban farming design modeling - since then, <a href=""https://beecosystem.buzz/portfolio/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">we have a substantial track record of collaborating together successfully over the past 5+ years on a variety of interior agro/eco design-build projects</a>.  <strong>This campaign is about growing the BEEcosystem community as we enter our second year of business as BEEcosystem LLC.</strong> By supporting our campaign, your contribution is directly helping us to grow our manufacturing capabilities this year, bringing more BEEcosystem hives to more people, and helping educate one another about the critical roles that pollinators play in agriculture and the environment.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1514961343/gl3fvgcwkpbn35ni9g8j.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>When we began this project by prototyping our first hives in Fall 2014 and then installing our first experimental hive colonies in the Spring 2015 season, we already knew that there was a LOT of room for innovation in observation hives. BEEcosystem's modern and elegant design not only looks great, but also addresses the common irritations users have with existing observation hives:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1514961491/epvptaxkyqdp8di7a8ct.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>If you’re a beekeeper, you know that Langstroth and Warre hives have always expanded vertically by adding new boxes and supers—now, BEEcosystem is the first observation hive to use the same tried and true logic, but on a horizontal plane, expanding across your wall in a hexagonal pattern.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1514961730/wleqbucd3zablfndzjgs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>BEEcosystem's modular expansion works by using our unique (patent pending) vent-to-passageway magnetic connection points. Because both the hive’s side vents and additional hive bodies attach magnetically, by simply sliding out any one of the four side-ventilation screens, another BEEcosystem hive body can be attached to create a more spacious hive interior—giving your colony room to grow and thrive.</p>
<p>By using magnetic alignment, BEEcosystem units connect together effortlessly—and because we use powerful magnets, they also connect together securely—delivering both peace of mind and ease of installation.</p>

<p>When we began work on the very first BEEcosystem prototypes in October 2014, our goal was to design the most user-friendly observation honeybee hive ever built, period.</p>
<p>This past year, we put the first commercially-available BEEcosystem hives into the hands of several dozen customers and beekeepers, who sent us overwhelmingly positive feedback. Listening to that feedback, we heard one commonality for a proposed design tweak—that there was a desire for the hive to open from the <i>front</i> rather than from the <i>back,</i> so that <i>outdoor</i> hives could be opened up and maintained directly in place, without having to remove them from the wall in order to open them from the back. We are pleased to announce that beginning now, all 2018 BEEcosystem hives will feature this update! Additionally, all 2018 hives will also still be contiguous with the 2017 (back-opening) hive models, so that all of our existing customers can modularly connect new 2018 hives with their current 2017 hives. </p>
<p>We strongly believe that we have designed a hive product that meets the needs and desires of our customers, and is indeed the most user-friendly observation hive ever built. The diagram below illustrates some features detailed in the 2018 BEEcosystem hive specifications:</p>

Whether that be offering advice, pointing you in the right direction for answers, or trying to connect you with your local beekeepers association, <strong>we want you and your BEEcosystem hives to be setup for success. </strong></p>
<p>Through our new Ambassador Program, we are in the process of building a platform to facilitate more connections between beekeepers and non-beekeepers, who are likewise passionate about helping take action to support pollinator protection. Our goal is to connect experienced beekeepers with less experienced BEEcosystem observation hive customers: beekeepers act as ""sideliners,"" helping to maintain BEEcosystem hives on their own terms, most typically for agro/eco businesses or environmental education centers that host BEEcosystem hives—and Ambassador beekeepers can get paid for providing their knowledge and services. <a href=""https://beecosystem.buzz/beekeeper-ambassador-program/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">For more information, visit the Beekeeper Ambassador page on our website</a>. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Because we have already been manufacturing and fulfilling BEEcosystem hive orders for the past year, fulfilling backers' campaign pledges will not be a challenge for our team, regardless of whether or not we meet our flex funding goal. We have our manufacturing supply chain in place, and the manufacturing run will absolutely happen—so backers can rest assured that they will receive their orders/perks. Our goal in launching this campaign is simply to consolidate some preorders ahead of the 2018 season, which will help make our first manufacturing run of the 2018 year even more successful, as well as to help generate some buzz in coordination with our exhibition at this year's big American Beekeeping Federation Conference and Trade Show in Reno, the largest beekeeping conference in the USA.</p>
<p>A consistent challenge we face today, as we have also faced in the past, is in helping to guide novice beekeepers who back our campaign—BEEcosystem attracts all kinds of people, and we designed it to be beautiful and interesting so that it does just that—so if you're a first-time beekeeper, we welcome you to the BEEcosystem community! However, we consider it our responsibility to offer some guidance to new beekeepers, and also to correct those who might hold the misperception that beekeeping is an effortless hobby that magically produces honey. Unfortunately, this is simply not the case. In fact, many beekeepers will conservatively recommend waiting until after hive's <i>second</i> fall/autumn season in order to harvest honey for the first time, and even then only harvesting the <i>surplus</i> honey that bees have stored up, so that they do not starve themselves overwintering, which can happen if too much honey is harvested. <strong>Beekeeping is certainly not difficult to learn, but it does require a desire to <i>want</i> to learn it! </strong>Luckily, beekeepers tend to be the most curious educators, who love to help one another learn continuously—and the level support out there for beginner beekeepers is truly enormous. We are thrilled be a part of that support system for first time beekeepers, and we do provide some resources, as well as openly welcome questions from those getting started for the first time.</p>

Unfortunately, this is the harsh reality of nature and a true fact of beekeeping—but it is also a driving motivation for the creation of BEEcosystem: because by together encouraging new hobbyist beekeepers to host more hives, we all help make small contributions to our localized honeybee genetic diversities. Some researchers believe the best hope for honeybees' future will lie in their ability to naturally adapt and evolve resistances to the various localized stressors that contribute to Colony Collapse. Therefore, by keeping bees in your local community, you ARE helping to naturally foster that random genetic diversity—so remember, if your colony does fail, that does not make you a failure as a beekeeper. On the contrary, it proves you ARE a beekeeper for having tried, and you will always have the ability to continue beekeeping, by starting up a new colony the next season, and helping add that pollinator genetic diversity to your local area.</p>

</div></div>","The observation hive is not a new concept in beekeeping - but existing styles of observation hives haven't changed in decades, and they are limited in their functionality. Not anymore: BEEcosystem is designed specifically to be simple and modular, expanding across your wall in any hexagonal pattern.

Even if your BEEcosystem hive is setup outdoors, the unique modularity allows for the hive colonies to be securely and easily closed off for events and educational purposes. Afterwards, simply reattach the hive to its home and open one of the vents.

We are a team of two who originally met while attending Penn State University together back in 2012. Dustin was studying biology and working in a honeybee research lab, and Mike was studying architecture and working on urban farming design modeling - since then, we have a substantial track record of collaborating together successfully over the past 5+ years on a variety of interior agro/eco design-build projects.  This campaign is about growing the BEEcosystem community as we enter our second year of business as BEEcosystem LLC. By supporting our campaign, your contribution is directly helping us to grow our manufacturing capabilities this year, bringing more BEEcosystem hives to more people, and helping educate one another about the critical roles that pollinators play in agriculture and the environment.


When we began this project by prototyping our first hives in Fall 2014 and then installing our first experimental hive colonies in the Spring 2015 season, we already knew that there was a LOT of room for innovation in observation hives. BEEcosystem's modern and elegant design not only looks great, but also addresses the common irritations users have with existing observation hives:


If you’re a beekeeper, you know that Langstroth and Warre hives have always expanded vertically by adding new boxes and supers—now, BEEcosystem is the first observation hive to use the same tried and true logic, but on a horizontal plane, expanding across your wall in a hexagonal pattern.

BEEcosystem's modular expansion works by using our unique (patent pending) vent-to-passageway magnetic connection points. Because both the hive’s side vents and additional hive bodies attach magnetically, by simply sliding out any one of the four side-ventilation screens, another BEEcosystem hive body can be attached to create a more spacious hive interior—giving your colony room to grow and thrive.
By using magnetic alignment, BEEcosystem units connect together effortlessly—and because we use powerful magnets, they also connect together securely—delivering both peace of mind and ease of installation.



 






When we began work on the very first BEEcosystem prototypes in October 2014, our goal was to design the most user-friendly observation honeybee hive ever built, period.
This past year, we put the first commercially-available BEEcosystem hives into the hands of several dozen customers and beekeepers, who sent us overwhelmingly positive feedback. Listening to that feedback, we heard one commonality for a proposed design tweak—that there was a desire for the hive to open from the front rather than from the back, so that outdoor hives could be opened up and maintained directly in place, without having to remove them from the wall in order to open them from the back. We are pleased to announce that beginning now, all 2018 BEEcosystem hives will feature this update! Additionally, all 2018 hives will also still be contiguous with the 2017 (back-opening) hive models, so that all of our existing customers can modularly connect new 2018 hives with their current 2017 hives. 
We strongly believe that we have designed a hive product that meets the needs and desires of our customers, and is indeed the most user-friendly observation hive ever built. The diagram below illustrates some features detailed in the 2018 BEEcosystem hive specifications:

Great! Welcome to the fascinating world of apiculture. If you are new, we are here to help you learn. Whether that be offering advice, pointing you in the right direction for answers, or trying to connect you with your local beekeepers association, we want you and your BEEcosystem hives to be setup for success. 
Through our new Ambassador Program, we are in the process of building a platform to facilitate more connections between beekeepers and non-beekeepers, who are likewise passionate about helping take action to support pollinator protection. Our goal is to connect experienced beekeepers with less experienced BEEcosystem observation hive customers: beekeepers act as ""sideliners,"" helping to maintain BEEcosystem hives on their own terms, most typically for agro/eco businesses or environmental education centers that host BEEcosystem hives—and Ambassador beekeepers can get paid for providing their knowledge and services. For more information, visit the Beekeeper Ambassador page on our website. 



BEEcosystem LLC was cofounded by Mike Zaengle and Dustin Betz, and officially incorporated in January of 2017. Mike and Dustin have worked together over the past 5+ years on a wide variety of interior agro/eco design-build projects, from aquaponic miniature container farms and rotating living wall vertical farms, to hydroponic furnishing pieces for a variety of residential and commercial clients.

Risks & Challenges
Because we have already been manufacturing and fulfilling BEEcosystem hive orders for the past year, fulfilling backers' campaign pledges will not be a challenge for our team, regardless of whether or not we meet our flex funding goal. We have our manufacturing supply chain in place, and the manufacturing run will absolutely happen—so backers can rest assured that they will receive their orders/perks. Our goal in launching this campaign is simply to consolidate some preorders ahead of the 2018 season, which will help make our first manufacturing run of the 2018 year even more successful, as well as to help generate some buzz in coordination with our exhibition at this year's big American Beekeeping Federation Conference and Trade Show in Reno, the largest beekeeping conference in the USA.
A consistent challenge we face today, as we have also faced in the past, is in helping to guide novice beekeepers who back our campaign—BEEcosystem attracts all kinds of people, and we designed it to be beautiful and interesting so that it does just that—so if you're a first-time beekeeper, we welcome you to the BEEcosystem community! However, we consider it our responsibility to offer some guidance to new beekeepers, and also to correct those who might hold the misperception that beekeeping is an effortless hobby that magically produces honey. Unfortunately, this is simply not the case. In fact, many beekeepers will conservatively recommend waiting until after hive's second fall/autumn season in order to harvest honey for the first time, and even then only harvesting the surplus honey that bees have stored up, so that they do not starve themselves overwintering, which can happen if too much honey is harvested. Beekeeping is certainly not difficult to learn, but it does require a desire to want to learn it! Luckily, beekeepers tend to be the most curious educators, who love to help one another learn continuously—and the level support out there for beginner beekeepers is truly enormous. We are thrilled be a part of that support system for first time beekeepers, and we do provide some resources, as well as openly welcome questions from those getting started for the first time.
Going hand-in-hand with beginner beekeeping, another unique challenge comes in the form of making sure our backers know their local beekeeping laws and ordinances. While the tides of stigma are changing, some municipalities still ban beekeeping outright. It is important to check with your state and local laws and ordinances, as some states also require beekeepers to register their hive(s). Both throughout and following the campaign, our team will make ourselves available to work closely with our backers and make sure everyone understands their local laws and regulations, as well as how to meet them.

</div></div>","Thank you to all our backers for your incredible support! We truly appreciate each and every one of you! If you missed the chance to back our IndieGoGo campaign, all is not lost! Head over the http://www.hydrobee.com/gethydrobee where we'll continue to take pre-orders until we are in production.Sincerely,Burt & the Hydrobee TeamOne way to charge Hydrobee is to drop it in the river using the Streambee attachment and the water current charge the battery.  See UPDATE listing the award-winning design features!Hydrobee generates power for your phone/camera/anything charged by USB, from nature any time and any where.Some of the people who will benefit from a Hydrobee are use any kind of USB device (camera, phone, lamp, :
Campers (can charge in a river with a Streambee or Sun with Sunbee)
Preppers (can charge in a river with a Streambee or Sun with Sunbee)
Bikers (can charge it by attaching to their bike frame to draw energy from turning wheel)
Parents (can attach it to their jogging strollers or bike) 
Fisherman/Sailer (can use the Streambee and just let the water currents charge it behind boat or from the shore) 
Anyone (can use the hand crank, water currents from sink as you wash dishes or whatever accessory makes the most sense for you)
You can charge ANY USB powered device with the Hydrobee.  It has 2 USB 3.0 ports and a 5000 mAh battery, powerful enough to charge 2 smart phones or many tablets (not iPads).The Hydrobee battery takes about 3 hours to charge from a USB 2.0 wall power outlet, or from one of our accessory rotors, the same charge time as a smart phone with the same wall power.  







When the ""can"" body is removed from the mounting bracket, add the LED puck so it becomes a powerful flashlight.  Sit Hydrobee on its base and attach the collapsible soft plastic lamp shade and illuminate a room or camp site.

Great question!


Attach the Hydrobee to anything, then use our accessory rotors to spin the generator.  The rotors for wind, bikes, rivers and water pipes are in development.
The modular design is the size of a soda can, because a can may be delivered anywhere.  Think turbines in six-packs.  When any modular part wears out, especially the batteries, they can be easily replaced.  




The mounting block is for long-term installation of the Hydrobee, where you want a fixed charging source like:


wagon
belt drive
waterwheel
bike
treadmill
...or anything that can move for hours.  

You can unscrew the Hydrobee battery from the mounting block and take it with you for power and light.  You DON'T need the mounting block to go camping with Hydrobee.  It's a powerful backup battery, with hand crank for extra power, and a flashlight/table lamp, which should be enough phone and light power for a 2-4 day trip away from it all. 
Hydrobee makes it affordable to a billion people in poverty who can use existing ""pay as you go"" to pay just a few dollars a week to buy the Hydrobee.  This is being done now for solar panels, but Hydrobees are better because they can charge from sun and also from flowing water, wind, and other natural energy sources.  
Please back us so we can finish the production and field testing faster and tell us what you want to charge your Hydrobee!. 




Our first accessory stemmed from our original vision of Hydrobee. We made a tiny turbine in a can and attached it to a faucet to charge batteries from water flowing through it.  But there's no faucet when we are camping or living off the grid!   So we invented the Streambee to hold the turbine in the water current in streams and rivers.  The flowing water spins the external propeller which then turns the generator and charges the battery.  When it's charged, just ""reel it in"" and take the battery to go. Now it's a power pack with LOTS of accessories in development to harvest the clean energy from nature.

The Evolution of the Hydrobee:







What is Your Local Renewable Energy Source?
Water faucets and pipes:  If there is a blackout and no electricity for several days, you may still have water pressure from a gravity-fed reservoir system.  Attach the Hydrobee and the ""PipeBee"" rotor to a water faucet and generate power whenever you run water for drinking, cooking, cleaning, gardening or irrigation.
Streams and rivers:  If there is water flow faster than 4 knots (fast walking speed) and deeper than 12 inches, the StreamBee floating accessory can harvest the hydrokinetic energy and charge the Hydrobee battery.  Below:  3-D printed full size model of the Streambee.


Sailboats and canoes:   Tow the StreamBee behind and let the wind or your muscles power it up!  Keep up a good pace, you need 4 knots or about 7.5 km/hour of speed for ""standard"" charging times of 3 hours.  
Wind:  Use our WindBee folding wind propeller and pole mount to put up the Hydrobee in wind.  
Bikes:   The BikeBee rolls against the bike tire.  
Muscles:   The CrankBee is spun by hand.  Here's a picture of it attached to a table, with the LED lamp attachment.  


The KickBee holds a car wheel rim and tire flat on the floor, on its side, on a bearing on a short post.  Sit in a chair and push it with your feet to spin and run the Hydrobee on the post via a belt drive.  Works with most car rims and tires.
Sun:   SunBee is a roll-up 10W solar panel that fits in a soda can.
We have not made the accessories yet because we don't know which ones are going to be the most popular.  The tooling to mass produce each accessory is expensive.  We will survey all backers to learn what they want, and backers will get a coupon for a free accessory of their choice when they are available in 2015.

For over a billion people, having a USB power source for phones and LED lights is revolutionary.  Right now they spend over $30 billion a year buying micro-charges for a few pennies a time.  They also spend about $30B a year buying kerosene fuel for dirty dangerous little lamps.   But just finding charging sources and fuel also uses a huge amount of their time, so it costs them lost work as well.  If they can get useful USB power from nature around them it will make their lives better immediately.  Because the Hydrobee can be recharged by any kind of natural energy, it will work for most people and be affordable through mass production.  



How can very poor people afford a modern personal power plant?  The same way they pay for their mobile phones:  a few cents a day.  If they don't pay, their service goes off.  They now buy solar charging systems this way.  The systems have a cell phone chip in them.  The owners pay every month for it or it's turned off with a text message from the vendor.  Over 20 million solar systems are now installed in village huts around the world and most of them are financed this way.  The Hydrobee also has a cell phone or pager chip.  We will provide it as an upgrade to the systems already in place because it accepts the solar charge but also makes power when there is no strong sun.  Read more about it here.



Anything that harvests energy from nature must be very rugged and suitable for many environments.   We have a technology risk to make our Hydrobee as tough as possible while remaining affordable.   All our components are currently made in field versions for other products and we will do extensive field testing before we launch into full sales.  Our Advisor for Testing is Eric Rasmussen, MD, who is a a principal at Infinitum Humanitarian Systems and is a global expert in disaster response technologies.  

There is market risk for the sale of Hydrobees over micro-finance and mobile payment systems.  These systems must be in place and trusted before we can benefit from them.  However, they are spreading fast in India and Africa and will soon be found in Central and South America.  There are many models and companies in this area now, so we will partner with the winners.  We are advised on micro-finance by Global Partnerships, a non-profit organization with micro finance and solar lighting distribution projects throughout Central and South America.
A solution for USA is not necessarily a solution for Uganda or Bolivia or Thailand.  We have a risk of the ""product fit"" for different markets.  To get help designing the right accessories for different markets, we will hold global ""Design-a-Thons"" with the Impact Hub centers around the world.     
Other Ways You Can Help  If you can't back us with a little money, you can still help.  Please take our online survey and tell us what you want and how you'll use the Hydrobee.

 A Drone for Life Climate change is radically modifying seasons’ balance and the ecosystem we inhabit: temperatures are increasing, rainfall trends are changing and seas average levels are going up. All the aforementioned causes have brought up the number of catastrophical events such as floods and hurricanes, sometimes with terrible consequences, both for men and other living species. Such abrupt climate changes are decreasing the possibilities to properly adapt to the new ecosystem, multiplying the chance of extinction.Man is not only modifying the climate’s “behavior”, but has also introduced new polluting agents like microplastics. These substances are threatening sea’s biodiversity producing most of the food and almost half of the oxygen of our planet.In order to effectively tackle these issues, researchers have the necessity to acquire environmental meteo sea data, detect pollutants dissolved in water and monitor the evolution of the ecosystems.The need is to acquire data where most likely life has actually begun, in order to provide researchers with a time series data to analyse and use to find the most suitable solution.Working at the University with a handful of colleagues, we decided to work out a effective tool for such a problem contributing to achieve a viable solution. Hence, we formed a team of researchers and engineers and together we designed and developed a sustainable sailing drone suitable for long missions, extreme weather conditions and a possibly everlasting power supply.The drone is environmentally sustainable, since its control systems are powered with solar energy and uses wind as unique propulsion system: features that avoid the adverse effects caused by thermal, acoustic or electromagnetic emissions; in case of malfunction the drone has a negligible impact on the environment in terms of polluting residues.  “Autonomous” means that it is able to plan and enact all the necessary sailing decisions and reach the objective, as using sail upwind.The drone has been designed, trying to keep low its production costs and be as small as possible so that it can be effectively used in various conditions and different applications, linked to the ability to manage a intelligent drone fleet able to perform coordinated monitoring missions. Since 2010 a fierce competition for autonomously sailing boats has been afoot, with the final aim of sailing the Atlantic Ocean coast to coast: the Microtransat challenge; up to now no one has successfully achieved it yet, leading people to consider such challenge as “the Mount Everest” of the autonomous sailing panorama. In order to demonstrate the reliability and the potential of our drone we want to reach such an achievement following the so called “Columbus Route”.The advertising campaign video has been realised at the beginning of 2018 in Venice, in the following months we introduced the jib, developed the innovative sail locking system and optimised the guidance algorithms linked with the newly designed configuration.Together we can change the world. What makes our drone unique is its versatility related to the possible world’s changing applications. You too can be part of our first of its kind project. Even a small contribution could help us altogether to reach huge achievements.The funds we are trying to collect are destined to the boat completion (we are lacking electrical, mechanical components), its shipment to Las Palmas - Canary Islands,  where it will set sail to America and satellite communication needed to receive the telemetry during the journey.The more we get the more we can doIf we reach our goal, given the nature of the project, we'll keep the campaign up because any further help will be useful for the improvement and implementation of some new innovative systems, the realization of further drones and the development of new sensors for deep dive analysis.Further developmentAnalysing environmental data, we have found various critical issues in the current storage and distribution methods. In fact a unique way to recover data with a single procedure does not exist. This constitutes an obstacle for the research world and does not allow the prevision of future meaningful events.In order to provide all the required data we plan to create a monitoring network based on the Distributed Ledger technology where other land sensors could contribute to the certified dataset. Using blockchain tech we would have always at hand the time series set safe.Here are some potential applications:
Sending a global weather alert to the population along the coasts in case of tsunami or other extreme events
Opportunity to integrate the whole data-set in order to verify actual climate change
Analysis of the areas with the highest density of microplastics and polluting agents
Evaluation or various weather prevision models, increasing their reliability, especially the one linked to single event forecast
Optimization of marine infrastructures
The solution we are proposing is composed by three layers:
Physical: of drones and earth weather stations;
 Infrastructural: of a network of nodes composing the blockchain. 
Interface: of all storage and withdrawal of data to and fro certified dataset on the network by agencies.
At the moment blockchain technology is ready to acquire and manage the data flux for the IOT.If you are interested further developing this project and/or buying our sea drone, please contact us. MagicBoat has been published in  ASME magazine:Pugi, L., Allotta, B., Boni, E., Guidi, F., Montagni, M., Massai, T.

Less Consumption, Less Emission   Lumir K converts the small thermal energy of cooking oil into electricity and it turns on the bright LEDs. This amazing lantern will light up where you want and it make an impact on the world where it is needed.     From now,Cooking oil turns to the power source of your lamp. Lumir K uses cooking oil to generate electricity.Cooking oil is one of the cheapest and familiar ingredients as it is easily found from grocery stores in the city to tiny kiosk shops in a remote area.Olive, canola and sunflower oil, it doesn't matter what kind of cooking oil is. Without any batteries or external power supply, only with tiny flame which is as big as candle, Lumir K gives you an instant and 100 times brighter light.   Lumir K is an easy, accessible and sustainable solution for those who need a light.With a goal to light up the world, team Lumir had a successful campaign with our first product, candle powered LED lamp.We promised to keep developing solutions for families in the off-grid area and finally came back with Lumir K by improving efficiency and changing fuel as cooking oil.Lumir K achieved CE and its core technology is patented. We are happy to share this achievement with you, and we need your support to take one step further.Lumir K will brighten up anywhere light needs to touch. Lumir has been resolving the light shortages and delivering the beauty of light.Our journey started from a small but momentous experience during the trip to India, learning that there are so many places around the world suffering from unreliable or no electricity supply.Among 1.2 billion who do not have access to electricity, most of them rely on candles or kerosene lamps which is dark, harmful for health and the environment. Using kerosene lamps indoors has the same effect as smoking 40 cigarettes and the cost for fuel takes up even 30% of the household's income. Instead of unreliable supply,Isn't it be possible to maximize the light from a candle or a kerosene lamp? That was the question that led us to invent Lumir K as an effective solution for the light shortage issue.In the case of kerosene lamps, only 10% of the energy from the fuel is used for illuminating because the flame itself is the direct light, and the rest, 90% of the energy is just scattered in the air as a heat. However, Lumir K harnesses the wasted 90% of the heat energy to turn on the LEDs, so it is pretty economical as it provides a brighter light only with a small flame. LUMIR K can be used anytime and anywhere while solar lamps has a big weather constraints in many areas like Indonesia where the average rainy days are more than 160 days.  After our first crowdfunding campaign, we became a partner of KOICA, Korean International Cooperation Agency, and Lumir K was piloted in Indonesia.Lumir K provides 4.1 times brighter light than kerosene lamps, while its economic effect was also achieved with 80% lower fuel consumption compared to kerosene lamps. It also reduces carbon emissions by about 90%.  Click on the image to get cash rewards for pledges from your own referral link!      Lumir K harnesses the heat energy of a small flame which usually scattered into the air and generate electricity. Without any external power supply, it lights up LEDs which is almost 100 times brighter than a candlelight.   Just placing the lamp over the lit wick will turn the LED light on. Lumir K is powered cooking oil, which is easy to get and is affordable wherever you are. It consumes only 5ml of oil for an hour, as much as you might spill when you cook. It means that you can light up Lumir K for 1 month with 1 liter of oil. You can enjoy the sustainable light of Lumir K for 10 years. It doesn't take up a lot of space when you keep it under the sink or on the shelf in the garage, however, it has a great value when you use it. Not only Lumir K comes in handy for you, also it provides the light of hope to people without access to electricity in a remote area. Your support will make the impact bigger.     BBQ in the garden  In your garage  Prep for blackout  Camping  Picnic      Detachable light   Adjustable LED head   1 fill up = 7 daysThe fuel container can hold up to 140ml.It is enough to light up the lamp for a week when you use 4 hours every day.     2cm is enough for the size of a flame. Making a flame bigger than that is not recommended.*Lumir K is designed to use cooking oil as fuel. Avoid using other fuels like gasoline, which is explosive and highly flammable.

All of our products are designed to be self-contained and compact. All you have to remember to bring is the GoSun Fusion - All-in-One Solar + Electric Oven, your favorite foods to cook and some utensils.  
 
 For five years, GoSun has pioneered and refined the cleanest cooking possible. Our success is attributed to space-aged, solar thermal technology called 'evacuated tubes' or 'vacuum tubes'. These tough glass tubes seal in a high-vacuum creating unbelievable insulation so the sun's radiation can be harnessed like never before.  
 
 This Time Lapse Video shows the Fusion In Action:
Step 1: solar oven getting a big meal started
Step 2: sun sets and the PowerBank is plugged in
Step 3: guests and host get lost in great conversation
Step 4: electric heater finishes the chicken and vegetables
Step 5: someone remembers the hot and juicy meal left in the Fusion
Step 6: yummmmmmy...
Here is a simple timelapse of how it cooks into the night...  
 The GoSun Fusion integrates a 150 Watt heating element (equivalent power draw of an incandescent lightbulb) below the stainless steel Cook Tray, allowing for cooking anytime, combining reliability and portability that has never been possible with solar or electric ovens.When the sun goes down, you're in luck. Plug it in, flip the switch and the magic continues...  
 
 The Fusion’s Hybrid Solar + Electric Technology enables cooking anywhere, anytime thanks to the oven's vacuum tube, known for its advanced thermal performance. Five times more efficient than a normal oven cook meals with the energy needed to power a lightbulb.Portable and rugged, GoSun lets you cook in more scenarios than ever before with out a drop of fuel. 
We want you to share.  The GoSun Fusion is optimized to bring your family a bang for the hard-earned buck.  The 3.2 liter Cook Tray cooks plenty of food for five full meals. We think of it as our mid-sized sedan (a hybrid, of course); after years of development, we found the sweet spot between weight, durability and cost.   
 
                                                                  ""It's like cooking in a Thermos, but you have to see it to believe it."" - Wayne Didier, GoSun Customer 
 
 A solar oven that transforms into the most efficient oven ever; the Fusion is game-changing.  Outdoor cooking has always required burning and the drama that comes with fire.  Electric is clean, reliable and safe, but before the Fusion you had to bring a generator to make enough power when cooking off-grid.

How to Power the GoSun Fusion? If you’re out of power and sunlight, the GoSun Fusion can be powered from anything that can provide 150 Watts at 12 Volt. This includes 12 Volt Outlets or Power Source from carport jacks (cigarette lighter port), boat or RV battery and much more*.A perfect way to power your GoSun Fusion Hybrid Electric Cooking is with the optional, lithium-ion battery powerbank. The two pound powerbank allows for up to one hour of off-grid cooking power. Just recharge your powerbank with the provided AC adapter (wall plug) after your adventure and you’re ready to do it all over again; or recharge the powerbank with the optional 20 Watt solar panel to remain completely off-grid. 
You may be wondering why efficiency matters. We can explain.  The Fusion is the world's first portable, electric oven to work off-grid.  For example, instead of 1,500 Watts used by your toaster oven, the Fusion consumes 150 Watts, or 1/10th the power.  Run side by side, with the same meal inside, the GoSun Fusion is off the charts when compared to the status quo.  
 
 This is only possible with ultra-efficiency:
Reduce Power Consumption - you'd need a generator for most ovens
Reduce Weight - less power to fuel the oven, means less stuff to carry
Retain Heat and Moisture - meals stay hot and juicy for hours thanks to vacuum insulation and high-temp. silicone seals
Off-Grid - the Fusion can be powered by a PowerBank that fits in your pocket
 
 With all this capability, we want you to take it with you, anywhere the road may lead. So we designed a rugged bag that fits everything and provides some cushion on the long haul.  Keep your mess kit stored in the bag and you're ready to cook out anytime.  Without the bag, the Fusion is easily moved and carried via molded handles.

                                                                               Shipping Logistics and Referral Rewards Program:All backers will be charged the minimum for shipping.  GoSun does not make money on shipping, rather passing along the cost to each backer depending on location. International backers should know that we have not included the entire shipping cost to cover VAT's, taxes and duties.  We have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. For this reason, the shipping cost does not cover VAT's but only covers cost of delivery to the address provided. GoSun may require additional fees before delivery.  
  
 
 GoSun will provide access to additional accessories to support other power sources such as an AC Wall Socket or 12 Volt battery.  The items selected will be shared with Backers when closer to fulfillment.   
 Cooking under full sun is always nice with a solar cooker, but GoSun operates under a wide range of conditions; cloudy, freezing, muggy, snowing, windy, dusty, you name it, nothing is off limits.  Now, with the electric heater, the cooking never ends.Use the table below as a reference when preparing a meal to share.  The factors of weather, meal size, food density and moisture content make a big difference.  Once you get started cooking with GoSun, you will be amazed.    
 
 GoSun is trying to be as realistic as possible with our longest project timeline ever. We will not be sitting on our hands or going quiet on our Backers.We've made a lot of happy customers over the past five years but we are still small and cutting our teeth on the bleeding edge of solar technology.  If you can take the extra two minutes to share this campaign with your friends, family and co-workers it would truly help.   
 
              For comparison, the other products GoSun has launched and built with the help of Indiegogo are exclusively solar powered.  If the GoSun Go is a Scooter, the GoSun Sport is a Sports Car and the GoSun Grill is a Family Van, then the GoSun Fusion is our new Hybrid Sedan.  GoSun is bringing change to those who need it most.

When you bring nature inside you’re improving your indoor environment, removing toxins and purifying the air around you.As we got older, we started to become more aware of the harsher realities of our world, realizing that there are many people globally who face food and water shortages every day but that for most of us, such issues are so foreign.We couldn't ignore the facts, so we decided to use our knowledge of aquariums to find a feasible solution.We believe aquaponics is a clear solution to many of the food and water shortages humanity faces today. While this food production method was used thousands of years ago in early Aztec and Chinese civilizations, it has since fallen into disuse and become largely forgotten.We hope to educate as many people as possible about the practical solution and beauty of aquaponics and to ultimately help initiate the process of bringing aquaponics to the forefront of today's agriculture.We were able to reach many with the original EcoQube & EcoQube C, and now, we hope to reach even more with the EcoQube C+!

Until now, most portable stoves require you to carry bulky bags of charcoal or canisters of propane gas. With SolSource Sport, you can take it with you to camping trips, beach barbecues and tailgating parties without the need to carry fuel - all you need is sunshine. There is no residual charcoal or empty canisters when you are done cooking.</p>

<h3>What is Glow?</h3>
<p>Glow is the world’s first ambient home energy tracker that anyone can install. Using breakthrough magneto-resistive sensing technology, Glow’s sensor wirelessly measures your home’s electricity usage. Glow sends that information to an elegantly designed, in-home display unit so you can “see” your home’s energy usage. It’s like a fitness tracker for your home!</p>
<h3>Where does it Go?</h3>
<p>Our first challenge was getting the real-time data you need to see. Up until now, you had to do this:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506531706/ack9l0hg6p2z0xpf3nco.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Want to put your hands in there?</p>
<p>Didn’t think so. And a good call too, that’s the most electrically dangerous spot in your home.</p>
<p>So we created Glow’s sensor. It installs like this:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7aCYvh25q1jy6eNq/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Glow's in-home unit can be placed anywhere in your home. We like to put ours in the living room or kitchen.</p>

<h3>Why does it Glow?</h3>
<p>Our lives are busy, kilowatt-hours are confusing, and graphs take time to read. <strong>So we use the fastest, most intuitive communication medium: color.</strong> Color is well studied; it’s lightning quick to understand and is more effective than graphs or numbers throughout day-to-day life. It's also understandable at all ages making <strong>Glow a place the whole family can learn about energy use. </strong></p>
<p>We’ve found through testing that users respond best to a range of colors that go from cool (blue and green) to hot (amber, orange, and red). A glance on your way out the door lets you make sure you’re not wasting energy while you’re away. And <strong>when you want numbers and graphs, Glow’s app is just a few taps away.</strong></p>

<h3>Get peace of mind with mobile alerts</h3>
<p>Did you <strong>forget to turn off the oven</strong>, is a space heater <strong>running in an empty room</strong>, or <strong>the curling iron still on?</strong> There are devices in our homes that shouldn't be left running unattended. No need to worry though--now you can find out right from your phone. The Glow app lets you check your home’s energy usage when you're on-the-go. Even better, <strong>notifications alert you of abnormal usage</strong> patterns so you can take action right away. No more nasty surprises at home or on your electricity bill!</p>

<p><i><strong>""Glow keeps me informed about what’s going on with my electricity usage at every moment, and guests think it’s a decoration, so it serves as a good conversation piece, as well!""</strong></i> - Jordan F.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Save money on your electric bill</h3>
<p>In most homes, a whopping <strong>40% of electricity consumed goes to waste</strong>. That can add up to big bucks on your electric bill—over <strong>$500 wasted per year for the average home!</strong> Glow helps you see energy use as it happens so you can cut the waste and save money. This means Glow will pay for itself in a year or less in most homes. You can even tell Glow how much you want to spend each month, and Glow will help you stay on track. </p>
<p>Research shows that when you get real-time feedback on your energy use--like Glow's color indicator--<strong>it leads to up to 20% reduction in overall energy usage.</strong></p>
<p><i><strong>""Glow took the guesswork out of figuring out our electric bill. When an appliance is running, I get automatic feedback.""</strong></i> -- Natalie W.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506532128/ryjebkarhpztnv4lbg4o.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Here are just a few examples of waste that Glow can help you track down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inefficient/second refrigerator: <strong>$300/year</strong>
</li>
<li>Continuously running dehumidifier: <strong>$250/year</strong>
</li>
<li>Water heater oversetting: <strong>$60/year</strong>
</li>
<li>Poorly sized HVAC system: <strong>$200-600/year</strong>
</li>
<li>Unreplaced incandescent bulb: <strong>$5-$15/year</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Environmental Impact</strong></h3>
<p>Generation of electricity is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US, responsible for 29% of American emissions. According to the EPA, an average home's wasted electricity is equivalent to 3.4 tons of carbon emissions annually. Obtaining the fuel needed for electricity generation has an environmental cost as well. When you reduce your energy usage, in addition to reducing your utility bills, it helps to minimize your impact on the environment.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>We've designed Glow to be a device you love to use. Here are some of the features we added to help it not only help you save energy, but also fit nicely into your home:</p>

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p><strong>The Short Story:</strong> Glow tracks your home’s energy usage using two devices: a wireless sensor that attaches to the outside of your utility meter box, and the in-home unit which plugs into your wall. The sensor measures electricity as it flows into your home, and the in-home unit sends that information to the Glow app on your phone. When you get real-time feedback, research shows that you'll begin to optimize your usage. But we take it a step further and add notifications, summaries, and budgeting goals to give you additional tools to <strong>maximize your savings and safety.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506532487/dvpbgzvtgojggyhqwou2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>The Longer Story: </strong></p>
<p>Traditional energy monitors required dangerous wiring or professional installation. As a result, every homeowner we knew was left in the dark about their daily energy use. </p>
<p>Our team of designers, engineers, and developers set out to measure electricity usage without having to open any dangerous electrical boxes. To do that, we invented a self-contained sensor that attaches to the outside of your electricity meter box and “senses” the amount of electricity flowing into your home. This type of magneto-resistive sensing was first popularized for consumer use in smartphones, where it is used to detect the magnetic field of the earth for the compass app.</p>
<p>Glow’s sensor sends energy data wirelessly to the Glow unit in your home. From there, it is processed and sent to Glow’s backend cloud service for deeper analysis. </p>

<h3>Risks and challenges </h3>
<p>We've done a huge amount of work to reduce the risk of getting Glow to your door. Most importantly, we've been testing our third generation of prototypes for over 9 months in real-world homes. These units are part of a long line of prototypes for both the design and the hardware. We've also built Glow for manufacturability from day 1--we've been building custom PCBs, done detailed costing, and found second sources for component suppliers all along the way. This means we don't have to convert from a hobby-solution prototype (like a Raspberry Pi) to custom hardware, we've already built it. We're also building strong partnerships with multiple manufacturing resources in the region. It's important to note that they're a car ride away in most cases, instead of an intercontinental flight to the other side of the world. These partnerships give us confidence that our goals of manufacturing in the US, and regionally when possible, are on track to turn out a great product.</p>
<p>- As with any wireless device, Glow must be certified to meet the specifications of the FCC. Although we design and test to these specifications, when Glow is sent off to a certifying lab, issues could be uncovered that may lead to design changes that lead to longer than anticipated time to fulfillment.</p>
<p>- The upgraded wood base poses a unique engineering challenge due to its inherent qualities as a natural material. Wood undergoes seasonal expansion and contraction, requires an increased minimum thickness, and has reduced cross grain impact strength. All of these factors must be mitigated with additional industrial design and engineering. However, we deeply love wood--both how it feels and how it augments home decor. We are working hard to deliver it as a unique and beautiful addition to the base product. If for any reason the wood base is significantly delayed or undeliverable due to these risks, we will offer a standard unit instead, at a reduced cost.</p>
<p>- Any integration with 3rd party devices is in some part dependent on that third party. We can not control access to APIs or other integration points, and any features involving outside entities may be delayed or become impossible based on those third party entities' decisions. If this happens, we'll attempt to communicate with affected customers as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>- While we are ready to launch Glow into the world, we have not, by any means, solved every challenge ahead of us. In launching this Kickstarter campaign we are setting our sights on delivering a great first product to a group of amazing early adopters and supporters. However, to get Glow to your doorstep we have hardware and software engineering ahead of us, additional industrial design, formalizing relationships with identified manufacturing partners, and, finally, the task of manufacturing, testing and fulfilling all of your rewards. Our intention is to communicate throughout this journey on a roughly monthly basis and be as frank and open as possible with you as we tackle each challenge ahead of us.</p>

</div></div>","What is Glow?
Glow is the world’s first ambient home energy tracker that anyone can install. Using breakthrough magneto-resistive sensing technology, Glow’s sensor wirelessly measures your home’s electricity usage. Glow sends that information to an elegantly designed, in-home display unit so you can “see” your home’s energy usage. It’s like a fitness tracker for your home!
Where does it Go?
Our first challenge was getting the real-time data you need to see. Up until now, you had to do this:

Want to put your hands in there?
Didn’t think so. And a good call too, that’s the most electrically dangerous spot in your home.
So we created Glow’s sensor. It installs like this:

Glow's in-home unit can be placed anywhere in your home. We like to put ours in the living room or kitchen.



Why does it Glow?
Our lives are busy, kilowatt-hours are confusing, and graphs take time to read. So we use the fastest, most intuitive communication medium: color. Color is well studied; it’s lightning quick to understand and is more effective than graphs or numbers throughout day-to-day life. It's also understandable at all ages making Glow a place the whole family can learn about energy use. 
We’ve found through testing that users respond best to a range of colors that go from cool (blue and green) to hot (amber, orange, and red). A glance on your way out the door lets you make sure you’re not wasting energy while you’re away. And when you want numbers and graphs, Glow’s app is just a few taps away.

As electricity use increases in your house, Glow changes color, giving you intuitive knowledge about your usage
 

Get peace of mind with mobile alerts
Did you forget to turn off the oven, is a space heater running in an empty room, or the curling iron still on? There are devices in our homes that shouldn't be left running unattended. No need to worry though--now you can find out right from your phone. The Glow app lets you check your home’s energy usage when you're on-the-go. Even better, notifications alert you of abnormal usage patterns so you can take action right away. No more nasty surprises at home or on your electricity bill!

""Glow keeps me informed about what’s going on with my electricity usage at every moment, and guests think it’s a decoration, so it serves as a good conversation piece, as well!"" - Jordan F.

Save money on your electric bill
In most homes, a whopping 40% of electricity consumed goes to waste. That can add up to big bucks on your electric bill—over $500 wasted per year for the average home! Glow helps you see energy use as it happens so you can cut the waste and save money. This means Glow will pay for itself in a year or less in most homes. You can even tell Glow how much you want to spend each month, and Glow will help you stay on track. 
Research shows that when you get real-time feedback on your energy use--like Glow's color indicator--it leads to up to 20% reduction in overall energy usage.
""Glow took the guesswork out of figuring out our electric bill. When an appliance is running, I get automatic feedback."" -- Natalie W.

Here are just a few examples of waste that Glow can help you track down:

Inefficient/second refrigerator: $300/year

Continuously running dehumidifier: $250/year

Water heater oversetting: $60/year

Poorly sized HVAC system: $200-600/year

Unreplaced incandescent bulb: $5-$15/year


Environmental Impact
Generation of electricity is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the US, responsible for 29% of American emissions. According to the EPA, an average home's wasted electricity is equivalent to 3.4 tons of carbon emissions annually. Obtaining the fuel needed for electricity generation has an environmental cost as well. When you reduce your energy usage, in addition to reducing your utility bills, it helps to minimize your impact on the environment.

<p>I'm Arsheen, Materials Scientist and Engineer and student at Duke's Fuqua School of Business. This campaign was created to expose you to the incredible feat of Graphene, a one-atom thick layer of carbon, with remarkable properties in countless industries, including clean tech, aerospace, water desalination, structural materials, display screens and drug delivery, just to name a few. This revolutionary material is a million times thinner than paper, an excellent conductor of heat and electricity, 200 times stronger than structural steel, and yet flexible!</p>
<h3>More About Graphene:</h3>
<p>Graphene was discovered in 2004 and there has only been a decade of research, placing it at a relatively young stage for materials science. The current method of Graphene production involves a high-energy input to break apart sheets of carbon from the compact carbon source, and harsh chemicals - terrible for the environment. Furthermore, the production process has a low yield of 10-20% and large-scale production solutions have not been resolved due to the aforementioned economic and source material constraints. Companies such as Apple, Samsung, IBM, Xerox, Sony, Lockheed Martin and Saab are pouring millions of dollars into R&amp;D and all competing to file patents for Graphene related technologies they have developed, such as flexible touch screens for tablets and phones. However, these products are not yet commercially viable, due, again, to the cost of production. As a result, currently most of the market for Graphene is not in the commercial sector.</p>
<p>Until now. </p>
<h3>Confused? No worries, here’s the summary:</h3>
<p>Graphene, at the end of the day, is nothing but one atom layer of carbon. An incredibly complicated and hard to produce layer, but just one beautiful layer of carbon nonetheless. And we have figured out how to make it without all the hoopla.</p>
<p>At GO Leaf, we have dedicated our lives to researching carbon as a human-friendly alternative to the modern, industrial world. Carbon is all around us, we’re just learning to harness it. We have discovered a way to economically and ecologically produce a material that has the ability to be a game-changer for SO many industries. The funding from this project will allow us to take to market our Graphene cell, which will transform solar energy as we know it today and continue innovating to develop more Graphene-based products a reality for consumers like you and I!</p>
<h3><strong>How did we get here?</strong></h3>
<p><br/><strong>Believe it or not, we stumbled upon it. </strong>Keep reading if you are really curious how this all happened!</p>
<p>It all started when my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer. Watching her body wrecked by chemo was really hard on my family. My father, a chemist by education, felt there HAD to be a better way of delivering drugs to the human body. And that’s how he started exploring carbon as a drug delivery mechanism.</p>
<p>Fast-forward several years, intellectual tangents, and painstakingly slow R&amp;D cycles and, well, here we are.  </p>
<p>Now, I say we, because, make no mistake about it, this is a family affair.</p>
<p>My dad,  Abdul, is the person that tirelessly forged the partnerships with the scientists and academics that laid the foundation for all the work that we are doing. My sister, Afreen, biochemist and microbiologist, is the person that developed a way to encapsulate a drug in a carbon casing that can pass the blood brain barrier and release it upon arrival, making targeted drug delivery possible, meaning treat cancer without damaging healthy cells throughout the body.</p>
<p>While my older sister and dad were focused on using carbon to solve medical issues, I was interested in how carbon nanotechnology enabled products could be used to address other major social issues, namely, the need for clean water. My first company, CNanoz, does just that.</p>
<p>This new company, GO Leaf, is just the latest (AND GREATEST!) iteration on all the research and development our family has done with carbon, focused on tackling the need for clean energy.</p>
<p>And so, here we are. Thanks to Grandma.</p>

<p>This is a small prototype of our Graphene cell. It is a stand alone cell, not connected to any battery or power source and it is able to successfully power the light bulb. Note also, that this image is indoors, thus demonstrating our Graphene cell does not need direct sunlight to generate power, unlike traditional silicon-based solar panels. Our Graphene cell generates power 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, without the need for a power source or sunlight. Because it does not need direct sunlight, it can generate power even in the night, and can be stacked on top of one another, resulting in tremendous savings in land costs that solar farms require.</p>

Install Legion Solar virtually anywhere.  Legion Solar is designed for anybody with any skill level to setup. It's that simple!Legion Solar works with your existing rate program to simply drive your consumption down. The result is simply a lowered electric bill.You're also less likely to get charged the higher rates because you're less likely to enter into the higher priced tiers.We created SolarRegulator™, an artificial intelligence computer to contain generated energy behind your meter where the utility company does not own. Energy production of each Micro-Inverter is controlled so that energy production is less than or equal to energy consumption allowing you to generate your own electricity unrestricted.Utility company only sees less consumption from you, not a grid tied solar system. As a result, it is not necessary to seek interconnection permission pertaining to utility company approved grid-tied solar systems.  We took all the short comings of traditional solar systems and designed a game changing new solution to outperform. As you become familiar with Legion Solar, size up your system in stages. The larger the system, the more you'll offset and the more you'll save.  
 Stage 1 - Get familiar with Legion Solar and it's components with the Starter Set. Sets up in minutes and experience instant results.

<h2>By supplying clean water, Sulis transforms lives.</h2>
<p>Sulis is a simple and innovative technology for water sanitation. In many parts of the world, clean water is a luxury that cannot be taken for granted. Water scarcity is a global issue that affects more than 40% of the world population today. Collectively, women and children spend 140 million hours daily collecting water, which does not even account for the time that they spend each day cleaning that water. Collecting and cleaning water takes time away from work, school, and caring for family, which locks families in a cycle of poverty. In addition to the economic and safety risks, health is a serious concern. It is devastating to consider that over a thousand children die from a preventable water-related disease every day. There is a desperate need for a safer, more reliable way to access clean water. We need a solution that allows people to clean the contaminated water they do have available.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525717651/i7o5ehrfp1dteknglwrd.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Sulis is the solution. We have developed a groundbreaking technology that harnesses the power of sunlight to clean water. Sulis is affordable, sustainably produced, and effective at generating potable water without depending on infrastructure. Our technology eliminates pathogens from the water source, drastically improving the health and wellbeing of those without naturally safe water. By giving individuals the ability to easily clean the water they have nearby with only solar energy, Sulis saves users those long hours collecting the wood and buying the kerosene needed to boil their water. This enables people to stay in school and at work for more hours, gives them the freedom to start their own businesses, and allows them to improve their own standard of living, rather than depending on others. In essence, Sulis does more than provide clean water, it empowers. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To start manufacturing the Sulis devices and get them to our partners in India, Haiti, and Puerto Rico, we need $20,000 to finalize our research and development. This step is essential in ensuring that Sulis meets all global health standards of water sanitization and that our design is as intuitive as possible.</p>
<p>This summer, we are headed as a team to India to run our pilot program, where we will be establishing relationships in the region, testing our latest prototype on site, and ensuring cultural fit. The only way water solutions succeed is through real cultural adoption, and that can only happen by working closely with the communities we intend to serve.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525717708/ds6dnyvbhjq7nl4s4pwf.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Your gift will have lasting impact. Contributing to Sulis now will ensure the longevity of this life-saving tool. All donations will go towards running our pilot program and bringing Sulis into the hands of those suffering from lack of access to clean water.</p>
<p>And in exchange for a gift, you get perks! See the sidebar for what you get if you donate a gift of $5, $10, $20, $75, $150, $300, $1000, or $2500.</p>
<h3>The Design</h3>
<p>Sulis is designed to be sustainably produced, affordable, and effective at generating potable water - the very same water that is so desperately needed for drinking, bathing, and irrigating fields.</p>
<p>Our device uses reflectors to concentrate solar radiation into the container of water, where it then interacts with a metal catalyst to sanitize the water. Our current model sanitizes 12 liters of water in 7 hours, the minimum amount that the average individual in a developing country needs for their entire daily use.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525728251/tc0k3dcapsikfohextoq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The reflected sunlight shines on the catalyst and excites electrons in the oxide layer. The excited electrons then react with the water to produce free radicals, which kill the pathogens and break down harmful organic compounds. Once the process is complete, the user is left with clean water. No waste is produced and there are no parts that need to be replaced.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525717820/b5jsg74tef80nj5pj1dx.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By donating to Sulis, you will make a difference in someone's life. Through harnessing solar energy, we use 7 times less energy than electric sterilizers and 1000 times less energy than that needed to boil water.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525717849/j8awdmu5n6wc8q2ik7s5.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>By not relying on gas or electricity, Sulis fundamentally transforms the energy usage of households in developing nations. People can conserve the time, money, and energy that they would have used trying to clean their water, and instead focus on long-term goals such as healthcare, education, and agriculture.</p>

In fact Vaporjets will just leave a trail of warm water vapor in their wake. In the future Vaporjets will take you from place to place as you go about your daily life. You will request a pickup where you are and a Vaporjet will hover down and land nearby. As you climb in you tell it where to take you and when you are comfortably inside the Vaporjet will whisk you through the air straight to your destination under pilotless control, like a driverless car - but in 3D. Traffic jams will begin to become a thing of the past.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506474614/xlv8wv9otodrahnmnave.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Vaporjets will use fuel which is easily produced from sunlight and water, even at your home, with a solar powered water splitter.</p><p>That is just the beginning… a vaporjet has its thrusters on its nose... pointing sideways, and on its roof for lift! That’s weird... but computer simulations show Vacupulsion will work, and provide big benefits: like none of the dust storms created by helicopters or big quadcopters; and reduction of drag and noise.</p><p>Before we actually make a prototype vaporjet, we need to do detailed design work to find the most efficient design. We want your help to make this design work a reality, and to keep vacupulsion in the hands of people who want to see it succeed.</p><p>Want to see how vacupulsion works? Watch the video now. There is a lot of information so you may want to watch it more than once and use the pause button!</p><h2><strong>A Moving Story</strong></h2><p>I was born into a family obsessed for two centuries with transport. My great great grandfather arrived in Australia around 1820 and created a horse stud near Melbourne. He supplied horses to the Army when horses were the fastest way to go. They bred race horses and built a racecourse in Melbourne.</p><p>When the first motor cars appeared around 1900 my great grandfather built one of the first motor racing tracks in the world, complete with cambered corners. He staged and won the first motor race on it. My grandfather was a pilot in World War One, and my father flew and built aircraft and became a leader in aviation in Australia. My brothers build aircraft and racing cars too.</p><p>I was designing and building simple rockets when I was ten and would tell curious adults that I wanted to be an aeronautical engineer, and wondered why they chuckled. I became an electrical engineer and did a master's in AI, but couldn't stop thinking about aircraft and spacecraft. I just love physics, engineering, renewable energy, tinkering, and thinking about flight, including spaceflight.</p><p>In the 90's I became particularly interested in airships (eg. Zeppelins) because of their ability to lift without consuming much energy. Unfortunately they cannot be made very streamlined because they have to be filled with a lot of helium or hydrogen. The bulging shape results in air resistance or 'drag' severely limiting their speed and energy efficiency.</p><h2><strong>The Eureka Moment</strong></h2><p>There are strange elements of this story that you can only read in my ebooklet; but to keep the story short...</p><p>I was on a winter holiday trip camping in the Australian tropics. I woke one morning thinking about faster airships… removing air from their path... using water vapor explosions in front of the airship... that then imploded via condensation. That was the intellectual seed that sprouted into Vacupulsion. My head started to spin as visions of a fantastic new future flooded in!</p><p>I soon saw the potential for using jets of water vapor directed over specially curved surfaces to generate lift. That sort of thing was already done sometimes using jet exhaust gas on wings. I had not heard of exhaust gases being used at the nose of a craft. The opportunity of simultaneously reducing drag while increasing thrust using a non-polluting gas appealed to me.</p><h3><strong>Information for Nerds (skip this section if you are Cool)</strong></h3><p>A preliminary unoptimised vacupulsion configuration resulted in simulated lift of 8 kg/m2 with a 10 mm wide slit-nozzle, vapor speed of 250 m/s (non-tangential jet), and an aerofoil with a 1 m chord. This lift is sufficient for an ultralight craft, and significant increases in lift can be expected with optimisation of various design parameters.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506310089/bizy9ck2z5xuqgukfrg0.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Water vapor is a strong greenhouse gas, but it has a half life of only nine days in the atmosphere, so it does not accumulate and trigger climate disruption, unlike carbon dioxide. There is something very special about using water vapor in Vacupulsion: water vapor begins to condense at one hundred degrees Celsius (at sea level), and sudden condensation creates a pressure drop. This is a source of power in storm supercells and has potential to add power to Vacupulsion processes. Another unexplored source of lift is the potential for formation of a warm toroidal vortex (like a smoke ring) above a hovering vaporjet.</p><h3><strong>Why we are Raising Money and our Budget Breakdown.</strong></h3><p>The most important thing to be aware of is that the enormously expensive and time consuming task of prototyping and testing Is now usually replaced with computer based simulation and 3D design. Simulation information allows the first prototype to have a good chance of success.</p><p>We will not jump in and make ad hoc improvised prototypes that are likely to be very inefficient or inoperable. We will do a careful investigation, using computer simulation software apps, to see how various important factors or parameters affect the efficiency of Vacupulsion. (Parametric Analysis). That will be the first 3 phases of development of a vaporjet. We think that the minimum cost of doing Phases 1, 2 and 3 will total $100,000 and 4,000 hours of engineering R&amp;D work.</p><table><tbody>

</div></div>","Most Important InformationVaporjets are being designed to provide transport that does not cost the Earth. In fact Vaporjets will just leave a trail of warm water vapor in their wake. In the future Vaporjets will take you from place to place as you go about your daily life. You will request a pickup where you are and a Vaporjet will hover down and land nearby. As you climb in you tell it where to take you and when you are comfortably inside the Vaporjet will whisk you through the air straight to your destination under pilotless control, like a driverless car - but in 3D. Traffic jams will begin to become a thing of the past.Vaporjets will use fuel which is easily produced from sunlight and water, even at your home, with a solar powered water splitter.That is just the beginning… a vaporjet has its thrusters on its nose... pointing sideways, and on its roof for lift! That’s weird... but computer simulations show Vacupulsion will work, and provide big benefits: like none of the dust storms created by helicopters or big quadcopters; and reduction of drag and noise.Before we actually make a prototype vaporjet, we need to do detailed design work to find the most efficient design. We want your help to make this design work a reality, and to keep vacupulsion in the hands of people who want to see it succeed.Want to see how vacupulsion works? Watch the video now. There is a lot of information so you may want to watch it more than once and use the pause button!A Moving StoryI was born into a family obsessed for two centuries with transport. My great great grandfather arrived in Australia around 1820 and created a horse stud near Melbourne. He supplied horses to the Army when horses were the fastest way to go. They bred race horses and built a racecourse in Melbourne.When the first motor cars appeared around 1900 my great grandfather built one of the first motor racing tracks in the world, complete with cambered corners. He staged and won the first motor race on it. My grandfather was a pilot in World War One, and my father flew and built aircraft and became a leader in aviation in Australia. My brothers build aircraft and racing cars too.I was designing and building simple rockets when I was ten and would tell curious adults that I wanted to be an aeronautical engineer, and wondered why they chuckled. I became an electrical engineer and did a master's in AI, but couldn't stop thinking about aircraft and spacecraft. I just love physics, engineering, renewable energy, tinkering, and thinking about flight, including spaceflight.In the 90's I became particularly interested in airships (eg. Zeppelins) because of their ability to lift without consuming much energy. Unfortunately they cannot be made very streamlined because they have to be filled with a lot of helium or hydrogen. The bulging shape results in air resistance or 'drag' severely limiting their speed and energy efficiency.The Eureka MomentThere are strange elements of this story that you can only read in my ebooklet; but to keep the story short...I was on a winter holiday trip camping in the Australian tropics. I woke one morning thinking about faster airships… removing air from their path... using water vapor explosions in front of the airship... that then imploded via condensation. That was the intellectual seed that sprouted into Vacupulsion. My head started to spin as visions of a fantastic new future flooded in!I soon saw the potential for using jets of water vapor directed over specially curved surfaces to generate lift. That sort of thing was already done sometimes using jet exhaust gas on wings. I had not heard of exhaust gases being used at the nose of a craft. The opportunity of simultaneously reducing drag while increasing thrust using a non-polluting gas appealed to me.Information for Nerds (skip this section if you are Cool)A preliminary unoptimised vacupulsion configuration resulted in simulated lift of 8 kg/m2 with a 10 mm wide slit-nozzle, vapor speed of 250 m/s (non-tangential jet), and an aerofoil with a 1 m chord. This lift is sufficient for an ultralight craft, and significant increases in lift can be expected with optimisation of various design parameters.Water vapor is a strong greenhouse gas, but it has a half life of only nine days in the atmosphere, so it does not accumulate and trigger climate disruption, unlike carbon dioxide. There is something very special about using water vapor in Vacupulsion: water vapor begins to condense at one hundred degrees Celsius (at sea level), and sudden condensation creates a pressure drop. This is a source of power in storm supercells and has potential to add power to Vacupulsion processes. Another unexplored source of lift is the potential for formation of a warm toroidal vortex (like a smoke ring) above a hovering vaporjet.Why we are Raising Money and our Budget Breakdown.The most important thing to be aware of is that the enormously expensive and time consuming task of prototyping and testing Is now usually replaced with computer based simulation and 3D design. Simulation information allows the first prototype to have a good chance of success.We will not jump in and make ad hoc improvised prototypes that are likely to be very inefficient or inoperable. We will do a careful investigation, using computer simulation software apps, to see how various important factors or parameters affect the efficiency of Vacupulsion. (Parametric Analysis). That will be the first 3 phases of development of a vaporjet. We think that the minimum cost of doing Phases 1, 2 and 3 will total $100,000 and 4,000 hours of engineering R&D work.

Now, everyone can join in and become a part of Solar Roadways history.</p><p>· We're still in Research &amp; Development, so we're not making a profit yet. Therefore, we can still use your help. One of the things on our wish list is to do some more civil engineering (road) testing. We would also love to make some of our own machinery. The more of the production we can do ourselves and the more we can streamline it, the more we can keep costs down. The more money we can raise, the faster we can proceed to make our product available to the world.</p><p>· We received donations from 165 countries, which is a clear indication that the world is ready for the paradigm shift Solar Roadways will become.  We can't tell you what that level of support and encouragement has meant to us.</p><p>· Since our campaign, countless supporters have expressed what it means to them to help us spread the word. We need an educational component to create momentum. People tell us that the bumper stickers they put on their cars, the tote bags in their shopping carts, and the pendants around their necks provide a fun and effortless way for them to start conversations with others and we so appreciate that!</p><h3><b>What's been happening since our original campaign?</b></h3><p>Perks! We had over 48,000 donors - an Indiegogo record for that time. That equated to over 30,000 perks to process. Most of that was done by four generations of family members while Scott continued with the engineering work.</p><p>Paperwork! Due to the Indiegogo campaign, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) was nice enough to extend our Phase II SBIR contract final report deadline. We completed a successful construction and testing contract with the FHWA at the end of the year.</p><p>After the successful completion of the Phase II contract, the FHWA awarded us with another contract - a Phase IIB SBIR for an additional $750,000 over two years to do additional road testing: freeze/thaw cycling, moisture conditioning, shear testing, and advanced loading. These tests will get us that much closer to being approved for highway installations.</p><p>Renovation/moving - we wrapped up our original campaign in June. Soon after, we were hard at work searching for an economical and suitable building to purchase in Sandpoint, Idaho. Thanks to your generous donations, Solar Roadways was able to go from a ""garage operation"" to a more traditional business. Our ""new"" building needed work: we required both office space for engineers and shop space for manufacturing. We couldn't find anything ideal, so we improvised and renovated an 18-year-old shop building to meet our needs.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1217887/files/20150212163627-Pine_Street.jpg?1423787787"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Hiring! Scott and Julie are no longer working alone - there are now five of us and we're still growing. The interviewing process continues...</p><p> </p><p>​Engineering! We are hard at work with our team making some exciting changes to our panels in anticipation of our first public installations. We are focusing on making the panels more efficient, easy to install, and cost effective.</p><h3><b>What are the short term goals?</b></h3><p>We have several potential public pilot projects shaping up in Sandpoint, Idaho. All are within ten minutes of our new building. The ones we can currently discuss are:</p><p>Jeff Jones Square in downtown Sandpoint</p><p>Amtrak train station platforms</p><p>Sandpoint Airport (parking areas and tarmac)</p><p>Sandpoint Welcome Center parking lot</p><p>Animal shelter parking lot</p><p>Sandpoint downtown city sidewalks</p><p>In addition to Sandpoint, Idaho, we're working with the Missouri DOT to outfit a section of one of their rest areas along historic Rout 66 with our panels.</p><p>There are additional potential projects in the works, which we are not currently at liberty to discuss. Hint - many of them are extremely exciting and we can't wait to share when we have permission!</p><p>Our intent is to install as many of these projects as possible later this year. We'll monitor each of the installations and correct any glitches. Since we have already monitored our own prototype parking lot for four seasons, we don't expect many problems, but these will be public installations, so we may have a new learning curve!</p><p>After we're convinced that our panels are commercially ready, we'll make them available to the world - if all goes according to plan, that should take place in 2018. The first product available will be for non-critical applications such as parking lots, driveways, bike paths, sidewalks, etc.</p><h3><b>What are the long term goals?</b></h3><p>While we're supplying the non-critical application product, we'll continue working with civil engineering labs to make the product ready for roads and highways. There are still several tests to be performed before we will be ready for our biggest challenge - highways: advanced loading, sound testing, shear testing, deflective testing, etc. Our new contract with the FHWA should cover this testing. Once all of these tests have been passed, we should be ready for the world's roadways!</p><p>Solar Roadways is a modular paving system of solar panels that can withstand the heaviest of trucks (250,000 pounds). These Solar Road Panels can be installed on roads, parking lots, driveways, sidewalks, bike paths, playgrounds... literally any surface under the sun. They help pay for themselves primarily through the generation of electricity, which can power homes and businesses connected via driveways and parking lots. A nationwide system could produce more clean renewable energy than a country uses as a whole (<a href=""http://solarroadways.com/numbers.shtml"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://solarroadways.com/Home/Specifics</a>). They have many other features as well, including: heating elements to stay snow/ice free, LEDs to make road lines and signage, and attached Cable Corridor to store and treat stormwater and provide a ""home"" for power and data cables. EVs will be able to charge with energy from the sun (instead of fossil fuels) from parking lots and driveways and after a roadway system is in place, mutual induction technology will allow for charging while driving. </p><p> </p><h3><b>Did you know: </b></h3><p><b>· Solar Roadways has received three phases of funding from the U.S. Federal Highway Administration for research and development. </b></p><p><b>· Our glass surface has been tested for traction, load testing, and impact resistance testing in civil engineering laboratories around the country, and exceeded all requirements.</b></p><p><b>· Solar Roadways was chosen as a finalist in the IEEE Ace Awards in 2009 and 2010.</b></p><p><b>· Solar Roadways is a modular system that will modernize our aging infrastructure with an intelligent system that can become the new Smart Grid. In GE's Ecomagination Challenge, we won the Community Award of $50,000 by getting the most votes for ""Powering the Grid"" in 2010. We had the most votes again in their 2011 Ecomagination Challenge for ""Powering the Home"".</b></p><p><b>· On August 21, 2013, Solar Roadways was selected by their peers as a Finalist in the World Technology Award For Energy, presented in association with TIME, Fortune, CNN, and Science.</b></p><p><b>· Solar Roadways was chosen by Google to be one of their Moonshots in May of 2013. </b></p><p><b>· Solar Roadways was chosen by Popular Science as one of the 100 Greatest Innovations of the Year 2014</b></p><p><b>· Solar Roadways has given presentations around the country including: TEDx Sacramento, Google's Solve for X at Google's NYC Headquarters, NASA, Keynote Speaker for the International Parking Institute's Conference and much more...</b></p><p><b>· Solar Roadways is tackling more than solar energy: The FHWA tasked us with addressing the problem of stormwater. Currently, over 50% of the pollution in U.S. waterways comes from stormwater. We have created a section in our Cable Corridors for storing, treating, and moving stormwater.</b></p><p><b>· The implementation of our concept on a grand scale could create thousands of jobs in the U.S. and around the world. It could allow us all the ability to manufacture our way out of our current economic crisis.</b></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><h3 style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Would you like to join us?</b></h3><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">We've come a long way since our project was just an inspiration!  It's been an exciting journey, but also a tremendous amount of work for two people and occasional part time volunteers. Now, thanks to our supporters on Indiegogo, we're hiring a team to help us move into production.   We are blessed to have a multitude of potential customers, even before we are product ready. Many have been waiting on redoing driveways, parking lots, etc. hoping that we will be ready to give them the solar option they want.</p><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Our new facility in Sandpoint has the space to house our engineers and gives us a light manufacturing facility to get started. We need to make a few tweaks to our product and streamline our manufacturing process so that we can make our panels available to the public as quickly as possible.</p><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">If you love our concept, but aren't able to contribute financially, no worries. There are so many other ways to help out. We appreciate those who tell us they talk about Solar Roadways with people they meet. It helps us when people join in on our social media pages to ""like"", comment, share, tweet, and pin. We have to give a special shout out to our wonderful Facebook fans who have formed a sort of grass roots movement to help spread the word and move us forward. When we started our original Indiegogo campaign in April of 2014, we have about 6,000 Facebook fans. Today, we have over 88,000. Thank you to each and every one of you!</p><h3>Paradigm Shift</h3><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">The implementation of our Solar Roadways project on a grand scale would change the world as we know it in significant ways. Imagine the possibilities of a post Solar Roadways world: Your home could be all or nearly off grid thanks to your solar driveway (which you no longer have to shovel or plow if you live in the north), patio, or walkways etc. When you leave home, you'll be driving on Solar Roadways which are snow and ice free, pothole free, and the LEDs help you see the lines clearly and easily, especially at night when many people suffer night blindness.  A study in the UK showed that LED markers on road lines reduced nighttime accidents by 70-percent. If there is danger ahead from a deer in the road or a sudden accident, the intelligent road can sense this and warn you to ""Slow Down"". This will save the lives of countless animals and keep people safer too.  If you go somewhere new, the intelligent road can direct you with an LED-lit arrow that you follow to your destination. If you have an EV, you can stop and charge at a solar parking lot while you work, shop or eat, using clean energy from the sun. Eventually, you'll be able to charge while you drive via mutual induction panels. Solar Roadways will provide the infrastructure to make this possible.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 36px;letter-spacing: 1px;line-height: 40px;background-color: initial;"">Perks:</b></p><p>For our new InDemand Campaign, we've got a lot of great new ideas for perks!

<h1><b>About us:</b></h1>
<p>Scott and Julie are the co-inventors of Solar Roadways. Scott is an Electrical Engineer (MSEE) and Julie is a Counselor (MA LCPC LMFT). Scott has worked in the engineering field for over 25 years and his main fields of expertise are in hardware, firmware, and software. We started working on our project in 2009. It's been quite a journey taking our concept from a dream to where we are today, poised to become product ready and make the world a safer, greener place.</p>

<p><b>Snow melting test</b></p>
<p>The parking lot of your favorite store would be snow/ice free and lit with LEDs.  Handicapped spaces will be created as needed so they no longer have to be dedicated.  EVs can charge in the parking lot while you shop and business owners could also choose to offer some preferred parking spaces to EV owners. They could offer smaller spaces for motorcycles, larger spaces for RVs and trucks, all changeable at the touch of the manager’s computer button. The parking configuration itself can be changed as needed with presets too. Imagine your favorite sports arena all lit up with LED filled parking lots and walkways in team colors, perhaps displaying images of your favorite players on the walkway as you approach. Imagine going to an amusement park with solar walkways that change colors by area, event, time, or any other variable. Think of all of the tarmac at airports just baking in the sun. Our panels could not only generate large amounts of power, but pilots tell us they could be used to provide signage visible to them from the air.</p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1218105/files/20150212180848-recycled_glass.JPG?1423793328"" src=""""/></p>
<p><b>A mountain of recycled glass - we used 1600 pounds in our base layer</b></p>
<p><span>We are concerned about all of the mountains of trash in our landfills and even worse - in our oceans. We want to utilize recycled materials wherever possible. We were able to use recycled glass as ten percent of the aggregate in our base layer for our prototype parking lot and we want to work with materials engineers to use as many recycled materials as we can at every phase of production.</span></p>
<p>All of the ugly overhead cables that mar our landscape and are susceptible to damage from ice, can have a home now in our Cable Corridors, where utility workers can access them easily. There will be no more cell phone dead spots and no more need for cell towers due to the ""leaky"" cables that can be installed in the Cable Corridor. It would be a home for fiber optic internet too, bringing high speed internet to everyone.</p>
<p>The other side of our Cable Corridors will also store, treat and redistribute stormwater. Our lakes and rivers and oceans become polluted by stormwater which is rain water that picks up things like pesticides from lawns and oil from roads and makes its way into the nearest body of water. When it's collected in Cable Corridors, it can be treated on site or moved to treatment centers or to wherever it's needed such as agricultural centers, aquifers, or helping drought stricken areas for example. In parking lots, water can be treated and then delivered to landscaping or wherever the business owner wants it to go. We can have cleaner water to enjoy while protecting fish and whales and all of the amazing sea creatures that depend on our wisdom.</p>
<p>In America, our infrastructure is badly in need of updating. State DOTs are struggling for money and are not able to keep up with maintenance the way they would like to. We were thrilled when the Federal Highway Administration expressed an interest in what we were doing and provided us the funding to move our concept forward.</p>
<p>Solar Roadways can also become the Smart Grid. The roads that already traverse each country are perfect for becoming the grid that carries our power. It will allow us to create an organized system, a decentralized system which is secure and protected, unlike the current centralized power stations. Solar Roadways can become the hub which welcomes other types of renewable energy and other inventions into the Smart Grid for distribution.</p>
<p>Our grand vision includes the ability to help in various ways where there is a need. In times of disasters, such as earthquakes or tsunamis, lack of power hinders rescue workers. After the Haiti Earthquake, we were asked if we could send some panels.  Unfortunately, we were not product ready, but it made us realize how much our panels could help in such situations. They could be dropped in by helicopter and set up to provide a triage center for medical care and food distribution. There would be solar energy and light to help with current needs.</p>
<p>We often hear from third world countries such as African countries that desperately want our panels to help provide needed power. That power can be used to create clean drinking water and energy to run lights and computers for education.</p>
<p>We worry about Climate Change. We keep hearing reports that it's happening faster than expected. We can help by easing and then eliminating our dependence on fossil fuels. We began our project with the goal of helping with environmental issues and then realized our concept would help the world in so many other ways too.</p>
<p>So a post Solar Roadways world could be very different from the one we live in today. If you would welcome these changes, please join with us to help bring it about.   </p>
<p><b>More About Parking Lots</b></p>
<p>Our solar parking lots will offer many benefits to business owners. The solar energy alone could eliminate their monthly electric bill and would likely allow them to send power back to the grid, turning their parking lot into a source of profit.</p>
<p>The lots will be intelligent and the LED lights can reflect that intelligence in a myriad of ways. Managers will be able to change parking configurations at the touch of a button. Different  sizes can be offered: smaller spaces for motorcycles, larger ones for RVs etc. VIP spaces can be created for special visitors and then deleted just as quickly when they are gone. Some lot owners might want to give priority parking to EV owners and of course EV charging can be made available using standard plug in chargers or mutual induction plates. </p>
<p> EVs would be charging with the clean energy from the sun, instead of charging with fossil fuels, which is the current standard. Instead of dedicating a certain number of spaces for handipcapped drivers, such spaces could be created as needed, as the video below illustrates.  Retail owners could track customer trends and with feedback from the intelligent lot regarding capacity at different times.</p>
<p>Our Cable Corridors will be able to treat their stormwater on site. Water can be used for landscaping, grey water, etc.</p>
<p>Business owners who are early adopters are likely to find that their new parking lot has become a tourist attraction, drawing people to their business while showing the world their commitment to helping the environment, in the most obvious possible way. </p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FPVIIjwuIIxY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DPVIIjwuIIxY&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FPVIIjwuIIxY%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p>An intelligent parking lot can determine if a parking space is occupied or not. Once all available handicapped spaces are filled, an empty space is converted to an additional handicapped space. With this method, a parking lot will never run out of handicapped spaces.</p>

</div></div>","The TV show Innovation Nation chose Solar Roadways to compete in their #MoMadness Tournament on Twitter. All 16 inventions that they chose were truly wonderful. Solar Roadies voted Solar Roadways all the way to becoming the 1st annual (2018) MoMadness Tournament Champions!                                Meet our new mascot - Swoop! We are introducing him today to celebrate some exciting news: SR4 design has been completed this week and we are gearing up for production. So why did we name our moose Swoop? When we first came up with the Solar Roadways concept, we kept having ""aha moments', and said, ""Wow, we can solve so many problems in one fell swoop!"" We are now in Indiegogo's InDemand program:  It allows teams to re-open their campaigns and continue raising funds for their projects.We are very excited about this for many reasons:· We've had numerous requests since our original campaign ended: ""Can I still donate?"", ""Can I still get a Solar Roadways perk?"", ""I'd love to be a part of this movement"", etc. Many people hadn't even heard about Solar Roadways until after the campaign had ended. Now, everyone can join in and become a part of Solar Roadways history.· We're still in Research & Development, so we're not making a profit yet. Therefore, we can still use your help. One of the things on our wish list is to do some more civil engineering (road) testing. We would also love to make some of our own machinery. The more of the production we can do ourselves and the more we can streamline it, the more we can keep costs down. The more money we can raise, the faster we can proceed to make our product available to the world.· We received donations from 165 countries, which is a clear indication that the world is ready for the paradigm shift Solar Roadways will become.  We can't tell you what that level of support and encouragement has meant to us.· Since our campaign, countless supporters have expressed what it means to them to help us spread the word. We need an educational component to create momentum. People tell us that the bumper stickers they put on their cars, the tote bags in their shopping carts, and the pendants around their necks provide a fun and effortless way for them to start conversations with others and we so appreciate that!What's been happening since our original campaign?Perks! We had over 48,000 donors - an Indiegogo record for that time. That equated to over 30,000 perks to process. Most of that was done by four generations of family members while Scott continued with the engineering work.Paperwork! Due to the Indiegogo campaign, the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) was nice enough to extend our Phase II SBIR contract final report deadline. We completed a successful construction and testing contract with the FHWA at the end of the year.After the successful completion of the Phase II contract, the FHWA awarded us with another contract - a Phase IIB SBIR for an additional $750,000 over two years to do additional road testing: freeze/thaw cycling, moisture conditioning, shear testing, and advanced loading. These tests will get us that much closer to being approved for highway installations.Renovation/moving - we wrapped up our original campaign in June. Soon after, we were hard at work searching for an economical and suitable building to purchase in Sandpoint, Idaho. Thanks to your generous donations, Solar Roadways was able to go from a ""garage operation"" to a more traditional business. Our ""new"" building needed work: we required both office space for engineers and shop space for manufacturing. We couldn't find anything ideal, so we improvised and renovated an 18-year-old shop building to meet our needs. Hiring! Scott and Julie are no longer working alone - there are now five of us and we're still growing. The interviewing process continues... ​Engineering! We are hard at work with our team making some exciting changes to our panels in anticipation of our first public installations. We are focusing on making the panels more efficient, easy to install, and cost effective.What are the short term goals?We have several potential public pilot projects shaping up in Sandpoint, Idaho. All are within ten minutes of our new building. The ones we can currently discuss are:Jeff Jones Square in downtown SandpointAmtrak train station platformsSandpoint Airport (parking areas and tarmac)Sandpoint Welcome Center parking lotAnimal shelter parking lotSandpoint downtown city sidewalksIn addition to Sandpoint, Idaho, we're working with the Missouri DOT to outfit a section of one of their rest areas along historic Rout 66 with our panels.There are additional potential projects in the works, which we are not currently at liberty to discuss. Hint - many of them are extremely exciting and we can't wait to share when we have permission!Our intent is to install as many of these projects as possible later this year. We'll monitor each of the installations and correct any glitches. Since we have already monitored our own prototype parking lot for four seasons, we don't expect many problems, but these will be public installations, so we may have a new learning curve!After we're convinced that our panels are commercially ready, we'll make them available to the world - if all goes according to plan, that should take place in 2018. The first product available will be for non-critical applications such as parking lots, driveways, bike paths, sidewalks, etc.What are the long term goals?While we're supplying the non-critical application product, we'll continue working with civil engineering labs to make the product ready for roads and highways. There are still several tests to be performed before we will be ready for our biggest challenge - highways: advanced loading, sound testing, shear testing, deflective testing, etc. Our new contract with the FHWA should cover this testing. Once all of these tests have been passed, we should be ready for the world's roadways!Solar Roadways is a modular paving system of solar panels that can withstand the heaviest of trucks (250,000 pounds). These Solar Road Panels can be installed on roads, parking lots, driveways, sidewalks, bike paths, playgrounds... literally any surface under the sun. They help pay for themselves primarily through the generation of electricity, which can power homes and businesses connected via driveways and parking lots. A nationwide system could produce more clean renewable energy than a country uses as a whole (http://solarroadways.com/Home/Specifics). They have many other features as well, including: heating elements to stay snow/ice free, LEDs to make road lines and signage, and attached Cable Corridor to store and treat stormwater and provide a ""home"" for power and data cables. EVs will be able to charge with energy from the sun (instead of fossil fuels) from parking lots and driveways and after a roadway system is in place, mutual induction technology will allow for charging while driving.  Did you know: · Solar Roadways has received three phases of funding from the U.S. Federal Highway Administration for research and development. · Our glass surface has been tested for traction, load testing, and impact resistance testing in civil engineering laboratories around the country, and exceeded all requirements.· Solar Roadways was chosen as a finalist in the IEEE Ace Awards in 2009 and 2010.· Solar Roadways is a modular system that will modernize our aging infrastructure with an intelligent system that can become the new Smart Grid. In GE's Ecomagination Challenge, we won the Community Award of $50,000 by getting the most votes for ""Powering the Grid"" in 2010. We had the most votes again in their 2011 Ecomagination Challenge for ""Powering the Home"".· On August 21, 2013, Solar Roadways was selected by their peers as a Finalist in the World Technology Award For Energy, presented in association with TIME, Fortune, CNN, and Science.· Solar Roadways was chosen by Google to be one of their Moonshots in May of 2013. · Solar Roadways was chosen by Popular Science as one of the 100 Greatest Innovations of the Year 2014· Solar Roadways has given presentations around the country including: TEDx Sacramento, Google's Solve for X at Google's NYC Headquarters, NASA, Keynote Speaker for the International Parking Institute's Conference and much more...· Solar Roadways is tackling more than solar energy: The FHWA tasked us with addressing the problem of stormwater. Currently, over 50% of the pollution in U.S. waterways comes from stormwater. We have created a section in our Cable Corridors for storing, treating, and moving stormwater.· The implementation of our concept on a grand scale could create thousands of jobs in the U.S. and around the world. It could allow us all the ability to manufacture our way out of our current economic crisis.   Would you like to join us?We've come a long way since our project was just an inspiration!  It's been an exciting journey, but also a tremendous amount of work for two people and occasional part time volunteers. Now, thanks to our supporters on Indiegogo, we're hiring a team to help us move into production.   We are blessed to have a multitude of potential customers, even before we are product ready. Many have been waiting on redoing driveways, parking lots, etc. hoping that we will be ready to give them the solar option they want.Our new facility in Sandpoint has the space to house our engineers and gives us a light manufacturing facility to get started. We need to make a few tweaks to our product and streamline our manufacturing process so that we can make our panels available to the public as quickly as possible.If you love our concept, but aren't able to contribute financially, no worries. There are so many other ways to help out. We appreciate those who tell us they talk about Solar Roadways with people they meet. It helps us when people join in on our social media pages to ""like"", comment, share, tweet, and pin. We have to give a special shout out to our wonderful Facebook fans who have formed a sort of grass roots movement to help spread the word and move us forward. When we started our original Indiegogo campaign in April of 2014, we have about 6,000 Facebook fans. Today, we have over 88,000. Thank you to each and every one of you!Paradigm ShiftThe implementation of our Solar Roadways project on a grand scale would change the world as we know it in significant ways. Imagine the possibilities of a post Solar Roadways world: Your home could be all or nearly off grid thanks to your solar driveway (which you no longer have to shovel or plow if you live in the north), patio, or walkways etc. When you leave home, you'll be driving on Solar Roadways which are snow and ice free, pothole free, and the LEDs help you see the lines clearly and easily, especially at night when many people suffer night blindness.  A study in the UK showed that LED markers on road lines reduced nighttime accidents by 70-percent. If there is danger ahead from a deer in the road or a sudden accident, the intelligent road can sense this and warn you to ""Slow Down"". This will save the lives of countless animals and keep people safer too.  If you go somewhere new, the intelligent road can direct you with an LED-lit arrow that you follow to your destination. If you have an EV, you can stop and charge at a solar parking lot while you work, shop or eat, using clean energy from the sun. Eventually, you'll be able to charge while you drive via mutual induction panels. Solar Roadways will provide the infrastructure to make this possible.    Perks:For our new InDemand Campaign, we've got a lot of great new ideas for perks! Many people have written with requests and we've been working with our team to create some brand new items. We'll ship all items free of charge (for deliveries outside of the U.S., we cannot be responsible for any duty fees or extra charges).Solar Freakin' Flashdrive!8GB, USB 2.0 includes viral Solar Freakin' Roadways video!Image shows front and back.

We are concerned about all of the mountains of trash in our landfills and even worse - in our oceans. We want to utilize recycled materials wherever possible. We were able to use recycled glass as ten percent of the aggregate in our base layer for our prototype parking lot and we want to work with materials engineers to use as many recycled materials as we can at every phase of production.
All of the ugly overhead cables that mar our landscape and are susceptible to damage from ice, can have a home now in our Cable Corridors, where utility workers can access them easily. There will be no more cell phone dead spots and no more need for cell towers due to the ""leaky"" cables that can be installed in the Cable Corridor. It would be a home for fiber optic internet too, bringing high speed internet to everyone.
The other side of our Cable Corridors will also store, treat and redistribute stormwater. Our lakes and rivers and oceans become polluted by stormwater which is rain water that picks up things like pesticides from lawns and oil from roads and makes its way into the nearest body of water. When it's collected in Cable Corridors, it can be treated on site or moved to treatment centers or to wherever it's needed such as agricultural centers, aquifers, or helping drought stricken areas for example. In parking lots, water can be treated and then delivered to landscaping or wherever the business owner wants it to go. We can have cleaner water to enjoy while protecting fish and whales and all of the amazing sea creatures that depend on our wisdom.
In America, our infrastructure is badly in need of updating. State DOTs are struggling for money and are not able to keep up with maintenance the way they would like to. We were thrilled when the Federal Highway Administration expressed an interest in what we were doing and provided us the funding to move our concept forward.
Solar Roadways can also become the Smart Grid. The roads that already traverse each country are perfect for becoming the grid that carries our power. It will allow us to create an organized system, a decentralized system which is secure and protected, unlike the current centralized power stations. Solar Roadways can become the hub which welcomes other types of renewable energy and other inventions into the Smart Grid for distribution.
Our grand vision includes the ability to help in various ways where there is a need. In times of disasters, such as earthquakes or tsunamis, lack of power hinders rescue workers. After the Haiti Earthquake, we were asked if we could send some panels.  Unfortunately, we were not product ready, but it made us realize how much our panels could help in such situations. They could be dropped in by helicopter and set up to provide a triage center for medical care and food distribution. There would be solar energy and light to help with current needs.
We often hear from third world countries such as African countries that desperately want our panels to help provide needed power. That power can be used to create clean drinking water and energy to run lights and computers for education.
We worry about Climate Change. We keep hearing reports that it's happening faster than expected. We can help by easing and then eliminating our dependence on fossil fuels. We began our project with the goal of helping with environmental issues and then realized our concept would help the world in so many other ways too.
So a post Solar Roadways world could be very different from the one we live in today. If you would welcome these changes, please join with us to help bring it about.   
More About Parking Lots
Our solar parking lots will offer many benefits to business owners. The solar energy alone could eliminate their monthly electric bill and would likely allow them to send power back to the grid, turning their parking lot into a source of profit.
The lots will be intelligent and the LED lights can reflect that intelligence in a myriad of ways. Managers will be able to change parking configurations at the touch of a button. Different  sizes can be offered: smaller spaces for motorcycles, larger ones for RVs etc. VIP spaces can be created for special visitors and then deleted just as quickly when they are gone. Some lot owners might want to give priority parking to EV owners and of course EV charging can be made available using standard plug in chargers or mutual induction plates. 
 EVs would be charging with the clean energy from the sun, instead of charging with fossil fuels, which is the current standard. Instead of dedicating a certain number of spaces for handipcapped drivers, such spaces could be created as needed, as the video below illustrates.  Retail owners could track customer trends and with feedback from the intelligent lot regarding capacity at different times.
Our Cable Corridors will be able to treat their stormwater on site. Water can be used for landscaping, grey water, etc.
Business owners who are early adopters are likely to find that their new parking lot has become a tourist attraction, drawing people to their business while showing the world their commitment to helping the environment, in the most obvious possible way. 

An intelligent parking lot can determine if a parking space is occupied or not. Once all available handicapped spaces are filled, an empty space is converted to an additional handicapped space. With this method, a parking lot will never run out of handicapped spaces.
 
How can your donation help?
Your donations to our original campaign allowed us to acquire and renovate a building to meet our needs, hire staff, and purchase needed equipment. 
We're still in need of specialized manufacturing equipment to streamline the assembly process. Your donations will help get us to market faster. 
We feel truly blessed and overwhelmed with the outpouring of support from around the world. The time for Solar Roadways has come, and you each now have a part in it - thank you so very much!

Shipping cost is not refundable. Risks and challengesWe understand there might be unforeseen issues even for the best laid plan, however, samples of PocketPower have been made, tested, and put into some real life situations to use. They perform very well. Also in November PocketPower passed CE RoHS FCC tests.Our biggest challenge will be international delivery because different countries have different policies. Some unexpected components shortage can happen. In that case, we will try our best to solve the problem. However, PocketPower is our second kickstarter campaign. We have successfully delivered Powerleaf solar chargers to kickstarter backers , so this time shipping will be easier.Please also feel free to let us know your concerns, we look forward to hearing from the Indiegogo community.

<h3>How it works</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>You need:</strong><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1515768747/jsjrhwksmpdj0hpu9ile.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Nofence system consists of the collars worn by the animals, as well as an app that works on tablets and smartphones (iOS &amp; Android).</p> <p><strong>Draw the grazing area</strong></p>
<p>The app allows you to draw the virtual fence on a digital map. Keep in mind the natural behaviour of your goats and their ability to understand Nofence when drawing the virtual fence. If the area is too small, doesn’t have the variety of vegetation that the goats want or does not satisfy basic needs, they are less likely to respect the Nofence boundary. In addition, the grazing area shouldn’t have any sharp angles or excessively narrow corridors. Also remember that GPS works best if the collar has a clear line of sight in all directions.</p>
<p>Nofence allows you to create whatever grazing area you want, but obviously you should bear in mind the terrain and surroundings. Give the animals access to water by putting the boundary slightly into a tarn, lake or a river. Give access to rocky terrain, that the goat loves, but is difficult to fence. Manage your livestock to improve your land. Use this great tool and give yourself and your animals a better farm life!</p>

<p>(The general terms &amp; conditions that will apply, can be found on our website <strong><a href=""http://nofence.no/pricing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>)</strong></p>
<h3>Delivery time</h3>
<p>We plan for delivery in some selected markets first. Norway, our home market, will be prioritized to get the first deliveries.</p>
<ul>
<li>Norway Q3 2018 (estimated late june)</li>
<li>Europe Q3 2018 (estimated august)</li>

</ul>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The product works and has been used by 120 pilot farmers in Norway the last two years. A total of 1200 collars and approx. 3.000.000 hours of thorough testing have given us a great opportunity to improve the prototype collar to an industrialized and market ready product.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1514888617/dgn2zdepn9trslltxxpp.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><i>The 2016 Prototype used in the two year trials in Norway - Se also the videos below.</i></p>
<p>We have experienced a lot of trouble in the pilot, like watertightness, hardware issues and energy issues. These risks are now strongly mitigated for the next version of the collar. We have completely re-designed the collar so it will meet those issues or in technical terms; IP-54 class. Hardware design is improved through cooperation with industry leading advisors and suppliers. So far, energy balance has been the biggest issue. Continuous position measurements and data transmission are energy consuming. The collar has solar panels to refill energy into the battery. The new design will therefore have a battery package that can easily be replaced when necessary. For comparison to your farm, we achieved 30-40  days of use before battery change, at a farm in North West coast of Norway, September 2016.</p>
<p>Energy consumption depends on how close the animals are grazing to the Nofence boundary. Larger pastures generally gives less energy consumption due to smart software. You must expect to replace batteries during use, especially in northern Europe, but we ensure you that we are working hard every day towards the ultimate goal of energy balance in demanding countries like Norway. In other countries, more blessed with solar radiation, this could be significant better in theory, but we have no data to quantify this (yet…)</p>
<p>The collar has a satelite receiver that provide position data. Position accuracy  can be an issue near ie. steep cliffs or near/inside buildings. The best position accuracy is however found in open landscapes that correlates well with quality pastures. If the animals absolutely have to be in areas with less accurate position data, we have a bluetooth beacon that can be used for this purpose. You will get more information and guidance about this later.</p>
<p>The collar communicates through the mobile phone network - It sends you notifications, receives firmware-updates and changes you make on the nofence boundary or the flock. NB! Be aware that you will need mobile phone coverage where you will use the product.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>As a child, Oscar Hovde Berntsen, the inventor and founder of Nofence, envisioned a future without fences. He grew up on a small scale farm on the north-west coast of rural Norway with lots of animals. He loved to release the animals from their fences, so they could enjoy the fresh pastures in the hillsides. The idea of the possibility to drop fences was born. Some years after he graduated with an engineering degree in electronics, the available technology were starting to mature, and in 2007 - 10 years ago - he decided to start exploring the idea and make the first mock-ups for a collar that could make virtual fencing a reality. And it worked!<br/>Meet Oscar:</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ghci-WOZrR0?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Now, ten years later we are a small group of dedicated engineers and farmers who use this equipment on a daily basis.<br/>Meet Magnus from Nofence - He started a lucrative goat grazing service:</p>

<p>A prototype has been in use for two years and has delivered real value to our 120 pilot customers and virtual fences to 1200 goats throughout Norway. With this valuable experience and acid test we are now moving one more step and are ready to start the very first sale - We are excited to invite you to join our journey</p>
<h3>Use of funds</h3>
<p>For delivery in 2018 we are going to produce a limited number of goat-collars.  This first round of sale will hopefully give us the necessary funding to start the early growth of our company. We will use these funds to hire the next key employees. </p>

3D Model of the 2018 Nofence Goat Collar
 
The Product packages in this campaign (Perks)
The goat collars provided in this campaign comes in two types of product packages, each in a few different sizes that can be combined to the amount of collars you need:
1) PRE-PAID 12 month - 1, 4, 6 or 10 CollarsThe best deal - Buy the collars you need with 12 months of subscription cost included at a reduced price. Suitable for those grazing all the year. (Cost equivalent to approx. 7 months use of FLEX)
2) FLEX - 1, 4, 6 or 10 CollarsThe flexible deal - Buy the collars and pay the subscription cost monthly, starting when you receive the collars. Suitable if you want to reduce up-front cost and pay as you go. 
(The general terms & conditions that will apply, can be found on our website here)
Delivery time
We plan for delivery in some selected markets first. Norway, our home market, will be prioritized to get the first deliveries.

Norway Q3 2018 (estimated late june)
Europe Q3 2018 (estimated august)
Australia & New Zealand Q4 2018 (estimated october)
USA & Canada Q4 2018 (estimated december)

Risks & Challenges
The product works and has been used by 120 pilot farmers in Norway the last two years. A total of 1200 collars and approx. 3.000.000 hours of thorough testing have given us a great opportunity to improve the prototype collar to an industrialized and market ready product.
The 2016 Prototype used in the two year trials in Norway - Se also the videos below.
We have experienced a lot of trouble in the pilot, like watertightness, hardware issues and energy issues. These risks are now strongly mitigated for the next version of the collar. We have completely re-designed the collar so it will meet those issues or in technical terms; IP-54 class. Hardware design is improved through cooperation with industry leading advisors and suppliers. So far, energy balance has been the biggest issue. Continuous position measurements and data transmission are energy consuming. The collar has solar panels to refill energy into the battery. The new design will therefore have a battery package that can easily be replaced when necessary. For comparison to your farm, we achieved 30-40  days of use before battery change, at a farm in North West coast of Norway, September 2016.
Energy consumption depends on how close the animals are grazing to the Nofence boundary. Larger pastures generally gives less energy consumption due to smart software. You must expect to replace batteries during use, especially in northern Europe, but we ensure you that we are working hard every day towards the ultimate goal of energy balance in demanding countries like Norway. In other countries, more blessed with solar radiation, this could be significant better in theory, but we have no data to quantify this (yet…)
The collar has a satelite receiver that provide position data. Position accuracy  can be an issue near ie. steep cliffs or near/inside buildings. The best position accuracy is however found in open landscapes that correlates well with quality pastures. If the animals absolutely have to be in areas with less accurate position data, we have a bluetooth beacon that can be used for this purpose. You will get more information and guidance about this later.
The collar communicates through the mobile phone network - It sends you notifications, receives firmware-updates and changes you make on the nofence boundary or the flock. NB! Be aware that you will need mobile phone coverage where you will use the product.
Background
As a child, Oscar Hovde Berntsen, the inventor and founder of Nofence, envisioned a future without fences. He grew up on a small scale farm on the north-west coast of rural Norway with lots of animals. He loved to release the animals from their fences, so they could enjoy the fresh pastures in the hillsides. The idea of the possibility to drop fences was born. Some years after he graduated with an engineering degree in electronics, the available technology were starting to mature, and in 2007 - 10 years ago - he decided to start exploring the idea and make the first mock-ups for a collar that could make virtual fencing a reality. And it worked!Meet Oscar:

Now, ten years later we are a small group of dedicated engineers and farmers who use this equipment on a daily basis.Meet Magnus from Nofence - He started a lucrative goat grazing service:

A prototype has been in use for two years and has delivered real value to our 120 pilot customers and virtual fences to 1200 goats throughout Norway. With this valuable experience and acid test we are now moving one more step and are ready to start the very first sale - We are excited to invite you to join our journey
Use of funds
For delivery in 2018 we are going to produce a limited number of goat-collars.  This first round of sale will hopefully give us the necessary funding to start the early growth of our company. We will use these funds to hire the next key employees. 
Team
Meet the current employees:
In addition we have a strong team of external advisors:
Hardcore Hardware Designer: Leif Gunnar Ellingsen at PartnerPlast Software Architect: Per Sandved Hustad  and the rest of the great Axbit-teamIndustrial Designers at Minoko Design
Production and final assembly  is being done at SIMPRO , located just an hour drive away. 
Important notice before you buy:
Now we are offering Nofence collar that is designed, tested and documented specific for use on goats. Collars for cattle is our next priority and will be available in 2019 - Trials for sheep will start during 2018. 

That means it can be used for GOATS ONLY

.You need cell phone coverage at the grazing site to be able to use the system!
We have proper scientific documentation that the product has no animal welfare issues. You will be responsible to make sure if there are any regulatory issues prohibiting use in your country.
Remember that goats need companions. We recommend a minimum of 4 goats in one flock for optimal performance and animal welfare.
Our general terms & conditions will apply - By placing an order through Indiegogo you have agreed to these. Please find these on our web page
VAT is not included in the prices. For norwegian customers we will invoice VAT (Merverdiavgift) after delivery.

<p>Our goal was to get funding to commercialize our product. We are partnering with the Xiang Yang Institute of Hubei Province, China to develop the ""Microgrid Module"" (<a href=""http://www.focused-sun.com/fs/products/microgrid"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.focused-sun.com/fs/products/microgrid</a> ).  It is a variation of our FourFold module -- using the same mirrors and frame but with a high temperature absorber (<a href=""http://www.focused-sun.com/fs/technology/hybrid_absorber"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.focused-sun.com/fs/technology/hybrid_absorber</a>). Its heat can be stored thermally for a day or more and then delivered to a turbo-generator that produces electricity day or night. Leftover heat from the turbo-generator, like the FourFold, can heat homes and their hot water.  See <a href=""http://cleantechnica.com/2015/01/09/focused-sun-xiang-yang-institute-partnering-bring-solar-microgrids-china/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+IM-cleantechnica+%28CleanTechnica%29"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://cleantechnica.com/2015/01/09/focused-sun-xiang-yang-institute-partnering-bring-solar-microgrids-china/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+IM-cleantechnica+%28CleanTechnica%29</a></p>

<h3>*************************************</h3>
<h3>Summary</h3>
</div>
<p>I'm Shawn Buckley,
founder of Focused Sun and inventor of the FourFold solar module. I'm a former
professor of Mechanical Engineering at MIT, specializing in solar energy.
 I've written a best selling solar energy book, Sunup to Sundown (McGraw-Hill). 
This isn't my first rodeo: I was a founder of Chevron's solar energy
subsidiary, Hydro Sun, over 30 years ago. Since then I've founded 3 other Silicon Valley startups.</p><p>The FourFold solar panel collects four times more energy from the sun than a conventional photovoltaic (PV) panel.  It's called a ""hybrid"" because both heat and electricity are captured.</p><p>A quarter of its peak energy is electricity (500 W) and three quarters is heat (1500 W). With 2.8 square meters of collecting area, it delivers 2000 peak Watts of energy. List priced at $3000, that's $1.50 per peak Watt.  It's  light enough for roof mounting and its heat can be as valuable as its electricity, especially for water heating, home heating and water sterilization. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1051049/files/20141127055127-Module_with_callouts.jpg?1417096287"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Hybrids aren't new; several other companies make them.  What's new
is that we've squeezed the cost and weight from our hybrid.  We make our panels using
""sandwich fabrication"", a modern way to make cheap, strong structures.  They cost about as much as a conventional panel of the same size, yet produce 4X more energy. 
</p><p>Just as important, sandwich fabrication lets us make these panels in a small factory.  As few as 5 people could start a solar factory in a town as small as 5,000. The factory sells, makes, installs and maintains FourFold modules.  It
brings jobs to the town and government tax rebates to the town's economy. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1023246/files/20141117112110-Assembling_Mirror.jpg?1416252070"" src="""" style=""width: 493.67px; height: 340px;""/></p><p>We need your help to bring this innovation to volume production.  We have working prototypes and we've done pilot production, but we need to spend a year of testing,
sourcing, training and certification before we have a product we can sell.  </p>
<p>Stopping our world from burning fossil fuels is the challenge of our century. These fuels pollute our air, distort our geopolitics and warm our climate. Some say solar energy is the answer.  But if a conventional PV panel is good, our hybrid is four times better.  If solar energy is one Princeton
Wedge, ours is four Wedges. And four Wedges is half the global
warming problem (<a href=""http://cmi.princeton.edu/wedges/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://cmi.princeton.edu/wedges/</a>). </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1023804/files/20141117140357-Untitled-12.gif?1416261837"" src="""" style=""width: 448.45px; height: 274px;""/></p><p>Foundations, your donations can reduce global warming more than any other way. Dollar for dollar, a Focused Sun donation counts four times more than conventional solar.  Sponsor a FourFold module at a village clinic or school. Make an impact by contributing to a sustainable world.</p><p>Sounds like a good idea?  We think its the <b>best</b> solar
solution there is.  We have the lowest cost way of making a solar panel – sandwich fabrication – and we capture 75% of the sun's heat.  This combination is as good as it gets in the most important issue of
renewable energy: how economic is it? </p>
<p>Still, a solar
technology is only as good as how many people use it. Our small factories allow
anyone, anywhere in the world, to manufacture these panels.  </p>
<div><h3>What We Need</h3></div>
<p>We've been working on
the FourFold module for several years.  We're on our fourth prototype design,
our third absorber design, our fifth plumbing design, our third electronics
design and our seventh software version. We have worked very hard to get the costs down on electronics, gear motors and other high-tech components that Focused Sun will supply to local factories.</p>
<p>The other 80% of the module is made locally.  We seek local suppliers that can
make our sheet metal and frame parts in higher volumes and at lower cost. Not only are its mirrors and frame locally made but so is its energy storage shed.  Plumbing, heat storage tank, insulation, fan, inverter, pumps and valving are assembled by the local factory. We've made modules in pilot production.  Now we must move toward volume
production and <span style=""font-size: 15.55px;"">commercialization</span><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;'>.</span></p><p>To get to a commercial product we need testing, testing and more testing. We must install and test our module in various climates to find all the problems that could ever arise. It must be ""bulletproof"" before we can begin to sell it. We think a year is required to be sure that we have a thoroughly tested system – one that makes every buyer happy he owns one. </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F111125879&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F111125879%2B&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F495628411_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>Before a buyer can get tax rebates, our module must pass certification. Certification is where respected testing
companies put the module through its paces. Is it safe? Does it produce as much
energy as we claim? Would it last as long as we say? After our own in-house testing, we'll get the module certified. Normally it's a process that
takes a month and can cost $100,000. For a hybrid it's twice that because both its
electrical and heat performance must be evaluated.</p><p>We also need to train people to set up our factories and after that, build and install modules made in them.  Our pilot production used interns from our local university, New Mexico State University. Now we need to set up training programs for many more people.  Our advisor, Prof. Amir Abtahi has done this before. For over a decade he has trained his students at Florida Atlantic University to install solar panels. He is even certified by the state of Florida to train solar installer trainers.  Training is an important part of what your donation will fund. <br/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 30px; letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;"">What You Get</span><br/></p>

Focused Sun Supporters:  Our campaign ends today and our donations have fallen far short of our goal. But do not despair; all is not lost. 
Our goal was to get funding to commercialize our product. We are partnering with the Xiang Yang Institute of Hubei Province, China to develop the ""Microgrid Module"" (www.focused-sun.com/fs/products/microgrid ).  It is a variation of our FourFold module -- using the same mirrors and frame but with a high temperature absorber (www.focused-sun.com/fs/technology/hybrid_absorber). Its heat can be stored thermally for a day or more and then delivered to a turbo-generator that produces electricity day or night. Leftover heat from the turbo-generator, like the FourFold, can heat homes and their hot water.  See http://cleantechnica.com/2015/01/09/focused-sun-xiang-yang-institute-partnering-bring-solar-microgrids-china/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+IM-cleantechnica+%28CleanTechnica%29

Response to our offer of setting up solar factories was strong.  Nearly a hundred groups from around the world want to start one.  Besides the US, counties include Indonesia, South Africa, Nigeria, India, Korea, Australia, Malaysia, France, UK, Cambodia, New Zealand, Mexico, Egypt and the  Philippines.  In addition,  we have had dozens of investment offers.  Thank you for your support.  Focused Sun lives on!

*************************************
Summary

I'm Shawn Buckley,
founder of Focused Sun and inventor of the FourFold solar module. I'm a former
professor of Mechanical Engineering at MIT, specializing in solar energy.
 I've written a best selling solar energy book, Sunup to Sundown (McGraw-Hill). 
This isn't my first rodeo: I was a founder of Chevron's solar energy
subsidiary, Hydro Sun, over 30 years ago. Since then I've founded 3 other Silicon Valley startups.The FourFold solar panel collects four times more energy from the sun than a conventional photovoltaic (PV) panel.  It's called a ""hybrid"" because both heat and electricity are captured.A quarter of its peak energy is electricity (500 W) and three quarters is heat (1500 W). With 2.8 square meters of collecting area, it delivers 2000 peak Watts of energy. List priced at $3000, that's $1.50 per peak Watt.  It's  light enough for roof mounting and its heat can be as valuable as its electricity, especially for water heating, home heating and water sterilization. Hybrids aren't new; several other companies make them.  What's new
is that we've squeezed the cost and weight from our hybrid.  We make our panels using
""sandwich fabrication"", a modern way to make cheap, strong structures.  They cost about as much as a conventional panel of the same size, yet produce 4X more energy. 
Just as important, sandwich fabrication lets us make these panels in a small factory.  As few as 5 people could start a solar factory in a town as small as 5,000. The factory sells, makes, installs and maintains FourFold modules.  It
brings jobs to the town and government tax rebates to the town's economy. We need your help to bring this innovation to volume production.  We have working prototypes and we've done pilot production, but we need to spend a year of testing,
sourcing, training and certification before we have a product we can sell.  
Stopping our world from burning fossil fuels is the challenge of our century. These fuels pollute our air, distort our geopolitics and warm our climate. Some say solar energy is the answer.  But if a conventional PV panel is good, our hybrid is four times better.  If solar energy is one Princeton
Wedge, ours is four Wedges. And four Wedges is half the global
warming problem (http://cmi.princeton.edu/wedges/). Foundations, your donations can reduce global warming more than any other way. Dollar for dollar, a Focused Sun donation counts four times more than conventional solar.  Sponsor a FourFold module at a village clinic or school. Make an impact by contributing to a sustainable world.Sounds like a good idea?  We think its the best solar
solution there is.  We have the lowest cost way of making a solar panel – sandwich fabrication – and we capture 75% of the sun's heat.  This combination is as good as it gets in the most important issue of
renewable energy: how economic is it? 
Still, a solar
technology is only as good as how many people use it. Our small factories allow
anyone, anywhere in the world, to manufacture these panels.  
What We Need
We've been working on
the FourFold module for several years.  We're on our fourth prototype design,
our third absorber design, our fifth plumbing design, our third electronics
design and our seventh software version. We have worked very hard to get the costs down on electronics, gear motors and other high-tech components that Focused Sun will supply to local factories.
The other 80% of the module is made locally.  We seek local suppliers that can
make our sheet metal and frame parts in higher volumes and at lower cost. Not only are its mirrors and frame locally made but so is its energy storage shed.  Plumbing, heat storage tank, insulation, fan, inverter, pumps and valving are assembled by the local factory. We've made modules in pilot production.  Now we must move toward volume
production and commercialization.To get to a commercial product we need testing, testing and more testing. We must install and test our module in various climates to find all the problems that could ever arise. It must be ""bulletproof"" before we can begin to sell it. We think a year is required to be sure that we have a thoroughly tested system – one that makes every buyer happy he owns one. 
Before a buyer can get tax rebates, our module must pass certification. Certification is where respected testing
companies put the module through its paces. Is it safe? Does it produce as much
energy as we claim? Would it last as long as we say? After our own in-house testing, we'll get the module certified. Normally it's a process that
takes a month and can cost $100,000. For a hybrid it's twice that because both its
electrical and heat performance must be evaluated.We also need to train people to set up our factories and after that, build and install modules made in them.  Our pilot production used interns from our local university, New Mexico State University. Now we need to set up training programs for many more people.  Our advisor, Prof. Amir Abtahi has done this before. For over a decade he has trained his students at Florida Atlantic University to install solar panels. He is even certified by the state of Florida to train solar installer trainers.  Training is an important part of what your donation will fund. What You Get
Our most
important donations are aimed at those that want to make the move into
renewable energy.  Have you been considering solar energy?  Your donation reserves a future FourFold module.  Your home can turn into a free energy zone.  Sunlight instead of fossil fuels can
run your TV and heat your shower.   Better yet, donate to sponsor a solar factory. Help put one in your hometown.  Your donation  can train someone from your hometown.  Our training classes teach you how to set up a factory, how to work with suppliers to have parts made locally, how to use your factory to manufacture modules, how to sell solar and how to install modules on homes and businesses.  Want to set up your kid in a profitable local business? Donate to his training program.Part of our goal will
be reached simply by exposing this technology to the world. This is the first
time it's been publicized. Is there a student in Nigeria that wants to help his
village? Is there a woman in China that wants to make a thriving business? Are
there European tradesmen that want to be free from ever rising fuel prices.

<h2><strong>If Clean, Emissions Free Energy is Your Choice!</strong></h2>
<p>Hi There,</p>
<p>My name is John. This is my public attempt to have some of the results of my personal Green Energy Research Project accepted. I am completely willing to discuss any aspect of this project and disclose the theory and design details to an appropriately interested party.</p>
<p>If there are other people out there in the world that believe as I do that time is rapidly running out for our global environment and that we must act now, this is your opportunity to choose a different future than the one filled with increasingly more devastating 'natural events'.</p>
<p>I believe that climate and ecological upheaval is a terrible and urgent problem. I have worked very hard for a long time in my research. I have a found a solution for some of the most urgent problems.</p>
<p>Following are three applications of one machine concept left behind by Nikola Tesla. My claim is that I understand how to build this machine using his empirical concepts of the electrical arts:</p>
<p>1) This apparatus will break down carbon dioxide molecules in a cheap and simple manner. This is great news for stopping the worldwide destruction we are causing by these emissions. This solution means hydrocarbon burning can continue as a source of supply for our energy needs.</p>
<p>2) A similar machine makes ozone from atmospheric oxygen, which is also great news for people where clean water and sanitation and waste treatment are problems. Water can be easily purified of pathogens.</p>
<p>3) This method also breaks apart atmospheric nitrogen for fertilizers and synthetic fuels. This would mean that in places where people do not have hydrocarbons they could burn nitrogen instead.</p>
<p>I would like to complete this work but I can not do this without your help. I did not give up this search years ago because of the skepticism I encountered towards finding a solution. I persevered because of my belief in the urgency and danger of extinction of and to so many lifeforms and what that means for human civilizations.</p>
<p>If you, as an individual want an alternative to what has already begun, I am offering this chance and choice to you. Simply cast your vote by making a donation to this cause.

<p>I am Phil Vaughan, a 54 year old electrical/mechanical engineer who in a career break between 2001 and 2006, undertook various courses on physical training and exercise.</p>
<p>I ran a gym through this time (L.I.P.S. Leap Into Perfect Shape) based in Stubbington Avenue, North End, Portsmouth, UK. A very popular private gymnasium.</p>
<p>It was at this point that my imagination was sparked to work on the possibility of transferring physical energy into electrical energy mainly due to the high electrical costs of running the place.</p>
<p>My gym days ceased in 2006 and I went back to my apprentice trained occupation but the thought never went away.</p>
<p>As time went by with running being my main physical exercise (many <a href=""https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/get-involved/events-and-fundraising/join-event/running/10-mile/great-south-run"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Great South Runs</a> in Portsmouth, of course) a  medical fault occurred that would curtail my running and push me back into gym work to continue my life health.</p>
<p>The problem was a ""first degree, heart block"" which sounds severe and potentially could have been a heart attack, if I hadn't been as physically fit as I was, at the time!</p>
<p>My prognosis (according to the cardiologist) was to stay as cardio vascularly fit as you are now, for as long as you can otherwise they will need to install a pacemaker! Yikes.</p>
<p>So a plan formulated a few years ago to carry out the physical energy to electrical energy transfer by buying bits that were affordable and use my experience to produce a machine that will keep me fit and charge phones, ipads, computers, LEDs, charge batteries and put power back into the house.</p>
<p>I now have a product that works (prototype) but it can be made a lot better and more efficient with some financial and specialist assistance.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our GEN-Ergy project is in its infancy (stage 1-completed) where I have invested over £13,000 to get to the prototype stage whereby the system works and I train on it 5 days a week. We are extremely close to completing stage 2 to create a more mobile structure. If you are interested, follow our journey through our social channels:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1W5ZTHOx0vV7-63xcEhEjA/featured"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Human GEN ergy</a> on YouTube</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/HumanGENergy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HumanGENergy </a>on Facebook</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We need your help to take our HumanGENergy Project through the next 2 stages! Right now we are fundraising for £10,000 to take us to stage 3 to get specialist electronic help to make the system as efficient as we can to get even more electrical power output!</p>
<p>Stage 4 requires additional funding to use the technology we will have perfected with our air stepper and replicate it for other fitness apparatus such as cross trainers, bicycles and rowing machines. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Return for your Investment</h3>
<p>For every £ 100 raised I will give you a 30 minute training set on the GENergy machine, with me (the inventor) so you can have your ""Frankenstein moment"" where you can see your physical effort turn into useful electricity to power, operating iphones, ipads, battery chargers, light LEDs or charging power back into the house!</p>
<p>When we get the full money raised across each stage, anyone who has invested will get their money they have invested with us off of the full production GEN-ergy machine.</p>
<p>In return for your support, we have also teamed up with a few local businesses to give you discounts with more to come soon!</p>
<p>10% off at <a href=""https://www.rebornrewild.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Reborn Rewild</a> - 100% vegan eco-friendly bags</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>At present in the UK there are approximately 20 million gym goers out of 70 million population, not including those who prefer a home gym workout, of which our machines are perfect for with regard to the current pandemic.</p>
<p>If a gym had 10 GENergy machines and 10 people used it for 1 hour each 7 days per week and they all produced 100 watts of energy in that hour.</p>
<p>10(machines) x 10(people) x 365(days) x 100(watts)</p>
<p>100 people x 100 watts= 10000 watts</p>
<p>In 1 year that would equate to 365 MW</p>
<p>That would equate to £ 547.50  (if it was charged at 15 p per kWh) payback per year.</p>
<p>Plus you would not need to power the machines from the grid, so there would be a saving there also!</p>
<p>Can you imagine if there were 100 or 1000 GENergy machines out there? The electrical saving from the power grid would be huge!</p>

</div></div>","I am Phil Vaughan, a 54 year old electrical/mechanical engineer who in a career break between 2001 and 2006, undertook various courses on physical training and exercise.
I ran a gym through this time (L.I.P.S. Leap Into Perfect Shape) based in Stubbington Avenue, North End, Portsmouth, UK. A very popular private gymnasium.
It was at this point that my imagination was sparked to work on the possibility of transferring physical energy into electrical energy mainly due to the high electrical costs of running the place.
My gym days ceased in 2006 and I went back to my apprentice trained occupation but the thought never went away.
As time went by with running being my main physical exercise (many Great South Runs in Portsmouth, of course) a  medical fault occurred that would curtail my running and push me back into gym work to continue my life health.
The problem was a ""first degree, heart block"" which sounds severe and potentially could have been a heart attack, if I hadn't been as physically fit as I was, at the time!
My prognosis (according to the cardiologist) was to stay as cardio vascularly fit as you are now, for as long as you can otherwise they will need to install a pacemaker! Yikes.
So a plan formulated a few years ago to carry out the physical energy to electrical energy transfer by buying bits that were affordable and use my experience to produce a machine that will keep me fit and charge phones, ipads, computers, LEDs, charge batteries and put power back into the house.
I now have a product that works (prototype) but it can be made a lot better and more efficient with some financial and specialist assistance.

 
What We Need & What You Get
Our GEN-Ergy project is in its infancy (stage 1-completed) where I have invested over £13,000 to get to the prototype stage whereby the system works and I train on it 5 days a week. We are extremely close to completing stage 2 to create a more mobile structure. If you are interested, follow our journey through our social channels:
 
Human GEN ergy on YouTube
HumanGENergy on Facebook
 
We need your help to take our HumanGENergy Project through the next 2 stages! Right now we are fundraising for £10,000 to take us to stage 3 to get specialist electronic help to make the system as efficient as we can to get even more electrical power output!
Stage 4 requires additional funding to use the technology we will have perfected with our air stepper and replicate it for other fitness apparatus such as cross trainers, bicycles and rowing machines. 
 
Return for your Investment
For every £ 100 raised I will give you a 30 minute training set on the GENergy machine, with me (the inventor) so you can have your ""Frankenstein moment"" where you can see your physical effort turn into useful electricity to power, operating iphones, ipads, battery chargers, light LEDs or charging power back into the house!
When we get the full money raised across each stage, anyone who has invested will get their money they have invested with us off of the full production GEN-ergy machine.
In return for your support, we have also teamed up with a few local businesses to give you discounts with more to come soon!

The Impact
At present in the UK there are approximately 20 million gym goers out of 70 million population, not including those who prefer a home gym workout, of which our machines are perfect for with regard to the current pandemic.
If a gym had 10 GENergy machines and 10 people used it for 1 hour each 7 days per week and they all produced 100 watts of energy in that hour.
10(machines) x 10(people) x 365(days) x 100(watts)
100 people x 100 watts= 10000 watts
In 1 year that would equate to 365 MW
That would equate to £ 547.50  (if it was charged at 15 p per kWh) payback per year.
Plus you would not need to power the machines from the grid, so there would be a saving there also!
Can you imagine if there were 100 or 1000 GENergy machines out there? The electrical saving from the power grid would be huge!
 
Risks & Challenges
We live with risk everyday.
Getting out of bed is risky!
Crossing the road is risky!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>LINA PAC’s essence is to obtain an alternative to Evaporation Air Coolers and conventional air conditioners with lower power consumption 34 W/hr, water consumption, better mobility options and environment friendly operation.<br/>it doesn't need to cold water or ice like the swamp type air coolers, it only needs tape water.</p>
<p>With the guarantee of the German labs experimentation you can have the amazing cooling effect that can reduce the air temperature from 37°C to 18°C at a humidity level of 25% and from 33°C to 23°C at a humidity level of 80% at your hands with our units that are surprisingly very compact and mobile that you can take it with you wherever you go inside the house or even when travelling.<br/><a href=""https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GXlhNPkZv6hmavaRAYPRi6Tgn7ypSE0z/view?usp=sharing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GXlhNPkZv6hmavaRAYPRi6Tgn7ypSE0z/view?usp=sharing</a></p>
<p>Being a simulation for nature as the air stream of the sea beach, LINA PAC is considered an Environment friendly alternative solution for conventional A/C as a personal air conditioner that does not use a refrigerant substance (Freon) that can harm the environment also it does not have any source of bacteria such as pads or water cartridges like in other Evaporative Air Coolers.</p>
<p>The secret behind the lower power consumption is spots the cooled air directly on the person not the environment surrounding him using centrifugal fan with high dynamic pressure delivering a conical airflow that strike the conical flow of the dry ice fog cooling effect which has particle size 3 micron which produce huge amount of cooling surface area between the air flow and the fog achieving efficient cooling through a range of 1.5 meter long.<br/>The extremely small “3-micron” water droplet radius allows a full water consumption by the air stream therefor granting a superior and a much more efficient cooling effect.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Target</h3>
<p>We ask for your support to reach to 300,000$ which cover the components and the following,<br/>we've a one production line. this production line has the capacity 2000 Unit per day, which means 50,000 Unit per month. <br/>Our target, <strong>firstly</strong>, is to build two new production lines, which will reduce the selling price by increasing the products amount<br/><br/><strong>Secondly</strong>, Our aim is to cover the whole world with Lina-PAC 2018-20 devices. We hope that every one to be able to own his/her personal air conditioner. <strong>At this point</strong>, We'll save 95% from the 49% of the total power consumption by the traditional air conditioner around the world. That will result reducing the CO2 emissions around the world and also our Lina-PAC product will enhance the healthy life for each person around the world by adding honey, lemon droplets and peppermint.<br/><br/><strong>IF WE DIDN'T REACH OUR TARGET ...</strong><br/>We'll feed the money for increasing the productivity in our production line.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>In 2016, we had some problems in the first generation of Lina-PAC 2016, like, that <strong>the face which carry the fan</strong> was fixed not movable and we modified it into a movable face to be suitable for short or tall persons during sleeping or sitting also we had a problem with<strong> the hand of the water tank</strong>, and we developed it and now the problem is solved. <strong>the push buttons</strong> in Lina-PAC 2016 was press buttons, now it became touch buttons. <strong>the ceramic diaphragm pump and the PCB were with no heat sink</strong>, but now the two devices has been manufactured with heat sink.<strong> the dynamic pressure</strong> of Lina-PAC 2016 was lower than Lina-PAC 2018-20 so Lina-PAC 2018-20 can reach to lower temperature even the relative humidity reach to 80% and can cool 2 persons on the bed, but Lina-PAC 2016 was assigned to cool only 1 person.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Do you hate wasting food? So do we!</h3>
<p>The average American family wastes up to $2,200 worth of food per year in the US. This is not an epidemic confined to North America, it is global and has global consequences. I realized how much food was going to waste in my own home and thought: there has to be a better way, a tool to help us be more efficient with the food we bring into our homes. That is how the WasteNot App was born.</p>
<p>If we are all more efficient at home we can help make a positive impact by reducing our contribution to food waste. Food wasted in our homes is the worst kind of waste: this is quality product that has made its way through the supply chain and arrived at its final destination, ready to nourish. </p>
<p>I got together with award-winning software development company <strong><a href=""https://artandlogic.com/mobile-development/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Art + Logic</a> </strong>to design an easy to use mobile app that would reduce food waste at home and help users' impact on the environment and their finances. We have come up with the design and flow of the app, now we just need your help to make WasteNot a reality.</p>

If we are all more efficient at home we can help make a positive impact by reducing our contribution to food waste. Food wasted in our homes is the worst kind of waste: this is quality product that has made its way through the supply chain and arrived at its final destination, ready to nourish. 
I got together with award-winning software development company Art + Logic to design an easy to use mobile app that would reduce food waste at home and help users' impact on the environment and their finances. We have come up with the design and flow of the app, now we just need your help to make WasteNot a reality.

Help us create the WasteNot App, 
Join the #NoFoodWaste Revolution and become a WasteWarrior.

Risks & Challenges
We already have the design and functionality of the App designed as demonstrated above and throughout this campaign. We need to raise the remaining funds for the completion and delivery of the App as well as for marketing and expanded partnerships. We are committed to delivering the App in January 2019 if we are able to raise the funds for the App. We are a fixed funded campaign and need to raise at least $50K to deliver partner awards and $80K to successfully develop and deliver the WasteNot App by January 2019. Please help us make this happen!",15.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>BUSINESS SUMMARY</p>
<p>El Huerto Hidropónico – Lima , es una propuesta que consiste en la producción de verduras y hortalizas en la ciudad de Lima.</p>
<p>Escogimos esta ciudad ya que actualmente las verduras que consumimos son contaminadas y ello afecta a la salud de toda la población, en especial la más vulnerable como niños y ancianos.</p>
<p>Somos aproximadamente 10 millones de peruanos que consumimos verduras regadas con agua de desagüe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nos apoyaremos en una técnica milenaria llamada Hidroponía, la cual consiste en producir vegetales en sistema flotantes con nutrientes.</p>
<p>Este sistema permite ahorrar el 90% de uso de agua, no interviene el uso de insecticidas y fertilizantes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Actualmente acceder a cultivos hidropónicos es muy caro y poco difundido, por tanto, queremos iniciar la producción y masificación que permita que muchas más personas puedan consumir productos de calidad</p>
<p> </p>
<p>WHY ARE YOU THE RIGHT TEAM TO RUN THE PROJECT?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Somos un equipo de profesionales que cree que es posible cambiar la forma insalubre de alimentación que tienen los limeños.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Utilizaremos nuestra experiencia en área administrativa, financiera, atención al cliente y habilidades que complementan para lograr que este proyecto llegue a ser una realidad.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>CUSTOMER PROBLEM</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Comer verduras saludables en Lima es un lujo,  10 millones de personas vivimos en un desierto y durante décadas se ha usado agua no potable para regar las plantaciones.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>En la actualidad el 63.3% de la muestra de lechugas tomadas en los puntos de ventas de los mercados peruanos presentaron contaminación con larvas de Strongyloides. En comparación en otros países muestran un elevado porcentaje de detección comparado con los estudios realizados en mercados populares de Venezuela, en Maracaibo (40 %); en el Estado de Bolívar (15,7 %); mientras que, en los mercados de Corrientes, Argentina, se reporta un nivel sumamente bajo (2 %) de lechugas contaminadas por larvas de Strongyloides.</p>
<p>La mayor parte contaminación de este vegetal obedece a que son regadas con aguas servidas o aguas contaminadas con restos fecales. A ello también contribuye el hecho que, muchas veces, los campos de cultivo son abonados con estiércol y materia orgánica de origen fecal (compost y restos de heces de ganado).</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>THE SOLUTION</p>
<p>El Huerto Hidropónico – Lima se encargará de la producción de verduras, desde la siembra hasta la cosecha, asegurando la calidad e higiene.</p>
<p>Todos nuestros procesos serán supervisados por especialistas de Hidroponía que garantizarán la inocuidad de todas las cosechas.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>BUSINESS MODEL: HOW YOU MAKE MONEY?</p>
<p>Enviaremos todas nuestras cosechas a los restaurantes afiliados, supermercados y puntos de venta ( bodegas).</p>
<p>Nuestro trabajo de concientización e información debe llegar a todo nuestro mercado objetivo, luego debemos hacer llegar nuestros productos a todas las zonas mediante distribuidores autorizados.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>MARKET &amp; COMPETITORS</p>
<p>El mercado que atenderemos es a personas que deseen empezar una alimentación sana.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>MAJOR IDENTIFIED RISKS</p>
<p>Riesgos:</p>
<p>Aperturas de restaurantes que realicen ventas de lechugas hidropónicas</p>
<p>No llegar a nuestra rentabilidad deseada.</p>
<p>No contar con el apoyo de las entidades de Salud en Lima.</p>
<p>Solución:</p>
<p>Contar con un personal calificado en la elaboración de agricultura hidropónicas</p>
<p>Publicaciones de boletines informativos a nuestro público objetivo.</p>
<p>Contar con un área postventa del servicio que ofrecemos.</p>
<p>Alimentos libres de contaminación cruzada.</p>

</div></div>","BUSINESS SUMMARY
El Huerto Hidropónico – Lima , es una propuesta que consiste en la producción de verduras y hortalizas en la ciudad de Lima.
Escogimos esta ciudad ya que actualmente las verduras que consumimos son contaminadas y ello afecta a la salud de toda la población, en especial la más vulnerable como niños y ancianos.
Somos aproximadamente 10 millones de peruanos que consumimos verduras regadas con agua de desagüe.
 
Nos apoyaremos en una técnica milenaria llamada Hidroponía, la cual consiste en producir vegetales en sistema flotantes con nutrientes.
Este sistema permite ahorrar el 90% de uso de agua, no interviene el uso de insecticidas y fertilizantes.
 
Actualmente acceder a cultivos hidropónicos es muy caro y poco difundido, por tanto, queremos iniciar la producción y masificación que permita que muchas más personas puedan consumir productos de calidad
 
WHY ARE YOU THE RIGHT TEAM TO RUN THE PROJECT?
 
Somos un equipo de profesionales que cree que es posible cambiar la forma insalubre de alimentación que tienen los limeños.
 
Utilizaremos nuestra experiencia en área administrativa, financiera, atención al cliente y habilidades que complementan para lograr que este proyecto llegue a ser una realidad.
 
 
CUSTOMER PROBLEM
 
Comer verduras saludables en Lima es un lujo,  10 millones de personas vivimos en un desierto y durante décadas se ha usado agua no potable para regar las plantaciones.
 
En la actualidad el 63.3% de la muestra de lechugas tomadas en los puntos de ventas de los mercados peruanos presentaron contaminación con larvas de Strongyloides. En comparación en otros países muestran un elevado porcentaje de detección comparado con los estudios realizados en mercados populares de Venezuela, en Maracaibo (40 %); en el Estado de Bolívar (15,7 %); mientras que, en los mercados de Corrientes, Argentina, se reporta un nivel sumamente bajo (2 %) de lechugas contaminadas por larvas de Strongyloides.
La mayor parte contaminación de este vegetal obedece a que son regadas con aguas servidas o aguas contaminadas con restos fecales. A ello también contribuye el hecho que, muchas veces, los campos de cultivo son abonados con estiércol y materia orgánica de origen fecal (compost y restos de heces de ganado).
 
 
THE SOLUTION
El Huerto Hidropónico – Lima se encargará de la producción de verduras, desde la siembra hasta la cosecha, asegurando la calidad e higiene.
Todos nuestros procesos serán supervisados por especialistas de Hidroponía que garantizarán la inocuidad de todas las cosechas.
 
 
 
 
 
 
BUSINESS MODEL: HOW YOU MAKE MONEY?
Enviaremos todas nuestras cosechas a los restaurantes afiliados, supermercados y puntos de venta ( bodegas).
Nuestro trabajo de concientización e información debe llegar a todo nuestro mercado objetivo, luego debemos hacer llegar nuestros productos a todas las zonas mediante distribuidores autorizados.
 
 
 
 
MARKET & COMPETITORS
El mercado que atenderemos es a personas que deseen empezar una alimentación sana.
