<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As an occupational therapist with over 35 years of experience, I have watched child after child on the autism spectrum struggle to master simple writing tasks .  Failing again and again at writing their name or a few letters of the alphabet,  they came to hate handwriting tasks and gave up.  Required paper and pencil tasks  became anxiety producing.  Students often acted out or were placed off to the side with an adult doing an unrelated task that did not involve handwriting.  Sometimes they were left to stare at the page or interrupt someone else's work because they just could not do what they were asked to do - even if that meant just writing their name.  An assumption was often made that they just did not have the intellectual ability to write or didn't have any thoughts worthy of expression.  I spent hours upon hours at home trying to create games, work sheets, songs and anything else I could think of to engage my students in handwriting tasks.  I went to all the workshops and tried all the methods.  None of it worked very well or very consistently with my diverse group of students.</p>
<p>A few years ago I was able to focus my efforts on the preschool population in classrooms with children on the autism spectrum and with other developmental disabilities.  They were 3-5 years old and most started out nonverbal with attention spans less than 10 seconds for any activity.  Many could not sit in a chair or hold a paintbrush or take off their jacket.  Absolutely nothing I had ever done in the past was working with these little guys.  And that is when it hit me.  It would never work.  It couldn't.  None of the ""evidence based""  shape-first, single letter, sequential word building methods would ever work.  Those methods were developed for neurotypical children who did not have the same challenges as children born with an autistic brain.</p>
<p>So I threw away everything I had tried before, everything I had been taught for decades about the ""right"" way to teach handwriting.  I did what I knew my kids with ASD would respond to.  I stepped into their world and their way of learning and only asked them to do what they could.  And it worked!  No more laborious work trying to make the perfect ""A"" or focusing on only writing their name because that is what the common core says they have to do in kindergarten.  My students were writing words they had not yet learned to say!  By using language-limited, natural strokes, and focusing on writing whole words in connected script, my little guys were writing their names and object names like ""car"" and ""ball"".  One student even was able to write ""help"" when he needed it.  Those accomplishments exceed what the common core requires for neurotypical students entering kindergarten!</p>
<p>We know from current research that handwriting has very specific effects on the brain.  It is related to literacy later in life, especially when a child can write their name prior to kindergarten, errors and all.  We know that children with high functioning autism that are included in general education classrooms expend so much energy and time on handwriting that it can interfere with their ability to participate in other classroom tasks.  We know that neurologists are looking into the relationship between handwriting difficulties and socialization difficulties in children with ASD.</p>
<p>And we know one other thing.  The Write Connections method works.  Together we can limit the stress, the failure and the unnecessary struggle that so many children on the autism spectrum experience as they fall farther and farther behind in this crucial visual motor skill.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to develop the materials for teachers, therapists, parents, or anyone else who needs them to use.  We have to hire illustrators to make many very specific worksheets and characters.  We need to lay out the ""how-to"" of the method in a Kindle/e-book so therapists, teachers and others will have the confidence and the information to use The Write Connections method to make their students successful and proud of their work. </p>
<p>Other methods charge $15 to $20 per booklet per student.  We want to make our materials more widely available by offering them in various combinations on our website as downloadable pdfs that can be copied and used with the buyer's own students or for personal use (but not commercially).  That is going to save school districts, teachers, parents and everyone else a lot of money.  We want people to have easy access so they can use it and see how effective it is.  Our goal is to change the system for children on the autism spectrum and for any child who has difficulty with handwriting.  The Write Connections method is so effective, straight forward and simple that it is also a great way for any child to learn handwriting.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Supporting our campaign is a direct line to supporting the autism community and children on the autism spectrum everywhere.  The first time one of my functionally nonverbal 4-year-old students wrote the word ""car"" when choosing between a ball and a car I cried!  He looked at me as if  to say ""no big deal""'  but it IS a big deal!  He had made the connection between handwriting and communication, was able to retain the visual image in his mind and execute a complex fine motor task!  That was huge!  And he was only 4-years-old with a 20 word spoken vocabulary that he could not rely on to work consistently. But he could write to request a toy!  You can have that impact too!  Support our campaign and help children on the autism spectrum show us what they have to say.</p>

<p>The main challenge right now is getting the word out.  Once the materials are developed we will be able to step up our efforts to educate therapists, teachers, administrators, parents and others about the method.  We need to get approval from the American Occupational Therapy Association as a continuing education provider.  We are already in talks to partner on a peer reviewed research study of our method.  Each one of these exciting challenges will further establish The Write Connections as the go-to handwriting instruction method for children on the autism spectrum.   Angela Sarno, the founder and creator of the method, is well prepared to continue moving forward on this journey.  She started her career in a pediatric diagnostic center and has over 35 years of clinical experience.  She has experience in corporate rehabilitation management, regional program development, rehabilitation services marketing and education.  She is a former author of the National Board of Certification in Occupational Therapy examination for occupational therapists and assistants in the United States.  Come join us and help Angela make The Write Connections method available for every child with ASD!</p>

A few years ago I was able to focus my efforts on the preschool population in classrooms with children on the autism spectrum and with other developmental disabilities.  They were 3-5 years old and most started out nonverbal with attention spans less than 10 seconds for any activity.  Many could not sit in a chair or hold a paintbrush or take off their jacket.  Absolutely nothing I had ever done in the past was working with these little guys.  And that is when it hit me.  It would never work.  It couldn't.  None of the ""evidence based""  shape-first, single letter, sequential word building methods would ever work.  Those methods were developed for neurotypical children who did not have the same challenges as children born with an autistic brain.
So I threw away everything I had tried before, everything I had been taught for decades about the ""right"" way to teach handwriting.  I did what I knew my kids with ASD would respond to.  I stepped into their world and their way of learning and only asked them to do what they could.  And it worked!  No more laborious work trying to make the perfect ""A"" or focusing on only writing their name because that is what the common core says they have to do in kindergarten.  My students were writing words they had not yet learned to say!  By using language-limited, natural strokes, and focusing on writing whole words in connected script, my little guys were writing their names and object names like ""car"" and ""ball"".  One student even was able to write ""help"" when he needed it.  Those accomplishments exceed what the common core requires for neurotypical students entering kindergarten!
We know from current research that handwriting has very specific effects on the brain.  It is related to literacy later in life, especially when a child can write their name prior to kindergarten, errors and all.  We know that children with high functioning autism that are included in general education classrooms expend so much energy and time on handwriting that it can interfere with their ability to participate in other classroom tasks.  We know that neurologists are looking into the relationship between handwriting difficulties and socialization difficulties in children with ASD.
And we know one other thing.  The Write Connections method works.  Together we can limit the stress, the failure and the unnecessary struggle that so many children on the autism spectrum experience as they fall farther and farther behind in this crucial visual motor skill.
 

What We Need & What You Get
We need to develop the materials for teachers, therapists, parents, or anyone else who needs them to use.  We have to hire illustrators to make many very specific worksheets and characters.  We need to lay out the ""how-to"" of the method in a Kindle/e-book so therapists, teachers and others will have the confidence and the information to use The Write Connections method to make their students successful and proud of their work. 
Other methods charge $15 to $20 per booklet per student.  We want to make our materials more widely available by offering them in various combinations on our website as downloadable pdfs that can be copied and used with the buyer's own students or for personal use (but not commercially).  That is going to save school districts, teachers, parents and everyone else a lot of money.  We want people to have easy access so they can use it and see how effective it is.  Our goal is to change the system for children on the autism spectrum and for any child who has difficulty with handwriting.  The Write Connections method is so effective, straight forward and simple that it is also a great way for any child to learn handwriting.

<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The time when people of Nepal were still carrying heavy bags and spending so much money on books we had a clear idea of teaching people without books but with free content. With first level completed, we have informed students that they can learn using online content. Also school can use software With the completion of this project, we will be creating a new pattern for gaining knowledge. The traditional method of teaching that is mostly based on feeding information to children will shift to helping the children to learn as per their capacity. Education will help the children foster their inner talent and show it to the world. Now children will not think education as a burden of their life rather they will enjoy the process of learning. Every children's dream will come true through our platform. We will create a society that has educated members working together to create a better world to live.</p>
<p>We will unite the world under one roof through the universal educational platform.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>This is a huge project that is going to benefit society as a whole. We need your support to create a civilized society where education is not limited to an institution or single teacher. This is not only for us but for our future generation. If you cannot donate, it does not matter you can share and spread the word.</p>

</div></div>","As we advance in technology, each component of technology was deemed to revolutionize the educational system. Radio to television to computer to internet and now virtual reality but none proved to be effective. In the era of global network and vast ocean of information at our fingertips we cannot use them to create an effective system to educate people. Are these technologies really incapable of revolutionizing the educational system of this world? We don't think so.

<h3>The Story Behind the Notebook </h3>
<p>I've been a High School and Middle School Science Teacher for 14 years. As a teacher, I want my students to excel. I want them to be confident in their ability to understand and learn anything. The subjects I teach might be important, but there is one thing that I will always care more about: <strong>Teaching My Students Skills</strong> <strong>That Will Help Them All Their Life. </strong></p>
<p>Being able to learn anything is one such skill. But you have to have the right tools and guidance.</p>
<p>Over the years, I've encountered many hard-working and dedicated students who experience a lot of frustration in tough classes such as Chemistry, Physics, or Math. If you are a diligent student trying very hard to do well, but you are unsuccessful, it is understandable that you'll be frustrated. I noticed this frustration and decided to do something about it. </p>
<p>Because implanting you with a chip and uploading the information directly to your brain has not been invented yet, I came up with the Cornell Notes on Steroids Template and put it inside a notebook. </p>
<p>It is a comprehensive school tool that improves organization, focus, note-taking, and study skills. It is designed for student success. It is designed to help students learn.</p>
<h3>What's Inside?</h3>
<ul><li>The Cornell Notes on Steroids Notebook is a 8.5""x11"" 120-page high quality academic notebook that contains an organizational template you can use while taking notes during a lecture, reading, or another class or home work activity.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>The notebook comes in 2 colors, black with black coil binding or planetary purple with white binding (only 100 bundles of 3 of blue are available).</li>
<li>The front cover is laminated on both sides to make it durable, waterproof, and stain resistant.</li>
<li>The coil binding is made from durable plastic which looks better and does not deform as wire coil binding does.</li>
<li>The Cornell Notes of Steroids Template is designed for 2-sided writing. To prevent ink bleeding through, the Focus Notebook uses 50-lb paper, which is more than 3 times thicker than the 16-lb paper most notebook manufacturers use.</li>
<li>All 60 sheets are made from eucalyptus by Suzano Pulp and Paper, which is a manufacturer committed to a sustainable way of producing paper.</li>

<h3>How will the funds be used?</h3>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>1. The Cornell Notes on Steroids Notebook is an organizational tool and a method of teaching and learning that decreases frustration and increases student success in any subject. As with all tools, the user needs to use this unique notebook properly to maximize its effectiveness. I believe that the notebook’s organization, space definition, and prompts provide an easy-to-follow method making the notebook a user-friendly and attractive learning tool. But, to make sure that everyone can optimize their teaching and learning using the notebook, I will provide everyone who buys a bundle with a link to the instructional ""How To"" video. </p>
<p>2. I want everyone to have the ability to purchase the Cornell Notes on Steroids Notebook, because I know it can be a game changer. But if you are not ready yet, I am making the PDF of the template available to anyone who pledges $1 and I will provide you with a link to the instructional ""How To"" video.</p>
<p>3. If you are a student looking to be more organized and successful, or a parent looking to provide your child with a better academic tool, or a teacher seeking to add to your best practices arsenal, or an administrator looking to raise student achievement, please join me in making the Cornell Notes on Steroids Notebook a reality and pledge now. Thank you. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always challenges associated with bringing a new product to life. However, I already have a small inventory of the notebooks. The printer I chose and have been working with closely has the equipment, the know how, and the experience necessary for the project to be successful. The printing press plates are made. The paper and cover stock are ready to go.</p>
<p>I also have thoroughly researched and have a shipping infrastructure in place, so the notebooks can be shipped as soon as they are manufactured.</p>
<p>I promise you that I will work hard to make sure that you receive the highest quality product possible as soon as possible. Thank you for your support and trust!</p>

<h3>Why I believe the film, theater, stunt, tactical and entertainment world needs this material!</h3>
<p>Hi, My name is Gina Vincenza aka Psycho Seamstress and I am a costume rigging expert, who has been doing Quick Change Clothing Alterations since 2011. I quit my ""day job"" in 2013 and have been making a professional living designing, styling, sewing, consulting, teaching and managing design and sewing related projects in costume and fashion.</p>
<p>Here's the Reader's Digest Version of me, my experience and this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>My A List and Celebrity clients have included top names like Beyonce, Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus, Rihanna, Pink, Paul McCartney, Janet Jackson, Michael Jackson's  Immortal Cirque du Soleil and MORE. Most of the alterations I've done for their concert tours, were for quick change rigging and to convert off the rack fashion into dance costumes by adding gussets, consolidating layered garments into one quick changeable item and to prevent onstage wardrobe malfunctions, like rigging the button fly of a very famous performer's designer DSquared Tuxedo pants, so his audience could't see his underwear anymore!!</li>
<li>I was recently featured in Beyonce's Behind The Scenes Fashion Video on her Formation World Tour, talking about what we were doing to convert her Designer Balmain Bodysuits from High Fashion into Dance Costumes. <a href=""https://youtu.be/-INfSklAd_I"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/-INfSklAd_I</a>  (Yes... I do know the difference between a dart and a gusset, but I was ambushed by a camera man and got flustered!)</li>
<li>Some of the Theater Shows I've done costume rigging for have included Guys and Dolls, Sister Act, Peter Pan, Hair, Mama Mia, Cirque du Soleil, Mel Brook's Young Frankenstein and more including on stage live quick changes, rigging, hats, wigs and shoes.</li>
<li>I've worked on films doing costume rigging for scenes and created distressed / destroyed multiple sets of identical costumes for continuity. </li>
<li>I've been working as a Costume Fabrication Specialist at Universal Theme Parks since 2014. There, I do a lot of Costume Rigging on Marvel, Harry Potter, Seuss, Sindbad, Parade, Event, Stilt Walker and many other performer costumes throughout both parks. Being in Florida and working with out door performers, I do a lot of rigging that reduces the layering on garments, adds mesh panels where fabric would be and other things to keep the performer cooler. </li>
<li>Among my private clients, I've made special garments for illusionists, strippers, ice skaters, aerialists, drag queens and more.</li>
<li>I've done tactical rigging on civilian clothes for law enforcement and business suit wearing security teams. I am working with ex-military personnel on a clothing line that allows for quick access to concealed weapons (Quick Draw Clothing) in clothing that looks normal and has no tell tale signs of being military or law enforcement.</li>
<li>I have been writing online on the subject of Costume Rigging for a few years now, on my PsychoSeamstress.com Blog and on other Social Media platforms including Control Room, Instructables, Pinterest and Instagram.</li>
<li>If you google ""costume rigging"" a lot of what comes up was written by me and because of this, people email me on a regular basis for help and advice on their rigging dilemmas. </li>
<li>There are no books, that I can find on the subject of costume rigging, which is why I have been threatening to write this book for years!!</li>
<li>My goal is to provide a comprehensive first edition, but offer additional and an ongoing series of costume rigging techniques, tips and tricks, which can be added later via subscription and revised editions.</li>
<li>I started a facebook group entitled ""Costume Rigging Tips &amp; Tricks"" and a launched a website with a blog at <a href=""http://www.costumerigging.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.costumerigging.com</a>.</li>
<li>So far, the response has been immediate and overwhelming and after launching these sites, I have gathered the names of many people around the world, who are interested in helping me make this happen by sharing their behind the scenes secrets to costume rigging as well!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here is the plan for getting the first edition of this comprehensive guide together:</p>
<ul><li>Create a List of the Top Most Common or Most Wanted Techniques using my current social media for polling and feedback from my core supporters. I'd love to hear from all of you on that!!</li></ul>
<p>Some of the possible content will be:</p>
<ol>
<li>basic costume rigging</li>
<li>uncommon costume rigging</li>
<li>removable rigging for rented or borrowed items</li>
<li>merging garments into one for quick change</li>
<li>shoe and boot alterations</li>
<li>millinery alterations</li>
<li>wig tips and tricks</li>
<li>fire stunt rigging</li>
<li>water stunt rigging</li>
<li>stilt walker rigging</li>
<li>aerial costume rigging</li>
<li>tactical rigging</li>
<li>live watchable quick change rigging (usually a spinning quick change)</li>
<li>high speed quick change rigging (where an object passes in front of the performer and they are wearing a different outfit)</li>
<li>illusionist rigging</li>
<li>to add to this list, please visit <a href=""http://www.costumerigging.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.costumerigging.com</a>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Illustrate each alteration using actual fabric, materials and garments to show a before and after, along with a step by step photo illustrated, written and video recorded guide on how it's done.</li>
<li>I estimate, if I prepare, perform, photograph, videotape and document one or more alterations per day at 5 per week, it should give or take about 10-12 weeks complete the whole project including editing, if fully funded.</li>
<li>I'd like to have everything ready to ship out books by Spring 2017 </li>
<li>I'll need funding for a Photographer to shoot all the photo images, who's time will coincide with mine and take additional hours to edit photos.</li>
<li>I'll need funding for a Videographer to shoot all the video footage, who's time will coincide with mine and take additional hours to edit footage and format it into an organized manner. (I realize I may be able to consolidate this into using one person to do both the photos and video or I may be able to buy a camera or two and tripod set up to do it all my self and possibly use the video to pull out the still images)</li>
<li>Funds for <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Graphic Designer to lay everything out in an easy to understand book format, suitable for teaching.</span>
</li>
<li>I will need to write the step by step dialog for each alteration and include some possible variations of the same. ie velcro, vs snaps, vs magnets options</li>
<li>I've found a company who can print books on demand in soft and hard cover editions.</li>
<li>I will need funds to set up an LLC for this project.</li>
<li>Funds for any other Legal Fees as needed to Legally Produce This Publication</li>
<li>Funds to set up the online distributions sites, so people can find and order this book online.</li>
<li>Any additional funds raised will be used for Marketing and Administration beyond this campaign, to get started on adding new material and automating systems that will allow me to be more productive. Thanks to <a href=""http://www.fourhourworkweek.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.fourhourworkweek.com</a> for giving all the resources I've used to take this project this far!</li>

</div><p>And that's all there is to it!</p></div>","Why I believe the film, theater, stunt, tactical and entertainment world needs this material!
Hi, My name is Gina Vincenza aka Psycho Seamstress and I am a costume rigging expert, who has been doing Quick Change Clothing Alterations since 2011. I quit my ""day job"" in 2013 and have been making a professional living designing, styling, sewing, consulting, teaching and managing design and sewing related projects in costume and fashion.
Here's the Reader's Digest Version of me, my experience and this project:

My A List and Celebrity clients have included top names like Beyonce, Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus, Rihanna, Pink, Paul McCartney, Janet Jackson, Michael Jackson's  Immortal Cirque du Soleil and MORE. Most of the alterations I've done for their concert tours, were for quick change rigging and to convert off the rack fashion into dance costumes by adding gussets, consolidating layered garments into one quick changeable item and to prevent onstage wardrobe malfunctions, like rigging the button fly of a very famous performer's designer DSquared Tuxedo pants, so his audience could't see his underwear anymore!!
I was recently featured in Beyonce's Behind The Scenes Fashion Video on her Formation World Tour, talking about what we were doing to convert her Designer Balmain Bodysuits from High Fashion into Dance Costumes. https://youtu.be/-INfSklAd_I  (Yes... I do know the difference between a dart and a gusset, but I was ambushed by a camera man and got flustered!)
Some of the Theater Shows I've done costume rigging for have included Guys and Dolls, Sister Act, Peter Pan, Hair, Mama Mia, Cirque du Soleil, Mel Brook's Young Frankenstein and more including on stage live quick changes, rigging, hats, wigs and shoes.
I've worked on films doing costume rigging for scenes and created distressed / destroyed multiple sets of identical costumes for continuity. 
I've been working as a Costume Fabrication Specialist at Universal Theme Parks since 2014. There, I do a lot of Costume Rigging on Marvel, Harry Potter, Seuss, Sindbad, Parade, Event, Stilt Walker and many other performer costumes throughout both parks. Being in Florida and working with out door performers, I do a lot of rigging that reduces the layering on garments, adds mesh panels where fabric would be and other things to keep the performer cooler. 
Among my private clients, I've made special garments for illusionists, strippers, ice skaters, aerialists, drag queens and more.
I've done tactical rigging on civilian clothes for law enforcement and business suit wearing security teams. I am working with ex-military personnel on a clothing line that allows for quick access to concealed weapons (Quick Draw Clothing) in clothing that looks normal and has no tell tale signs of being military or law enforcement.
I have been writing online on the subject of Costume Rigging for a few years now, on my PsychoSeamstress.com Blog and on other Social Media platforms including Control Room, Instructables, Pinterest and Instagram.
If you google ""costume rigging"" a lot of what comes up was written by me and because of this, people email me on a regular basis for help and advice on their rigging dilemmas. 
There are no books, that I can find on the subject of costume rigging, which is why I have been threatening to write this book for years!!
My goal is to provide a comprehensive first edition, but offer additional and an ongoing series of costume rigging techniques, tips and tricks, which can be added later via subscription and revised editions.
I started a facebook group entitled ""Costume Rigging Tips & Tricks"" and a launched a website with a blog at www.costumerigging.com.
So far, the response has been immediate and overwhelming and after launching these sites, I have gathered the names of many people around the world, who are interested in helping me make this happen by sharing their behind the scenes secrets to costume rigging as well!


What I Need & What You Get
Here is the plan for getting the first edition of this comprehensive guide together:
Create a List of the Top Most Common or Most Wanted Techniques using my current social media for polling and feedback from my core supporters. I'd love to hear from all of you on that!!
Some of the possible content will be:

basic costume rigging
uncommon costume rigging
removable rigging for rented or borrowed items
merging garments into one for quick change
shoe and boot alterations
millinery alterations
wig tips and tricks
fire stunt rigging
water stunt rigging
stilt walker rigging
aerial costume rigging
tactical rigging
live watchable quick change rigging (usually a spinning quick change)
high speed quick change rigging (where an object passes in front of the performer and they are wearing a different outfit)
illusionist rigging
to add to this list, please visit www.costumerigging.com



Illustrate each alteration using actual fabric, materials and garments to show a before and after, along with a step by step photo illustrated, written and video recorded guide on how it's done.
I estimate, if I prepare, perform, photograph, videotape and document one or more alterations per day at 5 per week, it should give or take about 10-12 weeks complete the whole project including editing, if fully funded.
I'd like to have everything ready to ship out books by Spring 2017 
I'll need funding for a Photographer to shoot all the photo images, who's time will coincide with mine and take additional hours to edit photos.
I'll need funding for a Videographer to shoot all the video footage, who's time will coincide with mine and take additional hours to edit footage and format it into an organized manner. (I realize I may be able to consolidate this into using one person to do both the photos and video or I may be able to buy a camera or two and tripod set up to do it all my self and possibly use the video to pull out the still images)
Funds for Graphic Designer to lay everything out in an easy to understand book format, suitable for teaching.

I will need to write the step by step dialog for each alteration and include some possible variations of the same. ie velcro, vs snaps, vs magnets options
I've found a company who can print books on demand in soft and hard cover editions.
I will need funds to set up an LLC for this project.
Funds for any other Legal Fees as needed to Legally Produce This Publication
Funds to set up the online distributions sites, so people can find and order this book online.
Any additional funds raised will be used for Marketing and Administration beyond this campaign, to get started on adding new material and automating systems that will allow me to be more productive. Thanks to www.fourhourworkweek.com for giving all the resources I've used to take this project this far!

<p>My mugs are not just for kids. Moms like my mugs because they help kids not fool around at the table. And adults who like sports like them too.  My product reviews have been really great!  My mugs are good for people who can’t go outside and play basketball.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>A Kaufman Foundation poll found more than half of millennials want to start a business, but that the key barriers are a lack of access to capital and a lack of knowledge. Jack's Stands' goal is to help young entrepreneurs surmount those barriers.</p>
<p>From<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> 2015 to 2016, Jack's Stands &amp; Marketplaces has hosted over 200 and over 500 kids respectively, with over 60% of them operating Jack's Stands &amp; Marketplaces over multiple dates. In 2016, Jack's Stands &amp; Marketplaces expanded from a single farmers market location in 2014 to 7 locations, including 3 malls in 2016.  In 2017, Jack plans to expand to many more locations and events within Colorado and expand to at least 2 locations outside of Colorado.  In 2017, Jack's Stands &amp; Marketplaces will host over a thousand kids and sell the great products of dozens of young entrepreneurs; while sharing their inspirational stories.  The impact that this will have on participating kids--with your support--is immeasurable.  </span></p>
<h3>Risk &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are expanding outside of Colorado for the first time and their is a risk that this becomes a significant challenge.  We have been addressing this potential challenge by growing slowly in Colorado, working with sponsoring families and entities to create a model that we will be able to duplicate outside of Colorado. </p>
<h3>Can't Help Right Now?</h3>

<p>If you're unable to contribute, you can still be part of the mission to have kids and their families experience entrepreneurship, learn about business, build confidence, make some money, and have fun!  All you have to do is help spread the word by using the Indiegogo share tools below and letting everyone you know hear about Jack's Stands &amp; Marketplaces!   </p>

This specific background, synergy and tight cooperation with partners helped us to develop unique features of our Technology Nation project: Number oneWe use online courses of leading world universities.Meaning our students get certified and globally recognized knowledge in computer programming upon completing the full four months course free of charge. Number twoWe use an innovative method of education: blended learning (a combination of online and offline education) According to Coursera statistics, a maximum of 7% of students completes a full online course.  According to our experience, when it comes to programming things are even harder (up to 5%) pass the final exam.That’s why in Technology Nation project we came to a decision to enroll mentors - experienced programmers to hold practical evening classes for groups of 20 people during four months.  For the first wave of education, the mentors even agreed to lead groups free of charge, while now we offer them a symbolic fee for their important work.Using this approach, in less than a year we are proud to reach a 42% completion rate of our free courses. Number threeWe transform outdated libraries across Ukraine into modernized learning hubs with computers, projectors and Internet access available to everyone.To launch a new learning hub, we first collect computers and other needed equipment (mostly via donations from IT companies that function in Ukraine) and then place them in libraries. Number fourOur target audience is adults, mainly those who lost their jobs, not because of their personal mishandling but due to regretful force majeure factors in Ukraine for the last years (military conflict, the annexation of Crimea, resulting in stagnation of the range of industries: tourism, legal, financial and many others). Thus, we give a chance to those passionate, motivated and talented people to get new jobs using the knowledge and skills our courses offer them.  First resultsThese core features, a dedicated teamwork, and support from partners helped us to reach remarkable results in less than a year of a project running:
We launched 80 groups (up to 20 people each)
Hired 67 mentors - experienced developers
Donated 600 computers and other equipment to 40 local libraries

Enrolled 1250 people to the courses 
Graduates with graduation certificates, Zaporizhia city, Ukraine  What your funds will be used for?If we collect the full pledged amount of 50,000 USD:
We educate 1000 new IT specialists in only 8 months across Ukraine
We launch and equip at least 20 new learning hubs

We give a real chance for talented people to find new demanded jobs in IT
The more funds we collect, the more people in Ukraine get a chance for sustainable future.  And the last but not leastWorld needs IT - Ukraine has the resourcesBy 2020 the world will lack 5,000,000 IT specialists, Europe 900,000, Ukraine 100,000.Even if you are geographically far from us, you can help by donating funds to the Technology Nation project, a project that will:
help talented people in Ukraine find jobs in IT
lead Ukraine into more stability via enhanced IT sector
grant world new talented software developers for all the industries

Health and Well-being
Our platform isn't just about developing football talent. We understand that access to coaching training and delivering health and well-being techniques, using football as a vehicle, is powerful. It can change lives. Here are some statistics from the WHO that motivates us:

Insufficient physical activity is a key risk factor for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer and diabetes.
Physical activity has significant health benefits and contributes to prevent NCDs.
More than 80% of the world's adolescent population is insufficiently physically active.

Further advice form the WHO includes:

Children and adolescents aged 5-17years should do at least 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity daily.
Physical activity of amounts greater than 60 minutes daily will provide additional health benefits. 
Adults aged 18+ should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity throughout the week, or do at least 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity throughout the week, or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity.

Scorcher aims to help combat these issues by offering an easy and enjoyable way to get fit and healthy and to monitor progress. We want to help the world play football to a higher standard and get fitter doing so!

We need your help to promote Season One, and create Season Two!

 2. We want to reach out to build listenership and grow our community. Our target markets are colleges and universities with programs in entrepreneurship; co-working spaces; conferences featuring start-ups and investors; and business owners who are constantly learning and looking for next big ideas.  We need funding to design and deliver pitch materials to these markets and get them to hear our programs.

In the past we were able to use donated cameras and find computer labs to make our projects work, but the reality is, we need reliable equipment to make the programs results consistent. Once we have the necessary equipment, it will be available for future class projects, and be used by deserving students. There is also other expenses that are not easily funded through the grant writing that we are currently doing, and most of the awards we have applied for will not be distributed until next school year.</p>

<h3><b>Our Goal</b></h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><p><span>Equipment - 8 tablets with 5 mp or better cameras - $1600</span></p></li>
<li><p><span>Material costs for student art exhibit and venue - $675</span></p></li>
<li><p><span>Transportation for student photography field trips - $200</span></p></li>
<li><p><span>Total funding goal - $2475</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p><span>If we exceed our goal, we will put this money toward the next upcoming project in the fall of 2015. We have many big ideas for this program, and more funding will allow us to pursue the next steps of the process without spending more of our time and focus to fund-raise and write grant proposals.</span></p>
<p><span>If we don't meet our goal we will continue our fundraising efforts through other means, and If necessary, we can forego some of our equipment purchases or buy lower-end models. We are dedicated to making this project happen, and will do so if even remotely possible. Even after the indiegogo campaign ends, we will happily accept donations through our fiscal sponsor, <a href=""https://www.fracturedatlas.org/site/fiscal/profile?id=4086"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fractured Atlas</a>.</span></p>

   What We Need & What You Get  Our World Focus is a young organization, and is therefore building it's framework. In the past we were able to use donated cameras and find computer labs to make our projects work, but the reality is, we need reliable equipment to make the programs results consistent. Once we have the necessary equipment, it will be available for future class projects, and be used by deserving students. There is also other expenses that are not easily funded through the grant writing that we are currently doing, and most of the awards we have applied for will not be distributed until next school year.
You can get some great perks for donating to our cause, plus you'll get the satisfaction of knowing that your helping to inspire our students to become responsible and compassionate global citizens!



Our Goal


Equipment - 8 tablets with 5 mp or better cameras - $1600
Material costs for student art exhibit and venue - $675
Transportation for student photography field trips - $200
Total funding goal - $2475

If we exceed our goal, we will put this money toward the next upcoming project in the fall of 2015. We have many big ideas for this program, and more funding will allow us to pursue the next steps of the process without spending more of our time and focus to fund-raise and write grant proposals.
If we don't meet our goal we will continue our fundraising efforts through other means, and If necessary, we can forego some of our equipment purchases or buy lower-end models. We are dedicated to making this project happen, and will do so if even remotely possible. Even after the indiegogo campaign ends, we will happily accept donations through our fiscal sponsor, Fractured Atlas.

</div></div>","Short Summary 
I'm sure you are aware of the important role that Citizens Against Unfair Financial Practices plays in helping people whose lives are impacted by financial hardship. This important work is supported largely by the support of generous donors who contribute to our annual capital campaign. This year's goal is $10,000.00, which will allow Citizens Against Unfair Financial Practices to continue providing much needed services to those in our community who are in need of assistance. Without the continued support of generous donors like you, these needs will likely go unmet.98.5 New Mix FM will be Memphis, TN. First noncommercial Bi-lingual radio station that will discuss the basics of finance. We will broadcast English and Spanish music by local, independent, and legendary artists. We'll spread the good word about what local entrepreneurs, non-profits, and social groups are doing to enhance our community. We will showcase powerful content like Whats Up Memphis! We will unite Memphis's diverse community of voices with original and creative programming. 
What We Need & What You Get
In order to continue making a difference in the lives of individuals affected by the work of Citizens Against Unfair Financial Practices, it is vital for this year's capital campaign to be a success. Can we count on you to make a donation to this important cause? By making a tax deductible donation to our capital campaign, you'll be directly contributing to promote awareness to people struggling with financial hardship. Additionally, you'll be recognized for your generosity as a capital campaign supporter on the Citizens Against Unfair Financial Practices website and in the upcoming newsletter.
The Impact 
Our broadcast will cover the experiences of our local community. We strongly believe that our community can make wise decisions when informed and by streaming this effort, we can broaden our reach for others to see.
Risks & Challenges

It’s the nature of the beast. Uncensored, 100 percent democratic media is a social service. It can only exist through listener support or grant funding, or it’s content will be compromised by the special interests of advertisers and big business. We ask for your assistance in supporting a cause that reflects our local community without commercial influences.

We started this project as a bid to revive the SEA scene in terms of competitive gameplay and creating a community. Our hopes for it is to be able to showcase the talent in SEA, which we believe are able to compete with the best in the world.

noosh
noun \ ˈnüs\
: enjoyment of the soul [Persian]
: : a community where foodies from all backgrounds share their love of eating, culture, and tradition

Throughout the world, throughout the centuries, people connect through food.  A meal before a diplomatic summit breaks the ice.  A family convenes at the end of the day.  A special feast commemorates a holiday.  Friendships develop over food. Travelers experience another culture through the hospitality of a host.  Our enjoyment of food is universal.  Our connection to food is powerful…symbolic…essential…an expression of a culture…an expression of love.  In the 
NooshTube™  community, we believe that this connection is greater than differences, more powerful and longer-lasting than conflicts.  NooshTube is the starting place for Yummy Diplomacy™.

Why We Need Your Help And Why We Are A Viable Donor Opportunity?







Food is our common ground, a universal experience ~James Beard 
We are asking for your support to build the first Beta version of the NooshTube interactive platform to  enable users to build a culinary community for cultural exchanges through sharing of heritage, traditions, recipes, and related stories.  Our goal on Indiegogo is to raise $30,000 that will allow us to build a customized beta version of the user-interface, a server infrastructure, and develop our branding design.  
The sales of ethnic ingredients continue to grow by double digits, in volume and value annually. These trends highlight the importance of population changes and increased multiculturalism. To make the picture better, the perceived healthfulness of the staple ingredients makes the conscious consumer a perfect target.
The  direct market includes almost four million
individuals within the US spanning multi-generations and ethnic diasporas.  The initial projected annual gross revenue, including NooshTube's six initial income streams, is $ 20 million dollars.
In 2008, 22% of Americans consumed Mediterranean food and 15% Middle Eastern, while above 70% consumed Chinese, Mexican or Italian.  In 2013, Chinese and Italian restaurants went out of business at a higher rate than other ethnic food showing a potential over-saturated market space.  Therefore, the potential growth opportunities within the Greater Middle Eastern and Eastern Mediterranean food market space is immense.

<h2><b>Short Summary</b></h2>
<p>15 March 2011 is a date that many
people won’t forget. It marked the beginning of the conflict that is still
ravaging Syria.  It’s been 3 years, 10
months and 1 day since more than 3.2 million refugees fled their homes into
neighboring countries. </p>
<p>More than 1.5 million registered
refugees are currently in Lebanon. Many of them live in tents in camps that
hardly contain anything. Many of them are children. Many of them have lost
their relatives, their homes, their belongings and their livelihoods. Many of
them fled to Lebanon because they had no other place to go. </p>
<p>Last week’s storm covered with
snow thousands of kilometers in Lebanon, leaving many people cold, traumatized,
scared, and vulnerable. </p>
<p>Many of us no matter where we are
know how it feels to have cold feet, don’t we? Many of us know how it feels not
to sense our fingers, hands, and feet? So do you imagine how it would feel to
be constantly cold, day and night, in front of this cold freezing weather? </p>
<p>We are a group of volunteers from different backgrounds who believe can make a difference. We would like to collect donations to buy blankets for the needy. We believe and we know that we can! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul> <li>We would like to collect 5000$ to buy blankets for the needy. We will collect the money, buy blankets, and give them to NGOs in Beirut and Tripoli for distribution. </li>
<li>If we reach our goal within 7 days (i.e. by the end of this campaign), we will buy blankets for the needy. If we don't reach our goal, we will buy blankets for the amount collected. In other words, no matter what, we are buying blankets for the needy. </li>
<li>We found two types of blankets: Option 1: big size (210 x 160 cm) for 5.75$ each, and option 2: small size (125 x 160 cm) for 3.45$ each. </li>
<li>If you donate 200$, you get an A4 wall calendar by Zeina Gabriel (who is  a passionate photographer).</li>
<li>If you donate 50$, you get an A3 photo by Zeina Gabriel with a quote on giving and receiving.</li>
<li>If you donate 25$, you get two postcards by Zeina Gabriel from Lebanon with quotes on giving and receiving. </li> </ul>
<h3>What We Already Did</h3>
<div>On Thursday January 8, 2015, during the worst storm this year, we had the idea of collecting money to buy blankets. We posted a brief Facebook status asking for help. By the next day, on Friday January 9, 2015, we had collected enough to buy 150 blankets. We bought 150 blankets (112 small and 38 big) that same day and the next day on Saturday January 10, 2015, we gave them to the NGO ""<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Leb4Refugees"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lebanese for Refugees</a>"" who distributed them to the needy in the Bekaa and Tripoli. By Monday January 12, 2015, we had collected enough to buy 350 blankets. We bought these 350 blankets (175 big and 175 small) on Tuesday morning and we also gave them to the NGO ""Lebanese for Refugees"" who distributed them.  So far, we bought 500 blankets and helped 500 persons feel a bit warmer. We would like to extend our initiative to be able to collect additional money to buy more and more blankets. </div>

<p>Hi I'm Moshin Juma and I helped to found the <b>People
Concern Children's Project  (PCCP) </b>in 2006 in Kampala, Uganda. We
have worked to instill fundamental life skills into disadvantaged Ugandan
children and empower them to create a better future for themselves. PCCP, as a
local Ugandan charity, aims to cultivate this through basic
education, ""green"" education, computer skills, public speaking,
craft-making, and fostering an environment to promote learning. By
""green"" education we mean at a basic level we work to help children
understand how to take care of the environment in which they live. We are currently
located in Kampala District in Makindye Division within Kabalagala Parish in a
resource challenged <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/@0.3012914,32.5979982,17z%20Kampala"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">neighborhood near Kikubamutwe</a>. As residents of the neighborhood, we feel
that it is critical that the children and youth understand how to take positive
steps toward making their current environment clean, safe and productive. <br/>
</p>
<p><b><span>Our vision.</span></b></p>
<p>One
day every child will have the basic tools to create a better future for
themselves. Now, we feel to accomplish our objectives we need to build a school
where children and youth can have a creative, and experimental learning
experience. Our vision for the school is to provide the children skills while
promoting environmental and social responsibility. To fully accomplish our
vision we would like to initiate the <b>New School Building Project</b>.
This project will help us build a model school that will allow the children and
youth to grow the food that they eat, to find ways to reuse the waste that
vulnerable communities generate, and test other ideas for creating sustainable,
modern solutions to our pressing issues. </p>
<p>This
project will be a dynamic, exploration into finding educational solutions for
today - solutions that include children and youth as key participants in the
solution design. We see the school as an ecosystem and feel that designing the
school will be an evolving project. We will seek ways to reduce our footprint
on the earth, teach children and youth to be good stewards of the Earth, and
through experiential learning introduce them to principles to help them design
better green solutions for their future. As part of the project we will create
a ""Farm to Table"" experience in which the children and youth grow
some of their own food. Also, we will promote a culture in which the pupils go
beyond gardening and composting, and create an enabling environment in which
the pupils can find ways to rethink how we deal with the waste that we generate
as a school and community. </p>
<p>PCCP
is a registered NGO operating in Uganda. All of the current children and youth
that we serve have financial disadvantages and are not enrolled in traditional
schooling. The very reason PCCP was formed was to address the existing lack of
schooling in the community. In 2006 we started with 26 children, by the end of
2006 we had 32, then when we started in 2007 we had grown to 50 students. By
the end of 2007 the number had grown to 100. In 2009 there were 105 students.
In 2010 we had 130 students and this grow to 185 students.  And now we have 201 students in the entire
program. </p>
<p>One
of our primary partners is Aktion Canchanabury (<a href=""http://www.canchanabury.de/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.canchanabury.de/</a>). Aktion
Canchanabury is a German development organization that works to support projects that “empower the target
groups in terms of ‘helping people help themselves’ to go their own way.”</p>
<p>At
the beginning of 2014 Aktion supported some youth from the community to a
gardening course at the Community Integrated Development Initiatives (<a href=""http://cidiuganda.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://cidiuganda.org/</a>). Later in the year
Aktion supported youth at PCCP with equipment for soccer academy. It was
through these initiatives that our partnership has grown. We now have signed a
Memorandum of Understanding with Aktion Canchanabury.</p>
<p><b>Our Roadmap</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437923831/z1rlfxvywvdlj0jv3dij.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We
recently received 16,000 Euro from our partners Aktion Canchanabury. This
amount has allowed us to buy land outside of Kampala in <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mpigi,+Uganda/@0.2269787,32.3281288,14z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x177d750f28c294df:0x8f8fd279a8b29d41"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Mpigi, approximately 45 km</a> away. In this very initial phase we will build a groundkeeper’s house and
toilet facilities for the build out process. In February 2016 we expect an
additional 10,000 Euro which will allow us to build an administration block and
one class block (6 rooms) for pupils in Nursery school and grades Primary 1-3.
We expect to receive our first intake of pupils in September 2016. We then
expect a final 8000 Euro from Aktion Canchanabury in early 2017. This funding
will allow us to complete additional blocks. And yet, there is much more that we
need to be able to accomplish our goals of creating a self-sustaining school.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>Here we will explain more about our needs at
PCCP for the <b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>New School Building Project</b> </b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">and
what you will get by contributing to the program:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>We are
     requesting $40,000 to finish building and equipping a proper school for
     the children and youth that we serve</li>
<li>Specifically the
     funding will cover the costs of finishing construction on the school,
     building a football (soccer) field. The funds will also help us buy school
     books, furniture, science equipment, trees/seedlings, and a construct a
     library and a small computer lab for the children. See breakdown:</li>
<ul>
<li>Furniture $6300</li>
<li>Football/soccer
      field - $10,000</li>
<li>Football/soccer
      equipment - $1000</li>
<li>Computer lab block

</ul>
<li>Additionally, we
     will purchase a video camera and computer for creating a short documentary
     about the project. See cost above</li>
<li>Additionally, we
     hope to buy a small vehicle to transport staff between the Kampala site
     and the Mpigi site. See cost above.</li>
<li>PCCP will
     maintain a separate accounting of all funding raised via Indiegogo and
     maintain records of each expenditure that can be shared with those who
     donate.</li>
<li>As a perk for
     being part of the project you can receive a video documentary of the whole
     project and have your name engraved on a plaque that will be mounted at
     the school.</li>
<li>If we don't
     reach our entire goal, we will still buy supplies and build a portion of
     the school that we can and continue to seek funds for completion. We are
     passionate that we will see the school built.</li>

<h3>Why Create the THINQubator?</h3>

What We Need  

What You Get







Why Create the THINQubator?

The THINQubator grew out of a need.  We've been running a successful and growing adult makerspace since 2012 called the Tech Valley Center of Gravity in Troy, NY.  Members, and community members started bringing their kids into the space  Educators were calling regularly to see if we could host field trips and Professional Development.  Parents wanted summer camps.  The requests kept coming.  We did our best to accommodate them but the current space just did not meet the unique needs of kids.  

The Plan

The Center of Gravity has outgrown its building in just two short years and has received a state grant to move to a building 10x bigger just a block away.  We're nearing the end of a year long construction project. With the move on the horizon, the time was ripe to carve out some kids-only space; the THINQubator was born.  The THINQubator will occupy nearly 1000 sqft of prime space on the 1st floor of the beautiful, Victorian, four-story Quackenbush Building right in the heart of downtown Troy, NY.

The Impact

Imagine what you could have created if a place like the THINQubator was around when you were a kid?  Or when you were raising your kids?  Imagine what's possible for kids who have access to this space.  This generation will create a world that we can't possibly imagine.  Let's give them the cutting-edge tools to dream BIGGER!  We live in an area rich with academics, high-tech industry, and a teeming creative  community.  Kids at the THINQubator will have access to professors, researchers, artists, designers, architects, engineers, coders, applied mathematicians, and scientists.  We'll help kids find their passions.  We'll provide them with the resources to develop their skills and realize their dreams!

I would define myself as a shameless idealist who is caring and passionate and always looking for new opportunities to make a positive impact in my local, national and international communities.</p>
<p>Recently I received the incredible opportunity to apply and be selected out of hundreds of applicants to be one of 17 members of Junior Team Canada with Global Vision, a youth-led delegation who travel around the world on trade missions to represent and promote Canadian industry. While on my 8-day trade mission, I will be connecting Canadian businesses and organizations with those in Peru, through gaining contacts, industry knowledge and cultural relativism. While there, I hope to focus especially on the green energy sector because it is so so important to reduce our populations global ecological footprint, and the green/renewable energy sector is currently booming in Peru, providing exciting opportunities for growth in the Canadian industry.</p>
<p>This is an incredible opportunity for me to not only represent Canada on an international level, but also to gain valuable experience that will help to shape me into a future, global leader. However in order to participate, I must raise $3,500 in partnerships with local businesses, organizations, and individuals who are passionate about giving youth unique opportunities to make a difference on an international level. People who are hopefully, just like you!</p>

The funds raised go towards costs of the trip such as accommodations, flights, meals, and other means of transportation in order to fulfill the mandates given to us.</p>
<p>Personally, I am a very youthful and energetic young adult with an insatiable curiosity and desire to learn and experience new languages, cultures, and ways of life.

It is for this reason that I am proposing every person who donates $100 or more can give me a funny, appropriate task or a cool activity to complete during my 8-day trip to Peru. The activities could be as wide-ranging as eating a traditional and weird Peruvian meal, or hugging a stranger, or kiss a llama. Then I will take a picture of me doing the activity and post it on a blog that I will create. In this manner we can work together to create a positive difference in Peru and help me make the most out of my trade mission to Peru!</p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>To be very honest, my biggest challenge with this incredible opportunity is the relatively short time period that I have to fundraise the amount of money that I need to in order to make the impact that I want to while in Peru. </p>
<p>The other big risk that I am taking is this new concept of having people that I have never met give me a task over the internet that will likely, and hopefully take me out of my comfort zone. It will be a new and exciting challenge that I am prepared to tackle head on.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>While I understand that not everyone can help out by contributing funds to my campaign, definitely spread the word about my mission to make a positive impact in the world by using the Indiegogo share tools!

Thus with the partnerships I will create with businesses and with individuals, I will be able to maximize the impact that I will have by promoting the green/renewable energy sector, and by spreading smiles, good cheer, and laughter  around the world!
    Risks & Challenges To be very honest, my biggest challenge with this incredible opportunity is the relatively short time period that I have to fundraise the amount of money that I need to in order to make the impact that I want to while in Peru. 
The other big risk that I am taking is this new concept of having people that I have never met give me a task over the internet that will likely, and hopefully take me out of my comfort zone. It will be a new and exciting challenge that I am prepared to tackle head on.
    Other Ways You Can Help While I understand that not everyone can help out by contributing funds to my campaign, definitely spread the word about my mission to make a positive impact in the world by using the Indiegogo share tools! And if you have a great idea of a cool little task that I can complete while in Peru, inspire other contributors by suggesting ideas of  potential tasks!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

needs of families in our small, rural West Virginia community for high quality
pre-school education/development and after-school care in a Christian
environment. The Academy is a ministry outgrowth of the Old Greenbrier Baptist Church and her vision to reach out to meet real needs of families in our community.<br/></p>
<p>The Alderson area community lacks adequate Pre-K (3 &amp; 4 year old) educational opportunities and group after-school services for children in Pre-K to fifth grade. There is no Christian Pre-K program available in our area. Also, many of our public elementary school children are latch-key kids with no where to go between the end of school and the return of mom and dad from work. Our non-profit program centers on providing both education and care for our children in a Christian environment. We believe this ministry is critical to the future success of our children, our families, our community, and our world.</p>
<p>By contributing to our campaign you will not only help enable us to care for children and families today but also enable our children to be more productive, moral citizens who in-turn contribute to making a better future for our community and world.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are committed to re-purposing our existing church facilities (e.g., a vacant parsonage) to provide necessary educational opportunities and services for our children. Unfortunately, our church alone does not have the financial resources necessary to fund the changes and updates to make the Emma Alderson Christian Academy a reality. <br/></p>
<p>We need $25,000 in order to fund the items identified in our business plan to launch our Academy by August 2015. However, we have already raised $5,000. So, our Indiegogo campaign goal is $20,000. A more detailed funding plan listing specific items/costs in each category below is available upon request.<br/></p> <ul> <li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>We will use all funds received to meet the needs of launching our Academy. We are not passively waiting for contributions to come in but also are actively working to gather these funds. Recently we held a Valentine's Dinner and Auction which netted $2,686.38. We are planning other fund-raising events for the near future. Also, we are receiving donations not only from church members but also from other churches and private individuals both in our community and from other areas. Many people are concerned about providing this ministry to our children and families.<br/></p>
<p>As a perk, your contributions to this program are fully tax-deductible since the church of whom we are a ministry is an IRS recognized 501(c)(3) religious organization. We will gladly provide the documentation required by the IRS acknowledging your generous contributions. See the Perks section for details.<br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The ministry delivered to our children and families by the Emma Alderson Christian Academy is valuable. The need for high quality developmental and educational opportunities in rural Appalachian communities such as ours is critical. If you and I are not willing to reach out to meet these needs as believers, then who will do so? <br/></p>
<p>The lives of our children and families matter. If we can enable a child to learn and grow into an educated, moral individual, then we have certainly bettered not only our community but our world. If we can enable a family to have more time together in the evening since homework has been done in our After-school program, then we have bettered the quality of our families' lives and have helped them draw closer together. If we can enable parents to complete their work-day without having to take their child to an after-school program in another community or to worry about what their child is doing until they get home, then we have both removed stress from them and improved the quality of their work and lives in general.<br/></p>We truly believe in the ministry of Emma Alderson Christian Academy, and we pray that you will too. We have an on-going commitment to meet the needs of families and children in our area through Christian programming. We reach out to families and children in our community on a regular basis with Sunday school programs and seasonal programs (e.g., Easter activities, Vacation Bible School, Christmas plays). We believe that launching our Academy will enable us to make deeper and more significant positive impacts on the lives or our families and children well into the future.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Any new effort is not without risks and obstacles. We certainly face many of these and are working hard to overcome them.<br/></p>
<p>Our program's cost to families (i.e., tuition and fees) must be kept low due to the economic challenges faced by families living in our area. At the same time we want to deliver high quality programming which is very costly. As a non-profit we commit to keep costs low by running our programs on a break-even basis. However, even though we are a non-profit, we must have sufficient cash-flow from donations and tuition in order to fund high quality, safe education/development opportunities for our children. We are working diligently to keep both our start-up and operating costs low, to find and utilize used equipment and supplies, to receive in-kind donations of goods and services when available, and to raise as much money as we can from local donors, However, we know that we will need many contributors, such as you, in order to enable this ministry at the high-quality level that we envision.<br/></p>
<p>We determined early in our discussions not to receive any governmental funding, which is both available and significant, so that our programs may include Christian teaching and practices (e.g., prayer, Bible readings) without limitations. We stand on this principle and trust God to send us the resources we need to enable our work for his glory.</p>
<p>We believe the needs our Academy addresses in our community truly exist based on our community surveys and discussions with both public and private educators and consultants familiar with our area. However, there is always the possibility that sign-ups for the Academy may not achieve levels significant enough to enable the start of either or both of our programs (i.e., Pre-K, After-school) as planned in August 2015. We are fully committed to begin with the needs that self-identify in our community based on sign-ups. If we have applications sufficient to start either the Pre-K Program or the After-school Program, then we will start where the need identifies itself. In any event, we will work diligently to continue meeting the needs of our families and children through either the launch of our Academy at a later date or through other programs that we identify as we continue to reach-out to our community. Our efforts will never be wasted as we seek to meet the needs of our families and children and to glorify God in all that we do.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>You may be unable to contribute financially, but that doesn't mean that you can't help. Please consider supporting our efforts in these ways:</p> <ul> <li>Pray for our children, families, community, and Academy. Ask God to bless and open the way for this vital ministry in our community.<br/>

<h3><b>CAMPAIGN GOALS</b></h3>
<p>Our main goal is to raise $1,000,000.00 - We are breaking the campaign up into a few smaller goals to be more realistic.</p>
<p><b>Goal 1: $500.00</b></p>
<p>The first $500.00 raised will be used to cover our teams entry fee into the <a href=""learning.xprize.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://learning.xprize.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">XPRIZE</a>.  </p>
<p><b>Goal 2: $5 000.00</b></p>
<p>The next $5000.00 will go toward R&amp;D.</p>
<p><b>Goal 3: $ 10 000.00</b></p>
<p>If we raise an additional $10 000.00 we will be able to fund development by our core team for 3 months. </p>
<p><b>Goal 4: $50 000.00</b></p>
<p>If we raise an additional $50 000.00 this will go toward development of the basic framework.</p>
<p><b>Goal 5: $500 000.00</b></p>
<p>This will be used to cover expenses for a small team working full time on our project for a period of 18 months.</p>
<p><b>Goal 6: $1 000 000.00</b></p>
<p>Reaching this goal will make it possible for us to expand the team considerably and help to deliver a much better app. </p>
<p>If we raise more than $1million we will use these funds to keep improving the app.  </p>

</div></div>","WHAT?

A free, open source, mobile learning app that aids in teaching preschool children how to read, write and do basic math without needing a teacher. 

WHY?


Because 250 million children are unable to read, write or do math.
Because 5.2 million teachers are needed to teach these children. - UNESCOWe are hoping to change the status quo, but we need your help.


HOW?
By standing together to fund and develop a free, scalable, open source, mobile application that could aid in helping these children to teach themselves, basic reading, writing and arithmetic. If we reach our main goal, this mobile app can be made available to the children who need it, at no cost.


THE TEAM?
My name is Simon Botes, I am the founder of AppCRAFT. 

AppCRAFT is a small African startup based in Plettenberg Bay, South Africa. We have been developing award winning educational mobile applications since 2009.  With your help we are now hoping to tackle our largest project ever. 
INVITATION:
This is your personal invitation to join hands with us. Lets make a difference in the lives of 250 million children by teaming up and developing the world's first, community powered, non commercial, advert free, open source Mobile Education Framework.  
WHY AppCRAFT?
The educational apps and ideas that my team and I have come up with in this field have already received honorable mentions by both UNESCO and the Pearson Foundation. We have also won multiple local and international awards for our other educational apps. 



To-date more than 450,000 people from 200 countries have benefited from some of our other free educational mobile apps, including our recent Breast Cancer Awareness App.   
COST?  
Our goal is to develop the first fully working beta version of our mobile learning app within 18 months for less than $1 000 000.00 

HOW CAN YOU HELP?
We are hoping that the online community will stand together and support this project by each giving $1.00 or more to support our project.
SOCIAL EXPERIMENT 
To make things interesting let's try a little social experiment and see if we can use the Six degrees of separation concept to fund development of this project. 
Once you have contributed $1.00, nominate a friend or seven to do the same.If you want to nominate 2 friends give $2.00 and so forth.
If you have many friends, select the perk package that fits your needs.  



Step 1: Give just $1.00 (per nominated friend) to this indiegogo campaign.

Step 2: Take an ""Uncle Sam wants you"" Selfie.  (With or without a cool hat.)

Step 3: Nominate 1 or more friends on twitter or Facebook to take part.

Step 4: Tag your selfie & nomination with #ReadWrite2015 #PayItForward


Step 5: If your nominated friends accepts the nomination and takes part,  send them a little gift to say thank you for taking part.

Step 6:  Please Like and share this campaign on your social channels. 

Sample Tweet: I gave $1.00 in support of #ReadWrite2015 and now nominate @FriendsNameGoesHere to take part #PayItForward (Attach your Uncle Sam Selfie and link to this indiegogo page.)






I will start this social experiment by giving $7.00 to this campaign and nominating 7 of my friends to take part. ($1.00 for each nominated friend) 
I am hoping that they will each then also contribute to this campaign and nominate some of their friends to take part and so on and so forth. If you are nominated please keep it going.

CAMPAIGN GOALS
Our main goal is to raise $1,000,000.00 - We are breaking the campaign up into a few smaller goals to be more realistic.
Goal 1: $500.00
The first $500.00 raised will be used to cover our teams entry fee into the XPRIZE.  
Goal 2: $5 000.00
The next $5000.00 will go toward R&D.
Goal 3: $ 10 000.00
If we raise an additional $10 000.00 we will be able to fund development by our core team for 3 months. 
Goal 4: $50 000.00
If we raise an additional $50 000.00 this will go toward development of the basic framework.
Goal 5: $500 000.00
This will be used to cover expenses for a small team working full time on our project for a period of 18 months.
Goal 6: $1 000 000.00
Reaching this goal will make it possible for us to expand the team considerably and help to deliver a much better app. 
If we raise more than $1million we will use these funds to keep improving the app.  
 
Thank you for taking the time to read and take part in #ReadWrite2015

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Karen Nisenson has been a global leader in special needs for the past 30 years.As a Creative Arts Therapist using music and art as vehicles of expression,she saw the impact that music had on each individual, no matter the behavioral or emotional issues present. The elements of music, rhythm, harmony and melody provided paths to non-verbal conversations that communicated feelings and ideas, and stimulated speech in those that had no verbal ability.

However, traditional music learning programs have long been inaccessible to many children with special needs. And that’s where we want to help. Founder and Clinical Director of Arts for Healing, Karen Nisenson, and Australian Music Educator and Founder of Simply Music, Neil Moore, have created a unique, adaptive piano program that transforms the issues that prevent a child with special needs from learning in a conventional way. The Simply Music Gateway program will be an online streaming program designed specifically for any child with special needs who thinks differently and needs to learn in a different style. Simply create an online account and access the customized training, support and guidance materials that have been designed specifically for occupational therapists, music therapists or music educators, as well as parents/guardians or care-providers. No extensive background or training is necessary, anyone can teach this program!
EMPOWER CHILDREN with special needs and their families through music.
PROVIDE SCHOOLS & ORGANIZATIONS with special needs programs.
Impact the special needs community on a GLOBAL SCALE.
Provide our program completely FREE OF CHARGE.

Jewels Harrison was diagnosed with Autism at the age of 3. He had major difficulties with speech and language and the inability to use his hands and fingers. Look at him now!Using the Simply Music Gateway program, Jewels’ learned how to play piano in small steps that are easy, fun, and playing-based, rather than reading-based. By focusing on his learning differences one sensory system at a time, his motor skills improved vastly. Now at age 13, his fine motor skills have improved vastly, and he plays blues, classical, and popular pieces with ease! Simply Music Gateway has given him a new means of self-expression through music. 




The impact on students and their families is profound. Children with special needs, through acquiring musical self-expression, have a new means communicating and revealing their individual personalities and talents. The Simply Music Gateway programs offers a new opportunity for socialization and further inclusion in their school and greater community.












The core curriculum for the Simply Music Gateway program is under development and we are eager to begin production on this breakthrough program. Through this Indiegogo campaign we're aiming to raise enough funds to make the program reality.






• Producing the program student materials – Streaming video.

• Producing the specific instruction guides – Printable PDFs for parents/care providers, music educators and music/occupational therapists.

• Building the online delivery system for global distribution of the program.
• Testing and polishing the final program and making it ready for the public.


The program will be delivered via an online system. The only requirement you need to get access to the program will be a web browser and an internet connection!









































Karen Nisenson is Founder and Clinical Director of Arts for Healing. She holds a Bachelor and Master of Music degree in Piano Performance from the Juilliard School, Bachelor of Science from Hunter College, a Master of Arts degree in Music Therapy from NYU, where she has been an adjunct professor and affiliated with the Nordoff-Robbins Center for Music Therapy since 1978. Karen developed the integrated music and art therapy methodology (IMAT) and the Adaptive Music Teaching Curriculum. She has also created early childhood academic programs specifically designed for children on the Autism Spectrum. Karen is a contributor to Special Parent Magazine and The Motor Story Online News Magazine. Karen consults to schools, and frequently presents talks and workshops to parents and professionals about the impact and importance of the arts in education.


Karen Nisenson has been a global leader in special needs for the past 30 years.As a Creative Arts Therapist using music and art as vehicles of expression,she saw the impact that music had on each individual, no matter the behavioral or emotional issues present. The elements of music, rhythm, harmony and melody provided paths to non-verbal conversations that communicated feelings and ideas, and stimulated speech in those that had no verbal ability. The power of interactive improvisation allowed anyone to make music, and so began her “playing-based” adaptive teaching method.

We think a <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">social stigma has been created in the past decade that being accepted into a certain group of schools means you are a better student, are smarter, and that these schools are a perfect fit for everyone.

<p>Osanidde is an African word (in the Ugandan language) which is used in many Ugandan worship songs. It means ""You are Worthy!"" and it sounds just like ""Oh Sunny Day!""  This word sums up our heart and vision for this unique Ugandan Orphanage.</p>
<p>Osanidde village is home to 160 energetic children who love Jesus with all of their hearts. This is a happy place, despite what it lacks.</p>
<p>These children were brought to Osanidde from the surrounding villages and islands of Lake Victoria. Unfortunately, little is known about these children prior to their being rescued. Often the chiefs of the village have little or no information about their background. It is not uncommon for both parents to have died due to the AIDS virus.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>
<p><b>But what they lack are the fundamental things that we take for granted, and this is where we come in.</b></p>

<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Sponsoring Purchase of School Equipment</b><br/>
</div>
<p>The majority of the children and teenagers at the orphanage began their school year this past February lacking basic school equipment. In order to create a better learning environment and receive a better education, they need notebooks, pencils, pens, erasers, rulers, calculators and other school supplies. </p>
<p><b>Buying Slippers &amp; Clothes </b></p>
<p>Some of these incredible kids walk around barefoot, most of them don't own a pair of shoes at all, and they wear the same worn-out, dirty shirt day in and day out. Because of the tropical weather it can get pretty cold, and the kids don't have warm clothes or jackets to protect them from the rain.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What If We Surpass Our Goal?</h3>
<p>If we surpass our goal, <b>our BIG Dream is buy them a tractor. </b>They could use a tractor to facilitate food production on a larger scale. They have the land and the more food they grow the less they have to buy. Buying a second hand tractor will cost about $ 18,000 including transportation to the island.</p>
<p>If we significantly surpass our goal, <b>our INNOVATION Goal (Phase II)</b>, we plan on buying 20-30 computers. We believe that today they can start learning to use and work with a computer and tomorrow they can go get their first job or go study a specific trade. We also will need to buy a generator because there is no electricity on the island. In addition we plan on hiring a local computer teacher and sponsor his yearly salary.</p>

<p>My name is Asaf. I'm a 27 year old guy from Tel Aviv, Israel. Recently I embarked on an incredible journey that changed my life. After completing my Bachelor's degree in Engineering, I packed a bag and got on an airplane to Uganda, Africa. </p>
<p>My parents were confused, my friends a little surprised. ""Why Uganda? Why now?"" I could have looked for a job, made some money and gone out with my friends to pubs. The good life, right? But something inside me said: You need to do this.</p>
<p>And I'm so happy I did.</p>
<p>I decided to join the <a href=""http://www.hadassah-med.com/children-site/news-and-research/art-joy-love"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ART-Joy-Love volunteer program</a> for a month (and later extended my stay for a couple more weeks) at a local orphanage called Osanidde on a tiny island located on the beautiful Lake Victoria. When I arrived I was greeted by 160 smiling children. Children who for some reason or another lost their parents, mostly due to AIDS. </p>
<p>These children are blessed. They have people who take care of them, a place to call home and most of all each other. They go to school, play soccer and love to sing. </p>
<br/><p></p>
</div><p></p><h3>What If We Don't Reach Our Goal?</h3>We decided to use flexible funding in this campaign so that people could have the option of paying with credit cards. In case we don't reach our goal (leaving us without enough to buy the tractor), with the help of your donations, big or small, your money will be sent directly to buying school equipment and clothes for these children. <div>
<br/><p>Our goal is for this to become an annual campaign to ensure that every year, all 160 children can start off the school year just like any child should. Just like we did. </p>
<p><b>How do we plan to achieve these goals?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We have set up a verified bank account for this project. All donations will be managed by our Team.</p>

</div></div>","""Education is not a way to escape poverty, it is a way of fighting it.""
- Julius Nyerere, former President of the Republic of Tanzania.


                           


Osanidde is an African word (in the Ugandan language) which is used in many Ugandan worship songs. It means ""You are Worthy!"" and it sounds just like ""Oh Sunny Day!""  This word sums up our heart and vision for this unique Ugandan Orphanage.
Osanidde village is home to 160 energetic children who love Jesus with all of their hearts. This is a happy place, despite what it lacks.
These children were brought to Osanidde from the surrounding villages and islands of Lake Victoria. Unfortunately, little is known about these children prior to their being rescued. Often the chiefs of the village have little or no information about their background. It is not uncommon for both parents to have died due to the AIDS virus. 
But what they lack are the fundamental things that we take for granted, and this is where we come in.






                                   

                                


Sponsoring Purchase of School Equipment

The majority of the children and teenagers at the orphanage began their school year this past February lacking basic school equipment. In order to create a better learning environment and receive a better education, they need notebooks, pencils, pens, erasers, rulers, calculators and other school supplies. 
Buying Slippers & Clothes 
Some of these incredible kids walk around barefoot, most of them don't own a pair of shoes at all, and they wear the same worn-out, dirty shirt day in and day out. Because of the tropical weather it can get pretty cold, and the kids don't have warm clothes or jackets to protect them from the rain.

What If We Surpass Our Goal?
If we surpass our goal, our BIG Dream is buy them a tractor. They could use a tractor to facilitate food production on a larger scale. They have the land and the more food they grow the less they have to buy. Buying a second hand tractor will cost about $ 18,000 including transportation to the island.
If we significantly surpass our goal, our INNOVATION Goal (Phase II), we plan on buying 20-30 computers. We believe that today they can start learning to use and work with a computer and tomorrow they can go get their first job or go study a specific trade. We also will need to buy a generator because there is no electricity on the island. In addition we plan on hiring a local computer teacher and sponsor his yearly salary.



                                            
My name is Asaf. I'm a 27 year old guy from Tel Aviv, Israel. Recently I embarked on an incredible journey that changed my life. After completing my Bachelor's degree in Engineering, I packed a bag and got on an airplane to Uganda, Africa. 
My parents were confused, my friends a little surprised. ""Why Uganda? Why now?"" I could have looked for a job, made some money and gone out with my friends to pubs. The good life, right? But something inside me said: You need to do this.
And I'm so happy I did.
I decided to join the ART-Joy-Love volunteer program for a month (and later extended my stay for a couple more weeks) at a local orphanage called Osanidde on a tiny island located on the beautiful Lake Victoria. When I arrived I was greeted by 160 smiling children. Children who for some reason or another lost their parents, mostly due to AIDS. 
These children are blessed. They have people who take care of them, a place to call home and most of all each other. They go to school, play soccer and love to sing. 

What If We Don't Reach Our Goal?We decided to use flexible funding in this campaign so that people could have the option of paying with credit cards. In case we don't reach our goal (leaving us without enough to buy the tractor), with the help of your donations, big or small, your money will be sent directly to buying school equipment and clothes for these children. 
Our goal is for this to become an annual campaign to ensure that every year, all 160 children can start off the school year just like any child should. Just like we did. 
How do we plan to achieve these goals?

We have set up a verified bank account for this project. All donations will be managed by our Team.



          
                             
We would like to clarify one thing: Any and all donations will go to buy LOCAL equipment and clothes, helping to boost the local African economy. By purchasing locally, we feel we can help two worthy causes at once: the kids and the African economy. Furthermore, for every donation we promise to first thank you. From us, as project leaders, but also a big Thank You from the children themselves. 
For each $10 dollars you give, your name will appear on our wall of sponsors in the website and will be printed and given to the children.






















If you're unable to contribute financially to our cause, you can still help!
Spread the word about these amazing children on social media and to your friends and family via email and help us raise awareness for about our campaign and hopefully bring in more donations. 
You probably know someone who can help, perhaps a friend or a family member, or a relevant company or organization. We ask that you share this campaign on your social networks, tell others around you and make some noise!
Good Tip: On the top left side there are is a 'SHARE' button to send the campaign to your friends.

       You see the girl in the picture above, her name is Hanifah (12 yrs old) and this is one sentence from one of many letters we exchanged. I just had to share it with you and can't describe how beautiful,amazing and humble she is!

      This is a letter from John Katongole (19 yrs old) and he told me he wants study mechanical engineering.

<p></p><p>In
the aftermath of the massive 7.9 earthquake that hit Nepal on the 25<sup>th</sup>
of April 2015, our team of independent professionals and friends came together
with the intention to provide medical aid and sanitation awareness to
earthquake survivors. Our journey began from the outskirts of the Kathmandu
valley and so far we have provided medical aid to over 800 people in five
different locations including Gorkha and Sindhupalchok which are the worst
affected areas.</p>
<p>Following
the initial relief phase we decided to work on mid-term to long- term
reconstruction projects. We began by partnering with the Seven Summits Women -
a team of lady mountaineers from Nepal - to build Temporary Learning Centres in
Bhotenamlang VDC, Sindhupalchok to get children back to a safe learning
environment. This helps in lowering the risk of dropouts and more importantly
in preventing child trafficking, which is a prevalent social crime in the area.
So far we have built Temporary Learning Centres in the villages of Gurungtole,
Bhotegaun and Kafle and a permanent structure in the village of Gobre in
association with Samata Siksha Niketan.</p>
<p>In
order to further ensure that children stay in school and to provide incentive
to parents to send their children to school, we have set a goal of providing approximately
2000 children in 8 schools with nourishing mid-day meals. The following is
an estimate of costs for one year:</p>
<p>Estimated
cost for school feeding program per child per day = 0.15 $<br/>
No. of school days in a month = 25 days<br/>
No. of months the school will be open in a year = 9 months</p>
<p>Cost
for school feeding program per child for 1 year = 33.75 $  </p>
<p><b>Total cost of School feeding program for 2000 children for 1
year = 67,500 $</b></p>

</p><p><b><u>WHAT, WHY &amp; MY
STORY</u></b></p>
<p>The truth is, there are countless actors out in the world, and they are all shooting for a similar dream
with similar goals, in hopes to reach their end result. For me, I’ve pursued acting for the art of the discipline. But more importantly, it's the only thing I want to do with my life. Turning acting into a career is my goal.</p>
<p>Originally, I am from a small town in South Florida where, growing up, I felt stuck in a world that didn’t make me feel creatively motivated or provide opportunity to be imaginative towards your future. With the help of my best friend, I scraped
up all the money I had (which wasn't much) and booked the cheapest one-way flight to NYC. It was sort of a 'no turning
back' move, forcing me to take a
risk. I didn't really know what the end result
would be, but I knew that if
I DIDN'T take that risk, then I would never know at all. </p>
<p>When I landed in New York City, I had a little less than $200 in
my pocket. I was living in hostels for the beginning
until I was taken in by newly made friends and found jobs that allowed me to finally save money and rent a room in an apartment. Once settled, I was able to pursue some small acting gigs. But, I wasn’t doing
much and I didn't
necessarily feel like I was contributing to the actual 'art' of the craft at
all. I realized that if I was going to pursue
something like acting for the rest of my life, I should actually know what I'm
doing – I needed to learn. </p>
<p>I researched a program I connected to at <a href=""http://esperstudio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The William Esper Studio</a> where I could study through a two-year program and <i>really</i> uncover the skills and technique associated with being an
actor. <i>Really</i> find out what it means to dig
deep emotionally, physically
and into past life experiences. And so far, one year into this program, I am absolutely sure of my decision to continue. I am deeply in love with this art of
acting. There's nothing else in the world I would trade it for. </p>
<p><b><u>THE ISSUE</u></b></p>
<p>The toughest part about paying for an accredited acting institution in NYC by oneself is there is very little financial help offered. Unfortunately, I cannot apply for a grant, any loans from the bank,
or even FAFSA, which is typically a HUGE help for students in many cases. At this point, I am independently responsible for paying for my education to become an actor. </p>
<p>My course schedule is rigorous, leaving only nights available for
working a part-time job. On such a small salary
that is also used to pay my rent, for groceries, and necessities, I am in danger of not being able to
participate in the second year of the William Esper program because I simply
can't afford to. I need to pay off my debt from the first year in order to go
through to the second year by July 31<sup>st</sup>, as well as be able to pay for the beginning of my second year, or I will not be able to continue.</p>
<p><b><u>YOUR SUPPORT</u></b></p>
<p>I'm reaching out in every way that I can for that little push to
help me make it through this process. The financial goal is pretty high at this
point, but every avenue I can pursue is a chance for me to continue the path towards my dream.And isn’t that the <i>true</i>
goal in life? To spend every single day doing something you love?</p>
<p>I want to be clear that I am NOT just asking for a handout.
Graduating from a program at William Esper Studio is a life-changing
accomplishment in the world of acting. Although portrayed as glamorous by the
media, only 2% of SAG actors are working. <b><u>2%!</u></b>And they don’t get paying jobs as a favor – they get them through
hard work and building upon their talent. The list of <a href=""http://esperstudio.com/alumni-of-esper-studio/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">former students</a> who have graduated from Wil-Esp can attest to that.</p>
<p><b><u></u></b></p>
<p>I am so appreciative of every dollar that comes my way towards
continuing my education through the William Esper program. If there is a way to
pay back every contributor, I will hopefully find it through the successes that

The phrase ""Limitless Family"" has been used by our students and the team in Rwanda for a while now but during our latest visit was the first time I heard it uttered by teachers and locals in the communities. We are definitely having an impact and being recognized for the extra emotional  support and individualized attention that WAL students receive.  ""Limitless Family"" is not just a phrase though. It has taken on a deep meaning among the students as they discover that just because they are orphans doesn't mean they can't build a vital family of their own. For instance, it is not unusual for a university student to take a bus ride for hours to check in on a WAL child in primary or secondary school who just needs an ""older brother"" to talk to.  There have also been numerous times where students have reached out to me via email to let me know of other WAL student's health issues or even to brag about another child's final exam scores. <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436314573/vox68aq6myu98f8kuc8x.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Our Recent Visit<br/>
</h3> <p>In May we returned to Rwanda to check in on the children and university students. We brought laptops, medical supplies, clothes, toys and school supplies graciously donated by many of you. We had some medical issues to deal with. Jean-Paul had Malaria, Erik was diagnosed with chronic allergic conjunctivitis and Emmanuel has a serious case of varicose veins that makes walking extremely painful. We scheduled his surgery for September to limit the amount of school he will miss but he is having a difficult time right now.</p>
<p>The trip also included a visit to assist our partner in The Democratic Republic of Congo. We delivered a three months supply of food for the 97 children that live in a 200 sq. foot house about 2 hours outside of the border city of Goma. In addition we brought them emergency medical supplies donated by Dr. Shahin Chandrasoma and toothbrushes and toothpaste donated by Jamie Sands, DDS. </p>

<h3>Student Updates<br/>
</h3>The frustrations and stress involved in operating an organization like WAL can be overwhelming. I often find myself staring at the ceiling at night wondering why I have taken on all of this...

But since being moved to Maranatha School she has zoomed to the top of her class - 11th in her class of 85 to be exact.  This is the bright future of Rwanda.<br/></p>

<p>Another standout continues to be Lillian who is ranked 5th in her class of 54. I always like to brag about her because, for those who remember, Lillian was one of the first children we moved from Noel Orphanage and scored terribly low on her school admissions test. <br/></p>

</h3> <p>As we continue to grow we continue to need more help. I understand that there are many places to donate your hard earned money. WAL can easily be looked at as simply another charity doing some good in the world -- but what makes it different from other similar organizations?  Well, the first thing is that we don't have any real overhead. With the exception of 1 full-time and 1 part-time employee on the ground in Rwanda, there are no paid workers. Everyone who works for WAL in the U.S. volunteers their time. That means that about 90% of the money received goes directly to helping a child reach their potential.</p>
<p>This leads into another of WAL's special qualities. Individualized attention. Each child is treated as the individual that they are. Instead of placing all the children in one or two schools, which would allow for easier oversight and management, they attend schools that are best suited for each of them. And though this makes for a lot more travel for our staff to check on them, the children are reaching their full potential more quickly. <br/></p>
<p>But arguably our most unique aspect (especially in that part of the world) is that we are non-faith-based. That is not to say that we are against the numerous faith based organizations that are doing good in Rwanda and all over the world. It's just that we encourage our children to define themselves any way they choose. <br/></p>
<p>WAL does not push any agenda except for critical thinking and looking out for your neighbor.  We speak with our children about building a world where people look out for each other simply because it's the right thing to do and that in doing so it will build a healthy, thriving society. <br/></p>
<p>Without getting too political, after becoming the 21st country to legalize same-sex marriage, the new U.S. law is having a chilling effect on LGBT rights in much of Africa. Rwanda's neighboring countries, Uganda and Congo, have strict anti-gay laws. And though there is discrimination in the <em>predominantly</em> Christian Rwanda, it is one of the few African nations where homosexuality is not illegal -- and we would like to see it stay that way. By teaching tolerance and understanding to our children (and our support team) and letting them know about our gay donors who are partly responsible for their education and well-being, we have begun to see a change in attitudes amongst them. Not surprisingly, education continues to defeat bigotry.<br/></p>

<h3>Sharing Tails</h3> <p>From 2008-2011, Marsh &amp; Associates, LLC presented an exciting, free, state-wide, and on-site, native Arizona fish public outreach program at public elementary schools with funding from US Bureau of Reclamation.  We traveled the state teaching kindergarten through second grade students about our native fish, reaching about 33,000 students and exceeding our goal of 30,000 students. After 2011, federal funds were no longer available to pay for the program. Marsh Education, a not-for-profit 501(c)3 branch of our parent company, Marsh &amp; Associates, LLC was formed to garner support to continue the program.</p>

With partial funding we will be able to lower the fee charged to the schools booked after the campaign. Our goal is to provide this at no charge to all Arizona public schools, so we will work with them to help raise funds for the difference if necessary.</p>
<p>This campaign will only cover the first year, and our goal is to continue indefinitely. We are working hard to secure a new grant, find corporate sponsors, set up an online merchandise store, and brainstorm for more fundraising ideas to keep the program going long term. Initial funding is the stepping stone for providing more funding opportunities since many grants and sponsoring groups require the organization to have matching funds on hand. With a year of funding available we could potentially find funding for the second year right away!</p>

This campaign will only cover the first year, and our goal is to continue indefinitely. We are working hard to secure a new grant, find corporate sponsors, set up an online merchandise store, and brainstorm for more fundraising ideas to keep the program going long term. Initial funding is the stepping stone for providing more funding opportunities since many grants and sponsoring groups require the organization to have matching funds on hand. With a year of funding available we could potentially find funding for the second year right away!

<p>Olá! <b>Sou uma jornalista ambiental profundamente comprometida em fazer o meu melhor para ajudar a salvar a Amazônia</b>. Você encontra mais detalhes sobre quem sou, minha trajetória de cinco anos na floresta e o que faço atualmente no vídeo acima (se as legendas em Português não aparecerem, você pode optar por ver o filme diretamente do Youtube. Clique em Youtube e depois em um ícone à direita para poder ler as legendas). Segue aqui tb o link do vídeo: <b></b></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcUAhmkT4Go"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcUAhmkT4Go</a></p>
<p><b>Atualmente, meu foco de trabalho está em fazer jornalismo de notícias positivas</b> e você poderá ler as coisas que escrevo no blog Unimundo21, que será lançado em breve, fruto de uma parceria com o Portal Vírgula. <b>Também tenho trabalhado para levar pessoas para a floresta amazônica para que elas sintam a floresta e, por meio dela, passem a se conhecer melhor</b>. É uma viagem experiencial que promove autoconhecimento. Faço isso porque <b>acredito que a reconexão amorosa com a Amazônia é fundamental para salvá-la.</b> </p>
<p><b>A ideia do mestrado na Schumacher College veio do fundador da escola, Satish Kumar.</b> Ele tem 78 anos e também é editor da revista Ressurgence. Ele me sugeriu aplicar e disse que os estudos na Schumacher fortaleceriam muito minha atuação em prol da Amazônia. </p>
<p>Eu apliquei, fui aceita. <b>O mestrado custa £ 22,591. Minhas economias, a bolsa de estudos que ganharei da Schumacher + doações que recebi totalizam £ 8, 500. Por isso, preciso de £ 14,000 para conseguir estudar.</b></p>
<p>Você pode contribuir com este mestrado por meio de contribuição financeira ou de divulgação - <b>tudo é válido!</b></p>
<p><b>1 libra = 5 reais. Você pode tanto escolher o valor das recompensas, começando por 10 libras (50 reais) ou então escolher o valor que quiser.</b></p>
<p><b>Se você não puder doar, você pode torcer, compartilhar com seus amigos, fazer 1 minuto de silêncio por dia pela floresta...de novo, tudo é válido.</b></p>
<p><b>Tenho até dia 26 de setembro </b>para ter esse dinheiro e, assim, poder começar o mestrado em 2015.</p>
<p><b>E como este mestrado vai me apoiar em meu trabalho pela Amazônia?</b></p>
<p>Vou aprender <b>novas ferramentas para ensinar a ciência de maneira lúdica e fácil de ser compreendida por pessoas de todas as idades</b>, incluindo jovens e crianças; vou <b>ampliar minha atuação como educadora e palestrante</b> em escolas e universidades; vou <b>aprimorar minhas técnicas para facilitar a reconexão das pessoas com a natureza</b>; na Schumacher College com certeza vou encontrar <b>muitas pautas incríveis para poder compartilhar com meus leitores;</b> vou trabalhar para <b>expandir o Reconexão Amazônia</b> para outras partes do mundo. <i><b>Quanto mais pessoas amarem e se reconetarem emocionalmente com a Amazônia, melhor.</b></i></p>
<p><b>Para você ter uma ideia do meu comprometimento com a Amazônia, por causa dela, eu...</b></p>
<p><b>Mudei de São Paulo para Manaus e Belém</b>. Foram 5 anos morando na região; co-organizei <b>dois eventos TEDx no Pará, o TEDxVer-o-Peso</b>; <b>dou palestras e aulas</b> sobre a floresta para escolas e eventos; estou fazendo um <b>documentário chamado ´O que é Amazônia´ e </b>vou lançar um <b>vídeo blog chamado Perigos na Selva,</b> ambos com <b>fins educacionais</b>; <b>tenho entrevistado líderes espirituais e mentes brilhantes sobre a importância da reconexão amorosa com a Amazônia. Já entrevistei Satish Kumar, Sri Prem Baba, Charles Einsestein, John Croft e esta lista ainda vai crescer.</b></p>
<p>Não importa em qual parte do mundo você está. <b>A Amazônia afeta a vida de todos os seres do planeta. Enquanto eu viver nesta Mãe Terra, darei o meu melhor para protegê-la</b> e despertar o amor das pessoas por ela.</p>
<p><b>Sobre a Amazônia</b></p>
<p>Do alto, do solo ou da água, a Amazônia é um impacto para os olhos. Por seus 6,9 milhões de quilômetros quadrados em nove países sul-americanos (Brasil, Bolívia, Peru, Colômbia, Equador, Venezuela, Guiana, Suriname e Guiana Francesa) espalha-se uma biodiversidade sem paralelos. <b>A Amazônia ocupa 60% do nosso país.</b></p>

<br/><p>Mudanças climáticas estão aí e esta é uma das razões para protegermos a Amazônia antes que seja tarde demais. A seca em São Paulo comprova que <b>o desmatamento já está alterando gravemente os rios voadores</b>, responsáveis por levar parte da chuva que cai sobre a cidade, entre outras regiões. <b>Esta é só a ponta do iceberg. </b></p>
<p><b>A destruição tem aumentado</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438599463/mnqwedpkyfiwqxa7yiot.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p><b>Dada a enorme importância da floresta, o desmatamento infelizmente tem aumentado a passos largos e rápidos.</b> Eu diria até ferozes. De acordo com o Imazon, uma das mais respeitadas organizações que monitoram a floresta, o desmatamento <b>subiu horrendos 282% de fevereiro de 2014 para o mesmo mês em 2015.</b> Em 40 anos, já foram destruídos 22% de floresta, uma área maior do que a Alemanha, Portugal e Itália juntos. <b>Precisamos fazer todo o possível para proteger a Amazônia.</b> </p>
<p>Como lembra o cientista Antonio Nobre, muito sabiamente, ""a Amazônia é insubstituível"".</p>

I am environmental journalist from Brazil. I am truly committed in doing my
best to help saving the Amazon Rainforest. You´ll find more details about the 5
years I lived there in the video above. Nowadays, I am focusing my work in
writing positive and inspiring news. Next month I´ll be launching a blog in partnership with Portal Virgula, in Brazil, called Unimundo21. I
also started the Reconnection Amazon Rainforest Project, where I take people
to the forest and do deep ecology with them, so they will be able to open their hearts to reconnect emotionally with
it. Deep ecology is a
philosophy inspired by Mahatma Gandhi that teaches us how to be in
a much stronger connection within ourselves, nature and the world. I do
this because I believe that the affection between people and the Amazon is very

is a 78 year old Indian activist, editor of Ressurgence magazine and founder of

me that I do this Masters degree? It
will teach me new and very important skills, so I'll be able to work even

be very important to my new way of doing journalism.  My dream is that the

that I've done for the Amazon, so you have an idea of my commitment: I

called 'Dangers of the Jungle', it's an educational project; I am
interviewing great spiritual leaders and brilliant minds asking them the

Sri Prem Baba, Satish Kumar, Charles Einsenstein and John Croft. Along the years I have
been doing this and much more.No matter which part of the

 Português

Olá! Sou uma jornalista ambiental profundamente comprometida em fazer o meu melhor para ajudar a salvar a Amazônia. Você encontra mais detalhes sobre quem sou, minha trajetória de cinco anos na floresta e o que faço atualmente no vídeo acima (se as legendas em Português não aparecerem, você pode optar por ver o filme diretamente do Youtube. Clique em Youtube e depois em um ícone à direita para poder ler as legendas). Segue aqui tb o link do vídeo: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcUAhmkT4Go
Atualmente, meu foco de trabalho está em fazer jornalismo de notícias positivas e você poderá ler as coisas que escrevo no blog Unimundo21, que será lançado em breve, fruto de uma parceria com o Portal Vírgula. Também tenho trabalhado para levar pessoas para a floresta amazônica para que elas sintam a floresta e, por meio dela, passem a se conhecer melhor. É uma viagem experiencial que promove autoconhecimento. Faço isso porque acredito que a reconexão amorosa com a Amazônia é fundamental para salvá-la. 
A ideia do mestrado na Schumacher College veio do fundador da escola, Satish Kumar. Ele tem 78 anos e também é editor da revista Ressurgence. Ele me sugeriu aplicar e disse que os estudos na Schumacher fortaleceriam muito minha atuação em prol da Amazônia. 
Eu apliquei, fui aceita. O mestrado custa £ 22,591. Minhas economias, a bolsa de estudos que ganharei da Schumacher + doações que recebi totalizam £ 8, 500. Por isso, preciso de £ 14,000 para conseguir estudar.
Você pode contribuir com este mestrado por meio de contribuição financeira ou de divulgação - tudo é válido!
1 libra = 5 reais. Você pode tanto escolher o valor das recompensas, começando por 10 libras (50 reais) ou então escolher o valor que quiser.
Se você não puder doar, você pode torcer, compartilhar com seus amigos, fazer 1 minuto de silêncio por dia pela floresta...de novo, tudo é válido.
Tenho até dia 26 de setembro para ter esse dinheiro e, assim, poder começar o mestrado em 2015.
E como este mestrado vai me apoiar em meu trabalho pela Amazônia?
Vou aprender novas ferramentas para ensinar a ciência de maneira lúdica e fácil de ser compreendida por pessoas de todas as idades, incluindo jovens e crianças; vou ampliar minha atuação como educadora e palestrante em escolas e universidades; vou aprimorar minhas técnicas para facilitar a reconexão das pessoas com a natureza; na Schumacher College com certeza vou encontrar muitas pautas incríveis para poder compartilhar com meus leitores; vou trabalhar para expandir o Reconexão Amazônia para outras partes do mundo. Quanto mais pessoas amarem e se reconetarem emocionalmente com a Amazônia, melhor.
Para você ter uma ideia do meu comprometimento com a Amazônia, por causa dela, eu...
Mudei de São Paulo para Manaus e Belém. Foram 5 anos morando na região; co-organizei dois eventos TEDx no Pará, o TEDxVer-o-Peso; dou palestras e aulas sobre a floresta para escolas e eventos; estou fazendo um documentário chamado ´O que é Amazônia´ e vou lançar um vídeo blog chamado Perigos na Selva, ambos com fins educacionais; tenho entrevistado líderes espirituais e mentes brilhantes sobre a importância da reconexão amorosa com a Amazônia. Já entrevistei Satish Kumar, Sri Prem Baba, Charles Einsestein, John Croft e esta lista ainda vai crescer.
Não importa em qual parte do mundo você está. A Amazônia afeta a vida de todos os seres do planeta. Enquanto eu viver nesta Mãe Terra, darei o meu melhor para protegê-la e despertar o amor das pessoas por ela.
Sobre a Amazônia
Do alto, do solo ou da água, a Amazônia é um impacto para os olhos. Por seus 6,9 milhões de quilômetros quadrados em nove países sul-americanos (Brasil, Bolívia, Peru, Colômbia, Equador, Venezuela, Guiana, Suriname e Guiana Francesa) espalha-se uma biodiversidade sem paralelos. A Amazônia ocupa 60% do nosso país.


Mudanças climáticas estão aí e esta é uma das razões para protegermos a Amazônia antes que seja tarde demais. A seca em São Paulo comprova que o desmatamento já está alterando gravemente os rios voadores, responsáveis por levar parte da chuva que cai sobre a cidade, entre outras regiões. Esta é só a ponta do iceberg. 
A destruição tem aumentado


Dada a enorme importância da floresta, o desmatamento infelizmente tem aumentado a passos largos e rápidos. Eu diria até ferozes. De acordo com o Imazon, uma das mais respeitadas organizações que monitoram a floresta, o desmatamento subiu horrendos 282% de fevereiro de 2014 para o mesmo mês em 2015. Em 40 anos, já foram destruídos 22% de floresta, uma área maior do que a Alemanha, Portugal e Itália juntos. Precisamos fazer todo o possível para proteger a Amazônia. 
Como lembra o cientista Antonio Nobre, muito sabiamente, ""a Amazônia é insubstituível"".
Te convido a entrar nessa junto comigo!

</h2>
<p><i>''Qu'un
péruvien réagisse à la réflexion d'un belge francophone sur la
façon dont la conquête spatiale a transformé certaines façons
d'appréhender la réalité, et qu'un néo-zélandais s'étonne de la
manière dont les deux envisagent la question.</i></p>
<p><i>Tout
cela sans qu'aucun des trois ne parle la langue des autres. </i>
</p>
<p><i>Ils
ont en commun l'intérêt pour le thème et la volonté de nourrir
leur réflexion en ouvrant le champ des points de vue.''</i></p>
<p><i><b>C'est
tout le projet des</b> <b>Jardins</b>
<b>de la réflexion</b>.
</i>
</p>
<p>LesJardins
de la réflexion seront un site où des réflexions sur des questions
contemporaines sont poursuivies entre personnes issues de différentes
aires linguistiques, à commencer par les aires française, anglaise
et espagnole.</p>
<p><b>L'interculturalité
est au cœur des Jardins de la réflexion </b>:
L'interculturalité, ce n'est pas que tous s'expriment en une seule
langue, mais que toutes les langues, avec leur génie propre,
puissent communiquer entre elles. Internet parle une grande diversité
de langues. Les Jardins favorisent la mise en relation d'internautes
s'exprimant en différentes langues sans comprendre nécessairement
celles de leurs interlocuteurs 
</p>
<p><b>Le</b>
<b>principe</b> : 
</p>
<p>Des
dissertations (&lt; 2500 mots) seront simultanément publiées dans
ces langues, auxquelles des commentaires (&lt;400 mots) et d'autres
dissertations répondront, afin de faire avancer la réflexion. Les
Jardins de la réflexion offrent à leurs membres contributeurs un
travail éditorial comme la traduction dans toutes les langues en
usage dans les jardins au moment de la publication.</p>
<p><b>Ces
Jardins</b> sont <b>une</b> <b>agora </b> où débattre avec
intelligence, raison, ouverture d'esprit et bienveillance, de grands
sujets relatifs à l'Homme et à la planète. Pas un site où poster
des ''lolcats'', un véritable lieu de production intellectuelle.</p>
<p><b>Pour
qui sont les Jardins de la réflexion ?</b></p>
<p>Destinés
aux ''honnêtes hommes'' à travers le monde,Les Jardins de la
réflexion sont dédiés à ses membres, simples lecteurs ou
contributeurs (auteurs de dissertations et de commentaires). Tous ont
souscrit à une formules d'abonnement.</p>
<p>Ces
abonnements ont pour vocation la pérennité, le rayonnement et le
développement des Jardins de la réflexion en vue d'offrir un
service toujours plus interculturel, universel et efficace.</p>
<p>Les
abonnements ont aussi pour vocation de développer et faire vivre un
réseau international autonome d'intellectuels hors institutions.</p>

Rassemblons
une communauté interculturelle de réflexion sur des questions
contemporaines 

''Qu'un
péruvien réagisse à la réflexion d'un belge francophone sur la
façon dont la conquête spatiale a transformé certaines façons
d'appréhender la réalité, et qu'un néo-zélandais s'étonne de la
manière dont les deux envisagent la question.
Tout
cela sans qu'aucun des trois ne parle la langue des autres. 

Ils
ont en commun l'intérêt pour le thème et la volonté de nourrir
leur réflexion en ouvrant le champ des points de vue.''
C'est
tout le projet des Jardins
de la réflexion.


LesJardins
de la réflexion seront un site où des réflexions sur des questions
contemporaines sont poursuivies entre personnes issues de différentes
aires linguistiques, à commencer par les aires française, anglaise
et espagnole.
L'interculturalité
est au cœur des Jardins de la réflexion :
L'interculturalité, ce n'est pas que tous s'expriment en une seule
langue, mais que toutes les langues, avec leur génie propre,
puissent communiquer entre elles. Internet parle une grande diversité
de langues. Les Jardins favorisent la mise en relation d'internautes
s'exprimant en différentes langues sans comprendre nécessairement
celles de leurs interlocuteurs 

Le
principe : 

Des
dissertations (< 2500 mots) seront simultanément publiées dans
ces langues, auxquelles des commentaires (<400 mots) et d'autres
dissertations répondront, afin de faire avancer la réflexion. Les
Jardins de la réflexion offrent à leurs membres contributeurs un
travail éditorial comme la traduction dans toutes les langues en
usage dans les jardins au moment de la publication.
Ces
Jardins sont une agora  où débattre avec
intelligence, raison, ouverture d'esprit et bienveillance, de grands
sujets relatifs à l'Homme et à la planète. Pas un site où poster
des ''lolcats'', un véritable lieu de production intellectuelle.
Pour
qui sont les Jardins de la réflexion ?
Destinés
aux ''honnêtes hommes'' à travers le monde,Les Jardins de la
réflexion sont dédiés à ses membres, simples lecteurs ou
contributeurs (auteurs de dissertations et de commentaires). Tous ont
souscrit à une formules d'abonnement.
Ces
abonnements ont pour vocation la pérennité, le rayonnement et le
développement des Jardins de la réflexion en vue d'offrir un
service toujours plus interculturel, universel et efficace.
Les
abonnements ont aussi pour vocation de développer et faire vivre un
réseau international autonome d'intellectuels hors institutions.
Votre aide?
Les
Jardins de la réflexion sont un concept révolutionnaire de mise en
relation à l'échelle de l'humanité pour réfléchir ensemble.
Qui
d'autre que vous, donateurs, enthousiastes et généreux donnerait
l'opportunité à un concept sans précédent de devenir une
réalité ? 


	Vos dons seront la
	preuve tangible de la pertinence d'un concept favorisant une plus
	large ouverture de la communication entre les hommes à l'échelle
	de la planète. Nous comptons donc pleinement sur votre

Tout
	est prêt : la maquette et les idées, les fichiers
	d'adresses et les dissertations inaugurales. Il ne reste qu'à

	fonctionner les Jardins pendant 18 mois, le temps d'atteindre

Los Jardines del pensamiento



Una
comunidad intercultural de reflexión sobre temas contemporáneos 



«Que
un peruano pueda responder a la reflexión de un belga francófono
sobre la forma en que la conquista espacial ha transformado la forma
de aprehender la realidad o que un neozelandés se sorprenda con la
manera con la que ambos enfocan la cuestión.

Y todo esto sin que ninguno de los tres
hable el idioma de los demás.

Lo que tienen en común es el interés
por el tema y la voluntad de alimentar su reflexión abriéndose a
nuevos puntos de vista».


Este
es el proyecto Jardines
del Pensamiento


Jardines
del Pensamiento será
una página web en la que se podrán presentar reflexiones sobre
temas contemporáneos para comentarlos con personas pertenecientes a
diferentes ámbitos lingüísticos, empezando por los hablantes de
francés, inglés y español.

Jardines
del Pensamiento está
basado en la interculturalidad:
La interculturalidad no
consiste en que todos se expresen en un único idioma sino que todas
las lenguas, manteniendo su propia esencia, puedan comunicarse entre
ellas. Internet habla una gran diversidad de idiomas. Jardines
favorece
el contacto de internautas que se expresan en diferentes lenguas sin
tener que comprender necesariamente la de sus interlocutores.

La
base:
Se publicaran disertaciones (< 2.500 palabras) en estos idiomas
simultáneamente, a las que se podrá responder con comentarios (<
400 palabras) y otras disertaciones y así impulsar la reflexión.
Jardines
del Pensamiento ofrece
a sus miembros colaboradores un trabajo editorial, como la traducción
a todos los idiomas en uso en los Jardines
en el momento de la
publicación.

Estos
Jardines
serán un
ágora
en
la que se podrá debatir con inteligencia, racionalidad, amplitud de
miras y benevolencia grandes temas relativos al Ser Humano y al
planeta. No una web a la que subir «lolcats»
(combinación de la fotografía de un gato con un texto humorístico)
sino un verdadero lugar de producción intelectual. 



¿Para quién son los Jardines del
Pensamiento?
Destinados
a las personas de bien de todo el mundo, los Jardines
del Pensamiento están
dedicados a sus miembros, ya sean simples lectores o colaboradores
(autores de disertaciones y comentarios). Todos estarán suscritos
mediante un abono.

El
objetivo de estos abonos es la perennidad, la proyección y el
desarrollo de los Jardines
del Pensamiento para
poder ofrecer un servicio cada vez más intercultural, universal y
eficaz. 


Los abonos servirán también para
desarrollar y dinamizar una red internacional autónoma de
intelectuales creada al margen de las instituciones.
¿Cómo
puede ayudar?
Los
Jardines
del Pensamiento es
un concepto revolucionario pensado para poner en contacto a la
humanidad, para poder llevar a cabo una reflexión conjunta.


¿Quién
más, aparte de vosotros, mecenas,
entusiastas y generosos daría una oportunidad a este concepto sin
precedentes de convertirse en una realidad ?



	Vuestras donaciones serán la prueba
	tangible de la pertinencia de un concepto creado para favorecer la
	apertura de la comunicación entre personas de todo el planeta.
	Contamos plenamente con vuestro discernimiento. 
	




Está todo listo:
	la maqueta y las
	ideas, los listados de direcciones y las disertaciones inaugurales.
	Solo falta subirlo a la red. Con vuestra ayuda los Jardines
podrá funcionar
	durante 18 meses, mientras consigue una autonomía financiera
	con un número
	suficiente de abonados.



¿A
qué se destinarán vuestras aportaciones?


		El
		dinero reunido servirá para financiar el proyecto durante su
		periodo de consolidación:



Herramientas,
	servicios y prestaciones de política editorial, traducciones;


Desarrollo
	de la plataforma en Internet, adquisición de herramientas y
	servicios;


Desarrollo
	de la visibilidad de los Jardines.




Entre
todos podemos dar vida a este sueño:
En
diez años, los Jardines
del Pensamiento llegará
a internautas pertenecientes a los 10 principales ámbitos
lingüísticos o, lo que es lo mismo, el 85% de todos los usuarios de
Internet en todo el mundo, para convertirse en una comunidad
intercultural de reflexión sobre los temas contemporáneos de
referencia.

	100 nuevos temas de reflexión al año;

<h3><b>For those unfamiliar with the
region</b></h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>The monastery of Lamayuru is one of the most ancient
monasterys of Ladakh. Believed to be founded by the scholar Naropa in 1018 and
located at a height of 3,510 meters (11,520 ft), it has hosted for almost a
millennium a community of the Drikung Kagyu Buddhist order. </p>
<p>Notwithstanding the recent development of
some domestic and foreign tourism, the area is still economically very weak.
The population depends on livestock (yak, sheep and Pashmina goats) and on the
cultivation of barley. </p>
<p>The extremely hard living conditions of the
region are driving the young population to leave the valleys, draining the
traditional way life and an exceptionally sophisticated and ancient culture.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>The school</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Since 1985, the monastery has hosted a
state school where children receive modern and traditional education. Hindi,
English and mathematics are taught along with Sanskrit and ceremonial matters.
Most of the children (they currently number 20, aged 6 to 12), come from the remote
and extremely poor villages of the surrounding valleys. The Lamayuru Gonpa School
is like a second home to them and affords them what is almost certainly their
only opportunity of a formal education. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431948191/vf2nrkqfp2xexzgewzvk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<p></p>
At the moment, the accommodation this school can
offer is, however, precarious at best. Only one room is
available to the children, and it has to be used both for teaching and as a
hostel. Moreover, this single room lacks hygienic facilities and is part of a
building that faces serious risk of collapse. Due to these precarious
conditions, during the summer, lessons have to take place outdoors, while
during the winter, when the temperature drops well below –20 degrees, the children
are left without any serious protection from the cold.<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431368900/nkdctcozik8nicd6yzqs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p></p> <div> <h3></h3>
</div>
<h3>Why Funds are Needed</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>The building of
a new school is urgently needed, as it would permit a better education and
better living conditions for these wonderful children. </p>
<p>Our aim is to replace
the old building with a new one, with 4 double-use rooms (for teaching and
accommodation) washing and toilet facilities. </p>
<p>Raising the number of teaching rooms from 1
to 4 would allow for a sub-division of the children by age group and subject
taught, to the educational benefit of all , while the combined residential
facilities would give the children a place in which to grow up safely and in a
dignified way. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Moreover, a glazed veranda will cover the
whole building. This is very important for us in order to deal with the extreme
cold of the Himalayan winters, there being no heating facilities!</span><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>

<br/><h3><b>The project in more detail</b></h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>The building will consist of 4 double use
classrooms/bedrooms (red in the plan below), one office and one guest or store room (green), plus 3 modern
toilets with washing facilities (blue).</p>
<p>We plan to lay down strong foundations and to
leave room for the future addition of stairs, because we hope to build a second
floor in years to come.</p>

<br/><p></p>Plans have been drawn up by Thinley Zangpo, a Ladakhi civil engineer. He has been working for free (thank you Thinley!).</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p>The material and the building techniques we
are planning to employ will all be traditional, because this will lower the
construction costs and add to the sustainability of the building. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The <b>wall</b>
will be in sun dried brick masonry, the <b>roofing</b>
in local type talbu laid over local type round ballies. The <b>flooring</b> of the building will be in
wooden planks, finished with mud plaster. Part of the material (wood, cement
for the foundations and the material for the veranda) will have to be brought
in from Leh, as it is locally unavailable, but the labour, both for the
building stage and the maintenance, will be local. As the monastery is located
on a hill top and the school area is unreachable by means of mechanical
transport, the material will have to be carried by hand.</p>

For those unfamiliar with the
region


The monastery of Lamayuru is one of the most ancient
monasterys of Ladakh. Believed to be founded by the scholar Naropa in 1018 and
located at a height of 3,510 meters (11,520 ft), it has hosted for almost a
millennium a community of the Drikung Kagyu Buddhist order. 
Notwithstanding the recent development of
some domestic and foreign tourism, the area is still economically very weak.
The population depends on livestock (yak, sheep and Pashmina goats) and on the
cultivation of barley. 
The extremely hard living conditions of the
region are driving the young population to leave the valleys, draining the
traditional way life and an exceptionally sophisticated and ancient culture.

The school



Since 1985, the monastery has hosted a
state school where children receive modern and traditional education. Hindi,
English and mathematics are taught along with Sanskrit and ceremonial matters.
Most of the children (they currently number 20, aged 6 to 12), come from the remote
and extremely poor villages of the surrounding valleys. The Lamayuru Gonpa School
is like a second home to them and affords them what is almost certainly their
only opportunity of a formal education. 







At the moment, the accommodation this school can
offer is, however, precarious at best. Only one room is
available to the children, and it has to be used both for teaching and as a
hostel. Moreover, this single room lacks hygienic facilities and is part of a
building that faces serious risk of collapse. Due to these precarious
conditions, during the summer, lessons have to take place outdoors, while
during the winter, when the temperature drops well below –20 degrees, the children
are left without any serious protection from the cold.



  

Why Funds are Needed


The building of
a new school is urgently needed, as it would permit a better education and
better living conditions for these wonderful children. 
Our aim is to replace
the old building with a new one, with 4 double-use rooms (for teaching and
accommodation) washing and toilet facilities. 
Raising the number of teaching rooms from 1
to 4 would allow for a sub-division of the children by age group and subject
taught, to the educational benefit of all , while the combined residential
facilities would give the children a place in which to grow up safely and in a
dignified way. 
Moreover, a glazed veranda will cover the
whole building. This is very important for us in order to deal with the extreme
cold of the Himalayan winters, there being no heating facilities!






The project in more detail


The building will consist of 4 double use
classrooms/bedrooms (red in the plan below), one office and one guest or store room (green), plus 3 modern
toilets with washing facilities (blue).
We plan to lay down strong foundations and to
leave room for the future addition of stairs, because we hope to build a second
floor in years to come.

Plans have been drawn up by Thinley Zangpo, a Ladakhi civil engineer. He has been working for free (thank you Thinley!).
The material and the building techniques we
are planning to employ will all be traditional, because this will lower the
construction costs and add to the sustainability of the building. 


The wall
will be in sun dried brick masonry, the roofing
in local type talbu laid over local type round ballies. The flooring of the building will be in
wooden planks, finished with mud plaster. Part of the material (wood, cement
for the foundations and the material for the veranda) will have to be brought
in from Leh, as it is locally unavailable, but the labour, both for the
building stage and the maintenance, will be local. As the monastery is located
on a hill top and the school area is unreachable by means of mechanical
transport, the material will have to be carried by hand.


Who are we


Lama Tashi Dorjai: I am a Ladaki monk and a school teacher.
I was born in a tiny village not far from Lamayuru, and lived and studied at
the old Lamayuru Gonpa School. That’s why I understand the children's needs and I
am so fond of this project. I am also the Monastery Secretary and this allows me
to manage the works for the new school. 





Chiara Steindler: I am a researcher in International Relations and I live in Florence, Italy. You can google my name to learn more about my work. But, more importantly, I have been travelling a lot on the Himalayas, and when I reached Ladakh, I fell in love with the beauty of this land and the kindness of its people and decided to spend as much time here as possible. In fact, now I am here to help with whatever is needed for the new Lamayuru Gonpa School. 

But many more
people are helping us with our project, among them, John Hunt, CO of the Lotus Flower Trust, he has a huge experience in building schools in remote places and  has been advising us since the beginning;  Ilona
Krizhanivska, she is a great
photographer from Tajikistan (most of the pictures on this page are hers – that is, the nice ones); Michele Steindler, he is an electronic engineer and lives in Paris, France. Andrea Quercetelli, he is a business consultant from Florence, Italy. He helped us understand many things about the funding for the school.


Where the Money Will Go


Our budget is of $50.000, 10% has been
added to cover
platform fees, bank/credit card charges, perks and shipment costs for
supporters.
Beyond that, all of the funds will be
employed for the building of the school, with no administrative or other kind
of overheads. The money you donate will go into the bank account of the
Lamayuru Monastery and will be used under the supervision of Lama Tashi Dorjai,
Secretary of the Monastery. 





That’s about it! 
We are ready to go and will start the works in August this year. Our deadline to have the building ready is October 2016. With each step reached, we'll bring you updates from the field. We don't want to pester you with unwanted mails (we all receive too many!) so we will include you in our mailing list only if you explicitly ask us to. But you will be always able to follow the progress on the Facebook page of the school.



And so
we invite you to get involved. 




We have a nice variety of perks ready for you,
including the colourful good-luck prayer flags, original
pictures of the photographer Ilona Krizhanivska, or the
Katagh, the white scarf that is used to honour wise men and women.Additionally,
for everyone making a donation of $25 or more, we'll include your name on
a dedication plaque to be installed in the new school. Maybe
it's just me, but I would like to have my name engraved on a school wall
surrounded by the Himalayan mountains! But check out the right side of the page
for the many ways we will say thank you for your contribution.
Apart
from contributing with your credit card, you can also spread the news among
your friends and relatives and on social media.

If you are not able to make a financial
contribution don't worry at all, that's not the only way to help. If you have a
particular skill related to the project or are an experienced teacher, you can
join as a volunteer.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

Dyslexia is a learning disability characterised by trouble reading despite a normal intelligence. Problems may include spelling words, reading quickly, pronouncing words when reading aloud, and understanding what was read.
However, having dyslexia does not mean that one’s ability to learn is below average. In fact, many people with dyslexia are smart and motivated to learn. But not being able to read well can make many areas of learning a problem. Hence, they need to receive help from professional therapists. 





About DAS

The DAS (Dyslexia Association of Singapore) is an organization that was founded in 1991 and aims to build a world class organisation dedicated to helping dyslexic people and those with specific learning differences in Singapore. 
DAS specialist psychologists conduct assessment and diagnosis for preschool students to adults. DAS Educational Therapists and Speech and Language Therapists provide support for over 3000 preschool, primary and secondary school students in 13 centres all over Singapore. 



How can we help?

</div><p>I have a crazy idea. I want everyone in the world to be a journalist. You see, journalism is having quite a moment. Everywhere you turn today, someone is creating headline news, using only their cellphone. There is the citizen journalist in <a href=""http://time.com/3841077/baltimore-protests-riot-freddie-gray-devin-allen/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Baltimore</a> whose pictures appeared on the cover of TIME magazine.

What will you do when news happens near you? Will you capture it? I hope to teach you how, with MOJOPro.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>So…What’s a MOJOPro?</b></p>
<p>MOJOPro is the world’s first online academy dedicated to teaching mobile journalism to everyday people. I believe everyone has a story. If you have a cellphone, you can share it with the world. It’s not all point, shoot and post though! It takes skill to put together a compelling video or audio documentary that someone will want to view or listen to—all the way through. MOJOPro has a lesson for that. Also, did you know that there are apps and accessories that can make your footage look and sound better? MOJOPro has a lesson for that. Did you know that there are key ways to build relationships with professional journalists who can get your message to a broader audience? Yes, MOJOPro has a lesson for that too.</p>
<p>If you haven't guessed it, MOJO is short for mobile journalist and I have been grooming MOJOs all over the world for the last five years. My name is <a href=""www.profallissa.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Allissa Richardson</a>, and I am a mobile journalism professor at Bowie State University, just outside of Washington, DC. I have traveled the globe to teach youth how to shoot and edit video news stories using only an iPod or an iPhone. I have taught girls in South Africa how to report on community issues. I have taught ladies in Morocco to report on their lives as Arab women. I even launched two MOJO Labs at American colleges. The results have been pretty phenomenal. My MOJOs have gotten jobs at leading news organizations, like CNN, BBC and <i>The New York Times</i>. </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FRd2yJpekVhU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DRd2yJpekVhU&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FRd2yJpekVhU%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>As for me, Apple, Inc. named me one of its Distinguished Educators. Also, Harvard University invited me to come to its campus last year, as a journalism fellow. As I was giving my farewell lecture to the students there, the idea for MOJOPro was solidified. I realized that MOJOPro could be my way of expanding my effort as a mobile journalism professor. I can only be in one place at any given time, but launching MOJOPro will allow me to deploy more than two dozen self-paced, online courses to anybody in the world, anytime! MOJOPro students will be able to earn badges, certificates and possible exposure to mainstream media outlets. This is where you can help. </p>
<p><b>So...What do you need?</b></p>
<p>Glad you asked! The beta version of our MOJOPro website launches in September, and my team could use a little help polishing the e-commerce elements of the site before then. In addition to offering online courses, we got the ambitious idea to sell MOJO gear too, so we need a few more team members to help us add on these features. We also need funding for the first leg of our launch tour, which includes stops at the nation’s top journalism schools, so we can demo the MOJOPro platform to students and teachers.

Everywhere you turn today, someone is creating headline news, using only their cellphone. There is the citizen journalist in Baltimore whose pictures appeared on the cover of TIME magazine. The live Tweets of Ferguson protestors airing on CNN. What will you do when news happens near you? Will you capture it? I hope to teach you how, with MOJOPro.

So…What’s a MOJOPro?
MOJOPro is the world’s first online academy dedicated to teaching mobile journalism to everyday people. I believe everyone has a story. If you have a cellphone, you can share it with the world. It’s not all point, shoot and post though! It takes skill to put together a compelling video or audio documentary that someone will want to view or listen to—all the way through. MOJOPro has a lesson for that. Also, did you know that there are apps and accessories that can make your footage look and sound better? MOJOPro has a lesson for that. Did you know that there are key ways to build relationships with professional journalists who can get your message to a broader audience? Yes, MOJOPro has a lesson for that too.
If you haven't guessed it, MOJO is short for mobile journalist and I have been grooming MOJOs all over the world for the last five years. My name is Allissa Richardson, and I am a mobile journalism professor at Bowie State University, just outside of Washington, DC. I have traveled the globe to teach youth how to shoot and edit video news stories using only an iPod or an iPhone. I have taught girls in South Africa how to report on community issues. I have taught ladies in Morocco to report on their lives as Arab women. I even launched two MOJO Labs at American colleges. The results have been pretty phenomenal. My MOJOs have gotten jobs at leading news organizations, like CNN, BBC and The New York Times. 
As for me, Apple, Inc. named me one of its Distinguished Educators. Also, Harvard University invited me to come to its campus last year, as a journalism fellow. As I was giving my farewell lecture to the students there, the idea for MOJOPro was solidified. I realized that MOJOPro could be my way of expanding my effort as a mobile journalism professor. I can only be in one place at any given time, but launching MOJOPro will allow me to deploy more than two dozen self-paced, online courses to anybody in the world, anytime! MOJOPro students will be able to earn badges, certificates and possible exposure to mainstream media outlets. This is where you can help. 
So...What do you need?
Glad you asked! The beta version of our MOJOPro website launches in September, and my team could use a little help polishing the e-commerce elements of the site before then. In addition to offering online courses, we got the ambitious idea to sell MOJO gear too, so we need a few more team members to help us add on these features. We also need funding for the first leg of our launch tour, which includes stops at the nation’s top journalism schools, so we can demo the MOJOPro platform to students and teachers. We need $10,000 to reach our goal. That buys us several more rounds of coding, editing and publicity planning with our gurus! You can support us at six different levels.

In each of these projects, everybody left with more than just the main theme - we learned the importance of respect, curiosity and resilience. We hope to continue providing these experiences for both the kids we work with and BE fellows - to expand their worldview and shape global citizens.  
    Risk and challenges

If we don't achieve our goal, the quality and scope of the events we do will definitely decrease, but our enthusiasm will still be high. We aim to give the best experiences possible to our students and fellows.

    Other ways you can help us If you can't help us by donating right now you can share this campaign with people who would be interested in supporting us!

<p>Hallo ihr Lieben,</p>
<p>mein Name ist Annika Cost, ich bin 22 Jahre alt und mache
gerade meinen Bachelor in Physiotherapie an der Hochschule Fresenius in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Mein großer Traum ist es, danach für einen Masterstudiengang 2
Jahre nach Australien zu gehen. Um mir diesen Wunsch zu erfüllen habe ich neben
meinem Studium zwei Jobs. Ich massiere in einem Hotelspa und gebe viel  Nachhilfe, sowohl über ein Unternehmen als
auch privat. Leider ist mein Ziel trotzdem in sehr weiter Ferne, weil die Studiengebühren in Australien sehr
hoch sind. Ich hoffe ich werde es schaffen meinen Lebensunterhalt zusammen zu
sparen, aber dann bleiben immer noch 50.000€ Studiengebühren übrig, von denen ich
25.000€ über diese Kampagne zusammen bekommen will. Für das restliche Geld
werde ich mich um verschiedene Stipendien bewerben. Viele werden sich jetzt
fragen warum dann gerade Australien?! Australien oder genauer gesagt „The
University of South Australia“ in Adelaide, weil es dort im Fachbereich
Physiotherapie einen der besten Masterstudiengänge weltweit gibt und ich der
festen Überzeugung bin, dass Australien mir die besten Voraussetzungen bietet
um später mal eine gute, erfolgreiche Therapeutin zu sein. Außerdem werden meine
zukünftigen Patienten sehr von dieser Ausbildung und meinen Erfahrungen
profitieren. Auch, weil mich dieses Abenteuer persönlich sehr viel
weiter bringen wird. Vor allem in meinem Beruf halte ich den interkulturellen
Austausch für besonders wichtig, da man immer für verschiedene Behandlungsansätze
offen sein sollte um eine qualitativ hochwertige Therapie zu gewährleisten. Dieses Projekt ist dafür hervorragend geeignet, weil Australien in der
Physiotherapie einer der großen Vorreiter ist und auch im Bereich Forschung
schon große Erfolge erzielt hat.</p>
<p>Ich denke, was ich in den zwei Jahren lernen und an

On April 25, 2015, a powerful earthquake hit Nepal. The disaster killed over 5,000 people and has left thousands of others without resources and susceptible to the harrowing effects of a region without stable infrastructure after a natural disaster of this magnitude.


Nathan Demers and his family live in Pokhara, Nepal, one of the mountainous regions hit by the earthquake. Nathan is an experienced emergency relief organizer and he and his wife, Ganga, have been working with other members of their community to bring relief to the hardest-hit, most remote regions of Nepal. 


He and others have travelled to the regions between Gorkha and Everest to assess the needs of devastated mountain communities. Please consider contributing to their campaign so that they may continue to bring supplies to the people of Nepal.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<h4>
We at <i>Jack The Bike Man</i> are asking for your financial help to place a bike in the hands of a needy child at this year's Holiday Giveaway, which for many children, will be the only gift they receive.  We estimate that it costs <i>Jack The Bike Man</i> about $100 for 
each bike he gives away. This takes into account parts, labor, overhead and rent 
for our large warehouse as well as the included brand new bike helmet given with each children's bike. This year we would like to include a 
locking chain with each bike. No contribution is too small and as you can see on the right side of this page, we've got some great Perks to give away. So please, help today by making a contribution or spreading the word about our campaign!</h4>

</div><br/><h3>Mission Statement</h3>The Mission of ""Jack the Bike Man"" is to provide education, guidance and
 training to at-risk children  and their parents with bike training programs and 
other projects.<br/><br/><h3>Vision Statement</h3><i></i><i>Jack the Bike Man, Inc.</i>'s vision is to provide social conduct guidance and emotional support through bicycle education programs provided by staff and volunteers. It is our vision to teach responsibility, family values, honesty, trust and self esteem. This will aid local youth in becoming productive members of our society, less inclined to become involved with gang activities. <br/><br/><h3>After-School/Summer Program</h3><i>Jack the Bike Man, Inc.</i> is working to change the lives of local area youth through bicycle education. Each month <i>Jack the Bike Man</i> will provide after-school training to 3-4 students twice a week. The program consists of 4 main components: bicycle repair and safety, informal mentorship, physical education, and community service. Each student will receive a bicycle, tools, a helmet, and bike lights. Each graduate of the program is encouraged to return as a volunteer in all future after-school programs. Our goal is to improve struggling students' overall quality of life by providing guidance and support to succeed in school and in life.<br/><br/><h3>Teen Programs </h3>Teens wanting a bicycle are welcome to volunteer at <i>Jack the Bike Man</i> in exchange for a bicycle. All volunteers are to repair 3 bicycles, one bike for <i>Jack the Bike Man </i>to use in our programs of helping youth., one to give to a friend without a bike or means to purchase one, and the last one that they fix, the volunteer may keep themselves.<br/><br/><h3>Adult Programs </h3><i>Jack the Bike Man</i> seeks to expand it's reach to Palm Beach County homeless families and to adults in recovery so that they may also learn basic bicycle mechanics while earning a bicycle for themselves.  Now it will be much easier to get to job interviews. This way if their bicycle is in need of repair, they will have the basic knowledge to do so as well as knowing that they can come back to us for repairs.<br/><br/><h3>Bike Shop </h3>As part of our fundraising for the Children's Charity, we sell new and used restored bikes starting at $130. We rent bicycles for $30 a day with a required deposit of the same amount as the value of the bicycle. In our shop we sell bicycle parts and supplies as well as provide bicycle repairs by our trained mechanics.<br/><br/><h3>Bike Collection</h3>Neighborhood associations, Home Owners Associations, and gated communities can collect bikes in their neighborhood and arrangements can be made with <i>Jack the Bike Man</i> to have all the bikes at a specific location where the bikes can be picked up by a <i>Jack the Bike Man</i> volunteer. Some communities have matching grant programs for improving and beautifying the communities. All of the volunteer hours donated in collecting the bikes can go towards those grants. <br/><br/><h3>Other ways to help...</h3>There are many volunteer opportunities available; pick up bicycles, repair bicycles, office work, building maintenance, fund raising committee, event committee, Special outreach committee, board of directors, Program sponsorship, event sponsorship, working on youth programs, teach repair and maintenance of bicycles.<br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F36606034&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F36606034&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F251148305_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/>Video produced by Road Holland when Jack The Bike Man was at a smaller location.<br/><br/></div>","Jack the Bike Man, Inc. is a South Florida not for profit children's bicycle charity founded by Samuel H. “Jack” Hairston III.  For over ten years now he and his volunteers have fixed bikes and handed them out to needy children in the area,  especially around the holidays when Jack has his biggest bike give away of the year.

each bike he gives away. This takes into account parts, labor, overhead and rent 
for our large warehouse as well as the included brand new bike helmet given with each children's bike. This year we would like to include a 
locking chain with each bike. No contribution is too small and as you can see on the right side of this page, we've got some great Perks to give away. So please, help today by making a contribution or spreading the word about our campaign!
Every little bit counts for something on a bike:





All proceeds will be put to use supporting this beloved charity. 

Mission StatementThe Mission of ""Jack the Bike Man"" is to provide education, guidance and
 training to at-risk children  and their parents with bike training programs and 
other projects.Vision StatementJack the Bike Man, Inc.'s vision is to provide social conduct guidance and emotional support through bicycle education programs provided by staff and volunteers. It is our vision to teach responsibility, family values, honesty, trust and self esteem. This will aid local youth in becoming productive members of our society, less inclined to become involved with gang activities. After-School/Summer ProgramJack the Bike Man, Inc. is working to change the lives of local area youth through bicycle education. Each month Jack the Bike Man will provide after-school training to 3-4 students twice a week. The program consists of 4 main components: bicycle repair and safety, informal mentorship, physical education, and community service. Each student will receive a bicycle, tools, a helmet, and bike lights. Each graduate of the program is encouraged to return as a volunteer in all future after-school programs. Our goal is to improve struggling students' overall quality of life by providing guidance and support to succeed in school and in life.Teen Programs Teens wanting a bicycle are welcome to volunteer at Jack the Bike Man in exchange for a bicycle. All volunteers are to repair 3 bicycles, one bike for Jack the Bike Man to use in our programs of helping youth., one to give to a friend without a bike or means to purchase one, and the last one that they fix, the volunteer may keep themselves.Adult Programs Jack the Bike Man seeks to expand it's reach to Palm Beach County homeless families and to adults in recovery so that they may also learn basic bicycle mechanics while earning a bicycle for themselves.  Now it will be much easier to get to job interviews. This way if their bicycle is in need of repair, they will have the basic knowledge to do so as well as knowing that they can come back to us for repairs.Bike Shop As part of our fundraising for the Children's Charity, we sell new and used restored bikes starting at $130. We rent bicycles for $30 a day with a required deposit of the same amount as the value of the bicycle. In our shop we sell bicycle parts and supplies as well as provide bicycle repairs by our trained mechanics.Bike CollectionNeighborhood associations, Home Owners Associations, and gated communities can collect bikes in their neighborhood and arrangements can be made with Jack the Bike Man to have all the bikes at a specific location where the bikes can be picked up by a Jack the Bike Man volunteer. Some communities have matching grant programs for improving and beautifying the communities. All of the volunteer hours donated in collecting the bikes can go towards those grants. Other ways to help...There are many volunteer opportunities available; pick up bicycles, repair bicycles, office work, building maintenance, fund raising committee, event committee, Special outreach committee, board of directors, Program sponsorship, event sponsorship, working on youth programs, teach repair and maintenance of bicycles.Video produced by Road Holland when Jack The Bike Man was at a smaller location.",9.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>The history of the St. Monica School Breakfast Program can be summed up in the words of little Madeline, <i>“We love our bread, we love our butter, but most of all, we love each other”</i>.   The beauty of the breakfast program comes in many forms, and in the foreground are the children.  It starts by allowing students to begin the day with a full belly, allowing them to focus on learning.  It allows students to enjoy a meal with their friends and peers.  It allows parents and neighbours to participate in the community as they serve breakfast to the children.  There is no stigmatization of children who need this program because the program charmingly welcomes all students.    </p>
<p>The Breakfast Club was initiated ten years ago by Ms. Avice Joseph upon her retirement as a teacher at St. Monica.  And so the St. Monica breakfast program was born through the tenacity and leadership of a retired teacher and the generous support from school breakfast organizations such as Share the Warmth.   The Breakfast Program has a meager budget and the bulk of the food comes from well-established organizations.  Now and then, the school would acquire a bag of fruit donated by a parent or a local grocer and extra bagels from someone working at a bread factory.  To complete the program, Ms. Joseph has had to be resourceful.</p>

<h3>The New Cooking Classroom</h3> <p></p>
<p><b>At St. Monica, we have the bread and butter, and we have each other.  Now what we need most of all, are community partners.  We invite you to help us realize a dream facility to better host our enduring and endearing Breakfast Program. </b>We are asking for your financial support to purchase and install a counter, double-sink, ovens, refrigerators, dishwasher, cupboards, lighting, tables, chairs, computer station, couches, compost center and wall decal.  The complete vision of our new Cooking Classroom is detailed in the following 'St. Monica School Cooking Classroom Dream Plan' and Concept Board.</p>
<p>Our hope is to have an adequate and inviting place where volunteers can serve breakfast to students of St. Monica.  In addition, this room would host culinary workshops and lessons provided by staff during school.  Students and parents can attend after-school culinary classes and experience diverse foods by teachers from our very own multi-ethnic, multi-linguist, multi-generational community!  We can use the fresh organic produce from our very own 200 meter-squared vegetable garden located in front of the school.  The cornucopia of benefits for this new facility is abundant.</p>

<p>In March 2014, the NDG Food Depot held a community symposium on food security.  In contrast to our neighbourhood of abundance, they highlighted and sought out solutions to the food deserts in our community where fresh foods are difficult to come across due to physical barriers and/or socio-economic barriers.   Our students come from families living in these food deserts of Westhaven Village, Walkley, Benny Farm and St. Raymond’s Parish.  A direct and efficient solution to healthier eating and food security is through educating our children.  A cooking classroom would allow children to discover the joy and love of fresh foods and to be mindful of their health.  We can give our children a chance to learn and bring awareness to themselves and change the grocery choices of their parents!  </p>
<p>Our students would be over-joyed to have the chance to cook and learn hands-on ways in which to prepare nutritious meals.  The teachers would have better tools to teach and engage their students.  The Breakfast Program students and volunteers would spend their mornings in a beautiful and hopeful environment.</p>
<p><i><b>Good things are happening at St. Monica... have you seen our school lately!? </b></i>We have successfully implemented numerous changes, an awesome playground in the junior yard, $48,000 grant from the !ndigo Love of Reading Foundation, 200 square-foot organic garden, &amp; indoor plant growing stations to name just a few...</p>

Our students would be over-joyed to have the chance to cook and learn hands-on ways in which to prepare nutritious meals.  The teachers would have better tools to teach and engage their students.  The Breakfast Program students and volunteers would spend their mornings in a beautiful and hopeful environment.
Good things are happening at St. Monica... have you seen our school lately!? We have successfully implemented numerous changes, an awesome playground in the junior yard, $48,000 grant from the !ndigo Love of Reading Foundation, 200 square-foot organic garden, & indoor plant growing stations to name just a few...
   Risks & Challenges Your support now is critical to start-up the construction.  Our project will be completed in two phases.  After reaching the first half of our fundraising goals, we will commence construction, putting in place the essentials such as counters and appliances needed in order for the cooking classroom to be used immediately for the students of St. Monica. 
The first part of construction is set for summer 2016 which includes renovations to bring plumbing and ventilation up to code for appliances, purchase and installation of cabinets, sink, oven & fridge, table & chairs.  As more funding is secured, we will build the next stages, island counter, second oven, more cabinets along second wall.

<i>About me (Summary)</i><br/>
</h1><p></p><p><b>Hi, my name is Kenneth Realpe. I am 18 years old. I live in the house of my grandfathers with my mother Helena and my brother Steven,since 5 years ago I had studied Film´s Writting in format standard and Visual effects,thanks of this i have gotten half of  <a href=""http://kennethrealpe.wordpress.com/scholarship-vfs-canada/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">scholarship</a> from <i><a href=""http://vfs.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vancouver Film School </a></i>(VFS) in Canada.</b></p><p>since I have memory my mother always had been worried for my education and my brother education,my mom and my father are separated since i was a child,My brother has a delayed mild brain, so he will be part of my responsibility in a future and also my mom too .</p><div>
<div>From an early age I had liked the art, films and the way in which writers express their experiences through of their screenplays.
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p>I had started in the of the 3D world when I was 14 years old. One day my uncle showed me a program called Blender,in this software,he develops his advices and structures. I liked it a lot because of the color on the 3D models. I could develop my first 3D object,I developed a ball, then I had started to study the whole program and it conceptual parameters.</div>
<div>
<p></p>At the age of 15 i discovered my other passion: to write films scripts. This came to me due to a school paper I did when I was studying in high school. My teachers were prepared to evaluate my skills at writing so I spent all a night trying to imagine a story, and i showed my writting to the teachers  and they liked a lot, so they motivated me to go on writing.</div>
<div>
<p></p> When I was 16 I had to split my time between high school,the study scripts of film and the softwares of visual effects as ¨blender¨,autodesk 3D Studio max,boujou,photoshop,It was harder to me study film scripts because I had to study the standard Hollywood format. On the other hand, the visual effects study was not so complicated to me because I had already been studying and practicing it for two years.</div>
<div>
<p></p>Now I am 18, one day some months ago,I was watching ads from internet about a scholarship for students who were related to cinematic art. So I sent my portfolio to VFS with some of my works such as scripts short and renders. They contacted me at email,telling me to I was elected for a scholarship,I had to Postponing it until 2015 because of my early age and the lack of money to the tuition of vfs University.</div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p>I have increased my skills of art from my great grandfather. He was a Painter and a poet and as well as my mother. She is a sculptress of art classic.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p>a couple months ago a VFS representative called to my house,I told her about my truth. I told her I had not enought money to go to Vancouver; I did not have the enought money for tuition of the scholarship. She give  me  the opportunity to postpone the scholarship until 2015.</div>
<div>
<div><p>If I don't reach my entire goal, the money will still go toward my tuition universitary,Either way,I will fight until raise the money!!!!</p></div>

<p>desde que tengo memoria de mi madre siempre a luchado por mi educación y la de mi hermano, mi padre y ella se separaron, Mi hermano tiene un leve retraso cerebral, por lo que será parte de mi responsabilidad en un futuro y también mi mamá.</p>
<p>Desde muy temprana edad me ha gustado el arte, el cine y la manera en que los escritores expresan sus experiencias a través de sus guiones.</p>
<p>Empecé en el mundo del 3D cuando tenía 14 años de edad. Un día, mi tío me mostró un programa llamado Blender, en este software, desarrolla sus anuncios y estructuras. Me gustó mucho por el color en los modelos 3D. Pude desarrollar mi primer objeto 3D, desarrollé una pelota, luego empecé a estudiar todo el programa y sus parámetros conceptuales.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""><b></b></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>A la edad de 15 descubrí mi otra pasión: escribir guiones de cine. Este vino a mí debido a un periódico de la escuela que hice cuando estudiaba la secundaria. Mis maestros fueron a evaluar mis habilidades en la escritura así que pasé toda la noche tratando de imaginar una historia, a los profesores les gustó mucho, así que me motivaron a seguir escribiendo.</p>
<p>Cuando tenía 16 años tuve que dividir mi tiempo entre la escuela secundaria, los guiones de estudio de cine y los programas de efectos visuales como blender, Autodesk 3D Studio Max, boujou, photoshop, que era más difícil para mí para estudiar guiones de cine porque tenía que estudiar el formato estándar de Hollywood. Por otro lado, el estudio de efectos visuales no era tan complicado para mí, porque yo ya había estado estudiando y practicando durante tres años.</p>
<p>Ahora tengo 18, un día, hace algunos meses, estaba viendo los anuncios de la Internet acerca de una beca para los estudiantes que estaban relacionados con el arte cinematográfico. Así que envié mi portafolio para VFS con algunos de mis trabajos como guiones cortos y renders. Ellos me contactaron por correo electrónico, diciendo que fui elegido para la beca, tuve que posponerlo hasta el 2015 debido a mi edad temprana y la falta de dinero para pagar la matrícula de la universidad de VFS.</p>
<p>Heredé mis habilidades de arte de mi bisabuelo. Él era un pintor y poeta y también mi madre. Ella es una escultora de arte clásico.</p>
<p>Hace meses un representante de VFS llamó a mi casa, hablé con ella sobre mi verdad. Le dije que no tenía el dinero para ir a Vancouver; Yo no tengo todo el dinero para la matrícula de la beca. Ella me aconsejó posponer la beca.</p>
<p>Si no llego a toda mi meta, el dinero todavía se destinará a mi matrícula universitaria,cualquier manera, voy a luchar hasta conseguir el dinero !!!!</p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">Mi meta:</b><br/></p>

Hi, my name is Kenneth Realpe. I am 18 years old. I live in the house of my grandfathers with my mother Helena and my brother Steven,since 5 years ago I had studied Film´s Writting in format standard and Visual effects,thanks of this i have gotten half of  scholarship from Vancouver Film School (VFS) in Canada.since I have memory my mother always had been worried for my education and my brother education,my mom and my father are separated since i was a child,My brother has a delayed mild brain, so he will be part of my responsibility in a future and also my mom too .
From an early age I had liked the art, films and the way in which writers express their experiences through of their screenplays.
I had started in the of the 3D world when I was 14 years old. One day my uncle showed me a program called Blender,in this software,he develops his advices and structures. I liked it a lot because of the color on the 3D models. I could develop my first 3D object,I developed a ball, then I had started to study the whole program and it conceptual parameters.

At the age of 15 i discovered my other passion: to write films scripts. This came to me due to a school paper I did when I was studying in high school. My teachers were prepared to evaluate my skills at writing so I spent all a night trying to imagine a story, and i showed my writting to the teachers  and they liked a lot, so they motivated me to go on writing.

 When I was 16 I had to split my time between high school,the study scripts of film and the softwares of visual effects as ¨blender¨,autodesk 3D Studio max,boujou,photoshop,It was harder to me study film scripts because I had to study the standard Hollywood format. On the other hand, the visual effects study was not so complicated to me because I had already been studying and practicing it for two years.

Now I am 18, one day some months ago,I was watching ads from internet about a scholarship for students who were related to cinematic art. So I sent my portfolio to VFS with some of my works such as scripts short and renders. They contacted me at email,telling me to I was elected for a scholarship,I had to Postponing it until 2015 because of my early age and the lack of money to the tuition of vfs University.


I have increased my skills of art from my great grandfather. He was a Painter and a poet and as well as my mother. She is a sculptress of art classic.
a couple months ago a VFS representative called to my house,I told her about my truth. I told her I had not enought money to go to Vancouver; I did not have the enought money for tuition of the scholarship. She give  me  the opportunity to postpone the scholarship until 2015.

If I don't reach my entire goal, the money will still go toward my tuition universitary,Either way,I will fight until raise the money!!!!

My Goal:




Get to 32,000 USD and pay up my matriculation in the university of vancouver film school.


Study and graduate in vancouver film school.


travel to California,Los Ángeles where I can promote and commercialize my screenplays to studies as for example :Warner Brothers, Dreamworks,MGM,Amazon Studios,Paramount.


help to others people in this website too .


In Spanish:
Hola, mi
nombre es kenneth realpe tengo 18 años recientemente, vivo en casa de mis abuelos y desde hace 5 años me dedicado a estudiar efectos
visuales y escritura cinematográfica,gracias a esto logre conseguir media beca
en Vancouver Film School  (VFS)


desde que tengo memoria de mi madre siempre a luchado por mi educación y la de mi hermano, mi padre y ella se separaron, Mi hermano tiene un leve retraso cerebral, por lo que será parte de mi responsabilidad en un futuro y también mi mamá.
Desde muy temprana edad me ha gustado el arte, el cine y la manera en que los escritores expresan sus experiencias a través de sus guiones.
Empecé en el mundo del 3D cuando tenía 14 años de edad. Un día, mi tío me mostró un programa llamado Blender, en este software, desarrolla sus anuncios y estructuras. Me gustó mucho por el color en los modelos 3D. Pude desarrollar mi primer objeto 3D, desarrollé una pelota, luego empecé a estudiar todo el programa y sus parámetros conceptuales.



A la edad de 15 descubrí mi otra pasión: escribir guiones de cine. Este vino a mí debido a un periódico de la escuela que hice cuando estudiaba la secundaria. Mis maestros fueron a evaluar mis habilidades en la escritura así que pasé toda la noche tratando de imaginar una historia, a los profesores les gustó mucho, así que me motivaron a seguir escribiendo.
Cuando tenía 16 años tuve que dividir mi tiempo entre la escuela secundaria, los guiones de estudio de cine y los programas de efectos visuales como blender, Autodesk 3D Studio Max, boujou, photoshop, que era más difícil para mí para estudiar guiones de cine porque tenía que estudiar el formato estándar de Hollywood. Por otro lado, el estudio de efectos visuales no era tan complicado para mí, porque yo ya había estado estudiando y practicando durante tres años.
Ahora tengo 18, un día, hace algunos meses, estaba viendo los anuncios de la Internet acerca de una beca para los estudiantes que estaban relacionados con el arte cinematográfico. Así que envié mi portafolio para VFS con algunos de mis trabajos como guiones cortos y renders. Ellos me contactaron por correo electrónico, diciendo que fui elegido para la beca, tuve que posponerlo hasta el 2015 debido a mi edad temprana y la falta de dinero para pagar la matrícula de la universidad de VFS.
Heredé mis habilidades de arte de mi bisabuelo. Él era un pintor y poeta y también mi madre. Ella es una escultora de arte clásico.
Hace meses un representante de VFS llamó a mi casa, hablé con ella sobre mi verdad. Le dije que no tenía el dinero para ir a Vancouver; Yo no tengo todo el dinero para la matrícula de la beca. Ella me aconsejó posponer la beca.
Si no llego a toda mi meta, el dinero todavía se destinará a mi matrícula universitaria,cualquier manera, voy a luchar hasta conseguir el dinero !!!!
Mi meta:


Llegar a los 32,000 USD y pagar mi matricula en la universidad del VFS
Estudiar Durante 4 años en vancouver film school
Viajar luego a California,Los angeles donde puedo promover y comercializar guiones a estudios como por ejemplo: Warner Brothers,Dreamworks,MGM,Amazon Studios,Paramount.

<p><b><b>NativeEye 2016:
The Presidential Race through the Lens of Native America</b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Overview<br/></b></p>
<p>Covering
stories about the 2016 presidential race is the focus for college students
accepted into the 2015-2016 class of the Native American Journalism Fellowship
(NAJF). <br/></p>
<p>This groundbreaking project combines mentoring, training, hands-on
experience in multimedia reporting, and online coursework through the
University of Montana School of Journalism. <br/></p>
<p>NativeEye 2016 is administered by
the Native American Journalists Association (NAJA), and is made possible through
partnerships with the University of Montana and the Newseum Institute. Although
most of the one-year project will be conducted through online and digital
communication, a crucial component of the yearlong project involves hands-on
training through an on-site newsroom immersion experience during the week of NAJA’s annual National Native Media Conference, held this
year in the Washington D.C.-area in July. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<p><b>Need for funding</b></p>
<p>NAJA
needs to raise $15,000 to provide 10 college students with travel, lodging,
food, onsite transportation to cover stories, and other expenses related to
their educational training. <br/></p>
<p>This funding would not only cover their
expenses from Sunday, July 5 through Saturday, July 11, but would also provide the necessary tools (and, hopefully, the confidence) they need to
cover critical political stories.</p>
</div> <div> <h3></h3>
<p><b>Project goals <br/></b></p>
<p>A new cohort of young Native American journalists
will gain experience in covering national elections while leveraging digital
technology, which will give these fellows an edge when they enter the
workforce. In addition, through the coverage offered through NativeEye 2016, Native
American voters will be engaged and informed about the presidential candidates
and will learn how the candidates’ proposed policies might impact them and
their communities. </p>
</div>
<p><b>How
NativeEye 2016 works</b></p>
<p>NativeEye
2016 is a project that brings together college students and experienced
journalists to create content about the 2016 presidential race. The stories
will be published on a web portal beginning in the fall of 2015. The portal is
being designed not only to inform voters about issues important to Native
Americans, but also to provide voters with information about how each
presidential candidate’s proposed policies and platform would affect American
Indian and Alaska Native communities across the country. <br/></p><p>NAJA envisions that
the NativeEye web portal would be a destination website
for voters to interact with each other through chats, as well as a place for
them to view videos and other multimedia content about the presidential race. <br/></p><p>The 10 Native American college students will produce their work through an upper-level
online journalism course offered by the University of Montana, where they will gain three hours of college credit toward a degree. <br/></p><p>Students will be matched with mentors – professional journalists with experience in covering
elections – who help guide the fellows in their stories about the presidential
race.</p><p></p><p>
</p><p><b>Support diversity in civic engagement<br/></b></p>

The United States continues to grow more racially and ethnically
diverse, yet the way presidential candidates speak to voters has
changed little since its birth as a nation. To those seeking the highest
office, the main audience is white America. <br/><p></p><p>Mainstream media cover presidential
races largely through that same lens, even though the electorate increasingly
is becoming more diverse. The U.S. Census Bureau reported that over the last
five presidential elections, the share of voters who were racial or ethnic
minorities rose from just over one in six in 1996 to more than one in four in
2012. <br/></p><p>Native Americans and their issues are rarely part of the national
discussion during a presidential race, yet in the 2008 election, several states
were impacted with the increased participation of Native voters. The continued
lack of attention to this segment of the population underscores the need for a
place for Native American voters to access information about the presidential
candidates – through the lens of their own tribal issues – so they may make an
informed choice on Election Day. </p><p>
</p><p><b>Goals of the Native American Journalism Fellowship (NAJF)</b></p><p>- Create 
rich experience for
Native American students that inspires them to pursue a career in journalism <br/></p><p>- Offer training that prepares students for the newsroom</p><p>- Prepare participants for job offers (program graduates)</p><p>- Execute a successful project that turns into a model for an ongoing program<br/></p><p>- Produce active NAJA professional members who

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Cartoon Guy Show is an educational
 art show for children Kindergarten through 5th grade.  In the show we 
teach our students how to create and design their own cartoons and works
 of art using Language Arts, Math, History, Science and much more.  We 
teach using a method we like to  call ""Laugh-a-cation"" which means to 
educate through laughter.  The show's lessons are based off of state 
educational standards.  We believe that our students can get a better 
grasp on their other subjects in school by using art.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ever since Justin Barnes was a child he has had a fascination with cartoons and
 movies. In high school he had the opportunity to work with a very 
talented artist, Gary Barker at Paws Inc. where Garfield the cat is 
created. Through Mr. Barker, Justin learned several new techniques in 
art. Shortly after high school, Justin taught his first, ""How to Create 
Your Own Cartoons!"" workshop at the Greenwood Public Library. That right
 there was all he needed to know what he wanted to do with the rest of 
his life. Shortly after that in 2002, he created his own company called 
Cartoon Express, which taught many children around surrounding states. 
Since then he has taught over 10,000 children how to create and design 
their own cartoons, comics and much more. While teaching the students 
the dubbed him a nick name that would stick with him the rest of his 
life, ""The Cartoon Guy!""</li>

<p><b>-&gt; WHY IS MENTAL HEALTH IN ARMED VIOLENCE SUCH A BIG ISSUE?</b></p>
<p>Mental health problems
are a leading cause of disability globally. They account for 13% of the world’s
total burden of diseases. They affect 10% of people across the course of their
lives, and make up over a quarter of the years lived by people in disability
globally. Almost three-quarters of people with mental health problems, and
suffering from depression, substance addiction, schizophrenia, learning
disabilities, PTSD and other common mental conditions, live in low- and
middle-income countries. Every year, $2.5 trillion are lost to mental health
problems. Ironically, the amount invested to address the issue is only less
than 2% of the health spending in most low- and lower middle-income countries.</p>
<p>Mental health problems
are caused by a number of factors, including exposure to armed violence. While
there is universal consensus on the harmful effects of armed violence on life
and property, its impact on mental health has largely been ignored, even in the
face of overwhelming evidence of the causal link between the two. Despite
strong economic, social, humanitarian and epidemiological arguments for
tackling mental health as a consequence of armed conflict, the condition
remains disproportionately poorly funded around the world. Unaddressed, mental
health poses a massive development problem and will become a greater barrier to
the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).</p>

and Armed Violence</b><br/></p>
<p>Pakistan has had a long
history of conflict that has displaced people, exposed them to violence and
triggered mental health problems. Since 2001, over 55,000 people have been
killed, hundreds of thousands injured, and more than 3 million displaced by
armed hostilities between militants and Pakistani forces. This is the largest of
such displacement since the partition of 1947. Ethnic and political conflicts
have also contributed to further insecurity, morbidity and destruction.</p>
<p>Armed violence is the
fourth leading cause of mortality among 15 to 44-year-olds. It causes
significant psychological and emotional suffering for survivors and their
families. It undermines their mental health and well-being. Rates of depression
and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are evidently higher in
conflict-affected countries. As a poor country with over 180 million people and
a massive mental health burden associated with decades of armed violence;
Pakistan allocates only 0.40% of its health budget to mental health. Given the
numerous problems the country is facing, mental health is not a top priority.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">For many survivors,
escaping hostilities is often just the beginning of a long struggle to: make

economic recovery.</span></p>

</div>","On the 16th of December 2014, the Pakistani Taliban
attacked a school in the city of Peshawar, killing 141 people. The majority of these were children but the school's principal and teachers were also amongst those dead. Over
100 people were also injured during what is considered as the Taliban's deadliest attack in Pakistan.


Pakistan is a country already struggling to cope with armed violence
and poverty; amongst other problems (see figures below). This unforgivable act has caused further deaths, injuries and emotional trauma.




ACTION ON ARMED VIOLENCE (AOAV) strongly condemns this
horrible act:
We believe that there is no justification for such actions. We are
also urging relevant agencies to provide treatment and care for the injured. The
families of the dead clearly need support – often psychological in nature, but financial
too – at such a painful time.

<p>1. Smell Open Lab:</p>
<p>Berlin is a major expression of freedom and creativity in Europe. Many artists and creative professionals move to the crazy metropolis every year.

<p>2. Help our library of scents to grow:</p>
<p>The Smell Lab has already a collection of about 120 perfumery ingredients (essential oils, aroma molecules, and fragrance oils) at your disposition. However, we need a wider variety of ingredients, I want to provide you with the largest possible choice you've ever imagined!

Credere nella realizzazione degli individui come valore fondante di una società significa considerare il benessere degli altri come una parte fondamentale della propria realizzazione. Nessun individuo può sentirsi realmente realizzato se non prova piacere a migliorare la comunità di cui fa parte.</span></p><p><b>QUINDI È UN PROGETTO POLITICO?</b> Sì, ma senza limitazioni di partito o schieramenti tradizionali. </p>
<p><b>QUALI SONO I PROGETTI
DI MILANO CITTÀ STATO.</b></p>
<p>Tra i progetti prioritari di Milano città stato ci sono:</p>
<p><b>#1. Milano free zone</b></p>
<p>Le “zone economiche speciali” si stanno
diffondendo in tutto il mondo: sono circa 3mila sparse in 135 Paesi. La
caratteristica delle free zone è di avere proprie <b>leggi fiscali, societarie e del lavoro, con una burocrazia semplificata</b>.
Nelle free zone più che sulle tasse si paga un prezzo annuale di permesso per
operare. Questo semplifica la gestione amministrativa di ogni attività e
consente di concentrarsi interamente sul proprio business. Si può immaginare
inizialmente di applicare il modello di free zone per ogni nuova azienda che
nasce o che arriva sul territorio, <b>con
burocrazia agevolata (possibilità di fondarla in 10 minuti), con un pagamento
fisso che sostituisce ogni imposta, per un periodo di almeno tre anni.</b> Se
la sperimentazione sulle nuove aziende mostra vantaggi economici e fiscali
anche per l’amministrazione, si procederà all’estensione di questo regime a
ogni operatore economico. </p>
<p><b>#2. Feedback dei cittadini sulla pubblica amministrazione</b></p>
<p>La
tecnologia oggi consente di poter esprimere il giudizio in tempo reale su ogni
servizio fornito. Oggi si possono esprimere giudizi su tutto: sugli alberghi,
sui ristoranti, sui professionisti e perfino sugli amici. Su tutto, tranne che
sull’unica cosa che tutti noi paghiamo: la pubblica amministrazione. </p>
<p>Ogni
cittadino deve avere la possibilità di esprimere il proprio feedback su ogni
servizio fornito dall’amministrazione. Dal sindaco e gli assessori fino a
scendere a chi fornisce attività allo sportello, <b>tutti devono poter essere oggetto di valutazione da parte del cittadino</b>,
perché lui è chi li paga e perché è suo il patrimonio che loro amministrano. </p>
<p>Fine
non è punire chi lavora male ma mettere in luce chi dà soddisfazione ai
cittadini e fornire un apprezzamento o dei consigli utili per rendere più
efficiente il suo lavoro. </p>
<p><b>#3. Milano capitale mondiale nella produzione di nuova cultura</b></p>
<p>In
un Paese che si limita, con fatica, a conservare la cultura del passato, <b>Milano dovrebbe porsi come capitale nella
produzione di nuova cultura</b>, tornando all’altezza della sua grande storia. </p>
<p>Per
farlo bisognerebbe mettere in rete i centri che favoriscono la produzione di
cultura, si dovrebbe far emergere talenti e metterli in condizione di poter
trasmettere le loro opere al pubblico. Si dovrebbero mettere in rete filantropi
e investitori del settore <b>per agevolare
la messa in luce di chi ha le carte per affermarsi su mercati più ampi</b>,
bisogna rafforzare laboratori, botteghe e centri di formazione. </p>
<p>Bisogna
coinvolgere le imprese e una volta creata questa rete di formazione,
comunicazione e collaborazione, <b>si deve
cercare di far venire a Milano artisti di altre città, italiane e straniere,
per alimentare la produzione locale. </b></p>
<p><b>#4.
Istruzione acceleratore dell’individuo</b></p>
<p><b>Il
percorso di istruzione dovrà avere lo scopo di favorire creatività e
consapevolezza degli studenti nelle loro capacità distintive.</b> Piuttosto che
produrre laureati specializzati in un apprendimento passivo di poche materie,
si dovrà cercare di avere persone capaci, con una personalità sviluppata a 360
gradi. </p>
<p>La personalità dovrà essere ricca di
esperienze e dovrà anche essere completata riprendendo una grande tradizione
italiana che è stata una delle chiavi del successo del periodo rinascimentale:
l’arte manuale. </p>
<p><b>Durante
gli studi ci sarà un anno di sperimentazione</b> in cui ogni studente proverà
tanti tipi di lavori di ogni tipo per mettere in luce le sue capacità e per
capire a cosa è più orientato, a fianco all'apprendimento passivo ci sarà
grande spazio all'elaborazione di idee e progetti propri. </p>
<p>Si darà completezza alla formazione in
ogni ambito della personalità, <b>si
stimolerà lo studente a essere protagonista in società</b>, soggetto di
contributo attivo alla comunità e ogni studente potrà scegliere liberamente il
suo percorso. </p>
<p>In tutti i corsi di studi si cercherà
di allenare lo studente come <i>homo
economicus</i>, ossia come soggetto capace e predisposto a produrre più
ricchezza di quella che consuma, e <b>deve
essere fortemente incentivata la sperimentazione di attività in proprio</b>, ad
esempio predisponendo una zona franca, tipo i primi 3 anni post laurea, in cui
eventuali fallimenti non produrranno effetti sul curriculum della
persona. </p>
<p>Tre anni dopo la laurea significa
estendere il periodo della formazione dell’individuo oltre il termine dei suoi
studi. Anzi, a Milano città stato ci sarà <b>un
sistema di formazione permanente disponibile per tutti i cittadini</b> e che
renderà più ricco il percorso di carriera di ognuno. In particolare il sistema
di formazione permanente entrerà in azione per aiutare chi è in difficoltà a
stare sul mercato. </p>
<p><b>#5. Dal Welfare
al Restart</b></p>
<p>Il concetto di restart mette al centro
la persona con il fine di <b>aiutarla a
fare emergere le sue potenzialità e a riportarla sulla strada dell’autonomia</b>,
intesa come capacità di provvedere a se stessa. </p>
<p>Il restart si applica a chi ha perso il
lavoro, a persone in difficoltà economica e si estende anche a chi è fallito o
ha dovuto chiudere partita iva o azienda, trattando imprenditori e liberi
professionisti allo stesso modo di lavoratori che perdono il lavoro: <b>a Milano città Stato si tutela la persona
non il posto di lavoro</b>.</p>
<p><b>#6.
Milano città leader nella lotta contro l’inquinamento</b></p>
<p>Milano
è una delle città più inquinate d’Europa. Invece di subire passivamente il
problema cercando unicamente di ridurre l’emissione di agenti inquinanti,
Milano deve diventare la città d’avanguardia nella eliminazione
dell’inquinamento. </p>
<p>La soluzione potrebbe essere quella di
trovare sul territorio start up, aziende, ricercatori, investitori più
coinvolti con la sezione della green economy più legata al tema dell’inquinamento,
dopo di che dovrebbe metterli assieme, <b>creare
alleanze con le altre città per ricevere da loro le migliori intelligenze e
competenze interessate all’inquinamento atmosferico</b>, che sarebbero
interessati a venire a Milano perché a Milano esiste il massimo problema e la
maggiore attenzione per cercare di risolverlo. </p>
<p>L’inquinamento
stesso può diventare fattore di attrazione di un sistema in grado di far
diventare Milano una capitale mondiale e, una volta creato questo sistema, si
può generare un indotto fatto di ricchezza, di lavoro, di talenti che
proliferano sul territorio. Realizzando un circolo virtuoso che possa
consolidare questa leadership. </p>
<p><b>#7. La prima
città universale</b></p>
<p>Milano
città stato non è la città dove hai la residenza ma è la comunità a cui
contribuisci. Milano città stato aprirà la sua cittadinanza a tutte le persone
che contribuiranno in misura significativa alla costruzione della città ideale.
Questo si può fare perché si ha la separazione dell’amministrazione, intesa
come erogazione di servizi, dalla politica della città. <b>Chi fa qualcosa di concreto per la città, diventa cittadino universale
di Milano godendo di alcuni dei diritti di cittadinanza anche se vive in luoghi
distanti nel mondo.</b></p><br/><p><b>CONDIVIDI LA CAMPAGNA SUI

VERSIONE ITALIANA

L'OBIETTIVO DEL CROWDFUNDING?L'articolo 132 della Costituzione Italiana consente
la creazione di una autonomia per Milano. Milano città stato mira a diventare la prima città d'Italia autonoma, modello di efficienza e cultura di vita, come già sono Berlino, Madrid, Amburgo, i cantoni svizzeri, Singapore e Hong Kong, esempio di come una città stato possa essere da stimolo per la nazione di cui fa parte.
Fine di questa campagna è di promuovere un
sondaggio sui cittadini e raccogliere firme per arrivare a un referendum per fare scegliere se dire SI o dire NO a Milano Città Stato.Leggi il manifesto di Milano Città Stato: http://www.milanocittastato.it/manifesto/CHI SIAMO? Milano città stato è un progetto trasversale alla politica che ha l'obiettivo di coinvolgere i cittadini nella costruzione della città ideale.È un progetto concepito in Vivaio, associazione che ha lo scopo di rendere Milano grande nel mondo.

SPAGNOLO

metropoli europee, anche attraverso il conseguimento di una sua maggiore
autonomia dal governo centraleDI COSA ABBIAMO BISOGNO PERLA CAMPAGNA DI MILANO CITTÀ STATO?Tutti i contributi raccolti verranno destinati alla campagna di comunicazione di Milano Città Stato e il loro impiego sarà pubblicato sul sito www.milanocittastato.itIn particolare si prevedono le seguenti attività:Se si raggiungeranno da 15.000 euro a 100.000 euro si attiveranno iniziative di comunicazione e pubblicitarie per promuovere e diffondere il progetto di Milano Città Stato, tra cui il potenziamento del sito www.milanocittastato.it.Se si raggiungeranno 100.000 euro si organizzeranno le MILANARIE con 25 banchetti durante le elezioni amministrative di Milano, per far votare i cittadini SI o NO a Milano Città StatoSe si raggiungeranno 200.000 euro, nelle MILANARIE verranno posti 50 banchetti e si realizzerà una campagna affissioni e una campagna media per promuovere l'eventoSe si raggiungeranno 300.000 euro, nelle MILANARIE verranno posti 75 banchetti e si realizzerà una campagna affissioni e una campagna media per promuovere l'evento Se si raggiungeranno 400.000 euro, nelle MILANARIE verranno posti 100 banchetti e si realizzerà una campagna affissioni e una campagna media per promuovere l'evento Il 50% di quanto raccolto sopra i 400.000 euro  verrà destinato a finanziare a fondo perduto progetti per Milano. L'altro 50% verrà utilizzato a supporto del progetto di Milano Città Stato. CHI SONO I CITTADINI DI MILANO CITTÀ STATO? Milano città stato è un modello di città universale ed è aperta a tutti quelli che vogliono il bene di Milano. Indipendentemente da dove si trovano.QUAL È IL SOGNO DI MILANO CITTÀ STATO? Dare la possibilità a ognuno di esprimersi secondo le sue inclinazioni, facendo al contempo crescere la comunità di cui fa parte. Credere nella realizzazione degli individui come valore fondante di una società significa considerare il benessere degli altri come una parte fondamentale della propria realizzazione. Nessun individuo può sentirsi realmente realizzato se non prova piacere a migliorare la comunità di cui fa parte.QUINDI È UN PROGETTO POLITICO? Sì, ma senza limitazioni di partito o schieramenti tradizionali. 
QUALI SONO I PROGETTI
DI MILANO CITTÀ STATO.
Tra i progetti prioritari di Milano città stato ci sono:
#1. Milano free zone
Le “zone economiche speciali” si stanno
diffondendo in tutto il mondo: sono circa 3mila sparse in 135 Paesi. La
caratteristica delle free zone è di avere proprie leggi fiscali, societarie e del lavoro, con una burocrazia semplificata.
Nelle free zone più che sulle tasse si paga un prezzo annuale di permesso per
operare. Questo semplifica la gestione amministrativa di ogni attività e
consente di concentrarsi interamente sul proprio business. Si può immaginare
inizialmente di applicare il modello di free zone per ogni nuova azienda che
nasce o che arriva sul territorio, con
burocrazia agevolata (possibilità di fondarla in 10 minuti), con un pagamento
fisso che sostituisce ogni imposta, per un periodo di almeno tre anni. Se
la sperimentazione sulle nuove aziende mostra vantaggi economici e fiscali
anche per l’amministrazione, si procederà all’estensione di questo regime a
ogni operatore economico. 
#2. Feedback dei cittadini sulla pubblica amministrazione
La
tecnologia oggi consente di poter esprimere il giudizio in tempo reale su ogni
servizio fornito. Oggi si possono esprimere giudizi su tutto: sugli alberghi,
sui ristoranti, sui professionisti e perfino sugli amici. Su tutto, tranne che
sull’unica cosa che tutti noi paghiamo: la pubblica amministrazione. 
Ogni
cittadino deve avere la possibilità di esprimere il proprio feedback su ogni
servizio fornito dall’amministrazione. Dal sindaco e gli assessori fino a
scendere a chi fornisce attività allo sportello, tutti devono poter essere oggetto di valutazione da parte del cittadino,
perché lui è chi li paga e perché è suo il patrimonio che loro amministrano. 
Fine
non è punire chi lavora male ma mettere in luce chi dà soddisfazione ai
cittadini e fornire un apprezzamento o dei consigli utili per rendere più
efficiente il suo lavoro. 
#3. Milano capitale mondiale nella produzione di nuova cultura
In
un Paese che si limita, con fatica, a conservare la cultura del passato, Milano dovrebbe porsi come capitale nella
produzione di nuova cultura, tornando all’altezza della sua grande storia. 
Per
farlo bisognerebbe mettere in rete i centri che favoriscono la produzione di
cultura, si dovrebbe far emergere talenti e metterli in condizione di poter
trasmettere le loro opere al pubblico. Si dovrebbero mettere in rete filantropi
e investitori del settore per agevolare
la messa in luce di chi ha le carte per affermarsi su mercati più ampi,
bisogna rafforzare laboratori, botteghe e centri di formazione. 
Bisogna
coinvolgere le imprese e una volta creata questa rete di formazione,
comunicazione e collaborazione, si deve
cercare di far venire a Milano artisti di altre città, italiane e straniere,
per alimentare la produzione locale. 
#4.
Istruzione acceleratore dell’individuo
Il
percorso di istruzione dovrà avere lo scopo di favorire creatività e
consapevolezza degli studenti nelle loro capacità distintive. Piuttosto che
produrre laureati specializzati in un apprendimento passivo di poche materie,
si dovrà cercare di avere persone capaci, con una personalità sviluppata a 360
gradi. 
La personalità dovrà essere ricca di
esperienze e dovrà anche essere completata riprendendo una grande tradizione
italiana che è stata una delle chiavi del successo del periodo rinascimentale:
l’arte manuale. 
Durante
gli studi ci sarà un anno di sperimentazione in cui ogni studente proverà
tanti tipi di lavori di ogni tipo per mettere in luce le sue capacità e per
capire a cosa è più orientato, a fianco all'apprendimento passivo ci sarà
grande spazio all'elaborazione di idee e progetti propri. 
Si darà completezza alla formazione in
ogni ambito della personalità, si
stimolerà lo studente a essere protagonista in società, soggetto di
contributo attivo alla comunità e ogni studente potrà scegliere liberamente il
suo percorso. 
In tutti i corsi di studi si cercherà
di allenare lo studente come homo
economicus, ossia come soggetto capace e predisposto a produrre più
ricchezza di quella che consuma, e deve
essere fortemente incentivata la sperimentazione di attività in proprio, ad
esempio predisponendo una zona franca, tipo i primi 3 anni post laurea, in cui
eventuali fallimenti non produrranno effetti sul curriculum della
persona. 
Tre anni dopo la laurea significa
estendere il periodo della formazione dell’individuo oltre il termine dei suoi
studi. Anzi, a Milano città stato ci sarà un
sistema di formazione permanente disponibile per tutti i cittadini e che
renderà più ricco il percorso di carriera di ognuno. In particolare il sistema
di formazione permanente entrerà in azione per aiutare chi è in difficoltà a
stare sul mercato. 
#5. Dal Welfare
al Restart
Il concetto di restart mette al centro
la persona con il fine di aiutarla a
fare emergere le sue potenzialità e a riportarla sulla strada dell’autonomia,
intesa come capacità di provvedere a se stessa. 
Il restart si applica a chi ha perso il
lavoro, a persone in difficoltà economica e si estende anche a chi è fallito o
ha dovuto chiudere partita iva o azienda, trattando imprenditori e liberi
professionisti allo stesso modo di lavoratori che perdono il lavoro: a Milano città Stato si tutela la persona
non il posto di lavoro.
#6.
Milano città leader nella lotta contro l’inquinamento
Milano
è una delle città più inquinate d’Europa. Invece di subire passivamente il
problema cercando unicamente di ridurre l’emissione di agenti inquinanti,
Milano deve diventare la città d’avanguardia nella eliminazione
dell’inquinamento. 
La soluzione potrebbe essere quella di
trovare sul territorio start up, aziende, ricercatori, investitori più
coinvolti con la sezione della green economy più legata al tema dell’inquinamento,
dopo di che dovrebbe metterli assieme, creare
alleanze con le altre città per ricevere da loro le migliori intelligenze e
competenze interessate all’inquinamento atmosferico, che sarebbero
interessati a venire a Milano perché a Milano esiste il massimo problema e la
maggiore attenzione per cercare di risolverlo. 
L’inquinamento
stesso può diventare fattore di attrazione di un sistema in grado di far
diventare Milano una capitale mondiale e, una volta creato questo sistema, si
può generare un indotto fatto di ricchezza, di lavoro, di talenti che
proliferano sul territorio. Realizzando un circolo virtuoso che possa
consolidare questa leadership. 
#7. La prima
città universale
Milano
città stato non è la città dove hai la residenza ma è la comunità a cui
contribuisci. Milano città stato aprirà la sua cittadinanza a tutte le persone
che contribuiranno in misura significativa alla costruzione della città ideale.
Questo si può fare perché si ha la separazione dell’amministrazione, intesa
come erogazione di servizi, dalla politica della città. Chi fa qualcosa di concreto per la città, diventa cittadino universale
di Milano godendo di alcuni dei diritti di cittadinanza anche se vive in luoghi
distanti nel mondo.CONDIVIDI LA CAMPAGNA SUI

  Where we are in Development
.Developed and launched the MVP for the web platform.
Upgrading and iterating on the user experience for the web platform
Completing Development of the Digital campus
Designing the User interface for the mobile application
 We will soon begin the process of:
Developing the mobile App for the  platform
Develop an admin dashboard for the Digital campus, to help school administrators understand and manage their student experiences.
Hiring student writers to create content covering all aspects of university life.
Create more pathways for linking students to the platform.
Our primary goal is to establish the platform as the go-to social network for students in universities within the U.S.A, Canada and the U.K. And in the long-run eventually grow our community globally.                              The timeline |- 21th of January 2019 - Launched the Peersview platform||- 26th of March 2019 - Beginning of  first round of crowd-funding.||- 6th of May 2019 - Launch Indiegogo InDemand campaign for crowd-funding||- 5th of June 2019 - Initial round of funding becomes available. Work, code and test. Constant communication and updates with supporters on progress, ideas for features and sneak-peeks.   Why we need your supportWe have been working on Peersview for 2 years and we've come a long way. But now we need your help. By contributing to this project, you help us embed knowledge sharing into higher education for good! Our campaign to raise $100,000 will allow Peersview to grow its community of students.Let's make our higher education communities closer and more connected. So why should you support us?
Peersview is the best exclusive social network for college and university students.
We are creating a global ecosystem for the next generation of students.
Our student community needs to continue growing; therefore we need funding to invest in targeted marketing. The larger the community becomes, the better the user experience Peersview can deliver.
We want to continue improving on our strengths in helping students collaborate and crowd-source information more efficiently. 
We provide the best communication and collaboration tools suitable for Distant leaning students.
We need to hire people within academia that can help with the quality of content on the platform.
We need to provide financial incentives to encourage contributions in the Peersview community.
If we do not reach the entire goal, the funds raised will still be used very efficiently towards marketing to grow our community.We are gaining momentum, in only 2 months after launch, and zero advertising budget we have been able to attract a significant userbase onto the platform.                        Risks & Challenges
The initial growth can be slow especially without adequate funding; as the size of the community would play a big role in the experience students would derive from our platform.
With heavy targeted marketing, we hope to maximize our growth in community size, in a shorter period of time. And the critical student mass necessary to make the platform attractive for companies to advertise. 
One major risk with online social platforms is bullying, we have adequate measures in place to ensure we have control over the languages used within the community.

Their creations are very important to help children deal with the post-operatory stress and increase the bond between children and significant adults” – Luca Silvia, Chief psychiatrist at the Neurology Hospital for Children in Sibiu“When the results are so visible, it is clearly that the emotional development program has been thoroughly conceived and implemented!” – Livia Caciuloiu-Minea, Psychologist""With their content and shows, the emotional and social learning is playful, created within very beautiful stories and metaphors, just as children learn best""  – Lakshmi Barbus, Psychotherapist Why this campaign matters to usMany children, parents, psychologists and even medical stuff told us they observed great improvements after experiencing our songs, live shows, apps, books, video or audio content. We were amazed when a child diagnosed with cancer and his mother told us our live show helped him walk faster and even learn to skate – “an incredible achievement after going through 6 brain surgeries​!” said the mother . Why your help is so importantPain management is very important for children and teensNot only that children get to smile a little bit, which is important,but it can make a difference in recovery and less side-effects from medication What We NeedWith the money we create and update the appsPay the psychologists and the testing with the childrenAnd work with 200 children so they can learn these amazingly important skills What You GetWe sprinkled our magic in unique perks we hope you’ll enjoy each month, starting with February 2019. Risks & ChallengesWe help children for over 6 years now, in the last year and a half we are doing it on our NGO.We spend lots of of time and money in this project, having a huge motivation.Results are better and better and we can help more and more children and teens each yearSo we believe the risks are very low - you can also see our lovely activity report on our website :) Other Ways You Can HelpIf you are interested in helping out in other ways, you can:

<h3>Why Seneca Treehouse?</h3>
<p>It can be challenging to see <strong>how we can</strong> <strong>fix the world's problems</strong>, and it can be even more challenging to <strong>implement the solutions</strong> <strong>on a large scale</strong>. </p>
<p><i>""<strong>The Seneca Treehouse is a launch pad""</strong></i>,  stated JP, a previous student resident at the project. </p>
<p>We take in people who have <strong>passion and perseverance</strong> to be <b>game changers</b> in their communities and equip them with the tools &amp; techniques to do so.  </p>
<p><strong>We</strong> <strong>provide housing, paid internships, and training</strong> focused on a whole systems approach to sustainable development.  </p>
<p><strong><u>2019 Curriculum </u>&amp; Some of THE PERKS!</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Permaculture design certification </li>
<li>Construction training: carpentry, lumber milling, welding, metal working, plumbing, electrical, natural building, renewable energy, passive solar design, etc</li>
<li>Family summer camp: foraging, fire making, natural building, baking, milling, animal husbandry &amp; more</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Once Seneca Treehouse Is Complete, we will focus on unfolding the one year curriculum for Treehouse Trade School </strong>including classes like Clothing Creation, Manifest Your Dreams, and Using Tech to undo the Wreck.   </p>
<p><strong>OK so WHY airbnb? </strong></p>
<p><i>There once was a gal named Carly who lived in the house in the tree. </i></p>
<p><i>She loved that tree house dearly, and put it on airbnb!</i></p>
<p>We had the pleasure of living with Carly Basinger while she studied at Clemson University.  Carly lived in the Treehouse for 3 years, and had a brilliant idea to put it on airbnb.  We didn't realize the potential until about 3 years later.  Airbnb is a great opportunity for income AND introducing sustainability to folks who are on vacation and usually in an open state of mind.  This is also a great opportunity for people to stay here and experience sustainable <strong>living in comfort </strong>without jumping right into an internship or a class.  During a training course, we block off the rooms and make them available for students. </p>
<p>Carly is now in Cape Vincent NY, and manages Riverside Farm, her family business.  </p>
<h3><strong>About the founder: Scott Allen Bunn</strong></h3>
<p>I have been  building houses since I was 11 years old. While attending Clemson University, I started my own fabrication business. My story <strong>really begins</strong> after I built my own house with some friends during my senior year. We built with a plan to sell the home two years later!  </p>
<p><strong>2 years later - The</strong> <strong>2008 Economic Crash </strong></p>
<p><strong>This was my wake up call</strong>... I began learning about the economy, with the intention to create resilience in case it happened again. What I learned was <strong>alarming</strong>, and<strong> disturbing</strong>. I spent about a year ANGRY, before I started to see the solutions. Now, after studying permaculture and 10 years of community development experience, <u><i><strong>I see solutions everywhere!  </strong></i></u></p>
<p>In 2010, I began turning my home into the Seneca Treehouse Project. As the earlier Mentioned Launchpad, STP has led to the creation of <strong>Treehouse Internatural Inc,</strong> a <u>Benefit Corporation</u> with a mission to<i> <strong>help each other live in harmony with the planet.  </strong></i></p>
<p><strong>Treehouse Internatural Inc is made up of 3 smaller companies. </strong></p>
<p><i>1. Seneca Treehouse Project, llc</i></p>
<p><i>2. Amity Builders, llc</i></p>
<p><i>3. Treehouse Tools &amp; Training, llc (DBA -Treehouse Trade School)</i></p>
<h3><strong>Use of Funding - $5000 goal</strong></h3>
<p>The funds will be used, in part, as a base to <strong>secure financing</strong> for the remaining construction, AND build the <strong>actual foundation</strong> for the community center at the Seneca Treehouse Project.  This building is the main gathering spot including a kitchen, bathroom, and laundry area.  It will have 12 inches of soil on the roof, so that we can grow food in the same square footage as the sheltered living space.</p>
<p><strong>Here is the breakdown of costs:</strong></p>
<p>$1800 engineering for footing and Posts</p>
<p>$2800 budget for concrete &amp; steel</p>
<p>$400 mortar and sand to lay the bricks that we already have, which are reclaimed from Clemson University. Thank you for those of you who helped me chip mortar, sort, and stack those brick! </p>
<p>When complete, the project will have 16 spaces available to visit and experience sustainable living.  These spaces will be used for our students during training sessions and events. We estimate a minimum of 5000 visitors to the site annually through tours, workshops, and airbnb experiences with a goal to Inspire &amp; empower people to live in harmony with our planet. </p>
<h3><strong>1 and 5 year Goals</strong></h3>
<p><u>Our One year Goal for 2019</u> is to Finish building the Seneca Treehouse Project and teach 50 Students in our <strong><i>Learn to Build</i></strong>, <strong><i>Design to Live</i></strong>, and <strong><i>Family Summer Camp</i></strong> programs.  Once STP is done, <strong>we will be open full time</strong> for tours, workshops, and airbnb. This is when Treehouse Trade School really begins to unfold! </p>
<p><u>Our 5 Year Goal:</u> Full time operation of <i><strong>Treehouse Trade School,</strong></i> teaching hands on, applied learning &amp; training soldiers for sustainability aka <strong>Tree Scouts!</strong>  </p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h2>What makes <strong>History Adventures</strong> a uniquely impactful learning experience?</h2><h3>Three key ideas: </h3><ul>
<li>
<strong>A Fresh Approach to Learning About our Past:</strong>  Introducing  a profoundly innovative approach to history curriculum, interdisciplinary, and <strong>epic in scope</strong><ul><li> Inspired by the ground-breaking work of the International Big History Association</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Mobile Entertainment Design:</strong> History Adventures uses the latest mobile entertainment design technology--combining <strong>motion comics</strong> with <strong>interaction design</strong><ul><li>Including motion fx, cinematics, animation, sound fx, and original music</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>The Power of Story:</strong> Our innovative approach of <strong>narrativizing</strong> the life stories of peoples who lived in past centuries--in different epochs and locations around the globe--does <i>not</i> bore students with lists of random, irrelevant facts and dates, but rather:<ul><li>Students will <strong>experience</strong> the very real moments these very real people lived through, as if <i>they were there</i>. And via the empathy inspired by good <strong>storytelling</strong>, students will feel the life or death stakes of decisions made in the moment, (whose often dire consequences, only now--centuries later--appear as cold, dead facts!).</li></ul>
</li>
</ul><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/lZ0ktUm3lZQ?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><h3>History Adventures brings the past to life!</h3><p>The famed historian, Yuval Noah Harari, claims the glue that binds societies together is not genes, but rather, <strong>stories</strong>.  Through the power of story, one's <strong>imagination</strong> opens out to the world, giving meaning to the things we see, places we travel, people we love--stories even give shape to our darkest fears. </p><p>Partially inspired by Robert Garland’s ""The Other Side of History: Daily Life in the Ancient World"": History Adventures will focus on narrativized key moments in the life stories of peoples who lived in past centuries, in different epochs and locations around the globe. </p><p>The narrative structure of History Adventures will be like zooming in through a portal in time, to observe--and <strong>feel the drama and excitement</strong>--of little slices of lived human experience, from so long ago. These narratives are punctuated with explanations of where or how certain objects or ideas in the modern world originated--revealing complexity, interconnections, and richer context for understanding our own moment in time. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552856741/gz6ynptw3hsgdxfxjd5o.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>Ordinary People doing Extraordinary Things</h3><p>Importantly, none of the characters will be famous. At least not world famous, and larger than life, such as Alexander, Cleopatra, or Napoleon. Instead they will be <strong>normal people, living extraordinary lives</strong>. You will experience the thrill and danger of being a Polynesian deep sea explorer and settler--becoming the first human to set foot on Fiji, some 3,000 years ago.</p><p>You will experience vivid glimpses into the lifeways of people from all over the world, and all throughout time:</p><ul>
<li>a morose Samurai with a broken heart</li>
<li>a Spanish conquistador in 16th century Peru suffering hallucinations from tropical fever</li>
<li>an Ancient Sumerian scribe, unwittingly driving forward, the development of systematic writing, the greatest threshold in human collective learning up to that point</li>
<li>a doctor in Ancient Greece pioneering modern medical inquiry</li>
<li>or, you could be a wayward 17 year old Roman citizen, living at the height of Roman power; finding yourself drifting, <i>lethally</i>, into the city's criminal underworld, only to discover a way out--signing up for a 25 year term of service as a Roman Legionary in the world's first professional army. </li>
</ul><p>And this, of course, is where our story begins, with Duro's travails in Ancient Rome, entitled, <strong><a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/history-adventures/id1446598708?mt=11"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""Chapter III: Conscribo.""</a></strong>  The 16 page fully animated demo is available now, for free, on <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/history-adventures/id1446598708?mt=11"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">iTunes</a>.</p><p>This will be the first in a serialized--and infinitely expanding--network of stories from history. Collectively, as more and more stories are added to this narrative-based scaleable platform, (magic book?), the human experience will be revealed in richer detail than ever before in the digital pages of <strong>History Adventures</strong>. </p><h3><strong>About the Founder: Spencer Striker, PhD </strong></h3><p>My passion for combining <strong>history education</strong> with <strong>digital media technology</strong> goes back twenty years, to when I completed undergrad degrees in both History and Film Production at the University of Texas. I later cut my teeth in online media entrepreneurship by starting a web video company, called GameZombie TV, a four-time Webby Award winning game media studio that ran successfully from 2007-2012, Pursuing my passion for education entrepreneurship, I went on to become a co-founder of the Media Arts &amp; Game Development program at the University of Wisconsin at Whitewater. During this same action-packed time, I earned a PhD in Digital Media from the number one Education Department in the world, the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where I studied under some of the leading experts on Digital Media &amp; Learning, (including Kurt Squire and Constance Steinkuehler). My doctoral work at UW-Madison laid the groundwork for my History Adventures interactive digital learning concept.</p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552855447/g6da9qfq4vcgwghmt0pb.jpg"" src=""""/></strong><br/><br/>In 2013, I became founding creative director for a digital media and learning startup based in Mountain View, CA - called Galxyz, Inc. - which secured $3m in Series A funding from Relay Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, and Laurene Powell Jobs’ Emerson Collective; (Galxyz can be found in the iTunes App Store). I spearheaded Galxyz’ product and creative from concept to full-fledged startup--overseeing product design; building an international team of cross-functional mobile app professionals; and creatively directing a scalable, narrative-themed mobile, digital learning product. </p><div>
<p>Since coming to Dubai--and joining the American University in Dubai’s Digital Media faculty--my goal has been to launch a successful digital learning startup in what I consider to be one of the most innovative cities of the 21st century. Beginning day one in Dubai, I began conceptualizing the prototype for History Adventures--but more importantly, assembling a world-class, international team of experts that I knew could get the job done. </p>

<h3>
<br/><strong>Production Timeline - from idea to Live Demo!</strong>
</h3>
<p>And here's a quick sketch of the timeline and hard work it took us to get to this point, where we're ready to scale <strong>History Adventures</strong> to the next level!</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>June 2016:</strong> Awarded Summer Research Institute Fellowship to the Harris Manchester College at Oxford; conducted design and curriculum research</li>
<li>
<strong>July 2016:</strong> Digital Learning design research presentation delivered at the International Big History Association Conference in Amsterdam</li>
<li>
<strong>April 2, 2017:</strong> Dr. Jonathan Markley, leading Big Historian, comes to AUD campus and speaks on topic of Innovating Visual Educational Multimedia. Consults on History Adventures.</li>
<li>
<strong>May 17, 2017:</strong> Out of over 700 entries, the digital learning concept wins 5th place in the Dubai Smartpreneur 2.0 Competition, as part of the Dubai Chamber Smart City Initiative.</li>
<li>
<strong>Nov 7-9, 2017:</strong> History Adventures receives competitive invitation to exhibit a live demo on the showroom floor of Web Summit 2017, the largest technology conference in the world.</li>
<li>
<strong>March 28, 2018:  </strong>Official selection to 2018 Step Conference in Dubai.</li>
<li>
<strong>Dec 12, 2018: </strong>History Adventures, <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/history-adventures/id1446598708?mt=11"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ch. III Conscribo</a>, goes live on iTunes in 52 countries!</li>

</ul>

<h3><strong>So... why are we asking for $50k?</strong></h3>
<p>It's because the product is ready for the next level. While bootstrapping and self-funding, History Adventures to date: we've proven out an <strong>efficient, scaleable production methodology</strong>. We've even pulled off tricks with regard to 2D and 3D interactive animation running stably on a mobile device that few teams could replicate. The professional historians on our team are incredibly enthusiastic about the potential for the product to bring the stodgy old ways of teaching history into the 21st Century. And most importantly, the students that have play-tested the demo enjoyed the experience as they would an animated, entertainment app--while their post-test answers to relevant history questions showed improved retention. So why is that? <br/><br/>It's the combination of the <strong>three factors</strong>: a revitalized Big History curricular approach; the design aesthetics of the best mobile entertainment; and the <strong>power of story</strong>. </p>
<h3>Five More Chapters by the end of Summer 2019!</h3>
<p>Our goal is to build five new chapters by summer's end: each focused on a unique character, with a unique narrative--and all of whom living in different times, places, and circumstances around the globe.</p>
<p>Through our standardized production methodology, we've innovated ways to speed up production while bringing costs down. And this trend will only continue! To create our next 5 historical character micro-narratives will require: research, writing, history curriculum, illustration, animation for mobile, specialized motion fx, animated infographics, custom 3D animation, video editing, sound design, music, voice acting, and consultation with top historians and digital literacy experts.</p>
<p>And as a key part of our <strong>History Adventures</strong> perks: we're going to provide you, our fans and supporters, buy-in on key creative decisions--allowing you to be a part of the story at times, and to literally see yourself in history. Since the goal of History Adventures is to spark enthusiasm for the past, and <strong>bring the pages of history to life</strong>, it's only fitting to give partial ownership of the product and its historical micro-narratives to you--the readers, supporters, and fans--to make the connection between past and present that much more <strong>visceral, tangible, and real. </strong></p>

A Fresh Approach to Learning About our Past:  Introducing  a profoundly innovative approach to history curriculum, interdisciplinary, and epic in scope Inspired by the ground-breaking work of the International Big History Association


Mobile Entertainment Design: History Adventures uses the latest mobile entertainment design technology--combining motion comics with interaction designIncluding motion fx, cinematics, animation, sound fx, and original music


The Power of Story: Our innovative approach of narrativizing the life stories of peoples who lived in past centuries--in different epochs and locations around the globe--does not bore students with lists of random, irrelevant facts and dates, but rather:Students will experience the very real moments these very real people lived through, as if they were there. And via the empathy inspired by good storytelling, students will feel the life or death stakes of decisions made in the moment, (whose often dire consequences, only now--centuries later--appear as cold, dead facts!).

History Adventures brings the past to life!The famed historian, Yuval Noah Harari, claims the glue that binds societies together is not genes, but rather, stories.  Through the power of story, one's imagination opens out to the world, giving meaning to the things we see, places we travel, people we love--stories even give shape to our darkest fears. Partially inspired by Robert Garland’s ""The Other Side of History: Daily Life in the Ancient World"": History Adventures will focus on narrativized key moments in the life stories of peoples who lived in past centuries, in different epochs and locations around the globe. The narrative structure of History Adventures will be like zooming in through a portal in time, to observe--and feel the drama and excitement--of little slices of lived human experience, from so long ago. These narratives are punctuated with explanations of where or how certain objects or ideas in the modern world originated--revealing complexity, interconnections, and richer context for understanding our own moment in time. Ordinary People doing Extraordinary ThingsImportantly, none of the characters will be famous. At least not world famous, and larger than life, such as Alexander, Cleopatra, or Napoleon. Instead they will be normal people, living extraordinary lives. You will experience the thrill and danger of being a Polynesian deep sea explorer and settler--becoming the first human to set foot on Fiji, some 3,000 years ago.You will experience vivid glimpses into the lifeways of people from all over the world, and all throughout time:
a morose Samurai with a broken heart
a Spanish conquistador in 16th century Peru suffering hallucinations from tropical fever
an Ancient Sumerian scribe, unwittingly driving forward, the development of systematic writing, the greatest threshold in human collective learning up to that point
a doctor in Ancient Greece pioneering modern medical inquiry
or, you could be a wayward 17 year old Roman citizen, living at the height of Roman power; finding yourself drifting, lethally, into the city's criminal underworld, only to discover a way out--signing up for a 25 year term of service as a Roman Legionary in the world's first professional army. 
And this, of course, is where our story begins, with Duro's travails in Ancient Rome, entitled, ""Chapter III: Conscribo.""  The 16 page fully animated demo is available now, for free, on iTunes.This will be the first in a serialized--and infinitely expanding--network of stories from history. Collectively, as more and more stories are added to this narrative-based scaleable platform, (magic book?), the human experience will be revealed in richer detail than ever before in the digital pages of History Adventures. About the Founder: Spencer Striker, PhD My passion for combining history education with digital media technology goes back twenty years, to when I completed undergrad degrees in both History and Film Production at the University of Texas. I later cut my teeth in online media entrepreneurship by starting a web video company, called GameZombie TV, a four-time Webby Award winning game media studio that ran successfully from 2007-2012, Pursuing my passion for education entrepreneurship, I went on to become a co-founder of the Media Arts & Game Development program at the University of Wisconsin at Whitewater. During this same action-packed time, I earned a PhD in Digital Media from the number one Education Department in the world, the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where I studied under some of the leading experts on Digital Media & Learning, (including Kurt Squire and Constance Steinkuehler). My doctoral work at UW-Madison laid the groundwork for my History Adventures interactive digital learning concept.In 2013, I became founding creative director for a digital media and learning startup based in Mountain View, CA - called Galxyz, Inc. - which secured $3m in Series A funding from Relay Ventures, Andreessen Horowitz, and Laurene Powell Jobs’ Emerson Collective; (Galxyz can be found in the iTunes App Store). I spearheaded Galxyz’ product and creative from concept to full-fledged startup--overseeing product design; building an international team of cross-functional mobile app professionals; and creatively directing a scalable, narrative-themed mobile, digital learning product. 
Since coming to Dubai--and joining the American University in Dubai’s Digital Media faculty--my goal has been to launch a successful digital learning startup in what I consider to be one of the most innovative cities of the 21st century. Beginning day one in Dubai, I began conceptualizing the prototype for History Adventures--but more importantly, assembling a world-class, international team of experts that I knew could get the job done.

Production Timeline - from idea to Live Demo!

And here's a quick sketch of the timeline and hard work it took us to get to this point, where we're ready to scale History Adventures to the next level!



June 2016: Awarded Summer Research Institute Fellowship to the Harris Manchester College at Oxford; conducted design and curriculum research

July 2016: Digital Learning design research presentation delivered at the International Big History Association Conference in Amsterdam

April 2, 2017: Dr. Jonathan Markley, leading Big Historian, comes to AUD campus and speaks on topic of Innovating Visual Educational Multimedia. Consults on History Adventures.

May 17, 2017: Out of over 700 entries, the digital learning concept wins 5th place in the Dubai Smartpreneur 2.0 Competition, as part of the Dubai Chamber Smart City Initiative.

Nov 7-9, 2017: History Adventures receives competitive invitation to exhibit a live demo on the showroom floor of Web Summit 2017, the largest technology conference in the world.

March 28, 2018:  Official selection to 2018 Step Conference in Dubai.

Dec 12, 2018: History Adventures, Ch. III Conscribo, goes live on iTunes in 52 countries!

Feb 13, 2019: hands-on demo of v2.0, as official selection to the 2019 Step Conference.

Feb 22, 2019: First demo of History Adventures for Asian audience at Slush Tokyo, Japan

March 19, 2019: History Adventures Indiegogo official crowdfund launch!!


So... why are we asking for $50k?
It's because the product is ready for the next level. While bootstrapping and self-funding, History Adventures to date: we've proven out an efficient, scaleable production methodology. We've even pulled off tricks with regard to 2D and 3D interactive animation running stably on a mobile device that few teams could replicate. The professional historians on our team are incredibly enthusiastic about the potential for the product to bring the stodgy old ways of teaching history into the 21st Century. And most importantly, the students that have play-tested the demo enjoyed the experience as they would an animated, entertainment app--while their post-test answers to relevant history questions showed improved retention. So why is that? It's the combination of the three factors: a revitalized Big History curricular approach; the design aesthetics of the best mobile entertainment; and the power of story. 
Five More Chapters by the end of Summer 2019!
Our goal is to build five new chapters by summer's end: each focused on a unique character, with a unique narrative--and all of whom living in different times, places, and circumstances around the globe.
Through our standardized production methodology, we've innovated ways to speed up production while bringing costs down. And this trend will only continue! To create our next 5 historical character micro-narratives will require: research, writing, history curriculum, illustration, animation for mobile, specialized motion fx, animated infographics, custom 3D animation, video editing, sound design, music, voice acting, and consultation with top historians and digital literacy experts.
And as a key part of our History Adventures perks: we're going to provide you, our fans and supporters, buy-in on key creative decisions--allowing you to be a part of the story at times, and to literally see yourself in history. Since the goal of History Adventures is to spark enthusiasm for the past, and bring the pages of history to life, it's only fitting to give partial ownership of the product and its historical micro-narratives to you--the readers, supporters, and fans--to make the connection between past and present that much more visceral, tangible, and real.",2.0,3,"1 Campaign

The woman who brings MonkeyPlay to them and the reason many of them didn’t fight with their parents about going to school on the day I am there. Kids love MonkeyPlay and parents use it as a means to get the kids out the door!</p><p>Five years ago I founded the nonprofit public charity, Hutan For World Health to improve the quality of life. I have a rather unusual background as both an ethologist and a personal trainer. This entails the study of animal behavior in the wild, and, as a trainer, it’s all about how to get and keep humans healthy. For thirty years I have devoted my time to improving well being in humans by designing and implementing programs, and equally as much time to studying animal behavior for the purpose of gaining first hand knowledge in the human-wildlife conflict affecting endangered species. When I created Hutan I was able to blend these two very different career paths into one. A path that is not only fulfilling and purposeful but one that I love.</p><p> </p><p>What are we up against?</p><p>There are a lot of problems facing children today. Problems that are far different than the ones we faced as children. Because they are living extremely sedentary lives it is not uncommon for children to leave preschool with up to four risk factors for heart disease: high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, high levels of body fat and fatty streaks in the arteries. They now spend more than seven and a half hours a day in front of a screen.</p><p> Have We Traded Health For Technology?</p><p>The growth and expansion of technology has reached a point where pretty much everything we need or want is available at the touch of a button. Learning, play and entertainment can all be accessed without ever leaving the sofa. For parents it has become much easier to have sedentary children due to the pressures of balancing work and family life. If you are a parent in this era of information and technology, chances are you have a child who has played, is playing right now, or will be playing video games. Juggling school, work, home, and community lives, parents now rely heavily on entertainment technology  to make their lives easier. All of this “sitting” is coming at a price; and a vital one at that. Health. As technology and sedentary choices change the way we live, those who suffer most are our children.</p><p>So what is the impact of technology on the toddlers and preschoolers?</p><p>During a child’s developmental stages their sensory, motor, and attachment systems have biologically not evolved to accommodate this sedentary, yet frenzied and chaotic nature of today’s technology. The impact of technology on the developing child has seen an increase of physical, psychological and behavior disorders that the health and education systems are just beginning to detect, much less understand. Diagnoses of ADHD, autism, coordination disorder, developmental delays-means that a young child is slower to reach milestones than other children, unintelligible speech, anxiety, depression, and sleep disorders are associated with technology overuse, and are increasing at an alarming rate. As children “sit” hour upon hour we are ignoring the elephant in the room. Sedentary bodies bombarded with frenzied sensory stimulation are resulting in the delay of developmental milestones, and have negative impacts on basic fundamental motor skill progress. If you combine this with the trend of preschool and kindergarten settings becoming much more regimented and adult-directed, because teachers are encouraged to increase literacy and numeracy instruction at the expense of play time, there is a staggering amount of time children are inactive.  These sedentary behaviors are stealing children's health right out from under our noses, eliminating crucial aspects of emotional growth, and setting them up for a lifetime of disease. As children now rely on technology for the majority of their play, grossly limiting challenges to their creativity and imaginations, as well as limiting necessary challenges to their bodies to achieve optimal sensory and motor development we are seeing more developmental delays.</p><p>Do we have to get rid of physical activity and play to make room for learning?</p><p>The answer to this is a big fat NO. There is a huge connection between motor development, play, and the physical health and abilities of young children. Research has taught us that removing play from early childhood classrooms may actually undermine intended achievement-oriented outcomes because play enhances attention, memory, self-regulation, and overall academic achievement throughout childhood. In short, physical play is necessary for learning and is critical to development. Children play because it is fun. It’s the lens through which they experience their world. Play feels good. By giving children the freedom to play we provide opportunities for them to discover new ways of thinking and doing things. It facilitates the ability to be creative later in life. When we suppress children’s freedom, their creative abilities remarkably decline.</p><p>So, how does  MonkeyPlay address all this?</p><p>MonkeyPlay creates a foundation for developing physical literacy–the “ability, confidence and desire to be physically active.” It encompasses doing, interpreting, responding and understanding, and signals an interplay with our surroundings. It involves fundamental locomotor skills, aerobic conditioning, imagination, hand eye coordination, and agility, while encouraging interaction with others. The program is based on play. That is the first half.</p><p>MonkeyPlay is also the first movement-based learning system of its kind. While children move and mimic animal behaviors they learn letters, site words, counting, geography and animal behavior.  They use their bodies and their minds simultaneously. As the studies have shown when children move while they are learning, they activate more parts of the brain than when they are sitting still.  In particular, movement has been found to activate the visual association cortex—the part of the brain that allows the processing of visual information. “Learning by doing” has never been better supported by science. That is the second half.</p><p>What do we need and what do you get?</p><p>Recently we were awarded a small grant by the 5 Healthy Towns coalition to run a MonkeyPlay intervention in Chelsea Michigan reaching 80 children. Yay! This is a big deal because we will finally be able to get the research we need to demonstrate just how effective MonkeyPlay is. But we still need about $1500 to complete the package. I have included the budget breakdown so you will be able to see all the details of our needs. If you are part of a business and would like to group your employees together to donate the full amount, not only will the business get a write off (we are a 501c3) but your company name will be mentioned in the manuals and in the follow up articles we write. You will be a huge part in making this intervention happen. If you are an individual who donates $200 or more you will also get a tax write off and we will include your name as a donor who helped make the intervention possible. We want to recognize you!</p><p> </p><p>So what kind of impact will this program have?</p><p>Not only will you help us to get 80 children off on the right foot you will help impact the lives of their families and the community. Healthy happy children make happy parents, happy teachers, happy grandparents, happy siblings. Well, you get the idea. One life has an enormous impact on the other lives it touches. And, we don't plan to stop here. Our goal is to train teacher coaches so the program becomes self sustaining changing the way education is taught to the youngest members of society.</p><p>What kind of obstacles do we face?</p><p>Are you kidding!!! We are talking about behavior change and there is nothing more difficult to evoke than that. We get it. We have been at this type of work for a very long time. On the other hand, we have already seen the positive impacts on the lives of children. When it is MonkeyPlay day children want to come to school.

Everyone these days has a cause and a hand out to collect your money. So, maybe you know a business owner who would be interested in getting some recognition for helping kids.

The new platform was launched in December 2017  aims to empower parents by providing customized knowledge – in Arabic – through articles and video interviews with experts giving practical guidance, as well as interviews with parents sharing their personal experiences and recommendations. Another important goal of Habaybna.net is to contest the negative stereotypes facing children with disability and focus on their special talents instead.“The name Habaybna means “Our beloved ones” in Arabic, Reem Alafranji explains. “It reflects our firm belief that our children are our beloved ones regardless of their abilities.”When Reem and Mohammed discovered their children’s challenges, they tried to find out where to start their new life journey and how to best support their sons.“It turned out we couldn’t find any reliable resources in Arabic that would provide guidance and practical information,” Mohammed says. There were many websites and articles in English but that information was not customized to an Arab audience, and did not explain which resources and services were available in the Arab countries.“Clearly, this is a major challenge in the Middle East for parents with children who have developmental disabilities, so we decided to do something to address this”, Reem says.Why we need youWe want to take habaybna.net to the next level by: 

Technology: Raising $25,000 will help us build an interactive technology and a directory for service providers in Jordan so parents can connect with specialists and service providers.  

Technology & Content: Getting $50,000 We will build an online video library with at least 1,000 videos by specialists and parents so other parents will be empowered with the guidance and information on how to deal with their children with developmental disabilities.

Mobile Application:  Reaching $75,000 We will develop a mobile application with features that enable parents to access and interact with organizations, doctors, specialists and service providers.

Outreach: reaching the $100,000 goal will enable us to deliver the information to families living in less privileged areas who have children with disabilities throughout conducting information sessions at their communities.
