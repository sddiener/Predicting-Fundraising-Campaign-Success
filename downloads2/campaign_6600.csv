<h3>TRANSMOGRIFY: Sarasota's Premiere Arts Magazine!<br/>
</h3>Hi, I'm Erin Johnson, an artist, filmmaker and musician, and graduate of Ringling College of Art + Design in Sarasota, FL. A small dedicated team and I have been working non-stop for over a year to launch Sarasota's premiere arts magazine. <b>Considering that Sarasota is an outstanding arts-city on the international map (and has been since the roaring 20's), it is about time that there is a local magazine dedicated to the arts!</b> Transmogrify features artists, musicians, filmmakers, photographers, animators, fantasy and sci-fi illustrators, sculptors, graphic designers, architects, fashion experts, performance artists, muralists and many other creatives, with upscale design and editorial impact that highlights art as not just something cool to look at, but also as a society and reality-changing force of nature! Our interviews feature artists in their own words, with a diverse mix of art styles featured, and compelling content that readers of any age-group can appreciate. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/262497/files/20131215160814-Transmogrify_Schin_Jan_2014_Cover_72dpi.jpg?1387152494"" src="""" style=""width: 542.321px; height: 701px;""/></p>

</h3>
<p><b>Sarasota is filled to the brim with brilliant artists of many disciplines. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these artists often fly under the public radar,</b> because they are not featured enough in other area media, or due in part to narrowly focused arts curating, plus other factors. <br/></p>
<p>One conversation commonly heard in and around Sarasota questions why talents of all ages are leaving for other places. Why do these brilliant artistic minds migrate elsewhere? TRANSMOGRIFY will offer artists a voice, recognition. With this recognition of artists and what's actually happening in the arts comes increased public excitement, awareness and understanding, which in turn contributes to a renewed investment into creative community, collaboration and innovation, thus an expanded cultural infrastructure to support diverse creatives. TRANSMOGRIFY hopes to provide a much needed stimulus that energizes the art scene, by filling a large but seemingly invisible gap in media arts coverage. As Sarasota continues to define itself within the international arts scene, diverse representation of artists and varied art disciplines is key. In an arts community, let's make art visible: in the artist's own words! <br/></p>
<p>Transmogrify will illuminate to the world exactly what we have in Sarasota: an astounding array of brilliant creatives who are changing the world! This in turn will boost the local creative culture, quite possibly the creative economy, and enhance Sarasota as an already popular arts destination, while at the same time helping artists (of many disciplines) launch their careers in positive ways. It's about inspiring and building community while creating awareness of the vast amount of astounding creative talent Sarasota has to offer. We might even get a little controversial while were at it... art is full of controversy! <br/></p>
<p><b>Since Spring 2013, we've talked with hundreds of people in Sarasota, from all walks, income levels, ages, occupations, and every single person loves our mini-sample edition of TRANSMOGRIFY, and the mission the magazine represents.</b> Everyone ""on the street"" unanimously agrees that this magazine would be a positive addition to the local media scene. They love our articles too! </p>

<i>Above: Art by Chris Marcet, plus exclusive interview with the artist. </i><br/><p>Until people see a full-color magazine in their hands, they have trouble visualizing it. Once we print and distribute this 1st edition, with your help, people will know what TRANSMOGRIFY is all about! Readers and art lovers can decide for themselves!  </p>
<p>Some might ask: ""Why make a print magazine? Isn't 'print' dead?"" Hardly. People love to curl up with a good magazine no matter where! With the migration of many things to the Internet these days, and with all the time we spend pointing and clicking in front of a screen, there's nothing like a tangible, physical magazine to relax with, whether on a plane, at a salon, or at home. Combining this with insightful journalism and fantastic art of myriad styles, makes TRANSMOGRIFY print editions highly collectible (plus maybe a bit more lively and shareable than a flat pdf reader on your computer screen). <br/></p>
<p>Those of us in Sarasota already may be aware of how lopsided the art-representation can be here sometimes. Certain styles are emphasized, while others become marginalized, no matter how brilliant or pertinent to society and arts globally. </p>
<p>A thriving arts community needs independent media voices! By supporting this campaign, you make the magazine possible. TRANSMOGRIFY's journalism is 100%  free from corporate or sponsor control. We don't pander to advertisers either. This is about freedom of the press, freedom of thought, expression and freedom through art.  <br/></p>
<p>Getting there in style: TRANSMOGRIFY features layouts and content different from the other magazines. It's not about art fluff in nice packaging either. TRANSMOGRIFY already has a backlog of high profile artist interviews, which puts it on the par with other national and international art magazines. These unique interviews are important to the arts, and society and so we must publish.       <br/></p>
<p><b>We need your support!</b> As collaborators with Internet capabilities, you have the power to launch this magazine - and in the process help artists get the audiences they truly need, inspiring thousands of potential readers (including international readership interests), who are eager for something new. New York, San Francisco, Paris, Los Angeles... many worldwide cities have art magazines with challenging and thought provoking content! It's time for Sarasota to have such a magazine. It's time to TRANSMOGRIFY! Sarasota will be TRANSMOGRIFY's spawning ground and we have big plans for future expansion as well. TRANSMOGRIFY features international artists because we live in a global community. TRANSMOGRIFY LOCALLY &amp; GLOBALLY! However, the first edition of TRANSMOGRIFY, which we need help to print first before anything else, will be distributed exclusively in Sarasota for FREE (plus mail order)! <br/></p>

<p><strong>THE EXPEDITION HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED! ALL GOALS WERE MET. I'LL BE TELLING THE STORY ON MY BLOG OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AT WWW.FOXSTUDIO.BIZ. THANK YOU TO EVERYONE WHO CONTRIBUTED!<br/></strong></p>
<p><br/><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Support a groundbreaking international artist’s collaboration! For the first time ever, American and Mongol artists will travel deep into a remote area of the Gobi Desert of Mongolia to observe endangered species and habitats.</strong></p>

<p><br/><strong>HOW IT STARTED</strong><br/><br/>My art career began in the late 1970s as a sign painter and freelance graphic designer and and then as an illustrator. Since 1997 I’ve been a full time oil painter. For the past four years I’ve specialized in Mongolian subject matter and, as far as I know, I am the only American artist doing so.<br/><br/>I conceived the idea for the WildArt Mongolia Expedition two years ago. I’ve been to Mongolia seven times since 2005, traveling deep into the countryside, seeing wonderful things, having many memorable experiences, taking thousands of photos and then coming home to create my paintings of the wildlife, land and people of Mongolia. I’ve come to love the Land of Blue Skies and want to give back to a place that has given me so much.<br/><br/>I have learned how much artists are respected and valued in Mongol culture and found that if I say “bi zuraach bain”- “I am an artist”, to someone, it makes a very good impression.</p>
<p>The WildArt Mongolia Expedition, as a Mongol and American artist collaboration, is an ideal way to support conservation in Mongolia. It will be a real expedition into an area far off the tourist track where even the traditional herder families are few and far between.</p>
<p><img alt=""Maikhan"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://foxstudio.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/wam-maikhan-1.jpg?w=584&amp;h=390"" src="""" style="""" title=""Maikhan""/></p>
<p><strong>The Expedition maikhan- an authentic Mongol summer tent which served as our dining hall</strong><br/><br/><strong>WHAT WE DID- THE CONSERVATION CONNECTION</strong><br/><br/>The Expedition took place between August 23 and September 10 of this year. We left Ulaanbaatar, heading south and then west to the Altai Mountains and Great Gobi B Strictly Protected Area, then turning north to a famous area in Mongolia called Sharga, and finally back to Ulaanbaatar.</p>

The WildArt Mongolia Expedition featured four of those species: snow leopard, takhi/Przewalski’s horse, khulan/Mongolian wild ass and the critically endangered saiga antelope. We met and consulted with scientists who study these species learning about them and the conservation challenges they face.</p>

The WildArt Mongolia Expedition will be visiting the first site, which is to the south at Takhiin Tal.</strong><br/><br/>There is widespread grassroots support for conservation in a country with a land ethic that goes back over 1000 years. Mongolia is a place where I believe artists can really make a difference. The story of the Expedition and the art we create and share will raise awareness in both Mongolia and the United States about about the places we will go and why conserving them and the wild animals who live there is important.</p>

<p><strong>Gobi earth road</strong><br/><br/>Due to the remoteness of our destination, reliable vehicles, drivers and a guide familiar with the area are essential. I have used Nomadic Journeys for six of my seven trips (the first one was an Earthwatch project in 2005). They will handle the Expedition arrangements. It will cost about $2500 for each of the Mongol artists. This will cover transport in Russian fergon vans, their drivers, an experienced English-speaking guide, a cook, food and tents for almost three weeks in the field.<br/></p>

If the goal is not reached, your contribution will be used to cover as much of their costs as possible. If it's exceeded then it will be applied to the costs as needed for the other artists or set aside as seed money for the projects that will take place after the Expedition....the exhibition, book and multi-media presentation.<br/><br/>I think once you learn about the Mongol artists from the campaign video and my website you will agree that they bring a variety of exciting artistic visions to the Expedition. <br/><br/>I spent time with all of them last year as the result of an art event hosted for me by an Ulaanbaatar art gallery. The Expedition information was translated into Mongolian and distributed throughout the artists community. These were the four who came forward and asked to go. I’m very honored to have the opportunity to travel with them.<br/><br/><br/><strong>ABOUT THE PERKS</strong><br/><br/>The titles of my perks are based on what the Mongols call “The Five Snouts”, the livestock animals that they traditionally depend on.  “Khadags” are the traditional blue offering scarves that are given in both appreciation of and to honor a person. It seemed very appropriate to me to offer them as a gift to everyone who is kind enough to support the Expedition.

<p>Hi! I'm Tanya and I’m an artist/author. Random ideas are always flowing through my head making it difficult for me to focus on just one....focus... focus...  </p>
<p><strong>What is Buttons, Kings, and Strange Little Things?</strong></p>
<p>Oh right, ""Buttons, Kings, and Strange Little Things"" is a collection of six short stories, all written in rhyme. Each page is an original painting which will then be professionally scanned and digitally enhanced! </p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>What does it look like? </strong></p>
<p>The book will be 11""x14"" and it will have 100-110 beautifully printed full color pages with a hardcover. Being part of this funding means you are also part of the making of ""Buttons, Kings, and Strange Little Things"". I will post frequent updates, with pictures and text, and will greatly appreciate your feedback!  </p>

Meet the characters! 

 
 
A little about me... 
Hi! I'm Tanya and I’m an artist/author. Random ideas are always flowing through my head making it difficult for me to focus on just one....focus... focus...  
What is Buttons, Kings, and Strange Little Things?
Oh right, ""Buttons, Kings, and Strange Little Things"" is a collection of six short stories, all written in rhyme. Each page is an original painting which will then be professionally scanned and digitally enhanced! 
 

 
What does it look like? 
The book will be 11""x14"" and it will have 100-110 beautifully printed full color pages with a hardcover. Being part of this funding means you are also part of the making of ""Buttons, Kings, and Strange Little Things"". I will post frequent updates, with pictures and text, and will greatly appreciate your feedback!  
(The text will eventually be inside the images... have to find the perfect font!)




What's the money for?
I have some initial funding as a head start, but I would like to give you the BEST quality book so I need to raise $5000 for productions costs. This money will all go towards printing, shipping, small prints, and art supplies.

I am a student who has been interested in art from a young age. In grade school, art was my favorite class and I was one of the few kids excited at the prospect of indoor recess so I could sit and scribble my heart out. In middle school, a friend mentioned that my drawings bore some similarity to anime/manga. At  that point, I began watching classic shojo anime (Sailor Moon and Card Captor Sakura), and that is where it all began. Since then I have been watching anime, reading manga, and consistently developing and reshaping my artistic style.

<p>To create the touchscreen artworks I will need to purchase tablets that will be altered and hacked to create he artworks. I aim to buy 4 of these each costing £60.56. I will also need to buy 3 projector mounts each costing £21.99. Along with this various materials will be needed to construct the forms on which I will project. Any money left after this will be used for business cards and promotion for the show.</p>
<p>I will be incredibly grateful to anyone who contributes any donation to this project and will thank you all individually. On top of my thanks I am offering various incentives from digital postcards to guided tours of the exhibition, which are listed fully below.</p>

</h2>
<h5><font size=""2"">I  thought a nice way of saying thank you would be to 'pay it forward'!</font></h5>
<h5><font size=""2"">As a thank you for the new kiln I decided to christen it by making a large rainbow chandelier which I will auction, donating  ALL of the proceeds towards 'The Rainbow Trust'.  You can check them out here: </font></h5>

<div><font size=""2""> This is a wonderful local charity that supports families of terminally and seriously ill children.</font></div>
<div><font size=""2"">I've also offered a workshop day to work with some of the kids to show them how to make some pendants of their own which we'll hang as part of the chandelier.</font></div>

credit record - thanks Lloyds!).  Such a shame, It's so exciting and I'm loving it, especially as I've been able to keep the whole recycled ethos central to the project. I hope I can build this into something really special.

 What I Need 
The trouble the only kiln I I could afford was 25 years old, second hand and very small and though it's done a great job, it just can't keep up with the work load, so I just can't make enough lights quickly enough.
I would love it if you could help me raise £2000 to buy a new kiln?  The difference it would make to me would be huge and i can't tell you how grateful I would be for the support. What can I give in return?

I  thought a nice way of saying thank you would be to 'pay it forward'!
As a thank you for the new kiln I decided to christen it by making a large rainbow chandelier which I will auction, donating  ALL of the proceeds towards 'The Rainbow Trust'.  You can check them out here: 
www.rainbowtrust.org.uk
 This is a wonderful local charity that supports families of terminally and seriously ill children.
I've also offered a workshop day to work with some of the kids to show them how to make some pendants of their own which we'll hang as part of the chandelier.
 I'll also give an 20%  'Angel' discount to everyone to donates who orders a recycled glass lamp from me this year.
Other Ways You Can Help
Spread the word for me where ever you can?  Know anyone that enjoys art, supports recycling or would just like the whole idea?",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

I have recently expanded my area of interest to include forced marriages in Pakistani and Indian communities. A forced marriage takes place when the bride, groom or both do not want to get married but are forced to by others, usually their families. People forced into marriage may be tricked into going abroad, physically threatened and/or emotionally blackmailed to do so. Every year, hundreds of young people in the United States, both male and female, are forced into marriage against their will, often by violence and blackmail from their own families and relatives.<br/><p><strong>I would like to start my own small nonprofit to help these victims. This nonprofit will help individuals wanting to get out of a forced marriage, give them a safe place to live, and begin their path to freedom.</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Initially, I am starting the campaign at $1500 to have a small office in my home but would like to buy an old house ($40k-$50k) and turn it into a shelter for victims of forced marriage. This place can be a safe haven for victims after they have escaped and will help them get on their own path to success and freedom. I will use mostly donations to furnish the house and might need around $2000 for phone lines and computers. These are just rough estimates.<br/><br/>I have many talents in graphic design but have recently discovered my passion for photography. I would like to sell my photographs to raise money for my nonprofit. I can send you a signed print in any size with a story of where the photo was taken. Per your request, I can also frame your photos and send them to you framed and ready to be displayed. Each photo will be endorsed by SP photography.<br/><br/>Ideally, I want to help victims of forced marriage start their life from the beginning and not feel hurt and alone.</p>

<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My project will be a valuable contributor to the world because not a lot of nonprofits provide services to victims of forced marriage. It is an issue that is not talked about enough. It is something I have learned about in my culture and know people that have gone through a similar experience.<br/><br/>I work in the field of domestic and sexual violence prevention, so I strongly believe that a collective voice makes a difference and small contributions go a long way.

I'm Renee Bates, the owner and founder of Viva La Muerte! For the past three years I have been making organic, all natural bath and beauty products as a hobby for friends and family. Last year I decided that I wanted to start my own business crafting these wonderful, skin benefiting products so that I could share my passion for living a more healthy, eco-friendly life with the rest of the world. <br/>Starting a small business has been a slow process so far. I had to put my ideas on hold for a few months due to living in between America and Great Britain, getting married to the love of my life, and not being able to work in case it may violate any visa laws. <br/>At the moment I am back in America for the final stages of living with my husband permanently. <br/><br/><b>What is Viva La Muerte! about?</b></p><p>Viva La Muerte! is inspired by a need for self expression and a need to feel closer to my heritage. The painted sugar skulls are a link to who I am, a person who cannot ignore the need to create something but also doesn't want to let go of tradition. When I'm feeling a bit homesick for Texas I can rely on working on these bath bombs which help me feel closer to my friends and family that I've had to leave behind. <br/><br/>I first began making these sugar skull bath bombs at the end of last year. Why bath bombs? I love everything about them! I enjoy taking the time to treat myself to a bath and bath bombs add a delightful experience. Bath bombs are also a convenient way to add skin moisturizing oils and other ingredients to your bath without taking a long time to prep beforehand. All you have to do is put one bath bomb into your drawn bath and let it fizz! <br/>What I enjoy most about making these bath bombs is adding dried flowers and painting them by hand! It is a different approach to a common product which makes my sugar skull bath bombs unique. <br/><br/><b>What I've done for Viva La Muerte so far: </b></p><p>Other than creating and designing these sugar skull bath bombs, I have been embracing my strong D.I.Y. ethics to bring Viva La Muerte! to everyone else. <br/></p><ul>

</h3>I have been trying to retire for five years but love
teaching too much to give it up. However, I will, unless my wife retires, we
buy an RV and build a classroom trailer to travel throughout the 50 states,
even Hawaii. I have been teaching Silversmithing and Lost Wax Casting for
nearly 40 years and at the age of 68 (on April 20) I am just too old to be
driving around by myself. I have taught in all but 5 states in the past 5 years.
As I traveled to teach I found myself wanting to see things, do things and
experience things, but passed the opportunities up because my wife was not with
me. So, I just taught, ate, and went to the motel rooms in all 50 states in the
past 5 years without really seeing any of them. Now, I want to visit all 50
states again with her before we are too old to do it!<p></p>
<p>She will retire, and travel with me, if we have a “big” RV,
in her words, for a comfortable house on wheels, that she can live in, while I am
teaching. We are shopping for it now. That will make her happy! I want to build
a classroom trailer large enough to teach up to five students at a time in an
air conditioned, heated, comfortable classroom. That will make me, and my students, happy! The plan will be put a new idea on my website for setting up class around all 50 states. Because I want to teach in all 50 states I will schedule a class for anyone that wants to learn Silversmithing, Lost Wax Casting, Sand Casting, Lapidary, glass
slumping (cab making), art and crafts as we travel. All anyone will have to do is decide on a private class or up to 6 students and we agree on a weekend. The more students the less expensive it will be for each.  Please consider helping us
fulfill this dream and check out the perks I have offered just for you and
this project. Some are just for fun, some will more than pay you back for your
help. If you ever wanted to learn any craft, as I have taught them all in
public schools, this is your chance to start learning.</p><p>The plan is to purchase an 8 foot by 14 foot trailer and build it in myself. I will include the floor plan. I will have an entry door in the back with plans to have a wheel chair ramp that slides out much like the ramp they use for rental trailers and trucks. As you walk in there will be a restroom on the right, refrigerator and microwave on the left. There will a large sink right after the refrigerator and a place for an ultra-sonic cleaner and tumblers next to the sink.  I will build six benches, three on each side of the trailer with my teaching desk in the middle just after the restroom. This is the way I built my classrooms in the past. It insures that the students have to turn away from their work and listen better while I am teaching. I will build in a six inch buffer on the right just before the benches. In the front of the trailer I will build in the kiln, vacuum caster and broken arm caster. The trailer will be heated and air conditioned too. I want it to be a class room that everyone will enjoy coming to and learning.<br/></p>
<p>I will be posting photos on my web site, learnsilver.com as
we shop for the RV, trailer, and start building the classroom. I want to
purchase all new equipment and tools for this new classroom and then let you
come in and use it while parked at your house, business, campground, or even a Wal-Mart! Check out the perks that I have offered for your backing of this project, especially the private classes at your home. I am sure you will find one that will fit your needs. <br/></p></div>","Classroom on Wheels, a Teaching Trailer

<p>John James Audubon’s artistically stunning, scientifically
accurate depiction of birds awakened generations of Americans to the intrinsic
value of nature. The 435 life-size images drawn by J.J. Audubon for “The
Birds of America”, the largest book printed in the 19th century, invite people

connection between humanity and the beating wings above.  </p>
<p>It is hard to imagine that some of the birds Audubon painted have become
modern dinosaurs, among them the passenger pigeon. Billions of them filled the
skies when 18-year old John James Audubon arrived at Mill Grove in 1803. Within
his lifetime, the population would markedly decline, and by 1914, the very last
of their kind, would die in an Ohio zoo. </p>
<p>Sculptor Todd McGrain has reflected on the extinction of
the Passenger Pigeon, Heath Hen, Carolina Parakeet, Great Auk and Labrador Duck
through the creation of five human-sized sculptures. His “Lost Bird Project”
placed the original pieces in communities where the birds were last seen in the
wild. Mr. McGrain will be honored with the <em><strong>John James Audubon Award for Art Inspiring
Conservation</strong></em> on April 26<sup>th</sup> for his efforts to focus attention on the
frailty of even the most common species. According to McGrain, “Forgetting is
another kinds of extinction.”</p>

lost forever. </p>

This year's installation will abstract even further away from the original, presenting a visual feast while riffing on topics like Infinity, The Coming Technological Singularity, Immortality (through technology), modern Spiritualism and THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT!</span></p>

Additionally, the construction demands of Nativity 3.0 will require more raw materials and more time spent building. Lights will again be a key feature and are costly as well.  In order to make this year’s installation possible, we will absolutely need the help of generous and passionate contributors. This project is part of a trajectory that is three years in the making, and one predicated on the hard work and dedication of a growing pool of talented artists and individuals working for the love of their craft in order to provide a community experience that runs for a week and remains FREE-OF-CHARGE.  Please help support the Xhurch in its most ambitious effort to date and join in the fun (and surprise) of another amazing nativity creation. </span></p>

Planned in conjunction with Seattle's reputed Hair and Space Museum, Nativity 3.0 promises to ""top out"" in both conceptual scope and visual splendor. In 2010, Xhurch staged a quaint and traditional Christmas Nativity which drew friends and a few neighbors. Last year, Alien Nativity attracted hundreds of visitors and garnered international media attention with its kitsch extra-terrestrial motif. This year's installation will abstract even further away from the original, presenting a visual feast while riffing on topics like Infinity, The Coming Technological Singularity, Immortality (through technology), modern Spiritualism and THE END OF THE WORLD AS WE KNOW IT!
 
Xhurch Nativity History
Following the transformation of a former NE Portland church in 2010 into the arts venue known as Xhurch, a first nativity was staged that December—a “traditional,” LIVE nativity, featuring human stand-ins, papier mache animals, hot cocoa, classic Christmas music, and a porcelain Jesus...
 
In 2011, Alien Nativity traded out 3 wise men for 4 alien magi, a shaman Santa Claus, and a mysterious mirror manger. The exhibit was a great success, with international press coverage, hundreds of visitors, and some surprisingly touching responses. 
 
Now, in a continued effort to provide an exciting experience for visitors while challenging holiday convention (and our own ingenuity), Nativity 3.0 is set to dazzle audiences again in 2012.     
 
Your contribution
Whereas last year’s Alien Nativity was funded in part by generous donations, and on a shoestring budget, this year’s will require a greater investment in technology and hi-tech mediums, some of which are proprietary and therefore costly. Additionally, the construction demands of Nativity 3.0 will require more raw materials and more time spent building. Lights will again be a key feature and are costly as well.  In order to make this year’s installation possible, we will absolutely need the help of generous and passionate contributors. This project is part of a trajectory that is three years in the making, and one predicated on the hard work and dedication of a growing pool of talented artists and individuals working for the love of their craft in order to provide a community experience that runs for a week and remains FREE-OF-CHARGE.  Please help support the Xhurch in its most ambitious effort to date and join in the fun (and surprise) of another amazing nativity creation. 
 
Other ways to help
Unable to make a monetary donation? Nativity 3.0 could still use your help in the form of material and time donations. Please refer to our project website to see a current list of needed supplies, and don’t hesitate to get in touch with any other ideas for contributing. We also love the simple help afforded us by word of mouth - please pass our fundraising campaign on to your friends, family and coworkers, and promote the Nativity 3.0 exhibition dates as well (December 21-25)!
 
Tax-Deductible Donations
Interested in making a tax-deductable donation? We have an option for this. Xhurch is not a 501(c)(3) but we do have an umbrella sponsor ready to accept checks. Contact info@xhurch.net for more info.
 
About the artists
Xhurch is an interdisciplinary arts venue/community place operated by artist Matt Henderson. Since 2010, it has been a fertile ground for lectures, artist residencies, art installations, movie screenings, experimental spiritual services, and more. 
Hair and Space Museum is the Seattle-based artist/musician duo Emily Pothast and David Golightly (co-founders of band Midday Veil), whose site-specific multimedia installations serve as meditations on the generative, cosmic properties of sound.

My name is Troy and I’m a community organizer, and supporter of Claude the Dragon.  I am helping the creator of Claude the Dragon, Gabe Zanotto, and Dragon Ass Camp raise funds to get Claude to BRC!  
Claude the Dragon has an amazingly rich history that truly embodies the Burning Man culture and has been inspiring viewers for over 25 years (over 500 shows)!  Claude is a must-see, in “person” to understand the life-energy that he carries  which many attribute to the hundreds of unique parts he is made of.  He is 22ft long, breaths fire - you can even climb into the belly and move his head yourself  (trust us, it's way more fun than that description sounds!).  We can’t possibly share everything about Claude here, so please follow him on Facebook to learn more about his heart-warming past!
What We Need & What You Get

Our Goal is to raise $6000 to cover repairs for the truck that transports Claude.  Repairs include windshield replacement, emergency brake repairs, and transmission repair.  


We have been quoted at $5000 to cover the repairs.  The truck we are repairing is a tow-truck style vehicle; the transmission work is what makes it expensive.  


$200 (4%) will go to Indiegogo for the use of their wonderful platform

$800 will cover the campaign cost

Perks

We will present a special lighting ceremony at the burn in honor of contributors.  The ceremony and performance by special guests (TBA) will begin at 8:30pm, Thursday at Dragon Ass Camp (Please check guide; we intend to setup near 2:30 and D).  


If we do not reach our full goal, 100% of what is raised still go towards repairs of the vehicle 


The Impact
Contributions are going towards a much bigger picture beyond just getting Claude to The Burn this year.  It has become increasingly difficult to transport him as our truck has been breaking down over the years and we are now at a point where we simply cannot transport Claude until these repairs are made.  By repairing the truck, we can continue to share the joy of Claude at schools, renaissance fairs, festivals, BRC and more.

Hello,
we are David and Nicolas and we are Studio Twin Games. We are two passionate of
Fantasy, figurines and games. We are pleased to introduce you Twecoalk, an amazing univers.Qui sommes-nous?
Bonjour, nous sommes David
et Nicolas et nous sommes Studio Twin Games. Nous sommes deux passionnés de Fantasy,
de figurines et de jeux. Nous avons le plaisir de vous présenter Twecoalk, un univers riche et surprenant.Why this Indiegogo ?

Because we need you!
Developing  a
range of figurines means substantial costs caused by sculpture, molding,
illustration or communication investments. If these costs are easy to cover by
large companies, young companies such as Studio Twin Games need the help of
passionate people.
We intend to propose an original range with quality
sculptures and casts. Your input will help us to fund the beautiful concepts of
illustrator, as well as the sculpture of 5 figurines: Pulvun band.
Your support, will show us that Twecoalk has a future,
as a world and as a range. The Pulvun band and the Walren are only a start,
because  Studio Twin Games is full of
ideas and projects, for figurines, boardgames or wargames. Your Support constitutes
the first stone of Twecoalk, which I hope will grow with and for its fans. Each
of your contributions will be of great help for the building of Twecoalk world!
Help us to give birth to Twecoalk people!

Pourquoi cet Indiegogo ?

Parce que nous
avons besoin de vous !
Développer une
gamme de figurine entraîne des investissements importants pour le design, la sculpture,
le moulage et la communication. Si ces
investissements sont faciles pour les grandes entreprises, les jeunes
entreprises comme Studio Twin Games ont besoin de l’aide des passionnés.
Nous sommes
désireux de proposer une gamme originale avec des sculptures et des moulages de
qualité. Votre contribution nous aidera à financer les magnifiques concepts de
notre illustratrice, ainsi que la sculpture de 5 figurines : le groupe des
Pulvun.
Votre soutien nous indiquera que Twecoalk a un
avenir, que ce soit comme univers ou comme gamme. Les Pulvun et le Walren ne
sont qu’un début, car Studio Twin Games a plein d’idées et de projets :
Figurines, Jeux de plateaux ou Wargames. Votre soutien constitue la première
pierre de l’édifice Twecoalk qui nous l’espérons grandira avec et pour ses
passionnés. Chacune de vos contributions sera une aide formidable pour la
construction de cet univers !

Aidez-nous à faire vivre les peuples de Twecoalk !
What will be developed with this indiegogo ?

The
purpose of this indiegogo is to finance and support the sculpture and the
design of five Pulvun’s musician as well as many accessories and special
figurines.
We
will assure finance of the resine cast.
We
intend to implement our range in medium-term in the shops near you. A pledge to
the shop is also open in this direction.
In
addition, we count on you to share with us your opinions, wish, envy on the
current project and following of Twecoalk. You are the players in the creation
of this world!

<p>The Morgan Adams Foundation (pediatric cancer research)...</p>

<p>Morgan Adams does an event that both Amanda and I have contributed artwork to, called ARTMA, it's an art auction aimed to raise money for pediatric cancer research.  We thought with Beautiful Times we could go a step beyond our usual donation and do this murals tour.</p>
<p>The Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center...neither of us has ever worked with them before, but the cause is noble and we're both sorta mega into the theme right now. Plus, Mando is a true green thumb.  </p>
<p>That's the bones of the idea.  We want to do a cool tour and we want it to benefit some worthy causes.  We've got good walls and project places lined up in Denver, Boulder, Philadelphia, Beacon, and NYC.  We've got great allies in all those places. The project site is: beautifultimes.net</p>

<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What is in it for you, What is in it for us?</h3> <p>Well for you...basically we've got some perk tiers, and they range from $20 for a screen printed postcard and a generous thanks to $650 for an original Amanda Marie painting on paper.  </p>

<p>Here is how we see it breaking down...We want to do 7 or 8 mural / installation projects on our 3.5 week trip, all along the way we will be documenting the project with video and pics and building awareness for the causes we are supporting.</p>
<p>But being realistic, it's gonna cost a sizable chunk of the pledges towards the total goal just to do the projects...travel, accommodations (though mostly we'll be couch surfing and vanpiring) , food, paint, tools, mural making supplies...it all adds up.  </p>
<p>In the end we hope we can reach our goal to donate $7000 to $12, 000 to each of the charities.  </p>

</div> <div> <h3>Why Why Why?</h3> <p>We're going to go out and do this project anyway, it's fun stuff, it's Beautiful Times. We are going on a road trip and we're gonna make art.  The point is, we can do this in a way that benefits some other people, some deserving people.  You know, Street Art, Urban Art, Graffiti...it's got a strange vibe in a lot of people's minds...which is fine...totally fine.  But, we want to show what a strong community can do behind a couple of artists that have positive goals with worthy causes in mind. </p>
<p>I've been working on big good projects for a long time and we always seem to make them work.  We hosted the Manifest Hope show at the Democratic National Convention when Obama was trying to get elected the first time in 2008.  Last year we worked with the Dutch Consulate in New York to bring 20 artists together in Miami for an amazing mural project called Caleidoscoop.  Beautiful Times is just the latest in a chain of positive projects that stretches back more than 15 years.  </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I'm a little nervous about bringing our vision outside of our normal realm of our regular 'street art' community.  We're going to be working with urban farmers and gardeners and all kinds of folks we might at first feel a bit estranged to.  Amanda grew up on a farm so she'll get in the swing soon enough, and I've worked in all kinds of places from dishpits to the north slope oil fields, from hockey rinks to ice cream shops...I'm pretty sure I can settle into a groove with almost any kind of person, but it is a bit 'off compass' for us...and that's part of the challenge and fun.  I just hope they like what we make.</p>
<p>The other big challenge is emotional and creative exhaustion.  By the time we get done in New York...one of the cities that we must truly kick ass for...we're either going to be totally wiped out or totally in the groove.  All we can do is hope that it's the latter.  </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Help us spread the word and point people to this indiegogo campaign.  We have a cool lil project and it's just what it says it is 'Beautiful Times'  .  As we work on this project and we make it succeed,  it then becomes an inspiring example for other artists who want to hit the road and do it in support of their own ideas of something good and beautiful.  </p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My name is Candace Nyaomi, I am an artist and photographer entering my final year at OCAD University.</span><br/></p>
<p>For the past five years I’ve been focusing on perfecting my craft. Exploring many different mediums I've dabbled in portraiture, concerts, weddings, sports and product photography. </p>

<p></p>
<p>This past school year I’ve been taking on new challenges with my photo based work by experimenting with text, image, textiles and fabrics. Although in past exhibits I’ve created social and political photography, I enjoyed the process of transforming my images and texts into patterns so much I wanted to continue with this new approach for the NS Photo Exchange Project.</p>

<b>NS Photo Exchange Project</b><br/>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">NS is an online photographic exchange project between Gallery 44
Centre for Contemporary Photography (Toronto, Canada) and PH15 Foundation (Buenos
Aires, Argentina) and OCAD University (Toronto, Canada). It
was commissioned by the TORONTO 2015 arts and culture festival PANAMANIA,
presented by CIBC and is also a proud IGNITE community partner. Six
photographers from Toronto have been paired with six photographers from Buenos
Aires to create photo-based projects exploring connections
between and within different places that are oceans apart. More
information can be found on our website at </span><a href=""http://nsphotoproject.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>http://nsphotoproject.com</b></a><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">. The show

<p></p>
<p>Together my partner Luján Augusti &amp; I  collectively realized that our niche was text, image and fabric, making it the simple choice for our final assignment. The only setback we've encountered has been that printing on fabrics can be quite costly.</p>
<p>Looking to supplement costs we are calling on you for your support. We want to be experimental with our project &amp; being hindered by such a short goal will not stifle our creativity.</p>
<p>This is my first international show and I can’t
put into words what it would mean for me to be at the show opening in Argentina.
Quitting my job to focus on my career as a photographer &amp; full time student
has had its lows, but opportunities like this make it worthwhile. </p>

</u></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Argentina $2000</span></p>
<p><u>Print Expenses</u>:</p>
<p>$1000 Allows for us to print different
sizes and fabrics, </p>
<p>$500 budget each would allow for us to
have a little more flexibility to use whatever material we desire.</p>
<p><u>Food and Transportation in
Argentina</u>: $300</p>
<p><u>Contingency Funds &amp; Fees</u>: $600</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the unlikely event we cannot make our goal, the funds would first go into printing the work. </p>

</div></div>","My name is Candace Nyaomi, I am an artist and photographer entering my final year at OCAD University.
For the past five years I’ve been focusing on perfecting my craft. Exploring many different mediums I've dabbled in portraiture, concerts, weddings, sports and product photography. 






This past school year I’ve been taking on new challenges with my photo based work by experimenting with text, image, textiles and fabrics. Although in past exhibits I’ve created social and political photography, I enjoyed the process of transforming my images and texts into patterns so much I wanted to continue with this new approach for the NS Photo Exchange Project.



NS Photo Exchange Project
NS is an online photographic exchange project between Gallery 44
Centre for Contemporary Photography (Toronto, Canada) and PH15 Foundation (Buenos
Aires, Argentina) and OCAD University (Toronto, Canada). It
was commissioned by the TORONTO 2015 arts and culture festival PANAMANIA,
presented by CIBC and is also a proud IGNITE community partner. Six
photographers from Toronto have been paired with six photographers from Buenos
Aires to create photo-based projects exploring connections
between and within different places that are oceans apart. More
information can be found on our website at http://nsphotoproject.com. The show
will be in Toronto July 17th – August 1st and August
29th – September 9th in Buenos Aires.


Together my partner Luján Augusti & I  collectively realized that our niche was text, image and fabric, making it the simple choice for our final assignment. The only setback we've encountered has been that printing on fabrics can be quite costly.
Looking to supplement costs we are calling on you for your support. We want to be experimental with our project & being hindered by such a short goal will not stifle our creativity.
This is my first international show and I can’t
put into words what it would mean for me to be at the show opening in Argentina.
Quitting my job to focus on my career as a photographer & full time student
has had its lows, but opportunities like this make it worthwhile. 
  


What I Need


Travel expenses:
Argentina $2000
Print Expenses:
$1000 Allows for us to print different
sizes and fabrics, 
$500 budget each would allow for us to
have a little more flexibility to use whatever material we desire.
Food and Transportation in
Argentina: $300
Contingency Funds & Fees: $600

In the unlikely event we cannot make our goal, the funds would first go into printing the work. 
Any additional funding would go towards covering airfare to Argentina.



Risks & Challenges  

Our biggest risk/concern is funding & time. If we are unable to reach the goal we will either look into another way to fund the project or modify accordingly. 
I’ve had my share of risks and challenges planning group shows and exhibitions over the last couple years. From the initial shooting, to printing, to the installation, I’ve learned to always be prepared for unexpected obstacles and remain open minded. I will go into this project with the same mind state. My experiences have taught me not to panic. Instead take a breath, figure out a solution and act on it.

<p>This September, we
want to launch a historic Portal between San Francisco and Herat, Afghanistan,
Havana, Cuba and Tehran, Iran. </p>
<p>Join us!</p>
<p><i>Portals </i>are gold shipping containers with immersive
audio-visual equipment inside. When you enter one, you come face-to-face with
someone in another container live, full-body, and the two of you converse as if
in the same room with real-time translation. As many participants have put it,
“you feel as though you’re breathing the same air.” </p>
<p>Since December
2014, more than 2,500 people have engaged in 20-minute conversations about
daily life with distant strangers. They have come out deeply moved -- giddy,
weeping, and everything in between. As one participant put it after performing
live for his family in Tehran for the first time:</p>
<p><i>Life has thrown me
a gift...wrapped in a gold shipping crate. I have been given the opportunity to
laugh, dance and stand face to face for the first time in my life with my
family in Tehran, Iran. I felt as though we were breathing the same air....The
potential to bridge the gap between unlikely spaces, people and time with this
project is remarkable!</i></p>
<p>In addition,
artists collaborated together -- painters, musicians, poets and actors. Special
guests like documentary filmmaker Morgan Spurlock gave advice to students in
Tehran and talked shop with their peers. Entrepreneurs traded ideas. And sixth
graders in the U.S. asked university students in Tehran about what their
schooling was like.</p>

<p><b>Why?</b></p>
<p>Fiercely exclusionary group identities are thriving in the
21st century, from religious intolerance to racial and sexuality-based bigotry.
If we do not meaningfully engage with people from different walks of life, our
capacity for empathy weakens and divisions of class, race, and identity deepen.</p>
<p>And while new technologies allow us to connect across
boundaries as never before, we too often use them to insulate ourselves in our
own communities. Online behaviors such as Liking, Tweeting, or Posting rarely
encourage us to engage directly with individuals far outside our existing group
affiliations.</p>
<p>By conversing through a <i>Portal</i>, participants
step out of their daily routines and their comfort zones. Away from the
distraction of cell phones and their peers, people swiftly connect across
distances, real and imagined. They share a quiet moment. In these encounters,
people learn about the “other” and challenge their own values, beliefs, and
assumptions.</p>
<p>We aim to create a
global network of interconnected <i>Portals</i> around the world –
from big cities to small towns, rich and poor, urban and remote. We envision
these <i>Portals </i>providing room for global conversation and
collaboration across all forms of distance. We want <i>Portals </i>to
become the world's arts and community center. And we want Silicon Valley to be
one of its founding hubs.</p>
<p><b>What

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Pour moi, c'est l'accueil d'un renouveau dans mon œuvre car je me sens plus affranchie que jamais! J'admets qu'une certaine nervosité me gagne aussi... ça fait un bout de temps quand même que je ne me suis pas penchée sur une série de tableaux! Je me sens un peu comme une néophyte et c'est ce qui est le plus admirable et le plus encourageant dans ce projet je trouve :  j'ai confiance de recouvrer une certaine fraîcheur dans mes nouveaux paysages.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>* * *</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">En 2015, après avoir mené de front une carrière artistique et des études soutenues en arts visuels pendant de nombreuse années, j'ai fait le choix d'arrêter la peinture. En réalité, je voulais faire l'expérience de renvoyer dans mon inconscient tout ce que           j'avais appris et absorbé, pour lui demander de revenir, en temps et lieu, dans son plus simple apparat.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Je suis donc partie en arctique, là où seul l'horizon délimite le ciel et la terre.  L'interruption est ainsi devenu un moment crucial de mon processus plastique, où l’exploration du vide est devenu comme un potentiel, quelque chose qui attend patiemment d'être occupé, et par extension, d'être réalisé. C'est cet espace      - <i>particulièrement disponible - </i>qui veut se déployer dans ma peinture aujourd'hui.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1545062511/ji8sooraejstjmcw9ay6.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>La Ville de Coaticook m'offre un atelier-résidence où je pourrai me concentrer sur mon œuvre de janvier à mars.  Le comité de sélection favorisait l'artiste qui démontrait un intérêt marqué pour la communication, qui aime travailler avec le public et qui souhaite s'intégrer à la vie culturelle locale. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Le paysage sera le sujet de ma recherche. Je m'intéresserai donc au lieu dans lequel je me trouve, mais surtout, aux personnes qui y habitent. Dans le cadre d'une pratique artistique où ma relation à l'autre actionne le propos du tableau, je m'en vais tisser des liens et oeuvrer auprès des personnes âgées de cette région.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Cette campagne de socio-financement devient un véritable atout pour la réussite de ce projet et votre contribution est plus qu'importante pour moi. À vrai dire, bien que le studio soit fourni, aucune allocation de subsistance n'est allouée à l'artiste pendant son séjour. Il va sans dire qu'un minimum de frais sont donc à prévoir!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Votre appui financier me permettra carrément de me nourrir, d'acheter du matériel artistique et surtout, de m'accorder une certaine tranquillité d'esprit, indispensable à une saine créativité.</p>

Enfin, vous offrez un élan à ma créativité. Vous êtes un moteur dans ce projet et je suis consciente du privilège que vous m'octroyer.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>!MERCI!</strong></p>
<h3>Ce dont j'ai besoin et ce que vous obtenez :</h3>
<p>Pour que mon projet de résidence et ma campagne de socio-financement soient réalistes et transparents, j'ai fait l'exercice d'un <strong>budget</strong> formel et je vous offre des <strong>""perks""</strong> généreux pour honorer vos donations. (voir juste ici, en dessous)</p>
<h3>C'est quoi des ""Perks""?</h3>
<p>C'est ma façon de vous redonner quelque chose pour vous remercier de votre appui à mon projet! ""Perks"" est un mot anglais qui signifie ""avantages"", ou mieux, ce que vous gagnez en me soutenant : </p>
<p><strong>​PERK de 50 $</strong></p>
<p><strong>​​</strong>Un GROS merci! Tu recevras 4 cartes de voeux avec l'image de 4 oeuvres différentes, réalisées sur place. Je te donnerai de mes nouvelles tout au long de ma résidence en te faisant parvenir 6 info-lettres. De plus, je t'invite à mon studio pendant la relâche.</p>
<p><strong>PERK de 200 $</strong></p>
<p>Pleine gratitude! Tu recevras un petit tableau original crée pendant ma résidence et 4 cartes de vœux. Je t'enverrai les info-lettres et tu es invité à participer aux activités de la semaine de relâche à Coaticook.</p>
<p><strong>PERK de 500$ </strong></p>
<p>Je suis si reconnaissante de ce que tu fais pour moi! Je te donnerai une œuvre de grand format réalisée ici pendant les 3 mois de ma résidence. Tu recevras 4 cartes de voeux avec l'image de 4 oeuvres différentes. Je te donnerai de mes nouvelles en t'envoyant 6 info-lettres et je t'invite bien sûr à l'atelier de Coaticook pendant la relâche (horaire à venir).</p>
<p><strong>PERK de 1000$</strong></p>
<p>WOW! Tu es un réel défenseur des arts et tu me permets de développer mon travail comme jamais!  Je te propose de me rencontrer pour évaluer ce que tu veux comme œuvre originale. Nous déciderons des dimensions, des thèmes et même de la palette de couleur souhaitée. En mi-travail tu me donneras tes commentaires et une approbation pour la poursuite du travail. Tu recevras 4 cartes de voeux. Je te donnerai de mes nouvelles par le biais des info-lettres et je t'invite à l'atelier de Coaticook!</p>
<h3>Y a-t-il d'autres façons de m'aider ? OUI!</h3>
<p>Soutenez-moi en partageant mon projet sur vos réseaux sociaux et en parlant de moi à vos ami.es! Avec Indiegogo c'est très simple de partager ma cause!</p>

<h3>Pourquoi ai-je choisi une plateforme en anglais?</h3>
<p>J'ai choisi Indiegogo car c'est la seule plateforme qui propose un financement flexible. C'est-à-dire que si je n'atteins pas <strong><u>mon objectif de 2935 $</u> </strong>(je l'espère!) je pourrai recevoir le montant amassé <i>(contrairement à un type de campagne ""tout-ou-rien"" comme la plate-forme La Ruche par exemple)</i>. C'est ma première expérience de socio-financement, alors je préfère faire appel à quelque chose de plus stable. N'hésitez surtout pas à communiquer directement avec moi si vous avez des questions à propos du fonctionnement sécuritaire d'Indiegogo ou consultez leur site.</p>

<p>Diplômée en Muséologie, Véronique Tifo est bachelière de l'Université Concordia (B.F.A. - 2005) et termine des études supérieures en Art-Thérapie en 2010 (D.E.S. - U.Q.A.T). De 2005 à 2012, elle fonde et dirige Ŭtĕrum, École de Peinture Actuelle, où sa prémisse est de mettre en valeur l’individualité artistique de chacun de ses étudiants. Après sa maîtrise en Arts visuels et médiatiques (UQAM, 2015)  l'artiste quitte son atelier de Montréal pour oeuvrer au sein du Great Northern Arts Festival à Inuvik. En 2017, elle est invitée à bord de l'équipage de Canada C3. Le voyage de 20 jours en brise-glace fait un tour complet de L’Alaska et lui permet d’explorer le carnet de voyage, inspiré de l’aspect narratif des <i>qimiqrunguaq</i> (dessins Inuits). En 2019, Véronique Tifo se joint à l'équipe du MAC Laurentides pour y oeuvrer en muséologie.</p>

Ça y est! Ma valise est pleine, ma peinture est dans la voiture et Muse me suit partout pour faire sûr que je ne l'oublie pas! Je me sens tellement excitée à l'idée de me concentrer exclusivement sur ma peinture pendant les 3 prochains mois, quelle belle façon d’entreprendre une année n'est-ce pas!?

Pour moi, c'est l'accueil d'un renouveau dans mon œuvre car je me sens plus affranchie que jamais! J'admets qu'une certaine nervosité me gagne aussi... ça fait un bout de temps quand même que je ne me suis pas penchée sur une série de tableaux! Je me sens un peu comme une néophyte et c'est ce qui est le plus admirable et le plus encourageant dans ce projet je trouve :  j'ai confiance de recouvrer une certaine fraîcheur dans mes nouveaux paysages.
* * *
En 2015, après avoir mené de front une carrière artistique et des études soutenues en arts visuels pendant de nombreuse années, j'ai fait le choix d'arrêter la peinture. En réalité, je voulais faire l'expérience de renvoyer dans mon inconscient tout ce que           j'avais appris et absorbé, pour lui demander de revenir, en temps et lieu, dans son plus simple apparat.
Je suis donc partie en arctique, là où seul l'horizon délimite le ciel et la terre.  L'interruption est ainsi devenu un moment crucial de mon processus plastique, où l’exploration du vide est devenu comme un potentiel, quelque chose qui attend patiemment d'être occupé, et par extension, d'être réalisé. C'est cet espace      - particulièrement disponible - qui veut se déployer dans ma peinture aujourd'hui.
La Ville de Coaticook m'offre un atelier-résidence où je pourrai me concentrer sur mon œuvre de janvier à mars.  Le comité de sélection favorisait l'artiste qui démontrait un intérêt marqué pour la communication, qui aime travailler avec le public et qui souhaite s'intégrer à la vie culturelle locale. 
Le paysage sera le sujet de ma recherche. Je m'intéresserai donc au lieu dans lequel je me trouve, mais surtout, aux personnes qui y habitent. Dans le cadre d'une pratique artistique où ma relation à l'autre actionne le propos du tableau, je m'en vais tisser des liens et oeuvrer auprès des personnes âgées de cette région.
Cette campagne de socio-financement devient un véritable atout pour la réussite de ce projet et votre contribution est plus qu'importante pour moi. À vrai dire, bien que le studio soit fourni, aucune allocation de subsistance n'est allouée à l'artiste pendant son séjour. Il va sans dire qu'un minimum de frais sont donc à prévoir!
Votre appui financier me permettra carrément de me nourrir, d'acheter du matériel artistique et surtout, de m'accorder une certaine tranquillité d'esprit, indispensable à une saine créativité.

Votre impact sur mon projet :
Je ne saurais + vous démontrer à quel point votre soutien financier est déterminant ! Votre appui me donne les moyens d'acheter le matériel artistique dont j'ai besoin. Également, vous m'appuyez dans ma volonté de communiquer avec les personnes âgées au moyen de l'art. Enfin, vous offrez un élan à ma créativité. Vous êtes un moteur dans ce projet et je suis consciente du privilège que vous m'octroyer.
!MERCI!
Ce dont j'ai besoin et ce que vous obtenez :
Pour que mon projet de résidence et ma campagne de socio-financement soient réalistes et transparents, j'ai fait l'exercice d'un budget formel et je vous offre des ""perks"" généreux pour honorer vos donations. (voir juste ici, en dessous)
C'est quoi des ""Perks""?
C'est ma façon de vous redonner quelque chose pour vous remercier de votre appui à mon projet! ""Perks"" est un mot anglais qui signifie ""avantages"", ou mieux, ce que vous gagnez en me soutenant : 
​PERK de 50 $
​​Un GROS merci! Tu recevras 4 cartes de voeux avec l'image de 4 oeuvres différentes, réalisées sur place. Je te donnerai de mes nouvelles tout au long de ma résidence en te faisant parvenir 6 info-lettres. De plus, je t'invite à mon studio pendant la relâche.
PERK de 200 $
Pleine gratitude! Tu recevras un petit tableau original crée pendant ma résidence et 4 cartes de vœux. Je t'enverrai les info-lettres et tu es invité à participer aux activités de la semaine de relâche à Coaticook.
PERK de 500$ 
Je suis si reconnaissante de ce que tu fais pour moi! Je te donnerai une œuvre de grand format réalisée ici pendant les 3 mois de ma résidence. Tu recevras 4 cartes de voeux avec l'image de 4 oeuvres différentes. Je te donnerai de mes nouvelles en t'envoyant 6 info-lettres et je t'invite bien sûr à l'atelier de Coaticook pendant la relâche (horaire à venir).
PERK de 1000$
WOW! Tu es un réel défenseur des arts et tu me permets de développer mon travail comme jamais!  Je te propose de me rencontrer pour évaluer ce que tu veux comme œuvre originale. Nous déciderons des dimensions, des thèmes et même de la palette de couleur souhaitée. En mi-travail tu me donneras tes commentaires et une approbation pour la poursuite du travail. Tu recevras 4 cartes de voeux. Je te donnerai de mes nouvelles par le biais des info-lettres et je t'invite à l'atelier de Coaticook!
Y a-t-il d'autres façons de m'aider ? OUI!
Soutenez-moi en partageant mon projet sur vos réseaux sociaux et en parlant de moi à vos ami.es! Avec Indiegogo c'est très simple de partager ma cause!

Pourquoi ai-je choisi une plateforme en anglais?
J'ai choisi Indiegogo car c'est la seule plateforme qui propose un financement flexible. C'est-à-dire que si je n'atteins pas mon objectif de 2935 $ (je l'espère!) je pourrai recevoir le montant amassé (contrairement à un type de campagne ""tout-ou-rien"" comme la plate-forme La Ruche par exemple). C'est ma première expérience de socio-financement, alors je préfère faire appel à quelque chose de plus stable. N'hésitez surtout pas à communiquer directement avec moi si vous avez des questions à propos du fonctionnement sécuritaire d'Indiegogo ou consultez leur site.

Diplômée en Muséologie, Véronique Tifo est bachelière de l'Université Concordia (B.F.A. - 2005) et termine des études supérieures en Art-Thérapie en 2010 (D.E.S. - U.Q.A.T). De 2005 à 2012, elle fonde et dirige Ŭtĕrum, École de Peinture Actuelle, où sa prémisse est de mettre en valeur l’individualité artistique de chacun de ses étudiants. Après sa maîtrise en Arts visuels et médiatiques (UQAM, 2015)  l'artiste quitte son atelier de Montréal pour oeuvrer au sein du Great Northern Arts Festival à Inuvik. En 2017, elle est invitée à bord de l'équipage de Canada C3. Le voyage de 20 jours en brise-glace fait un tour complet de L’Alaska et lui permet d’explorer le carnet de voyage, inspiré de l’aspect narratif des qimiqrunguaq (dessins Inuits). En 2019, Véronique Tifo se joint à l'équipe du MAC Laurentides pour y oeuvrer en muséologie.

<h3>What is this ""mini-fest"" anyway? </h3>
<p>To complete my DMA, I have to do one more recital that showcases my artistry and interests. As an artist with a <a href=""http://www.hillaryjeanyoung.com/about/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">wide range of interests</a>, it became clear to me that I couldn't possibly encompass my work in one solo recital. ""queer time | two happenings on november 5th"" is meant to showcase my work as a performer, but also as a curator, producer, and facilitator. </p>
<p>The first event of the day, a 5pm recital at the Experimental Theatre at UCSD, features two works for voice and piano. Sharing the stage with long time collaborator Kyle Adam Blair, we will perform ""L'Ame en bourgeon"" (1937) by Claire Delbos. This eight song cycle is rarely performed; composed by Olivier Messiaen's first wife, these songs are settings of poems by Messiaen's mother, Cecile Sauvage. These songs are both deeply personal and tender, giving a voice to two brilliant women that history has hidden in the shadow of a powerful man. The second half of the recital features a world premiere; composer <a href=""http://justinmurphymancini.com/about.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Justin Murphy-Mancini</a> has set multidisciplinary artist <a href=""https://migueltzinta.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Miguelzinta Solis</a>'s poem, ""Pinterest Sex"" as a multi-movement monodrama. This work is a mix of camp and pastiche, and evokes the tragedy of the queer adolescent experience. I am so excited to show this piece to the world; Justin and Miguel are two of my best friends, and I feel incredibly honoured to be a part of this collaboration. </p>
<p>The second event of the day, an 8ish pm art party at the Che Cafe, features visual artists, performance artists, drag performers, musicians, and everyone in between. I am performing a set in this show with my bandmate Sadie Hochman, but I am also taking on the role of organizer and curator; this event is as much about the other artists and performers involved as it is about me. The guiding themes for this show are nostalgia, personal history, memory, and queer time. Featured artists include Grace Huddleston, Asa Mendelsohn, Lauren Jones, Joshua Moreno, Madison Greenstone, and others. Given that this event is taking place in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch%C3%A9_Caf%C3%A9"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">historic Che Cafe</a>, this is meant to be a community event that embraces the inclusive ideology of the Che; the space is accessible and all ages (the Che is a sober space), we will have vegan snacks and cold brew coffee, and cover is $2-$5 pay-what-you-want (no one turned away for lack of funds). </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>How can I help/why should I help?</h3>
<p>This campaign is trying to raise $500, but that is just the minimum that Indiegogo requires for a crowdfunding campaign; I actually only need about $400. This $400 would be used to cover several expenses so that I can give all the money made at the door back to my collaborators. Artists (and especially grad student artists) are often expected to work for free, which is both unethical and unsustainable. For example, during my time at UCSD, my institution has only paid me to sing once. I don't want to be a part of that problematic pattern; I may not be able to pay my collaborators much, but it is important to me that I be able to pay them something. The funds raised from this campaign would be used to cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Miguelzinta's flight (~$270). Miguel is currently pursuing an MFA in Lethbridge, Alberta, but it is very important to me that he be here for the premiere of the piece he co-wrote.</li>
<li>Food  and modest honoraria for kitchen and door volunteers and the Che (~$130)</li>
</ul>
<p>So what's in it for you? I am recording several of the pieces featured in these shows at the beginning of December; <strong>every person who donates $10 or more will receive a copy of this recording. </strong>This will be a professional quality recording done at UCSD's state of the art recording studios, consisting of approximately 60 minutes of music, including the above mentioned premiere.</p>
<p>For everyone who donates, you will have my undying gratitude, and the knowledge that you helped a bunch of artists actually make a living doing what they love. Even if you can't donate, I am planning on livestreaming at least the first show via Facebook, which you are all welcome to watch. </p>
<p>Thank you all for your help!</p>

This project aims to assemble a unique collection of the most outstanding artifacts made from plant raw material representing the extraordinary diversity of Human Cultures and Societies.</strong></p>
<h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
<p><strong>I am a biologist, with a PhD in Plant Taxonomy and Systematics (Ethnobotany), and also the founding-director of a Botanical Museum located in Beja (Portugal). Ever since I can remember, I had a passion for plants with an especially interest in the area that studies how Humans incorporate Plants into their culture.</strong></p>

<h3><strong>OUR GOAL</strong></h3>
<p><strong>With this campaign we intend to obtain funds to establish a world’s collection of artifacts made with plant raw materials that represents past and present human interactions with the Plant Kingdom and also a selection of natural objects (seeds, fruits, woods, etc.) that represents the amazing diversity of the plant’s world (as the coco-de-mer, <em>Lodoceia maldivica</em>, see head figure of this campaign which shows two coco-de-mer seeds). We are willing to obtain items from all contemporary human societies and cultures.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We believe that this campaign is very important because we can finally assemble, under one unique collection, some of the world’s ethnobiodiversity concerning the use of plants by Humans.</strong></p>

<h3><strong>THE COLLECTION</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The collection will be used to non-profit <em>pro bono</em> public education and a selection of item will be in permanent display in Lisbon, a multicultural city with strong historical and cultural links with plants, and temporary displays in New York. Besides these, the entire collection will be available in a free access website to promote the knowledge and the conservation of our ethno-ecological heritage and also increase the awareness concerning the artistic knowledge related with the wonderful objects that humans have created from plants raw materials.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We truly believe that this collection will increase the awareness for issues related with the safeguard of non-urban traditional knowledge, some of which is now facing cultural erosion or extinction.</strong></p>

This project aims to assemble a unique collection of the most outstanding artifacts made from plant raw material representing the extraordinary diversity of Human Cultures and Societies.
ABOUT ME
I am a biologist, with a PhD in Plant Taxonomy and Systematics (Ethnobotany), and also the founding-director of a Botanical Museum located in Beja (Portugal). Ever since I can remember, I had a passion for plants with an especially interest in the area that studies how Humans incorporate Plants into their culture.
Flowers made with fig wood (Ficus carica) from Azores Islands (Portugal). This art was traditionally made by nuns and when the convents were closed the tradition was kept by the local community.

OUR GOAL
With this campaign we intend to obtain funds to establish a world’s collection of artifacts made with plant raw materials that represents past and present human interactions with the Plant Kingdom and also a selection of natural objects (seeds, fruits, woods, etc.) that represents the amazing diversity of the plant’s world (as the coco-de-mer, Lodoceia maldivica, see head figure of this campaign which shows two coco-de-mer seeds). We are willing to obtain items from all contemporary human societies and cultures.
We believe that this campaign is very important because we can finally assemble, under one unique collection, some of the world’s ethnobiodiversity concerning the use of plants by Humans.
Basket made with cloves (Syzygium aromaticum) from Indonesia. Cloves are flower buds that did not have the opportunity to open because they were harvested in an early stage of flower development.

THE COLLECTION
The collection will be used to non-profit pro bono public education and a selection of item will be in permanent display in Lisbon, a multicultural city with strong historical and cultural links with plants, and temporary displays in New York. Besides these, the entire collection will be available in a free access website to promote the knowledge and the conservation of our ethno-ecological heritage and also increase the awareness concerning the artistic knowledge related with the wonderful objects that humans have created from plants raw materials.
We truly believe that this collection will increase the awareness for issues related with the safeguard of non-urban traditional knowledge, some of which is now facing cultural erosion or extinction.
Amber from the Baltic Sea is usually recollected at the beaches, especially after big sea storms. Baltic Countries has a long, rich and unique tradition of making jewels with amber, as this one from the Hermitage Museum workshops (Russia). Amber is a fossil resin that trees from several genus (Pinus sp. and others) produced millions of years ago.

THE ARTIFACTS
The objects included in the collection will be those that represent the ethnic groups or cultures who have created them, for example, the shirts made with pineapple fibers (Ananas comosus) from the Philippines, Australian aboriginal paintings made over eucalyptus bark (Eucalyptus sp.), indigo (Indigofera tinctoria) dyed fabrics from India and China; sculptures made with vegetable ivory (Phytelephas macrocarpa) from Ecuador; traditional palm baskets (Hyphaene thebaica) from Botswana; frankincense (Boswellia sacra) and myrrh (Commiphora myrrha) from Oman, and many thousands of other examples.
My academic and professional careers are based on ethnobotany (plants and people studies) and I have always nourished this project for the last twenty years. The contributors who decide to join us will be helping the genesis of a new world’s collection for perpetual public use and education.
All items shown in this page (and in the gallery) are already included in the future collection but I would like to increase its number in order to represent more people and human cultures from Earth as well as use them for scientific education (via web and exhibitions).
Vegetable ivory seed (Phytelephas macrocarpa) from Ecuador and UK Victorian sewing items made with vegetable ivory.

HOW MUCH DO WE NEED AND WHAT FOR
We need to obtain 250.000 USD to the following actions:
1. Assemble the collection, and keep it under the best conditions accordingly to contemporary museum standards (including preventive conservation measures).
2. Create and maintain a website with all the information obtained from our research (items and related data) in English and Portuguese.
3. Organize and maintain a selections of items for permanent display in Lisbon and New York.
4. Promote academic interdisciplinary research related with the collection.
If we are unable to reach our goal of funding, the money will be used to obtain items and maintain a web page related with ethnobotany.
We will begin working on this soon after the campaing ends (assembling the collection and design the new webpage). We are willing  to keep working on this perpetually with no date to end the activities, although the displays in Lisbon and New York should be ready in the fall of 2014.

<p><b>Dear Friends,</b></p>the reunion with a teenage friend from Afghanistan triggered my interest and engagement in Afghanistan three years ago. Like many other people, too, I knew nothing about Afghanistan, except what western media had been reporting through all phases of war and occupation. So I connected to Afghan people on facebook and started researching on music, film, people, language, landscape, and of course Art.<br/><p><br/>But I couldn't find anything useful on Afghan Art! I found mostly websites with dead links, broken images and outdated information.<br/><b>This had to change. The idea for KABUL ART PROJECT was born.</b> <br/><br/>When I received the first applications for the project and saw the strong and impressive artworks, I knew I was on the right track. <b>I fell in love with Contemporary Afghan Art.</b></p>
<p>After one and a half year of promoting Afghan Artists and building up Kabul Art Project with lots of love, work and passion, I hope we can take the next step together with the same commitment and enthusiasm!<br/><br/>Those of you who know me personally know already how much Kabul Art Project means to me.  <b>Thank you, dear friends and followers of KABUL ART PROJECT for your continuous support and encouragement. </b><br/><br/>Christina Hallmann-Baudys<br/><b>KABUL ART PROJECT</b><br/></p>

Like many other people, too, I knew nothing about Afghanistan, except what western media had been reporting through all phases of war and occupation. So I connected to Afghan people on facebook and started researching on music, film, people, language, landscape, and of course Art.But I couldn't find anything useful on Afghan Art! I found mostly websites with dead links, broken images and outdated information.This had to change. The idea for KABUL ART PROJECT was born. When I received the first applications for the project and saw the strong and impressive artworks, I knew I was on the right track. I fell in love with Contemporary Afghan Art.
After one and a half year of promoting Afghan Artists and building up Kabul Art Project with lots of love, work and passion, I hope we can take the next step together with the same commitment and enthusiasm!Those of you who know me personally know already how much Kabul Art Project means to me.  Thank you, dear friends and followers of KABUL ART PROJECT for your continuous support and encouragement. Christina Hallmann-BaudysKABUL ART PROJECT

A portfolio of the Contemporary Afghan Art of KABUL ART PROJECT, with words and comments by artists and experts.Catalogue details: 21 x 29,7 cm, 148 pages, hard cover, color printLanguage: English


to open our KAP Online Store Our Catalogue, the Artist Books, high quality Art Prints and Original Artworks will be available there in an easily accessable way. 


to shoot a KAP Documentary Movie that will portrait our artists, their work and the Afghan Artist scene.An experienced Afghan film team will visit the artists of KABUL ART PROJECT at their working places, studios or at home to speak about their art and life, their motivation and working conditions. Our artists will talk about their sources for inspiration and show us their favourite places. The viewer will get a private glimpse into the artists' world and the very young Contemporary Afghan art scene, that has been developing just within the past 12 years. The viewers will be introduced to an unknown side of Afghanistan and will be able to connect with the artists' lives and their experiences of being an artist through a lifetime at war.

to organize further KAP exhibitionsExhibitions, the connection to the real world! We have already exhibited 60 artworks by our artists (oil paintings, watercolor paintings and drawings) in Germany, and these artworks are meant to travel through Germany and Europe. We'd like to extend the exhibition to 100 pieces and organize some major KABUL ART PROJECT exhibitions in Germany, Italy, UK and more.Your support will help us with the transport, framing of the artworks, possible rents and helpers for at least two further exhibitions.


All of this will have a big impact to the presence and prominence of 
Afghan Art and Artists and will improve the way KABUL ART PROJECT can 
support and promote the Artists!We will reach much more people, who will see Afghanistan and its people with different eyes and who will hopefully be inspired, too. 



If we reach our funding goal, every supporter will get a free download of our documentary film, expected in May/June 2015!If we don't reach the goal, we will work in this order: 1. KAP Artist Books & Online Shop2. KAP Exhibitions3. KAP Documentary Film. 
Here are some of our perks! (Please see Perk details on the right side)A selection of artworks and other KABUL ART PROJECT images can be viewed here in the gallery, or on our website and facebook page



Art is Freedom.Contemporary Art from Afghanistan is very young. Until twelve years ago most of artistic work was prohibited by the Taliban regime under penalty of death. Contemporary Art had to be re-discovered by the new generation of Afghan artists. Supporting Afghan Art is not only a support to the artists, but it is an enrichment to everyone, who didn't know of it before.KABUL ART PROJECT wants to support Afghan artists on their way as 
much as possible. With your help we can walk step two of our mission.The Art, especially Contemporary Art, is still viewed with scepticism by the Afghan society, devalued, sometimes disrespected and the performing of Art may still pose a danger to the artists and their families. Within the last 18 months some of our artists experienced several cases of deliberate destruction of their artworks, even by government institutions such as the National Gallery in Kabul, and some artists were attacked and threatened by Taliban. 
KABUL ART PROJECT has supported and promoted talented Afghan artists since January 2013.We
 have become one of the most present platforms to connect Afghan Contemporary Artists to foreign media, exhibitors and private art 
collectors, or simply lovers of art, where Afghan art was greatly 
underrepresented before. We have exhibited original paintings 
and drawings by our 27 artists from Afghanistan in Germany with more exhibitions to 
come, and we promote their artworks on a daily basis through social 
media and our website. New contacts and connections are being made, 
foreign media and exhibitors reach out to our artists through us. Just through our 
website and facebook we could handle a good number of art sales from Afghanistan to 
Canada, the United States, Europe and inside Afghanistan.Now that we have built a solid community of art loving followers, we want to take the next step to reach a larger public. With your support we will be able to publish a series of Artist Books and our first Catalogue, shoot a Documentary Film portraying our artists, organize more Exhibitions in Europe and open our Online Store.

<h2>Who is HIM?</h2>
</div>
<p>Hello art enthusiasts, my name is Boden Him, a Studio Art grad from Cal State Long Beach. With a deep appreciation for the arts, I am launching my first solo exhibition themed around musicians and influential artists. The gallery will feature a comprehensive collection of oil paintings, charcoal portraits, digital and mixed media. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Why I'm here.</span></h3>
<p>I am one of those starving and malnourished artist. I am here to ask for your help in funding my first exhibit. Your contributions will help provide the necessary elements to bring this show to life. $1,500 needs to be raised by April 2. A portion of gallery sales will be donated to a local charity, Taryn's Hope 4 Life.</p>
<p>The proceeds will enable me to provide you with prints of my work, food, refreshments, prizes, and cover the cost of staging. </p>

<h3>What's the purpose?</h3>
<p>This project almost didn't happen. Over the years, I've been constantly urged by family and friends to assemble an art show. We finally kicked this event into fruition in December 2012. Little did I know of the harsh news that lied ahead that month. My whole design department got laid off. Soon after that, the original venue that was going to host the show had to be shut down. This was a plan heading in a bad direction. </p>
<p>Weeks after hearing about my misfortune, a group of friends reached out to me. The staff at Forever Ashbury/Movement offered their flagship store as a venue.</p>
<p>I've been truly fortunate to meet so many inspiring artists from all walks of life.  Their work has helped catapult my desire to create art over the years.  I've seen the impact it has made on people, and as a result, I know first hand that art has a great spot in people's lives.  This gathering will take place at the Forever Ashbury/Movement Flagship Store in downtown Long Beach, CA. The event is simply designed for creatives to come together, network and have a groovy time.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Your contribution.</h3>
<p>Whether you think so or not, anything you decide to do will make a great impact.  If you're unable to make any monetary contributions, you can help spread the word by simply sharing this with your friends and family.  A quick Facebook post, Twitter tweet or Instagram snapshot will go a long way.  I sincerely appreciate you stopping by. </p>

<h3>The Idea</h3>
<ul>
<li>After a few years out of college and some initial struggles, I am able to focus on what I love and cannot live without - my art!</li>
<li>This campaign is to help raise funds for the canvas, paint, supplies, travel, and lodging for the week-long trip. The funds will strictly be used for the art supplies to complete the life-sized project as well as the trip itself.</li>
<li>Your help will allow me to fund this painting that could lead to valuable connections and opportunities in the art world.</li>
</ul>
<p>I can't even express my thanks to all of you for even considering helping.</p>

<h3>The Supplies</h3>
<p>The piece will require:</p>
<ul>
<li>Large canvases for the painting itself</li>
<li>Gesso to prime the large-scale canvas</li>
<li>Acrylic paints and painting supplies (I will be using what I have to supplement this piece, but I definitely do not have enough paint to make it the whole way through!)</li>
<li>Painter's Tape (lots of it!)</li>
<li>Some grocery funds to help out those who open their homes to me!</li>
<li>Subway funds, food, and the train ticket to get to NYC!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why am I doing this residency?</h3>
<p>This venture is a way to get my name out there while building an incredible gallery show with my fellow artists. The opportunity to show in New York with an established group is an experience that doesn't come along every day. Though I do not expect to gain anything financially from this venture, the connections and experiences are invaluable. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

Subway funds, food, and the train ticket to get to NYC!


Why am I doing this residency?
This venture is a way to get my name out there while building an incredible gallery show with my fellow artists. The opportunity to show in New York with an established group is an experience that doesn't come along every day. Though I do not expect to gain anything financially from this venture, the connections and experiences are invaluable. 

Other Ways You Can Help

Share my campaign if you feel comfortable helping out - this means the world to me.
If you live in New York City or nearby, I hope to see you at the show September 2nd & 3rd!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Short(ish) Summary
 My name is Mickey Alice Kwapis. I am a taxidermist, craftsperson, and jewelry designer living in Chicago, Illinois with a dog, three cats, two rats, and an adult human. My work focuses on the relationship between humans and the natural world and my taxidermy work aims to educate people as to why preservation of species is important for the future. I do not kill animals and you can read all about that here. Please do not leave angry comments out of a lack of understanding.

This campaign was started as a means to raise money for new jewelry equipment so I can expand upon the themes already present in my work, but with more tools and resources at my disposal. Now that the second stretch goal of $1,500 has been met, I have added a new stretch goal of $2,000 to continue raising money for raw materials as well as donations for the following cause:

Because of the themes already present in my current work (pieces of which comprise the reward tiers for this campaign), and in order to give back to the dying populations from which I draw my inspiration, fifteen percent (15%) of proceeds from this campaign are being donated to honeybee colony collapse research. The rest will go towards purchasing materials and tools for jewelry fabrication, soldering, plating, and more. If the new stretch goal is met, $300 automatically gets donated to bee research - details below.
  What I Need & What You Get With this campaign, I am hoping to raise $2,000 for new jewelry equipment and materials. This includes a setup for cutting and hammering ring bands, annealing and pickling jewelry elements, soldering, polishing, and all of the materials for projects including raw metals, solder, saw blades, flux, and more. While there are cheaper things I could purchase at a hardware store to do a few of these tasks, I am aware of how quickly I will outgrow (and dispose of) them and I believe that purchasing a full, professional set-up will be much less wasteful in the long run. In addition to these funds covering costs of tools and equipment, I will use anything beyond that to purchase raw materials and a shelving unit to house all of it in my tiny studio.
No matter how much money I raise here, 8% of the total automatically goes towards payment processing. Since my rewards draw inspiration from (and in some cases, include victims of) colony collapse disorder in bee hives, I am also donating 15% of all proceeds to honeybee colony collapse disorder research at the National Resources Defense Council.

So what are the perks for you?





Contribute $55 or more and receive one of my signature honeybee necklaces. This necklace retails for $70 and is comprised of a glass vial with a real honeybee in it. Each honeybee was found deceased in my yard after our hive succumbed to colony collapse disorder. I suspend the preserved honeybee in a mix of my favorite taxidermy solutions along with some gold leaf flakes, triple-seal the whole thing, and cap it with a spent bullet casing gifted to me by my grandfather. If only ten more people bought this reward tier, the new stretch goal would be met! Also includes a hand-written thank-you note.






Contribute $15 or more and receive a pair of raw gemstone earrings, made with either chalcopyrite, pyrite, or quartz. I'm fairly sure you can include a note to me with your donation, but if not, please send an email to hello@mickeyalicekwapis.com with your preference on gemstone. These retail for $15-20 per pair and your order will also include a hand-written thank-you note.

Please make sure to include a valid shipping address with any reward tier. More details on estimated ship dates are below. If you do not choose a reward when making your donation, you will not receive one.

If I reach more than $2,000 I will still continue to donate 15% of all proceeds to honeybee research.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a video and music producer, writer, engineer, and performer. Throughout the years I have had my fair share of everything music related. I've played in bands, ran my own sound equipment for shows, ran my own recording studio, opened my own all ages venue, helped manage a huge team to put on a 2 day music festival, and the list goes on. If you name a job, I've probably done it.<br/><br/>Now is the time for me to take my sharpened talents, expand upon them, and put them to use on bigger projects. I want to go to LA because that is where my industry is. I've been attempting to take this trip for years, but I keep folding under circumstances that are out of my control. I currently have enough assets to sell off, that will fund my trip, for about 1 week, and then I will be out of money.<br/><br/>Your contribution will help me get stable in a place that is very expensive to live. When I first arrive in LA, I will be staying in Air BnB's, which is basically renting someones couch night by night. This can run anywhere from 20 a day up to 100 a day. Contributions will help me stay sharp, so I can find the network connections that I am searching for. I don't want to be stranded, worrying about how I will scrounge up enough to get my next meal. This is not the mindset that will push me forward, it will make me eager to jump into a situation that may not be the best fit. I want to be wise with my choices and follow my heart.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need enough money to get me through at least one month in LA. This money will be spent on travel, room, and board.<br/><br/>The perks to contributors are as unique as my skills. You can select from anything like, photography, video, music production, and audio engineering.</p>Even if the goal isn't met, I will still be taking this trip.</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I've heard it before, people who chase these dreams are facing 1 in a million odds that they will be discovered. I completely understand that my chances of being ""found"" are slim to none.<br/><br/>I don't plan to be found, I plan to lead people to me. I am excellent with communication, and ultimately, I just need to put myself into a position where I am able to show people how I use my talents. Once that moment arrives, everything will be on track.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>It's as simple as just sharing this campaign. Even if you can't afford any money right now, a simple share may open a door for me. That's why Indiegogo made it so simple to share.</p>

<p>Today my graffiti is defacing social inequality.

<p>The hope is not that we will create a influx of new potters but that folks can see the addagge ""you can be anything you want"" is true. Pottery is not just for a singular race or culture. It is representative of the human story and the contemporary urban experience needs its own voice. </p>

<h3>Garden of Eden in a time of collapse and renewal</h3>
<p>Support our build of an immersive garden of Tarot symbolism and artistic guided meditation.</p>
<p>We have been plotting this project for a full year and have been given the opportunity to build it. In this time of self-reflection and action, we feel grateful to build a project intent on internal guidance, sensation, and visual pleasure. We need some financial help to get there, but we hope you will join us in Garden of Eden at the cell theatre, opening in August and running through October (at least). Safety and connecting with immersive art in person in this new age of risk-assessment is our primary goal.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Ereka Imani Duncan and Jaclyn Atkinson have been creating installations as <a href=""https://darkmatterimmersive.com/home.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dark Matter</a> for 5 years and have been planning this Garden of Eden experience for over a year: a meditational journey through the Tarot via immersive installation. We have many of our basic tools and items covered (and glean much from the trash!) but all art projects come with hard costs. Let us break it down:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>What we need: </strong>Cleaning supplies (for between each visit), Uhaul rental for material transport (like pallets, large paper-mâché, fake grass, and other raw materials), sensory intoxicating plant life (eucalyptus, live moss and plants), raw materials (wood, paint, el-wire and lighting). If we go beyond our goal we would also like to pay a digital artist to help us build a Zoom room tarot reader booth. We would also like to present our distant tarot readers with a financial guarantee for their time.</li>
<li>
<strong>Perks you get: </strong>Book your tickets early through donation presale! Stickers! Handmade masks! Handmade moss crystal earrings and necklaces! Woodblock prints by Jaclyn Atkinson! Bribery Picnic Pie!</li>
<li>The cell theatre has blessed us with a beautiful space, administrative support, and staff, but we need money to make it run beautifully. All events and entry to the Garden will be split with the cell theatre. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Support the arts / Shadow work</h3>
<p>In a New York that is boxed up, with Broadway lights off, Cirque at bankruptcy, gatherings limited, and galleries scrambling, we are facing a city full of possibilities for new creativity, but still caged in impossible structures of wealth and real-estate. Aside from health risks and financial instability, we stand at a revolutionary tide, Black Lives Matter and we have been building this project fueled by the desire for change and renewed urgency rooted in the belief that we must all go through shadow work, individually and as a country, to build a better future.<br/>Shadow work is sifting through the unconscious, the unknown within, to tend your own garden and glean a deeper understanding of self and path. We find the Tarot an important tool for this process. We have focused our energies on making this installation a form of meditation and reflection, believing that the Tarot can be used as a tool for processing and to shift understanding. </p>
<ul>
<li>Come with an understanding of the Tarot or with nothing in mind but openness, either experience will be valid,</li>
<li>We believe that internal progress can be spawned by self-questioning and think of Tarot as a tool to explore that. We all have work to do.</li>
<li>Support if you can, we need help to make this space blossom. We know that there are many important causes to support right now, and we hope that you can and will still do so. No one will be turned away for lack of funds to this experience—we are planning with accessibility in mind.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges in a Time of Covid and Art Crisis</h3>
<p>Do you miss seeing art experiences in person as much as we do? Worried about returning to an immersive environment while still cautiously accessing your risk? We have spent time thinking about how to move forward. We got you, here's our plan for now:</p>
<ul>
<li>You book a time to visit, ensuring that you are the ONLY person (or quara-couple) in the experience at a time. Our space guardian greets you masked and remains at a safe 6 ft distance. All other interactions happen through sensory and digital—It's just you and the space.</li>
<li>We have limited the items you touch and wipe off each of these items between visits. We request all guests keep their masks on.</li>
<li>Please come with a mask and be dedicated to social distancing practices.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help Our Project</h3>
<p>If you can't financially contribute, but still want to help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell your friends: Help us get the word out to get us funded (you can use the Indiegogo share tools)! </li>
<li>Message us for a discounted ticket to the event. We do not wish to turn away anyone for financial troubles and believe that this artful meditation should be available for all who desire it—accessibility is key—especially in these times. </li>
</ul>

Ereka Imani Duncan and Jaclyn Atkinson have been creating installations as Dark Matter for 5 years and have been planning this Garden of Eden experience for over a year: a meditational journey through the Tarot via immersive installation. We have many of our basic tools and items covered (and glean much from the trash!) but all art projects come with hard costs. Let us break it down:


What we need: Cleaning supplies (for between each visit), Uhaul rental for material transport (like pallets, large paper-mâché, fake grass, and other raw materials), sensory intoxicating plant life (eucalyptus, live moss and plants), raw materials (wood, paint, el-wire and lighting). If we go beyond our goal we would also like to pay a digital artist to help us build a Zoom room tarot reader booth. We would also like to present our distant tarot readers with a financial guarantee for their time.

Perks you get: Book your tickets early through donation presale! Stickers! Handmade masks! Handmade moss crystal earrings and necklaces! Woodblock prints by Jaclyn Atkinson! Bribery Picnic Pie!
The cell theatre has blessed us with a beautiful space, administrative support, and staff, but we need money to make it run beautifully. All events and entry to the Garden will be split with the cell theatre. 


Support the arts / Shadow work
In a New York that is boxed up, with Broadway lights off, Cirque at bankruptcy, gatherings limited, and galleries scrambling, we are facing a city full of possibilities for new creativity, but still caged in impossible structures of wealth and real-estate. Aside from health risks and financial instability, we stand at a revolutionary tide, Black Lives Matter and we have been building this project fueled by the desire for change and renewed urgency rooted in the belief that we must all go through shadow work, individually and as a country, to build a better future.Shadow work is sifting through the unconscious, the unknown within, to tend your own garden and glean a deeper understanding of self and path. We find the Tarot an important tool for this process. We have focused our energies on making this installation a form of meditation and reflection, believing that the Tarot can be used as a tool for processing and to shift understanding. 

Come with an understanding of the Tarot or with nothing in mind but openness, either experience will be valid,
We believe that internal progress can be spawned by self-questioning and think of Tarot as a tool to explore that. We all have work to do.
Support if you can, we need help to make this space blossom. We know that there are many important causes to support right now, and we hope that you can and will still do so. No one will be turned away for lack of funds to this experience—we are planning with accessibility in mind.


Risks & Challenges in a Time of Covid and Art Crisis
Do you miss seeing art experiences in person as much as we do? Worried about returning to an immersive environment while still cautiously accessing your risk? We have spent time thinking about how to move forward. We got you, here's our plan for now:

You book a time to visit, ensuring that you are the ONLY person (or quara-couple) in the experience at a time. Our space guardian greets you masked and remains at a safe 6 ft distance. All other interactions happen through sensory and digital—It's just you and the space.
We have limited the items you touch and wipe off each of these items between visits. We request all guests keep their masks on.
Please come with a mask and be dedicated to social distancing practices.


Other Ways You Can Help Our Project
If you can't financially contribute, but still want to help:

Tell your friends: Help us get the word out to get us funded (you can use the Indiegogo share tools)! 
Message us for a discounted ticket to the event. We do not wish to turn away anyone for financial troubles and believe that this artful meditation should be available for all who desire it—accessibility is key—especially in these times.

More than half of the population lives in poverty and per capita income is one of the lowest in the region. The increased productivity needed to break Honduras' persistent high poverty rate depends, in part, on further improvements in educational attainment. Although primary-school enrollment is near 100%, educational quality is poor, the drop-out rate and grade repetition remain high, and teacher and school accountability is low. </p><p><b>Honduras is the Murder Capital of the World</b></p><p>Guns are responsible for over 80 percent of homicides in Honduras, one of the highest rates of gun homicide in Latin America. Every day 20 people are murdered and only 2% of criminal cases end in conviction. Honduras places third for the largest quantity of violent deaths among adolescents, due to the fact that a large quantity of its young people are involved in criminal activity and the drug trade. The reason so many youth are involved in criminal activity is because only 30% of Honduran youth go to high school and therefore the informal sector is the fastest way to make money.</p><p><b>Culture of Apathy</b></p><p>Honduran society has become incredibly indifferent to the corruption and overload of violence, that no one feels like their voices matter anymore. This culture of apathy combined with very little opportunities for youth, has also fueled criminal activity. <br/></p><p></p><h3></h3><h3>

<p>
</p>
<h4>My Ongoing Work.</h4>
<p>
</p>
<p>An update on what
I've been making happen since I started this campaign. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Over the last six weeks
I have been to 13 political meetings</b> including Full Council, Cabinet,
individual meetings with cabinet councillors, Hustings for the PCC
election, and attended Public meetings on Planning and the City's
Budget.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p> So far I've published
19 articles to my <a href=""http://thepublicinterestsheffield.blogspot.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Blog site</a>, had an article published in<a href=""http://nowthenmagazine.com/sheffield/issue-80/devolution/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Now Then Magazine</a>, an interview with them is published on December 3<sup>rd</sup>,
an interview with Ellen Beardmore published in <a href=""http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/drive-to-explore-council-1-6930911"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">'The Sheffield Star'</a>
newspaper and talked on <b>BBC Radio Sheffield</b> about the post of the PCC
and the by-election.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I was also interviewed
by <b>Max Munday</b> alongside Scott Lavery of the University of Sheffield,
on <b>Sheffield Live TV</b>, talking about the current so called
'devolution' on offer to the city regions.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>During that short six
weeks my main achievement has been to <b>drag the 'Devolution' issue
into the light</b> of public scrutiny. Secrecy over discussions between
councils and the government on what is being termed devolution has
been brought out and the fact that both <b>government and councils are
denying the public any knowledge or say in the process</b> has now been
publicised.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In addition I've
managed to get a cabinet councillor to confirm that transparency and
openness are the most important things in the planning process and
the commitment of another cabinet councillor to regreening Meadowhead
roundabout desecrated by Highway Department 'improvements'. Finally I
was able to act as a catalyst for the <b>objections to the proposed
demolition plans for the Devonshire Street shops</b> that include 'Rare
and Racy', a legendary record &amp; book store, and other independent
traders.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>I think that's a good
record for six weeks work. The trouble is, unless this campaign
generates significantly more money than to date, this level of work
is unsustainable.</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The actions and
decisions of City Council and regional decision makers like the
Sheffield City Region Combined Authority, The Sheffield Executive
Board and the Police and Crime Panel will be largely under the radar.
This will be bad for the public and bad for the city.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>I therefore appeal</b> to
each and every person who reads this to contribute to my campaign.
Without support I cannot continue at this level, if at all. A small
donation from many people will enable me to continue and to keep our
community leaders as honest as possible and their decision making as
transparent as possible. <b>If you don't contribute who will?</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<br/><h3>Background<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p><b>The public should know
all we can about the business of the decision makers that affect our
lives, our wallets and our democracy.</b> I want to be able to put full
time effort into trying to improve the levels of transparency and
accountability within Sheffield City Council and the other
organisations that influence the way our City is run. <b>To shine a
light on how decisions are made and where the money goes.</b> If I can
also help others to find their own voice and influence along the way,
then that is a bonus. </p>

<b>Nigel Slack.</b> I'm a 53
year old citizen of Sheffield. I use the term<b> 'active citizen'</b> to
describe myself as someone who is busy in the city's civic society. I
try, where I can, to make a difference, to provide a public point of
view on the way decisions are made and influenced.
<p>
</p>
<p>I was switched back on
to politics following the emergence of the 'Occupy' movement
worldwide and particularly in Sheffield. I began to realise that we
have lots of information in this world but often have too little knowledge to
make sense of the 'system'. <b>One news story about the City Council
congratulating a profit making major bus company on securing public
funds to invest in new buses, from which it would make yet more
profit made me wonder 'why?'</b>. I took my first step on this road to a
better understanding of local politics, decision making and
influence.<b> Now I'm excited to try and take this to a new level.</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>My background experience has been invaluable in helping me navigate this tangled web, from
my education, post graduate level in management studies through many years in sales to working in business strategy and restructuring.
Throughout I've had a thread of charity volunteering, working with
Sheffield AIDSline in the early days of the HIV crisis and for some
ten years, as an elected officer, part of the charity's team, guiding
it in addressing local and regional strategic approaches
to sexual health.</p>

<h3><b>About what I do</b></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/927665/files/20141013141001-SCC_Cabinet_meeting_copy.jpg?1413234601"" src="""" style=""width: 269.112px; height: 164px;""/></p>
<p><b>The
biggest part of what I do is ask questions.</b> A simple idea but,
getting sensible and informative answers means devising questions
that cannot easily be ignored and are not just about criticising
what's happening but looking for <b>a way to improve what is happening</b>.
It's about knowing how to research the information needed to
write a good question, who is the best person to ask, and how to spot
when questions are responded to but not answered. <b>It's also about
persistence.</b> If you don't get the information you need first time,
ask a different question, ask a different person or break it down
into bite size questions that come together as the answer to the big
question.</p>
<p><b>Most people don't have the time</b> to get involved in Council Meetings, asking questions, doing research, chasing for answers. Many would find it dull or worry that they don't have the skills. I find it exciting. It's a<b> 'thrill of the hunt'</b> thing or like <b>solving the mystery</b> before the author gives it away. The chance to devote myself to it full time? <b>Incredibly exciting</b>.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Asking
questions opens doors, persistence pushes doors wide and good
research lets you understand what's behind the door.</b> This combined
approach has enabled me to effect change. Changing the way my
questions and suggestions are seen within the establishment, changing
the way information is available to the public and changing the
perception of what one person can achieve.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>The
other thing I do is to offer a different perspective.</b> I am
apolitical, I have no affiliation to any political party, large or
small. I will talk with any of them and I will debate with any of
them. I have the ability to 'think outside the box' as they say and
there is no 'party discipline' preventing me from asking what I want
and debating what I want. Some of the local parties and their
extended networks seem to appreciate this fresh  point of view,
others are more wary and prefer an arms length approach, but I think
they are all now aware that my intentions are to help improve my City
and the way it is run. <br/></p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/927674/files/20141013141516-S4D_Feedback_Meeting_2_a.jpg?1413234916"" src="""" style=""width: 256.419px; height: 138px;""/>    <a href=""http://reformgroups.net/sheffield/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sheffield for Democracy website</a><br/></p>
<b>
</b><p>Having talked about
what one person can achieve, there is also a place for teamwork.
Recently I have begun working with a local community group called
<b>Sheffield for Democracy</b>, alongside my own<b> public interest</b>. Many of
our issues are complementary and, like me, they take an apolitical
approach to their campaigning. As the group we address local issues
like the way Sheffield City Council address community engagement and
the way the scrutiny system works. We have also submitted evidence to
the council about the current electoral boundary review. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Regionally we are
continuing efforts to make oversight of cross border bodies like
Sheffield City Region Combined Authority and the Police &amp; Crime
Commissioner more transparent and accessible to the public, whilst
nationally we have submitted evidence to two inquiries by the
Political &amp; Constitutional Reform Select Committee and appeared
before them to give evidence on 'Voter Engagement'. We actively
engage with local MPs and recently had a meeting with the Deputy
Prime Minister, Nick Clegg about local devolution and the 'MPs Recall
Bill'.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Sheffield for Democracy</b>
has a hard working core of dedicated volunteers but no money and a
big job to do in protecting and promoting democracy in the city and
region. This project will help me and them to continue working
together long term and continue <b>engaging the public of Sheffield in
democratic issues</b>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3><b>The Money</b></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/929164/files/20141014033225-Ten_Shillig_note.jpg?1413282745"" src="""" style=""width: 202.574px; height: 95px;""/></p>
<b>What will the money do?</b>
In the simplest terms it will provide a basic wage to enable me to
commit to this work full time. With the money being raised by public
subscription it will mean I am operating entirely independently.<b>
Independent of party politics, independent of patronage, and
independent of influence from other organisations</b>. I will be able to
continue to ask the questions that need asking, push for positive
change in the city and to work with others of a similar mind without
restrictions imposed from any 'other'. I will have the <b>opportunity to share all I do with the public</b>, through social media, blogging and regular reporting to other media outlets.<br/><p>
</p>
<p><b>Basic wage</b> + stationery
+ travel = <b>£18,000</b> + Middle man costs (Indiegogo) + donation rewards =
<b>£20,000</b></p>
<p><b>If
I don't raise this amount</b>, I will use whatever I do raise to work on
the project for as long as possible. If I raise more, which would be incredible, it will simply extend the length of time available to
work for the public good before I have to do more fundraising.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3><b>Future Plans</b></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/929182/files/20141014035037-robots-antique.jpg?1413283837"" src="""" style=""width: 205.2px; height: 138px;""/></p>
<p>I'm currently working
towards getting the City Council's public meetings broadcast on the
internet (<b>Webcasting</b>) to improve transparency and in trying to get
the council to find ways to<b> increase income to the city to mitigate
by millions of pounds the effect of austerity funding cuts</b> handed
down from Government.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I am also continuing to<b>
push for ever greater information</b> to be made available about the
private companies that deliver public services, including profits and
their inclusion under 'Freedom of Information' regulations.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>In the immediate future</b>
the launch of this project will also see the public launch of what
has been a relatively private blog site of mine called '<b>Public
Interest</b>' recording my work, as well as a new Facebook page for
discussions and my newly acquired Twitter presence for news updates
and interesting tit bits.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Further down the line</b> I
want to start looking at the 'planning' process within the city as
there seem to be some problems around transparency and the public's
basic understanding of how the procedure works. In addition there
seems to be ongoing concerns with the protection of the city's
heritage. I also want to explore the public appetite for and the
opportunity for<b> holding Councillors to account for their voting</b> and
attendance record at various council meetings.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The <b>potential of the
city's new TV service</b> is on my horizon where I hope to pitch, in the
very near future, an idea for a politics debate show of some form</p>

<p><b>I hate blowing my own
trumpet</b>, it's not really my style. I tend to get on with what I'm
doing and <b>making positive change happen</b> is what matters to me. I also
know that<b> what I do has an effect</b>, sometimes small but sometimes not
so small. For this project however I guess I need to give some
outline of what I've been able to achieve over the last couple of
years <b>as a very part-time 'Active Citizen'</b>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The first thing I
managed to do was to place in the public realm information about <b>the
amount of profits private contractors were making out of the public
purse</b>. It actually took a few months but it rated a <a href=""http://www.thestar.co.uk/news/business/sheffield-council-s-9-million-contractors-gravy-train-1-4995622"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">front page splash</a>
in the Sheffield Star newspaper. Following on shortly afterwards I
was<b> interviewed by <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/laurence-peacock/nigel-slack-discusses-council"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sheffield Live</a> Community Radio</b> about my efforts
and that meant the Council Cabinet member for finance felt he
had to respond with a similar interview to defend the council's
position. I've also contributed <b>BBC Radio interviews and 'Now Then'
magazine <a href=""http://nowthenmagazine.com/sheffield/issue-56/outsourcing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">article</a></b> on this subject.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I have continued
working on the<b> transparency of council 'Outsourcing' </b>arrangements
and, working with officers as well as cabinet members, the council
website now carries <b>detailed information on the <a href=""https://www.sheffield.gov.uk/business-economy/contracts/scc/major-contracts.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">major city contracts</a></b>.
They detail the services that the contractors are supposed to deliver
(for the first time) and information about their<b> performance and the
contract management</b> arrangements. We now know names and contact
information for the service managers and the council officers that
oversee their operations. The 'Streets Ahead' contract with Amey is
available on the website, after many attempts by the then cabinet
member for finance to forget that he'd agreed to do this. More
importantly the way future contracts will be negotiated now commits
the council to what's known as <b>'presumed disclosure'</b>. In other words,
unless the contractor can prove strong 'confidentiality' reasons not
to, the process and the contract itself will be in the public domain.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>My concerns, first
raised in October 2012 about the<b> tax affairs</b> of some outsourcing
contractors and the<b> poor human rights records</b> of others, has
continued to gain momentum and the council recently confirmed they
will be reviewing the contracting regulations in the city to reflect
public concern over these issues.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In July 2013 I was the
first to raise concerns with the council about the increasing use of<b>
zero hour contracts</b>, particularly in the care sector and questioned
their use by the council. <b>This led to a review by the council of its
use of zero hour contracts</b>. A little later in the year I undertook some
research for the Green Party into what is termed the '<b>Supermarket
Levy</b>' which led to a motion being placed before the council to ask
central government to use the Sustainable Communities Act to enable
local authorities to implement the scheme. This was inevitably
defeated by the council's majority party.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Over and above these
specific achievements I now represent either myself or Sheffield for
Democracy at events and meetings throughout the city and region.</b> I
connect with and try to influence organisations such as the Sheffield
Executive Board, the Police &amp; Crime Panel, and various one off
events such as the Sheffield City Summit.</p>

My Ongoing Work.


An update on what
I've been making happen since I started this campaign. 



Over the last six weeks
I have been to 13 political meetings including Full Council, Cabinet,
individual meetings with cabinet councillors, Hustings for the PCC
election, and attended Public meetings on Planning and the City's
Budget.


 So far I've published
19 articles to my Blog site, had an article published in Now Then Magazine, an interview with them is published on December 3rd,
an interview with Ellen Beardmore published in 'The Sheffield Star'
newspaper and talked on BBC Radio Sheffield about the post of the PCC
and the by-election.


I was also interviewed
by Max Munday alongside Scott Lavery of the University of Sheffield,
on Sheffield Live TV, talking about the current so called
'devolution' on offer to the city regions.


During that short six
weeks my main achievement has been to drag the 'Devolution' issue
into the light of public scrutiny. Secrecy over discussions between
councils and the government on what is being termed devolution has
been brought out and the fact that both government and councils are
denying the public any knowledge or say in the process has now been
publicised.


In addition I've
managed to get a cabinet councillor to confirm that transparency and
openness are the most important things in the planning process and
the commitment of another cabinet councillor to regreening Meadowhead
roundabout desecrated by Highway Department 'improvements'. Finally I
was able to act as a catalyst for the objections to the proposed
demolition plans for the Devonshire Street shops that include 'Rare
and Racy', a legendary record & book store, and other independent
traders.


I think that's a good
record for six weeks work. The trouble is, unless this campaign
generates significantly more money than to date, this level of work
is unsustainable.


The actions and
decisions of City Council and regional decision makers like the
Sheffield City Region Combined Authority, The Sheffield Executive
Board and the Police and Crime Panel will be largely under the radar.
This will be bad for the public and bad for the city.


I therefore appeal to
each and every person who reads this to contribute to my campaign.
Without support I cannot continue at this level, if at all. A small
donation from many people will enable me to continue and to keep our
community leaders as honest as possible and their decision making as
transparent as possible. If you don't contribute who will?


Background
 
The public should know
all we can about the business of the decision makers that affect our
lives, our wallets and our democracy. I want to be able to put full
time effort into trying to improve the levels of transparency and
accountability within Sheffield City Council and the other
organisations that influence the way our City is run. To shine a
light on how decisions are made and where the money goes. If I can
also help others to find their own voice and influence along the way,
then that is a bonus. 

Listen to Nigel describing his 'Public Interest' funding campaign


  


About Me

    The Public Interest Blog - Facebook Page - My Twitter
Nigel Slack. I'm a 53
year old citizen of Sheffield. I use the term 'active citizen' to
describe myself as someone who is busy in the city's civic society. I
try, where I can, to make a difference, to provide a public point of
view on the way decisions are made and influenced.


I was switched back on
to politics following the emergence of the 'Occupy' movement
worldwide and particularly in Sheffield. I began to realise that we
have lots of information in this world but often have too little knowledge to
make sense of the 'system'. One news story about the City Council
congratulating a profit making major bus company on securing public
funds to invest in new buses, from which it would make yet more
profit made me wonder 'why?'. I took my first step on this road to a
better understanding of local politics, decision making and
influence. Now I'm excited to try and take this to a new level.


My background experience has been invaluable in helping me navigate this tangled web, from
my education, post graduate level in management studies through many years in sales to working in business strategy and restructuring.
Throughout I've had a thread of charity volunteering, working with
Sheffield AIDSline in the early days of the HIV crisis and for some
ten years, as an elected officer, part of the charity's team, guiding
it in addressing local and regional strategic approaches
to sexual health.



About what I do

The
biggest part of what I do is ask questions. A simple idea but,
getting sensible and informative answers means devising questions
that cannot easily be ignored and are not just about criticising
what's happening but looking for a way to improve what is happening.
It's about knowing how to research the information needed to
write a good question, who is the best person to ask, and how to spot
when questions are responded to but not answered. It's also about
persistence. If you don't get the information you need first time,
ask a different question, ask a different person or break it down
into bite size questions that come together as the answer to the big
question.
Most people don't have the time to get involved in Council Meetings, asking questions, doing research, chasing for answers. Many would find it dull or worry that they don't have the skills. I find it exciting. It's a 'thrill of the hunt' thing or like solving the mystery before the author gives it away. The chance to devote myself to it full time? Incredibly exciting.


Asking
questions opens doors, persistence pushes doors wide and good
research lets you understand what's behind the door. This combined
approach has enabled me to effect change. Changing the way my
questions and suggestions are seen within the establishment, changing
the way information is available to the public and changing the
perception of what one person can achieve.


The
other thing I do is to offer a different perspective. I am
apolitical, I have no affiliation to any political party, large or
small. I will talk with any of them and I will debate with any of
them. I have the ability to 'think outside the box' as they say and
there is no 'party discipline' preventing me from asking what I want
and debating what I want. Some of the local parties and their
extended networks seem to appreciate this fresh  point of view,
others are more wary and prefer an arms length approach, but I think
they are all now aware that my intentions are to help improve my City
and the way it is run.

The Money

What will the money do?

Independent of party politics, independent of patronage, and

Basic wage + stationery

£20,000
If
I don't raise this amount, I will use whatever I do raise to work on
the project for as long as possible. If I raise more, which would be incredible, it will simply extend the length of time available to

Deanne Rowe and Glenna West we write ""The Stiletto"" books.  The books are doing great, thanks to all our fans.  They're quick, fun reads with three separate stories in one book and they each involve ""stilettos"" in some way.  At our book signings, we give away ""stiletto"" keychains as a token of our appreciation to those who buy our books. </p>
<p>Well, one day, a friend sent me the picture of what I call ""The Stilettomobile"".  That was it. I just had to have it to take to our book signings.  Can you imagine the excitement that would cause!  It'll bring people out to our signings and in today's book world, you need something to draw attention to your books; something to make you stand out from the crowd.  We're no Stephen King or Janet Evanovich although we're trying.  So the something for us is ""The Stilettomobile"". </p>
<p>Once I saw the photo, I asked on Facebook, who could build it for me and low and behold a lady I grew up with, Brenda, told me her son, Chad, could build it.  Chad builds custom trucks and for him building ""The Stilettomobile"" would be a piece of cake.  Thus, my fund for the ""Help an Old Lady Buy a Shoe"" campaign started.  I made a sign to take to our book signings, put a picture of ""The Stilettomobile"" on it and started talking it up.  People love it and have been donating a few dollars as they could.  So far I've raised over $2,000.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We 're going to build the Stilettomobile in steps.  The first thing is we need the motorbike base and for that we're trying to raise $10,000 to go with the $2,000 I already have. </p>
<p>All the money we collect goes to Chad in Northport, Alabama.  He'll use all the money we send him to buy the bike that'll go underneath the shoe and also have the shoe itself cast from fiberglass.  It'll be expensive!  But I know with your help we can do this!</p>
<p>Once it's done, ""The Stiletto Girls"" as we've become known, will take it on the road.  Yep, we plan to take it to all our book signings, and drive it in parades and other events.  We'll bring it to a town near you and you can have your picture made with it.  It'll be totally awesome!</p>
<p>We're planning a contest for those who donate.  For a certain number of lucky winners, we'll bring ""The Stilettomobile"" directly to your town, right to your front door and we'll take you for a spin in ""The Stilettomobile.""  We haven't figured out just how many trips we can do in a year.  We both have to make a living so we work full-time jobs in addition to our writing.</p>
<p>If we don't make our entire goal, the money still goes to Chad and he'll work on ""The Stilettomobile"" as he can and as we continue to raise funds and send it to him. If we make more than our goal, we'll use the rest for the upkeep of ""The Stilettomobile"" like gasoline, oil, etc.</p>
<p>After we get the bike, then we'll start working on raising the funds for the fiberglass shoe itself (unless of course we can get this campaign to go viral and we get enough donations here to take care of the entire thing!). </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Now ""The Stilettomobile"" may not be the top campaign in the world right now but at least it'll bring a smile to a lot of faces when it shows up at your front door.  You know you want a chance to ride in it and wave at all your friends as you pass by.  What a hoot! </p>
<p>For the Stiletto Girls, it will get us one step closer to the New York Times Bestseller List.  All three of us, myself, Deanne and Glenna would love being full-time writers.  We love getting out there and meeting all of you, our fans!  That's what makes writing so much fun for us.  It's meeting the fans and hearing your stories of what our stories mean to you!</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>While most of you will be able to donate something to help us out, some of you may not.  But, you can still help.  You can spread the word about ""The Stilettomobile"" and help us get those donations rolling in.</p>
<p>The more noise we can create about our campaign the better our chances are.  So have fun with it, talk it up, tell your neighbors they're never going to believe what you saw!  Let them know they can help bring the Stilettomobile to your town!  Spread the word!</p>

<h3>Meld - A Sourcing Project...</h3> <p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Meld is a traveling exhibitions and
event management team.  We are a collection of artists, designers, builders, farmers and big-time thinkers all based in Boston Massachusetts! The team
temporarily turns established spaces into places for both food and art in the
form of a pop-up gallery. We curate and install exhibitions in food resources
such as breweries, restaurants and markets. Finally to bring the public
together the team crafts an event infused with local food and the exhibited
art. Meld is an effort to provide a space where the middleman for the local food and art industry become one. </span><br/></p>
<p>

This campaign is important to us because we believe that art, food and conversation are inextricably connected. Farmers and artists are not too different from each other, they both need the support of a community and the exposure. Meld feels strongly that we can provide that support through our events.</p>
<p>By investing in Meld's campaign you are investing in promoting a local community. All funds will go towards starting the foundation of this program. We need the funds to build the walls, the pedestals, purchase lights, promotional materials and local food from our farmers.</p>
<p>With this kind of foundation we can provide a pop-up gallery in a local venue. For every venue we will change the gallery layout, the exhibited show, and the seasonal food provided at the opening event.</p>
<p>Meld gives spaces a chance to be pop-up places. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
</div><h3>What does this thing look like?</h3><div>Different Meld team members have developed the skills to put on an event like this through producing gallery shows, openings, and various performative productions. Meld will bring the qualities that a gallery space has to offer with the comfort of a farm to table experience. Openings will be infused with locally sourced hors d'oeuvres and unique gallery spaces. A few examples of what we are <i>MELDing  </i>together are in the images below.</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1126283/files/20150101161458-IMG_6395.jpg?1420157698"" src="""" style=""""/></p>[above] A pop-up gallery show in the south end called <i>Regeneration. </i>One of Emelie Berghs[Garden Collective artist] collections is featured here.</span></div><div>

<p>In our high paced consumer
society we have grown distant from the origins of our resources. It seems to me
that we tend to gravitate towards food and art for socializing, it’s at the
heart of our culture. Going to a gallery, a cup of coffee with a friend,
watching a new film, or sitting down for a beer at the end of a long day, are
all examples of how we interact but they rarely overlap. What if there was a
space where you could enjoy cuisine made from local produce, grab a beer at the
brewery bar and browse some locally grown art with friends? Wouldn’t that be
something? </p>
<p>In Anna's (founder) time at MassArt she has established herself in the event production field. She has curated shows on and
off campus. Anna and the team have been involved in many productions in the city, together building a diverse range of skill sets. The most thrilling part of these production is designing experiences that activate a sense of comfort and trigger a spark of
change in a viewer. The Meld team wants to bring these pop-up gallery spaces out to the public to travel and share the experience of local potential.</p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Investing in our campaign is a great way to help and push this project forward. However we know that is not possible for many. Other great ways to support us is sharing our story.</p>
<p>Tell your local farmer, share our mission with your aunt's pottery class, tell your favorite brewery they could have a pop-up gallery and send them our way!</p>

</div></div>","Meld - A Sourcing Project... Meld is a traveling exhibitions and
event management team.  We are a collection of artists, designers, builders, farmers and big-time thinkers all based in Boston Massachusetts! The team
temporarily turns established spaces into places for both food and art in the
form of a pop-up gallery. We curate and install exhibitions in food resources
such as breweries, restaurants and markets. Finally to bring the public
together the team crafts an event infused with local food and the exhibited
art. Meld is an effort to provide a space where the middleman for the local food and art industry become one. 


This campaign is important to us because we believe that art, food and conversation are inextricably connected. Farmers and artists are not too different from each other, they both need the support of a community and the exposure. Meld feels strongly that we can provide that support through our events.
By investing in Meld's campaign you are investing in promoting a local community. All funds will go towards starting the foundation of this program. We need the funds to build the walls, the pedestals, purchase lights, promotional materials and local food from our farmers.
With this kind of foundation we can provide a pop-up gallery in a local venue. For every venue we will change the gallery layout, the exhibited show, and the seasonal food provided at the opening event.
Meld gives spaces a chance to be pop-up places. 


What does this thing look like?Different Meld team members have developed the skills to put on an event like this through producing gallery shows, openings, and various performative productions. Meld will bring the qualities that a gallery space has to offer with the comfort of a farm to table experience. Openings will be infused with locally sourced hors d'oeuvres and unique gallery spaces. A few examples of what we are MELDing  together are in the images below.[above] A pop-up gallery show in the south end called Regeneration. One of Emelie Berghs[Garden Collective artist] collections is featured here.
 
[above] The Garden Collective co-curated a show called Honey Bees & Garden Weeds in the Student Life Gallery at MassArt in the spring of 2014. This show included 25 artists in a variety of mediums. 


[above] Anna was the Production Assistant for the The Community Canteen - A pop-up dinner series in Somerville, MA at Something GUD.

What We Need & What You Get To launch Meld we need to raise $7,900. Ok, but for what?
-Fabricating portable gallery walls and pedestals
-Purchasing adequate lighting
-Ordering seasonal produce for the opening event

<h3>The artist:</h3>
<p> Hi, I am Blanca Caraballo, a visual artist born in Cuba in 1969. I studied visual arts in the Higher Institute of Education: Enrique Jose Varona in La Habana (mostly know as the Columbia) from 1987 to 1990. I immigrated to the United States in 1991, during  the “special period”. I continued my education in the arts in Miami, Florida graduating in 2002 from Florida International University. I  have participated in many exhibitions in USA, Mexico, Spain and Argentina. I  worked mainly in painting and drawing, but also has produced artist’s books, mail art, sculptures and objects. </p>
<p>On December 2011, I felt the need to communicate to a wider audience and to leave the traditional setting of a gallery space. I participated in the Miami based public arts project “Giants in the City“ with a 20' sculpture depicting a white queen chess piece called “God Save the Queen”. Using the game of chess as a symbol of life, I choose the only feminine piece in the board, the queen, and investigates our understanding of gender and power.  The project was exhibited in Bayfront Park, Miami during Art Basel week in 2011, and subsequently in Sleepless Night Festival and the Botanical Garden in Miami Beach and the opening of the Young Art Museum in Davie, Florida. </p>
<p><strong> </strong>Although the project has become a tradition in Miami since 2008 when it won the Knight Foundation award, and have considerable assistance from the local government, the artists have to come up with the funding for their individual projects. I self-produced the first piece “God Saved the Queen” in 2011, but I need funding to produce a second sculpture, the Star Finder Project. </p>
<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Description:</span></h3>
<p>The Star Finder Project involves the production of a giant 25’ x 15’ inflatable sculpture for the Miami based Public Art Project “Giants in the City” (<a href=""http://giantsinthecity.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://giantsinthecity.com/</a>) that was invited to participate in Essen, Germany for the prestigious International Art Fair - C.A.R (Contemporary Art Rhum) (<a href=""http://www.contemporaryartruhr.de/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.contemporaryartruhr.de</a>) that will take place from November 2nd to 4th, 2012. The piece should be made in black fabric to match the specific architecture and aesthetic concept of the fair, based on the New Puristic style of the architecture in Essen, an industrial city, known for its beautiful coal mines.</p>
<h3><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Star Finder<strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> Project Statement:</span></strong></span></strong></h3>
<p>I use art as a practice of self-inquiry. It becomes a decantation process of possible adjunct identities, which leads to the void.</p>
<p>In the Star Finder project, a fragment of the astrolabes, an old time and location measuring instrument, (The star pointing device) is interpreted increasing its size to a massive 25 feet inflatable sculpture. It points to the zenith, encircling stars suggesting our location in time and space as well as it relation to the cosmos.</p>
<p>The sculpture will be exhibited during C.A.R. and it will continue its travel as part of the nomadic public arts exhibition of massive sculptures Giants in the City.</p>
<h3>The Rewards:</h3>
<p>By contributing to this campaign you will have the reward of producing the sculpture and allowing its participation in one of the most prestigious young art fairs in Europe. Even though I have  participated in exhibitions oversea none have been as important as C.A.R. Participation in this project will catapult my career to a higher level. In the past, I have been unable to travel with my art due to lack of funds. This would be the first time that this public arts project and I as an artist cross the ocean to Europe and exhibit in one of the most prestigious fairs in Germany. </p>
<p>The participation of giants in the City in this great project is contested upon the participation of the individual artists. The participation of the Star Finder is dependent of your generous contribution to the elaboration of the piece. The cost of producing the piece is estimated $3000 which covers the fabric, manufacturing, shipping from the manufacturer in Mexico to Miami, blower that constantly supplies the air, painting intervention in the piece and sign with the names of the artist and project statement. The trip and stay in Essen by the artist is estimated $2000, according to the price of the air ticket, hotel and meals. The total cost of the project is $5000.00</p>
<p>Whatever amount is raised will be used toward the production of the piece. The cost of travel will be covered if more funds are raised to pay for it. All contributors will receive some kind of reward according to your contribution. Limited edition of t-shirts, silk screened prints and originals will be produced to reward the contributors. These rewards will be shipped in September 2012 once the campaign is completed.

<h3> How can you help?</h3>
<p>You can get the word out about this project. Use the Indigogo share tool , place a link in your facebook or any other social media and let others know that they can contribute to this campaign.

Nei giorni precedenti, allestiremo l'area usando materiali di recupero.Durante la settimana impareremo come produrre carta artigianalmente, ci occuperemo di sperimentazioni sugli impasti di cibo e sugli incarti, prenderemo parte ad una performance teatrale e progetteremo una scenografia per la stessa, riciclando carta, cartone e materiali di fortuna.I laboratori sono aperti a chiunque voglia parteciparvi e voglia trascorrere una settimana di campeggio nel Sud Italia, nell'agro di Minervino Murge (BT).Allestiremo l'area con l'aiuto di gente del posto e il materiale di recupero verrà impiegato nella costruzione di strutture temporanee e removibili.Aiutateci a fare in modo che questo accada nel modo migliore!Nel laboratorio su ""Scenografia e riciclo"" noi ospiteremo l'architetto Riccardo Dalisi. Abbiamo deciso di coinvolgerlo perché rappresenta per noi una guida ""morale"" nella progettazione sostenibile, grazie alla sua lunga esperienza di lavoro con i materiali poveri.http://www.designboom.com/weblog/cat/8/view/4882/riccardo-dalisi-design-ultrapoverissimo.htmlhttp://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riccardo_DalisiQuesto è un progetto di collaborazione tra quattro gruppi diversi:Make People Do Lab www.makepeopledo.itCartaelatte www.cartaelatte.it/Zabar www.zabar.it/Kuziba teatro www.facebook.com/kuziba.teatroNecessitiamo di fondi per far sì che Riccardo Dalisi sia con noi, per il trasporto di materiali e i rimborsi delle spese di viaggio per tutti gli organizzatori, per l'acquisto dei materiali che useremo nel laboratorio e per offrire una ricompensa ai gestori della masseria che ce l'hanno gentilmente concessa.Se sarete in Puglia in quelle date, vi consigliamo di passare a trovarci e partecipare ai laboratori!

<p>My greatest wish is that my art will help others connect with their deepest desires and inspire creativity and connection.  Much of the original  inspiration for the cards grew out of a teaching in Judaism about feelings being messengers or angels. However,  I hope these cards will be a touchstone and daily practice in unconventional and liberating ways for anyone, of any spiritual practice.  And maybe speak to people who don't feel an easy way into spirituality or have felt isolated in those worlds.  It's all about the joys and oyes of living.<br/></p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Story Behind the Maker</h3> <p></p>
<p>I am an artist who has been making art for quite a while now and haven't shown much work outside of close friends for a very long time.  I am launching this campaign at the same time as I am having an opening of my work at Alchemy Collective Cafe in South Berkeley. It's a big leap that makes me nervous and excited and vulnerable all at the same time. </p>
<p>I first visioned this project two and a half years ago.  At the time I had begun making art again for the first time in almost a decade.  I felt my own practice had in part fell to the side because of my own insecurities as an artist and also what I perceived as limited access to the art world.  In tandem, I was looking for a Jewish community that was in line with my feminist, queer, political identities.  Being radical in my support of peace for all Jews everywhere and Palestinian liberation,  and walking this world as a queer Jewish witch were ways I was looking to connect with Jewish community.</p>
<p>Last summer I was ordained as a Hebrew Priestess, through the Kohenet Hebrew Priestess Institute.  This has contributed to having a more earth-based, feminist community in my Jewish practice and reorient my understanding of what it means to be Jewish.</p>
<p>This project  grew out of several desires: a desire to provide access to art that is both accessible monetarily  and supportive of the artist who made it, a desire to collaborate with other artists and support them in their work and a desire to create something that would be a tool for people who like me, haven't always felt our quirky brand of beauty/magic/seekings had a place to express, explore and connect in.</p>

The aspiration for alice is to encourage and generate a movement that uses digital tools to recognize and reward “alice leadership” wherever it may be, and to inspire and support others to model ‘alice’ leadership. <p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Our project</h3><p></p><p>We are looking for support to build alice’s toolbox, an online zone to help catalyze extraordinary and every day acts of leadership. alice’s toolbox will consist of the following elements: </p><p>•<b>	A tip off tool </b>– Have you identified a crisis of leadership or a cause where collective action is stalling? The informant tool will enable the community to bring leadership failings to alice’s attention. </p><p>  •	<b>An action portal</b> – Once a number of causes or issues of poor leadership have been aggregated, alice will play the role of curator, enabling users to generate actions that combat the issues at hand. Actions will be crowd-sourced from the community and the most popular actions will be promoted by alice – and spread across the social media landscape.</p><p>•	<b>An advice community</b> – Are you facing a leadership challenge in your own work?

The aspiration for alice is to encourage and generate a movement that uses digital tools to recognize and reward “alice leadership” wherever it may be, and to inspire and support others to model ‘alice’ leadership. Our projectWe are looking for support to build alice’s toolbox, an online zone to help catalyze extraordinary and every day acts of leadership. alice’s toolbox will consist of the following elements: •	A tip off tool – Have you identified a crisis of leadership or a cause where collective action is stalling? The informant tool will enable the community to bring leadership failings to alice’s attention.   •	An action portal – Once a number of causes or issues of poor leadership have been aggregated, alice will play the role of curator, enabling users to generate actions that combat the issues at hand. Actions will be crowd-sourced from the community and the most popular actions will be promoted by alice – and spread across the social media landscape.•	An advice community – Are you facing a leadership challenge in your own work? Could you really use a piece of advice from someone who has similar experiences of driving extraordinary change?

<p></p>
<p><span>It's Dawntime at the Art Monastery Project, literally and figuratively. A group of 12 ArtMonks have just taken up residence at the baroque Convento delle Clarisse in Caramanico, Italy. The beginning of a potential 6 year collaboration, this is an exciting and essential step for the Art Monastery Project. A new home in Italy where productions can be incubated and toured over the next 6 years. A new home for the ArtMonastic Laboratory, our experiment in creativity, contemplation and community, that's guided the Project and led to our co-founding of projects like the Changemakers' Festival, just finishing its second year in Europe.</span></p>
<p>We need you - ArtMonks and supporters the world over – to help bring the new day into being.</p>
<p>During this month, we are living the monastic hour of laudes, or dawn, beginning each day together with a sunrise practice and infusing our artistic explorations with material about this magical hour. This summer's ArtMonastic Laboratory will culminate in a new dance/theater piece, 'Prime: L'Ora dell'Alba' which will tour throughout Europe in the autumn.</p>
<p>If this year is successful, the opportunities to get involved will explode – from visits or retreats to Italy, to new artistic opportunities and links with the Castle in LA – the Art Monastery's new US base.</p>

<p><span>We've already been hard at work co-fundraising with Loom Ensemble, who are some of the ArtMonks in residence this year -- and have raised over 60% of our total goal of 6200 USD. </span></p>
<p>Now it's time to call you into the circle. We need to raise another $2000 to make the fall programming come alive. Get involved by backing us with a donation, or just sharing with your network. Your donations will directly support the residency in Caramanico, and the tour and performances of Prime. </p>
<p>We've got a list of perks and rewards for you to choose from in return, but whether you get yourself a bespoke vibrator inductor synth, a personalized thank you video from one of the ArtMonks, or just decide to get involved, you'll be becoming a part of this project in an important way. </p>
<p>And for any dedicated improvisers out there: If you'd like to visit Italy this month, we'd love to have you and have a guest bed waiting for you. Please let us know if you'd like to visit our summer community, have an ArtMonk experience and join the Dawntime!<br/><br/></p>

We've got many new artists joining previous ArtMonks in a dynamic new community. Our hosts ReTe, in Caramanico are welcoming and thrilled to have us, and we've already got tour spots for the our show booked in Italy, Belgium, and Berlin. BUT in order to complete our fall season we'll need to finish our summer fundraising campaign. We believe that if this fall season is successful, many new doors will be opened, or suns will be rising (since it's Dawntime and all...). Finishing our residency strong in Caramanico will help to prepare the ground for up to 6 more years of work here, which means so many more opportunities for the entire Art Monastery Community. This is also the first AMP European tour in many years.

A site where global processes like colonialism, migration, and globalization come together, the Philippines is an ideal starting point for understanding pressing contemporary global issues, from labor migration to environmental crises. CA+T’s virtual platform presents creative and scholarly works exploring these questions through four cornerstone programs: 1) Curated Exhibitions, 2) Commissioned Works, 3) a <i>DIALOGUES</i> series of moderated, thematically-driven conversations, and 4) a one-of-a-kind Artist-in-Residence Virtual Residency program.</p><p></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Why We’re Fundraising Here</b></p><p></p><p>CA+T relies on a small, dedicated team to plan, coordinate and execute its online and offline programming, and all this programming requires money.  From the subscriptions that enable us to host a variety of media to developing partnerships with organizations to 
present exhibitions and artist and scholar talks, we’re doing <i>a lot</i> on a shoestring. </p><p>We’re applying for grants wherever we can, but many grants <b>exclude the day-to-day operational costs</b> that keep CA+T running and vibrant: the website fees and subscriptions, staff salaries, printing and postage, publicity.

From our web platform <www.centerforartandthought.org>, winner of 2013 Horizon Interactive and 2014 AVA Digital Awards, we take the Philippines and Filipinos as a point of departure for thinking culture globally. A site where global processes like colonialism, migration, and globalization come together, the Philippines is an ideal starting point for understanding pressing contemporary global issues, from labor migration to environmental crises. CA+T’s virtual platform presents creative and scholarly works exploring these questions through four cornerstone programs: 1) Curated Exhibitions, 2) Commissioned Works, 3) a DIALOGUES series of moderated, thematically-driven conversations, and 4) a one-of-a-kind Artist-in-Residence Virtual Residency program.Why We’re Fundraising HereCA+T relies on a small, dedicated team to plan, coordinate and execute its online and offline programming, and all this programming requires money.  From the subscriptions that enable us to host a variety of media to developing partnerships with organizations to 
present exhibitions and artist and scholar talks, we’re doing a lot on a shoestring. We’re applying for grants wherever we can, but many grants exclude the day-to-day operational costs that keep CA+T running and vibrant: the website fees and subscriptions, staff salaries, printing and postage, publicity. And, as a young organization, CA+T is still building a track record to make us truly competitive for the few grants that do cover general operating costs.This Is Where You Come InCA+T needs your help to pay our ordinary bills so that we can keep bringing you amazing art—like Jenifer K. Wofford’s Nurses—and scholarship—like Martin Manalansan’s essay about “the smelly immigrant”; original commissioned works, like Kat Larsen’s Deception Pass and Jeffrey Augustine Songco’s Confessional; the thought provoking DIALOGUES series, including Beyond the Horizon of Death? about the devastation of Haiyan; and the artists’ residencies, like Kim Alidio and Ronaldo Wilson’s incredible posts meditating on their projects.Funding Will Go TowardsOperational costs (the services that keep CA+T up and running)
Staff wages and editorial, web, and curatorial consultant fees
Subscription fees for Vimeo Pro, ISSUU, Soundcloud, Dropbox, and web hosting that enable CA+T to present materials online in a range of media
Online and print advertising and publicity
CA+T’s lawyer and accountant fees
Online bookkeeping and fax services
CA+T’s payroll service
Permissions costs to republish articles on CA+T’s website
Printing, shipping, and postage costs
Expenses associated with CA+T’s special projects
Equipment (projector, screens) for offline exhibits
Installation and space fees for physical venues
Honoraria and travel funds to support artists and scholars speaking at public events
Special print editions of the DIALOGUES series and for other future projects
Other limited-run CA+T productions (works on paper, photographic prints, publications).
And check out the perks!
That column to your right is comprised of amazing creative writing, scholarly monographs, edited collections, subscriptions, and original works of art. Indeed, we would not be exaggerating to say that it represents a catalog of some of the most exciting work in Filipino, Filipino American, and Asian American fields today, from both established and emerging scholars and artists. So, at the very least, browse the list to see what’s new. You can see images of the contributions on this page and in the Gallery (tab at top), and you can learn more about most contributors and items by checking out the contributor profile on CA+T’s website. If you choose to donate, not only will your donation support CA+T’s mission to bring artists, scholars and the broader public into conversation, you’ll be bringing that conversation home. (Shipping is included in the amount of the donation.)







We are overwhelmed by the generosity of the organizations and contributors who have donated items—books, subscriptions, art works—to tempt you and to thank you for your support. Before we go any further, a big shout out to everyone who made the loot possible. And remember: all donations are fully tax deductible, and you will receive an official receipt for your tax records.

<p>This illustrated alphabet started as a personal passion project. As my work started becoming more and more digital/graphic design focused, I found myself yearning to get back to my traditional artist roots. Combining my love for typography, illustration, and animals was a no-brainer – but little did I know, this labor of love would take years to complete!</p>
<p><strong>This alphabet series has been five years in the making.</strong> Partially because ""life happens,"" but also because each piece was time-consuming to hand-draw in high detail. The result is a collection of beautiful animals, each representing a different letter in the English alphabet. I'm so excited to share it with you!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601730447/fmn6ei5n15whfhvjrhdi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As I was creating the artwork, I dreamed of the day I would turn them into a children's book – <strong>Animals from A to Z</strong>. With each animal featured, there are several fun facts, each with a small illustration of their own!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601730676/oog5uiep7pt8mtrrvlpv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It's also been a dream of mine to use the book to raise money for animal welfare. Over these five years, I've become more and more interested in the way we treat the animals we share this planet with. So after a lot of research, I've decided to <strong>donate 100% of profits to The Humane League</strong>, a global nonprofit working to end the abuse of farmed animals – the most abused animals in the world.</p>
<p>The Perks will be fulfilled well before the December holiday season. </p>
<p> </p>

<p>The funding will directly go to printing the Perks, shipping, and associated fees. <strong>I will not take one penny! </strong>100% of profits will be donated. The higher the quantity of orders, the lower the print cost per item will be – and the more we can give to the animals! I will be working tirelessly to keep these expenses down to maximize the donation.</p>
<p>The artwork is available as individual letter prints (two sizes), a full alphabet poster, and of course, the book! There are also some mini stickers available, with pro-sustainability designs. All items are printed on environmentally friendly papers (no plastic/vinyl).</p>

<p>Each animal's spread includes some basic facts about them (average weight, lifespan, habitat, etc) – as well as six <strong>fun facts with unique sketch illustrations for each!</strong></p>
<p>Each copy will be hand-signed by the artist (me!) inside the front cover – Own a special, first edition of the book. The book will be tough, with thick paper to protect it from little hands. The pages and covers will be satin-coated for a soft touch, yet durable, finish.</p>
<p>The book all comes down to this:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>BEAUTY</strong><br/>See the magnificent animal world through detailed, colorful, hand-drawn illustrations.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>DISCOVERY</strong><br/>Learn fun facts about these amazing, diverse species, from the biggest bears to the smallest fish!</p>

<p>These 2"" paper stickers are an adorable way to flaunt your sustainable self. Please note, they are paper, not vinyl (no new plastic!) – so while they are quite durable, they won't be waterproof.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Printer Highlight</strong></p>
<p>I'll be using <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/indigoinkprint/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">IndigoInk</a> for the prints, posters, and stickers. They are local to me (to eliminate shipping cost), affordable, and use <a href=""https://indigoinkprint.com/company-info/eco-conscious-printing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">low eco-impact printing techniques</a>. The book printer will be Mixam, who also promotes <a href=""https://mixam.com/why"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">minimal environmental impact printing</a>, and small quantities if needed – so we can get this book printed even if orders are low.</p>
<p><strong>Sustainable Shipping</strong></p>
<p>I will make every effort to reduce waste when packing and shipping the Perks. If you receive any plastic packing material, it will be because I am recycling it from my collection (saving it from the landfill! – yes... I hoard packing material). No new plastic will be purchased for shipping, only paper if needed.</p>

<p>Your contribution will make a difference. Beyond helping me fulfill my dreams of completing this book, you'll help donate as much as possible to <strong>The Humane League</strong>. I know there are many, <strong>many </strong>good places to contribute your money with all that is going on in the world – so I am very appreciative of your support. The more books that are sold, the cheaper they are to print, which means there will be more profit per book that can be donated.</p>
<p><strong>My personal track record</strong><strong>:</strong> I have years of experience ordering printed materials and cutting costs associated with these orders. At the end of the campaign, I will gather final estimates and negotiate cost based on the final number of Perks ordered. For items printed by IndigoInk, I have already ordered proofs (samples) of each Perk to verify their gorgeous quality. I have also been running an <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/shop/dogwoodillustration"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Etsy shop</a> for years, so I am comfortable with packing &amp; shipping orders!</p>

<p><strong>It's Ready to Go!</strong></p>
<p>The artwork is 100% complete, files are prepped, printers are at the ready. All I need is the funding to hit ""submit!"" No challenges anticipated here.</p>
<p><strong>Production</strong></p>
<p>The Perks will be printed even if the funding goal is not met, because the printers allow for small quantity printing (meaning this is a ""<a href=""https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/205138007-Choose-Your-Funding-Type-Can-I-Keep-My-Money-"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">flexible</a>"" campaign). Both printers have excellent customer service and I don't anticipate any problems with production.</p>
<p><strong>Delivery</strong></p>
<p>The goal to have all Perks delivered before the December holiday season is very reasonable. The printing turnaround for all Perks will only be about one to two weeks after the campaign ends at the end of October. This gives me plenty of time to receive the Perks, verify their quality, and pack &amp; ship well before mid-December. </p>
<p><strong>COVID-19 Delays</strong></p>
<p>In our current world, there is always the possibility that coronavirus will slow things down in some way, most likely the mail. I'll do everything I can to prevent this, but if any delay comes up, you'll be the first to know.</p>
<p><strong>Possible Perks Confusion</strong></p>
<p>The way that Indiegogo handles Perks may be a bit confusing for some. Please see below if you are unfamiliar:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Choose one Perk</strong> and go to checkout (ex. a Poster)</li>
<li>
<strong>Swipe to see the multiple Add-Ons available.</strong> You can add any available options to your cart. Some options may add a couple bucks to your shipping cost due to weight.</li>
<li><strong>Check out!</strong></li>
<li>If you ordered a letter print, please remember to <strong>let me know your chosen letters!</strong> After you check out, you can either....<ul>
<li>Send me a direct message through Indiegogo</li>

<p><strong>Kate Rodman</strong></p>
<p>Hi there! – I’m a graphic designer and illustrator from Maryland. My specialty lies in brand design, especially when using illustration to strengthen those concepts. There’s really nothing else I’d rather be doing than putting together a gorgeous brand – large, medium, or small. The way that illustration can transform an abstract concept into something tangible, real, and visual will always enchant me!</p>
<p>Personally, I’ve always had a strong interest in the natural world and animals since I was a kid. As I’ve gotten older, that wonder has only gotten stronger. It wasn’t until I became an adult that I realized how well being vegan meshed with these values, and how important it was for me to “walk the talk” and remove animal suffering from my life. Now I couldn't imagine it any other way! My personal work usually revolves around these concepts. </p>

This illustrated alphabet started as a personal passion project. As my work started becoming more and more digital/graphic design focused, I found myself yearning to get back to my traditional artist roots. Combining my love for typography, illustration, and animals was a no-brainer – but little did I know, this labor of love would take years to complete!
This alphabet series has been five years in the making. Partially because ""life happens,"" but also because each piece was time-consuming to hand-draw in high detail. The result is a collection of beautiful animals, each representing a different letter in the English alphabet. I'm so excited to share it with you!

As I was creating the artwork, I dreamed of the day I would turn them into a children's book – Animals from A to Z. With each animal featured, there are several fun facts, each with a small illustration of their own!

It's also been a dream of mine to use the book to raise money for animal welfare. Over these five years, I've become more and more interested in the way we treat the animals we share this planet with. So after a lot of research, I've decided to donate 100% of profits to The Humane League, a global nonprofit working to end the abuse of farmed animals – the most abused animals in the world.
The Perks will be fulfilled well before the December holiday season. 
 


The funding will directly go to printing the Perks, shipping, and associated fees. I will not take one penny! 100% of profits will be donated. The higher the quantity of orders, the lower the print cost per item will be – and the more we can give to the animals! I will be working tirelessly to keep these expenses down to maximize the donation.
The artwork is available as individual letter prints (two sizes), a full alphabet poster, and of course, the book! There are also some mini stickers available, with pro-sustainability designs. All items are printed on environmentally friendly papers (no plastic/vinyl).
To see all the letters in close-up detail, visit the Instagram page.

 



Each animal's spread includes some basic facts about them (average weight, lifespan, habitat, etc) – as well as six fun facts with unique sketch illustrations for each!
Each copy will be hand-signed by the artist (me!) inside the front cover – Own a special, first edition of the book. The book will be tough, with thick paper to protect it from little hands. The pages and covers will be satin-coated for a soft touch, yet durable, finish.
The book all comes down to this:
BEAUTYSee the magnificent animal world through detailed, colorful, hand-drawn illustrations.
DISCOVERYLearn fun facts about these amazing, diverse species, from the biggest bears to the smallest fish!
LOVEDeepen your knowledge and respect for the animals we share our planet with!
 



The entire collection of letters comes together gorgeously on this 18x24"" poster. Perfect for a nursery, kid's room, or if you're me – prominently displayed in an office! The ""alphabet"" concept is youthful enough for little ones, while the art style is mature enough for all ages to enjoy for a lifetime. The paper is matte finish, in absolutely stunning print quality. The colors are vibrant and gorgeous in-person.
The wide range of colors in the poster means it will flatter almost any decor or color scheme!
 




Hang your child's initials/name above their bed, display your family's initials on the mantle, or maybe just send your octopus-obsessed friend a letter O!
You can have any letter as a 5x7"" or 11x14"" print! Like the poster, these are printed on uncoated (matte) paper, in gorgeous vibrant color. The stock is thick, recycled, and perfect for framing.
Because Indiegogo doesn't allow you to leave a message for me at checkout, and listing a unique Perk for each of the 26 letters would be total chaos, please be sure to send me a direct message after you check out to let me know what letters you want! If you are unable or uncomfortable with sending a message through Indiegogo, please email me: kate@dogwooddesignillustration.com. I'll make sure you get the letters you asked for!
 



These 2"" paper stickers are an adorable way to flaunt your sustainable self. Please note, they are paper, not vinyl (no new plastic!) – so while they are quite durable, they won't be waterproof.
 
Printer Highlight
I'll be using IndigoInk for the prints, posters, and stickers. They are local to me (to eliminate shipping cost), affordable, and use low eco-impact printing techniques. The book printer will be Mixam, who also promotes minimal environmental impact printing, and small quantities if needed – so we can get this book printed even if orders are low.
Sustainable Shipping
I will make every effort to reduce waste when packing and shipping the Perks. If you receive any plastic packing material, it will be because I am recycling it from my collection (saving it from the landfill! – yes... I hoard packing material). No new plastic will be purchased for shipping, only paper if needed.
 


Your contribution will make a difference. Beyond helping me fulfill my dreams of completing this book, you'll help donate as much as possible to The Humane League. I know there are many, many good places to contribute your money with all that is going on in the world – so I am very appreciative of your support. The more books that are sold, the cheaper they are to print, which means there will be more profit per book that can be donated.
My personal track record: I have years of experience ordering printed materials and cutting costs associated with these orders. At the end of the campaign, I will gather final estimates and negotiate cost based on the final number of Perks ordered. For items printed by IndigoInk, I have already ordered proofs (samples) of each Perk to verify their gorgeous quality. I have also been running an Etsy shop for years, so I am comfortable with packing & shipping orders!
 


It's Ready to Go!
The artwork is 100% complete, files are prepped, printers are at the ready. All I need is the funding to hit ""submit!"" No challenges anticipated here.
Production
The Perks will be printed even if the funding goal is not met, because the printers allow for small quantity printing (meaning this is a ""flexible"" campaign). Both printers have excellent customer service and I don't anticipate any problems with production.
Delivery
The goal to have all Perks delivered before the December holiday season is very reasonable. The printing turnaround for all Perks will only be about one to two weeks after the campaign ends at the end of October. This gives me plenty of time to receive the Perks, verify their quality, and pack & ship well before mid-December. 
COVID-19 Delays
In our current world, there is always the possibility that coronavirus will slow things down in some way, most likely the mail. I'll do everything I can to prevent this, but if any delay comes up, you'll be the first to know.
Possible Perks Confusion
The way that Indiegogo handles Perks may be a bit confusing for some. Please see below if you are unfamiliar:


Choose one Perk and go to checkout (ex. a Poster)

Swipe to see the multiple Add-Ons available. You can add any available options to your cart. Some options may add a couple bucks to your shipping cost due to weight.
Check out!
If you ordered a letter print, please remember to let me know your chosen letters! After you check out, you can either....
Send me a direct message through Indiegogo
Or, send me an email here: kate@dogwooddesignillustration.com




If anyone has any questions or needs clarifications, my door is open – feel free to message or leave a comment here!
 


If you, like so many, have been affected by the pandemic and can't financially contribute at this time, there are other ways to support!
Spread the word!
If you want to help raise funds for The Humane League, or just enjoy the artwork and know someone else who would too, please share this campaign! You never know who may be interested – some people like to get their holiday shopping done early :)
You can follow along on Instagram at @dogwooddesignillustration – an easy way to spread the word would be to share posts to your stories.
If you are interested in The Humane League, you can follow them too: @thehumaneleague!

Hi there! – I’m a graphic designer and illustrator from Maryland. My specialty lies in brand design, especially when using illustration to strengthen those concepts. There’s really nothing else I’d rather be doing than putting together a gorgeous brand – large, medium, or small. The way that illustration can transform an abstract concept into something tangible, real, and visual will always enchant me!
Personally, I’ve always had a strong interest in the natural world and animals since I was a kid. As I’ve gotten older, that wonder has only gotten stronger. It wasn’t until I became an adult that I realized how well being vegan meshed with these values, and how important it was for me to “walk the talk” and remove animal suffering from my life. Now I couldn't imagine it any other way! My personal work usually revolves around these concepts.",23.0,0,"1 Campaign

Many parents have asked me this question and I realized my answers were average at best.

Some people who are pro-fountain pens claim it helps improve handwriting and others seem to say ball-pens, micro-tips and gel pens work just fine in this day and age of advanced writing technology. Of late some educators and parents have completely discounted the importance of handwriting in the age of technology. Now who is right?</p><p>My family business has been in the <a href=""http://www.brilindia.com/product-detail/11/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">fountain pen ink</a>, fountain pens, ball pens, stationery, early-childhood education products, balance bikes and other baby &amp; children’s products space for over 54-years now. Today we are one of the very few companies that still manufactures high-quality, hand-mixed, water and dye-based fountain pen inks using a secret formula that my family has passed down and improved over 3 generations! Yes, in the age of technology, ipads and cell phones we still sell fountain pen ink in India and to fountain pen enthusiasts world-over!  Children and parents love our inks and fountain pens and we have served over 400 million of them over the years! More importantly we have been in the business to Make Living Fun for children and parents, which is our mantra.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540810544/d6a1xqk62xduzyd3ndqh.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>We decided that we must research and give customers and backers of our global handwriting movement authentic information so they take informed decisions that will help in overall development of their children. Over the years, we have been following some research globally, spoken to handwriting experts and have also studied various developmental aspects that are beneficial to children and adolescents. As Bril Inc our subsidiary in the US opens operations in 2019, we wanted to bring back the dying art of handwriting into every home in the US and world over with our inks, that have filled fountain pens that cost less than 50 cents to ones that cost more than $1000, over five decades. Our inks are loved by calligraphists and fountain pen connoisseurs in India and world over!</p><p>Back to the findings of our research on why we believe children should use traditional fountain pens from the age of 10:</p><p>This research has made us come to the conclusion that the use of traditional nib-based fountain pens with high-quality dye based ink is absolutely essential for children transitioning from pencils to pen usage.</p><p><strong>Following are the reasons why you should definitely start your children off on fountain pens and not ball pens, gel pens or micro tips, from around 10 years of age (Std. / Grade 5) to at least 16 years (Std. Grade 10):</strong></p><ul><li>
<strong>Traditional fountain pens with high-quality nibs allow children to hold the pen in the correct position.</strong> This ensures least pressure on a child’s hand and brings about awareness of grip leading to stability of writing in the long run. </li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>
<strong>Holding the pen in one position becomes essential as the flow of ink is optimum (due to abrasion of Nib) in the position used most often by the child.</strong> This brings about discipline of grip and makes writing a conscious effort leading to fine motor skills and brain development.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>
<strong>Good fountain pen ink is less viscous than other inks and offers the best flow under least pressure.</strong> Writing for long durations with a fountain pen is much easier than using ball pens and even gel pens for young children transitioning to pen use.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>
<strong>Handwriting experts and graphologists advocate the importance of handwriting and its link to overall character and personality of a human-being.</strong> While there is no direct evidence that fountain pens improve handwriting, we know for sure that it brings about conscious writing and offers <strong>the best stability-flow balance for children to develop one stable way to write over the years</strong>. While an improvement in handwriting is subjective, fountain pens by-and-large make the written word look more beautiful if children are trained properly to use them. Did you ever wonder why calligraphy pens have fountain-pen-like Nibs? It’s not a coincidence you know.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>
<strong>Fine motor skills improve.</strong> Today the Montessori method of teaching emphasizes the need to write on sand, use chalk etc. among young kids. Similarly children benefit greatly from the mindfulness that is required while using fountain pens, and also from the slight friction when the nib touches paper if they happen to change their grip (knowingly or unknowingly).</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>
<strong>Learning to write with a fountain pen takes practice and this helps children become more patient, write slower and work on this very important life-skill constantly as they go through school.</strong> Patience is a virtue that is quickly disappearing in a world of instant-gratification. Research shows delayed gratification during childhood has a direct correlation with success and happiness in adult life.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>
<strong>Handwriting that is stable and legible will help children communicate what they learn and know to the world better, with ease and confidence.</strong> Simply put legible handwriting helps even smart children score more in exams. Fountain pens definitely make children write with more self-awareness, confidence and take pride in their writing. Self-awareness and enjoying one’s work are by-far the most important aspects of education and long-term success in any field.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>
<strong>Conscious, mindful writing happens best with a fountain pen and this reduces mistakes and scratching.</strong> Laying an emphasis on the process and slowly improving the outcome is more important than ever today, as children grow up with Delete, Backspace, Whatsapps and Snapchats. We love technology, and children learn a lot from it, but let us not nurture a generation that only believes in things that gratify instantly and mindless, grammatically incorrect modes of communication.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>
<strong>It’s more Economical and Environment Friendly!</strong> While fountain pens for students cost more than the cheap ball point pens and gel pens, they last for years. One bottle of 60 ml (2.02 Oz) ink lasts anywhere between 6 months and one year. So a small investment takes you a long way and saves families a fair bit of money. Moreover fountain pens are not use-and-throw, so children are forced to keep them carefully and indirectly help in saving the environment. A subtle lesson in valuing what they have and also not contributing to more plastic waste by disposing ball point pens and refills maybe? Our study and talks with parents revealed that on average an Indian student disposes 7 ball-point pens a year! Imagine the plastic waste we can avoid with fountain pens with approximately 1 billion 7-17 year-olds in school (Figure extrapolated from UNESCO's website)!</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>
<strong>It’s Fun!</strong> Don’t we all remember swishing and splashing ink on our friends’ shirts using our fountain pens? Anything that aids in playing a fun prank will never go out of fashion with kids! Now if that doesn’t Make Living Fun what will?</li></ul><p><strong>Never forget that handwriting is a person’s unique identity, it is an art form and this needs to be nurtured with care and not treated as frivolously as typing.</strong> Even the beautiful fonts in our iPads and computers were created by artists who studied calligraphy (Steve Jobs too was inspired by meditation and a calligraphy course he took). There is no substitute to learning an art form, as art is food for the soul and hence if we are to avoid drastic evolutionary rewiring, introduce your children to fountain pens in their formative years (i.e. when their school asks them to transition from pencil to pen or from 10 years of age if you are home-schooling your child).</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540821250/mv7yrzq4fljopxanzcwn.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>While we were at it, we realized that over the last 5-6 years, some schools in Europe ( <a href=""https://www.spectator.co.uk/2015/03/the-return-of-the-fountain-pen/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.spectator.co.uk/2015/03/the-return-of-the-fountain-pen/ </a>) have gone back to making fountain pens compulsory.

Self-awareness and enjoying one’s work are by-far the most important aspects of education and long-term success in any field. 
Conscious, mindful writing happens best with a fountain pen and this reduces mistakes and scratching. Laying an emphasis on the process and slowly improving the outcome is more important than ever today, as children grow up with Delete, Backspace, Whatsapps and Snapchats. We love technology, and children learn a lot from it, but let us not nurture a generation that only believes in things that gratify instantly and mindless, grammatically incorrect modes of communication. 
It’s more Economical and Environment Friendly! While fountain pens for students cost more than the cheap ball point pens and gel pens, they last for years. One bottle of 60 ml (2.02 Oz) ink lasts anywhere between 6 months and one year. So a small investment takes you a long way and saves families a fair bit of money. Moreover fountain pens are not use-and-throw, so children are forced to keep them carefully and indirectly help in saving the environment. A subtle lesson in valuing what they have and also not contributing to more plastic waste by disposing ball point pens and refills maybe? Our study and talks with parents revealed that on average an Indian student disposes 7 ball-point pens a year! Imagine the plastic waste we can avoid with fountain pens with approximately 1 billion 7-17 year-olds in school (Figure extrapolated from UNESCO's website)! 
It’s Fun! Don’t we all remember swishing and splashing ink on our friends’ shirts using our fountain pens? Anything that aids in playing a fun prank will never go out of fashion with kids! Now if that doesn’t Make Living Fun what will?Never forget that handwriting is a person’s unique identity, it is an art form and this needs to be nurtured with care and not treated as frivolously as typing. Even the beautiful fonts in our iPads and computers were created by artists who studied calligraphy (Steve Jobs too was inspired by meditation and a calligraphy course he took). There is no substitute to learning an art form, as art is food for the soul and hence if we are to avoid drastic evolutionary rewiring, introduce your children to fountain pens in their formative years (i.e. when their school asks them to transition from pencil to pen or from 10 years of age if you are home-schooling your child).While we were at it, we realized that over the last 5-6 years, some schools in Europe ( https://www.spectator.co.uk/2015/03/the-return-of-the-fountain-pen/ ) have gone back to making fountain pens compulsory. While embracing the latest gadgets is important, let us not do away with timeless know-how and make our children use traditional fountain pens at least for a few years from the year they transition from pencils to pens.You will be surprised that schools in many countries still insist on fountain pen usage and that is indeed the way to go, if we truly care about how the art of handwriting helps in developing neural connections and brain-development!  http://www.fountainpennetwork.com/forum/topic/209860-in-what-locales-are-fountain-pens-still-required-in-school/Here is a very interesting article in The Economist about the importance of handwriting: https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2016/09/06/the-comeback-of-cursiveBackers get to choose from our amazing perks!

<h3><b>Hello and welcome! :)</b></h3>
<p>First, I want to thank you for finding your way to my crowdfunding campaign and for taking your time for reading this.</p>
<p>My name Is Katrin. Better known as @Jarlie86 on social media, like Twitter and Instagram. I'm 28 years old and I live in germany.  I'm an artist and illustrator with all of my heart and I'm working as a freelancer.</p>
<p>I'm an artist since I was able to hold a pencil in my hands and all I've learned about art, I taught myself. I worked for some agencies and as an Art teacher for children. Since a few months, I'm working hard to do my very own thing. I draw and paint portraits, mostly of actors and musicians and started to make products of my Artworks. But I'm also into digital works, children's book illustration, making sculptures and urban art. I like to call myself as an ""creative allrounder"". <br/></p>
<p>Art is my life, heart and soul and I spend all my time to keep doing what I love and for making my fans, and fans of different fandoms happy. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>What I need</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1084458/files/20141209134738-crowdfunding.png?1418161658"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In order
to be able to continue growing in my art and to put my creative
career as an artist on a new level, there are a few things I need.
Because I want to be able, to produce the products (Merchandise) on
my own at home. This would change my life completely, because I would
be able to create professional products by myself at home. It's really expensive to let companies produce products with your works, and I wouldn't just get percents of any
sales, I would get the whole money. I would be able to build up an amazing shop and business with my works. For this I need a 5 in 1 Heat Press (I can use this amazing machine as a T-Shirt
 press, mug press, cap and plate press. <br/></p>
<p>I can print my 
works on almost everything. Pillows, phone/tablet/laptop cases, 
keychains, and many many more!). I also need an electric Vinyl Cutter (for cutting out every 
design automatically I create. Precise!), a special Printer  for sublimation prints (+ special Ink), Sublimation Paper and heat roles. Together with lots of different blank Sublimation items*, like T-Shirts in different sizes and colors, mugs, keychains, pillows, plates and so on. This starterset, it would give me a 'Kickstart'! </p>
<p>To get my own business run, I also need a professional Badge machine. My art looks really cute on those badges. I have a small one, only able to create little badges in one size. With the new Badge machine, I would be able to create (needle) badges in four different sizes, plus magnets and even pocket mirrors! I would be in aawww :) For this machine, I will need blank badgets/magnets/mirrors, but they will last for a long time.</p>
<p>The last machine I need is a calendar bind machine. It's really expensive to let companies produce calendars with your designs and with this machine, I would be able to do it at home, professional,by myself. </p>
<p>You would help me so so much with every cent you spend on my creative career! It would open oppurtunities, I just dreamt since such a long time. I would be able to keep being a freelancer and to do what I love the most: Doing Art. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Overview: <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>- 5 in 1 Heat Press , A Vinyl Cutter, a special Printer, accesoires, blank sublimation items*, paper, ink  – approximately 2000 euros (including international shipping).<br/></p>
<p>- Professional Badge  machine (+ accesoires) - approximately 400 euros</p>
<p>- Calendar bind machine -  100 euros</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>What if I don’t reach the target?</b></p>
<p>I will set the money aside until I have earned enough. I won't use it otherway for sure (why should I ? My dream is to have all these equipment!)</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What You Get</b><br/></p>
<ul></ul> <p>Artworks ! :) I would love to fly to everyone who spend money into my creative future, to give you a big hug, but we all know that it's not possible :)I'm an artist and there's nothing more personal than my Artworks that I can give to you from me. </p>
<p>I have different Perks, from 1 Euro up to 500 Euro. From smaller and bigger ArtPrints, up to original artworks and custom drawings (by a ref pic of your choice).

<p>Any extra money received
go to more professional online Promotion and Advertising, like promoting
 my Facebook site and for getting my works 'offline' into magazines, 
newspaper for example, or for rent a room to do an Art Show. For my 
customers, I just use the best and finest art supplies. I work a lot 
with copic markers and professional coloured pencils. My way to paint 
with copics (especially) portraits is unique and famous by so many 
people out there. But the Various Ink to refill them, is really pretty 
expensive. So I would buy more 
art supplies to keep the quality of my Artworks. Extra money would also 
get into a new graphic tablet for my digital designs and for other art 
supplies like acrylics, brushes, portfolio folders, blank skatedecks ( I
 paint them too), sketchbooks, paper, and so on and so forth.<br/></p>

 press, mug press, cap and plate press. 
I can print my 
works on almost everything. Pillows, phone/tablet/laptop cases, 
keychains, and many many more!). I also need an electric Vinyl Cutter (for cutting out every 
design automatically I create. Precise!), a special Printer  for sublimation prints (+ special Ink), Sublimation Paper and heat roles. Together with lots of different blank Sublimation items*, like T-Shirts in different sizes and colors, mugs, keychains, pillows, plates and so on. This starterset, it would give me a 'Kickstart'! 
To get my own business run, I also need a professional Badge machine. My art looks really cute on those badges. I have a small one, only able to create little badges in one size. With the new Badge machine, I would be able to create (needle) badges in four different sizes, plus magnets and even pocket mirrors! I would be in aawww :) For this machine, I will need blank badgets/magnets/mirrors, but they will last for a long time.
The last machine I need is a calendar bind machine. It's really expensive to let companies produce calendars with your designs and with this machine, I would be able to do it at home, professional,by myself. 
You would help me so so much with every cent you spend on my creative career! It would open oppurtunities, I just dreamt since such a long time. I would be able to keep being a freelancer and to do what I love the most: Doing Art. 



Overview: 

- 5 in 1 Heat Press , A Vinyl Cutter, a special Printer, accesoires, blank sublimation items*, paper, ink  – approximately 2000 euros (including international shipping).
- Professional Badge  machine (+ accesoires) - approximately 400 euros
- Calendar bind machine -  100 euros

What if I don’t reach the target?
I will set the money aside until I have earned enough. I won't use it otherway for sure (why should I ? My dream is to have all these equipment!)


What You Get
 Artworks ! :) I would love to fly to everyone who spend money into my creative future, to give you a big hug, but we all know that it's not possible :)I'm an artist and there's nothing more personal than my Artworks that I can give to you from me. 
I have different Perks, from 1 Euro up to 500 Euro. From smaller and bigger ArtPrints, up to original artworks and custom drawings (by a ref pic of your choice). I have a lot of Sherlock related Artpieces (Benedict Cumberbatch, Martin Freeman, Amanda Abbington, Mark Gatiss, Andrew Scott, and so on). but also other artists like Ed Sheeran, Samu Haber (Sunrise Avenue), Rea Garvey,...
All Artworks, prints or original pieces, -won't- come with Watermarks for sure !!

Any extra money received
go to more professional online Promotion and Advertising, like promoting
 my Facebook site and for getting my works 'offline' into magazines, 
newspaper for example, or for rent a room to do an Art Show. For my 
customers, I just use the best and finest art supplies. I work a lot 
with copic markers and professional coloured pencils. My way to paint 
with copics (especially) portraits is unique and famous by so many 
people out there. But the Various Ink to refill them, is really pretty 
expensive. So I would buy more 
art supplies to keep the quality of my Artworks. Extra money would also 
get into a new graphic tablet for my digital designs and for other art 
supplies like acrylics, brushes, portfolio folders, blank skatedecks ( I
 paint them too), sketchbooks, paper, and so on and so forth.

 Risks & Challenges
Please keep in mind
that creating a custom artwork takes time. I will not be able to ship your
drawing within a week of the campaign closing. If you need your drawing for a special date, please ask me before contributing and picking that perk.
  

Other Ways
You Can Help
Please, spread the word ! ""Share"" and/or ""retweet"" on  social media. Share it

<h3>The Why:</h3>
<p>In 2015, my sister had her first son. As a gift to him, I painted a watercolor alphabet made of animals. Each animal forms the shape of the letter it represents and is accompanied by a rhythmic word set to encourage reading, vocabulary building, and fun!</p>

<h3>The How:</h3>
<p>My goal is to reach $500. This will cover the first 50 books and shipping costs. The sales from these books will allow me to print more and expand the ABC collection. I have 3 more children alphabet books in the works (and one for adults!)</p>
<p>If you donate $20, you will receive my everlasting appreciation and an autographed copy of the book.</p>

<p>Playa Moon is a 65’ spherical projection screen. Each night of

the playa.</p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436167810/frsn5xkoooof50gczpjl.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b><a href=""http://do-more-now.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Do-More-Now</a> </b>is a camp of experienced Burners with a multi-year proven
track record of bringing innovative, inspiring, and larger than life projects
to Burning Man including the <b>5-story Firehouse, Cervantes, Starlight, Escher,</b> the
2,500 ft<sup>2</sup> Escher Puzzle, and the<b> Clown Shoe</b>. This year the team is bringing
Playa Moon to light up the desert night. </p>
<p><b>Bringing Playa Moon to Burning Man 2015</b></p>
<p>As with any grand plan,
bringing Play Moon to Burning Man requires vision, elbow grease, a bunch of
crazy people, and, of course a certain amount of money. The team has already
procured the structure, pumps and basic anchors, but is looking to raise funds
for additional costs and considerations. These include:</p><p></p><p><b><i>Transport
&amp; Fuel</i></b></p>
<p>o<span> 
</span>The Playa Moon with
all of assorted accessories requires a truck and a trailer to move it 700 miles
to the playa and back again.</p>
<p>o<span> 
</span>We will also need fuel
for the pumps to make Playa Moon rise. Estimated transportation and fuel costs:
$1,500.</p><p><b><i>Anchoring
</i></b></p>
<p>o<span> 
</span>An inflatable this
size requires a very heavy duty additional anchoring system to ensure the
Playa Moon stays exactly where we put it. Estimated anchoring costs: $1,500.</p>
<p><b><i>Lights
&amp; Projection </i></b></p>
<p>o<span> 
</span>Additional lighting
and controls to create a hypnotic light show.</p>
<p><b>Stretch
Goals &amp; Flexible Funding</b></p>
<p>The basics are nice,
but we’ve set a few stretch goals for this project.</p><p><b style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'><i>Stretch Goal 1</i></b><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>: If we exceed
our initial goal, we will add basic projectors and project images onto the
sphere.</span></p>
<p><b><i>Stretch Goal 2:</i></b> This is the goal for reaching
our ultimate vision. Adding even more lights and higher quality projection to
create stunning coordinated effects and video treatments sure to inspire even
the crustiest of Burners. </p>
<p><b><i>Flexible Funding</i></b>: In the event that we do not
meet our initial goal, funds will be used first to fulfill perks, and subsidize
safety &amp; transport costs. Any amount raised above those costs will go to fuel
and lighting. </p>

What is Playa Moon?
Playa Moon is a 65’ spherical projection screen. Each night of
Burning Man the Playa Moon will be inflated, rising from the desert floor to cast a
6-story hypnotic combination of lights and images that will be visible across
the playa.Do-More-Now is a camp of experienced Burners with a multi-year proven
track record of bringing innovative, inspiring, and larger than life projects
to Burning Man including the 5-story Firehouse, Cervantes, Starlight, Escher, the
2,500 ft2 Escher Puzzle, and the Clown Shoe. This year the team is bringing
Playa Moon to light up the desert night. 
Bringing Playa Moon to Burning Man 2015
As with any grand plan,
bringing Play Moon to Burning Man requires vision, elbow grease, a bunch of
crazy people, and, of course a certain amount of money. The team has already
procured the structure, pumps and basic anchors, but is looking to raise funds
for additional costs and considerations. These include:Transport
& Fuel
o 
The Playa Moon with
all of assorted accessories requires a truck and a trailer to move it 700 miles
to the playa and back again.
o 
We will also need fuel
for the pumps to make Playa Moon rise. Estimated transportation and fuel costs:
$1,500.Anchoring

o 
An inflatable this
size requires a very heavy duty additional anchoring system to ensure the
Playa Moon stays exactly where we put it. Estimated anchoring costs: $1,500.
Lights
& Projection 
o 
Additional lighting
and controls to create a hypnotic light show.
Stretch
Goals & Flexible Funding
The basics are nice,
but we’ve set a few stretch goals for this project.Stretch Goal 1: If we exceed
our initial goal, we will add basic projectors and project images onto the
sphere.
Stretch Goal 2: This is the goal for reaching
our ultimate vision. Adding even more lights and higher quality projection to
create stunning coordinated effects and video treatments sure to inspire even
the crustiest of Burners. 
Flexible Funding: In the event that we do not
meet our initial goal, funds will be used first to fulfill perks, and subsidize
safety & transport costs. Any amount raised above those costs will go to fuel
and lighting.

<p>The concept of the sculpture is based on an ancient global tradition of respecting and recognizing a tree as a sentient being. Through-out time, cultures from across the world wrote messages and wishes, hanging them on special trees with an offering in an attempt to gain good graces and wisdom. </p>
<p>Today, many of us are less connected with Nature. The life force of our planet is often seen as something to be consumed. As a result, it seems we humans have a destructive and fragile relationship with our environment. <i>The Wishing Tree</i> invites us to consider reconnecting to the earth by making a healing wish for our world and for each other<br/></p>

<p><br/><i>The Wishing Tree</i> was conceived as a social experiment in connectivity and as a place to resonate with others through shared desires, vulnerabilities, humor, beauty and above all, calls for peace and harmony.

<p><b>Kate Raudenbush</b> is a New York-based, Burning Man-bred artist. Her large-scale allegorical environments are created as a set-piece to catalyze human connection and social dialogue. <br/><br/>Referencing history, geometry, spiritual mythology, and biology to inform the narrative of her work, she utilizes welded laser-cut steel, mirror, and light to shape her concepts into large-scale, climbable, enveloping environments and sacred spaces that invite both intellectual curiosity and visitor exploration. In this way, the artwork is not just an object to behold, but also an experience to be lived and learned from. <br/><br/>A self-taught sculpture artist, Kate’s work and words have been published widely and seen in art museums from Seoul to Reno, in art fairs from Miami to the Hamptons, and in festivals from Amsterdam to Las Vegas, Santiago, New York City and many epic fiery gatherings of Burning Man.<br/></p>

The Wishing Tree is an interactive 30-foot tall laser-cut steel illuminated willow tree holding thousands of inscribable silver leaves cascading down from three levels to form a canopy of wishes from around the world. This sculpture was installed on three different continents in 2014, and is designed to provide her visitors with an artistic point of connection for linking themselves to people in other cultures, exploring the common wishes we all share, and fostering empathy for one another and our Earth. 



The concept of the sculpture is based on an ancient global tradition of respecting and recognizing a tree as a sentient being. Through-out time, cultures from across the world wrote messages and wishes, hanging them on special trees with an offering in an attempt to gain good graces and wisdom. 
Today, many of us are less connected with Nature. The life force of our planet is often seen as something to be consumed. As a result, it seems we humans have a destructive and fragile relationship with our environment. The Wishing Tree invites us to consider reconnecting to the earth by making a healing wish for our world and for each other

Photos of Wishing Tree in Santiago, Chile in 2014 below: 








The Wishing Tree was conceived as a social experiment in connectivity and as a place to resonate with others through shared desires, vulnerabilities, humor, beauty and above all, calls for peace and harmony. Because it was originally created as a global sculpture that toured, it has become an emissary of good will, and a safe, peaceful gathering space at each festival.  Please join us at the Heart and Mind Festival as we welcome the Wishing Tree into our midst and celebrate our connection to Nature.


The Wishing Tree sculpture has recently completed a first world-tour with the Mysteryland Festival, starting in Bethel Woods, NY on the site of the original Woodstock Festival at Yasgur's Farm and then being shipped over to Amsterdam, Netherlands to the longest running electronic music and arts festival in Europe, and finally to Santiago, Chile.

About artist Kate Raudenbush





Kate Raudenbush is a New York-based, Burning Man-bred artist. Her large-scale allegorical environments are created as a set-piece to catalyze human connection and social dialogue. Referencing history, geometry, spiritual mythology, and biology to inform the narrative of her work, she utilizes welded laser-cut steel, mirror, and light to shape her concepts into large-scale, climbable, enveloping environments and sacred spaces that invite both intellectual curiosity and visitor exploration. In this way, the artwork is not just an object to behold, but also an experience to be lived and learned from. A self-taught sculpture artist, Kate’s work and words have been published widely and seen in art museums from Seoul to Reno, in art fairs from Miami to the Hamptons, and in festivals from Amsterdam to Las Vegas, Santiago, New York City and many epic fiery gatherings of Burning Man.

The Heart and Mind Festival

This sculpture will be installed in Ellenville, NY for the Heart and Mind Festival put on by the Golden Drum community and Sacred Arts Research Foundation that are based out of Brooklyn, NY. Heart and Mind Festival is in its third year as a shamanic healing and tribal arts festival that aims to bring together a global synthesis of visionary artists, spiritual practitioners, healers, musicians, activists, and elders in a gathering to share self-expression, arts, wisdom, healing ceremony, and a global representation of spiritual traditions in the service of higher consciousness and community. 
The Heart and Mind Festival will take place on a beautiful piece of land purchased last year by the Golden Drum community in the serene forests surrounding Ellenville, NY two hours outside of New York City.

What will this funding empower?

The funding from this indigogo campaign will go entirely to pay for the machinery needed to install and deinstall this massive sculpture along with expenses to cover materials to create new leaves for participants to write on, which require laser-cutting due to the shape and number needed. Kate and a dedicated team of volunteers from Golden Drum will be giving five days of intense physical labor to install this sculpture as an act of community service as an offering to the festival. 

This is ordinarily a very expensive piece to install where many workers and the artist are paid but a shared vision by Kate and Golden Drum has come together where we felt called to build this piece entirely on volunteer labor due to it's message of global healing and community. We are aiming to build this piece solely to inspire, transform, move, heal, empower, and unite people while staying true to a core value that art is deeply sacred and NOT a commodity. 

The Perks!
Rewards for helping  us pass on this powerful message of peace, harmony, compassion, healing, connection to nature, and community to the world by supporting our campaign!

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hi. My name is Gary

<p>I have been
operating in the Product Development arena for over 20 years now but have never
developed anything for myself!</p>
<p>I am about to

Carafe to the world. This is a patent pending design that I know will be of
huge benefit to the wine drinkers of the world.</p>

<p>Those that have
spent time learning how to fully appreciate wine understand that letting red
wine aerate to oxidize the high tannin content is important to fully appreciate
the more subtle flavors in a good bottle of wine.</p>
<p>However, to allow
the full flavor of a young red wine to develop by having your wine “breathe”
for an hour or more also makes the wine vulnerable to insects such as dreaded
fruit fly, which can easily gain access through the opened bottle of wine.</p>
<p>As you anticipate
enjoying your wine after a long day at work or enjoying time with friends, have
the peace of mind knowing that your wine is being protected with the air
carafe. The protective mesh allows air to enter in freely and keeps any bugs,
dust, and other particulates out of your delicious red wine.</p>
<p>Be assured that the
sturdy, long lasting design will allow you to fully enjoy your red wine as well
as certain white wines to an even greater degree for many years to come. </p>
<p>Take a moment to
watch the video above in order to visually see what a great solution the Air
Carafe is for allowing your wine to breathe.</p>
<h2>Development</h2>
<p>I have taken the
design to the point where I have machined a prototype from ABS plastic
material.</p>

<p>Kalos Eidos is inspired by the hypnotizing visual
evolution of a kaleidoscope and its dependence on human interaction. The main
objective is to create a conversation between sight and touch within a site
specific installation. This project has been designed to accommodate
collaborations with independent artists and our aim is to provide an
opportunity for artists to take part in Nuit Blanche through the Kalos Eidos
project, and in turn receive exposure. </p>
<p>Kalos Eidos has been formally accepted as an
Independent Project by Scotiabank Nuit Blanche, and will be appearing in all
print and online media associated with the City of Toronto. In conjunction with
the Toronto School of Art, the project hopes to transform the South West corner

Kalos Eidos is inspired by the hypnotizing visual
evolution of a kaleidoscope and its dependence on human interaction. The main
objective is to create a conversation between sight and touch within a site
specific installation. This project has been designed to accommodate
collaborations with independent artists and our aim is to provide an
opportunity for artists to take part in Nuit Blanche through the Kalos Eidos
project, and in turn receive exposure. 
Kalos Eidos has been formally accepted as an
Independent Project by Scotiabank Nuit Blanche, and will be appearing in all
print and online media associated with the City of Toronto. In conjunction with
the Toronto School of Art, the project hopes to transform the South West corner
of Bloor and Dufferin on October 4th, 2014.

The Scrollture Vision: To
bring forth an exciting new platform for individuals to create meaningful
artwork and cement precious moments upon. 








Scrollture, LLC helps you create artwork on an
innovative canvas designed to resemble a scroll (the Scroll
Canvas).  These art pieces do everything
from inscribing sacred text, to sharing artistic visions; from completing a room’s
ambiance, to celebrating life’s treasured moments.  Through our graphic services and on-demand
printing, customers can capture thoughts, ideas, or any significant moment and
have it laid on canvas.  As a cost-effective competitor to stretched canvas and framing, the Scroll Canvas offers new depths
to canvased work, and can transform artwork not just in presentation, but also
meaning.


The Scroll Canvas. . . A Viable AlternativeStretched canvas and framing has been
the dominating platforms for canvased artwork with no viable alternative ways to
present artwork on canvas. . . until now!Framing provides great aesthetic enhancement to your artwork, but
it is also EXTREMELY expensive. 
Stretched canvas is a more cost effective platform, yet it does not do
much to enhance the presentation of your artwork. The scroll canvas rivals
stretched canvas in cost and aesthetically enhances your artwork in ways that
stretcher bars simply cannot. Plus, this beautiful platform captures the sacred
essence of your work. The scroll canvas platform is made of high quality artist canvas attached to scroll rods. Prints are
made using the giclee’ process - the highest standard in digital fine-art printing.  End Caps/Finials are added to the end of the rods to enhance the
presentation of the artwork printed on the scroll, much like the frame design enhances the presentation of framed artwork.  As framers provide a multitude of frame
styles and colors to choose from, Scrollture provides a myriad of styles and finishes for you to select.
   The Cap
Series


The Cap
Series consists of the standard caps provided to customers.  These end caps are made of wood and will come
in a host of finishes, which will include white, black, mahogany, warm oak,
bronze, and gold.
   The Classic
Series


The Classic Series is a collection of wood and resin finials with a classic look.  A variety of styles are provided with
finishes including white, black, mahogany, warm oak, bronze, and gold.

Eighth Generation</b></p>
Eighth
Generation is a Seattle-based small business, founded when Louie Gong
(Nooksack) began customizing shoes with cultural art. In seven years, Eighth
Generation has grown into a brand recognized for products that showcase art
created by ""Inspired Natives."" Now we’re about to launch our first
line of beautiful, high quality, 100% wool blankets designed by Native artists.
We’re asking for your support as we move into this
exciting and important new phase in our company’s development.<br/><p></p><p></p><p><b>With
your support, Eighth Generation will become the gold standard for Native wool
blankets!</b></p>
<p>The wool blanket holds a prominent place in Native
communities, often given as gifts or awarded in ceremonies to honor
individuals. Historically, though, the only producers of wool blankets are
non-Native companies who have frequently chosen to appropriate cultural art
instead of collaborating with cultural artists. It’s time to change that. We’re
about to become the first ever Native-owned company to offer wool blankets.</p><p><b>When

Eighth Generation
Eighth
Generation is a Seattle-based small business, founded when Louie Gong
(Nooksack) began customizing shoes with cultural art. In seven years, Eighth
Generation has grown into a brand recognized for products that showcase art
created by ""Inspired Natives."" Now we’re about to launch our first
line of beautiful, high quality, 100% wool blankets designed by Native artists.
We’re asking for your support as we move into this
exciting and important new phase in our company’s development.With
your support, Eighth Generation will become the gold standard for Native wool
blankets!
The wool blanket holds a prominent place in Native
communities, often given as gifts or awarded in ceremonies to honor
individuals. Historically, though, the only producers of wool blankets are
non-Native companies who have frequently chosen to appropriate cultural art
instead of collaborating with cultural artists. It’s time to change that. We’re
about to become the first ever Native-owned company to offer wool blankets.When
you contribute to this campaign, your dollars will:


Help us compete with more established businesses by
adding our first full time staffer - a marketing and sales specialist - to the Eighth Generation team;


Recoup a portion of the cost of our initial collaborative blanket
with Evergreen State College's Longhouse, which was covered by Eighth Generation.  The blanket honoring the Longhouse's
20th year of service to the community will be used for giveaways and fundraising
by the Longhouse;


Set a precedent for Native-owned companies to be the
leading producers of art featuring Native designs;


Support the continuation of traditional Native arts and
practices;


Support the development of business experience within
tribal communities.


Thank you for your consideration. Every dollar donated will
help establish Eighth Generation as a Native-owned, community-engaged source
for wool blankets.
For
your generous contribution, you’ll receive:

$10: Digital thank-you note with a virtual tour of the Eighth Generation studio


$25: Personalized thank-you card with a design by Louie Gong or one of our Inspired Natives artists$50: Hardwood paddle pendant, hand-painted and laser-etched. Signed with a Thank You note on the reverse side.  Approximately 4"" x 5"".




$100: Eighth Generation t-shirt, plus a limited edition variety pack of shoe art stickers$125: Eighth Generation's ""Transformation"" Throw Blanket by Michelle Lowden (Acoma Pueblo)$200: Limited edition ""Hummingbird Moon"" serigraph art print (15"" x 20""), signed and numbered by artist Louie Gong


$350: Salish pattern blanket (Only 50 available in a box signed to your specifications). We will get in touch with you via email at the end of the campaign.


$500: Evergreen State College Longhouse blanket with signed box
(only 50 available!)

$1000: One-hour Skype presentation with Louie Gong at the Eighth Generation studio for you and a small group


$5000: Two-hour studio visit or Skype-based consultation for up-and-coming artists or other interested parties (for up to 25 people)

Collective has been on a mission to strengthen the community through the arts. Being the creative minds that we are, our efforts have been diverse and dynamic. We have hosted benefits for community arts organizations and programs like the Geneva Theater Guild, The Smith Center for the Arts and the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Geneva’s Teen Center music program. We have sponsored monthly events that promote cultural vibrancy in our community and provide opportunities for artists and performers to share their work. We have also facilitated after school music programs at the Phelps Community Center, The Boys &amp; Girls Club of Geneva’s Teen Center and the Geneva City School District Head Start summer program.<br/></p><p><span>            These efforts continue to be a focus for us, but we feel the need to increase our impact and serve the greater community. By mobilizing our members to be active in the community through service and volunteering, we will inspire pride of place and enhance public spaces while promoting creative growth and better citizenship. The concept is simple: members of the U.G. Collective will be required to volunteer a minimum of 24 hours a year. For every hour served members will earn credits that can be redeemed for various offers by The U.G. Collective. Offerings include but are not limited to: workshops, presentations, one on one lessons, discounts to local businesses, U.G. apparel and much more.

Things like a website that will help us communicate with our members and share our efforts with you and your friends. Or the maintenance of equipment that’s constantly used for programming and community events.

Collective has been on a mission to strengthen the community through the arts. Being the creative minds that we are, our efforts have been diverse and dynamic. We have hosted benefits for community arts organizations and programs like the Geneva Theater Guild, The Smith Center for the Arts and the Boys & Girls Club of Geneva’s Teen Center music program. We have sponsored monthly events that promote cultural vibrancy in our community and provide opportunities for artists and performers to share their work. We have also facilitated after school music programs at the Phelps Community Center, The Boys & Girls Club of Geneva’s Teen Center and the Geneva City School District Head Start summer program.            These efforts continue to be a focus for us, but we feel the need to increase our impact and serve the greater community. By mobilizing our members to be active in the community through service and volunteering, we will inspire pride of place and enhance public spaces while promoting creative growth and better citizenship. The concept is simple: members of the U.G. Collective will be required to volunteer a minimum of 24 hours a year. For every hour served members will earn credits that can be redeemed for various offers by The U.G. Collective. Offerings include but are not limited to: workshops, presentations, one on one lessons, discounts to local businesses, U.G. apparel and much more. Your contribution will help us build the infrastructure needed to move us forward and inspire a community to work and grow together.To you from meTo my friends and family,            It’s easy for some of us to forget all of the behind the scenes efforts of a musical when we are watching from a seat in the Smith Opera House. Hours spent rehearsing, building sets, the stage crew backstage and the tech crew running lights and sound. Like a musical, there are many things needed to move the U.G. Collective forward. Things like a website that will help us communicate with our members and share our efforts with you and your friends. Or the maintenance of equipment that’s constantly used for programming and community events. The fact is, this campaign goal is a fraction of what we need to provide a year of quality programming, creative community engagement and to sustain this initiative. But every dollar counts and will be put towards what the Board of Directors deems essential to the progress of this organization.           Our goal for this campaign is $5,000. This would be a much needed springboard into 2014 as we launch the “Beyond Music, Art & Culture” initiative. This initiative will increase community engagement through service with our members, connect volunteer opportunities to willing and able bodies as well as provide opportunities for creative and personal growth. Things like branding, operating efficiency and capacity building can be taken for granted from an outsiders perspective. But they are necessary pieces needed to grow our organization and bring our vision of strengthening the community through arts to fruition.           The efforts of the U.G.

<p>We are WCA – Women’s Caucus for Art, a 41-year old arts &amp; activism <strong>volunteer-run</strong> not-for-profit organization, which has also been an NGO of the United Nations since 1975. We have 1200+ members nationwide. The President of LuXun Academy of Fine Arts in Shenyang, <strong>China</strong> invited our International Caucus group to create an art-based <strong>cultural exchange</strong> with Chinese women artists. This exciting project will take place at the Academy in April 2014! Eighteen of us are actively developing this exchange and exhibition. We need your help to succeed.</p>
<p>The project is titled <strong>Half the Sky: Intersections in Social Practice Art</strong></p>
<p><em>(wondering what Social Practice Art is??? - you are not alone – keep reading!)</em></p>
<p>We really need your help!  </p>
<ul>
<li>to subsidize travel for the delegation of WCA members who will</li>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>share</strong> our lives through our universal artist perspectives</li>
<li>
<strong>explore</strong> contemporary art practice in different cultures</li>
<li>
<strong>build community</strong> with Chinese women artists in Shenyang</li>
<li>
<strong>encourage</strong> mutual <strong>understanding </strong>in ways that <strong>transcend</strong> language barriers</li>
</ul>
<li>to purchase technology to support the events developed by our American delegation</li>
<li>to create the catalog that will include the art works and essays from US art historians and writers</li>
</ul>
<p>Women artists and writers throughout history have received little or no acknowledgement or compensation, and have had to shoulder many of their own costs.</p>
<p>We want to <strong>help </strong>these women participate in this worthwhile exchange by giving them financial support. No work will be for sale at this exhibition. <strong>DONATE TODAY TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN! </strong>Your name will be added to our <a href=""http://wcainternationalcaucus.weebly.com/half-the-sky-2014shenyang-china.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wall of Gratitude</a> and you will receive our other perks to thank your for your assistance.</p>
<p>Sixteen women will be chosen to participate in this dedicated delegation. We have to <strong>GET THEM TO CHINA</strong>! <em>(As well as all the art!</em>)  The costs are challenging but completely doable with you help.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/932501/pictures/full/20130716105211-LuXun_Entrance.jpg?1373997134"" src="""" style="""" title=""LuXun Academy of Fine Arts""/></p>
<h3><strong>WHO ARE THESE WOMEN?</strong></h3>
<p>Artists will be juried by Alma Ruiz, Senior Curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. Essayists will be selected by Terri Weissman, Ph.D, Assistant Professor/Art History: Modern and Contemporary Art and History of Photography, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. <em>(Find out more about them below)</em>. Sixteen WCA members will make up the working delegation that will travel to Shenyang for the interactive components of this project.</p>
<p>This project includes a joint exhibition for Chinese women artists curated by Beijing –based artist and curator Yin Ou Zhao and self-identified women artists juried through WCA. The catalog will include selected essays around the topic of contemporary art practices.</p>
<p>Both of these aspects of the project - the cultural exchange and the exhibition - collectively form a piece of <strong>social practice art </strong><em>(okay, ready for that definition?)</em></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><strong><em>Definition:  Social Practice Art</em></strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Social practice art encompasses a wide range of art forms - public art,</em><em>interactive media, performance, dialogue, activism, community practice, community building, interventions, and collaborations that cross art, public and social arenas. It is participatory, creates social networks, and brings attention to social issues through interactive components.</em> </p>
<h3><strong>WHAT TYPE OF ART WILL BE EXHIBITED?</strong></h3>
<p></p>
<p><strong><em>New Media</em></strong></p>
<p>Innovative work that uses technology, such as digital imaging, animation, video art, sound art, video games, some of which will printed at the Academy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Installation</em></strong></p>
<p>Small and large environments, and light and sound-based work</p>
<p><strong><em>Social Practice Art Documentation</em></strong></p>
<p>Since most of this art is action-based, interactive and short-lived, it is often well-documented through photos, video and writing. Artists will be able to submit this documentation for consideration in this exhibition and as stimulus for discussion between our delegation and the Chinese artists.</p>
<p><strong><em>Traditional Art</em></strong></p>
<p>Includes painting, drawing, photography, sculpture, ceramics, fiber, collage,</p>
<p><strong>And all of this needs your help in getting to China!</strong></p>

<h3><strong>WHY SHOULD YOU FUND US? WHERE WOULD THE MONEY GO?</strong></h3>
<p><em>In its constitution, UNESCO - United Nations Educational, Scientific</em><em>and Cultural Organization - states that ""<strong>art</strong> plays an important part in education and that artists, by their works, may <strong>influence the conception of the world</strong> held by all people, and particularly by youth""... Art also ""reflects, preserves and enriches the cultural identity and spiritual heritage of the various societies, constitutes a universal form of expression and communication and, <strong>as a common denominator in ethnic, cultural or religious differences</strong>, brings home to everyone the sense of belonging to the human community.""</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>$36,000</strong> Wow! Yes! Huge bucks!</li>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>$24,000</strong> Yes! Still a huge number!</li>
</ul>
<p>Travel costs for US artists in delegation- We will have 15 working delegates traveling from the US to Shenyang, China and back.

We are WCA – Women’s Caucus for Art, a 41-year old arts & activism volunteer-run not-for-profit organization, which has also been an NGO of the United Nations since 1975. We have 1200+ members nationwide. The President of LuXun Academy of Fine Arts in Shenyang, China invited our International Caucus group to create an art-based cultural exchange with Chinese women artists. This exciting project will take place at the Academy in April 2014! Eighteen of us are actively developing this exchange and exhibition. We need your help to succeed.
The project is titled Half the Sky: Intersections in Social Practice Art
(wondering what Social Practice Art is??? - you are not alone – keep reading!)
We really need your help!  

to subsidize travel for the delegation of WCA members who will


share our lives through our universal artist perspectives

explore contemporary art practice in different cultures

build community with Chinese women artists in Shenyang

encourage mutual understanding in ways that transcend language barriers

to purchase technology to support the events developed by our American delegation
to create the catalog that will include the art works and essays from US art historians and writers

Women artists and writers throughout history have received little or no acknowledgement or compensation, and have had to shoulder many of their own costs.
We want to help these women participate in this worthwhile exchange by giving them financial support. No work will be for sale at this exhibition. DONATE TODAY TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN! Your name will be added to our Wall of Gratitude and you will receive our other perks to thank your for your assistance.
Sixteen women will be chosen to participate in this dedicated delegation. We have to GET THEM TO CHINA! (As well as all the art!)  The costs are challenging but completely doable with you help.

WHO ARE THESE WOMEN?
Artists will be juried by Alma Ruiz, Senior Curator at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. Essayists will be selected by Terri Weissman, Ph.D, Assistant Professor/Art History: Modern and Contemporary Art and History of Photography, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. (Find out more about them below). Sixteen WCA members will make up the working delegation that will travel to Shenyang for the interactive components of this project.
This project includes a joint exhibition for Chinese women artists curated by Beijing –based artist and curator Yin Ou Zhao and self-identified women artists juried through WCA. The catalog will include selected essays around the topic of contemporary art practices.
Both of these aspects of the project - the cultural exchange and the exhibition - collectively form a piece of social practice art (okay, ready for that definition?)


Definition:  Social Practice Art
Social practice art encompasses a wide range of art forms - public art,interactive media, performance, dialogue, activism, community practice, community building, interventions, and collaborations that cross art, public and social arenas. It is participatory, creates social networks, and brings attention to social issues through interactive components. 
WHAT TYPE OF ART WILL BE EXHIBITED?

New Media
Innovative work that uses technology, such as digital imaging, animation, video art, sound art, video games, some of which will printed at the Academy.
Installation
Small and large environments, and light and sound-based work
Social Practice Art Documentation
Since most of this art is action-based, interactive and short-lived, it is often well-documented through photos, video and writing. Artists will be able to submit this documentation for consideration in this exhibition and as stimulus for discussion between our delegation and the Chinese artists.
Traditional Art
Includes painting, drawing, photography, sculpture, ceramics, fiber, collage,
And all of this needs your help in getting to China!

WHY SHOULD YOU FUND US? WHERE WOULD THE MONEY GO?
In its constitution, UNESCO - United Nations Educational, Scientificand Cultural Organization - states that ""art plays an important part in education and that artists, by their works, may influence the conception of the world held by all people, and particularly by youth""... Art also ""reflects, preserves and enriches the cultural identity and spiritual heritage of the various societies, constitutes a universal form of expression and communication and, as a common denominator in ethnic, cultural or religious differences, brings home to everyone the sense of belonging to the human community.""

Hard to believe we're launching our 9th season. Incredible. It's been an amazing year: we dedicated ourselves to building infrastructure: hiring 2 staff members, increasing our annual budget by $20,000 and paying more of our artists. And the impact has been HUGE! Not only is the organization running a lot more smoothly but our events are more powerful and more packed than ever. (Funny how that works...)This coming season, we've got even more fantastic stuff coming up: we're going to begin making podcasts of our live events so that folks all over the world can get in on the fun. (Right?) We're holding our first evening service for the winter solstice in NYC. And, fingers crossed, we'll be having our first gathering of The Secret City Brooklyn! On top of all that, we'll be presenting more performance, visual art, food, live music, games, community interaction, storytelling and all of the other juicy stuff that folks have come to expect from our events.WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO? This campaign accounts for $20% of our annual budget. But how does that break down, exactly? We'll tell you.
