<p>Natif de la ville de Longvic en Bourgogne, ma destinée est
dans un parcours plein de richesse culturelle dans divers milieux sociaux avec
une orientation professionnelle plutôt technique et scientifique.</p>
<p>Le présent projet est né de la volonté de <strong>produire</strong> et de
<strong>crée de la valeur</strong> autour de moi dans une dynamique d'évolution sociétale basée
non pas sur la notion de consommateur mais de conso-producteur. C'est ainsi
qu'après l’amélioration de mes compétences personnelles et professionnelles, en
tant qu'ingénieur chef de projet au sein de centre de R&amp;D (Recherche et
Développement) chez divers constructeurs de moyen de transports routiers, j'ai
décidé de créer une société fin 2014 (MEDINE Technology) pour en faire l'outil
d'innovation et de développement d'une gamme de produits combinant <strong>utilité
sanitaire</strong> et <strong>confort thermique</strong>.</p>
<p>Tout projet est, en fait, une action et pour que l'action
produise ""bien et utile"" elle doit être précédée par le savoir. C'est
ce savoir que je cherche à financer pour 
garantir aux futurs usagers un produit efficace à la hauteur de
l'investissement qu'il vaudra.</p>

<p>Sachez qu’une mauvaise qualité de l’air entame notre

</div></div>","Following the trend of Marijuana legalization around the globe, Jamaica also plans to “free up” itself. This seems great, however the cards are still stacked against the traditional farmers who stand to lose out on what they have fought for with their blood sweat and tears as big multi-national corporations have high hopes of cashing in on this “Green Gold” rush.    We are a Nonprofit Organization set up to ensure a place in the regulated cannabis industry for Grassroots People and Rastafari.
 WHGFA’s objectives are to make sure that those who have paid the price – who have been going to jail, going to prison, getting the baton licks, who have been planting the herb only to get it cut down by police and soldiers, and yet have been persistent with this product – that the rights of these individuals are protected. 
Although the concept is simple, we still need some basic infrastructure to make this happen.

We believe that traditional farmers should have the opportunity to step out of years of stigmatization and have the opportunity to grow ganja legally.

</div></div>","Why Aquaponics?

100% USDA organic, non-GMO, and highly nutritious


One acre of indoor aquaponic farming produces the same amount of produce as twenty acres of conventional farming

Global arable land is decreasing at a staggering rate globally

Conventional agriculture uses 70% of freshwater on Earth; unsustainable

Aquaponics uses 90% less water than conventional agriculture 

365-day a year growing season


Higher yields


Shorter growing cycles


Fresh fish (high source of protein and Omega 3’s)

Viable in dense urban centers and resource scarce economies
Farming for the 21st century


What is Aquaponics?A closed-loop system of aquaculture in which the waste produced by farmed fish or other aquatic animals supplies all the essential nutrients for plants grown hydroponically, which in turn purify the water





Why one for one?

49 million Americans don’t know where their next meal is coming from


16 million are children and 5 million senior citizens… need we say any more?

Americans should NEVER have to choose between paying the electric bill or putting food on the table

Why open source?

It has been unnecessarily DIFFICULT and EXPENSIVE for us to find accurate information in the aquaponics/hydroponics space with regards to construction and operation of a farm


We don’t believe anyone should have to go down this route… EVER AGAIN






Why local?

Less food miles (less spoilage, lower transportation costs and smaller carbon footprint)


Freshness and nutrition is maintained within produce... AKA tastes WAYYY better


Closer relationship with our customers and community



Why shipping containers?

Cheap and ubiquitous


Incredibly efficient to heat/cool


Modular, already insulated, extremely sturdy (designed for load capacity of 80,000 lbs), and large enough to grow inside of


Easily transported and easy to retrofit

Repurposing of materials that would otherwise be tossed in landfill


Why LED lights?
Energy efficient (low operational costs)
Low heat output
Covers the full spectrum of lighting required of plants for optimal growth




How productive is Renaissance Farms?

40,000 lbs of microgreens annually (indoors)... Arugula, watercress, basil, mustard, beets, amaranth, etc.


4,000 lbs of fruiting crops and leafy greens annually (sunlit greenhouses)... Tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, lettuce, kale, chard, etc.


30,000 lbs of fresh Tilapia annually (indoors)







How does Renaissance Farms sell its produce?

Consumers subscribe to our Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) model via monthly fee (think Netflix, but for fresh produce)


RF distributes produce via same day delivery service


CSA provides local farmer with upfront insurance against any calamity during growing season while providing consumers with the freshest, local, organic produce possible


IMPORTANT: If you are interested in signing up for a CSA subscription, please contact us at info@RenaissanceFarmsLLC.com


The rest of our offerings will be sold via farmers markets, onsite farm-to-fork dining, and other vertically integrated distribution outlets



Does Renaissance Farms make money?
Yes, built from ground up to be 100% economically viable

Incredible efficiency in controlled environment agriculture + advancements in growing tech results in elimination of variables (allows us to control risk/reduce chance of crop failure)

By selling directly to the consumer, the farmer collects 100% of the profit (please see artistic diagrams below for further explanation)

Conventional Food Supply Chain


Renaissance Farms CSA Food Supply Chain









What do we need the money for?
12 insulated shipping containers
Fish tanks
Grow racks
Growing supplies
LED Lights
Environmental control equipment
Sunlit greenhouses
Solar panels and windmills
Rainwater storage tanks
Construction and engineering costs





Why renewable energy?
The world has a choice: we can either live in the 19th century or the 21st century; we choose the latter (duh!)

Will we face challenges?
Yes, of course! … As did every other entrepreneur who ventured out into the great unknown with the goal of changing the world

We are confident in our ability to adapt and overcome any challenges that stand in our way (bring it on!
""The best of the gold is at the bottom of the barrels of crap."" - Randy Pausch (Although in this case, fish tanks filled with fish poop!)

What prizes are available?
$100, $1000, $5000 or $10000 -  Donate 4 lbs, 40 lbs, 200 lbs or 400 lbs of Produce: We will donate our Renaissance Farms aquaponic microgreens to the Capital Area Food Bank of Austin, TX. These highly nutritious, USDA organic (did we mention super tasty??) microgreens will be harvested and delivered same day to the Food Bank, where they will be available for immediate pickup and consumption!







$200 - Grand Opening Celebration: You will receive one Golden Ticket to the grand opening night celebration of Renaissance Farms. The evening festivities will be fully catered, including food prepared with RF produce by local celebrity chefs, drinks supplied by local craft breweries, and live music performed by the finest local Austin musicians and late night DJ's. Trust us... This will be one party you won't want to miss.






$200 - Name in RF Branding Artwork: The cornerstone of the Renaissance Farms campaign... We will custom design our badass product packaging artwork to include your name. As Renaissance Farms expands and battles hunger across the United States, you will be right there with us and your name will stay on every product we sell – forever. This stylish artwork will be applied to produce packaging, cold-pressed juice bottles, CSA boxes, and any other future products we sell. 















$100 - Engraved RF Brick: We will engrave your name on a brick that will help form the pavilion area of Renaissance Farms. This area will serve as the cultural epicenter of our farm, a gathering area for social events, educational workshops, and outdoor dining. Each brick will serve as a timeless reminder to all visitors that this project would not have been feasible without your help. We will send you a one-of-a-kind certificate documenting your contribution to fighting world hunger as a token of our gratitude.

When you wear this shirt, everyone will know your thumb is green and your style is fresh! Yeah, it'll change your life... all the more reason to buy two!

<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What's Going On?</b><br/>
</h3></div>The villages of Court Gada and Rombhila are home to some of the most economically and socially marginalized peoples in Odisha, one of the most deprived regions of India. Without any access to water or sanitation, they have been condemned to a life of depravity and neglect. What’s worse, with historic droughts threatening the livelihoods of their subsistence farming lifestyle that had already kept them below the poverty line, the prospects for change are nearly non-existent.<div>
<br/><div>
<div>However, Asepsis, with the help of our amazing grassroots partner organization ASHA (Association for Sanitation and Health Activities), are working to change that. Enlisting members of the community to build 231 toilets for 231 families, while providing life-saving training and awareness program, Asepsis and ASHA will ensure that no child in Court Gada or Rombhila miss school because of an easily preventable waterborne illness; that no women or girls are sexually assaulted in search of a place to go to the bathroom; and that no child dies because we did not do anything to help.<br/>

<h3><b>Why Us?</b></h3>
<p>Because we’re doing it differently. In both the way we chose our partners and carry out awareness campaign we put people first, aiming to do what's best for the community and how to best address the issue. </p>
<h4>
<i style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;"">Partnership Structure</i><br/>
</h4>
<p>We believe that in many places the issue is not that a product is not available to help the community, but moreover that the distribution and community awareness portion is lacking. We search for organizations that understand the importance of taking a community-led sanitation approach and aim to increase their capacity, helping to build the toilets while they work on the unbelievably important community awareness aspect of the project. </p>
<h4><i>Awareness</i></h4>
<p></p>
<p>We realize that the issue of the sanitation crisis cannot be solved simply with the construction of toilets. We need to change the way we think about and interact with it. What we need is for the story of this social injustice to be told. We cannot keep it in the shadows any longer. For change to happen, we must start #ComingClean! </p>

<p>Over the next two months, during our crowdfunding effort, we are searching for photographers from around the country -- students, professionals, or freelancers -- to submit their best work highlighting a social injustice to have the opportunity of a lifetime through the Asepsis #ComingClean Challenge. The winner of the competition -- as decided by <a href=""http://www.asepsis.org/#judges"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our award-winning panel of judges</a> -- will have the opportunity for an all-expenses paid trip to Odisha, India with the members of the Asepsis team to document the work that we are doing in India and tell the story of the sanitation crisis through photography, helping to bring this hidden epidemic to light.</p>

<h3><b><br/></b></h3>
<h3><b>The Project</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>From November 19th to December 31st, we are raising funds to construct <b>231 toilets for 231 families in Odisha, India</b>. The large scale of this project will help make two villages free of open defecation. Working with our on-the-ground partner, <a href=""http://ashaworld.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ASHA (Association for Sanitation and Health Activities)</a><span>, we will cooperate with the community to improve sanitation through comprehensive and inclusive training programs that ensure long-term success.</span>
</p>
<p></p>
<div>ASHA has a great reputation with local leaders, government officials, and families in the area they work; most of their staff coming from Odisha. They ensure the path to improved sanitation does not stop with the construction of a toilet, but additionally work to promote open dialogue on the health and socioeconomic benefits of these toilets. ASHA also hires local residents of the communities to build the toilets themselves and pay them a good wage by local standards. All of this is the reason that ASHA has become known as a well-respected and extremely effective organization in the promotion of sanitation throughout the area, reducing the dependency of villages on the government and helping them promote their own sanitation solutions. <p></p>
</div>
<div>Once the funds are raised and the toilets are constructed, Asepsis will be traveling to these villages to meet with members of the community and ensure that the changes we are making are lasting and for the better.<br/>

<p>$200 will be going directly towards building the toilets. This will cover the material costs of the toilet and labor. It takes each ""toilet team"" about 1 week to create a finished toilet for a family.</p>
<p>$50 will be going towards verification, monitoring and evaluation of the project via the #ComingClean Challenge.  Our photojournalist winner of the Challenge will be coming to document the work we are doing in the community and delving into the crisis, aiming to best understand the intricacies of the area and making sure that we are indeed making the best possible impact in the community. Toilets are only the first step. From a development standpoint, while community programs ensure short- term adoption we need to make sure that this will in fact have a long lasting impact.  Every project that Asepsis carries out will have a visual-heavy monitoring and evaluation component in order to create the greatest amount of transparency for our supporters. </p>

<h3><b>More Information About the Community</b></h3>
<p>The two villages we will be working in are Court Gada and Rombhabila. They both come under RajSunakhala Panchayat of Ranapur block in Nayagarh District and are surrounded by small mountains 17 K.M away from Nayagarh District town, Odisha.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p>There are currently more than 470 households with a total population of 2600 in Court Gada and Rombhabila village, out of which 1100 in Court Gada and 1500 in Rombhabila. The majority of the people in Court Gada and Rombhabila villages belong to Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) and are economically marginalized. These were formerly known as “untouchables.”</p>

</div></div>","What's Going On?
The villages of Court Gada and Rombhila are home to some of the most economically and socially marginalized peoples in Odisha, one of the most deprived regions of India. Without any access to water or sanitation, they have been condemned to a life of depravity and neglect. What’s worse, with historic droughts threatening the livelihoods of their subsistence farming lifestyle that had already kept them below the poverty line, the prospects for change are nearly non-existent.

However, Asepsis, with the help of our amazing grassroots partner organization ASHA (Association for Sanitation and Health Activities), are working to change that. Enlisting members of the community to build 231 toilets for 231 families, while providing life-saving training and awareness program, Asepsis and ASHA will ensure that no child in Court Gada or Rombhila miss school because of an easily preventable waterborne illness; that no women or girls are sexually assaulted in search of a place to go to the bathroom; and that no child dies because we did not do anything to help.

Please join us!



What YOU can do:

Join our fundraising campaign. Rally your friends and family to help provide 231 toilets for 231 families in Odisha, India. It's only $250 to give a family safe, dignified access to sanitation 
Join our sister photography campaign: the #ComingClean Challenge. The winner will be coming with us to help re-define the sanitation crisis and uncover it as the social injustice we know it to be. 


Who are we?
Asepsis is a non-profit collaborative redefining the way we look at the sanitation crisis and the way that we solve it. Incorporating fundraising initiatives and awareness campaigns into community-based implementation projects around the world, we utilize a multi-faceted approach to address some of the most pressing issues in sanitation. We are starting a new dialogue on a historically neglected issue through the mediums of photography, journalism, and digital media to inform and activate people from all walks of life towards a common mission.









Why Us?
Because we’re doing it differently. In both the way we chose our partners and carry out awareness campaign we put people first, aiming to do what's best for the community and how to best address the issue. 

Partnership Structure

We believe that in many places the issue is not that a product is not available to help the community, but moreover that the distribution and community awareness portion is lacking. We search for organizations that understand the importance of taking a community-led sanitation approach and aim to increase their capacity, helping to build the toilets while they work on the unbelievably important community awareness aspect of the project. 
Awareness

We realize that the issue of the sanitation crisis cannot be solved simply with the construction of toilets. We need to change the way we think about and interact with it. What we need is for the story of this social injustice to be told. We cannot keep it in the shadows any longer. For change to happen, we must start #ComingClean! 


Over the next two months, during our crowdfunding effort, we are searching for photographers from around the country -- students, professionals, or freelancers -- to submit their best work highlighting a social injustice to have the opportunity of a lifetime through the Asepsis #ComingClean Challenge. The winner of the competition -- as decided by our award-winning panel of judges -- will have the opportunity for an all-expenses paid trip to Odisha, India with the members of the Asepsis team to document the work that we are doing in India and tell the story of the sanitation crisis through photography, helping to bring this hidden epidemic to light.
For more information on how to get involved with the #ComingClean Challenge, visit our website at: http://www.asepsis.org/


The Project

From November 19th to December 31st, we are raising funds to construct 231 toilets for 231 families in Odisha, India. The large scale of this project will help make two villages free of open defecation. Working with our on-the-ground partner, ASHA (Association for Sanitation and Health Activities), we will cooperate with the community to improve sanitation through comprehensive and inclusive training programs that ensure long-term success.


ASHA has a great reputation with local leaders, government officials, and families in the area they work; most of their staff coming from Odisha. They ensure the path to improved sanitation does not stop with the construction of a toilet, but additionally work to promote open dialogue on the health and socioeconomic benefits of these toilets. ASHA also hires local residents of the communities to build the toilets themselves and pay them a good wage by local standards. All of this is the reason that ASHA has become known as a well-respected and extremely effective organization in the promotion of sanitation throughout the area, reducing the dependency of villages on the government and helping them promote their own sanitation solutions. 

Once the funds are raised and the toilets are constructed, Asepsis will be traveling to these villages to meet with members of the community and ensure that the changes we are making are lasting and for the better.

Break-down of the $250 

$200 will be going directly towards building the toilets. This will cover the material costs of the toilet and labor. It takes each ""toilet team"" about 1 week to create a finished toilet for a family.
$50 will be going towards verification, monitoring and evaluation of the project via the #ComingClean Challenge.  Our photojournalist winner of the Challenge will be coming to document the work we are doing in the community and delving into the crisis, aiming to best understand the intricacies of the area and making sure that we are indeed making the best possible impact in the community. Toilets are only the first step. From a development standpoint, while community programs ensure short- term adoption we need to make sure that this will in fact have a long lasting impact.  Every project that Asepsis carries out will have a visual-heavy monitoring and evaluation component in order to create the greatest amount of transparency for our supporters. 

More Information About the Community
The two villages we will be working in are Court Gada and Rombhabila. They both come under RajSunakhala Panchayat of Ranapur block in Nayagarh District and are surrounded by small mountains 17 K.M away from Nayagarh District town, Odisha.




There are currently more than 470 households with a total population of 2600 in Court Gada and Rombhabila village, out of which 1100 in Court Gada and 1500 in Rombhabila. The majority of the people in Court Gada and Rombhabila villages belong to Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) and are economically marginalized. These were formerly known as “untouchables.”
The baseline survey carried out by “ASHA” and “DWSM” revealed that out of 183 households 181 households have no access to toilets, hence, 99% of the population of Court Gada defecates in the open. In Rombhabila village, more than 78% of the population has no access to toilets.




The Project (Continued)
This project will work towards the creation of two open defecation-free environments in Court Gada and Rombhabila, dramatically reducing the amount of diseases associated with sanitation problems. 
The Toilet Team
ASHA pays its workers -- residents of the local community -- about $10 per day. This is above the local average and is justified by the training and workshops they provide for their workers. This training covers the technical aspects of construction and maintenance, along with the health benefits provided by the toilets, solidifying an understanding of the link between sanitation and health. These teams of workers are called the “Toilet Team.”
Maintenance 
Maintenance of each toilet will be the responsibility of the concerned beneficiary; however, ASHA will request assistance from the local health department of Sunakhala and their health expert Dr. Sanjaya Mohanty to carry out inspections. ASHA will also provide follow-up checks, advice and expertise

<p>Setting up any kind of business in a different country is a big challenge. Many of the remaining costs, big and small, came unexpectedly, popping up out of the blue to present us with yet another major challenge, next to the intercultural web itself. Indonesia's business practices are often different, rules and grey zones sometimes tantalizing. Problems such as ownership, vague foreign investment policy and so on, make us very alert on how challenging it tends to get, therefore encouraging us to be as creative and open as possible with our approaches toward  local business partners. With your financial help, issues like working permits, foreign investment protection, and in general business security, can be dealt with, allowing us to get back on track and make Tales of Coffee happen in the very near future .. </p>
<p><b>A long way to Crowdfunding </b></p>
<p>It’s never easy to have to ask for financial help but we are doing our very best to be as transparent as possible about every phase of our brand's operation process. Reaching out to the wider community also means we get the chance to raise besides money also awareness on our brand, our goals, and to enhance and guide people through the rich culture, craftmanship, and people behind one of the most renomated coffee beans in the world. We hope to be able to do this, not just through media, but in real life as well - by Organizing coffee tours in coöperation with the farmers and guides on the spot. We sincerely hope to have your ( financial and moral ) support to set up this Coffee Project and that you will Spread the Tale &amp; Join our Journey through Indie Gogo, our website, facebook, instagram or  Pinterest. </p>

<p></p>

<p><i>( 2 ) Creating more awareness among the local farmers and domestic population on the great potential their Natural Resources harbor in them. </i></p>

<p><i>(<b> 1 ) Our First Trademark: Fine &amp; Exclusive Indonesian Arabica. No Middleman. The Whole Story, freshly roasted. </b></i></p>
<p><i>We didn't went deliberately for the smaller exclusive farms, it's just that the best coffee tends to be limited in supply because often more vulnerable for diseases and other external threats, and harder to reach, in general. setting sail to Islands and regions where we already knew of they had some World Class coffees, upon arrival e always went one step further by checking with the local coffee communities and experts ( with sometimes a very advanced coffee scene ) which one of the great coffees is the greatest.

<p><i>We ought to boost initiatives and knowledge surrounding Indonesian Specialty Coffee by several distinct ways; </i></p>

<p><i>* We ought to work with local people from outside the coffee business as well, indirectly sensitizing them about the richness of their own natural resources. </i></p>
<p><b><i>( 3 ) Farmer Culture &amp; Indonesian Roots </i></b></p>
<p><i>Our thirth Mission is a clear one. We want to tell the Tale behind the coffee.

<p><i>While keeping the cultural values and those beautiful Tales of Coffee as intact as possible, we invest in the farms to compliment old and authentic techniques of bean selection, bean processing, packaging et cetera, adding  several newer approaches to these processes, which in the long run will result in bigger capacity and more financial means for the farmers and their villages.

</div></div>","Hi There! First of all, thanks a lot for checking our Campaign. If you are into a fresh cup of specialty coffee with a story, and do like the idea of helping significantly in setting up this small Coffee Brand, you are at the right place indeed! Our story is simple. We started our quest to Magic beans five months ago, in the Archipel of Indonesian Islands. Islandhopping ourselves to a selection of the great coffee regions, we visited Coffee farms, skipping the middleman and getting great cultural insights in both domestic and Coffeefarmer specific Culture. Today, 5 Months after we hopped on the first ferry towards our first beans, we may proudly state we have a team of three very devoted Caffeinated freaks that, with the very limited budget we have, has the following progress accomplished; • We set up a valueable network of coffee farmers, local experts, shop owners and B2B clients. 
• We have selected, negociated and ordered a collection of 4  truly distinct specialty coffees good for 1250 kg green beans of what we believe to be Indonesia's finest Arabica Coffee, ready to be roasted.  
• We have 10 buying partners and taste ambassadors, whom are in line with our inherent values. 
• We have our own website up running, guiding people through the whole story, processes, methods and journey. From farmer to cup.       
• We designed and ordered our packaging, 2500 Exclusive Paper Tubes, which took us nearly 6 months to design. Arrival planned by Mid August. Prototype samples already produced.                    Our Journey                





We went Far & beyond. What We still need: 
We made the bean selection, we have our first buyers, we got the coffee here safely, and we have our online platforms up and running - all of this on our own -with the exception of the artworks which were done by a young graphic design student with whom we established a close cooperation. We have spent every dime we could spend, saving money on everything we could do ourselves, and yet it has not been enough. There’s much left to be done and we can only go on with your help. We  With that extra dollar, euro, sterling, rupiah, even Old Obol coins, whatever have you, anything is more than welcome to back us up through these last highly important costs of our dear coffee project, namely; 
• The legal business setup in Indonesia ( 7690 Usd ) 
• The roasting costs of our first batch of 1250 kg of coffee ( 3445 Usd ) 
• Alternative Packages for alternative markets, 2500 krafpaper bags with valve ( 330 Usd ) 
•The Sealing Stickers and Package information stickers ( 115 Usd )

We didn't went deliberately for the smaller exclusive farms, it's just that the best coffee tends to be limited in supply because often more vulnerable for diseases and other external threats, and harder to reach, in general. setting sail to Islands and regions where we already knew of they had some World Class coffees, upon arrival e always went one step further by checking with the local coffee communities and experts ( with sometimes a very advanced coffee scene ) which one of the great coffees is the greatest.

With nearly 71 % of the good quality coffee - cultivated locally - leaving the country yearly, the locals often are not aware nor given the opportunity to enjoy the full potential of their Arabica coffee beans. 
We ought to boost initiatives and knowledge surrounding Indonesian Specialty Coffee by several distinct ways; 
* We organize Coffeetours on two of the Islands to let both domestic and visiting audience experience first hand where coffee originates from, which strong cultural traditions are still surrounding the cultivation and what kind of diversity the Indonesian Coffee Scene really has to offer. 
* We ought to work with local people from outside the coffee business as well, indirectly sensitizing them about the richness of their own natural resources. 
( 3 ) Farmer Culture & Indonesian Roots 
Our thirth Mission is a clear one. We want to tell the Tale behind the coffee.

What We Do


The Gateway Center works to end homelessness, and particularly chronic homelessness, by providing a supportive and compassionate setting where individuals can receive the tools, therapeutic programs, and services they need to end their homelessness and achieve self-sufficiency.


1. Equip - GWC strives to equip each individual who walks through our doors with tools to restore dignity and end their homelessness. Our first floor operates 24/7 and provides for individuals' most fundamental needs. Services include public showers, restrooms, laundry machines, hygiene kits, phones, a clothing closet, locker storage, and much more. Some people like to say that they 'don't believe in hand outs, but give hand-ups instead'. . . Which is great, but we also agree with Martin Luther King Jr. when he asked how one could expect a person ""to pull themselves up by their bootstraps, when they don't have any boots?"" 


2. Empower - Gateway Center has 8 residential programs on-site for men working to end their homelessness. Because there is no one-size-fits-all solution to homelessness, each of our programs addresses a different area that may be contributing to a person's homelessness. We have individualized programs for veterans, addiction recovery, mental health, employment training ... Etc.

3. Engage - Gateway connects clients with partner organizations both on-site and in the larger community for long term success.

wines from grapes grown in the Pacific Northwest regions of Oregon and
Washington. Sourcing fruit from quality, sustainably managed vineyards farming
to the highest environmental standards. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt; font-family: Times; color: #1F1F1F;"">Edward William and Monique Marie
Lefferts, a husband and wife team relocated from Scottsdale Arizona to Portland
Oregon with a dream of one day operating a small winery, employing themselves
together, and working side by side to achieve a dream in William Marie Wines.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt; font-family: Times; color: #1F1F1F;"">With backgrounds in hospitality, and Ed a Certified Sommelier, both
Ed and Mo have gained a true passion for food and wine, and strive to craft the
highest quality wine the Pacific Northwest vineyards have to offer. Our
campaign to achieve this dream follows years of hard work and effort, which began
with our inaugural vintage in 2014, with a Washington syrah sourced from a
single vineyard in the Walla Walla Valley. That syrah has been resting in
barrel for 5 months, and flavors from initial tastings are all pointing to an
exceptional wine, one that they couldn’t be more proud of as first time
winemakers. However, to continue in 2015, they need financial assistance to
fully realize this dream. The groundwork has been laid by having already
solidified contracts both to source the 2015 fruit, and handcraft the wine in a
custom crush facility in the heart of Oregon's Willamette Valley. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt; font-family: Times; color: #1F1F1F;"">Funding this campaign, has more
importance than simply making this years harvest into the best juice possible.
It helps the two in an instrumental step toward entering the professional
winemaking world, with a long-term goal of employing each other together,
building a career from a passion, and the continued opportunity to build
further relationships in the wine community to grow and sustain. </span><span style=""color: rgb(31, 31, 31); font-family: Times; font-size: 21px;""> </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 16.0pt; font-family: Times; color: #1F1F1F;"">Contributions for this campaign will
help fund a magnitude of needs to get William Marie Wines off the ground. With
two very key contacts already in place, the need for license's and permits to
operate, and distribute wine is the starting point. These necessary
applications for permits are both with the Oregon Liquor Control Commission and
the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. Your contribution will then
assist in funding the costs associated with winemaking from acquisition of
grapes, to the crush, barrel purchase and aging, and eventually bottling,
corking, and labeling the final product.</span></p>

<h3><br/></h3>
</div></div>","William Marie Wines strives to become a boutique wine label, crafting
wines from grapes grown in the Pacific Northwest regions of Oregon and
Washington. Sourcing fruit from quality, sustainably managed vineyards farming
to the highest environmental standards. 
Edward William and Monique Marie
Lefferts, a husband and wife team relocated from Scottsdale Arizona to Portland
Oregon with a dream of one day operating a small winery, employing themselves
together, and working side by side to achieve a dream in William Marie Wines.
With backgrounds in hospitality, and Ed a Certified Sommelier, both
Ed and Mo have gained a true passion for food and wine, and strive to craft the
highest quality wine the Pacific Northwest vineyards have to offer. Our
campaign to achieve this dream follows years of hard work and effort, which began
with our inaugural vintage in 2014, with a Washington syrah sourced from a
single vineyard in the Walla Walla Valley. That syrah has been resting in
barrel for 5 months, and flavors from initial tastings are all pointing to an
exceptional wine, one that they couldn’t be more proud of as first time
winemakers. However, to continue in 2015, they need financial assistance to
fully realize this dream. The groundwork has been laid by having already
solidified contracts both to source the 2015 fruit, and handcraft the wine in a
custom crush facility in the heart of Oregon's Willamette Valley. 
Funding this campaign, has more
importance than simply making this years harvest into the best juice possible.
It helps the two in an instrumental step toward entering the professional
winemaking world, with a long-term goal of employing each other together,
building a career from a passion, and the continued opportunity to build
further relationships in the wine community to grow and sustain.  
Contributions for this campaign will
help fund a magnitude of needs to get William Marie Wines off the ground. With
two very key contacts already in place, the need for license's and permits to
operate, and distribute wine is the starting point. These necessary
applications for permits are both with the Oregon Liquor Control Commission and
the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau. Your contribution will then
assist in funding the costs associated with winemaking from acquisition of
grapes, to the crush, barrel purchase and aging, and eventually bottling,
corking, and labeling the final product.
Your contribution to William Marie
Wines will help fund the following expenses: 
Licensing and Permits: $1,000
2 tons of fruit: $3,200/ton = $6,400
Custom Crush Facility rate: $1,800
/ton = $3,600
More barrels, Bottles, Labels, Corks,
Fermenter: $3,000
Total: $14,000
So, they ask that you join them on
the journey of taking William Marie Wines from a concept to a reality, by
helping create these exceptional boutique wines. They plan to keep contributors
fully informed throughout the winemaking process.  Through direct and social media postings you will have an
opportunity to follow in the journey of crafting wines from the grapes you’ve
helped them acquire and process.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/><h3>About Challah for Hunger</h3>
<div>Eli Winkelman started Challah for Hunger as a student at Scripps College in 2004. She missed baking challah with her family, and was looking for a connection to the Jewish community at her school. To solve this, Eli began baking challah with friends, and quickly realized she and her friends could use challah-baking to mobilize and educate others. They began selling the challah and donating the profits to social justice causes. Word of Eli’s project spread, and soon Eli was guiding students, from all corners of the globe, as they started their own Challah for Hunger chapters.<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span><br/></span>A decade after Eli’s first challah sale, Challah for Hunger continues to thrive. Currently, thousands of volunteers on 78 campuses across the US, Canada, Australia, and England gather on a regular basis to continue the centuries-old tradition of baking challah together</span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">in an inclusive environment. For all the volunteers and many of the customers, Challah for Hunger provides opportunities to be involved in a fun and dedicated community, address humanitarian problems, develop and practice new skills, and gain business and leadership experience.</span></p>

Looking for the perfect gift this holiday season? Give your friends and family a Challah for Hunger long sleeve t-shirt! Available in S, M, L and XL. Will ship by December 4th*. 
*We will email you for the name and address of the recipient.Summary
Challah for Hunger brings people together to bake and sell challah to raise funds and awareness for social justice causes. We are a chapter model, currently working with 78 chapters on college campuses. Our goal is to expand our network to 100 active
chapters by the end of the 2016-2017 school year. The more chapters we have today, the more leaders we train for tomorrow. 100 active chapters = 3,500+ social
change leaders = $150,000 to fight hunger globally and locally. 
We need to raise $30,000 to significantly expand our core operations to support this growth.  When you give to Challah for Hunger, you double your impact: (1) you invest in the future leaders of our community and (2) support local and global efforts to end hunger.
The ProjectChallah for Hunger is a model for young people to meet, explore their mutual responsibility to heal the world through activism and philanthropy, and engage in community and Jewish tradition. Volunteers at 78 chapters around the world, mostly on college, campuses bake and sell challah and donate their earnings to non-profits working to end hunger around the world.During the #ChallahDays we need to raise $30,000 to significantly expand our headquarters to support our volunteers and expand our network to 100 chapters.In the past three years, we’ve increased the number of chapters we support and individuals we reach by 37.5%. In 2013, we supported 56 chapters. Today, we have 78 active chapters. At the start of the 2012-2013 school year, we reached 1,200 regular volunteers. In 2014-2015 we’ve reached 3,000 regular volunteers and those volunteers engaged 36,713 people through their work on campus and in their communities.In order to support chapter growth, we’ve nearly doubled our budget over the past two years. In 2013, our budget was $199,056 and our 2015 budget is $361,304. Over the next two years, we expect to grow our budget to $475,000 to meet program needs. We need your help to grow our budget!We need your help to better assist our students and reach 100 active chapters by the end of the 2016-2017 school year.$30,000 will support the growth of our chapter program to 100 active chapters by the end of the 2016-2017 school year. This funding will allow us to:
Provide additional staff support - we can visit more chapters and dedicate more time to mentoring student leaders
Create and distribute more resources, like advocacy tool kits, recipes, and start up training materials
Facilitate more training opportunities, like our annual leadership summits which bring together more than 125 students from chapters for 2 days of leadership development trainings

About Challah for Hunger
Eli Winkelman started Challah for Hunger as a student at Scripps College in 2004. She missed baking challah with her family, and was looking for a connection to the Jewish community at her school. To solve this, Eli began baking challah with friends, and quickly realized she and her friends could use challah-baking to mobilize and educate others. They began selling the challah and donating the profits to social justice causes. Word of Eli’s project spread, and soon Eli was guiding students, from all corners of the globe, as they started their own Challah for Hunger chapters.A decade after Eli’s first challah sale, Challah for Hunger continues to thrive. Currently, thousands of volunteers on 78 campuses across the US, Canada, Australia, and England gather on a regular basis to continue the centuries-old tradition of baking challah together in an inclusive environment. For all the volunteers and many of the customers, Challah for Hunger provides opportunities to be involved in a fun and dedicated community, address humanitarian problems, develop and practice new skills, and gain business and leadership experience.

Raised $800,000+ for hunger relief and social justice causes

</li> <li>We're also hoping to have a bit of money set aside to help with advertising. Particularly in schools, to help kids learn about our existence. We believe that getting kids interested in writing and art is a great thing, and actually intend on having a program for kids in specific, eventually!<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>We feel that our creative lounge will help many people in different ways.</p>
<p>Not everyone has space to create in, whether because they live in a small place, or have a loud family, or whatever may have you. We feel like these people could benefit most from having a dedicated place that hey can be creative, without all of the troubles that come from not having your own space.</p>
<p>On top of having creative space however, we also want to have a distraction-free area for people. When you're at home and trying to write, focus, work, on anything, there's so much around... Video games, TV, Netflix, the family dog wanting to play RIGHT NOW, your parents asking what on earth you're doing now... Here, it's just you and the computer, or canvas. We will encourage gathering together with a group to discus things, but if you're on your own, we won't pester you!</p>
<p>Above all, we want to be able to help people who may not be able to get noticed, BE noticed. With a community of writers and artists, you often find people who want to also support their fellow artists and writers. This is where the gallery comes in handy, on-site, all of the creations made by our members, ready to be bought by other members.</p>
<p>All of this can only be possible if we have somewhere to begin, by way of opening up shop, with the help of the community at large...<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Admittedly, this is our first time running a business, of any sort, on a professional level. Jen was a regular Thomasina Sawyer as a kid, running many a lemonade stand and neighborhood car wash, but that's nothing quite like this. So we realize we'll be learning as we do. This isn't always an awful thing though. Since we're something new, we're willing to make changes as our members need or want them.</p>
<p>For example, maybe no one enjoys a certain art, we'll put less attention in that direction, and focus more on something that we never even thought of introducing.

To begin with we're looking for $5,000, which we can get doubled thanks to a local grant!
Things we're going to need the funding for:
 Our space! We have a location chosen, but if we can't occupy it, then we're no good to anyone! We're also going to need to make the area ready for you guys! A room is great, but a room with chairs and tables is a bit more comfortable!

 We're also hoping to have a bit of money set aside to help with advertising. Particularly in schools, to help kids learn about our existence. We believe that getting kids interested in writing and art is a great thing, and actually intend on having a program for kids in specific, eventually!
    The Impact We feel that our creative lounge will help many people in different ways.
Not everyone has space to create in, whether because they live in a small place, or have a loud family, or whatever may have you.

<p>The US Census bureau measured Bend’s growth from 2013 to 2014 at 2.7%. This rapid growth further weighs down a pre-existing affordable housing deficit. Teachers, small business owners, nurses, restaurant servers, maintenance workers, grocers, and public servants are consistently priced out of homes within city limits. These people contribute to our city’s thriving economy and provide necessary services, yet Bend’s current economy excludes them from buying homes and having stability. The
median household income in Bend Oregon is approximately $50,000.  The median home cost is $325,000, and the
average home cost is over $500,000.  The
median home cost requires an income of approximately $77,000.  This is 154% of the median income!<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Without any options on the horizon over half of the people in our town cannot afford to own or buy a home in this market, let alone a safe, healthy, sustainable home. For a population of over 80,000, there were only 51 homes for sale in August which were affordable to those making median income or less. Many of those 51 homes were in various stages of disrepair and would need work done in order to bring them up to today's safety standards. What is the cultural loss if we continue to overlook solutions to the housing crisis?

</div></div>","OUR STORY
The US Census bureau measured Bend’s growth from 2013 to 2014 at 2.7%. This rapid growth further weighs down a pre-existing affordable housing deficit. Teachers, small business owners, nurses, restaurant servers, maintenance workers, grocers, and public servants are consistently priced out of homes within city limits. These people contribute to our city’s thriving economy and provide necessary services, yet Bend’s current economy excludes them from buying homes and having stability. The
median household income in Bend Oregon is approximately $50,000.  The median home cost is $325,000, and the
average home cost is over $500,000.  The
median home cost requires an income of approximately $77,000.  This is 154% of the median income! Without any options on the horizon over half of the people in our town cannot afford to own or buy a home in this market, let alone a safe, healthy, sustainable home. For a population of over 80,000, there were only 51 homes for sale in August which were affordable to those making median income or less. Many of those 51 homes were in various stages of disrepair and would need work done in order to bring them up to today's safety standards. What is the cultural loss if we continue to overlook solutions to the housing crisis? Who will teach your children?  Who will answer the phone when you need dispatch? Who will bag your groceries? Who will serve your latte'?

<h3>Our dream</h3>
</div>
<div>We are looking to start production of houses and also work with disaster relief programs all over the world, we know our houses will help those in need to live a better life after a disaster. We want our house to solve their temporary and permanent housing problems.<br/><br/>We also want to expand locally to every state , eventually globally and help create employment for new areas in the globe with our low cost housing. With a few trained professionals our houses can be built easily and quickly for the world's housing needs.<br/><br/><h3>Benefits of using our houses</h3>Our design and materials used makes the house 100% recyclable with no shortcuts taken, As such the QT home is a fire retardant, lightning safe home. Your family or loved ones  would be living in a structurally sound and safe home. The entire construction is so strong that the QT home could be lifted with a crane and relocated with no damage sustained.<br/><br/>There is also the benefit of customizing the QT home.<br/>What we have shown is only the base model, this model can be full customized to suit the needs of the people living in it or the requirements of the business.<br/>The house is fully extendable both length wise and width making for a infinite possibilities of uses for the QT homes.<br/>This will allow for larger homes, workshops , clinics just to name a few.
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h3>What would happen if we exceed our target goal?</h3>If we exceeded our target goals, we would be setting up additional factories around the country and globally. We really as a family and company want to help all those who have been affected in natural and man made disasters around the world. We believe that these QT homes are a quick semi and permanent solution to much of the worlds housing problems.<br/><br/>We would also be looking to creating custom solar panels and batteries for the QT home to help alleviate the world's energy problems, by helping to remove people's reliance on non-renewable energy. This would be especially predominate if and when we get our houses to disaster relief locations.</div><div><br/></div><div>

<div>
<h3>What extra features can be made for the QT home?</h3>
The QT home can be fully customized to your preference, Wooden sun decks can be made to suit the exterior. The internal paneling can be changed to wood or metal panels. We will provide the basic house to your specifications and then your house is yours to customize, You can make your home yours.

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">How can you help?</span><br/>
</h3>
</div>
<div>We are a small family business and we are looking for funding to start a production factory. We have many people interested in the houses however we are lacking the funds to produce the houses on a large scale. We are looking for a fund boost to really step-up our production.<br/><br/>So fund our idea and we can help make the world a better place to live in.
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>We have been working on this design and project for many years now so we have ironed out most of the wrinkles and problems, However there is always room for improvements and innovation and we would always appreciate feedback. To pledge to this project you will be helping us realize an idea and a design which shall help the world.</div>
<div>Manufacturing - As with any manufacturing we need new tools as we move onto a larger scale production, This would help us move forward into a faster time scale on production, but would also require some time to setup.<br/><br/>Ease of Transport - Since this project was designed with a flat pack idea in mind the transport of this QT home is a non issue. All that is needed is a truck to transport the materials and the house is as good as delivered. No need for abnormal trucks or any other awkward transportation method. </div>
<div>Product adjustments - Custom product adjustments will always slow down the process but to create the best product for the customer has always been our aim.</div>
<div>What happens if we don't reach our goal? - That won't stop us, it will only slow down our production. We still aim to continue the project as we have invested too much time and money to give up a dream.<br/>
</div>

Your family or loved ones  would be living in a structurally sound and safe home. The entire construction is so strong that the QT home could be lifted with a crane and relocated with no damage sustained.There is also the benefit of customizing the QT home.What we have shown is only the base model, this model can be full customized to suit the needs of the people living in it or the requirements of the business.The house is fully extendable both length wise and width making for a infinite possibilities of uses for the QT homes.This will allow for larger homes, workshops , clinics just to name a few.



What would happen if we exceed our target goal?If we exceeded our target goals, we would be setting up additional factories around the country and globally. We really as a family and company want to help all those who have been affected in natural and man made disasters around the world. We believe that these QT homes are a quick semi and permanent solution to much of the worlds housing problems.We would also be looking to creating custom solar panels and batteries for the QT home to help alleviate the world's energy problems, by helping to remove people's reliance on non-renewable energy. This would be especially predominate if and when we get our houses to disaster relief locations.





What extra features can be made for the QT home?
The QT home can be fully customized to your preference, Wooden sun decks can be made to suit the exterior. The internal paneling can be changed to wood or metal panels. We will provide the basic house to your specifications and then your house is yours to customize, You can make your home yours.




How can you help?


We are a small family business and we are looking for funding to start a production factory. We have many people interested in the houses however we are lacking the funds to produce the houses on a large scale. We are looking for a fund boost to really step-up our production.So fund our idea and we can help make the world a better place to live in.



Risks and challengesWe have been working on this design and project for many years now so we have ironed out most of the wrinkles and problems, However there is always room for improvements and innovation and we would always appreciate feedback. To pledge to this project you will be helping us realize an idea and a design which shall help the world.
Manufacturing - As with any manufacturing we need new tools as we move onto a larger scale production, This would help us move forward into a faster time scale on production, but would also require some time to setup.Ease of Transport - Since this project was designed with a flat pack idea in mind the transport of this QT home is a non issue. All that is needed is a truck to transport the materials and the house is as good as delivered. No need for abnormal trucks or any other awkward transportation method. 
Product adjustments - Custom product adjustments will always slow down the process but to create the best product for the customer has always been our aim.
What happens if we don't reach our goal? - That won't stop us, it will only slow down our production. We still aim to continue the project as we have invested too much time and money to give up a dream.



How can you help us without funding?

Spread the word. We need to expose this QT home to the world and we would like everyone to know. We believe it's a fantastic concept and we want to share it with everyone, and only you can help us. Share our page with your friends, family , your bosses, and your co-workers. Spread the word on social medias, use the Indiegogo share tool to tell everyone. Help us spread our cheap home for everyone. Twitter: https://twitter.com/QT_Homes

<p></p>
<p>An Automatic External Defibrillator is an extremely small and light electronic device that is extremely portable and has been designed to analyze and monitor the heart rhythm of a person who is in cardiac arrest and send a shock through their chest wall to their heart whenever needed in order to shock their heart back into rhythm. An Automatic External Defibrillator is made of a battery, some electronic circuitry and adhesive electrode pads that are placed on the patient’s chest. AEDs look much like small briefcases and are one of the safest yet most effective ways of dealing with cardiac arrest. </p>

In many cases, saving the life of a sudden cardiac arrest victim is  a simple as utilizing an Automated External Defibrillators (AED).  In a heart emergency every second counts.  AED's are critical in the fight to save lives.   Thats why your donation with go to help purchase AED's for as many schools, community centers and places of worship as possible.

An Automatic External Defibrillator is an extremely small and light electronic device that is extremely portable and has been designed to analyze and monitor the heart rhythm of a person who is in cardiac arrest and send a shock through their chest wall to their heart whenever needed in order to shock their heart back into rhythm. An Automatic External Defibrillator is made of a battery, some electronic circuitry and adhesive electrode pads that are placed on the patient’s chest. AEDs look much like small briefcases and are one of the safest yet most effective ways of dealing with cardiac arrest.",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Over the past months the Kids &amp; Petfinder team has
spent a considerable amount of time analyzing pets and children..</p>
<p>At the same time we have done extensive
research and pioneer work in the field of energy-efficient technology for
“GPS-tracking”. Thanks to this we have managed to successfully make the base
for the development of a fully functional, ultra-light and highly accurate
precision high-tech GPS system.</p>
<p>The collar will be fully engineered and
designed in Dubai and Germany.</p>
<p>The Kids &amp; Petfinder GPS system is extremely small
and slim  and will be super light,
weighing just over 60g.</p>
<p>In addition to extensive battery life, a small
weight is the biggest challenge in manufacturing a GPS system. From the
beginning it is our ambitious goal to develop a collar that weighs less than 60
grams. Any collar weighing more than 90 grams is not suitable  to wear comfortably and you should stay away from it, no matter how tempting it
may be.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453324676/hgtbrvyrtployvdgazhm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p><i><u><b>BATTERY LIFETIME 4 WEEKS</b></u></i></p>
<p>The energy supply of a GPS system is a
seemingly irresolvable problem. Long operational periods result in high energy
usage. Therefore, a big battery is needed which inevitably leads to a heavy and
bulky GPS collar. Thanks to our team and expert partner we have found an
energy-efficient technology for micro GPS-tracking solution to this problem.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453300236/vujsidvhmfzvt4vv9hve.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><u><b>SAFETY</b></u></i><br/></p>
<p>Of course, the safety of your child or pet is
paramount and the Kids &amp; Petfinder GPS collar will come with a safety release
which opens instantly should your child or pet ever get caught somewhere. We use
commercially available and proven safety releases since we do not want to risk
your child's or pet’s health.</p>
<p><i><u><b>APP &amp; WEBSITE</b></u></i></p>
<p>You can easily configure and manage the Kids &amp; Petfinder GPS through our web-portal. Your child or pet is tagged on
the digital map to allow you to follow the movements at any time. Set safety
and danger zones around your house, adjust the alert messaging service, manage
account access rights of family members or check the current battery charge
among many other things. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453300573/fuso1nr4qcf3bsysnwkp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><u><b>DIGITAL MAP</b></u></i><br/></p>
<p>Easily monitor your child or pets’ whereabouts via
Google Maps from any place at any time. The covered distance is traced
constantly and can be accessed and analyzed at any chosen time. This allows you
to gather a variety of statistical data about your child or pet. The child or pets walking area
or his/her favorite hiding places are just a couple of examples. Have you ever
wondered how many meters or even kilometers your cat/dog covers in a day, a
month or a year or how fast he is when he’s or she is on the move? How large is
your cat’s/dogs territory? Or are you curious if your cat/dog occasionally gets
snacks at your neighbor’s house? Where is the schoolbus of my child? Is my child on the playground? </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453324711/kgpa5evpjr9zxgyeepxf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>Our future dedicated smartphone application is
free and available for Apple and Android. It offers easy access to the most
important features of the GPS collar. All the features of the Kids &amp; Petfinder GPS
collar are also available via web-browser and on any computer with internet
access.</p>
<p><i><u><b>WHAT COMES WITH THE SYSTEM</b></u></i></p>
<p>In order to track your child or pet you will need a:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Kids &amp; Petfinder GPS collar</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Kids &amp; Petfinder HomeStation (Receiver and

<p>·<span>  no </span>monthly service subscription</p><p>- you only pay for the device, App and tracking is free of charge</p><p><b><i>WHAT YOU ADDITIONALY NEED</i></b></p><p><b>You need to buy a domestic SIM Card with a monthly DATA Package. For the GPS Kids &amp; Petfinder you will need a data volume of max. 50 Megabyte per month. Usage 24/7. Depending on where you are located this would cost you monthly appx. $ 10 - $ 30. </b></p>
<p><i><u><b>HOW DOES IT WORK</b></u></i></p>
<p>The GPS signal is received by the Kids &amp;  Petfinder
GPS collar that your child or pet wears. The GPS coordinates are then transmitted to
the Kids &amp;  Petfinder Home Station (receiver). The coordinates are forwarded
through the internet connection to the Kids &amp; Petfinder server. The server is then
accessed via Smartphone, computer or tablet to locate your pet.</p>
<p>Tracks of your chld or pet are recorded constantly.
This ensures that you will find your cat even in areas without reception.</p><p><b><i>COMPANY &amp; MANAGEMENT</i></b></p>

The collar will be fully engineered and
designed in Dubai and Germany.
The Kids & Petfinder GPS system is extremely small
and slim  and will be super light,
weighing just over 60g.
In addition to extensive battery life, a small
weight is the biggest challenge in manufacturing a GPS system. From the
beginning it is our ambitious goal to develop a collar that weighs less than 60
grams. Any collar weighing more than 90 grams is not suitable  to wear comfortably and you should stay away from it, no matter how tempting it
may be.
BATTERY LIFETIME 4 WEEKS
The energy supply of a GPS system is a
seemingly irresolvable problem. Long operational periods result in high energy
usage. Therefore, a big battery is needed which inevitably leads to a heavy and
bulky GPS collar. Thanks to our team and expert partner we have found an
energy-efficient technology for micro GPS-tracking solution to this problem.SAFETY
Of course, the safety of your child or pet is
paramount and the Kids & Petfinder GPS collar will come with a safety release
which opens instantly should your child or pet ever get caught somewhere. We use
commercially available and proven safety releases since we do not want to risk
your child's or pet’s health.
APP & WEBSITE
You can easily configure and manage the Kids & Petfinder GPS through our web-portal. Your child or pet is tagged on
the digital map to allow you to follow the movements at any time. Set safety
and danger zones around your house, adjust the alert messaging service, manage
account access rights of family members or check the current battery charge
among many other things. DIGITAL MAP
Easily monitor your child or pets’ whereabouts via
Google Maps from any place at any time. The covered distance is traced
constantly and can be accessed and analyzed at any chosen time. This allows you
to gather a variety of statistical data about your child or pet. The child or pets walking area
or his/her favorite hiding places are just a couple of examples. Have you ever
wondered how many meters or even kilometers your cat/dog covers in a day, a
month or a year or how fast he is when he’s or she is on the move? How large is
your cat’s/dogs territory? Or are you curious if your cat/dog occasionally gets
snacks at your neighbor’s house? Where is the schoolbus of my child? Is my child on the playground? 
Our future dedicated smartphone application is
free and available for Apple and Android. It offers easy access to the most
important features of the GPS collar. All the features of the Kids & Petfinder GPS
collar are also available via web-browser and on any computer with internet
access.
WHAT COMES WITH THE SYSTEM
In order to track your child or pet you will need a:
· 
Kids & Petfinder GPS collar
· 
Kids & Petfinder HomeStation (Receiver and
Charger)
· 
computer with internet connection (for initial
setup)
· 
wireless router (WLAN or WiFi)
· 
computer, smartphone or tablet with internet
connection for tracking
·  no monthly service subscription- you only pay for the device, App and tracking is free of chargeWHAT YOU ADDITIONALY NEEDYou need to buy a domestic SIM Card with a monthly DATA Package. For the GPS Kids & Petfinder you will need a data volume of max. 50 Megabyte per month. Usage 24/7. Depending on where you are located this would cost you monthly appx. $ 10 - $ 30. 
HOW DOES IT WORK
The GPS signal is received by the Kids &  Petfinder
GPS collar that your child or pet wears. The GPS coordinates are then transmitted to
the Kids &  Petfinder Home Station (receiver). The coordinates are forwarded
through the internet connection to the Kids & Petfinder server. The server is then
accessed via Smartphone, computer or tablet to locate your pet.
Tracks of your chld or pet are recorded constantly.
This ensures that you will find your cat even in areas without reception.COMPANY & MANAGEMENT

<p>The East
Lansing market is full of male and female millennials looking for a unique and
fun workout or the next big trend in fitness, including almost 49,000 students
and additional 11,000 faculty. This business-type is unique to the area and appeals to millennials
(average age in East Lansing is 21.6 years). The concept is at a lower price point than existing individualized fitness studios, to appeal to college-aged students and a community with a median family household income of
approximately $80,000. There is a high concentration of fitness studios in the
area but no individual cycling studios in the market. The concept of an
individual fitness focused studio has been tested and proven repeatedly in this
area and others through individual fitness activities such as: yoga, Crossfit,
karate, dance, etc. The concept of a cycling dedicated studio has proven
successful in urban key markets such as, DC and New York, through recognized
brands: SoulCycle, FlyWheel and Ride. By bringing a similar concept down to a
lower price point, the same experience that is popular in these metropolitan
areas can be affordable for millennials in a large college community with
disposable income. The average cost of a similar (but not the same) fitness
class in the market currently is between 10 and 15 dollars. Not only does OneRide
look to compete on price; they are able to offer a unique experience with value
in going outside of a traditional membership model.</p>

OneRide we strive to create a culture around peloton (from the French word
platoon) bicycle riding; holding each other up to an upbeat, fast-paced, high
energy workout, riding as a pack. To fulfill our mission we strive to be a respected
member of the community we call home through engagement and charity.  Importance of Giving Back

OneRide
wants to give back and be a part of the community. At least five rides a month
will be charity dedicated rides with the proceeds donated to a local
charity. This is a key tenant of the OneRide vision. We are one community!   Market Opportunity

The East
Lansing market is full of male and female millennials looking for a unique and
fun workout or the next big trend in fitness, including almost 49,000 students
and additional 11,000 faculty. This business-type is unique to the area and appeals to millennials
(average age in East Lansing is 21.6 years). The concept is at a lower price point than existing individualized fitness studios, to appeal to college-aged students and a community with a median family household income of
approximately $80,000. There is a high concentration of fitness studios in the
area but no individual cycling studios in the market. The concept of an
individual fitness focused studio has been tested and proven repeatedly in this
area and others through individual fitness activities such as: yoga, Crossfit,
karate, dance, etc. The concept of a cycling dedicated studio has proven
successful in urban key markets such as, DC and New York, through recognized
brands: SoulCycle, FlyWheel and Ride. By bringing a similar concept down to a
lower price point, the same experience that is popular in these metropolitan
areas can be affordable for millennials in a large college community with
disposable income. The average cost of a similar (but not the same) fitness
class in the market currently is between 10 and 15 dollars. Not only does OneRide
look to compete on price; they are able to offer a unique experience with value
in going outside of a traditional membership model.

<h1>FROM LOCAL FOOD TRAILER TO FULL-FEATURE, FAMILY-FRIENDLY RESTAURANT: </h1>
<h1></h1>
<h4><b><i>AJs Wings is looking to spread its wings in Portales, New Mexico – help support our project and receive some great swag and perks!</i></b></h4>
<p><b>The world of food can be a very exciting one. People dine together while enjoying each other’s company. While experiencing different flavors and savoring traditional local dishes or exotic ones, we are able to relax, reconnect with others, and let go of the stresses of our day-to-day lives. A delicious meal can provide the perfect occasion for a family get-together or reuniting of friends. All in all, it can be a rewarding experience, one that we wish to re-live regularly…not to mention the fact that those cooking and serving great food have the pleasure of knowing their efforts are paying off with satisfied customers.</b></p>
<p><b>In Portales, New Mexico, the world of food is exciting, however it is somewhat limited in its choices. At AJ’s Wings, we understand the need for fun places to go out to relax, eat a great meal, and gather with family and friends. We truly believe that a new restaurant would be heartily and enthusiastically welcomed here in Portales. Presently, AJ’s operates a mobile food unit in and around town, serving the best chicken wings, strips, sauces and mozzarella sticks this side of the Rio Grande! We have a growing, loyal clientele who surely would love a permanent place to kick back, enjoy some wings and refreshment, and relax after a long day.</b></p>
<p><b>Presently, we operate only on weekends, but the response from the public has been extremely positive in the 2 ½ years AJ’s has been in business. Because of this successful experience, we would now like to build on that success by opening a full-feature, quick serve, family-friendly restaurant in Portales. </b></p>
<h3>As for our trailer, we would continue to serve our amazing customers from our mobile food unit, serving Cannon AFB as well as operating at several special events throughout the year.</h3>
<p><b>Our vision for AJ’s is to present a quick-service but high quality restaurant with a casual air. Our hope is for an indoor capacity of 50 people or more as well as offering additional seating with an outdoor patio or sidewalk café area where as many folks as possible can come to enjoy our fabulous food and visit with friends. Customers at AJ’s restaurant will be able to enjoy locally brewed beer on tap, TVs for watching sporting events, a comfortable atmosphere , extended hours, and the same friendly service you have come to expect from AJ‘s.</b></p>
<b>On the “business” side of things, AJ’s expansion will provide new job opportunities for local residents as well as stimulate the Portales and Roosevelt County economies to some extent. <b>As much as we possibly can, we will incorporate local foods and products, thereby assisting other local operations in the process.  As an employer, AJ's </b>philosophy is to offer our staff a living wage in addition to mutual trust and respect. We hope our employees will love coming to work because we will encourage work life balance and employee well being.  </b>
</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<b><br/></b><p><b>In order to accomplish this vision, we are seeking to raise at least $50,000 for the purpose of acquiring an existing downtown building, remodeling the dining and kitchen areas, leasing and installing kitchen equipment and providing suitable furnishings to create this special place that we want to provide to the residents of Portales.</b></p>

<br/>2.) Sharing this campaign with friends and family to maximize the potential of this campaign to support the creation of a fresh new dining environment in the little town of Portales, NM<br/>Thank you so much for your loyal support and for considering this vision with us.</h3>

<br/><h3>1.) Location, Location, Location:  </h3>
<p>We hope to take possession of a building that is in or near the downtown/square area.  If this is not possible, we prefer to be closer to the ENMU campus than farther away.  We also want to find a location with adequate parking and with optimal size to allow for an indoor seating capacity of around 50.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460430187/FrontRendering_rb32kv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>2.) Open Kitchen: </h3>
<p>As we envision being a quick-service restaurant, the kitchen will not be closed off from the dining area.  Our service counter will essentially be the only divide between the seating and cooking areas.  This will provide our customers with a unique atmosphere that involves everyone in the process of cooking their meals.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460430015/KitchenRendering_wrw2lv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>3.) Casual Quick Service:  </h3>
</div><div style=""text-align: center;"">With an open kitchen layout, the dining area will be immersed in the everyday traffic.  As people come and go, they will be able to stop and enjoy their meal at one of our tables or along the far counter.  TVs will provide entertainment, usually sporting events, and we hope to have cold beer available for those looking to unwind a little.<p></p>

<h3>4.) Outdoor Patio:  </h3>
<p>One thing that Portales does not offer is an outdoor eating option.  We would like to change this by building a patio where customers can choose to enjoy our awesome wings basking in the gorgeous High Plains sunshine or relaxing under the stars.  Our patio build would include a sound retaining wall to help reduce noise for the neighboring businesses, a fire pit to gather around during the evening, and a small stage for us to showcase local talent and live music.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>We have chosen our funding option to be what Indiegogo refers to as Flexible Funding.  This means that we will retain all funds that we receive from backers even if we do not hit our project goal of at least $50,000.  We decided to go this route as we feel that if we fall short of our goal for opening a store, we can still expand our operations by acquiring a larger/newer trailer that would better suite our customers and their growing hunger for great chicken wings.</b></p>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;"">With that being said, we have set the following goals for this project:</h4>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Raise $0:  </b>While we find this to be highly unlikely given the level of interest we have received from our customers, it is still a possibility.  If we raise no funds for this project we will continue to operate as we have for the past 2 1/2 years, serving lunch at Cannon AFB, slinging wings on the weekend in the Goobers parking lot, and attending various events throughout the year.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Raise $1 - $5K:  </b>This level of funding will allow us to make renovations to our current trailer including, but not limited to, new fryers, new sink and plumbing, upgraded cooling capacity and general maintenance.</p>

This would allow us to expand our menu offerings to include new sauces and menu items.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Raise $26k - $50K: </b> This is the minimum level of funds required to realistically consider going forward with a store.  Given the upfront cost and our desire to remain outside traditional funding as much as possible, we would need to reach this level of support to begin work on a permanent location.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Raise $51K and Up:</b>  Any amount above and beyond our funding goal of $50K will allow us to expedite projects such as our patio build</p>

<b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My name is Aaron Crandall, and I am the founder and sole owner of AJs Wings.  After being laid off in March of 2013 and having zero luck with employment opportunities, I turned to an idea with huge potential, but that would require an immense amount of work and </span>dedication.  Armed with a business degree and a 20lb electric fryer, AJs Wings was born!  After a single car show in Clovis, we teamed up with Goobers in Portales to sell chicken wings to their customers.</b> </div><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p><b>With hours of work put into a converted stock trailer, we began with just chicken wings and fries, all cooked from that single 20lb electric fryer.  Our capacity limit was about 12 wings at once.   Over time we have made several changes, including the addition of two 50lb propane fryers, which allowed us to step up to the increased demand.</b></p>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">As a father of 4 amazing children, who mean the world to me, AJs Wings has become my means of providing for them.  My team is comprised entirely of family members: My Dad, Gary; My Mom, Diane; My Brother, Joseph.  They have been a tremendous help in making sure AJs keeps up with our growing demand.</b></p>
<p><b>This project is immensely important to me because I want AJs Wings to give back to the community by creating jobs, bringing an exciting new venue to Portales and allowing others to benefit from the success that I have had!</b></p>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">The success we have had is in part due to our philosophy of staying small with a minimal menu, yet serving generous portions, providing great customer service, and, of course, thanks to our awesome customers!</b></p> </div> <div> <h3 style=""text-align: center;""></h3>

<h4>A family-friendly atmosphere suitable for all ages.  </h4>
<h4>
<br/>A new place for friends to gather with an <br/>outdoor patio/open air seating area.</h4>
<h4>
<br/>A focus on local economy:  <br/>We will use as many ingredients from local merchants as possible to ensure that our success is enabling the success of others in our community as well! </h4>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Our goal with this campaign is to raise as much of the required funding as possible.  However, starting any business (especially a restaurant) is not cheap, and every business venture comes with unforeseen obstacles.  With that in mind, we know there will be some challenges to overcome:</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>- Securing the building and location that best fits our vision:  In order to secure the building we will need either a long term lease, to borrow the funds to purchase, or purchase outright with funds from this campaign.  Our vision is very specific and we have a handful of locations in mind that would meet most of the requirements.</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>- Additional remodeling or electrical/plumbing requirements: We have crunched the numbers hundreds of times and we feel that we have accounted for just about anything that could go wrong during this process.  However, we will not know exactly what we are dealing with until we get started on revamping our space.  Issues could include delays due to weather, supply issues, unforeseen plumbing problems, required electrical updates, etc.  If you've ever done any type of remodel, you know that these types of challenges could potentially cause major headaches.</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>- Obtaining the proper licensing: As much as we would love to serve beer with our amazing wings, there will be several hoops to jump through regarding the proper licensing.  This will take some time and may delay our ability to serve.  However, we do not feel that this will take away from our vision and what we are striving to achieve.  We understand the in-depth process and reasoning for such regulations and will do our part to serve safely and responsibly.</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>- Overwhelming response:  While we certainly want to see as much support as possible, there is the chance we will simply be overwhelmed by the support we receive.  If we are lucky enough to face this challenge it could lead to delayed shipping and processing of perks to our backers.  During such an event, we will do our best to openly communicate with all of our supporters so that everyone will knows what to expect as we sort out the details.</b></p>

<div>
<br/><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><h4>Q: When Can I Expect My Perks?</h4>
<p>A: Great question!  As we plan on using the funds raised to open a store for an already successful business, most perks will be available within about 3 months of our receiving funds.  We plan on to distribute perks in 2 different groups.  Those perks that only have merchandise (shirts, hats, glasses) will be distributed in September 2016, about 3 months after we receive funding.  Lunch ticket perks will be available for distribution in October of 2016.  Any additional perks that include food vouchers, catering, or memberships will not be ready for distribution until January of 2017.  This will allow us to get opened and running smoothly before giving out free or discounted food.</p>
<h4>Q: Why Now?</h4>
<p>A:  Many of our customers continually ask us when we are getting a store.  Some even tell us we need to.  Our big picture vision has always included a store and we feel the timing is right to take the first step in that direction.</p>
<h4>Q: I Don't Live in Portales, or New Mexico, Why Should I Back Your Project?</h4>
<p>A: Obviously if you don't live in or around Portales, you won't directly benefit from the impact our project will have.  However, ask yourself if you love any of the following:  Chicken wings, great food, beer, cool swag, locally owned businesses, main street, growing the economy?  If you answered yes to any of the above, then check out our backing options that don't include food related perks.  All backing levels include shipping inside the US.</p>
<h4>Q: Where Can My Food Vouchers, VIP or Club Membership Perks Be Used?</h4>
<p>A: All food related perks, including food vouchers, VIP discounts and club memberships, will only be redeemable at our new store.  In the event we do not obtain the required funding for opening the store front, we will honor these perks at our trailer beginning in January 2017.</p>
<h4>Q: What About Investment Opportunities?</h4>
<p>A: If you're interested in investing or partnering with AJs WIngs for any future endeavors, please contact us at AJsWings@live.com.  We will gladly consider any opportunity.</p>

FROM LOCAL FOOD TRAILER TO FULL-FEATURE, FAMILY-FRIENDLY RESTAURANT: 

AJs Wings is looking to spread its wings in Portales, New Mexico – help support our project and receive some great swag and perks!
The world of food can be a very exciting one. People dine together while enjoying each other’s company. While experiencing different flavors and savoring traditional local dishes or exotic ones, we are able to relax, reconnect with others, and let go of the stresses of our day-to-day lives. A delicious meal can provide the perfect occasion for a family get-together or reuniting of friends. All in all, it can be a rewarding experience, one that we wish to re-live regularly…not to mention the fact that those cooking and serving great food have the pleasure of knowing their efforts are paying off with satisfied customers.
In Portales, New Mexico, the world of food is exciting, however it is somewhat limited in its choices. At AJ’s Wings, we understand the need for fun places to go out to relax, eat a great meal, and gather with family and friends. We truly believe that a new restaurant would be heartily and enthusiastically welcomed here in Portales. Presently, AJ’s operates a mobile food unit in and around town, serving the best chicken wings, strips, sauces and mozzarella sticks this side of the Rio Grande! We have a growing, loyal clientele who surely would love a permanent place to kick back, enjoy some wings and refreshment, and relax after a long day.
Presently, we operate only on weekends, but the response from the public has been extremely positive in the 2 ½ years AJ’s has been in business. Because of this successful experience, we would now like to build on that success by opening a full-feature, quick serve, family-friendly restaurant in Portales. 
As for our trailer, we would continue to serve our amazing customers from our mobile food unit, serving Cannon AFB as well as operating at several special events throughout the year.
Our vision for AJ’s is to present a quick-service but high quality restaurant with a casual air. Our hope is for an indoor capacity of 50 people or more as well as offering additional seating with an outdoor patio or sidewalk café area where as many folks as possible can come to enjoy our fabulous food and visit with friends. Customers at AJ’s restaurant will be able to enjoy locally brewed beer on tap, TVs for watching sporting events, a comfortable atmosphere , extended hours, and the same friendly service you have come to expect from AJ‘s.
On the “business” side of things, AJ’s expansion will provide new job opportunities for local residents as well as stimulate the Portales and Roosevelt County economies to some extent. As much as we possibly can, we will incorporate local foods and products, thereby assisting other local operations in the process.  As an employer, AJ's philosophy is to offer our staff a living wage in addition to mutual trust and respect. We hope our employees will love coming to work because we will encourage work life balance and employee well being.  

In order to accomplish this vision, we are seeking to raise at least $50,000 for the purpose of acquiring an existing downtown building, remodeling the dining and kitchen areas, leasing and installing kitchen equipment and providing suitable furnishings to create this special place that we want to provide to the residents of Portales.


1.) Taking a look at the fabulous perks we are offering in exchange for your support of our project. You will be helping to grow a simple but popular mobile food unit into a restaurant reality in Portales, New Mexico!

AND

2.) Sharing this campaign with friends and family to maximize the potential of this campaign to support the creation of a fresh new dining environment in the little town of Portales, NMThank you so much for your loyal support and for considering this vision with us.
We hope to soon be serving you and your friends at our new location in downtown Portales.







We have a very specific vision for our building, and while we have a handful of locations in mind, we will take the time to acquire the building that will bring us as close to that vision as possible.
1.) Location, Location, Location:  
We hope to take possession of a building that is in or near the downtown/square area.  If this is not possible, we prefer to be closer to the ENMU campus than farther away.  We also want to find a location with adequate parking and with optimal size to allow for an indoor seating capacity of around 50.


2.) Open Kitchen: 
As we envision being a quick-service restaurant, the kitchen will not be closed off from the dining area.  Our service counter will essentially be the only divide between the seating and cooking areas.  This will provide our customers with a unique atmosphere that involves everyone in the process of cooking their meals.


3.) Casual Quick Service:  
With an open kitchen layout, the dining area will be immersed in the everyday traffic.  As people come and go, they will be able to stop and enjoy their meal at one of our tables or along the far counter.  TVs will provide entertainment, usually sporting events, and we hope to have cold beer available for those looking to unwind a little.

4.) Outdoor Patio:  
One thing that Portales does not offer is an outdoor eating option.  We would like to change this by building a patio where customers can choose to enjoy our awesome wings basking in the gorgeous High Plains sunshine or relaxing under the stars.  Our patio build would include a sound retaining wall to help reduce noise for the neighboring businesses, a fire pit to gather around during the evening, and a small stage for us to showcase local talent and live music.






We have chosen our funding option to be what Indiegogo refers to as Flexible Funding.  This means that we will retain all funds that we receive from backers even if we do not hit our project goal of at least $50,000.  We decided to go this route as we feel that if we fall short of our goal for opening a store, we can still expand our operations by acquiring a larger/newer trailer that would better suite our customers and their growing hunger for great chicken wings.
With that being said, we have set the following goals for this project:
Raise $0:  While we find this to be highly unlikely given the level of interest we have received from our customers, it is still a possibility.  If we raise no funds for this project we will continue to operate as we have for the past 2 1/2 years, serving lunch at Cannon AFB, slinging wings on the weekend in the Goobers parking lot, and attending various events throughout the year.
Raise $1 - $5K:  This level of funding will allow us to make renovations to our current trailer including, but not limited to, new fryers, new sink and plumbing, upgraded cooling capacity and general maintenance.






Raise $6K - $25K: This level of funding will allow us to look into acquiring a newer trailer with a larger capacity that will better suite our needs. This would allow us to expand our menu offerings to include new sauces and menu items.
Raise $26k - $50K:  This is the minimum level of funds required to realistically consider going forward with a store.  Given the upfront cost and our desire to remain outside traditional funding as much as possible, we would need to reach this level of support to begin work on a permanent location.
Raise $51K and Up:  Any amount above and beyond our funding goal of $50K will allow us to expedite projects such as our patio build



If our project sounds like the kind of restaurant that you
would like to visit and where you would like to enjoy great food with friends
and family then we invite
you to take a look at the great perks that we have on offer our backers in return for helping us turn our vision into reality!



My name is Aaron Crandall, and I am the founder and sole owner of AJs Wings.  After being laid off in March of 2013 and having zero luck with employment opportunities, I turned to an idea with huge potential, but that would require an immense amount of work and dedication.  Armed with a business degree and a 20lb electric fryer, AJs Wings was born!  After a single car show in Clovis, we teamed up with Goobers in Portales to sell chicken wings to their customers. 
With hours of work put into a converted stock trailer, we began with just chicken wings and fries, all cooked from that single 20lb electric fryer.  Our capacity limit was about 12 wings at once.   Over time we have made several changes, including the addition of two 50lb propane fryers, which allowed us to step up to the increased demand.
As a father of 4 amazing children, who mean the world to me, AJs Wings has become my means of providing for them.  My team is comprised entirely of family members: My Dad, Gary; My Mom, Diane; My Brother, Joseph.  They have been a tremendous help in making sure AJs keeps up with our growing demand.
This project is immensely important to me because I want AJs Wings to give back to the community by creating jobs, bringing an exciting new venue to Portales and allowing others to benefit from the success that I have had!
The success we have had is in part due to our philosophy of staying small with a minimal menu, yet serving generous portions, providing great customer service, and, of course, thanks to our awesome customers!   

We feel that the institutions that provide traditional funding tend to concern themselves too much with their own bottom line.  Instead of helping a major bank increase its profits we prefer to keep our customers involved in our growth opportunity by providing great perks in return for financial backing.  By doing this we will be able to keep our prices low while maintaining a livable wage and work-life balance for our employees, and giving back to our community. 

We know we can't do this without the help of our loyal customers and the support of our local community.  And we certainly would not ask for your backing without offering something in return.  For your generous contribution we have a variety of perks available ranging from free food and event catering, to t-shirts, hats and even naming your own sauce!


   







This project will not only allow us to open a store in Portales, but will also provide the following benefits to our community:
A family-friendly atmosphere suitable for all ages.  

A new place for friends to gather with an outdoor patio/open air seating area.

A focus on local economy:  We will use as many ingredients from local merchants as possible to ensure that our success is enabling the success of others in our community as well! 

These items will include, when available, produce, fresh tortillas, and craft beers.

All branded merchandise will be acquired from local merchants.  Your backing will not only support our project, but will also support several different merchants in the Portales/Clovis area.  This is only one of the ways we are encouraging growth in our community.

Another way we will help stimulate the economy is by providing between 4-10 paid positions, to be filled by local residents.  We will provide a livable wage for all positions we create, which hopefully will elevate our employees' standard of living, and in turn, generate economic growth.


Help us build a permanent location where we can continue to provide you with the  great food and excellent service that you've come to love!






   

Our goal with this campaign is to raise as much of the required funding as possible.  However, starting any business (especially a restaurant) is not cheap, and every business venture comes with unforeseen obstacles.  With that in mind, we know there will be some challenges to overcome:
- Securing the building and location that best fits our vision:  In order to secure the building we will need either a long term lease, to borrow the funds to purchase, or purchase outright with funds from this campaign.  Our vision is very specific and we have a handful of locations in mind that would meet most of the requirements.
- Additional remodeling or electrical/plumbing requirements: We have crunched the numbers hundreds of times and we feel that we have accounted for just about anything that could go wrong during this process.  However, we will not know exactly what we are dealing with until we get started on revamping our space.  Issues could include delays due to weather, supply issues, unforeseen plumbing problems, required electrical updates, etc.  If you've ever done any type of remodel, you know that these types of challenges could potentially cause major headaches.
- Obtaining the proper licensing: As much as we would love to serve beer with our amazing wings, there will be several hoops to jump through regarding the proper licensing.  This will take some time and may delay our ability to serve.  However, we do not feel that this will take away from our vision and what we are striving to achieve.  We understand the in-depth process and reasoning for such regulations and will do our part to serve safely and responsibly.
- Overwhelming response:  While we certainly want to see as much support as possible, there is the chance we will simply be overwhelmed by the support we receive.  If we are lucky enough to face this challenge it could lead to delayed shipping and processing of perks to our backers.  During such an event, we will do our best to openly communicate with all of our supporters so that everyone will knows what to expect as we sort out the details.


Share, share, share!

 We understand that not everyone is able to contribute financially.  Regardless of your contribution level, we ask that you please share this campaign with your friends and social media followers to give us the best opportunity to meet our goal and begin work on what will prove to be a special addition to the High Plains area!  Make some noise about AJs Wings and let your friends know how they can help as well!  We know we have the best customers in the world, and we have faith that you will do everything you can to help us bring our vision to life!  In the top left corner of this campaign you will find the share buttons so you can help spread the word!

<p>The revered and elusive Ecuadorian cacao variety known as
“Nacional” traces its genetic lineage back 5,300 years. As of seven<b> </b>years ago, it was
believed to be extinct. In the remote valley of Piedra de Plata we found nine
cacao trees that are 100% genetically pure Nacional—verified by DNA testing.
Each of these old-growth trees are at the end of their lifespan. When they die,
thousands of years of flavor evolution will die with them. We want to save this
ancient heirloom cacao variety from extinction by reproducing these trees through
grafting and seed propagation. We need your help to do this. In exchange, we
offer you our chocolate and cherished cacao from Piedra de Plata in various different forms:</p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465339395/Perks_Presentation_psbbbs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465411348/Button_Claim_yours_xmilgn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><br/></p><ul>

</p><p>Nacional’s genetic lineage goes back 5,300 years ago in
Ecuador, which is now recognized as the native origin of cacao. In recent
centuries, Nacional reached global fame for its trademark floral aroma and
complex flavor profile. Then in 1916 the variety was decimated by an outbreak
of Witches’ Broom disease throughout the country, and a century of
hybridization followed. By the beginning of the 21st century it was believed
that genetically pure Nacional no longer existed. <br/></p>

</ul><br/><p><b>What are the main varieties of cacao and why is Nacional so special?</b></p>DNA testing distinguishes between ten varieties of cacao: Marañon, Curaray, Criollo, Iquitos, Nanay, Contamana, Amelonado, Purús, Guiana, and Nacional, in addition to thirty-seven secondary cultivars.  Each variety has it's own signature flavor profile. It is estimated that 99.945% of cacao that is labeled ""Nacional"" is actually from trees that are hybrids--i.e., a blend of Nacional with several other genetic varieties (see below for details). Chocolate writer Mark Xian, in the C-Spot, describes the general Nacional flavor profile as: ""naturally sweet/low fat but raw cocoa bean-taste with heavy body (paradoxically light in the upper palate) gilded in florid violet, lilac, jasmine, orange blossom… a unique bouquet (combination herbal/forest green/ fresh meadow); reds &amp; blackberries, black mission figs (depending on region); occasional spices (especially cinnamon); lower bitterness though astringent tannins.""<br/><br/><p><b>How rare is Nacional, really?</b></p><p>To give you an idea of how rare this variety is, the Ecuadorian government genetically tested 11,000 different cacao trees throughout the entire country and only 6 of these trees proved to be pure Nacional. That means that only 0.055% of ""Nacional"" cacao in Ecuador is actually pure Nacional. In a limited sampling of 16 old-growth cacao trees that we tested in Piedra de Plata, 9 of them proved to be pure Nacional. So of the estimated 25 million cacao trees in Ecuador, only a meager 15 are known to be pure Nacional!  This project would increase the number of pure Nacional trees to over 1,000, which would reestablish a viable population of this historic cacao variety. This is our way of building a time machine. Through this effort, present and future generations will be able to experience an ancient treasure.  <br/></p><p><b>Is anyone else doing this? </b></p><p>As far as we know, this is the first-ever project of its kind. Previous efforts have been made to promote new plantings of hybridized Nacional, which is a far cry from the famous Nacional cacao of the nineteenth century, in terms of flavor profile and complexity. The reason nobody is planting pure Nacional is because they are notoriously finicky trees and are much less productive than hybrids. In the age of mass production, with the world’s appetite for chocolate ever on the rise, countries like Ecuador are replacing less productive heirloom cacao varieties like Nacional with high-yield hybrids that have less flavor. Pure Nacional cacao, along with its unique flavor profile, is on the doorstep of extinction. The last surviving pure Nacional trees are at the end of their lives. This project needs to be executed yesterday. </p><p><b>Why can’t you just plant seeds?</b></p><p>For
one, the pure Nacional cacao trees in Piedra de Plata are so old that their
cacao production is almost finished. Some of them now only produce two or three
pods per year. Also, the existing pure Nacional trees are in close proximity to
other cacao trees that are not genetically pure. Due to cross-pollination between these other trees, seeds from pure Nacional trees will include foreign genetic material. Grafting avoids this problem. Genetic material from the pure Nacional trees is directly grafted onto the young seedlings. The seeds eventually produced by these grafted seedlings will be genetically pure Nacional, provided sufficient distance allowed between them and all other hybrids. It’s the seeds (commonly referred to as ""beans"") that are used to make chocolate.  </p><p><b>How does grafting work?</b></p><p>Grafting can be done a few different ways. With cacao, a young branch is removed from the desired tree—in this case, from a pure Nacional tree. This branch (called the scion) is then attached to a young seedling (called the root stock). The scion is literally stuck into a cleft that has been cut into the root stock, and a special kind of tape is wrapped around the scion so that it remains attached. Slowly but surely, the wood of the two different trees fuse together, and the scion becomes a living part of the root stock. It’s actually an amazing process. Grafting can also be
utilized to reproduce grape vines, citrus trees, and all sorts of other fruit
trees.</p><p><b>Where will the new trees be planted?</b></p><p>The new trees will be planted in each of the farms of the fourteen cacao growers in Piedra de Plata with whom To’ak works, in addition to Harvest Master Servio Pachard's farm. New trees will also be planted in an experimental agroforestry plot in the nearby Jama-Coaque Reserve, managed by the rainforest conservation foundation Third Millennium Alliance. </p><p><b>How do the farmers benefit?</b></p><ul>
<li><p>We pay the cacao growers of Piedra de Plata the highest price per pound in the country. </p></li>
<li><p>We sponsor the Organic and Fair Trade certification process not only for their cacao, but for all of the other crops they produce on their farms, which increases the price they receive by 20%.  </p></li>
<li><p>We sponsor ongoing sustainable agroforestry workshops for all participating farmers<br/></p></li>
<li><p>The fourteen cacao growers of Piedra de Plata share 10% of To’ak’s profits. </p></li>
</ul><p><b>Is it Organic and Fair Trade?</b></p><p>Yes and yes. All cacao sourced by To’ak and all chocolate made by To’ak is certified Organic and Fair Trade. </p><p><b>Where do funds go if we don’t reach our entire goal?</b></p><p>Our goal is to graft and plant as many pure Nacional cacao trees as we can. For every $50 that we raise, we’re able to propogate, graft, and manage a pure Nacional tree until it safely reaches maturity, which is a five-year process. That said, the success of this project depends on planting enough trees in enough different farms to ensure the survival of this genetic variety. What is the magic number of trees required to achieve that goal? 500? 1,000? 2,000? It’s impossible to put an exact number on it. Our belief is that 1,000 trees would provide a strong foundation from which to rebuild this genetic variety, although our long-term goal is much higher. We will plant as many trees as we can with the funds we raise.</p><p><b>What are the Risks Associated with the Project?</b></p><p>The greatest risk to this project is time—especially time wasted. The first risk is that one or several of these trees will die before we’re able to propagate them. This
is mitigated by moving on this project quickly. Once the young seedlings have been grafted with scion material from the pure old-growth trees, the next issue is the health of the graft itself. Tree grafts in the tropics require skillful execution and proper care for the first few years of growth, to ensure the health of the graft and its primacy over other branches. This requires close personal attention and on-going management for the life of the tree, with particular emphasis on its first five years. Timely pruning and organic soil fertilization greatly improve the odds that each tree not only survives, but thrives. Spreading
these golden seedlings around to many different farms also hedges against
unforeseen tree deaths at any one given farm. </p><p><b>What qualifications do we have to do this?</b></p><p>To’ak co-founder Jerry Toth has eight years of conservation and sustainable agroforestry field experience in coastal Ecuador. As co-founder of the nonprofit rainforest conservation foundation Third Millennium Alliance, Jerry has managed the reforestation of over 10,000 trees in the region, including several thousand cacao trees. Project coordinator Servio Pachard is a fourth generation cacao farmer who has been planting and managing cacao trees his entire life. Servio was a field technician for the Ecuadorian government’s agricultural investigation institute (INIAP) and is an agroforestry instructor at the University of Calceta.

</ul><br/><br/></div>","The revered and elusive Ecuadorian cacao variety known as
“Nacional” traces its genetic lineage back 5,300 years. As of seven years ago, it was
believed to be extinct. In the remote valley of Piedra de Plata we found nine
cacao trees that are 100% genetically pure Nacional—verified by DNA testing.
Each of these old-growth trees are at the end of their lifespan. When they die,
thousands of years of flavor evolution will die with them. We want to save this
ancient heirloom cacao variety from extinction by reproducing these trees through
grafting and seed propagation. We need your help to do this. In exchange, we
offer you our chocolate and cherished cacao from Piedra de Plata in various different forms:

Nacional’s genetic lineage goes back 5,300 years ago in
Ecuador, which is now recognized as the native origin of cacao. In recent
centuries, Nacional reached global fame for its trademark floral aroma and
complex flavor profile. Then in 1916 the variety was decimated by an outbreak
of Witches’ Broom disease throughout the country, and a century of
hybridization followed. By the beginning of the 21st century it was believed
that genetically pure Nacional no longer existed. 
To’ak was born from a rainforest conservation project in Ecuador in 2007. For many years we quietly made chocolate by hand in a bamboo thatched house without electricity in the middle of our forest preserve. Then in 2013, in the remote valley of Piedra de Plata, we found one of the last known remnants of pure Nacional cacao. Many trees in this valley are so old that they pre-date the hybridization wave that began a century ago. Through the help of genetic testing provided by the Heirloom Cacao Preservation Initiative (HCP), To’ak identified nine trees in Piedra de Plata that are genetically pure Nacional. Each of these trees is estimated to be over one hundred years old, which is considered the end of a cacao tree’s lifespan. Several of these trees are visibly ailing due to old age. These last surviving trees represent a living museum of what is most likely the most ancient cacao variety on earth. They are a connection to the dawn of humanity’s love affair with chocolate.  Out of an estimated 25 million cacao trees in Ecuador, only fifteen are DNA-verified to be pure Nacional. That’s 0.0006% of cacao in Ecuador, the native birthplace of cacao. Nine out of these fifteen trees reside in the valley of Piedra de Plata[Photo] Number ""7"" out of  the nine pure Nacional cacao trees in the valley.Our goal is to nurse this special variety of cacao back from the brink of extinction through conservation, seed propagation, and grafting. In partnership with the rainforest conservation foundation Third Millennium Alliance and the local farmers of Piedra de Plata, To’ak will reproduce, plant, and manage 1,000 pure Nacional cacao trees in fifteen different local farms and one forest preserve throughout the region. We will provide ongoing management of the trees for the first five years of their lives, until they safely reach maturity. Once fruit production begins in 4-5 years, we will harvest the seeds and begin another round of propagation. We will also meticulously process this special cacao and offer it in all
of its various forms, akin to our To’ak Cacao Sampler reward. And you will taste the historic result.Conservationists and chocolate lovers of the world, we need your help to save this ancient relic and culinary treasure.[Photo] Proudly standing in front of our first DNA-verified 100% Nacional cacao tree, discovered in 2014.The DNA analysis has already been done.

<h3>Great potential, but...</h3>
<p>However, right now the business of edible insects is almost non-existing in the
developed countries. Despite huge potential, it is facing big hurdles connected to both slow moving
legislation, as well as mental obstacles to eating insects among consumers.</p>
<h3>We're on a mission!</h3>
<p>Very much driven by a mission to create and support better and more
conscious businesses, we at <a href=""http://www.invenire.fi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Invenire </a>wanted to do something to change the
situation and help the edible insects industry to become successful. By

</div></div>","All about bugs!
We’re not sure if we love them or hate them, but this campaign is all
about edible bugs! 
By 2050 we’ll be 9 billion people on this planet. We need to rapidly
come up with new ways to produce food in a sustainable way. Edible insects have
the potential to become a very important food source for all of us. They are high
in nutrients and can be produced efficiently and with much less environmental
impacts when compared to almost any other protein source!
Great potential, but...
However, right now the business of edible insects is almost non-existing in the
developed countries. Despite huge potential, it is facing big hurdles connected to both slow moving
legislation, as well as mental obstacles to eating insects among consumers.
We're on a mission!
Very much driven by a mission to create and support better and more
conscious businesses, we at Invenire wanted to do something to change the
situation and help the edible insects industry to become successful. By
coincidence we met 4Ento (a Swiss-based communication
and awareness platform promoting edible insects as a sustainable food and protein
alternative) and we knew we had found the right company!



Via this campaign, we want to do 2 important things:

In order to really matter and make a difference,
the edible insects industry needs to reach much bigger consumer groups than today. We think that for it to achieve a wide sustainability impact, it needs a roadmap. 
That is why we’ve started this campaign – we want to do two
important things:




Produce
and publish a business opportunity report. The aim of the work is to present a
clear view of where the edible insects market is right now, but most
importantly, show the roadmap of how it can develop forward into a more
mainstream market with greater positive impact. 


Support the little team of 4Ento in their important educational
work to increase awareness and familiarise people with edible insects so that
more and more people become aware of the opportunities edible insects provide, and
also dare to try insects themselves! If we in some way can help change makers
like 4Ento in their quest for more sustainable – responsible business – we’ll
do our best!

</h3>
We bring awareness to the ongoing destruction of butterfly habitats in our neighborhoods and communities.  We do this by offering an interactive wildlife experience like no-other where children and adults learn first hand about  butterflies in our portable butterfly house.  <br/><br/><h3>What We Do</h3>We have been promoting the re-population of butterflies in the Gold Coast of Australia for several years.  Our passion quickly became a businesses when we discovered that physical interaction with children and parents provide the best education and re-population results, and it is also a great way to make money. <br/><br/>We have created a step-by-step program where anyone can start their own butterfly or invertebrate business and earn a generous and rewarding income while working at their own leisure.  It's time to take it to the next level.  <br/><br/><h3>What We Need</h3>
1.  A new, custom designed fly-house, specific for Butterfly Dreamland entrepreneurs that can be set up in 20-30 minutes.<br/>2. A new, professional Global website with login and support for BD business owners showing times and locations where people can find a Butterfly Dreamland fly house and book a fly house for their party or event. <br/>3. New, professional photo and marketing materials for BD business owners. <br/><br/>
<h3>Be Your Own Boss!<br/>
</h3>
<p>A Butterfly Dreamland entrepreneur attends art &amp; crafts markets, birthday parties, 
county fairs, school events, rodeos and special events of all kinds.  
What an experience to be surrounded by butterflies and to feed them on the tips of your fingers!<br/></p>
<p>We typically work three days a week at the markets. We charge a fee for entry, photos, souvenirs and we provide free literature.  No traveling is required and revenues can be as high as $5,000+ daily at large events and as low as $200 on a bad market day with only 30-40 entries.  <br/></p>
<p>This business is ideal for people that are good with kids, like the outdoors and want flexible work hours.  It's about living an outdoor, healthier lifestyle. <br/></p>
<p>The global Butterfly Dreamland business will promote the planting of butterfly gardens in our backyards and communities, teach parents and children when and where to spray for insects, the types of plants needed to attract each species of butterflies, and the basic fundamentals about butterflies and their life cycles.  And because you will be releasing butterflies on a regular basis, your community will benefit from a butterfly re-population.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Depending on your location, this business may be classified as seasonal. You may not be able to operate, or want to operate, full-time during the Winter months.  However we offer a unique system that we developed from several years of trial and error, allowing Butterfly Dreamland business owners to operate at night events 
and during the mild Winter months when butterflies are supposed to be sleeping. <br/></p>
<p>Apart from the mobile fly house, you will need to build a stationary butterfly house to grow and raise your butterflies.   Drawings are supplied with your business kit and it takes about 5-6 hours to build the octagon modular fly house at a cost of approximately $600 in materials from your local hardware store.  Some skills with a saw and drill are required. </p>
<p>To run this business successfully, you will need to be able set up your mobile butterfly house, which is a custom made 3m x 6m marquee.  Elderly and physically challenged people may not be able to do this on their own.</p>
<p>This business is also not for the bug squeamish. If you have issues with butterflies or caterpillars than please click the ""back"" button now.   <br/></p>
<p>Also, if you are an introvert, you will need to learn to become an extravert, as you will meet dozens, if not hundreds of new people weekly, wanting to learn more about your butterflies and your business.   <br/></p>

<p>As a former steelworker struggling to make ends meet and raise three children, I know what it was like to face challenges in my youth. When I became elected as Councillor for Ward 7 in Hamilton, I fought to improve the lives of students by working to make transit more accessible. I also worked with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities to make housing more affordable so that owning a home can finally be within reach amidst rising tuition costs.</p>
<p>If elected, I hope to continue improving the lives of students and youth at the Federal level. I want to restore the Federal government's role in making education more accessible and affordable. By implementing the Innovation Tax Credit for Entrepreneurs and ensuring that interns receive the same protection as other workers, students and youth will have the opportunities, as well as the tools and experience necessary, to break into the workforce.</p>
<p>I will also work to deliver a $15 per day national child care plan, which will help make living more affordable for students and youth with children. Hamilton needs someone to represent them, and ensure that transit and housing are accessible while tackling the rising debt students are facing.

</div></div>","About Scott



As a former steelworker struggling to make ends meet and raise three children, I know what it was like to face challenges in my youth. When I became elected as Councillor for Ward 7 in Hamilton, I fought to improve the lives of students by working to make transit more accessible. I also worked with the Federation of Canadian Municipalities to make housing more affordable so that owning a home can finally be within reach amidst rising tuition costs.
If elected, I hope to continue improving the lives of students and youth at the Federal level. I want to restore the Federal government's role in making education more accessible and affordable. By implementing the Innovation Tax Credit for Entrepreneurs and ensuring that interns receive the same protection as other workers, students and youth will have the opportunities, as well as the tools and experience necessary, to break into the workforce.
I will also work to deliver a $15 per day national child care plan, which will help make living more affordable for students and youth with children. Hamilton needs someone to represent them, and ensure that transit and housing are accessible while tackling the rising debt students are facing. Make your voice heard by contributing to the Scott Duvall campaign!
   Why Donate? 
It doesn't matter if it is $1 or the maximum donation of $1500, every donation to a candidate's campaign is a show of support and greatly appreciated. 
With Harper's extension of the election period, it is more important than ever that we all show our support financially and come together as a community to support our candidate. Please note, however, that only Canadian residents can donate.
Did you know that all Canadians with taxable income receive generous tax credits when they donate to Canada’s NDP? When donating any amount to this campaign, please ensure you have claimed the ""Tax Receipt"" perk so that you are mailed a receipt!
You get back:

75% for the first $400 you donate.
50% for the next $350 you donate.
33 1/3% of the rest.

<h3>To open a new Community Center, we need to raise $125,000</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $125,000 that will go into securing a location, purchasing equipment and starting programs to serve veterans in the winning state location. We need to fund these items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fund location - Need at least 3000 square feet of space</li>
<li>Pay for the massage/acupuncture beds and fund these programs</li>

<h2>The Vision</h2>
<p>What began as a peek into the window of this beautiful iconic building has turned into a vision for Ventura that has founders Jim Rice and Linda Jordan, along with their team, working day and night to bring Peiranos Market back to life.</p>
<p>When you walk into the market all your senses are going to be awakened.  You will be drawn in by the vast array of colors of locally sourced fruits, vegetables, and fresh flowers.  The aromas of freshly brewed coffee and just baked Italian pastries will sweep over you.  Mouthwatering and inventive flavor profiles from the delicatessen will challenge and rouse your tastebuds like never before.  You will be able to  enjoy your favorite deli sandwich or your own specialty salad on the expansive patio next to the sights and sounds of the bubbling fountain with the soft caress of the ocean breeze.  Immerse  yourself in bustling conversation and  laughter in a marketplace that is alive with energy.</p>
<h3>The Video that Started it All!</h3>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>“Our vision is for Peirano’s Market to be a place for all Venturans to come and feel welcome.  A town center.  A place where people meet, families gather, and food experiences are shared.”  </i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:240px;"">- Jim Rice &amp; Linda Jordan, Founders</p>
<h2>The Concept</h2>
<p>The Peirano's Market is rich with history. It takes us back to a simpler less hectic time where you had a moment to chat with the owner, run into your neighbors and catch up, share stories. It was a place and time where you experienced a true sense of community.  Our goal is to honor that proud history while implementing the best of today's technology, service, and features.</p>
<p>The delicatessen will be something to behold featuring in-house cured meats, prepared foods, and family meals to go. There will be a combination of deli staples and favorites, sandwiches beyond your wildest dreams, plus culinary adventures made from local harvest.  There will be fresh brewed coffee, homemade pastries and desserts, a world class salad bar, and a selection of healthy, organic juices.  </p>
<p>The butcher shop portion of the market will feature an impressive variety of locally sourced meats.  Our fish section will feature the best of our local sustainable catches.  </p>
<p>All of this can be enjoyed at your home, office, or on the beautiful, state-of-the-art patio (architect rendering pictured below) facing out to Figueroa Plaza and Mission Park.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485476504/taf47xlrir70lkrn5xyg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Jim and Linda’s first order of business was to seek out a classically trained chef who aligned with their vision.  Their first call was to Executive Chef Tim Kilcoyne (<i>SideCar Restaurant, Scratch Food Truck</i>) who immediately agreed to bring his culinary skills to deliver one of the most delectable menus this town has ever seen.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484242182/op51maxbhrpvd2pa6vct.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Chef Tim's relationship with local ranchers and farmers is unparalleled. The market will feature the best and brightest in local produce, meat, and fish from Ventura County’s bountiful community.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>""I moved here to be in the center of the best agriculture in the Country.  I’m so excited to bring this bounty to every dish I create.""</i> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:240px;"">-Tim Kilcoyne, Executive Chef</p>
<h2>The “Why”</h2>
<p>This endeavor is about more than bringing back a historic market. It is about the revitalization of one of the most beautiful and significant areas of Ventura. It is where our town was born. It is a magical location where you can see the surf break at C Street from the Mission steps. It is a place of historical significance, with China Alley, Figueroa Plaza, and the 150 year old fig tree in Mission Park.</p>
<p>This area is not the the thriving community center it once was, however it's potential is undeniable and Peirano's Market &amp; Delicatessen can be the catalyst of its revitalization.</p>
<p>The market is strategically located to bring change to this area and the founders have a plan in place that is currently underway and need your help to bring it fully to fruition.  <u><strong>Here's the plan:</strong></u></p>
<h2>Activate Mission Park/Figueroa Plaza</h2>
<p>Jim and Linda, like so many others, believe that Mission Park is one of the most beautiful and under utilized gems in Ventura.  Their  goal is to fill this park with activities that celebrate community and families, to make and keep this park safe and clean. Peirano’s is in position A to have a positive impact on this historical and beautiful  part of town.  They are already working in collaboration with the City of Ventura, Parks Department, the DVP (Downtown Ventura Partners), Turning Point Foundation, and our neighbors to activate Mission Park. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483593965/f3ykcrhw7yd9xlgzouw9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Peirano’s Market will be the cornerstone and driving force for a series of events that will feature the plaza’s original purpose as a community gathering spot.</p>
<ul>
<li>Farmer’s Market</li>
<li>Car Shows</li>
<li>Peirano’s Picnics and Music in the Park</li>
<li>Movies in the Park</li>
<li>Shakespeare in the Park</li>
<li>Yoga Classes</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve ever stood at the fountain in Figueroa Plaza and looked back to the ocean you can agree it is one of the most beautiful places in Ventura.  It’s the city’s birthplace.  Jim &amp; Linda want to have more Venturans enjoy its historic beauty.</p>
<p>First step, our state of the art patio. Our comfortable and accommodating outdoor seating will be bustling morning, noon, and early evening with friends and family enjoying the best food and drink that Ventura has to offer. Those that choose to stay as opposed to taking their food “to go” will get to relax and enjoy our comfortable outdoor seating, the charm of the Mission Bells, and revel in the sights of sounds of a bustling Mission Park. </p>
<h3>We Brought Recess Back to Mission Park</h3>
<p>The first goal was to increase the use of the park during  the week.  An idea took shape.  Jim &amp; Linda reached out to Father Tom, and Edie Lanphar, the principal of Holy Cross School.  The idea was to bring the students of Holy Cross across to Mission Park for their recess.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483593920/pg42gwyyio3z5alycnte.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This was something that hadn’t been done in over a decade because parents and administrators didn’t see it as safe.  In collaboration with the Downtown Ventura Partners Park Ambassadors program the park is cleared and the children now are able to have their recess on grass, rather than asphalt.</p>
<h2>Let's 'Perk' It Up</h2>
<p>Your contribution will have both an intrinsic and experiential reward.  Pretty sweet right?  Helping the greater good of the community you live in paired with some awesome, exclusive culinary adventures is as 'Win-Win' as it gets.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486251020/fc6vzfzmfjveiphtuuia.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Perks for this campaign include a Peirano's branded picnic basket.  The classically styled baskets will be ready to be packed to the brim with Peirano's goodies and taken along on any outdoor happenings including the upcoming Peirano's Picnics in the Park.</p>
<p>Be ""A Cut Above"" and forever immortalized on the Peirano's Wall of Gratitude. There's a perk for that.  Your family's name will be placed on a cutting board arranged with the others to create an amazing work of art greeting each customer as they enter the store.  Make sure you choose a perk at $500 and above to secure your place in history.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486253950/zj4wmpbqpukwawhoyw4n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>If you are one for experiences there is no shortage of those.  Whether it be cooking classes, an intimate dinner with the founders, an exclusive menu preview, or being one of the first to book the private Brewster Room for your event you culinary thrill seekers will have your needs covered.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486413805/rlav44maozfegvyzxfvp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The pièce de résistance?  Included with the top tier perk is the Peirano's Patron Card which is good for 10% off all purchases for an entire year (up to $500/month, alcohol excluded).</p>
<p>Don't have a perk in mind?  Not a problem at all.  Any dollar amount that you choose to give is appreciated and paramount to the progress of this project.  Simply click the 'Back It' button and enter your contribution amount there.</p>
<h2>We're In This Together</h2>
<p>Peirano's has already received incredible support from the residents and nearby businesses who appreciate the vision and see what an incredible catalyst it will be be for the rebirth of the West side of Main Street.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484242498/tkxwtimnhxramir2qh8m.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>John Silva of the DuPuis Group, a nationally renown advertising agency headquartered in Downtown Ventura had graciously offered to head an advisory council for Peirano's Market &amp; Delicatessen.  Hear what he had to say about this project:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>""For more than twenty years I've had the honor of working on some of the world's most recognized brands and I can tell you that beyond commerce and sales they all need and want one thing--- TO MATTER. That's the hard part because you can't back into having authentic purpose. From the moment we all heard about the push by Jim and Linda to re-imagine and reopen our town's iconic Peirano's Market and Deli, didn't we all feel a little rush of pride and inspiration? I did, because that market is a fond piece of our shared history here in this city and will be an authentic, addition to it's prosperous future-- even catalytic to revitalization. That's why I am supporting Jim and Linda and will be doing what I can to help this dream become a reality. Ventura's soul and authentic community will get a bump the moment the doors open! Let's do this.""</i></p>
<h2>It Comes Down to You</h2>
<p>Jim &amp; Linda want this to be <strong><i>your</i></strong> market. They have embraced this endeavor and responsibility.  They have built a team of people overflowing with talent and grounded with integrity.  They have a business plan that will only feature the best of everything.  The best bread.  The best pastries.  The best sandwiches.  The best menu.  The best...well, you get the picture.</p>
<p><u>The best will be achieved without compromise</u>.  The word ""compromise"" is not in the DNA of Peirano's Market &amp; Delicatessen nor in its founders.  They are “All In” and now they need your help.  </p>
<p><strong>Your contribution will go to</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing cutting edge equipment and technology so Peirano's can serve you better</li>
<li>Helping speed up the construction and development process so Peirano's can open sooner</li>

</div></div>","The Vision
What began as a peek into the window of this beautiful iconic building has turned into a vision for Ventura that has founders Jim Rice and Linda Jordan, along with their team, working day and night to bring Peiranos Market back to life.
When you walk into the market all your senses are going to be awakened.  You will be drawn in by the vast array of colors of locally sourced fruits, vegetables, and fresh flowers.  The aromas of freshly brewed coffee and just baked Italian pastries will sweep over you.  Mouthwatering and inventive flavor profiles from the delicatessen will challenge and rouse your tastebuds like never before.  You will be able to  enjoy your favorite deli sandwich or your own specialty salad on the expansive patio next to the sights and sounds of the bubbling fountain with the soft caress of the ocean breeze.  Immerse  yourself in bustling conversation and  laughter in a marketplace that is alive with energy.

“Our vision is for Peirano’s Market to be a place for all Venturans to come and feel welcome.  A town center.  A place where people meet, families gather, and food experiences are shared.”  
- Jim Rice & Linda Jordan, Founders
The Concept
The Peirano's Market is rich with history. It takes us back to a simpler less hectic time where you had a moment to chat with the owner, run into your neighbors and catch up, share stories. It was a place and time where you experienced a true sense of community.  Our goal is to honor that proud history while implementing the best of today's technology, service, and features.
The delicatessen will be something to behold featuring in-house cured meats, prepared foods, and family meals to go. There will be a combination of deli staples and favorites, sandwiches beyond your wildest dreams, plus culinary adventures made from local harvest.  There will be fresh brewed coffee, homemade pastries and desserts, a world class salad bar, and a selection of healthy, organic juices.  
The butcher shop portion of the market will feature an impressive variety of locally sourced meats.  Our fish section will feature the best of our local sustainable catches.  
All of this can be enjoyed at your home, office, or on the beautiful, state-of-the-art patio (architect rendering pictured below) facing out to Figueroa Plaza and Mission Park.

Jim and Linda’s first order of business was to seek out a classically trained chef who aligned with their vision.  Their first call was to Executive Chef Tim Kilcoyne (SideCar Restaurant, Scratch Food Truck) who immediately agreed to bring his culinary skills to deliver one of the most delectable menus this town has ever seen.

Chef Tim's relationship with local ranchers and farmers is unparalleled. The market will feature the best and brightest in local produce, meat, and fish from Ventura County’s bountiful community.
""I moved here to be in the center of the best agriculture in the Country.  I’m so excited to bring this bounty to every dish I create."" 
-Tim Kilcoyne, Executive Chef
The “Why”
This endeavor is about more than bringing back a historic market. It is about the revitalization of one of the most beautiful and significant areas of Ventura. It is where our town was born. It is a magical location where you can see the surf break at C Street from the Mission steps. It is a place of historical significance, with China Alley, Figueroa Plaza, and the 150 year old fig tree in Mission Park.
This area is not the the thriving community center it once was, however it's potential is undeniable and Peirano's Market & Delicatessen can be the catalyst of its revitalization.
The market is strategically located to bring change to this area and the founders have a plan in place that is currently underway and need your help to bring it fully to fruition.  Here's the plan:
Activate Mission Park/Figueroa Plaza
Jim and Linda, like so many others, believe that Mission Park is one of the most beautiful and under utilized gems in Ventura.  Their  goal is to fill this park with activities that celebrate community and families, to make and keep this park safe and clean. Peirano’s is in position A to have a positive impact on this historical and beautiful  part of town.  They are already working in collaboration with the City of Ventura, Parks Department, the DVP (Downtown Ventura Partners), Turning Point Foundation, and our neighbors to activate Mission Park. 

Peirano’s Market will be the cornerstone and driving force for a series of events that will feature the plaza’s original purpose as a community gathering spot.

Farmer’s Market
Car Shows
Peirano’s Picnics and Music in the Park
Movies in the Park
Shakespeare in the Park
Yoga Classes

If you’ve ever stood at the fountain in Figueroa Plaza and looked back to the ocean you can agree it is one of the most beautiful places in Ventura.  It’s the city’s birthplace.  Jim & Linda want to have more Venturans enjoy its historic beauty.
First step, our state of the art patio. Our comfortable and accommodating outdoor seating will be bustling morning, noon, and early evening with friends and family enjoying the best food and drink that Ventura has to offer. Those that choose to stay as opposed to taking their food “to go” will get to relax and enjoy our comfortable outdoor seating, the charm of the Mission Bells, and revel in the sights of sounds of a bustling Mission Park. 
We Brought Recess Back to Mission Park
The first goal was to increase the use of the park during  the week.  An idea took shape.  Jim & Linda reached out to Father Tom, and Edie Lanphar, the principal of Holy Cross School.  The idea was to bring the students of Holy Cross across to Mission Park for their recess.  

This was something that hadn’t been done in over a decade because parents and administrators didn’t see it as safe.  In collaboration with the Downtown Ventura Partners Park Ambassadors program the park is cleared and the children now are able to have their recess on grass, rather than asphalt.
Let's 'Perk' It Up
Your contribution will have both an intrinsic and experiential reward.  Pretty sweet right?  Helping the greater good of the community you live in paired with some awesome, exclusive culinary adventures is as 'Win-Win' as it gets.

Perks for this campaign include a Peirano's branded picnic basket.  The classically styled baskets will be ready to be packed to the brim with Peirano's goodies and taken along on any outdoor happenings including the upcoming Peirano's Picnics in the Park.
Be ""A Cut Above"" and forever immortalized on the Peirano's Wall of Gratitude. There's a perk for that.  Your family's name will be placed on a cutting board arranged with the others to create an amazing work of art greeting each customer as they enter the store.  Make sure you choose a perk at $500 and above to secure your place in history.

If you are one for experiences there is no shortage of those.  Whether it be cooking classes, an intimate dinner with the founders, an exclusive menu preview, or being one of the first to book the private Brewster Room for your event you culinary thrill seekers will have your needs covered.

The pièce de résistance?  Included with the top tier perk is the Peirano's Patron Card which is good for 10% off all purchases for an entire year (up to $500/month, alcohol excluded).
Don't have a perk in mind?  Not a problem at all.  Any dollar amount that you choose to give is appreciated and paramount to the progress of this project.  Simply click the 'Back It' button and enter your contribution amount there.
We're In This Together
Peirano's has already received incredible support from the residents and nearby businesses who appreciate the vision and see what an incredible catalyst it will be be for the rebirth of the West side of Main Street.

John Silva of the DuPuis Group, a nationally renown advertising agency headquartered in Downtown Ventura had graciously offered to head an advisory council for Peirano's Market & Delicatessen.  Hear what he had to say about this project:
""For more than twenty years I've had the honor of working on some of the world's most recognized brands and I can tell you that beyond commerce and sales they all need and want one thing--- TO MATTER. That's the hard part because you can't back into having authentic purpose. From the moment we all heard about the push by Jim and Linda to re-imagine and reopen our town's iconic Peirano's Market and Deli, didn't we all feel a little rush of pride and inspiration? I did, because that market is a fond piece of our shared history here in this city and will be an authentic, addition to it's prosperous future-- even catalytic to revitalization. That's why I am supporting Jim and Linda and will be doing what I can to help this dream become a reality. Ventura's soul and authentic community will get a bump the moment the doors open! Let's do this.""
It Comes Down to You
Jim & Linda want this to be your market. They have embraced this endeavor and responsibility.  They have built a team of people overflowing with talent and grounded with integrity.  They have a business plan that will only feature the best of everything.  The best bread.  The best pastries.  The best sandwiches.  The best menu.  The best...well, you get the picture.
The best will be achieved without compromise.  The word ""compromise"" is not in the DNA of Peirano's Market & Delicatessen nor in its founders.  They are “All In” and now they need your help.  
Your contribution will go to:

Providing cutting edge equipment and technology so Peirano's can serve you better
Helping speed up the construction and development process so Peirano's can open sooner
Supporting the activation of Mission Park & Figueroa Plaza featuring a full calendar of family and cultural events

Remember that when you contribute, every time you walk in the door from opening day forward you’ll know you played a fundamental role in the revitalization of Ventura’s most historic gathering place.  Be the change!

We couldn’t have been more humbled by the outpouring of support we have received thus far.  So many views of our video, so many shares, so many messages saying you can’t wait for us to open.  Please contribute what you can and continue on this journey with us.  Thank you very, very much.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We, at Tetratos, have built a prototype small business Intrusion Detection/Intrusion Protection and Security Information and Event management device prototype that we are looking for funding to take from prototype to production. This device will be a 24/7 cloud-managed device protecting the internal networks of small business that cannot typically afford the cybersecurity framework that is currently available and is one of the main causes that small businesses are the primary target of hackers worldwide. It is designed to provide:</p>
<p>Security Analytics, Intrusion Detection, Log Data Analysis, File Integrity Monitoring, Vulnerability Detection, Configuration Assessment, Incident Response, Regulatory Compliance, Cloud Security Monitoring, Containers Security and malware analysis. </p>
<p>It will be a cost-effective solution for internal security, network audits, Intrusion detection, and prevention, early warning of malicious traffic and event log alerting to a security operations center, providing small business with a way to prevent and recover from malicious activity effectively and maintain regulatory compliance like HIPAA, PCI, SOX, ect. </p>
<p>It is the only thing like it that will be offered at a price range that a small business can afford that is backed by a managed security operations center. There are devices like this, but with an entry point and annual cost that make them cost prohibitive to operate and are outside of what small businesses can even consider.</p>
<p>Help us help Small Business and be a part of the solution!</p>
<p><strong>About Tetratos Managed Technology and Security</strong></p>
<p>We are not your typical Managed Service Provider (MSP). We are also not your typical Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP).  We have taken leadership from both models and formed Tetratos, a Managed Technology and Security Services Provider.</p>
<p>The partnership team at Tetratos have worked in the enterprise and MSP worlds for many years. We have seen the ownership at other companies bait and switch their clients. We have watched MSPs make promises of delivery and then underdeliver.</p>
<p>We have witnessed them overprice their hardware and software sales multiple times over MSRP, just because the client wouldn't be able to identify that they were paying two to three times what you could get just off Amazon alone.</p>
<p>We have seen ownership at MSPs monitor individual email boxes of their client's decision-makers without permission, thereby violating privacy laws without recourse. </p>
<p>We have actually been told by an owner that ""Client's are just a commodity to be traded between MSPs annually. You lose one to a competitor and you gain one of theirs.""</p>
<p><strong>Tetratos has decided enough is enough!</strong></p>
<p>We have built our practice on three pillars. <strong>Honor, Loyalty, and Commitment!</strong></p>
<p>We are a veteran-owned technology firm that wants to be a partner with our clients, not just a vendor that they do business with! That means when you have a technical issue that is affecting your ability to produce, it affects us too, we take it personally.</p>
<p><strong>We put our heart in our work and that shows in the outcome of our product. </strong></p>
<p>While most MSPs claim that they offer security services, they define these as putting in a firewall and managed anti-virus. Tetratos offers all the advantages of an MSP plus the full MSSP stack from 24x7 Security Operations Center, real-time traffic analysis, Vulnerability and Penetration testing with remediation and much more. </p>
<p><i><strong>Most importantly we have been developing and have reached a proven prototype stage of a network security device that is plug and play for the customer but provides real-time traffic analysis for viruses, malware, ransomware, shadow IT, illegal activity, unapproved software or hardware, internal vulnerability testing, and reporting, SecureDNS, and regulatory compliance assessments all in one device. This device is cost-effective for the small business market which statistically is the most targeted industry by hackers.  </strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>While a proper Unified Threat Management/Next-Generation Firewall is great for what we refer to as ""North/South"" traffic, our device is designed to monitor and reports on the ""East/West"" traffic a.ka. the noise inside your network. </strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>Again, the key here is being able to protect the Small and Medium-sized business market. The Fortune 500 have the funding to afford large robust cybersecurity frameworks, toolsets, and staff. Our key market does not. </strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>Our next step is to take our proven prototype and make it manageable from a secure cloud infrastructure allowing a 360 view by our security teams. </strong></i></p>
<p>There are three key partners in the vision that is Tetratos:</p>
<p><strong>Stephen Turner:</strong></p>
<p>Stephen Turner is a 25-year veteran of the Information Technology world. His career began as a crypto technician in the United States Marine Corps.  He has worked all facets of the Information Technology world including administration, security, consulting, project management, Director and as a Chief Information Officer for a nationwide organization where he was responsible for architecting the security infrastructure during the migration of the organization’s entire data center to the “cloud”.  </p>

</div></div>","Summary
We, at Tetratos, have built a prototype small business Intrusion Detection/Intrusion Protection and Security Information and Event management device prototype that we are looking for funding to take from prototype to production. This device will be a 24/7 cloud-managed device protecting the internal networks of small business that cannot typically afford the cybersecurity framework that is currently available and is one of the main causes that small businesses are the primary target of hackers worldwide. It is designed to provide:
Security Analytics, Intrusion Detection, Log Data Analysis, File Integrity Monitoring, Vulnerability Detection, Configuration Assessment, Incident Response, Regulatory Compliance, Cloud Security Monitoring, Containers Security and malware analysis. 
It will be a cost-effective solution for internal security, network audits, Intrusion detection, and prevention, early warning of malicious traffic and event log alerting to a security operations center, providing small business with a way to prevent and recover from malicious activity effectively and maintain regulatory compliance like HIPAA, PCI, SOX, ect. 
It is the only thing like it that will be offered at a price range that a small business can afford that is backed by a managed security operations center. There are devices like this, but with an entry point and annual cost that make them cost prohibitive to operate and are outside of what small businesses can even consider.
Help us help Small Business and be a part of the solution!
About Tetratos Managed Technology and Security
We are not your typical Managed Service Provider (MSP). We are also not your typical Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP).  We have taken leadership from both models and formed Tetratos, a Managed Technology and Security Services Provider.
The partnership team at Tetratos have worked in the enterprise and MSP worlds for many years. We have seen the ownership at other companies bait and switch their clients. We have watched MSPs make promises of delivery and then underdeliver.
We have witnessed them overprice their hardware and software sales multiple times over MSRP, just because the client wouldn't be able to identify that they were paying two to three times what you could get just off Amazon alone.
We have seen ownership at MSPs monitor individual email boxes of their client's decision-makers without permission, thereby violating privacy laws without recourse. 
We have actually been told by an owner that ""Client's are just a commodity to be traded between MSPs annually. You lose one to a competitor and you gain one of theirs.""
Tetratos has decided enough is enough!
We have built our practice on three pillars. Honor, Loyalty, and Commitment!
We are a veteran-owned technology firm that wants to be a partner with our clients, not just a vendor that they do business with! That means when you have a technical issue that is affecting your ability to produce, it affects us too, we take it personally.
We put our heart in our work and that shows in the outcome of our product. 
While most MSPs claim that they offer security services, they define these as putting in a firewall and managed anti-virus. Tetratos offers all the advantages of an MSP plus the full MSSP stack from 24x7 Security Operations Center, real-time traffic analysis, Vulnerability and Penetration testing with remediation and much more. 
Most importantly we have been developing and have reached a proven prototype stage of a network security device that is plug and play for the customer but provides real-time traffic analysis for viruses, malware, ransomware, shadow IT, illegal activity, unapproved software or hardware, internal vulnerability testing, and reporting, SecureDNS, and regulatory compliance assessments all in one device. This device is cost-effective for the small business market which statistically is the most targeted industry by hackers.  
While a proper Unified Threat Management/Next-Generation Firewall is great for what we refer to as ""North/South"" traffic, our device is designed to monitor and reports on the ""East/West"" traffic a.ka. the noise inside your network. 
Again, the key here is being able to protect the Small and Medium-sized business market. The Fortune 500 have the funding to afford large robust cybersecurity frameworks, toolsets, and staff. Our key market does not. 
Our next step is to take our proven prototype and make it manageable from a secure cloud infrastructure allowing a 360 view by our security teams. 
There are three key partners in the vision that is Tetratos:

<h3>Let's Protect Our Health Workers ASAP</h3>
<p>Our <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/hospitals-coronavirus-ppe-shortage.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">frontline health workers don't have the essential protective equipment they need</a> for the COVID-19 epidemic, medical centers are desperately running out of supplies and funds, and big manufacturing will take weeks (or months) to gear up and meet demand.  This really isn't okay.</p>
<p>To help, the Ovadia family has tooled its 37-year old, NJ-based manufacturing business <a href=""http://www.ovadia.com/about.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ovadia Corporation</a> to produce the protective equipment that we can make best: face shields.  According to the <a href=""https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/ppe-strategy/face-masks.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CDC</a> (and dozens of doctors/experts that we consulted), face shields are vital as a first line of defense for healthcare workers working with potential COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>Our goal for the next two weeks is to get at least 10,000 standard face shields into the hands of medical workers as quickly and cheaply as possible to avoid infection (<a href=""https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-italy-healthcare-workers-20200322-iu3qg2ptenehldlyazr4q5k2q4-story.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">nearly 10% of cases in Italy are medical workers!</a>) – while simultaneously keeping American workers proudly and safely employed (we would otherwise be forced to shut down and layoff our full staff).  </p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>We already created the tooling to produce face shields in our New Jersey facility, using our existing workforce that would otherwise be unemployed.  This is a 100% US-made product.</p>
<p>However, company owner Sue Ovadia and her son Moshe (who's volunteering his time) are not in a position to finance this project.  Large sums of money are required upfront to buy the raw materials, and salaries still need to be paid.  We can only do so much.</p>
<p>We are asking for funds to cover the materials + costs/overhead (current salaries, rent, utilities) associated with producing face shields:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our goal is to deliver 10,000+ face shields with $40,000 of funding</li>
<li>Every $4 donated will go towards producing at least one shield, so $20 = at least 5 delivered face shields</li>
<li>This is a profit-free endeavor.  So if we can bring the costs lower than $4/shield, any money leftover would be used to produce more shields</li>
<li>If we fall short of our $40k goal, we'll produce a proportionate number of shields as soon as we raise $10,000 (e.g., $20k=5k shields); if we exceed our goal, we'll produce proportionately more shields.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shields will be donated and delivered directly to needy medical centers in the NY-NJ-CT area – the epicenter of the US epidemic (literally 2/3 of all US cases), and where our plant is based.  To save transit costs, donations would be delivered by Ovadia staff or volunteers to medical centers with stated needs on <a href=""https://getusppe.org/give/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this registry</a>.</p>
<p> </p>

</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Time is Now</h3>
<p>The number of NY-area cases of COVID-19 are increasing exponentially, with the <a href=""https://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/covid-19-infections-rise-york-peak-weeks-69798083"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">peak forecast to be weeks away</a>.  The more healthcare workers we can arm with the protective gear they need and are asking for, the less likely they are to get sick themselves.</p>
<p>To meet this urgency, we have used our initial funds to get as many shield out as possible, with 2,000 already donated by April 22nd.   We will provide regular updates to let you know how things are going on production and donations. </p>
<p>Thank you in advance for collaborating on this effort to support our health workers (and keep a few people employed along the way)!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About the Ovadia Business &amp; People</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.ovadia.com/about.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ovadia Corporation</a> was founded in 1982 in Little Falls, NJ, where we still operate today.  The company was founded by Sue and Joe Ovadia to produce innovative packaging for jewelry.  In our 37 years, we’ve earned 34 patents and sell our 100% American designed and manufactured products across six continents.  Though Joe passed away in 2012, Sue continues to run the business on her own at age 72, along with 17 employees.</p>
<p>When the COVID-19 epidemic began this month, Sue’s son Moshe decided to volunteer his time to help retool the family manufacturing business to be part of the solution.  More on Dr. Moshe Michael Ovadia <a href=""https://pangea.stanford.edu/people/michael-ovadia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> and <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelovadia/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

However, company owner Sue Ovadia and her son Moshe (who's volunteering his time) are not in a position to finance this project.  Large sums of money are required upfront to buy the raw materials, and salaries still need to be paid.  We can only do so much.
We are asking for funds to cover the materials + costs/overhead (current salaries, rent, utilities) associated with producing face shields:

Our goal is to deliver 10,000+ face shields with $40,000 of funding
Every $4 donated will go towards producing at least one shield, so $20 = at least 5 delivered face shields
This is a profit-free endeavor.  So if we can bring the costs lower than $4/shield, any money leftover would be used to produce more shields
If we fall short of our $40k goal, we'll produce a proportionate number of shields as soon as we raise $10,000 (e.g., $20k=5k shields); if we exceed our goal, we'll produce proportionately more shields.

Shields will be donated and delivered directly to needy medical centers in the NY-NJ-CT area – the epicenter of the US epidemic (literally 2/3 of all US cases), and where our plant is based.  To save transit costs, donations would be delivered by Ovadia staff or volunteers to medical centers with stated needs on this registry.
 


 
The Time is Now
The number of NY-area cases of COVID-19 are increasing exponentially, with the peak forecast to be weeks away.  The more healthcare workers we can arm with the protective gear they need and are asking for, the less likely they are to get sick themselves.
To meet this urgency, we have used our initial funds to get as many shield out as possible, with 2,000 already donated by April 22nd.   We will provide regular updates to let you know how things are going on production and donations. 
Thank you in advance for collaborating on this effort to support our health workers (and keep a few people employed along the way)!
 
About the Ovadia Business & People
Ovadia Corporation was founded in 1982 in Little Falls, NJ, where we still operate today.  The company was founded by Sue and Joe Ovadia to produce innovative packaging for jewelry.  In our 37 years, we’ve earned 34 patents and sell our 100% American designed and manufactured products across six continents.  Though Joe passed away in 2012, Sue continues to run the business on her own at age 72, along with 17 employees.
When the COVID-19 epidemic began this month, Sue’s son Moshe decided to volunteer his time to help retool the family manufacturing business to be part of the solution.  More on Dr. Moshe Michael Ovadia here and here.
 
Other Ways You Can Help

Please help spread the word about this effort on social media (and through Indiegogo share tools) to help us meet our goal! 
Backer support is also welcome to:

Spend time on the project as a volunteer for a few hours a day to keep our costs down (for example, we could really use help finding material suppliers, since many vendors are closed or out of stock, and others are price gauging)
Hand delivering face shields to medical centers (for those local to the NY area)
Track down the most needy medical centers for PPE/face shields among the 100+ NY area medical centers in need (our expertise is in making stuff, but we want to be really thoughtful about how we give these away)",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>The Inside Story</strong></p>
<p>In Minnesota, we're all held hostage by the extreme weather conditions. Snow, rain, heat, humidity, bugs  - it all gets in the way of our ability to get our dogs the exercise and socialization they need. Indoor Zoomies is the answer,</p>
<p>Indoor Zoomies is an indoor dog park that can promise the perfect conditions every day no matter the weather. </p>
<p>Indoor Zoomies is needed by all dog lovers, including myself.  There are just too many days where the outdoor park isn't comfortable for me or my dog.  Maybe it rained, maybe it's too cold for my Chihuahua mix, maybe it's too hot for me to stand in the sun and for my dog to run until she's out of energy. So we're bringing the fun indoors</p>
<p>Indoor Zoomies will be more than just a dog park. While dogs might not need much more than open space and another pup buddy, we do. We want to forget that it's cruddy outside. We want to get work done and have a cup of coffee while our dogs play; and we want to make sure our dogs are safe under a watchful eye. I hear you!</p>
<p>Trained professionals will be on the play floor at all times making sure all play is positive and that your pup stays safe. We love dogs, too! We don't want anyone getting scared or hurt. </p>
<p>Lastly, Indoor Zoomies will be partnering local rescues to host adoption events in a comfortable wide-open environment. Foster pups will be able to play, socialize, and show off their natural personalities with perspective families. There will also be special events such as foster dog Yoga and Pilates to help people meet these wonderful dogs.</p>
<p>Indoor Zoomies is so important to me, but it's also important for our dogs. I can't wait to open the doors and meet all your four-legged best friends. </p>

<h3>Community Involvement</h3>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Community involvement is one of the distinguishing features of QforQuran. The
app offers an opportunity for you to initiate a new recitation of the Quran or be part
of a recitation initiated by someone else. When you start a new recitation, you
can invite your friends and family to join you in the reading. The app divides
the recitation into 500 small reading tasks and assigns them to the
participants of your group. Every time a reader finishes an assigned task they can update their progress with few swipes. As soon as the recitation
of the Quran is completed you receive a notification about the reading progress of the
group. This way a community is formed instantly around a single noble cause, making it possible to read the entire Quran in as little as 10 minutes. </p>

Habit Building System:





QforQuran
is not just another Quran reading app, it is a habit building system geared to
develop and improve your relationship  with
the Quran. Embedded with our extensive research, QforQuran analyzes your daily
routine and suggests the best time for you to read the Quran, so that you are able
to achieve your set targets optimally. 
The app also considers your daily,
nightly, and weekly routines to provide recommendations tailored to personally
help you develop a habit of reading the Quran and to strengthen your relationship
with it. 
Quran Reading and Progress Tracking




QforQuran
creates a schedule of daily reading tasks based on whichever target you set. For
example the user may set a target to complete one full recitation of the Quran
in one year. The app will present a timetable  for the whole year with 99 levels or tasks. During
the whole year, the app will readjusts daily and adapts dynamically according to
your progress. 
The app designs a plan and presents it to you.  Moreover, it will send you reminders so that
you can achieve your goal according to your set schedule. The user can always see the reading progress
and targets through the app.


Community Involvement

Community involvement is one of the distinguishing features of QforQuran. The
app offers an opportunity for you to initiate a new recitation of the Quran or be part
of a recitation initiated by someone else. When you start a new recitation, you
can invite your friends and family to join you in the reading. The app divides

group. This way a community is formed instantly around a single noble cause, making it possible to read the entire Quran in as little as 10 minutes. 

So let's connect with each other and with ourselves through QforQuran, 




Why we need the funds?

At this stage QForQuran’s initial design and mock-up screens are ready. But in order to complete the development process, we need the community’s help. We want to ensure that we have a professionally designed system that works successfully and seamlessly with 10 million users from around the world.  We need the funds for the following activities

Development
User testing
Quran text verification
Marketing & promotion
Payroll
Extensive user education
Distribution
Licensing
Consultants
Multiple language support

With community’s support, if we are able to meet our funding goals, inshAllah we will be in a position to fully design and launch our app before Ramadan 2016.
Risks and Challenges



We are staunch believers in lean and agile development of our business and technology, we believe that all the challenges can be overcome through iterative ideation, prototyping and externsive user testing.
We see that as we progress we would require a large group of users to develop and test the community feature of QforQuran further. The key here is diversity. We believe that the more diverse our test-user group is, the more compatible QForQuran will be for a global audience.
Last but not the least we aspire to serve the Arabic speakers and non-Arabic speakers alike. This would require additional features like language support,  Arabic pronunciation guides.
We urge our users to join and help us further improve our business model and app features and to help us face the challenges by sharing their time, knowledge and ideas.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>If you are a wine lover then <a href=""http://winefuse.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WineFuse.com</a> will be your Online destination for anything about wine. Whether you want to share your latest wine experience with your followers, or be informed by wine lovers whom you follow, or learn about wines, or find out about wine events, or want to shop for wine or wine-related items, then <a href=""http://winefuse.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WineFuse.com</a> will be for you. It is the one site where the theme is all about wine, and nothing but wine or wine paraphernalia.</p>
<p>The name says it all. It means to <b>fuse</b>, blend, or bring together a community of wine lovers. Just like different grape varietals are blended or fused together to produce very interesting wines, so does <a href=""http://winefuse.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WineFuse.com</a> fuse together similar and different wine lovers into a common theme, namely wine. Rather than ""wine experts"" telling people what they should drink or like, the <b>WineFuse</b> community is designed for wine lovers to provide insights and feedback to their fellow wine lovers. That does not mean that ""wine experts"" will be excluded from the community. They will be allowed to participate just like any other member. It is up to members to decide who to follow.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>We are a husband and wife team, Jay &amp; Monica Sadie, who represent superb quality wines produced by family-run wine farms. After living in the winelands of South Africa for 6 years, we decided to import South African wines into the USA, and to promote these wines through events and education. It is our pleasure to represent wine farm communities that we have hand-selected for both quality and their passion for making farm to table wines. We are educated and certified in viticulture and wine making through the Cape Wine Academy.</p>
<p>This campaign is important to us due to our love and passion for wine. Wine is not just wine. It is a lifestyle, a conversation starter, a food-enhancer, it brings people together, and it's a way of life to many communities across the globe. People who like wine are for the most part nice people, with an appreciation for the finer things in life. We meet a lot of people in our business and we have found that wine lovers are a pleasure to socialize with.</p>
<p>We came up with the idea to create an Online community for wine lovers for many reasons. The idea did not come overnight, but rather developed over a period of about a year. There are many places to go to on the Internet to read about or locate wines, or to socialize with other wine lovers. But there is no one site dedicated to wine lovers as a community. <a href=""http://winefuse.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WineFuse.com</a> will be this site.</p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign you will make it possible for us to build it. We have already spent some of our own funds to get to this point, however, we need your help to take it to the next level. It will take some time before the site will generate sufficient income to be self-sustaining. Your funds will get us through this initial non-profitable period.</p>

<p><a href=""http://winefuse.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WineFuse.com</a> serves a very precise purpose. It is a social media community for wine lovers, where everything revolves around one single theme... <b>wine</b>. Every piece of information found on this site will either be about wine, or something to do about or in support of wine. There will be no other distractions or non-related subject matter. Only wine!<br/></p>
<p>Here are some examples of what you will be able to do or find on <a href=""http://winefuse.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WineFuse.com</a>:<br/></p>

<li>Locate wine tasting events or wine-related events/tours such as seminars, social gatherings, food parings, wine tours, cruises, etc.</li>
<li>Comprehensive wine database - Wine producers or importers may post information about wines on the Shopping section of <a href=""http://winefuse.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WineFuse.com</a>. Retailers may link to these wines to indicate that it can be bought from them. If they have an Online Sales page then a link can be created to allow members to purchase relevant wines. If a member sees a wine he/she may be interested in the member can ask to see a list of all retailers that carry that wine. The member can limit the list based on State, City, Zip Code or Maximum Distance from a specified location. Another option is to look only at retailers who provide Online Sales.</li>
<li>Once a member has purchased a wine, the member may write a short review and may rate the wine based on<em> the following</em> 100-Point Scale:

<li>

My father is a truck driver and in my childhood I often accompanied him to
the work.Due to this it was my dream for me to be a truck driver. I reached this
childhood dream but then a turning point came to my life. Inspite of my youth, doctors were diagnostic chron's disease in 2009.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crohn%27s_disease)

Due to this disease I had to stop working as a truck driver. It was a black
day in my life. However, I want to remain close to the trucks because this is my life.So then I decided to establish an International Transport company.It's very important to me to help others.I would like to give a well-paid job and pay attention to give as many free time for the driver as I can.

The environment is also very important to me so the trucks what I would like to rent are up-to-date.The vehicles are contains all the safety equipment for the safety driving.

At first I would like to rent two trucks with jobs so the income is guarenteed.PLEASE HELP ME IF YOU CAN.

<p>A Strong 7.9 rector scale Earthquake hit Nepal on Saturday April 25. It has desperately destroyed the ancient historical monuments of Nepal, many houses in Kathmandu and outside of Kathmandu valley. The earthquake was followed by many powerful aftershocks and a new earthquake (6.7) hit Nepal on Sunday April 26. Many (historic) buildings collapsed, temples have been ruined, roads destroyed. More than 7600 deaths in Nepal more than 14400 people are injured and may are still missing. Most of the villagers are homeless.</p>
<p>One of those affected village is Naubise- 3 Dhading Kholegaun Village. We are 18 Kilometer from Kathmandu-Kanalki where inhabitants of about 100 to 110 people and 15 households. Sometime to our village many people called Shadow of Light. Being very near from Kathmandu Valley we don’t have good road, no good toilet, no good tap for water and no strong house. Being Tamang Community most of them are uneducated.</p>
<p>Government Package</p>
<p>Now it has already 12 days of big earthquake. We didn’t get any relief package from our government I have heard that some package has been arrived in VDC office because of political fight they are unable to give to us. We have received some Biscuits, Wai Wai, Tent and Beaten rice from Different Social organization. We are now waiting our government relief pack. We are now waiting our government relief package.</p>
<p>What we have heard</p>
<p>We have heard from different Media and newspaper many foreigners have made billion of USD Dollor Donation to our government to help earthquake victim. If they use it properly every Nepalese people will get 1 million Nepali Rupee to build new house. I am looking the entire news channel after that earthquake many people are carrying big rice sacks with so many foods but we are getting not getting anything at all.</p>
<p>NGO &amp; INGO</p>
<p>I have heard that many NGO and INGO in Nepal brings fund from foreigner two build two toilet and two water tap for every house in Village. But In my village we have no Toilet and we have pipe water but not good tape. I will post photo soon we have paid 7000 Nrs for this project as well.</p>
<p>My Mission</p>
<p>First Phase</p>
<p>After receiving fund from my customers and friends I will buy tent, mat, rice, blanket for my villagers I will go my village and distribute myself with taking all photo graph so that donor will be assured their fund has gone for right peoples.</p>
<p>Second Phase</p>
<p>When I will manage food and shelter for my villagers I will start to build house for my village now my target will be 15 houses in my village which all are damage and can’t be stay. If we are able to raise fund from customer I will make house for them and take photo and send you back. I have many customers who are frequently visiting in Nepal for business proposes I can take him to this house which he has donated.

It cost $ 10000 USD to build a home. Hari lost his village. Read his story below from the April 25th earthquake. 

Another earthquake severly damaged Nepal at 1PM May 12, 2015,

""Helping Hands for Earthquake victims in Nepal
A Strong 7.9 rector scale Earthquake hit Nepal on Saturday April 25. It has desperately destroyed the ancient historical monuments of Nepal, many houses in Kathmandu and outside of Kathmandu valley. The earthquake was followed by many powerful aftershocks and a new earthquake (6.7) hit Nepal on Sunday April 26. Many (historic) buildings collapsed, temples have been ruined, roads destroyed. More than 7600 deaths in Nepal more than 14400 people are injured and may are still missing. Most of the villagers are homeless.
One of those affected village is Naubise- 3 Dhading Kholegaun Village. We are 18 Kilometer from Kathmandu-Kanalki where inhabitants of about 100 to 110 people and 15 households. Sometime to our village many people called Shadow of Light. Being very near from Kathmandu Valley we don’t have good road, no good toilet, no good tap for water and no strong house. Being Tamang Community most of them are uneducated.
Government Package
Now it has already 12 days of big earthquake. We didn’t get any relief package from our government I have heard that some package has been arrived in VDC office because of political fight they are unable to give to us. We have received some Biscuits, Wai Wai, Tent and Beaten rice from Different Social organization. We are now waiting our government relief pack. We are now waiting our government relief package.
What we have heard
We have heard from different Media and newspaper many foreigners have made billion of USD Dollor Donation to our government to help earthquake victim. If they use it properly every Nepalese people will get 1 million Nepali Rupee to build new house. I am looking the entire news channel after that earthquake many people are carrying big rice sacks with so many foods but we are getting not getting anything at all.
NGO & INGO
I have heard that many NGO and INGO in Nepal brings fund from foreigner two build two toilet and two water tap for every house in Village. But In my village we have no Toilet and we have pipe water but not good tape. I will post photo soon we have paid 7000 Nrs for this project as well.
My Mission
First Phase
After receiving fund from my customers and friends I will buy tent, mat, rice, blanket for my villagers I will go my village and distribute myself with taking all photo graph so that donor will be assured their fund has gone for right peoples.
Second Phase
When I will manage food and shelter for my villagers I will start to build house for my village now my target will be 15 houses in my village which all are damage and can’t be stay. If we are able to raise fund from customer I will make house for them and take photo and send you back. I have many customers who are frequently visiting in Nepal for business proposes I can take him to this house which he has donated. So that he will be sure his money has spend for right people and right propose.
How to success this project? 
Now I am working hard to make all my customer happy because if I have 1000 customer If I request to all denote 10 USD I will have 10000 USD that mean we can make one beautiful house in my village. Mean If I request Monthly 10 USD from my all customer we can make 12 houses in one year. All the credit will go customer from Clothing in Nepal and will visit our village while you will be in Nepal.
To support the village, we have started up our fundraising campaign. We would like to humbly request you all fellow Rotarians, non Rotarians and well-wishers to support us individually in our fundraising campaign.

OUR GOAL
We have always believed that no one knows what you can get until you try.
We are convinced that youth is the time to dream, to have big goals, to struggle and strive to achieve them.
Since we started sailing together we have dreamed of the goal of winning the ISAF World Youth and the path we have undertaken together we have brought us one step closer to that goal.



In the last two years we have become national champions in the men's circuit Mexican candle 2013 and 2014. In recent months we have won the Wesmex, and remain in 2nd place in the Cup and the Copa coporito Aaron Saenz. But our greatest achievement has been to qualify for the 2015 ISAF Youth World and have the amazing opportunity to represent Mexico.
ISAF World Youth is competition that brings together the best female and male team per country categories: Laser, RS: X, R 420, SL16 and 29er worldwide.
Many of the winners of the ISAF World Youth become Olympic champions.

GOAL
Our goal is to make a good race and achieve win in the 2015 ISAF World Youth.
By doing so we will stand in a position that will allow us to receive the support of the Mexican Sailing Federation and the CONADE, so you can train harder and closer to our dream.
We are doing this campaign because we need to get in the next 200 days, the best possible preparation, training abroad before the 2015 ISAF World Youth.

Two great friends with a passion for sailing and one dream.
We have trained and competed representing Guerrero in the national circuit, Quintana Roo, Jalisco, Nayarit, Valle de Bravo, Veracruz and Mexico Represented in Portugal (ISAF Youth 2014).

</b>Campidarte è il nome del progetto, è nato nel maggio 2012, come un progetto di tre 3 interior designer, Giampiero Bernazzani, Alberto Brancaleon e Giorgio Deplano, che hanno iniziato a riqualificare quattro capannoni siti nella campagna Sarda. Questi spazi in disuso da 10 anni, erano prima utilizzati come allevamento avicolo e sono parte dell'azienda di Mario Deplano, padre di Giorgio. Nel tempo il team è cambiato e ora a seguire Campidarte ci sono Paolo Carcangiu, Gianluca Zaccariotto, Rita Deplano, Stefano Melis e Giorgio Deplano.<br/></p><p>Il progetto nella sua più ampia evoluzione comprende un'area eventi e agriturismo, una zona dedicata al progetto di residenze d'artista, e un laboratorio per la produzione di prodotti per la casa e allestimenti. Tutto questo in stretto contatto con la natura e dando modo alle diverse attività di mescolarsi tra loro. Campidarte è un progetto in corso, ambizioso, che mira a creare collaborazioni e scambi con le realtà artistiche più vitali dell'isola, e non solo. Inoltre vuole diventare nel tempo un vero punto di riferimento per la musica, il cibo e l'arte, portando in Sardegna un luogo di respiro più ampio collegato ai classici ambienti della piccola isola.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459760389/12615608_965866196832010_1223940785404786097_o_m5egvm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>
<h4>
<b>Argomenti del progetto. </b><br/>
</h4>
<p>Campidarte vuole unire cinque diversi aspetti: <b>natura, arte, design, eventi e cibo</b>. <br/></p>
<p><b>Natura</b>, perché si trova in 16 ettari nel pieno della campagna Sarda. <br/></p>
<p><b>Arte </b>perché Campidarte si caratterizza per il progetto ""Artists in residence"". Gli artisti vengono qui in due modi: breve o lungo periodo. Nel breve periodo di solito gli artisti lasciano delle opere sulle pareti dei capannoni. Nel lungo periodo, che può raggiungere due mesi, lavorano nel terreno creando installazioni permanenti, perché l'idea è quella di creare un <b>parco culturale</b>, creando così una passeggiata tra la natura e le installazioni artistiche. <br/></p>
<p><b>Design.</b> Campidarte vuole creare un nuovo concetto di design, che sia un mix tra il design urbano, riprendendone forme e colori, e quello artigianale o laboratoriale, in cui si sperimenta e realizzano prodotti.  <br/></p>
<p>
<b>Eventi.</b> Durante i primi tre anni abbiamo organizzato una serie di eventi che sono diventati parte importante del progetto, perché, grazie ad essi, i visitatori hanno iniziato a conoscere Campidarte e hanno avuto l'opportunità di vedere in prima persona una nuova modalità di esposizione dell'arte contemporanea, così come un nuovo approccio alla progettazione e al design. Inoltre gli eventi hanno permesso di finanziare la parte relativa agli artisti (l'acquisto di tinte e pennelli, biglietti aerei, l'ospitalità), e per i materiali del laboratorio.<br/></p>
<p><b>Cibo e ospitalità.</b> Apriremo presto anche come agriturismo, per dare una nuova offerta ai nostri clienti. Così da essere in grado di dare servizi e contenuti a persone di età e stili di vita diversi, e fare in modo che Campidarte venga visitato e viva tutto il nostro contesto, puntando su un aumento del confort e dell'atmosfera. <br/></p>
<p>È per questo che chiediamo il vostro sostegno per rendere possibile questo progetto!!</p>
<h3>A cosa servirà il Crowdfunding<br/>
</h3>
<p>Il crowdfunding è fondamentale per portare a termine la ristrutturazione del capannone e garantire così a Campidarte una serena programmazione e promozione delle attività. I lavori da effettuare ammontano ad un investimento di circa 287 mila euro, di cui, grazie alla stipula di due mutui siamo riusciti a garantircene circa 260 mila euro. Con il <b>crowfunding</b> puntiamo a coprirne almeno i 20 mila rimanenti.<br/></p>
<p>Nello specifico i 20 mila euro chiesti andranno a coprire le spese per l'acquisto della cucina attrezzata che sarà il cuore del nascente agriturismo.</p>
<h3>Ecco i regali pensati per voi!</h3>
<p> Finanziare un progetto che ci piace può fare sicuramente piacere! ma se ci sono dei premi in scambio allora può essere anche divertente ed essere visto quasi come un regalo. In questi anni Campidarte ha sviluppato tutta una serie di prodotti per la casa che possono essere un perfetto scambio tra noi!</p>
<p>Le consegne dei prodotti in Sardegna saranno fatte a mano, quindi senza spese di spedizione ;)<br/></p>

<b>The Campidarte project</b><b><h3><b> </b></h3></b><b></b>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>History</b> .Campidarte is the name of the project, was born in May 2012, as a project between 3 interior designer, Giampiero Bernazzani, Alberto Brancaleon and Giorgio Deplano, who 
have begun to redevelop four sheds sites in the Sardinian countryside. 
These were first used as breeding poultry and the company of Mario 
Deplano, father of Giorgio. Over time the team has changed and there 
are now a new team that follow Campidarte, made by Paul Carcangiu, Gianluca Zaccariotto, 
Rita Deplano, Stefano Melis and Giorgio Deplano.</p>
<p><b>Topics of the project.</b> Campidarte wants to combine five different aspects: nature, art, design, events and food. <br/></p>
<p>Nature, because is located in 16 hectares of countryside in Sardinia. <br/></p>
<p>Art because Campidarte is characterized by the project ""artists in residence"". The artists come here in two ways: short or long period.
In the short term usually artists paint the walls.
Over the longer term, which it can reach two months, they work in the outside creating installations, because the idea is to create a cultural path distributed within the area, which offers the opportunity to walk among nature and artist installations. <br/></p>
<p>Campidarte wants to create a new concept of design, that is a mix between the urban design, to which we are commonly used and one more craft that we produce in the laboratory. <br/></p>
<p>During the first four years we have organized a number of events that have become a very important part of the project because, thanks to them, people have started to know Campidarte and have had the opportunity to see first hand contemporary art, as well as a way new approach the design.
Combined with Campidarte events it has the interest to support the artists, purchase the materials they need, and for the lab materials. <br/></p>
<p>This is the reason why we have now decided to renew this shed, which is the event area, to open again also like a farmhouse to bi able to unite people of different ages and lifestyles, and make sure that Campidarte will be able to offer a great and more confortable atmosphere. <br/></p>
<p>That's why we are asking your support to make this project possible!</p>
<h3>
<span><span>What use the Crowdfunding</span></span>
</h3>
<h3><span><span></span></span></h3>
<p><span><span>The crowdfunding is essential to complete the restructuring of the shed and thus ensure Campidarte to programming and promotion of activities. The works to be performed amounts to an investment of around 287 000 euro, of which, thanks to the signing of two loans we managed to garantircene approximately 260 000 euro. With crowfunding we aim to cover the last 20 000 euro..</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Specifically, the 20 000 euro will be asked to cover the cost of purchasing the fully equipped kitchen that will be the heart of the nascent restaurant.</span></span></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3><span>Here are the gifts meant for you!<br/></span></h3>
<p><span>Fund a project that we like can definitely be pleased! but if there are prizes in exchange then it can also be fun and be seen like a gift. In these years Campidarte has developed a whole series of products for the house which can be a perfect exchange between us!</span></p>

Cosa è un crowdfunding? 


Il crowdfunding o finanziamento collettivo in italiano, è un processo collaborativo di un gruppo di persone che utilizza il proprio denaro in comune per sostenere gli sforzi di persone e organizzazioni. È una pratica di microfinanziamento dal basso che mobilita persone e risorse.

    Il progetto Campidarte 
La storia. 
Campidarte è il nome del progetto, è nato nel maggio 2012, come un progetto di tre 3 interior designer, Giampiero Bernazzani, Alberto Brancaleon e Giorgio Deplano, che hanno iniziato a riqualificare quattro capannoni siti nella campagna Sarda. Questi spazi in disuso da 10 anni, erano prima utilizzati come allevamento avicolo e sono parte dell'azienda di Mario Deplano, padre di Giorgio. Nel tempo il team è cambiato e ora a seguire Campidarte ci sono Paolo Carcangiu, Gianluca Zaccariotto, Rita Deplano, Stefano Melis e Giorgio Deplano.Il progetto nella sua più ampia evoluzione comprende un'area eventi e agriturismo, una zona dedicata al progetto di residenze d'artista, e un laboratorio per la produzione di prodotti per la casa e allestimenti. Tutto questo in stretto contatto con la natura e dando modo alle diverse attività di mescolarsi tra loro. Campidarte è un progetto in corso, ambizioso, che mira a creare collaborazioni e scambi con le realtà artistiche più vitali dell'isola, e non solo. Inoltre vuole diventare nel tempo un vero punto di riferimento per la musica, il cibo e l'arte, portando in Sardegna un luogo di respiro più ampio collegato ai classici ambienti della piccola isola.

Argomenti del progetto. 

Campidarte vuole unire cinque diversi aspetti: natura, arte, design, eventi e cibo. 
Natura, perché si trova in 16 ettari nel pieno della campagna Sarda. 
Arte perché Campidarte si caratterizza per il progetto ""Artists in residence"". Gli artisti vengono qui in due modi: breve o lungo periodo. Nel breve periodo di solito gli artisti lasciano delle opere sulle pareti dei capannoni. Nel lungo periodo, che può raggiungere due mesi, lavorano nel terreno creando installazioni permanenti, perché l'idea è quella di creare un parco culturale, creando così una passeggiata tra la natura e le installazioni artistiche. 
Design. Campidarte vuole creare un nuovo concetto di design, che sia un mix tra il design urbano, riprendendone forme e colori, e quello artigianale o laboratoriale, in cui si sperimenta e realizzano prodotti.  

Eventi. Durante i primi tre anni abbiamo organizzato una serie di eventi che sono diventati parte importante del progetto, perché, grazie ad essi, i visitatori hanno iniziato a conoscere Campidarte e hanno avuto l'opportunità di vedere in prima persona una nuova modalità di esposizione dell'arte contemporanea, così come un nuovo approccio alla progettazione e al design. Inoltre gli eventi hanno permesso di finanziare la parte relativa agli artisti (l'acquisto di tinte e pennelli, biglietti aerei, l'ospitalità), e per i materiali del laboratorio.
Cibo e ospitalità. Apriremo presto anche come agriturismo, per dare una nuova offerta ai nostri clienti. Così da essere in grado di dare servizi e contenuti a persone di età e stili di vita diversi, e fare in modo che Campidarte venga visitato e viva tutto il nostro contesto, puntando su un aumento del confort e dell'atmosfera. 
È per questo che chiediamo il vostro sostegno per rendere possibile questo progetto!!
A cosa servirà il Crowdfunding

Il crowdfunding è fondamentale per portare a termine la ristrutturazione del capannone e garantire così a Campidarte una serena programmazione e promozione delle attività. I lavori da effettuare ammontano ad un investimento di circa 287 mila euro, di cui, grazie alla stipula di due mutui siamo riusciti a garantircene circa 260 mila euro. Con il crowfunding puntiamo a coprirne almeno i 20 mila rimanenti.
Nello specifico i 20 mila euro chiesti andranno a coprire le spese per l'acquisto della cucina attrezzata che sarà il cuore del nascente agriturismo.
Ecco i regali pensati per voi!
 Finanziare un progetto che ci piace può fare sicuramente piacere! ma se ci sono dei premi in scambio allora può essere anche divertente ed essere visto quasi come un regalo. In questi anni Campidarte ha sviluppato tutta una serie di prodotti per la casa che possono essere un perfetto scambio tra noi!

During the first four years we have organized a number of events that have become a very important part of the project because, thanks to them, people have started to know Campidarte and have had the opportunity to see first hand contemporary art, as well as a way new approach the design.
Combined with Campidarte events it has the interest to support the artists, purchase the materials they need, and for the lab materials. 
This is the reason why we have now decided to renew this shed, which is the event area, to open again also like a farmhouse to bi able to unite people of different ages and lifestyles, and make sure that Campidarte will be able to offer a great and more confortable atmosphere. 
That's why we are asking your support to make this project possible!

What use the Crowdfunding


The crowdfunding is essential to complete the restructuring of the shed and thus ensure Campidarte to programming and promotion of activities. The works to be performed amounts to an investment of around 287 000 euro, of which, thanks to the signing of two loans we managed to garantircene approximately 260 000 euro. With crowfunding we aim to cover the last 20 000 euro..
Specifically, the 20 000 euro will be asked to cover the cost of purchasing the fully equipped kitchen that will be the heart of the nascent restaurant.

Here are the gifts meant for you!
Fund a project that we like can definitely be pleased! but if there are prizes in exchange then it can also be fun and be seen like a gift. In these years Campidarte has developed a whole series of products for the house which can be a perfect exchange between us!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>San Diego needs a craft hard cider brewery!  Help Serpentine Cider become the first in what will hopefully be a long line of craft cideries.  We are trying to raise $15,000 to help us open a hard cider brewery, tasting room, and kitchen.  We have a 3,500sf warehouse in Miramar close to 2Kids Brewing Company, Thunderhawk Alements, and Setting Sun Sake Brewing Company on Miralani Drive and would like to be open by the end of 2016.</p>
<p>Serpentine Cider is made up of Sean, Kelly, Lish and Matthew.  We are three conservation biologists (focusing on desert reptiles, hence the name 'Serpentine"" Cider) and a Navy helicopter pilot. </p>
<p>We focus on breaking the rules of traditional hard cider making.  Sweet, syrupy, highly carbonated alcoholic sugar water has no place here at Serpentine Cider!  Taking from the amazing craft beer culture of San Diego, we also break tradition by using beer yeast in order to obtain our complex flavors. </p>
<p>Do you think you aren't a cider lover?  Think again!  We have heard from many people that they don't like sweet drinks.  Serpentine Cider has a wide variety of ciders from semi-sweet to dry to some that will rival the sourest of the sour beers.  We will even have a wonderful hopped cider that will make the biggest IPA lover come running.  And yes, all of our ciders are naturally gluten free!</p>
<p>Remember, judging San Diego craft cider based on the apple-flavored alcoholic sugar water on the grocery store shelf is like judging San Diego craft beer based on Budweiser. Taste the real thing for yourself. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal for this campaign is $15,000 and we need your help in order to obtain that goal.  Our tasting room is an empty shell at the moment.  We are trying to raise money for three large fermenters, aging barrels and tanks, a patio, a bar and even a small kitchen.  Cider is the fastest growing craft beverage in the country.  We are here to show San Diego why it is gaining in such popularity.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It is always risky to open a business, but the risk is compounded when that business has not yet been done in your city.  San Diegans have always had a love for craft beverages.  Hard cider is the next branch on San Diego's craft beverage evolutionary tree. </p>

<h3>Who Are We and Why Do We Need Your Help?</h3>
<p>I'm James Suh, owner of CAR CARE AUTO SPA, a hand car wash and detail center in Portage Park, since 2013.</p>
<p>I've always dreamed of owning a small business, and this has been my first venture in addition to my full time job.  At any given time, CAR CARE AUTO SPA employs a team of between 7 - 10 people. </p>
<p>CAR CARE AUTO SPA was originally owned by the building's current Landlord location who sold the business to a person -- Let's call him Bob.  Due to ever rising, sky-high rent and unethical, illegal tactics (unbeknownst to us at the time), Bob sold the business to us.  </p>
<p>Well, we experienced more of the same, and we'd had enough!!!   We've bought the building across the street and are in the process of renovating and relocating.</p>
<p>Now, the Landlord and Bob have opened up another car wash at the old location, in violation of the business sales agreement, which has a non compete clause.</p>
<p>Landlord, Bob, and their cousins and friends are doing everything they can to stop us from opening our doors.  They call the City inspectors and police on a daily basis, sometimes impersonating other local businesses, wasting the City's resources on frivolous calls that still have to be investigated by law. </p>
<p>They've gone onto neighborhood Internet forums pretending to be ""concerned residents"".</p>
<p>They've complained to the Alderman, and then when they didn't get what they wanted, they went so far as to call WGN news, alleging the Alderman is corrupt!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>CAR CARE AUTO SPA needs funds badly!  We are asking for $50K or more, while to date we will be spending somewhere north of $500K for the building purchase and construction cost.</p>
<p>During construction, we are currently still doing details for the local dealerships for two reasons: 1) We want to maintain these valuable relationships and 2) I am trying to preserve the livelihood of my employees!</p>
<p>Since we are unable to do car washes during the build out, my employees  have dramtically reduced hours, and they do not have any tipping customers.  Under these circumstances, the weekly pay is not enough to provide a living wage, and so I am supplementing their pay out of my own pocket.  Thankfully, I have another source of income and some savings in order to be able to do that!!!</p>
<p>We are one team, loyal to each other.  As long as my guys are willing to stick with me, I will provide a livable wage for them, even if we are running in the red.  Your contribution will go towards that.</p>
<p>In general, the car wash industry is rife with inequities:</p>
<p><a href=""http://progressillinois.com/quick-hits/content/2012/09/24/study-shows-deplorable-conditions-wage-theft-chicago-car-wash-industry"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://progressillinois.com/quick-hits/content/2012/09/24/study-shows-deplorable-conditions-wage-theft-chicago-car-wash-industry</a></p>
<p>While CAR CARE AUTO SPA is nowhere close to the bleak conditions described in the article, I would like to run a gold standard business for others to emulate, and for customers to proudly support.  As is, my team knows they come first before profits -- I am uniquely able to take that position since I am fortunate enough not to depend solely on this business myself.</p>
<p>Near long term (i.e. 5 years), I would like to eliminate the largest overhead, which is the debt from building purchase and renovation.  This means more latitude for higher pay, more employees, reasonable hours etc. without needing to raise prices and pass that cost onto the customer.</p>
<p>Your contribution would go towards reduction of that overhead and accelerating the timeline.</p>
<p>Finally, as mentioned, the shady people across the street are in breach of contract.  Lowest of the priorities is taking legal action against them, with the end goal of achieving a financial award to go back towards the other priorities.  And getting justice!  =)</p>
<p>If there is enough funding, we will put that towards attorney fees.</p>
<h3><strong>What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>We're not all take and no give!!!  By helping CAR CARE AUTO SPA, you can get significant discounts or even free services.</p>
<ul>
<li>A $50 contribution will get 4 free washes*  - (a 30% savings)</li>
<li>A $100 contribution will get 10 free washes or one free detail**</li>
<li>A $500 contribution will get 50 free washes or five free details and lifetime discount card***</li>
<li>A $1,000 contribution will get free washes for a year for one vehicle  and lifetime discount card</li>
<li>A $5,000 contribution will get free washes AND details for two years for two vehicles  and lifetime discount card</li>
<li>A $10,000 contribution will get free washes AND details for life!</li>
</ul>
<p>* Free wash includes in and out wash and tire dressing</p>
<p>** Free detail consists of exterior buff/wax, interior shampoo/condition, engine steam cleaning</p>
<p>*** Lifetime discount card will entitle the holder for $3 off any wash, any time, and $20 off detail services.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contributions will change my life personally, change the lives and livelihood of our team, and create a model for the rest of the car wash industry to aspire to. </p>
<p>The business will be unique in both the service it provides to the community as one of the top tier car washes in the City, and hopefully this serves as a first step towards transforming the car wash industry as whole by providing fair and equitable opportunities for all of its workers.</p>
<p>And finally, this business will stand for karma and justice, an example against those who seek to do harm to others, and a demonstration that integrity, ethics and kindness are stronger and more valuable than greed.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Well, there is not a lot of risk here.  We own the building and construction is past the 50% mark.</p>
<p>The challenge is just the time it's going to take to get the business in a place financially to realize the big dreams.</p>
<p>I've been doing this for 3 years, staying in the black despite astronomical rent prices with a facility that left much to be desired.  With a mortgage that is 1/3 of the former rent, and a newly built, better designed, larger facility, in virtually the same locale, we're not anticipating big problems.</p>
<p>The sky could always fall and we could go out of business somehow, but the expectation is to be here sucessfully for a long time to come.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Please, whether you choose to contribute or not, share and spread the word!  The more people who know about our situation and hardships, the better!</p>
<p>And don't forget to use Indiegogo share tools!</p>
<p>I am happy to answer any questions.</p>

Well, we experienced more of the same, and we'd had enough!!!   We've bought the building across the street and are in the process of renovating and relocating.
Now, the Landlord and Bob have opened up another car wash at the old location, in violation of the business sales agreement, which has a non compete clause.
Landlord, Bob, and their cousins and friends are doing everything they can to stop us from opening our doors.  They call the City inspectors and police on a daily basis, sometimes impersonating other local businesses, wasting the City's resources on frivolous calls that still have to be investigated by law. 
They've gone onto neighborhood Internet forums pretending to be ""concerned residents"".
They've complained to the Alderman, and then when they didn't get what they wanted, they went so far as to call WGN news, alleging the Alderman is corrupt!

What We Need
CAR CARE AUTO SPA needs funds badly!  We are asking for $50K or more, while to date we will be spending somewhere north of $500K for the building purchase and construction cost.
During construction, we are currently still doing details for the local dealerships for two reasons: 1) We want to maintain these valuable relationships and 2) I am trying to preserve the livelihood of my employees!
Since we are unable to do car washes during the build out, my employees  have dramtically reduced hours, and they do not have any tipping customers.  Under these circumstances, the weekly pay is not enough to provide a living wage, and so I am supplementing their pay out of my own pocket.  Thankfully, I have another source of income and some savings in order to be able to do that!!!
We are one team, loyal to each other.  As long as my guys are willing to stick with me, I will provide a livable wage for them, even if we are running in the red.  Your contribution will go towards that.
In general, the car wash industry is rife with inequities:
http://progressillinois.com/quick-hits/content/2012/09/24/study-shows-deplorable-conditions-wage-theft-chicago-car-wash-industry
While CAR CARE AUTO SPA is nowhere close to the bleak conditions described in the article, I would like to run a gold standard business for others to emulate, and for customers to proudly support.  As is, my team knows they come first before profits -- I am uniquely able to take that position since I am fortunate enough not to depend solely on this business myself.
Near long term (i.e. 5 years), I would like to eliminate the largest overhead, which is the debt from building purchase and renovation.  This means more latitude for higher pay, more employees, reasonable hours etc. without needing to raise prices and pass that cost onto the customer.
Your contribution would go towards reduction of that overhead and accelerating the timeline.
Finally, as mentioned, the shady people across the street are in breach of contract.  Lowest of the priorities is taking legal action against them, with the end goal of achieving a financial award to go back towards the other priorities.  And getting justice!  =)
If there is enough funding, we will put that towards attorney fees.
What You Get
We're not all take and no give!!!  By helping CAR CARE AUTO SPA, you can get significant discounts or even free services.

A $50 contribution will get 4 free washes*  - (a 30% savings)
A $100 contribution will get 10 free washes or one free detail**
A $500 contribution will get 50 free washes or five free details and lifetime discount card***
A $1,000 contribution will get free washes for a year for one vehicle  and lifetime discount card
A $5,000 contribution will get free washes AND details for two years for two vehicles  and lifetime discount card
A $10,000 contribution will get free washes AND details for life!

* Free wash includes in and out wash and tire dressing
** Free detail consists of exterior buff/wax, interior shampoo/condition, engine steam cleaning
*** Lifetime discount card will entitle the holder for $3 off any wash, any time, and $20 off detail services.

The Impact
Your contributions will change my life personally, change the lives and livelihood of our team, and create a model for the rest of the car wash industry to aspire to. 
The business will be unique in both the service it provides to the community as one of the top tier car washes in the City, and hopefully this serves as a first step towards transforming the car wash industry as whole by providing fair and equitable opportunities for all of its workers.
And finally, this business will stand for karma and justice, an example against those who seek to do harm to others, and a demonstration that integrity, ethics and kindness are stronger and more valuable than greed.

Risks & Challenges
Well, there is not a lot of risk here.  We own the building and construction is past the 50% mark.
The challenge is just the time it's going to take to get the business in a place financially to realize the big dreams.
I've been doing this for 3 years, staying in the black despite astronomical rent prices with a facility that left much to be desired.  With a mortgage that is 1/3 of the former rent, and a newly built, better designed, larger facility, in virtually the same locale, we're not anticipating big problems.
The sky could always fall and we could go out of business somehow, but the expectation is to be here sucessfully for a long time to come.

Other Ways You Can Help
Please, whether you choose to contribute or not, share and spread the word!  The more people who know about our situation and hardships, the better!

I am happy to answer any questions.

<div align=""left""><b>Why Are We Seeking Your Financial
Help?</b></div>
</div>
<p>We are seeking funding to establish
an Urban Aquaponics Facility in a 6,000 square foot facility in a neighborhood called Three Points in the Historic Peacock Tract Community in Montgomery,
Alabama. The Peacock Tract encompassed parts of Downtown Montgomery, Cottage Hill, the Rosa Parks neighborhood, and Three Points.</p>
<p>Due to the safety/image perception of the
community, along with decades of lost roof tops within the first half-mile
demographic circle, a traditional redevelopment and financing model was not
feasible. To overcome this challenge, 5 Star Consortium began to take an
out-of-the-box approach to spark community revitalization by bringing
additional experience and expertise in project management, construction,
mixed-use development, and Aquaponics by adding PLC Development and Consulting,
Perez Architecture, and Con10u2farmL3C (A Social Impact Low Profit Company) to
the project team. This team, together with representatives of the City’s Community Development Division, developed a concept called “The Circle of Life
Initiative”.  This approach focuses on developing the Peacock Place
Community one component at a time while simultaneously providing job training,
employment, business creation, and promoting healthy lifestyles.<br/></p>
<p>These funds will also advance a Community-based program
called the “<b>Circle of Life Initiative”</b> which is a collaborative
partnership effort consisting of local, state, and national organizations and
agencies. It seeks to support local efforts to help low to moderate income
communities become vibrant, healthy, and self-sustaining through education and
economic empowerment.</p>

</div></div>","Why Are We Seeking Your Financial
Help?

We are seeking funding to establish
an Urban Aquaponics Facility in a 6,000 square foot facility in a neighborhood called Three Points in the Historic Peacock Tract Community in Montgomery,
Alabama. The Peacock Tract encompassed parts of Downtown Montgomery, Cottage Hill, the Rosa Parks neighborhood, and Three Points.
Due to the safety/image perception of the
community, along with decades of lost roof tops within the first half-mile
demographic circle, a traditional redevelopment and financing model was not
feasible. To overcome this challenge, 5 Star Consortium began to take an
out-of-the-box approach to spark community revitalization by bringing
additional experience and expertise in project management, construction,
mixed-use development, and Aquaponics by adding PLC Development and Consulting,
Perez Architecture, and Con10u2farmL3C (A Social Impact Low Profit Company) to
the project team. This team, together with representatives of the City’s Community Development Division, developed a concept called “The Circle of Life
Initiative”.  This approach focuses on developing the Peacock Place
Community one component at a time while simultaneously providing job training,
employment, business creation, and promoting healthy lifestyles.
These funds will also advance a Community-based program
called the “Circle of Life Initiative” which is a collaborative
partnership effort consisting of local, state, and national organizations and
agencies. It seeks to support local efforts to help low to moderate income
communities become vibrant, healthy, and self-sustaining through education and
economic empowerment.






Location of the Peacock Tract
Community in Montgomery, Alabama
The Historic Peacock
Tract Community is located approximately
½ Mile southwest from the core of downtown Montgomery, Alabama and the Alabama River, 1 mile
from the Capitol Complex, and 2 Miles from Maxwell Air Force Base. The community
is bound by Interstate 85 to the South, and Interstate 65 to the West.



The Historic Significance of the
Peacock Tract Community
1. Transportation Technology
Advancement



The Capitol City Street Railway, also
known as the Lightning Route,
which had established routes in April 1866 in the Peacock Tract Community, was
the first city-wide system of electric streetcars in Montgomery and the first in the
United States.


2. A Community
with Strong Institutions

Religion and education played a significant
role in the social development of the Peacock Tract Community. Mount Zion AME
Church was where Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was elected by the Montgomery Improvement
Association as leader of the Montgomery Bus Boycott Movement in 1955. Holt
Street Baptist Church played host to many of the mass public meetings for the
Montgomery Bus Boycott Movement. 
Loveless School was the academic center of the Peacock Tract Community
serving as the foundation for success for many of its graduates.  As of 2014, Loveless Academic Magnet Program
ranked as the top public magnet high school in the United States.
3. Two Major U.S. Social MovementsLed by Dr. Martin
Luther King, Jr., the Peacock Tract Community played host to two of our
nation’s greatest social and human rights movements.

The 1955
Montgomery Bus Boycott Movement
The fight to end segregated public transportation



The 1965 Selma to Montgomery National
Voting Rights March led to the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, a
landmark achievement of the 1960sAmerican Civil Rights Movement.


4.
Community with a Strong Economic Base From the 1950s to the 1970s, the
Peacock Tract Community had many types of businesses owned by various ethnic
groups, including dry cleaners, funeral homes, grocery and furniture stores,
drug stores, sweet shops, night clubs, radio stations, insurance companies, gas
stations, barber shops and beauty parlors.

grows in the backyard of every Filipino where the benefits of a diet rich in
Moringa are well known. It is traditionally used as a herbal medicine and for healing purposes.</p>

<p>Poverty and climate change are some
of the biggest challenges in the Philippines, particularly for the vulnerable
in rural areas. In November 2013 the super typhoon, Haiyan, hit the Philippines and affected
11 million people and destroyed 75% of the coconut trees in the Visayas region,
depriving millions of their main source of livelihood. The coconut sector
will take up to 10 years to restore, and that is simply too long a wait. We have started collaborations with 2 established local NGOs, <a href=""http://www.moringaling.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Moringaling Foundation Inc</a>. and <a href=""http://www.ecoweb.ph"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ecoweb</a>, to introduce Moringa as a real, immediate, and sustainable alternative. Together we will work to educate farmers in the cultivation of moringa, provide drying facilities, ensure the quality of the product, and assist in community development. With a successful launch, we expect during November 2015 to roll out projects for 9 communities and a total of 9,052 beneficiaries in the worst hit typhoon-affected areas.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1193198/files/20150203081209-IMG_9524_kopi.JPG?1422979929"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Moringa Tree is incredibly
resilient and is well suited for the hot, tropical climate of the Philippines.
The leaves are so nutritious that World Health Organization (WHO) has used
it for decades to fight malnutrition. Its seeds can be pressed into
oil for beauty products and the peel from the seeds can even be used for water
purification. It’s no wonder that this remarkable tree often goes by the name
“The Miracle Tree”.</span><br/></p>

<p>The past year we have been working
on building our business, testing the Moringa with chefs and at home, understanding
all food safety requirements and building networks in The Philippines, Denmark
and around Europe. In June 2014, we became the first winner of the 'Social
Enterprise' category at the <a href=""http://www.venturecup.dk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Venture Cup Denmark</span></a> start-up competition, which has given us mentorship and a network.
Moreover, in the fall of 2014, we were accepted at the incubator <a href=""http://cse.cbs.dk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Copenhagen School of Entrepreneurship</span></a> (CSE), providing us an office amongst a
number of passionate entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>We are ready to go to market!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1198368/files/20150205044019-money.png?1423140019"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Moringa leaves in the
Philippines are a beautiful deep green and are packed with taste and potent nutrients.
And that’s how we intend to keep it!  Bringing a new food product to the
market is expensive, especially when you care for preserving its natural
strength and ensuring it is responsible and safe along the way. </p>
<p>A successful campaign guarantees the
first production run of our beautifully crafted Roots Food Moringa ready for spring
2015. It also ensures that we kick-off our first livelihood projects for the
typhoon affected communities. We are almost there! Claim
yours early and support our ‘Eat Happy Be Happy’ mission.  <br/></p>

<p>An outfit isn’t complete without the perfect accessory! And, in
our opinion, the most striking accessories also have a story to tell. Why not
treat yourself, or a loved one, to a pretty pair of Moringa Leaf earrings from

We believe that food has the power to bring more happiness to the world. We’re talking about food that is natural, organic, healthy and delicious. Food that is ethically sourced and environmentally friendly. Food that gives back. We introduce to you one of the most powerful super food on the planet, Roots Food Moringa! 
Picture: Demo of our product and design

ATTENTION: You don't need PAYPAL to make a contribution - please view the bottom of this page for how to use credit/debit card, if you have challenges! Click here for instructions
Our Moringa is not just good for you, it’s good for the people who make it and it’s good for our planet! Now that's a super food!


       






Moringa is a green leafy tree that
grows in the backyard of every Filipino where the benefits of a diet rich in
Moringa are well known. It is traditionally used as a herbal medicine and for healing purposes.
The leaves of the tree are packed with nutrients and can provide a healthy energy boost because the leaves contain more than 96 nutrients including vitamins A, B and C, calcium, potassium, protein and many antioxidants and amino acids. Now that's just astonishing!

Vitamin Factory” by Dr. MarcuNational Cancer Institute Centre for Bioinformatics/Kevric Co. 
The world is picking it up. Help us get started and get it to you! ""Moringa Sales of this powder have soared in the past year. Lily Cole and Livia Firth are fans, partly because it contains skin-boosting vitamins such as A, C, E, riboflavin, niacin and zinc. Derived from the string-bean like pods of the moringa tree, it’s known as the “miracle tree” in its native Philippines, where women traditionally take it daily from the age of 12 upwards"" - The Times, Feb.28th 2015
READ MORE: http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/health/article4366546.ece


When the leaves
are dried they can be processed into powder or flakes, which increases the
concentration of nutrients and makes it easy to store so you always have a healthy
boost to your meal at hand. Its delicious leafy green flavour is subtle enough to
work with practically any dish or beverage.

you’re not only eating healthy, you’re also eating consciously because you’re
contributing to sustainable livelihoods for Filipino Moringa farmers in typhoon affected areas. So when you boost your meal with Roots Food Moringa, you’re also
boosting all that goodness into communities that need it the most!


In the Danish Magazine Iværksætteren (Entrepreneur) Read it (Danish)




Poverty and climate change are some
of the biggest challenges in the Philippines, particularly for the vulnerable
in rural areas. In November 2013 the super typhoon, Haiyan, hit the Philippines and affected
11 million people and destroyed 75% of the coconut trees in the Visayas region,
depriving millions of their main source of livelihood. The coconut sector
will take up to 10 years to restore, and that is simply too long a wait. We have started collaborations with 2 established local NGOs, Moringaling Foundation Inc. and Ecoweb, to introduce Moringa as a real, immediate, and sustainable alternative. Together we will work to educate farmers in the cultivation of moringa, provide drying facilities, ensure the quality of the product, and assist in community development. With a successful launch, we expect during November 2015 to roll out projects for 9 communities and a total of 9,052 beneficiaries in the worst hit typhoon-affected areas.

The Moringa Tree is incredibly
resilient and is well suited for the hot, tropical climate of the Philippines.
The leaves are so nutritious that World Health Organization (WHO) has used
it for decades to fight malnutrition. Its seeds can be pressed into
oil for beauty products and the peel from the seeds can even be used for water
purification. It’s no wonder that this remarkable tree often goes by the name
“The Miracle Tree”.

For us, this is just the beginning. Fighting malnutrition,
poverty and ensuring climate justice, are big challenges, but we
truly believe that we can make the right choices that make a lasting, positive
impact. 
Be a part
of our vision.



The past year we have been working
on building our business, testing the Moringa with chefs and at home, understanding
all food safety requirements and building networks in The Philippines, Denmark
and around Europe. In June 2014, we became the first winner of the 'Social
Enterprise' category at the Venture Cup Denmark start-up competition, which has given us mentorship and a network.
Moreover, in the fall of 2014, we were accepted at the incubator Copenhagen School of Entrepreneurship (CSE), providing us an office amongst a
number of passionate entrepreneurs.
We are ready to go to market!

The Moringa leaves in the
Philippines are a beautiful deep green and are packed with taste and potent nutrients.
And that’s how we intend to keep it!  Bringing a new food product to the
market is expensive, especially when you care for preserving its natural
strength and ensuring it is responsible and safe along the way. 
A successful campaign guarantees the
first production run of our beautifully crafted Roots Food Moringa ready for spring
2015. It also ensures that we kick-off our first livelihood projects for the
typhoon affected communities. We are almost there! Claim
yours early and support our ‘Eat Happy Be Happy’ mission.  
  
                                    


We’ve brought together our different backgrounds and common passion to start Roots Food as a social enterprise. Jackie is the power Social Entrepreneur of the team. Half-Filipina, born and raised in Denmark, she recently completed her Masters’ degree in Social Entrepreneurship from Copenhagen Business School and an internship with the Institute of Social Entrepreneurship in Asia in Manila. Daniel is a true global nomad, an experienced businessman with over 10 years in the financial services and with 4 years of business experience in the Philippines. Lisa, also half-Filipina and half-Danish, has several years of experience in the NGO sector in developing countries.

We decided to create a business that is a driving force for innovation, working with the principles of fair trade and sustainability.  Our goal is to run a business that empowers people – that strengthens communities in vulnerable parts of the Philippines and gives consumers in the West the choice of a healthy product that gives back.
Ultimately, we want to spread more happiness in this world. We call this our ‘Eat Happy, Be Happy!’ philosophy.

                     


We want to offer the very best of all super
foods for you to add on all kinds of food and drinks! We present Moringa in
flakes and powder – perfect for pasta, stews, smoothies and even as a tea! The
culinary and nutritional possibilities are endless!
However, to make this happen and to provide
you with this simple and awesome solution, we need YOUR support.
Help us make it easy for you to be healthy
and make and impact! To your right you can check out our range of options and
offers, including our pre-order Roots Food Moringa Flakes and Powder and fabulous
perks from collaborating artists. Scroll down to see our fun and unique offers from our artists.  






We have the
pleasure of introducing to you to talented artists that support Roots
Food!   







Music and chocolate – could you think
of a more uplifting combination? Add a sprinkle of Roots Food Moringa and you
have a whole lot of goodness going on! Get the Love is Love Moringa Chocolate bar
by Musical Chocolate, a social enterprise that supports musicians. This delicious treat has been named after the original song ""Love is Love"" by Danish-Filipino, ultra talented Eurovision sensation, Andy Roda. This set comes with a downloadable version of one of Andy's songs.






         











An outfit isn’t complete without the perfect accessory! And, in
our opinion, the most striking accessories also have a story to tell. Why not
treat yourself, or a loved one, to a pretty pair of Moringa Leaf earrings from
jewelry designer Trine Wagner. The earrings are handmade with a sterling silver-plated
lock and the best part about them is that when you’re asked where you got them
you’ll have a great story to tell!

</p><p>In an international survey, 85% of women with Internet access
stated that it provides “more freedom.”<b> That is what we hope to achieve for
women in our hometown of Gilgit, Pakistan by offering
free Internet access at the All Women Net Cafe.  </b></p><p></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>//ABOUT US</b></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We are a team of women, currently living and studying in the United States, working towards enhancing the daily lives of women in our hometown of Gilgit, Pakistan. We have experienced being cut off from Internet access in the area, and the frustration of being unable to fill out a college application, find out information for an assignment, or send an important email due to a lack of Internet access. We firmly believe that access to the Internet is an important right for women to have. </span></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>//THE PROBLEM</b></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">In Pakistan, only about 1/10 of the population uses the Internet. Though this is a relatively high number with respect to other South Asian countries, there is a clear rift between access in urban versus rural areas – 17.4% of urban homes have access to internet as compared to a mere<b> 1.3% of rural homes</b>. This disparity is compounded further by socio-economic inequality and gender disparity that</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> is clearly translated into the digital arena, leaving rural women the most isolated from internet access in the country. This unequal online representation is a reflection of the great gender disparity prominent in Pakistan, where social barriers restrict women from mobility in the public space, limiting opportunities for education, employment or general autonomy of movement.  </span><br/></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p><b><br/>//OUR MISSION</b></p>
<p>Our mission is to provide the women of Gilgit with a safe and productive environment where they have free access to the Internet. We want to create a space where women are able to be productive and feel comfortable while utilizing the Internet for their education, career or networking. This Internet Cafe will not only motivate women and girls to learn technical skills, but also help them to apply it to their personal goals and endeavors. The All Women Net Cafe is a new concept in Gilgit, Pakistan, but it is important for this café to be exclusively for women as existing Internet cafes are typically dominated by men and are deemed unsafe or improper places for girls and women. At our net cafe, every woman will be welcome despite her class, age or familiarity with technology. The cafe will be entirely operated by women, contributing to the local economy and providing opportunities for employment and job experience for local women. </p>

Internet access is becoming crucial in a more connected world due to its unique ability to break down barriers of distance, and allow people to instantly exchange information and ideas that can transform their ways of life.

</div>","//FOLLOW US l CONTACT USGmail: AllWomenNetCafe@gmail.com Twitter: @AllWomenNetCafeFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/AllWomenNetCafe//THE CAMPAIGN
In an international survey, 85% of women with Internet access
stated that it provides “more freedom.” That is what we hope to achieve for
women in our hometown of Gilgit, Pakistan by offering
free Internet access at the All Women Net Cafe.  //ABOUT USWe are a team of women, currently living and studying in the United States, working towards enhancing the daily lives of women in our hometown of Gilgit, Pakistan. We have experienced being cut off from Internet access in the area, and the frustration of being unable to fill out a college application, find out information for an assignment, or send an important email due to a lack of Internet access. We firmly believe that access to the Internet is an important right for women to have. //THE PROBLEMIn Pakistan, only about 1/10 of the population uses the Internet. Though this is a relatively high number with respect to other South Asian countries, there is a clear rift between access in urban versus rural areas – 17.4% of urban homes have access to internet as compared to a mere 1.3% of rural homes. This disparity is compounded further by socio-economic inequality and gender disparity that is clearly translated into the digital arena, leaving rural women the most isolated from internet access in the country. This unequal online representation is a reflection of the great gender disparity prominent in Pakistan, where social barriers restrict women from mobility in the public space, limiting opportunities for education, employment or general autonomy of movement.  //OUR MISSION
Our mission is to provide the women of Gilgit with a safe and productive environment where they have free access to the Internet. We want to create a space where women are able to be productive and feel comfortable while utilizing the Internet for their education, career or networking. This Internet Cafe will not only motivate women and girls to learn technical skills, but also help them to apply it to their personal goals and endeavors. The All Women Net Cafe is a new concept in Gilgit, Pakistan, but it is important for this café to be exclusively for women as existing Internet cafes are typically dominated by men and are deemed unsafe or improper places for girls and women. At our net cafe, every woman will be welcome despite her class, age or familiarity with technology. The cafe will be entirely operated by women, contributing to the local economy and providing opportunities for employment and job experience for local women. 

//INTERNET IN THE 21ST CENTURYThe disparity of being disconnected from the Internet is most stark in the developing world, where only 32% of the population has access. The link between Internet access and individual and community development is most starkly proven by the fact that “the offline population is disproportionately rural, low income, illiterate, elderly and female”. Internet access is becoming crucial in a more connected world due to its unique ability to break down barriers of distance, and allow people to instantly exchange information and ideas that can transform their ways of life. In this way, it empowers individuals to be aware of, and exercise, their civil liberties and participate in the social, economic and political development of their countries, and the world at large.
//THE BUDGETOur total
budget is $10,000 for the startup costs of the Internet
Cafe: 
($1 = 101.83 Pakistani Rupees)** Absolutely
100% of the funds raised will go towards the Internet café itself. No funding
will go towards our personal expenses associated with travel or stay in
Pakistan. Any additional funds raised will go towards the development and
expansion of the Cafe through the purchase of additional laptops, training and
tutorials, building upgrades, etc. **//TIMELINESummer 2015: A team representative will be going to Gilgit, Pakistan in order to finalize the budget, and locate a site for the net cafe. Winter 2015: The team will be going to Gilgit to furnish the cafe, get the computers and networks setup and working, and have all operations running! Summer Break 2016: The project will be expanded to include training and classes at the net cafe, increase the number of computers available, and implement relevant building upgrades.              //OTHER WAYS TO HELPIt is

It has been tested and proven successful throughout the centuries. We, my wife and I, want to buy distressed properties, fix them up, and then hold on to them as rental units for passive income. That's it, but that has very little to do with the real project. Money after all is just a means to an end. </p>
<p>
I am a professional, PMP certified, project manager. Unfortunately almost all of my projects have either had such a long commute as to leave me utterly exhausted at the end of the day or, like now,have  been out of town meaning I only see my family on the weekends. I find that I am not home enough to have the strong relationships and provide the consistency my family needs.  Someday my situation will change, and some day I will have time, but someday it will be too late and my boys will be men.  The real project is to grow my wonderful boys (ages 6, 4 and 0 in June) into superb men.</p> </div>
<div> <h3>Background and Method</h3>
<p>As I mention above, I am a professional project manager.  In other words, I am a Project Management Hammer and I tend to see things a Project Nails. On a daily bases I acquire a solid, but some what general understanding of my project components and then leverage professions with deeper and more specific knowledge than I to complete the the individual tasks. In general I usually have the best overall understanding of the project, but for any specific component, there is a professional on my team more knowledgeable than I on that one thing. I plan to do the same with this project. The basic steps are as follows:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Use a hard money loan to purchase a distressed property at 70% after repair value minus repairs. </li>
<li>Fix the home up to good, rentable condition.</li>
<li>Rent out the property.</li>
<li>Refinance with a bank for 80% of its new value. This should recuperate most of the closing, carrying, financing, and refinancing costs.</li>
<li>Rinse and repeat.  All rental income and an additional 20% of my income will be put into building more equity.  To goal being to eventually cut out the hard money lenders and then the banks.</li>
<li>Once net rental income is sufficient to replace my wages, become a full time Supper Dad, instead of just a weekend one as I am now.</li>
</ol>
<div>Once I am able to replace my income, my full time plan for my boys will be as follows:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Fall through spring</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Drop my sons off at school every morning and pick them up every afternoon</li>
<li>Help them with their studies after school</li>
<li>Play and spend time with them while they are young and still want to play with their dad.</li>
<li>Agree as a family on a large project that will take about 9 months to complete working together in the evenings and on Saturdays.  The purpose is to give us a common goal to
work towards where everyone can play a role and have a responsibility. This could be anything from building a boat to doing the work ourselves on one of the investment properties.</li>
<li>Learn a language together as a family that we will use in the summer.</li>
</ul>
<li>Summer</li>
<ul>
<li>Travel and explore.  Spend the summer in Thailand visiting grandparents, in Japan visiting cousins, or in Scotland seeing where our family is from.  The idea is to stay in one place long enough to gain an appreciation for the people, culture, values, and beliefs. Then again we might drive across the country in an RV we fixed up the previous year.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div><div> <p></p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>We are committed to this plan. For over the past two year we have been saving 20% of my income and we will succeed, but this campaign and associated project will have huge impacts in two areas.</p>
<p>First, entirely funding the project through our own savings and a combination of hard money and bank loans will take about 11 years 11 months.  Just in time for our first son to leave.<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>$30,000 raised: Start immediately and Finish 7 months faster.<br/>
</li>
<li>$100,000 raised: Avoid the Hard money lenders, work only with the banks, and finish  in 10 years 2 months, 1 year and 9 months faster.</li>
<li>$500,000 Raised: Almost completely avoid the banks.  Finish as fast as we can find, renovate, and rent properties that meet our criteria.</li> <li>$1,000,000 Raised:  We can completely avoid the hard money lenders and the banks and I can immediately focus full time on being a Real Estate Super Dad!</li> </ul>
<div>Second, I, and therefore my family, gets to escape the rat race and spend time with each other while the children are small.  I will do my best to be a good role model as husband who loves his wife and a father who loves his children.</div> </div> <div>
<h3>Risks   Challenges</h3>
<p>While there are always risks, we will be using several strategies to mitigate, or lessen both the probability and potential harm including the following.</p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Because we are buying and holding we will be making income off of rent.  If therefore we end up over paying a little on the property or the repairs turn out to be more than expected, our rate of return will be decreased, but we will still have the income stream.  </li>
<ul>
<li>Elements of appreciation or depreciation (whether forced or over time) are not as impactfull. </li>
<li>Slight cost overruns are not as damaging.</li>
</ul>
<li>Adequate property and mortgage insurance will help to cover against suit and desaster.</li>
<li>Structuring properties in LLCs will protect against outside and inside legal attacks.</li>
<li>Use of qualified professionals will help to avoid any missteps.  These professionals include but are not limited to:</li>
<ul>
<li>Licensed and bonded contractors (carpenters, plumbers, and electricians).</li>
<li>Real Estate agents experienced in our type of income property.</li>
<li>Property managers knowledgeable in our chosen area.</li>
<li>Tax accountants and book keeper specializing in real estate.</li>
<li>Property inspectors.</li>
<li>Landscaping professionals.</li>
</ul>
<li>Multiple smaller properties instead of fewer larger ones to spread risk.</li>
</ul>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Finally, this is an instance where a sharp knife is safer than a dull one.  So the more capital we are able to acquire, the more protected we will be from a single bad deal early on.</span>
<p></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Any amount will help us get closer to our goals, but whether or not you feel you can contribute financially please help us gain exposure:</p> <ul> <li>Vote for us above.</li> <li>Help us share our story using the tools on the left!</li>

To help with taxes, all donors will receive an email at the end of each year detailing how much was donated to each supported non-profit.  We are not looking to build an empire, we have simply created a way to get money into the hands of those who can really make an impact in this world.Throughout the development of KiwiTree we have made an effort to keep everything as simple and user-friendly as possible, that's why users are able to turn on, turn off, and set limits to the service whenever needed from anywhere with internet access.  No contacting customer support to make changes, no waiting to cancel service, no pulling out your hair trying to do anything that should take the simple click of a button.What are the funds for?The development of the service itself is nearing completion.  As we are working with donations made to non-profits and charities, our income from the project is minimal.  As development of the system is nearly complete, the money earned through this fundraising campaign will be used for server space to process the user’s micro donations, additional security of our users’ information, improving site's aesthetic appeal, and marketing materials to expand the KiwiTree network of non-profits and charities as wide as possible. The Kiwi KingdomHere at KiwiTree we like to think of our users and supporters as more than family, that's why we have created the Kiwi Kingdom.  As you may have noticed, many of the donation rewards include a role in the kingdom (from ""Knight"" to ""Royalty"") which will show everyone on kiwitree.com how important your contribution is to us.  We have also reserved the position of ""Kiwi King"" which will be given to the highest contributor during our IndieGoGo campaign.  The top donor will be the only person at this contribution level and cannot be dethroned.  All hail the future king! Risks and challengesCurrently, this electronic “round-up” funding method does not exist for charities and non-profits, and, as with many trail blazing ideas, there are potential hang ups. Although we do not foresee any issues with the development of KiwiTree, or with the fulfillment of our donation rewards, we ask for your patience if any hiccups occur.Unfortunately, due to the difference in laws governing charities throughout the world, KiwiTree will only be able to support charities and non-profits which are based in the United States. We are eager to extend the benefits of KiwiTree’s “round-up” funding world-wide, but for now not all non-profits will be eligible for our services.Also, as we want to insure that all donations actually end up in the hands of the cause they are intended for, KiwiTree users will only be able to donate to pre-approved organizations that have been verified by KiwiTree. The list of verified organizations will grow with us over time, but we ask for your patience and continued support in the case of your favorite organization not yet being approved.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Silicon Valley, the nickname given to the home of some many
of the world's largest technology corporations, as well as thousands of tech
startup companies. A place where students, potential (and experienced)
entrepreneurs, and investors all flock to. A place that has become synonymous
with innovation, startups and breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1135823/files/20150107010534-Firmen_im_Silicon_Valley.jpg?1420621534"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p><br/>
<p>
</p><p>Why can’t we have a city like this in Australia? Why isn’t
any Australian city known for its technology, innovation or startups? One of
the biggest reasons is that university (and Tafe) students are not actively
encouraged to pursue ideas, dreams and ambitions. This is what Project
AussieVation (Australian Innovation) is all about<i>; <b>encouraging Australians (starting
with university students) to innovate, design and advance society.</b> </i></p>
<p>Let’s take a look at one famous university in Silicon Valley,
Stanford University; “During the 1940s and 1950s (when Silicone Valley started
becoming known for being a tech hub), Frederick Terman, as Stanford's dean of
engineering and provost, encouraged faculty and graduates to start their own
companies. He is credited with nurturing Hewlett-Packard, Varian Associates,
and other high-tech firms, until what would become Silicon Valley grew up
around the Stanford campus. Terman is often called ""the father of Silicon
Valley""” (taken from Wikipedia.org). </p>

<p>It is often said that children, teenagers, and young adults
are tomorrow’s future. But, by not empowering them with the correct skills and
equally as important, giving them encouragement, young adults will continue to
follow society’s “default” route (ie. Finish high school, go to university or learn
a trade, find a partner and perhaps get children, work until retirement, and
then retire), not having made society and the world a better place. The goal is
not to pick on or insult those that choose to live the non-entrepreneurial
lifestyle, but rather, due to a lack of the required skills/tools and
encouragement, many would-be entrepreneurs “play it safe” and choose to work a
9-5 job instead of trying out their idea. Imagine if more Australians tried designing
new technology, or a renewable source of energy to fuel cars sustainably, who
knows where we could have taken the world…</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Who are we?</b></p>
<p>We are a small group of university students from Perth that would like
to make Australia a nation like the US, UK, Germany or South Korea(etc), famous for
technology, medicine, automobiles, biotechnology, etc.</p>
<p>My course of study is a Bachelor of Engineering (Civil and
Structural)/ Bachelor of Commerce double degree. </p>
<p>This initiative is not to make money. However, it is NOT a
not-for-profit. Whilst we are considering registering it as a not-for-profit,
registering it as one makes it more difficult to obtain funding (from
investors). This would seriously limit expansion of the initiative into other
states. Ideally, the initiative will be registered as a company. This would be
the easiest business structure to deal with, especially if we are to receive
funding and sponsorship from the government and other investors.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>What do we
plan on doing?</b></p>
<p>Initially, our plan is to target one area, and one market
within that area. The proposed area that we’ll be kicking off in is Perth and
the target market will be university students. We plan on hosting events and/or
stands at university Orientation Days (ie. O-Days), pitching to students at university
Career Days (ie. Where various companies go to inform students about their
organisations), put up flyers around campus and lastly, hold small workshops
within university libraries. After we manage to get our message across to
university students, we’ll be rolling out to various TAFEs and high schools.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the plan is to launch on the East Coast (Sydney,
Melbourne, and Brisbane) and thereafter other Australian cities (eg. Adelaide,
etc).</p><p>Ideally, students will have ties to both the US and China: The US can provide a significant headstart in terms of research and development  for students as they are at the forefront of technologicfal innovation, and China, to produce prototypes and harness the manufacturing might of China.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1135851/files/20150107013925-Entrepren_LC_class09_3954.jpg?1420623565"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

<p><strong>Imagine
being abused in a relationship and having no money to leave a bad
situation.  Domestic Violence victims can now take steps to
strengthen their finance.</strong>
</p>
<p>One morning this woman woke up with a cane hitting her face repeatedly by her husband.  Her husband was mad because they had bills.  Her face was beaten beyond recognition.  She left and returned to her husband one week later because she had no money.  That person was my ""sister"".  My sister did not report it to the police, she was shame and did not want anyone to know about her situation.  She stayed at my mother house for one week, and her husband told her that he would not do it again and that he was sorry. Many people are in this situation.</p>

<p>Did you know,
financial factors are the strongest predictors in a survivor's
decision to stay, leave, or return to an abusive relationship. The
devastation of leaving behind a home, income, benefits and economic
security are challenges that all survivors of domestic violence must
overcome, regardless of their education, job skills and personal
earning potential. Many survivors of domestic violence have limited
or no access to money or have had their financial security destroyed
by their abuser.  <b>In fact we want to try to education the survivor by
giving them <i>their own internet business that can pursued with their

<p><br/></p></div>","Imagine
being abused in a relationship and having no money to leave a bad
situation.  Domestic Violence victims can now take steps to
strengthen their finance.

One morning this woman woke up with a cane hitting her face repeatedly by her husband.  Her husband was mad because they had bills.  Her face was beaten beyond recognition.  She left and returned to her husband one week later because she had no money.  That person was my ""sister"".  My sister did not report it to the police, she was shame and did not want anyone to know about her situation.  She stayed at my mother house for one week, and her husband told her that he would not do it again and that he was sorry. Many people are in this situation.


Did you know,
financial factors are the strongest predictors in a survivor's
decision to stay, leave, or return to an abusive relationship. The
devastation of leaving behind a home, income, benefits and economic
security are challenges that all survivors of domestic violence must
overcome, regardless of their education, job skills and personal
earning potential. Many survivors of domestic violence have limited
or no access to money or have had their financial security destroyed
by their abuser.  In fact we want to try to education the survivor by
giving them their own internet business that can pursued with their
passion. 

   What the survivors will expect:                                                                        



  The domestic violence survivors may only have a cell phone and they can build their business via the cell phone and they will not need a computer to build the business. 

The domestic violence survivors are not feeling secure financially, but with a website, they can start dreaming again and hoping, having faith and getting secured financially.No sense of value, feel worthless, but by having their own business, they can add value and start building their self esteem.       
 

A Domestic Violence Victim Can Have Less Worry If;
They have a business idea and they have no way of pursuing that idea, Imanij can help.They can have income that will support them when they leave home.
They are usually afraid of the world because of the finance, Imanij will give them hope regarding finance.
Many domestic violence survivors reported they have lost jobs due to domestic violence and our solution is offering them to start their own business.Women experiences unemployment and are welfare recipients, now they can become self employed.  Lack of money and steady income is often challenge faced by a survivor of domestic violence when they leave the abuser.  Having an internet business will give them possibility of having income.

<p><strong>Who are you ? </strong></p>
<p>I’m Arin Panait, I’m 52, I leave in a small town in Romania, Fetesti. I could describe myself as “a passionate hobbyist”. I have done a lot of things and there were a lot of domains I was interested into. </p>
<p>I’ve started tinkering in my childhood with DIY construction machinery toys made of wood and wire, I’ve done lot of fretwork (some photos on my blog - <a href=""http://arin.panait.net/?s=trasuri"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://arin.panait.net/?s=trasuri</a>), I’ve built a model railroad diorama as large as my living room (<a href=""http://trenulete.info/orasul-din-sufragerie-prin-lentila-unui-ziarist-la-adevarul"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://trenulete.info/orasul-din-sufragerie-prin-lentila-unui-ziarist-la-adevarul</a>), and for the last few years my passion is to build custom model cars. I have built lot of models, both from scratch and by customizing off-the-shelf models (a Romanian Postal Service car<a href=""http://http://arin.panait.net/dacia-1304-posta-romana/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> http://arin.panait.net/dacia-1304-posta-romana/</a> or the car of ex-dictator Ceausescu - <a href=""http://arin.panait.net/aro-306-ma%C8%99ina-decapotabila-a-lui-ceau%C8%99escu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://arin.panait.net/aro-306-ma%C8%99ina-decapotabila-a-lui-ceau%C8%99escu</a>).</p>
<p>Last year I’ve first seen a 3D printer, with the help of a friend. It was like a new universe has opened for in front of my eyes. I’ve been fortunate to have friends who helped me use the new technology and helped me with creating 3D models. This way an old dream of mine came true : modelling of the old Bucegi Romanian truck. </p>
<p><br/><strong>What is “Bucegi”, why and how are you modelling it ?</strong></p>
<p>Bucegi is an old Romanian truck brand that have been produced in Romania 40-50 years ago. I drove one when I was younger and it was love at first sight. Around 25-30 different trucks have been produced in Romania, all on the same Bucegi platform (lorry, tractor truck, gasoline tanker, garbage truck, milk tanker, fire truck, refrigerated truck, timber lorry and others).</p>
<p>Years ago, playing Microsoft Train Simulator, I have modelled the trucks as 3D digital models for the software.  I’ve tried many times to replicate real models with resin and stuff, but nothing satisfactory until I’ve start using the 3D printing technology.</p>
<p>As I said, 3D printing has opened a new universe for me. Converting the cabin from Microsoft Train Simulator to STL for 3D printing was the first step I did (<a href=""http://arin.panait.net/bucegi-pregatiri/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://arin.panait.net/bucegi-pregatiri/</a>). One year later, with help from my friends, many trucks were ready (see the pages on the blog - <a href=""http://arin.panait.net/page/4/?s=bucegi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://arin.panait.net/page/4/?s=bucegi</a>). Three of the trucks are completely 3D printable, all the elements have been modelled and printed. For the rest of the trucks you see on the blog, it’s actually a combination between 3D printing and building from scratch from other materials.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why have you started this campaign ?</strong></p>
<p>What I want is to share with people the results of my work. I really think it’s nice for the youth to have the chance to connect with the technology of the past. As soon as I have enough trucks to display, I want to create  a small museum for everyone to learn about the old technology.</p>
<p>This is a goal I see in the future, for now I have to focus on modelling and printing. That’s actually the role of the campaign. To allow me to focus on 3D modelling and printing until I have enough models ready to be displayed. I have three models ready to be printed (the ones I’m offering in the campaign),  and I still have about 20 trucks to modelled and printed. </p>
<p><br/><strong>I’ve seen all the perks on your campaign are the same, no matter the contribution. Why ?</strong><br/> </p>
<p>That is correct, all the perks are the same, no matter the contribution. Although the Indiegogo platform is mainly used by startups and businesses, I do not see my Indiegogo campaign as a business. If I wanted to make money, I would have sold the models on Shapeways or similar for a fixed price. However, I only need a way to focus on designing new stuff for 3D printing and later creating my museum, and nothing more. It’s up to you to decide how much value and happiness my models bring to you and contribute accordingly on the campaign.<br/> </p>

<p><b>Parcel#1 w/business</b> “<i>2 homes, pool and stables on 3.5
wooded acres, ideal for Bed &amp; Breakfast. </i><i>If
you are looking for room to roam and need to spread your wings then this is the
property for you. This unique property consists of a 4br/2ba home along with a
detached 2bd/1ba cottage which can easily be converted into a 3bd cottage all
situated on 1 acre of pristine land in a prime location. Current owners have
this property setup as an income producing business which is consistently booked throughout the year by new and
returning customers. This income producing property allows the next buyer to
walk into a turnkey operation with solid financials and includes all
appliances, furniture, linens, dishes, and cups. Both the home and cottage are
serviced by two separate septic systems. Cooks kitchen is exceptionally large
and offers lots of storage. Both homes come furnished.” $575,000,000</i></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>This
will be my (the Innkeeper’s) living Quarters…</b></p>
<p><b>Parcel#2</b> “<i>Fully restored </i><i>Historic
Victorian parsonage, circa 1880s. 3 bedrooms, 1.5 baths, two fireplaces - one
in parlor, one in upstairs bedroom - plus cozy den with woodstove, formal
living, dining rooms. Woodsy setting with another gazebo on one acre adjoining
other properties. Small detached garage, plus 400-square-foot air conditioned
workshop with electric, plumbing and its own brand new 3-bedroom septic system.</i></p>
<p><b>Additional remarks from the owner regarding the natural environment of the place:</b></p>
<p> <i>“We already have a good start on butterflies and pollinators here. We’ve never used chemicals of any kind on our property in the 14 or 15 years we’ve owned it, and have a huge variety of butterflies as a result. Each year we are visited by a huge colony of bees that suddenly arrive and take up temporary residence in a hollowed out oak tree. They arrive in a great cloud; use the tree as a rest stop for a couple of weeks, then go on their way -- to where we just don't know. We're also very protective of our raptors -- many generations of barred owls and hawks that nest in our grandfather oaks every winter. I've been an environmental reporter for more than 20 years and the current global risk to the monarchs and pollinators is profound, so your mission is an important one.</i></p>
<p><i>Our concern for what might happen to these lovely parcels is why we haven't tried very hard to sell them. We're very conflicted about it and haven't wanted to let go. I've always felt that the universe would somehow bring the right person to entrust with its stewardship and I feel strongly that person might be you. I can't think of anyone more right for this property -- not only because of your conservation intentions with the monarchs, but because it is the perfect place to indulge your daughter's passion for horses. At the same time, it offers a solid foundation with an established income stream to build on, which is critical to your plans. The vacation rental business provides a steady, stable income that far exceeds any that a B&amp;B (bed and breakfast) could produce, allowing you the space and light to build a tea room business.”</i></p>
<p>The present owners  have already offered to make a few exceptions and adjustments in reference to me
obtaining the compound in its entirety. They are really rooting for me to steward their special property.</p>
<p>Joining me to
live in the Parcel#2 home will be my youngest daughter, who just turned 9. A bright, ever-caring and helpful sprite. She is an animal lover with a particular affinity for horses and
wolves. She has her heart set on working with animals and being of service as
an animal communicator/healer, perhaps by way of an occupation as a
Veterinarian.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>My relevant experience:</b></p>
<p>I presently work at a Non-Profit, Spiritual Retreat Center here
in SW, FL. I am the Administrative Assistant/Admin (with 6 years experience in
this area). I assist the Director and perform task as a Reservationist,
Innkeeper and set-up for Programs/Events and Facility Use. I handle all guest
and social correspondence, social media, create brochures, flyer designs and
the Newsletters and Periodicals. I coordinate our volunteers and handle
registrations for programs and events. I’m responsible for collecting and
recording incoming funds (including cash donations). I generate end of month
statistics/reports from reservations, programs and spiritual direction, as well
as maintain and update the website. </p>
<p><strong>I'm certified and registered with <a href=""http://www.monarchwatch.org/waystations/registry/detail.php?id=3896"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://monarchwatch.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Monarchwatch.org</a> and the National Wildlife Federation, as featured in <a href=""http://www.gulfshorelife.com/February-2011/Environmental-Lifesavers/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gulfshore Life Magazine</a>.

<p><br/></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><b><b>Down to business ... Where are the funds going?</b></b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>The funds will be used as a down payment
to purchase the business/properties and all business licenses, fees and such.** The funds will also go to the installing the various butterfly/flower gardens for the pollinators.</p>
<p><b>**</b>If
it is not enough to secure a mortgage on the property sited in this campaign, I
will then look to a few other properties/options I have in the wings. There is
a property in Oviedo, FL and one just north of Ocala, FL that are of workable
interest.</p>
<p><b>**</b>If the contributions are
less than workable to secure said property or the properties mentioned above, I will use the contributions as a
base foundation to continue supporting my vision from there. </p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Other
avenues of support…</b></h3>
<p>I have a close connection with someone
who has offered to assist me, with the anticipation of securing some additional
financial support through an  ‘Angel investor’.                    </p>
<p>I’ve been in the process of letting go of many of my late dad’s valuables, some furnishings, collectibles and a slew of other unique items that I inherited. They are not my style and it’s time to let these things go to someone seeks them. The funds received from the sale of these items will also go to the endeavors of this campaign.<br/></p>

<h3><b>Risk
and challenges</b></h3>
<p>If I were starting a NEW business, I believe marketing would
be my biggest challenge. However, the present business is already known with
well established repeat guests. Both homes on parcel#1 are rented 90%+,
yearly; with bookings a year and a half out. What I bring will simply be icing
on the cake. Our guests and future tea room visitors can see and directly experience
the benefit of what their patronage supports. Would anyone really need additional reasons to retreat in such a place, or come in for a spot of tea?  <b>   </b></p>

Bonus!</b> The present owner is a “horse lover from birth”…her words.
She owns 6 horses of her own and is ecstatic about my daughter Naomi’s, mutual
love for horses. For a minimal lease she has offered us full use of the
additional 1.5 acre land with a barn so that Naomi may have that for her future
horse and to preserve the raptors habitats on that land.</p>

Hello, Everyone.
I raise and release butterflies. Specifically Monarchs, but other winged species too. I was prompted to begin butterfly gardening by the passing of my father (you can read about that piece here). During this time, I experienced 4 years of persistent reoccurring dreams/visions. They began roughly, 6 and a ½ years ago. For 3 out of those 4 years I had no idea what the dreams meant.
What shifted? I began to align myself with my passions, the dream-visions became clearer and as that happened, parts of these dreams began weaving into my waking life. I began to recognize opportunities and steps I could take to make the dream a reality. The most significant clarity of my dreams was revealed when I began feeling and seeing myself engaged in occupations that came naturally to me with ease, grace and most importantly, Joy. Bottom line, the dream-visions were a calling for Nature and environmental stewardship and community. I “answered the call”, so to speak, and ultimately I feel this is not just MY dream, but a collective dream being facilitated and expressed through me. Hubs woven into our communities, cities and towns that place conscious emphasis on supporting natural havens, waystations and ecosystems, are essential to reestablish and maintain our balance with Nature. I see these hubs as gateways to elevate public environmental awareness, connecting us to the value of All living things and consciously reinforcing these standards until it becomes a natural occurrence in our everyday lives. 
This has all brought me face-to-face with my dream of running Monarch Manor Retreats on the business-property you will read about below. In addition, I’ve also had a longstanding daytime-dream of hosting a Tea Room. All the amenities are already in place to facilitate it in the historical home on the property, and local zoning will allow it. If feasible - a tea room will be offered in the near future.

Now, on to this delicious property/business
Present owner’s description:


“An oasis of
tranquility in a suburb of urban Tampa. Central to beaches, Disney, Busch
Gardens, outlet malls and antique districts. Walk to Starbucks or drive a few
minutes to golf, tennis, horse and canoe rentals. It is the perfect place for
R&R or to combine business and pleasure. Unlike other strictly
tourist-oriented destinations, the Tampa Bay Area is prime for both vacation
lodging as well as corporate short-term assignments and house-hunting for
relocation. The three homes on the estate offer a great deal of flexibility for
use and room for expansion.”


Parcel#1 w/business “2 homes, pool and stables on 3.5
wooded acres, ideal for Bed & Breakfast. If
you are looking for room to roam and need to spread your wings then this is the
property for you. This unique property consists of a 4br/2ba home along with a
detached 2bd/1ba cottage which can easily be converted into a 3bd cottage all

this property setup as an income producing business which is consistently booked throughout the year by new and
returning customers. This income producing property allows the next buyer to
walk into a turnkey operation with solid financials and includes all
appliances, furniture, linens, dishes, and cups. Both the home and cottage are
serviced by two separate septic systems. Cooks kitchen is exceptionally large
and offers lots of storage. Both homes come furnished.” $575,000,000

This
will be my (the Innkeeper’s) living Quarters…
Parcel#2 “Fully restored Historic
Victorian parsonage, circa 1880s. 3 bedrooms, 1.5 baths, two fireplaces - one
in parlor, one in upstairs bedroom - plus cozy den with woodstove, formal
living, dining rooms. Woodsy setting with another gazebo on one acre adjoining
other properties. Small detached garage, plus 400-square-foot air conditioned
workshop with electric, plumbing and its own brand new 3-bedroom septic system.
Additional remarks from the owner regarding the natural environment of the place:
 “We already have a good start on butterflies and pollinators here. We’ve never used chemicals of any kind on our property in the 14 or 15 years we’ve owned it, and have a huge variety of butterflies as a result. Each year we are visited by a huge colony of bees that suddenly arrive and take up temporary residence in a hollowed out oak tree. They arrive in a great cloud; use the tree as a rest stop for a couple of weeks, then go on their way -- to where we just don't know. We're also very protective of our raptors -- many generations of barred owls and hawks that nest in our grandfather oaks every winter. I've been an environmental reporter for more than 20 years and the current global risk to the monarchs and pollinators is profound, so your mission is an important one.
Our concern for what might happen to these lovely parcels is why we haven't tried very hard to sell them. We're very conflicted about it and haven't wanted to let go. I've always felt that the universe would somehow bring the right person to entrust with its stewardship and I feel strongly that person might be you. I can't think of anyone more right for this property -- not only because of your conservation intentions with the monarchs, but because it is the perfect place to indulge your daughter's passion for horses. At the same time, it offers a solid foundation with an established income stream to build on, which is critical to your plans. The vacation rental business provides a steady, stable income that far exceeds any that a B&B (bed and breakfast) could produce, allowing you the space and light to build a tea room business.”
The present owners  have already offered to make a few exceptions and adjustments in reference to me
obtaining the compound in its entirety. They are really rooting for me to steward their special property.
Joining me to
live in the Parcel#2 home will be my youngest daughter, who just turned 9. A bright, ever-caring and helpful sprite. She is an animal lover with a particular affinity for horses and
wolves. She has her heart set on working with animals and being of service as
an animal communicator/healer, perhaps by way of an occupation as a
Veterinarian.

My relevant experience:
I presently work at a Non-Profit, Spiritual Retreat Center here
in SW, FL. I am the Administrative Assistant/Admin (with 6 years experience in
this area). I assist the Director and perform task as a Reservationist,
Innkeeper and set-up for Programs/Events and Facility Use. I handle all guest
and social correspondence, social media, create brochures, flyer designs and
the Newsletters and Periodicals. I coordinate our volunteers and handle
registrations for programs and events. I’m responsible for collecting and
recording incoming funds (including cash donations). I generate end of month
statistics/reports from reservations, programs and spiritual direction, as well
as maintain and update the website. 
I'm certified and registered with Monarchwatch.org and the National Wildlife Federation, as featured in Gulfshore Life Magazine. I've guest appeared on SW Florida’s Lee Pitts Live show and recognized in the Naples Daily News; both acknowledged for my environmentally-rooted endeavors. (see my official website for more)


Down to business ... Where are the funds going?

The funds will be used as a down payment
to purchase the business/properties and all business licenses, fees and such.** The funds will also go to the installing the various butterfly/flower gardens for the pollinators.
**If
it is not enough to secure a mortgage on the property sited in this campaign, I
will then look to a few other properties/options I have in the wings. There is
a property in Oviedo, FL and one just north of Ocala, FL that are of workable
interest.
**If the contributions are
less than workable to secure said property or the properties mentioned above, I will use the contributions as a
base foundation to continue supporting my vision from there. 

Other
avenues of support…
I have a close connection with someone
who has offered to assist me, with the anticipation of securing some additional
financial support through an  ‘Angel investor’.                    
I’ve been in the process of letting go of many of my late dad’s valuables, some furnishings, collectibles and a slew of other unique items that I inherited. They are not my style and it’s time to let these things go to someone seeks them. The funds received from the sale of these items will also go to the endeavors of this campaign.
Note:
Indigogo’s share for hosting this Flexible funding campaign is 5% of the

Risk
and challenges
If I were starting a NEW business, I believe marketing would
be my biggest challenge. However, the present business is already known with
well established repeat guests. Both homes on parcel#1 are rented 90%+,
yearly; with bookings a year and a half out. What I bring will simply be icing

Pics of Perks (see perks page for further details)















Note: For those
contributors receiving Gift Certificates for a Monarch Manor Retreat, the
present owners may have bookings into next year. Gift Certificates can be
redeemed upon availability. You will receive emails notifying you of our
availability and/or any cancellations. Gift Certificates must be redeemed
within 24 months from the day we are operating in the name of ‘Monarch Manor
Retreats’. These perk specials are valid for this campaign and are redeemable during off-peak dates (May 1, 2016- Sep 30, 2016, May 1, 2017- Sep 30, 2017 )
Delivery dates on perks will be announced shortly after campaign goal has been met and has been completed. All perks are applicable in the United States.






Who will help me run things? 
There is a list of dependable
people and businesses who have worked with the present owners for years and I
will benefit the same. All I literally have to do is move in and do what I do! As
synchronicity would have it, the lovely woman who does the after guest housekeeping, is also an “extraordinary gardener (her
yard is a showplace) and she's a ""top-notch baker”. A perfect fit for Monarch/pollinator
gardens and a future Tea Room! Presently, there is no need for additional employees,
everything out side of the Admin/Office tasks (which I will be doing), is done
on an as needed basis. 
Additional
Bonus! The present owner is a “horse lover from birth”…her words.
She owns 6 horses of her own and is ecstatic about my daughter Naomi’s, mutual
love for horses. For a minimal lease she has offered us full use of the
additional 1.5 acre land with a barn so that Naomi may have that for her future
horse and to preserve the raptors habitats on that land.
Note: Even if you do not contribute monetarily to this campaign for Monarch Manor, do some research and contribute by way of becoming aware of the declining numbers of Monarchs and Bees, why and other ways you can assist. Morgan Freeman and More... 
Other Ways You Can Help

 

If any of you have further questions or suggestions
regarding this campaign, just send me a message and I’ll get back to you as
soon as I can.
In advance, I thank every one of you infinitely for
simply reading this. You have contributed your time and energy to my
dream-vision and simply that, can do wonders to bring this all into form.
Obviously, I would love to receive any monetary support any of you (or someone
you may know), are willing to offer. However, if you can simply “pay it
forward” by passing, posting, sharing and emailing my campaign on; that in
itself is a great contribution too. 
May all of us Dream Big in alignment with who we are, and
anticipate those dreams coming true!

</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Theori Fine Arts Center is a 20,000 sq/ft, two floor creation and performance facility.  The venue will feature (1) Grande Theater, (1) Black Box theater, (4) Dance Studios, (2) Recording Studios, (2) Music Rehearsal Rooms, (2) Video Editing Bays, (1) Photography Studio, (1) Video Production Room, and (1) Conference Room.  </p>
<p>The concept behind TFAC is to give artists who do not have the funds, political connections, and staffing, the opportunity to workshop, market, and produce their work at a polished, professional level. Theori Stages and our sister company Reflective Music would function as mentors for new artists, looking for an outlet for their messages. </p>
<p>We would provide the venue, experience, and (when necessary) the staffing to materialize their concepts while allowing them to EARN money from their craft as opposed to going further into debt trying to create. This will create opportunities in our neighborhoods. It will give young people a place to be, besides on the streets. Our elders will be able to share our collective history. Most importantly, we will be realizing dreams and hopefully saving lives.</p>

</ul>
<div>The Impact<p></p>
</div>
<p>In 2004 I had a vision of creating a venue where young people in Chicago could take their creative inspiration and turn it into something concrete. You and I both know the value of art in shaping young people that are caring, driven, and empathetic to the plights of their fellow man. In Chicago we have so many talented people, who simply cannot afford to produce their art. Those can afford it, are forced to venture out of their own community because there simply is nowhere for them to produce. The few venues near our community either over charge or have their own personal agenda that does not include those outside of their circle. This leaves two options: deferred dreams or going to produce work meant for our community elsewhere, where they will never see it. We will change that. </p>
<ul><li>South Side entertainment companies will be able to perform, and create in their own community. Currently, if you want to produce your own work, you have to go to the North Side of Chicago. There simply aren't enough facilities on the South Side. TFAC is located in the South Loop area, a highly accessible location with close proximity to Bronzeville, the McCormick Place, and major public transportation routes. This gives them the ability to have their work seen not only by traditional downtown/north side audiences, but also tourists and the South Side audiences who cannot travel across the city for entertainment. </li></ul>
<ul><li>Ownership of the venue means that we are able offer opportunities that other venues are either unwilling or unable to offer. Our leadership is composed of individuals who created their respective companies from the ground up. We understand what it takes to create; how hard it is to finance; and how frustrating it is to have excellent work that you cannot afford to produce. TFAC sees the opportunity in untold stories and hungry new talent. Our goal is to help cultivate the next generation of cultural leaders, and give the best chance at creating a solid financial foundation, by allowing them the opportunity to create inexpensively and professionally. </li></ul>
<ul><li>
<p>The physical venue would function as a performance venue, training facility, networking hub, and a fine dining establishment. It will be a cultural and social boon to our community.</p>
<p>Entertainment venues attract businesses to the local surrounding area, which employ more people, who are then able to spend more money; in effect, boosting our local economy. The location we have chosen is close enough to the downtown area to attract patrons who typically do not venture south, while still being able to cater directly to our community. It is accessible and in line with Mayor Emmanuel’s vision to revitalize business on the south side. Our ownership as minorities helps to negate gentrification and protect our cultural history in the South Loop/Bronzeville area. </p>

</div>
<p>This is definitely a monumental goal. There are several challenges: Financing, Competition from other venues, Balancing artistic freedom and social empowerment with fiscal responsibility. We are laser focused on meeting these challenges head on: with careful planning, transparency in policy, and tutelage from experienced individuals to help guide us. </p>
<p>To maintain fiscal stability we will pursue the following revenue streams:</p>
<p>1)  Original Programming from Theori Stages and Reflective Music<br/>2)  Business Hour Dining at our onsite restaurant<br/>3)  Rental of our Dance, Recording, and Video Production Studios, Conference Rooms, and rehearsal spaces<br/>4)  Rental of our Grand Theatre and Black Box Theatre<br/>5)  Arts Grants and Endowments</p>
<p>Our staff is composed of well educated, talented individuals with experience in their respective fields, who have the ability to mentor burgeoning artist, while still being young enough to find innovative ways to redefine what it means to create. Our support system has decades of experience in venue management, talent development, technical direction, and financial management. They will help guide us in making sure that our altruistic goals never subvert our fiscal responsibilities. We are not in this for the short term, Theori Fine Arts Centre is going to be a permanent part of Chicago’s cultural community. </p>

<p>During my time in Liberia last year, I worked with a Liberian agronomist, Macon Tubman and a colleague, Kali Erickson from FHI360. Shortly after I left Liberia, the Ebola epidemic spread quickly from remote rural areas near the Guinean border to the capital - Monrovia. By May 2015, there were 27,309 cases in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone, nearly half of those who contracted Ebola died. Liberia faced the highest death toll of 4,806. </p>
<p>Some lost their entire families. Liberia was declared Ebola free on May 9, 2015 with help from the US and Liberia. But the battle is not over, 11,000 children in Guinea, Liberian and Sierra Leone have lost one or both parents and many lost everything.  </p>
<p>We stayed in touch with Macon after our trip to Liberia and he highlighted the significant problems that many Ebola survivors continue to face. He  introduced us to a local non-profit called Teens Focus which was created by Liberian refugees in Ghana in 2007 to help young Liberians in the camps. They returned to Liberia in 2012 to continue their work. To date, they have provided scholarships to girls and trained youth in life skills and vocations, especially pregnant teen mothers. In 2014, Teens Focus encouraged its network of young people to assist in Ebola awareness and prevention campaigns within their own communities. They are currently involved in raising awareness about the plight of orphans and other Ebola survivors.</p>
<p>Though international non-profits and donors were very active during the epidemic, assistance to Ebola survivors to help people get back on their feet  has been more limited.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
 
My name is Emmet Murphy, I launched my firm Nile
Point to build upon my passion to reduce malnutrition in the world’s poorest countries. In June 2015 I was in Liberia during the Ebola epidemic to write a 5 year
food security strategy with FHI360 FANTA on behalf of USAID Food for Peace. 

During my time in Liberia last year, I worked with a Liberian agronomist, Macon Tubman and a colleague, Kali Erickson from FHI360. Shortly after I left Liberia, the Ebola epidemic spread quickly from remote rural areas near the Guinean border to the capital - Monrovia. By May 2015, there were 27,309 cases in Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone, nearly half of those who contracted Ebola died. Liberia faced the highest death toll of 4,806. 
Some lost their entire families. Liberia was declared Ebola free on May 9, 2015 with help from the US and Liberia. But the battle is not over, 11,000 children in Guinea, Liberian and Sierra Leone have lost one or both parents and many lost everything.  
We stayed in touch with Macon after our trip to Liberia and he highlighted the significant problems that many Ebola survivors continue to face. He  introduced us to a local non-profit called Teens Focus which was created by Liberian refugees in Ghana in 2007 to help young Liberians in the camps. They returned to Liberia in 2012 to continue their work. To date, they have provided scholarships to girls and trained youth in life skills and vocations, especially pregnant teen mothers. In 2014, Teens Focus encouraged its network of young people to assist in Ebola awareness and prevention campaigns within their own communities. They are currently involved in raising awareness about the plight of orphans and other Ebola survivors.
Though international non-profits and donors were very active during the epidemic, assistance to Ebola survivors to help people get back on their feet  has been more limited.

What We Need & What You Get
 
We are raising funds for a few individuals significantly affected by Ebola in Monrovia, Liberia and featured in the campaign pitch video, namely Mansan Sheriff, Moses Goi, Dudu Kromah, Yusuo Kromah and Lorpu Kollie, as well as Kormassa Kollie, Allison Wesley and Irene Goi.  Help Nile Point and Teens Focus
provide: 
• 
Rent in Monrovia for four families for one year to help people get back on their
feet  (50% of funds raised will pay for rent)
• School fees for children, school uniform and materials (15% of funds) 
• 
Seed money to restart a dry goods and African fabric businesses (10% of funds)
• 
Funds for Teens Focus to promote Ebola prevention messages (10% of funds)
• Funds for people to replace personal effects lost during epidemic (5% of funds)
Should we exceed our goal
of $10,000, we will provide support to an additional 27 orphans and 17 Ebola
survivors based on lists compiled by Teens Focus. 

In addition to the budget above, we will also have to cover international wire fees and small costs related to the campaign.
If we do not reach our goal of $10,000, we will provide whatever funds we raise to Teens Focus to distribute accordingly.
The Impact
 In the age of 20 second sound bites and tragic stories that capture our attention for just a moment, we feel that the after effects of the Ebola outbreak in West Africa has already been forgotten by the global media. We aspire to raise awareness of this ongoing problem in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone and provide assistance to a few Liberian Ebola survivors with your generous support. 
Nile Point is a new firm, but members of our team have extensive experience in the international development sector working in various African countries, the Middle East and Caribbean. This story spoke to us personally following our trip to Liberia during the early stages of the Ebola epidemic.
Risks & Challenges
 Our firm has contacts in Monrovia that will follow up with Teens Focus to ensure that funds will be used appropriately. To the extent possible, we will wire funds directly to individuals if they have their own bank accounts. Given that we do not have a presence in Liberia, we will rely upon trusted colleagues on the ground to ensure that funds are used as intended.

We named her back to  Viking- the original name it carried for more than 20 years before it was changed to Elohim last year.  Week after week of camping in the rain (and few showers), we went to work to save the engines, and cleaned it up little by little. It was full of endless surprises and challenges.  We used what  little money we had to clean up and revive salvaged parts, and removed twenty plus 55 gallon drums full of oily waste water mixed with what seemed a never-ending  supply of maggots. But it was not in vain!</div>
<div><br/></div><div>To our glory we got both engines turned over, and then running- a $30,000 save! One step at a time things got more and more exciting; next we flushed  hydraulics and got those systems fully functioning. </div><div><br/></div>
<div>All winter was spent rewiring  everything and replacing important electrical components, engine parts, refurbishing the cabin and thoroughly cleaning all the tanks,   We managed to have the salvaged 10,000 pound seine net  rebuilt (a $28,000 endeavor), reinforced two trailers to be able to hold the seine net and the skiff. In January Justice hopped on a cod fishing boat for 3 months, and headed out to Dutch Harbor and the Berring sea to raise more money for it all. And let us not forget the relentless cleaning that is still a daily progress.</div><div><br/></div>

<div>To buy a permit to seine for salmon in Prince William Sound right now is around $200,000. That is not in our ball park at this time, so the other option is leasing one.

<div>If we can get this last bit of money in the next week or so, we can head out to start fishing immediately and make this dream come alive while the season is still anew!</div>
<div><br/></div>

<ul>
<li>Permit down payment- $10,000</li>

After ten years of deckhanding other people's fishing boats, Justice Cousins finally bought his own! With one catch: she needed to be totally refurbished. The boat met with disaster last year and rolled over while fishing. Its motors and systems were saturated in salt water for weeks and there was oil in every crevice, mold festering, and last but not least the remnants of what was 10,000 pounds of rotting salmon trapped inside the fish-hold. Ammonia, maggots galore. 
Quickly our crew formed and united to help Justice with the new goal. We named her back to  Viking- the original name it carried for more than 20 years before it was changed to Elohim last year.  Week after week of camping in the rain (and few showers), we went to work to save the engines, and cleaned it up little by little. It was full of endless surprises and challenges.  We used what  little money we had to clean up and revive salvaged parts, and removed twenty plus 55 gallon drums full of oily waste water mixed with what seemed a never-ending  supply of maggots. But it was not in vain!
To our glory we got both engines turned over, and then running- a $30,000 save! One step at a time things got more and more exciting; next we flushed  hydraulics and got those systems fully functioning. 
All winter was spent rewiring  everything and replacing important electrical components, engine parts, refurbishing the cabin and thoroughly cleaning all the tanks,   We managed to have the salvaged 10,000 pound seine net  rebuilt (a $28,000 endeavor), reinforced two trailers to be able to hold the seine net and the skiff. In January Justice hopped on a cod fishing boat for 3 months, and headed out to Dutch Harbor and the Berring sea to raise more money for it all. And let us not forget the relentless cleaning that is still a daily progress.
This past spring, Justice's former captain proudly hooked him up with his old skiff, which we have been revamping and is near to being ready as well.
                                         We're so close to being ready to fish. 
The season is upon us. All we need is a little bit of help and we can make this happen. What is left the make this happen:

<div>The city of Sombor, Serbia is dying out. Once wide-known for its artistic and inclusive culture, recent wars and political turmoil have left it impoverished, eventless and unattractive.

With no-one to lead, or show the way, the young don't even know where to start. The prevailing culture has become that of pessimism and discouragement.</div>

<p>The main challenge we face is raising enough funds to accelerate the chosen teams in our first year of operations. There is a risk that by October, when our programme is due to start, we will not have secured a grant that would finance it.  </p>
<p>But even in that scenario, we will not lay down our arms. We will continue to push towards securing an investment, with our director, Tanja, tirelessly knocking on every door, and our chairman, Serge, covering monthly expenses from his own personal savings. We will fully utilize our network of advisors towards that one goal, until the money is in and we are ready to revive our city. We will never, ever give up on Sombor and its people.</p>

The city of Sombor, Serbia is dying out. Once wide-known for its artistic and inclusive culture, recent wars and political turmoil have left it impoverished, eventless and unattractive. Its youth finds no moral nor financial support to explore its talents and express its abundant ideas, creativity and ethusiasm. With no-one to lead, or show the way, the young don't even know where to start. The prevailing culture has become that of pessimism and discouragement.

Determined to shake things up, Tanja Adzic (LinkedIn), and Serge Bajic (LinkedIn), a linguist and an MBA graduate, have took it upon themselves to make Sombor worth living in. They started ""Fabrika"" (Factory),  a social non profit accelerator that will provide working space, mentorship, financial support and easier access to funds to young teams with great ideas. Their vision is to change the town's culture to that of activism, creativity and innovation.



Fabrika will provide office space, mentorship, and assistance in obtaining financial grants to local teams with ideas of potentially great social value.


They need supporters who will help start ""Fabrika""-s manufacturing process, and save this gorgeous town and its youth from being left behind and forgotten.

We have recieved a lot of praise and support for our effort, with many prominent Serbian activists offering pro-bono assistance. However, albeit welcome, we know that praise alone is not enough to make things happen. 
The main challenge we face is raising enough funds to accelerate the chosen teams in our first year of operations. There is a risk that by October, when our programme is due to start, we will not have secured a grant that would finance it.  
But even in that scenario, we will not lay down our arms. We will continue to push towards securing an investment, with our director, Tanja, tirelessly knocking on every door, and our chairman, Serge, covering monthly expenses from his own personal savings. We will fully utilize our network of advisors towards that one goal, until the money is in and we are ready to revive our city. We will never, ever give up on Sombor and its people.

Other Ways You Can Help

 If you are not able to help financially, don't worry - there are other ways you can contribute. Share our campaign on your Facebook walls, and IM the persons in your network who are likely to be interested in our cause, and familiar with institutions providing grants to organizations such as ours.

Finally - a great, big thanks. If you're ever in the neighbourhood, Sombor and its majestic people and culture will welcome you. And be sure to give us a call - we'll be happy to show you around. 

We'd like to thank Aleksandra, Ena, Jovana, Marko, and English Language Academy Sombor for their help in creating this campaign.",11.0,0,"3 Campaigns

As Sunshine wanted to support this girl to send her to musical school in order to get proper training, but the school fees are not cheap. They knew I have organized several successful fundraising events, so they asked me if I could help this girl. So I made a trip to Vietnam this summer to visit her and the Te-Phan orphanage to make sure everything was kosher. After my visit I knew it is worth organizing an fundraising event to raise money for her school fees, and Nhi is so excited to come to HK on 2 Oct to perform at <a href=""http://www.artouchk.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Artouch HK </a>and meet the donors. </p>
<p><b>WHY</b> I support the Te-Phan Orphanage: they were established in 1985 as a private orphanage not backed by the government
or other foundations. They currently have 59
children residing there from 14 months old to over 30 years old but disabled. 21 of the
children are normal and the rest are disabled, abandoned by their families. So they are particularly concerned with their education, and see where a child
has talent, like Nhi in music, and then help to support them. Education is
important as it gives the children belief in themselves, and more confidence and hope can bring them a brighter future. </p>

</div></div>","how I started this fundraising idea ... My name is Sze Chow, I am an artist & also the founder of Artouch HK. I learnt about this talented little blind orphan kid Nhi's story from Sunny & Alfred, who are the founders of Sunshine Action Charity . Nhi is a self taught pianist since last year, but she has shown a great musical gift. As Sunshine wanted to support this girl to send her to musical school in order to get proper training, but the school fees are not cheap. They knew I have organized several successful fundraising events, so they asked me if I could help this girl. So I made a trip to Vietnam this summer to visit her and the Te-Phan orphanage to make sure everything was kosher. After my visit I knew it is worth organizing an fundraising event to raise money for her school fees, and Nhi is so excited to come to HK on 2 Oct to perform at Artouch HK and meet the donors. 
WHY I support the Te-Phan Orphanage: they were established in 1985 as a private orphanage not backed by the government
or other foundations. They currently have 59
children residing there from 14 months old to over 30 years old but disabled. 21 of the

has talent, like Nhi in music, and then help to support them. Education is
important as it gives the children belief in themselves, and more confidence and hope can bring them a brighter future. 
Where are the funds going ?


The funds will be going to support Nhi's 2 years of musical school fees in Ho Chi Minh City conservatoire http://hcmcons.vn/ . It has only one musical school but is able to teach blind people. It costs about 150 USD per month for two days' classes
per week ( one on one ) and lasts at least 2 years, so will cost around USD3600. If we can raise more then we can support other orphaned children from the Te-Phan Orphanage. Your donation is 100% going to support them, as we have zero admin fee to organize this fundraising event, and I try to make the cost as low as possible, so the cost is mainly for their flight tickets, as we have a generous donor who has offered free accommodation, and the venue is sponsored by Artouch HK . 
   Your donation can open her eyes & support other orphaned children 

Besides sending Nhi to musical school to open her eyes and bring her a brighter future, I hope this fund raising will also raise awareness about this lovely orphanage. When I visited them, I couldn't imagine looking after so many kids as it is not easy especially given most of them are disabled, but they are like family as the normal kids look after those disabled ones. Also they are making handcrafted cards and paintings to sell for self funding to support their ""family"", so I'm hoping through this event to find more private donors to support them.

</div><div> <p>My name is Fitzgerald Limisella, founder of Nerfun (<a href=""http://www.nerfun.co.nz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.nerfun.co.nz</a>), a small business based in Auckland, New Zealand. Nerfun currently offers services<b> </b>in the form of Nerf and Laser Tag/Laser Strike battle parties. My mission is to provide fun in a safe manner and ensure a hassle-free event for my valued customers.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1438610015/qhxp9cipskyicahhjxss.jpg"" src="""" style=""background-color: initial;""/></p>

<p>I started the business about 2 years ago and was the first in New Zealand to offer a Nerf battle party. About a year ago, I added laser tag to Nerfun's offering. It has proven to be quite popular as people would normally have to go to a laser tag facility to play. With Nerfun, you can play Nerf or laser tag <u>or both</u> in your very own backyard. </p>
<p>Now I would like to bring Archery Tag, an increasingly popular sport with hundreds of operations worldwide, to Auckland. In order to do that, I need your help.</p>
<h3>How does it all work?</h3>
<p>Nerfun provides a mobile service, so that means I come to you whether that be your home, nearby park, or the local school hall. Archery Tag will be offered in the same way.  A level playing area of 11 m x 24 m, which is about the size of a tennis court, is ideal.</p>
<p>An Archery Tag session is likely to last for up to 2 hours. The first 30 minutes would probably be spent on explaining the safety and game rules, and maybe a couple of practice rounds if required. The remaining 90 minutes would then be for game play.</p>
<h4>How do you play?</h4>
<p>The original game set up by Archery Tag is a bit like dodgeball. Please check out the video below for a bit of info about how to play the game and general instructions about how to fire an Archery Tag arrow.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FnxERxitOUUY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DnxERxitOUUY&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FnxERxitOUUY%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>I am interested in implementing other types of games as well, such as Capture the Flag. So I envision having a couple of game types with a couple of rounds per game type. Whether or not these can be integrated into Archery Tag remains to be seen but I will keep you posted.</p>
<h4>Will it hurt?</h4>
<p>It could be described as being hit by a tennis ball thrown by someone. It is certainly not as painful as being hit by a paint ball which generally leaves marks and sometimes welts on your skin. It is very safe as the arrows are made with a patented foam-tipped design. The only safety equipment you need (which will be provided) is a face mask.</p>
<h4>How much will it cost?</h4>
<p>When it launches, the price is likely to be NZ$40 per person for the 2 hours of game time for between 8 to 16 players. If you have less than 8 players, you can still book but the minimum price of $320 still applies. Let's compare it with paintball operations. Most paintball places charge about $40 per person for their most basic package, which would give you around 150 or 200 paint balls. Depending on how trigger happy you are, you would probably last between 15 minutes to an hour. Bigger packages cost a lot more. With Archery Tag, there is no limit to the number of arrows, so to speak. For as long as you can retrieve them, which should be easy as people fire arrows at each other, then you can keep playing.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 24px; background-color: initial;"">What is the minimum age?</span><br/></p>
<p>Minimum age will be 10 years and there really is no maximum age. For as long as you are fit enough to run around, hide and pull the bow string, then you're good to go!</p>
<h3><b>Ok, you've got me all excited! What do you need?</b></h3>
<p>Thought you'd never ask! Well, to be a licensed operator and to purchase the Silver package, I need around NZ$15,000 (around US$10,000 currently) including shipping to New Zealand. The package includes:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>16 bows</li>
<li>64 arrows</li>
<li>16 masks</li>
<li>1 five-spot target set</li>
<li>6 bunkers</li>
<li>other bits and pieces, such as spare strings, bags, manuals, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently I am aiming to launch by the end of the year or early next year, but there are factors that may change things, such as shipping delays, etc.</p>
<h3>What do I get for contributing?</h3>
<div>You not only get to be one of the first people to try out Archery Tag, but you also get to play it at a special rate! As most of the perks give you a free game when we launch, it is therefore lower than our proposed standard pricing of $40 per person. The higher the contribution the larger the discount is per person. There will be a window of time, probably about a week prior to the big day, where you will have a chance to pre-book to secure a spot before the general public.  It is still subject to availability as there may be another backer who wants the same date and time.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>There is also a special <b>Lifetime Membership</b> perk. Once the Indiegogo campaign is over, this Lifetime Membership will no longer be available.  Only our Annual Membership will be available after this time, for a yearly fee of NZ$100 per person. The Lifetime Membership will never have any annual fees - so don't miss out, there are only 50 of these!</div>
<div>The Lifetime and Annual Memberships will offer a range of benefits, such as:</div>
<div><ul>
<li>10% discount on each Archery Tag booking</li>
<li>10% discount on each Nerf and/or Laser Strike booking</li>
<li>Personalised membership ID card</li>
<li>Free entry to future league games or tournaments (only applicable to the Member, not for the entire team)</li>
<li>Other benefits as we introduce more products and/or services</li>
</ul></div>
<div>All perks will have your full name immortalised on the website as well. It will be displayed on a specific Thank You page. Please do let me know if you only want your first name displayed or don't wish for your name to be displayed at all.</div>
<div>If it all goes well, then I'll consider adding more rewards.</div>
<div>Please note that all this (prices,  game duration, membership benefits, etc) could change, but any changes will be communicated.<br/>

With Archery Tag, there is no limit to the number of arrows, so to speak. For as long as you can retrieve them, which should be easy as people fire arrows at each other, then you can keep playing.
What is the minimum age?
Minimum age will be 10 years and there really is no maximum age. For as long as you are fit enough to run around, hide and pull the bow string, then you're good to go!
Ok, you've got me all excited! What do you need?
Thought you'd never ask! Well, to be a licensed operator and to purchase the Silver package, I need around NZ$15,000 (around US$10,000 currently) including shipping to New Zealand. The package includes:


16 bows
64 arrows
16 masks
1 five-spot target set
6 bunkers
other bits and pieces, such as spare strings, bags, manuals, etc.

Currently I am aiming to launch by the end of the year or early next year, but there are factors that may change things, such as shipping delays, etc.
What do I get for contributing?
You not only get to be one of the first people to try out Archery Tag, but you also get to play it at a special rate! As most of the perks give you a free game when we launch, it is therefore lower than our proposed standard pricing of $40 per person. The higher the contribution the larger the discount is per person. There will be a window of time, probably about a week prior to the big day, where you will have a chance to pre-book to secure a spot before the general public.  It is still subject to availability as there may be another backer who wants the same date and time.

There is also a special Lifetime Membership perk. Once the Indiegogo campaign is over, this Lifetime Membership will no longer be available.  Only our Annual Membership will be available after this time, for a yearly fee of NZ$100 per person. The Lifetime Membership will never have any annual fees - so don't miss out, there are only 50 of these!
The Lifetime and Annual Memberships will offer a range of benefits, such as:

10% discount on each Archery Tag booking
10% discount on each Nerf and/or Laser Strike booking
Personalised membership ID card
Free entry to future league games or tournaments (only applicable to the Member, not for the entire team)
Other benefits as we introduce more products and/or services

All perks will have your full name immortalised on the website as well. It will be displayed on a specific Thank You page. Please do let me know if you only want your first name displayed or don't wish for your name to be displayed at all.
If it all goes well, then I'll consider adding more rewards.
Please note that all this (prices,  game duration, membership benefits, etc) could change, but any changes will be communicated.



 Stretch Goal 1 - $14,000 (or around NZ$20,000)

So if this stretch goal is unlocked, we will have 20 bows, so more people can play at once! Along with more bows, we also get more arrows, 2 target sets and 12 bunkers. Please note that if you have 20 players, it does not mean that all 12 bunkers will be deployed. Bunker deployment is subject to space availability and time constraints.



 Stretch Goal 2 - $16,000 (or around NZ$25,000)

If this stretch goal is unlocked, we will have 24 bows and even more arrows, so you can bring even more friends to enjoy this timeless sport! Bring on the battles!

    I am interested, but I can't contribute at this time That's fine if you can't contribute right now, you can still help by spreading the word. The more people who know about this, the more likely the campaign gets funded. You can share the link to this Indiegogo campaign. You can also visit our Facebook page (www.facebook.com/nerfun), like the page and let other people know about this campaign.
So, thank you so very much in advance.  Whether you aspire to be a Robin Hood, a Katniss Everdeen, a Legolas, a Hawkeye, a Princess Merida, or a Green Arrow - I look forward to seeing a new generation of super archers!",6.0,2,"1 Campaign
