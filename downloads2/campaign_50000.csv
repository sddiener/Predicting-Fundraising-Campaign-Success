<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>BLUEPRINT's goal is to EXPAND our global imagination for what is possible for the future of our planet.</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>We are living in such an extraordinary time in history...</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Our ecosystems are in collapse, our oceans are acidifying, yet we have incredible technology and science available to us. So what is preventing us from reaching our fullest potential of planetary health? </strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.blueprint-films.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>BLUEPRINT film series</strong></a> is the culmination of years of research, inquiry and observation of the cultural stories we hold. Exploring narratives of transformation during this extreme ecological time for our planet has shown me <strong>this is a time of HOPE, not fear.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>BLUEPRINT</strong> unites artful cinematography and inspiring interviews all while approaching cultural and climate change through a lens of spiritual connection. I believe in order to survive what scientists are calling the sixth great extinction, we must enter a deep transformation on our planet. Together we will navigate how these crises can act as spiritual awakenings for each of us in our own lives. I draw upon new science emerging in <strong>neurocardiology and quantum physics</strong> that mirrors the ancient <strong>Indigenous wisdom &amp; technologies</strong> across the world. The stories I have gathered help audiences connect with their own inherent relationship to the earth and each other. Our goal is to bring you outside of the box thinking and tools to develop our new human story.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Our Needs:</strong></h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Funding a film is no joke. But totally doable! </strong></p>
<p>I've seen the amazing efforts of communities come together to fund public art projects when I worked as a muralist in Philadelphia. I know the power of a shared goal and am so excited to present this goal to you, my digital tribe. I thank you all so much in advance for considering investing in this project. To say this is my passion project is an understatement. I have spent sleepless nights developing this film idea. The people in my immediate circle will tell you how much of a crazy person I have been. But when I believe in something, I have to give all of myself. And I promise to give all of myself to using these funds towards the healing of our global narrative and make a film you can be proud of. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Funding for the filming of the pilot episode:</strong></p>
<p>Filming equipment, editing software, flights/ travel to interview sites, room &amp; board on the road for myself and talented crew that will accompany me, editing fees, insurance, website maintenance, promo costs, Indiegogo &amp; credit card fees. I am using all available camera equipment I already have and a few sweet friends that have lent/ gifted me a few items I didn't. If you have filming equipment that you would like to donate, I would be so thankful to make use of it. </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Meet my Standing Rock brother</h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Alex Simon!</h2>
<p>The night I heard Alex's music for the first time was one of those moments in life I'll never forget. It went straight into my heart and has stayed there ever since. It was a freezing cold winter evening in November at Standing Rock, North Dakota. The team from MASH (Media Artists Serving Humanity) had gathered by the fire after a long day and Alex offered to play his music, as we all huddled together. As the notes began to play, everything stood still, I was mesmerized. It made an already life altering experience transcend time and space. His music truly celebrates the human spirit and all of our relatives both from the animal and plant families. I have wanted to collaborate with my brother from our Standing Rock Family for so long and I feel so lucky he will be sharing his incredible talent scoring BLUEPRINT. </p>

<p>As with any big undertaking there are bound to be some challenges and risks. <strong>I have spent years preparing for this next step</strong>, but even with all the preparation I can not promise things will turn out exactly the way I hope. Honestly, I hate to fly. This is more of a personal challenge for me (not going to lie, sometimes I have a stuffed animal with me), but it has never stopped me from getting on a plane. If anyone has any anxiety remedies for flying, let me know! Back to the more serious issues. Right now, funding is one of my biggest challenges. As opposed to painting or digital photography, filmmaking is in a whole other ball game for budget. It was an eye opener just how much everything costs. Even though I'm determined to make this film with whatever resources I can find, <strong>I want to make it as visually compelling and beautiful as I can. I want the audience to have a transformative experience.</strong> <strong>And I want to pay the team I work with the money they deserve for their amazing talent.</strong> I believe in this project more than any other I have ever undertaken. I have logged untold hours of research and thoughtful conversation with people in the industry and family and friends about the concepts presented. At times I have wanted to quit. It has also been isolating and exhausting. But I can't think of anything more I'd rather be doing then spending my time here on this planet telling the stories of the earth, our animal and plant relatives and the beautiful humans that live here.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a striving director that moved to LA straight from high school in 2015 to go to The Los Angeles Film School.</p>
<p>This is my passion project and my thesis film for school. I came up with this idea months ago and just had to make it. It deals with some issues that I had to deal with when I was younger but in a style that people can enjoy watching.</p>
<p>Your contributions will be a huge help in the creation of this project. This not only will bring a dream to a close, but it can help me begin to achieve bigger dreams I have. This will also help new and upcoming actors to get a foothold in this crazy business of film.</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Almost all of the funding will go towards making the Soul Shop look the way it needs to look for all of you to believe that it's a Soul Shop when you watch it. Some of it will also go towards feeding the cast and crew so that they can have a good time doing what they love. (No one wants to work on an empty stomach, even if it's their passion.)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution to this project will lead to the creation of this project which will in turn lead to your potential personal enjoyment. It doesn't stop there, this will open up doors that'll allow more projects of mine to be made which will also be made for your enjoyment.</p>

<p>The two biggest risks in this project is getting the walls to look realistic in the soul shop and to make the souls look the way I want them to. Luckily, I have a very talented Production Designer to help figure out and work through these obstacles.</p>

<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>

<p>On the surface, gay people have never had it so good. We can get married. We’re on TV. We’re encouraged to be funnier, louder and hotter than just about everyone else.  </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Progress in LGBT+ rights in the 50 years since the repeal of the Sexual Offences Act, culminating in the legalisation of gay marriage, has been remarkable and positive. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>At the same time, HIV infection rates among gay men have never been so high, social media has added huge pressure to look hot, masculine and young, and chem sex addiction is on the rise. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>But these contradictions are missing from films about gay men.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>'My Loneliness Is Killing Me was a reaction to seeing so many films about gay and bisexual men that weren’t about gay or queer culture; it was about being part of a community and wanting to see the lives of myself and the gay and queer men I know onscreen, especially when it comes to club and hookup culture. There are so many stories to tell in this world, and so many that aren’t being told' - <i>Michael Lee Richardson, writer</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>MY LONELINESS IS KILLING ME explores the complicated and sometimes harsh reality of contemporary gay life, and uses the gay male experience as a prism to examine universal themes of fear of loneliness, the need to be desired, and dissatisfaction with conformity.</p>

The film is about the fight to defend ethnic studies in Arizona schools, and it follows the personal awakening of a high school soccer player whose eyes open up to the struggle that is happening around him. </p><p> </p><h3>THE FIGHT FOR EDUCATION IN ARIZONA</h3><p>The battle for education in Arizona has been intense. For years, students have dealt with underfunded and undervalued public schools, especially in Latino communities.</p><p>In spite of this, the ethnic studies program at Tucson Unified School District was the largest of its kind, and it was hugely successful.

<p><strong>Why make a film about Pauline Oliveros?</strong></p>
<p><i>Through Pauline Oliveros and Deep Listening, I finally know what harmony is…It’s about the pleasure of making music.</i></p>
<p> - John Cage, 1989</p>
<p><i>Pauline Oliveros, a distinguished American composer who played a major role in the development of experimental music, passed away peacefully on November 24, 2016. Born in 1932 in Houston, Texas, Oliveros pioneered collaborative mixed-media compositions with electronic sounds, light projections and theatrical elements during the 1960s. She also created tape music compositions now considered classic works in the history of electronic music and contributed to the early development of free improvisation. Oliveros embraced the infinite variety of sounds in our world. She viewed this sonic multiplicity as a “a grand composition” and was committed to developing and teaching perceptual skills that made it possible for both musicians and non-musicians to appreciate this global “sound environment.” She extended this praxis to “Deep Listening,” a form of meditative art that focuses not only on the sounds of the external world, but also on the more ephemeral sounds of our innermost thoughts. Listening, for Oliveros, is a foundation for collaborative work and a means to form communities, which can cultivate an appreciation of human diversity. This film will powerfully convey Oliveros’ profound message at a time in human history when it is most needed.</i></p>
<p>- David W. Bernstein, Head of Music Department, Mills College   </p>
<p>In this time of divisiveness and disillusionment, we hear again and again the complaint that the American public feels it is “not being listened to.” Pauline Oliveros dedicated her entire life to providing an antidote for this very malaise. The world could certainly use her presence right now, but sadly she is no longer with us to offer her council. “Deep Listening: The Story of Pauline Oliveros,” has thus become a crucial conduit for passing along Pauline’s wisdom and illuminations. </p>
<p>To those who encountered her, or are familiar with her work due to a knowledge of the avant garde and contemporary American music, Pauline was an indisputable giant of the American arts. It can be easily argued, in fact, that there is no other post-war artist who contributed so much to the cultural landscape. Pauline can easily be elevated to elite status simply for her work as a composer. However, that barely scratches the surface of her contributions. In her unusually prolific six decade career, Pauline also made invaluable contributions as a groundbreaking improviser, multi-media guru, technological innovator, writer, teacher, mentor, philosopher, humanitarian and as an advocate for women and people with disabilities. </p>
<p>While Pauline has been widely recognized by a variety of institutions, it is the filmmaker’s hope that “Deep Listening: The Story of Pauline Oliveros”, can broaden that recognition to the public as a whole. Perhaps, through Pauline, we can all learn to really listen.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508289028/rxoobikffe2tuifpcgpr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Why are you the best person to make this film?</strong></p>
<p><i>First, Daniel is the best person to do a documentary on my life and work because he has shown extraordinary interest in my work. Daniel’s filming is excellent and he is also an expert audio engineer. Daniel’s expertise in both audio and film is very important to me. His knowledge of music is also important to me.</i></p>
<p><i>In the two years that we have worked together on the film, Daniel has gathered numerous interviews. All my friends that have been interviewed are very impressed with the way that he is working with the material and have enjoyed Daniel’s questions. </i></p>
<p><i>I am eager for Daniel to take the next steps towards completing the film.</i></p>
<p>- Pauline Oliveros</p>
<p>Pauline and I both shared the feeling that this story is made for me to tell. I looked for many years for a subject about which to do my first feature length documentary. When my neighbor in upstate New York introduced me to Pauline, I knew I had found a subject that would inspire me throughout the inevitably lengthy process of making a film, and I also felt an instant obligation to share the story of this incomparable American icon. In the process of making this film, Pauline and I became close friends. Now that she has left this plane, I feel an even greater obligation to tell her story. I can think of few other people of the last century whose message of healing, unity and unbridled creative expression is more deeply needed at this time in American history.</p>
<p>I have dedicated my entire life since my early teens to music and filmmaking. In all those years, I never found a subject like Pauline Oliveros who provides me with such a perfect outlet for both passions. It is absolutely crucial, when making a film about someone to whom listening is the center of her personal and artistic world, that the filmmaker have a very advanced knowledge of music and sound recording and editing. I know that Pauline chose to work with me on this project because of my experience as a recording engineer as well as the use of sound in my films. In fact, in the time that I have been working on this film, I have also mixed a record for Pauline and Miya Masaoka, and recorded and mixed Pauline’s final record made with Nels Cline and Thollem McDonas. </p>
<p>Finally, there is the practical side of the equation. I live only a few miles away from where Pauline lived in The Hudson Valley, and where her spouse of thirty years, Ione, still lives. I was able to track Pauline's career very closely and  spent countless hours with her over the nearly three years we worked together on this film. In the past year, I am blessed to have Ione offer me the same level of support and guidance I received from Pauline.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508289182/wavho0wg68mvauxkscjs.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Why do you need so much money to finish a film?</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the generosity of my Indiegogo contributors and a grant from The Robert Bielecki Foundation, production on ""Deep Listening: The Story of Pauline Oliveros"" is complete. The production process was successful beyond all expectations. I interviewed over 30 people for the film, including: Pauline, Ione, Morton Subotnik, Tony Martin, Ramon Sender, Anna Halprin, Bert Turetsky, Claire Chase, Mark Dresser, Linda Montano, Miya Masaoka and many more incredible individuals. I have also scoured archives at Mills College, UCSD and NYU. I have had access to Pauline and Iones' personal archive as well as many generous archival contributions from others who worked and/or played with Pauline over the years. </p>
<p>The end result of these past three years of work is that I have an astounding amount of material I now need to somehow distill into a two hour film. In my twenty years as an editor, this is the greatest challenge I have faced (just as I'm sure Pauline would want it!). </p>
<p>The $35,000 being requested here is actually only a portion of what is needed to complete the film. If this fund drive can bring in more, it will only result in a better final product. Any remaining funding will be secured through traditional grants. </p>
<p>Film post production is expensive. To begin with, we are looking at a minimum of two months of editing for which assistants will need to be hired. The production will also need to hire someone to secure rights for the huge amount of archival still images, film and sounds that will be in the documentary. In many cases, additional funding will be needed to pay for those rights and get hi-res copies of images and film. The last stages of post-production are color correction and sound mix. Each of those services cost a minimum of $10,000. Finally, if enough funding is secured, the filmmaker will hire a marketing expert to make sure the finished film is seen by as many people as possible. </p>
<p>As Pauline herself wrote in 2007: “What, then, of my work do I hope will last? Well, what I am most interested in is not specific pieces surviving, but the understanding of Deep Listening and of the practices and processes that will lead to individual and collective creativity. That is what I would like to hand on.” We believe that this film can help in that noble pursuit. Please help us spend the time and energy needed to tell the story of this remarkable artist and her vibrant and varied career.</p>
<p>Any amount you can donate will be greatly appreciated. If you cannot donate money right now, then help us spread the word using the Indiegogo share tools. Finally, don’t forget to keep on listening!</p>

Pauline can easily be elevated to elite status simply for her work as a composer. However, that barely scratches the surface of her contributions. In her unusually prolific six decade career, Pauline also made invaluable contributions as a groundbreaking improviser, multi-media guru, technological innovator, writer, teacher, mentor, philosopher, humanitarian and as an advocate for women and people with disabilities. 
While Pauline has been widely recognized by a variety of institutions, it is the filmmaker’s hope that “Deep Listening: The Story of Pauline Oliveros”, can broaden that recognition to the public as a whole. Perhaps, through Pauline, we can all learn to really listen.

Why are you the best person to make this film?
First, Daniel is the best person to do a documentary on my life and work because he has shown extraordinary interest in my work. Daniel’s filming is excellent and he is also an expert audio engineer. Daniel’s expertise in both audio and film is very important to me. His knowledge of music is also important to me.
In the two years that we have worked together on the film, Daniel has gathered numerous interviews. All my friends that have been interviewed are very impressed with the way that he is working with the material and have enjoyed Daniel’s questions. 
I am eager for Daniel to take the next steps towards completing the film.
- Pauline Oliveros
Pauline and I both shared the feeling that this story is made for me to tell. I looked for many years for a subject about which to do my first feature length documentary. When my neighbor in upstate New York introduced me to Pauline, I knew I had found a subject that would inspire me throughout the inevitably lengthy process of making a film, and I also felt an instant obligation to share the story of this incomparable American icon. In the process of making this film, Pauline and I became close friends. Now that she has left this plane, I feel an even greater obligation to tell her story. I can think of few other people of the last century whose message of healing, unity and unbridled creative expression is more deeply needed at this time in American history.
I have dedicated my entire life since my early teens to music and filmmaking. In all those years, I never found a subject like Pauline Oliveros who provides me with such a perfect outlet for both passions. It is absolutely crucial, when making a film about someone to whom listening is the center of her personal and artistic world, that the filmmaker have a very advanced knowledge of music and sound recording and editing. I know that Pauline chose to work with me on this project because of my experience as a recording engineer as well as the use of sound in my films. In fact, in the time that I have been working on this film, I have also mixed a record for Pauline and Miya Masaoka, and recorded and mixed Pauline’s final record made with Nels Cline and Thollem McDonas. 
Finally, there is the practical side of the equation. I live only a few miles away from where Pauline lived in The Hudson Valley, and where her spouse of thirty years, Ione, still lives. I was able to track Pauline's career very closely and  spent countless hours with her over the nearly three years we worked together on this film. In the past year, I am blessed to have Ione offer me the same level of support and guidance I received from Pauline.

Why do you need so much money to finish a film?
Thanks to the generosity of my Indiegogo contributors and a grant from The Robert Bielecki Foundation, production on ""Deep Listening: The Story of Pauline Oliveros"" is complete. The production process was successful beyond all expectations. I interviewed over 30 people for the film, including: Pauline, Ione, Morton Subotnik, Tony Martin, Ramon Sender, Anna Halprin, Bert Turetsky, Claire Chase, Mark Dresser, Linda Montano, Miya Masaoka and many more incredible individuals. I have also scoured archives at Mills College, UCSD and NYU. I have had access to Pauline and Iones' personal archive as well as many generous archival contributions from others who worked and/or played with Pauline over the years. 
The end result of these past three years of work is that I have an astounding amount of material I now need to somehow distill into a two hour film. In my twenty years as an editor, this is the greatest challenge I have faced (just as I'm sure Pauline would want it!). 
The $35,000 being requested here is actually only a portion of what is needed to complete the film. If this fund drive can bring in more, it will only result in a better final product. Any remaining funding will be secured through traditional grants. 
Film post production is expensive. To begin with, we are looking at a minimum of two months of editing for which assistants will need to be hired. The production will also need to hire someone to secure rights for the huge amount of archival still images, film and sounds that will be in the documentary. In many cases, additional funding will be needed to pay for those rights and get hi-res copies of images and film. The last stages of post-production are color correction and sound mix. Each of those services cost a minimum of $10,000. Finally, if enough funding is secured, the filmmaker will hire a marketing expert to make sure the finished film is seen by as many people as possible. 
As Pauline herself wrote in 2007: “What, then, of my work do I hope will last? Well, what I am most interested in is not specific pieces surviving, but the understanding of Deep Listening and of the practices and processes that will lead to individual and collective creativity. That is what I would like to hand on.” We believe that this film can help in that noble pursuit. Please help us spend the time and energy needed to tell the story of this remarkable artist and her vibrant and varied career.
Any amount you can donate will be greatly appreciated. If you cannot donate money right now, then help us spread the word using the Indiegogo share tools. Finally, don’t forget to keep on listening!",3.0,3,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Home is a drama about family and belonging, set against a backdrop of contemporary political upheaval and a rising suspicion of migrants.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the EU referendum, Monica Carol – a Dutch-born woman – finds her sense of home and belonging thrown into jeopardy. As anti-immigrant sentiment festers around her and her two children, her estranged husband pressures her apply for citizenship before it’s too late. Headstrong and independent, Monica must deal with her own growing insecurity and the threat of Brexit to keep her family together, and ultimately makes a choice that will affect the future of her young family.</p>
<p>Though Home has this distinctly current and divisive political backdrop to it, the themes are much more universal: those of family and belonging. Its message is really that as strong as we think our foundations in a place are, they can be thrown into uncertainty at a moment’s notice. Ultimately the film attempts to depict the redemption that can be found in being part of a family, and that Home is not defined by where you live, but by the people you share it with.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As a team, we’re developing ""Home"" to illustrate our points of view on the contemporary political debate about migration and integration in the UK and in the European Union.

As a team of international students, many of whom came to the UK after the referendum, our personal struggles  and perspectives also inform part of the story.</p>

<h2><u><strong>Why a Film on Playback Theatre?</strong></u></h2>
</div><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/-tjpQn-1NIM?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><h3><strong>Mohan Rai, Director of Middleway Films</strong></h3><p>I am a filmmaker from the beautiful Himalayan country Nepal. I always look for stories that deserved to be told but are yet untold. The story of Playback Theatre is such a story. (Playback Theatre is an art form that was developed in the 1970s by Jonathan Fox and Jo Salas and that has since spread to more than 65 countries in the world. It's a theatre form that explores deeply the meaning of personal stories and helps us to connect, to build our communities, and to make this a better world.) It is one story that needs to be told, heard and watched.</p><p>What fascinate me most as a filmmaker is that the people who created and lived the Playback story will be in the film and will be telling the story in person, which is a rare happenstance. And also that the story is uniquely connected to my own country, my people, as Jonathan Fox spent two years in Nepal some 49 years back and had taken inspiration from here to develop this art form.</p><h3><strong>What the film will be like</strong></h3><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512563439/vwyggpez0kidohobiwgd.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p>In this documentary, I want to tell the story of Playback Theatre from its origins till today from the point of view of those who have lived it. I want to trace and creatively document Jonathan Fox and Jo Salas' journey of Playback Theatre - their journey of how the idea for Playback Theatre originated, their creative and organizational struggle and evolution as well as reflection in hindsight. The perspectives, experiences and memories of people from around the world will be important in determining how the story is told to make it accurate and authentic. It will be an expository, reflective and personal story of Playback Theatre.</p><p>For this, we want to shoot in locations that have special signification with reference to the story, such as the place where the idea of Playback Theatre struck Jonathan, the premise where the first rehearsals and performances took place, where they met group members and supporters. We also intend to cover some live moments in the Playback story as it unfolds such as Playback performances, trainings, workshops, gatherings etc. One occasion could be the celebration of 25 years of Playback Theatre in Japan in May 2018.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512564422/fgby3qowmsgoflpnyyxw.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>One part of the documentary’s story will be about Nepal, as one of the sources of inspiration for Jonathan, showing the rediscovery of the country after almost 50 years and the reflections of its meaning. However, the story will be told from its beginning in New York and other so-called “Western” countries to its journey back to “the East” in Tokyo, before it then returns back to “the West” or around the world. Finally, I want to cover the origin of an international Playback Theatre movement and its practice around the globe, its diversity and connectivity.</p><p>The documentary film project is a non-profit project with the goal to document and preserve the history and vision of Playback Theatre for the future. It will be feature length and in English.</p><h3><strong>About Middleway Films and the genesis of the idea of a Playback theatre documentary </strong></h3><p>Middleway Films is a Nepali Film Company that seeks out stories yet untold and makes films on issues and stories that matter for questioning and transforming societies. We have made documentary films on pressing issues in Nepal, such as the ten years of armed conflict and different forms of gender-based violence in a patriarchal Hindu society; some of these films have been selected for national and international film festivals. Importantly, since the beginning we have a strong focus on theatre and its role and contribution for transforming Nepali society. Since 2010 we have made about a dozen films about theatre in Nepal, gaining insights and specialized skills in making documentary films on theatre.</p><p>We have worked with the theatre and peace worker Anne Dirnstorfer on several projects since 2013. In 2015 we got the chance to make a documentary about the beginning of the Playback Theatre project “EnActing Dialogue”.  In 2016 she told me that one more documentary film was planned and that this time, Jonathan Fox would be coming to Nepal for training sessions.</p><p>When I was informed of Jonathan's involvement in the project, I began a preliminary YouTube research, trying to find out what films were already available about his life and the journey of the theatre approach. To my surprise, there was little and most of it was not comprehensive enough to give me an understanding of the story of Playback Theatre.</p><h3><strong>Why you should support this documentary film?</strong></h3><p>I don't think there are so many films around that tells the story of any art form--about how is was created, how it evolved and developed, and how is being practiced years after it was created, when the artists who created it are still alive and will be in the film. Filmmakers usually miss such an opportunity for many reasons. But fortunately for Playback Theatre we've got that opportunity now! And perhaps practically it's the only opportunity any filmmaker will get before it is late. The film will be a creative documentation of an art form but at the same time it will be a cinematic tribute to all who contributed to making what Playback Theatre is today—not least Jonathan Fox and Jo Salas. Your support can make this happen!</p><p>As Playback is so visual and aural, the film is the best medium to tell its story. Let's do it.</p><p>Please support, share and spread the word. The film can be made only with your support!</p><p> </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jmr-HhvI8WA?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div><p></p><h3><strong>Anne Dirnstorfer, Producer and ideal Supporter</strong></h3><p>When I first met him in 2015, just after Nepal had been hit by a major earthquake, I could see in Jonathan's eyes his unfinished story with Nepal. He still remembered some words and even parts of the typical Nepali body language came naturally when he asked me about my work in Nepal. When I suggested to him to come and work for the “Enacting Dialogue” project, he looked to the ground and said quietly: “Going to Nepal would be a big thing”.</p><p>At that point, there was no plan to make a documentary of that dimension. What happened is that when we started to cover Jonathan’s return to Nepal after almost 50 years, it was so interesting, that the filmmakers spontaneously decided that they would want to capture every single moment of his journey. From the beginning it was clear that this would be just a part of the bigger story.</p><p>What a thrilling idea to have Nepali filmmakers cover the story of Playback Theatre! Nepal is not a country with a long Playback tradition. Yet, in a mysterious way, something about Playback Theatre originated here.</p><p>Technically there are many advantages. Production costs for documentary making are relatively low in Nepal. The filmmakers are experts on how to cover stories of theatre visually. They have a kind of “neutral” and fresh view on the story as they are not Playback practitioners. Their motivation is genuine.</p><p>The work started on a voluntary basis and will stay a non-profit project. We are now searching for funding and donations to pay for travel costs, technical equipment as well as for basic payment to the filmmakers so that they are able to sustain themselves for the months of fulltime work. Please support us by spreading the idea and contribute in whatever way you can!</p><h3> </h3><h3>The Plan</h3><p>The shooting in Nepal was completed with our own resources in 2016 when Jonathan Fox visited the country.  </p><p>We plan to do the rest of the shooting in 2018, starting with US in March-April, in Japan in May and in the UK in September. </p><p>Editing of the film will be done from November 2018 to March 2019. </p><p>The film will be ready by April 2019. </p><h3>What will be the raised fund used for</h3><table align=""left"" border=""0"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0"" style=""width:588px;"" width=""734""><tbody>

Support from Playback Theatre Sydney

 
Why a Film on Playback Theatre?
Mohan Rai, Director of Middleway FilmsI am a filmmaker from the beautiful Himalayan country Nepal. I always look for stories that deserved to be told but are yet untold. The story of Playback Theatre is such a story. (Playback Theatre is an art form that was developed in the 1970s by Jonathan Fox and Jo Salas and that has since spread to more than 65 countries in the world. It's a theatre form that explores deeply the meaning of personal stories and helps us to connect, to build our communities, and to make this a better world.) It is one story that needs to be told, heard and watched.What fascinate me most as a filmmaker is that the people who created and lived the Playback story will be in the film and will be telling the story in person, which is a rare happenstance. And also that the story is uniquely connected to my own country, my people, as Jonathan Fox spent two years in Nepal some 49 years back and had taken inspiration from here to develop this art form.What the film will be likeIn this documentary, I want to tell the story of Playback Theatre from its origins till today from the point of view of those who have lived it. I want to trace and creatively document Jonathan Fox and Jo Salas' journey of Playback Theatre - their journey of how the idea for Playback Theatre originated, their creative and organizational struggle and evolution as well as reflection in hindsight. The perspectives, experiences and memories of people from around the world will be important in determining how the story is told to make it accurate and authentic. It will be an expository, reflective and personal story of Playback Theatre.For this, we want to shoot in locations that have special signification with reference to the story, such as the place where the idea of Playback Theatre struck Jonathan, the premise where the first rehearsals and performances took place, where they met group members and supporters. We also intend to cover some live moments in the Playback story as it unfolds such as Playback performances, trainings, workshops, gatherings etc. One occasion could be the celebration of 25 years of Playback Theatre in Japan in May 2018.One part of the documentary’s story will be about Nepal, as one of the sources of inspiration for Jonathan, showing the rediscovery of the country after almost 50 years and the reflections of its meaning. However, the story will be told from its beginning in New York and other so-called “Western” countries to its journey back to “the East” in Tokyo, before it then returns back to “the West” or around the world. Finally, I want to cover the origin of an international Playback Theatre movement and its practice around the globe, its diversity and connectivity.The documentary film project is a non-profit project with the goal to document and preserve the history and vision of Playback Theatre for the future. It will be feature length and in English.About Middleway Films and the genesis of the idea of a Playback theatre documentary Middleway Films is a Nepali Film Company that seeks out stories yet untold and makes films on issues and stories that matter for questioning and transforming societies. We have made documentary films on pressing issues in Nepal, such as the ten years of armed conflict and different forms of gender-based violence in a patriarchal Hindu society; some of these films have been selected for national and international film festivals. Importantly, since the beginning we have a strong focus on theatre and its role and contribution for transforming Nepali society. Since 2010 we have made about a dozen films about theatre in Nepal, gaining insights and specialized skills in making documentary films on theatre.We have worked with the theatre and peace worker Anne Dirnstorfer on several projects since 2013. In 2015 we got the chance to make a documentary about the beginning of the Playback Theatre project “EnActing Dialogue”.  In 2016 she told me that one more documentary film was planned and that this time, Jonathan Fox would be coming to Nepal for training sessions.When I was informed of Jonathan's involvement in the project, I began a preliminary YouTube research, trying to find out what films were already available about his life and the journey of the theatre approach. To my surprise, there was little and most of it was not comprehensive enough to give me an understanding of the story of Playback Theatre.Why you should support this documentary film?I don't think there are so many films around that tells the story of any art form--about how is was created, how it evolved and developed, and how is being practiced years after it was created, when the artists who created it are still alive and will be in the film. Filmmakers usually miss such an opportunity for many reasons. But fortunately for Playback Theatre we've got that opportunity now! And perhaps practically it's the only opportunity any filmmaker will get before it is late. The film will be a creative documentation of an art form but at the same time it will be a cinematic tribute to all who contributed to making what Playback Theatre is today—not least Jonathan Fox and Jo Salas. Your support can make this happen!As Playback is so visual and aural, the film is the best medium to tell its story. Let's do it.Please support, share and spread the word. The film can be made only with your support! Anne Dirnstorfer, Producer and ideal SupporterWhen I first met him in 2015, just after Nepal had been hit by a major earthquake, I could see in Jonathan's eyes his unfinished story with Nepal. He still remembered some words and even parts of the typical Nepali body language came naturally when he asked me about my work in Nepal. When I suggested to him to come and work for the “Enacting Dialogue” project, he looked to the ground and said quietly: “Going to Nepal would be a big thing”.At that point, there was no plan to make a documentary of that dimension. What happened is that when we started to cover Jonathan’s return to Nepal after almost 50 years, it was so interesting, that the filmmakers spontaneously decided that they would want to capture every single moment of his journey. From the beginning it was clear that this would be just a part of the bigger story.What a thrilling idea to have Nepali filmmakers cover the story of Playback Theatre! Nepal is not a country with a long Playback tradition. Yet, in a mysterious way, something about Playback Theatre originated here.Technically there are many advantages. Production costs for documentary making are relatively low in Nepal. The filmmakers are experts on how to cover stories of theatre visually. They have a kind of “neutral” and fresh view on the story as they are not Playback practitioners. Their motivation is genuine.The work started on a voluntary basis and will stay a non-profit project. We are now searching for funding and donations to pay for travel costs, technical equipment as well as for basic payment to the filmmakers so that they are able to sustain themselves for the months of fulltime work. Please support us by spreading the idea and contribute in whatever way you can! The PlanThe shooting in Nepal was completed with our own resources in 2016 when Jonathan Fox visited the country.  We plan to do the rest of the shooting in 2018, starting with US in March-April, in Japan in May and in the UK in September. Editing of the film will be done from November 2018 to March 2019. The film will be ready by April 2019. What will be the raised fund used for

                    The total cost of the project doesn't look modest though it is actually modest. This is because a large chunk of the total budget will be used to cover logistical costs, which are high because the shooting involves travelling to and shooting in three countries (UK, Japan and UK). Travelling to these countries is necessary to cover the international dimension of the Playback Theatre movement. Should the fund exceed this targeted amount, we will use the extra fund to organize a premiere for the documentary film in Nepal, pay submission fees for sending the film to film festivals and even consider shooting in one more country.Risks and ChallengesShooting in foreign countries with a small crew without a dedicated local support crew and on shoestring budget is definitely not an easy job. But we want to take up the challenge. Another challenge is financial. We are a relatively small company with limited resources. We have already completed the shooting in Nepal for the film with our own resources and are not in a position to put more resources in the project. However, if we cannot raise enough funds, then we are ready to further cut down on our already very modest remuneration or even work completely voluntarily. About the TeamAnne DirnstorferProducerAnne Dirnstorfer is a theatre activist and peace worker.

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I'm Matthew Price, writer and director of The End of Something. I've been working in the film industry for over 4 years now, and along the way I've learned, grown, made friends and formed a family (The second white circle is my Producer and best friend Connor ) that wants the same thing as me. Making great film.  The End of Something is about telling a story everyone can relate to, the transition from one phase to the next. It's personal to all of us because that's exactly what we are trying to do. With this short film we hope to gain the attention to further tell more engaging, entertaining, and enriching stories. </p>

<h3>Our History</h3>
<p>My friends and I have been creating crappy short films for a while. We have two youtube channels, a former company, and a website to back us up. <br/><br/><strong>Red Dot Cinema:</strong>  Our most successful channel.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We've combined our resources and know how of filmmaking and decided that in order to make the best film we can make of this 15 page script we need  $8,000. This will cover paying the crew (most importantly feeding them), locations, wardrobe, equipment, and processing the 16mm film we'll be shooting on. <br/>In return, you'll receive the thing we can offer best, ourselves.  Incentives run anywhere from a special thanks on our social media pages, an amazing BTS package complete with video, photo, signed scrapbook, a digital copy of the soundtrack (composed by Gabriel Ovalle our DP), all the way to offering a free shoot with us. In other words, we really appreciate the help. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The End of Something could actually be a beginning. We have been making films for the past few years in between all of our set work. Two of them have gotten into festivals, one even got picked up for distribution. This project could be thing that allows us to tell the stories we need to tell. Fun blockbusters run everything in theaters and important social/art films rule everything on the other spectrum. We're just trying to find that sweet spot of well made films that entertain, you don't see that as much anymore. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It's filmmaking. That in itself is a risky venture. Even if we  get the funding we could lose locations, equipment rental could be late, equipment can break or be lost, actors could quit, things could be stolen, etc. etc.  The reassurance here is that we all have dealt with every single one of these scenarios and more multiple times, and because of that, we are confident that we can handle any curve balls that come our way during production.</p>

<h3>Artist Statement</h3>
<p>The film's idea was developed with the intent to create a surreal and cinematic world that explores the themes of narcissism and the insecurities in the mind of a creative. Our target audience are those who would enjoy exploring the path of an artist struggling to deal with writer's block while also attempting to present their own perception of what an intellectual should look and act like. The film's tone magnifies the absurdity of everyday life by giving power to its minor characters and revealing moments of the main character's sensitivity. Through the lens of the cinematography, the film will be filled with bold colors and cinematic images that will reveal the power of The Beauty of it All.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why We Need Your Help!</h3>
<p>As two young independent filmmakers, Theo Gray and Johnny Chisholm are dedicated to creating stories that stimulate their audience through creative content and cinematic imagery. The Beauty of it All strives to do both, as it plays out in a world that never stops unfolding.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, making a film is expensive, and we need resources to make the world we imagine come to life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our goal is 5,000 dollars. The majority of the money will go towards the equipment that will allow us to create a particular look for the film. We are confident in our technical abilities to create a world that we imagine through the means of lighting and lenses. Your investment won't just stop at the Beauty of it All, it will provide us with equipment for our whole independent filmmaking careers. Allowing us to continue creating films that we are dedicated to an extremely passionate about! Your donation will always live on and will be the foundation for making our goals come true.</li>
<li>Being young filmmakers, we are very aware that we won't make money from our films, but the substituted currency that we take very seriously is recognition. Recognition for a young artist can be the fuel that pushes them forward. The platform that gives that to us is film festivals. They provide the opportunity to show people our stories and all the sweat and tears that went into our films. This is big as it can open up new connections and possible opportunities that can further our careers as filmmakers. But film festivals are expensive and we need all the help to submit our film to future festivals that will allow people to see all the hard work we've put into, The Beauty of it All.     </li>
<li>Lastly, we have several actors and extras in our film, and being so, we have to supply water and food for everyone. Plus transportation to locations. A full and hydrated crew is a happy crew.</li>

<p>The Beauty of it All strives on localism. We believe a film should hire from local talent.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>""Occupation Rainfall"" is one of Australia's largest independent feature films ever attempted. </p>
<p>Following on from the 2018 release of ' Occupation' - <i>An ambitious film, where Aliens invade Australia and we follow a group of people from a small town as they fight back</i> - the production team moved forward with a bigger, bolder and fresher sequel to continue the story. </p>

</h2><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p>Over the Easter weekend of 2020 the three friends Markos, Maria and Jokas come together on the island of Aegina in Greece. The three of them come from very different backgrounds* but evenly share a deep frustration over recent life events and the notions of late adolescence. During a night out, they start getting to each other and as they fail to control their emotions they spiral into escalation. The events leave them questioning their lives and identities. In a search for meaning all three find new ways to express and free themselves, one more, one less, and one maybe not all.</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583949310/y7da7x5evu7hxsnopjph.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>""In conclusion to my education, I  decided to make a very personal film that attempts to investigate the relationships between my closest friends, in a place I am lucky enough to call home.""</i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>- Julian</i></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583946848/p3fvivtzvvct05ffy0cr.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Intention Note</u></h2><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p>As my formal education in film will come to an end with this project,  I decided to dwell deep into the matters that concern me most, the things that make me who I am, as a person and inevitably also as a filmmaker. I have travelled to Greece every year since I was born. My father has worked there for most of his life as an archaeologist. Its is like a second home to me, a home which has taught me more about myself than any other place I can safely call such. Meraki is a Docudrama based around the events of the Easter weekend of 2020. The story involves three of my closest friends and their struggle for purpose and identity, oftentimes citing real-life events. All of them are from Greece or currently live there and as such, they are playing themselves. The camera will stay strictly observatory and fluctuate between handheld and tripod coverage to maintain a fiction film aesthetic. The film will be accompanied by contemporary and colourful rhythms of the London jazz scene. Sound and Image will reflect the themes and methodology of Liminality. Liminality is a sociological concept which describes the process of the rite of passage, a threshold space often encountered when confronted with change and especially relevant in late adolescents.  I have undergone periods of rapid change at a constant capacity, learning, readapting and coming to terms with my own liminality is the main motivation behind making this film. It is an attempt to reflect critically upon notions of identity, by connecting all my dots, my places, my people and our stories.   </p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583946963/dndrw6drfeggzey72eju.jpg"" src=""""/>   </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Crew</u></h2><p> </p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Director</u></h3><p style=""text-align: center;"">JULIAN SCHWANDNER</p><p>Julian graduated with a first-class honours degree in Film &amp; TV Production from the University of Greenwich in July 2019.

 Over the Easter weekend of 2020 the three friends Markos, Maria and Jokas come together on the island of Aegina in Greece. The three of them come from very different backgrounds* but evenly share a deep frustration over recent life events and the notions of late adolescence. During a night out, they start getting to each other and as they fail to control their emotions they spiral into escalation. The events leave them questioning their lives and identities. In a search for meaning all three find new ways to express and free themselves, one more, one less, and one maybe not all.  ""In conclusion to my education, I  decided to make a very personal film that attempts to investigate the relationships between my closest friends, in a place I am lucky enough to call home.""- Julian Intention Note As my formal education in film will come to an end with this project,  I decided to dwell deep into the matters that concern me most, the things that make me who I am, as a person and inevitably also as a filmmaker. I have travelled to Greece every year since I was born. My father has worked there for most of his life as an archaeologist. Its is like a second home to me, a home which has taught me more about myself than any other place I can safely call such. Meraki is a Docudrama based around the events of the Easter weekend of 2020. The story involves three of my closest friends and their struggle for purpose and identity, oftentimes citing real-life events. All of them are from Greece or currently live there and as such, they are playing themselves. The camera will stay strictly observatory and fluctuate between handheld and tripod coverage to maintain a fiction film aesthetic. The film will be accompanied by contemporary and colourful rhythms of the London jazz scene. Sound and Image will reflect the themes and methodology of Liminality. Liminality is a sociological concept which describes the process of the rite of passage, a threshold space often encountered when confronted with change and especially relevant in late adolescents.  I have undergone periods of rapid change at a constant capacity, learning, readapting and coming to terms with my own liminality is the main motivation behind making this film. It is an attempt to reflect critically upon notions of identity, by connecting all my dots, my places, my people and our stories.       Crew DirectorJULIAN SCHWANDNERJulian graduated with a first-class honours degree in Film & TV Production from the University of Greenwich in July 2019. The second year of his bachelor programme he spent at the Film & TV faculty of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague. He is currently undergoing a Master program in Audiovisual Arts - Film Directing at LUCA School of Arts in Brussels in Belgium. The Prague based short film ""Rost"" saw Julian win the award for best director at the 2018 SE10 Student Film Festival in London. His graduate project ""Hiraeth"" won five out of nine honours at the School of Design degree show of Greenwich University in 2019. This includes his personal honour for the best-directed film of the year.  Cinematography NIKOS NIKOLOPOULOSNikos is a Greek Director and Cinematographer based in Athens. He studied film direction at the Hellenic Cinema and Television School Stavrakos as well as photography at the Leica Academy in Athens. His debut feature film POLK was premiered at the 55th Thessaloniki International Film Festival in 2014 where it received the FIPRESCI special mention award. His work as a photographer has been widely recognised and published in The New York Times, The Rolling Stone, Positif, American Cinematographer and  Cahiers du Cinema.  MontageHELOîSE FERLAYHeloïse Ferlay is a French animator who studies at the École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs (ENSAD) in Paris.

Archlight Studios is a Mid-West based production company co-founded by Jason Contini and Nicholas J. Hearne.  Not only have we been very active in film production for over ten years, but we have also been active in the world of comic book publishing as well.  However this is not the first time we have melded the two (comics and films).  Our previous full length feature film, FOUR COLOR EULOGY, dealt with a young struggling comic book writer forced to return home to care for his ailing mother.  The film features a number of comic book references and has been called ""a more dramatic Kevin Smith film"".  The film premiered in 2016 and had a very successful theatrical run before coming to DVD.  

For more on this film including trailers and background go to the FOUR COLOR EULOGY website or FOUR COLOR EULOGY Facebook Page.
In addition to the feature, Archlight Studios also produced a music video for Taylor Pietz's original single ""Color Me"" which featured as the opening theme song of the film.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><strong>A 15-minute comedy short film, great production values, a quirky and surreal script with a female protagonist, produced and supported by a female-led team.</strong> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">*NEW* Stay up to date with the filming and production by <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/appetite_comedyshortfilm/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">following us on instagram</a>!</p>
<p>My name is Kat. I am a German actress and the producer of this short film. Last October my partner and I heard a story on the radio about a man in the US who went on a series of dinner dates with women and always ran out when the bill came. The police got him, and the story was so strange that it made the news:</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/12/paul-guadalupe-gonzales-dine-and-dash-dater-court"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/12/paul-guadalupe-gonzales-dine-and-dash-dater-court</a></p>
<p>We immediately thought the story had potential for a dark comedy, and started thinking about whether a woman could play the role of the man running out on the dates. </p>
<p>That's how we came up with our main character, Steph. Think Villanelle, from <i>Killing Eve</i>, only she doesn't kill people, she just leaves them broke. She doesn’t like to conform to society’s rules. She’s conceited, anarchic and destructive in the pursuit of something that eludes and frustrates her. What's more, she gets weirder and more daring as the film goes on. </p>
<p>Through a mixture of surreal elements, montage, snappy interrupted dialogue and the film’s Wes Anderson-inspired aesthetic, the audience gets to know Steph’s pretty narcissistic idea of herself in a world she’s creating and quickly burning to the ground.</p>
<p>Our talented cast includes some acting 'royalty'. Playing two of the luckless guys are Alexander Tol (seen in the teaser), from the series ""Victoria"", and Philip Andrew who stars in the series ""The Spanish Princess"".</p>

</div></div>","Summary
A 15-minute comedy short film, great production values, a quirky and surreal script with a female protagonist, produced and supported by a female-led team. 
*NEW* Stay up to date with the filming and production by following us on instagram!
My name is Kat. I am a German actress and the producer of this short film. Last October my partner and I heard a story on the radio about a man in the US who went on a series of dinner dates with women and always ran out when the bill came. The police got him, and the story was so strange that it made the news:
https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/sep/12/paul-guadalupe-gonzales-dine-and-dash-dater-court
We immediately thought the story had potential for a dark comedy, and started thinking about whether a woman could play the role of the man running out on the dates. 
That's how we came up with our main character, Steph. Think Villanelle, from Killing Eve, only she doesn't kill people, she just leaves them broke. She doesn’t like to conform to society’s rules. She’s conceited, anarchic and destructive in the pursuit of something that eludes and frustrates her. What's more, she gets weirder and more daring as the film goes on. 
Through a mixture of surreal elements, montage, snappy interrupted dialogue and the film’s Wes Anderson-inspired aesthetic, the audience gets to know Steph’s pretty narcissistic idea of herself in a world she’s creating and quickly burning to the ground.
Our talented cast includes some acting 'royalty'. Playing two of the luckless guys are Alexander Tol (seen in the teaser), from the series ""Victoria"", and Philip Andrew who stars in the series ""The Spanish Princess"".

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our documentary explores the environmental, political and sociological impacts of the food industry in the UK. We aim to explore the facts on consumption trends and the flaws they bring while simultaneously looking towards the future of food production and those who seek to change it. The Uk has shown growing concern over major subjects such as global warming, international relations &amp; unsustainable energy. Our documentary hopes to show viewers what role they play in the world and how a change in their actions can help make a better tomorrow.</p>
<p>Come with us through this journey, where we will show you the revolutionaries of the UK food market and how they are changing the system for the better. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We are asking for a budget of £1500 in order to achieve the best quality of filming and content possible! Of course with a flexible campaign, all of your money will be used to the best of our ability to create something stunning. </p>
<p>We are using the funding for : </p>
<ul>
<li>Traveling through Manchester, London, Oxford, Edinburg &amp; all the small farming communities in between. </li>
<li>Interviewees and personnel that helped along the way </li>
<li>As a documentary that focuses on the environmental and agricultural challenges faced, we are wanting to create a carbon and wastage neutral documentary (or as close as it possibly gets). For this, we need your help, in order to balance the scales and make something good for you and good for the planet.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It is a challenge to make a documentary that wishes to take on such huge corporations however once we can openly show this documentary, we want to be able to do it freely without any ties from anything, by doing this, we could show and spread this doc as far and wide, thanks to you. </p>
<p>You will be investing in a documentary that is focused on showing you a little more about this industry, we are committed to reach more knowledge to the viewers. Knowledge is power and hopefully, this will change with your help.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We understand that your money is in our hands, and you are helping us achieve our dreams. Naturally many things can happen, however even if we don't achieve the budget we are still able to work with a smaller amount of money and create a lower budget version of the project. The main difficulties would be reaching the more remote areas for our documentary and these travel expenses however we would get around these issues!</p>

<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>Producer: Bruna Deusdado </p>
<p>“Being the producer of this project is something I have been building up for the last 3 years in this university course. Producing is my calling, have been doing it since I was 16 in different areas ranging from television programs, to short films, it has all culminated to this project, as Documentaries are my passion, and so is the environment and agriculture, I am excited to put everything aside and make this project the best it can be”</p>
<p>Director: Daniel Cubello</p>
<p>“For the past 3 years, I’ve had a strong passion for making documentaries. Their way of showing real-life experiences shows just how powerful documentary is as an art form. I’ve directed multiple films and documentaries throughout my time at university and feel that I’ve gained real skills within my role that will be able to take this production to the next level.”</p>
<p>Sound Designer: Ben Delaney</p>
<p>“Having been involved in sound design for the past 3 years of this course, I feel like my skills have developed to a point where I can confidently say I am proficient in the area. The films I've perfectly worked have been predominantly fiction but I’ve hungered to work on a documentary that has captivated me with a topic that I’m honestly interested in and feel like this project has accomplished that.”</p>
<p>Editor: Klaudia Cichocka </p>
<p>“I’ve been editing since I was 16 from residential courses to university work and feel as though these last 3 years have really helped me gain a greater understanding of what works and how to tie a story together. Despite having taken a large break this past year from editing major pieces I’ve continued to practice in my spare time and feel I am ready to work on something large scale. I’m excited to work on a documentary relating to social issues and our world today, the topic is fascinating and I think with my editing I can pull together an engaging narrative that will leave a lasting impact on audiences”</p>

<p>Just Bake Cookies is the coming of age story of a young man named Quinton and his struggle to navigate his way from teen to manhood. We meet Quinton in high school as he saves another kid from being bullied by beating the assailants. Quinton's Grandfather, Pops has been raising Quinton ever since his mother passed away from Cancer a few years earlier. Pops is very wise and loving but has a hard time helping Quinton keep his anger in check. Pops comes to the realization that he needs reinforcements to rein in his well-meaning but ultimately undisciplined grandson. He enrolls Quinton in a local Kung Fu school and through his martial arts training, Quinton finds himself. Fast forward a few years later. Quinton has transitioned nicely into a good man and is now a Mixed Martial Arts world champion. However, Pops has developed Alzheimer's disease. Throughout Quinton's life, he's faced many challenging obstacles. His Grandfather's illness may be the toughest yet. Just Bake Cookies was written by Quinn Early and is directed by his son Cameron Early. The two have been able to share some amazing experiences together working as stuntmen on several movies and TV shows such as, Bright, S.W.A.T. and Seal Team. Just Bake Cookies is based on their relationship. Quinn's mother Ann Early was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2008 and passed away in 2013. Just Bake Cookies will also be used as a vehicle to raise money and bring awareness to this horrible disease that ultimately took Ann's life.</p>
<p>With your help, we'll be able to create an amazing film that will help raise money to stop Alzheimer's, which effects so many people.</p>
<p>The risks of the success of this project are as follows: The success of Just Bake Cookies will depend on the funding that we receive. We'll  begin filming in March, 2020. The casting is set and we have secured locations. The funding of the project will help get us to the finish line. </p>

<h3>About the Film</h3>
<p>Honey is a swing-jazz-loving, well-mannered, plant-loving witch. She makes honey pot potions to give her friends and neighbors a better day at work, or a little luck with love, whatever they need! However, her delivery boy Chester is a complete killjoy. He thinks she's a snake oil salesman and delivers her potions with as much enthusiasm as a dead slug. Honey, after consulting her familiar (a honeysuckle plant named Eleanora), decides to concoct a spell to make him sweeter: Miss Honey's Patented Sweetener Spell to be exact! Unfortunately, Chester isn't taking it. When Honey decides to have him over for tea as a last-ditch effort to give him the spell, things get a little out of hand and Honey reveals her real witch side.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Director's Note</h3>
<p>Hello everyone! My name is Chloë Williams, and I am a West Virginian writer and director. I wrote Honey because I wanted to create something fun to make, and fun to watch. Honey has become such a vivid character to me. She practically jumps off of the page! My crew and I are so excited to bring her and her wild adventure to life through your generous donations. I know you'll fall in love with her 50's style and eccentric wit, and maybe you'll even come to love grumpy ol' Chester as well. (We already know you'll like Eleanora. She's a really neat plant.)</p>
<p>My crew and I are extremely passionate about and dedicated to this project. We are proud to boast our all-female above-the-line team. However, we are also very proud of the rest of our crew, all of whom are talented, go-getters. I couldn't be happier with the group we have for this production. Now all we need is you. Your financial support will ensure that this project is able to get off of the ground and onto the big screen. My team and I thank you in advance for your kind support.</p>

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>Every superhero has an origin story, detailing how they gained their powers and decided to fight crime; and Kenya Cole (the protagonist of this story) is no different. </p>
<p>Following a savage beating at the hands of a group of racist thugs, who have been emboldened by the Brexit vote, Kenya uses the experimental super soldier enhancement implant created by a generous engineer to exact revenge on her attackers and the shadowy organisation behind it all. </p>
<p>Set against the backdrop of Brexit in present-day South London, United Kingdom, and utilising a limited number of realistic practical sets and outdoor locations, with trained stunt professionals and no need for major special effects, “KENYA” could be made on a conservative budget. </p>
<p>“KENYA” is a gritty, urban saga of prejudice and murder, human weakness and female empowerment. It’s a hyper-realistic superhero tale of one woman’s struggle to escape her own limitations and unleash her true potential. </p>

Monocacy is a personal work of award-winning and local Frederick County, Maryland filmmaker Lincoln Robisch.  With this film, he and his production team wishes to showcase how neurodivergent individuals navigate relationships and are often negatively treated in the culture of rural high schools in America. </p><h2><strong>DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT </strong></h2><p>Monocacy, in one form or another, has been on my mind for the better part of 3 years. It is a story rooted in a conglomeration of my childhood experiences and is easily my most personal work to date. Our purpose in making the film is to shed a light on the experiences of those on the Autism spectrum within the culture of rural high schools in America today. The fictional Monocacy High School, of which the majority of the picture will take place in, represents a concoction of characteristics uniquely specific to our times. Our neurodivergent lead, Emmanuel, struggles to maintain a simple friendship amidst the school’s tumultuous environment of anti-political correctness. </p><p>Much of my approach to tackling this subject has been informed by my experiences growing up as a sibling of an older sister with Autism. I have had the opportunity to see up-close how the culture of our times impacts individuals like her. For this reason, this project is of the utmost importance to me. I feel it is essential that this film be made now so that we are able to fully confront the negative normalities of our current culture as it relates to those that are neurodivergent. I hope you will assist us in this effort. Thank you.</p><div>

<h2>
<strong>The Impact -</strong> </h2>
<h3>What is Asperger's Syndrome? </h3>
<p>In 2013, Asperger's syndrome (AS) became categorized as an<strong> autism spectrum disorder (ASD)</strong>. This disorder's characteristics include<strong> impaired social interactions and limited repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and activities</strong>. Motor skills may also be delayed, but <strong>strong verbal language skills and intellectual ability </strong>distinguish AS from other types of autism.</p>
<p>It is estimated that <strong>two out of every 10,000 children have the disorder</strong>. Boys are more likely than girls to be diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, but this could be because girls with AS are often overlooked or misdiagnosed.</p>
<p>With this film, our goal is to increase awareness, understanding, and acceptance of such individuals among the autism spectrum.  </p>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p><strong>Acknowledgment of the COVID-19 Outbreak</strong> </p>
<p>Our production team is working in an abundance of caution to address the many risks associated with this film--especially while planning to film at this point in 2020. In order to shoot in August, we would need to at least be in Phase Two of the CDC’s “Opening Up America Again” guidelines. At this point, groups of 50 people or less will be allowed as long as distancing and sanitation protocols are enforced. We will ONLY follow through with these dates if the trajectory of the virus and the statistics in the area deem it safe to do so. If the trajectory and statistics say otherwise, we will move the dates.</p>
<p>Part of our distancing and sanitation guidelines will include: providing masks to everyone on set, individually-packing meals, placing hand-sanitation stations in convenient and commonly used areas, purchasing a contactless thermometer for daily temperature readings upon every person’s arrival to set, and of course, enforcing social distancing guidelines.</p>
<p>This on-set protocol has been developed through the research of professional sets that have either begun filming in various parts of the world, or of production companies which have laid out their plans for when their productions DO start filming again. </p>
<p>Every donation will help to carry out this protocol, thus providing a safer and healthier set.</p>

Monocacy is a personal work of award-winning and local Frederick County, Maryland filmmaker Lincoln Robisch.  With this film, he and his production team wishes to showcase how neurodivergent individuals navigate relationships and are often negatively treated in the culture of rural high schools in America. DIRECTOR’S STATEMENT Monocacy, in one form or another, has been on my mind for the better part of 3 years. It is a story rooted in a conglomeration of my childhood experiences and is easily my most personal work to date. Our purpose in making the film is to shed a light on the experiences of those on the Autism spectrum within the culture of rural high schools in America today. The fictional Monocacy High School, of which the majority of the picture will take place in, represents a concoction of characteristics uniquely specific to our times. Our neurodivergent lead, Emmanuel, struggles to maintain a simple friendship amidst the school’s tumultuous environment of anti-political correctness. Much of my approach to tackling this subject has been informed by my experiences growing up as a sibling of an older sister with Autism. I have had the opportunity to see up-close how the culture of our times impacts individuals like her. For this reason, this project is of the utmost importance to me. I feel it is essential that this film be made now so that we are able to fully confront the negative normalities of our current culture as it relates to those that are neurodivergent. I hope you will assist us in this effort. Thank you.

The Impact - 
What is Asperger's Syndrome? 
In 2013, Asperger's syndrome (AS) became categorized as an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This disorder's characteristics include impaired social interactions and limited repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, and activities. Motor skills may also be delayed, but strong verbal language skills and intellectual ability distinguish AS from other types of autism.
It is estimated that two out of every 10,000 children have the disorder. Boys are more likely than girls to be diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, but this could be because girls with AS are often overlooked or misdiagnosed.
With this film, our goal is to increase awareness, understanding, and acceptance of such individuals among the autism spectrum.

Risks & Challenges
Acknowledgment of the COVID-19 Outbreak 
Our production team is working in an abundance of caution to address the many risks associated with this film--especially while planning to film at this point in 2020. In order to shoot in August, we would need to at least be in Phase Two of the CDC’s “Opening Up America Again” guidelines. At this point, groups of 50 people or less will be allowed as long as distancing and sanitation protocols are enforced. We will ONLY follow through with these dates if the trajectory of the virus and the statistics in the area deem it safe to do so. If the trajectory and statistics say otherwise, we will move the dates.
Part of our distancing and sanitation guidelines will include: providing masks to everyone on set, individually-packing meals, placing hand-sanitation stations in convenient and commonly used areas, purchasing a contactless thermometer for daily temperature readings upon every person’s arrival to set, and of course, enforcing social distancing guidelines.
This on-set protocol has been developed through the research of professional sets that have either begun filming in various parts of the world, or of production companies which have laid out their plans for when their productions DO start filming again. 
Every donation will help to carry out this protocol, thus providing a safer and healthier set.

</ul><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>Apollospace, LLC holds tens of thousands of raw public domain Apollo era digital mission images, representing the highest resolution scans NASA has made from original film.  These raw images have been, and continue to be, restored, corrected, and enhanced for public distribution and enjoyment, as well as featuring them in our “Apollo Reflections” series.</p><p>I have had an interest in space since I was too young to read – drawing pictures of rockets and planets on my walls.  I grew up watching the Gemini and Apollo Program missions and dreaming of one day venturing into space myself.  While that didn’t work out quite like I’d hoped, my passion for space exploration compelled me to amass a large collection astronaut autographs and space photos, and later to create Apollospace.  From approximately 1996 through 2007, I ran and operated Apollospace as a DBA/ sole proprietorship.  I traveled extensively to various NASA Regional Planetary Image Facilities to review the complete library of Apollo photographs and select the most iconic and compelling images, for which I acquired inter-negatives of those images through NASA, and produced and sold 8×10 photographs from those negatives on the Apollospace website for over ten years. </p><p>I sold thousands of signed and unsigned photographs to collectors around the world, including many I personally had signed by the astronauts themselves who took the photos or were featured in them.  That provided many opportunities to discuss Apollo era imagery with the people who were actually there, and provided valuable insight into how the photographs should look. </p><p>There have been a series of scans made of the Apollo photographs, most notably prior to the 40th anniversaries in 2009 and more recently as part of a Space Act Agreement with Arizona State University in preparation for the 50th anniversaries.  Apollospace acquired all the available ASU/JSC scans for this project.</p><p>The <a href=""https://apollospace.com/about-us/imaging-process/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Apollospace image process</a> page details the technical work of bringing these photographs to life.  But more than an historical record of one of the greatest accomplishments in human history, these images are art.   Each Apollo era photograph appearing on this site was taken by a human hand and with a human eye.  50 years later, each one been restored, corrected, and enhanced with a human eye as well, to be as visually pleasing as they are historically and naturally accurate.</p><p>Please help us bring these photos to life as described by Apollo Astronaut Tom Stafford, and others, by contributing to this campaign so we can complete our Apollo 10 related film and begin producing others in the series.  Please contribute to this project if you can and be part of, as well as help us preserve, the incredible history of Apollo and share this campaign with your friends.</p><p>Thank you,</p><p>Jeremy Theoret</p></div>","NOTE NEW PERK FOR EXECUTIVE PRODUCERS ONLY : 1/2 PIECE OF FLOWN KAPTON FOIL FROM THE APOLLO 9 LUNAR MODULE!OverviewThe most incredible Apollo images, fully restored at the highest resolution, are brought to life for our “Apollo Reflections” series – Beautiful 4K films featuring Apollo photography described by the men who were there.

BackgroundApollospace, LLC holds tens of thousands of raw public domain Apollo era digital mission images, representing the highest resolution scans NASA has made from original film.  These raw images have been, and continue to be, restored, corrected, and enhanced for public distribution and enjoyment, as well as featuring them in our “Apollo Reflections” series.I have had an interest in space since I was too young to read – drawing pictures of rockets and planets on my walls.  I grew up watching the Gemini and Apollo Program missions and dreaming of one day venturing into space myself.  While that didn’t work out quite like I’d hoped, my passion for space exploration compelled me to amass a large collection astronaut autographs and space photos, and later to create Apollospace.  From approximately 1996 through 2007, I ran and operated Apollospace as a DBA/ sole proprietorship.  I traveled extensively to various NASA Regional Planetary Image Facilities to review the complete library of Apollo photographs and select the most iconic and compelling images, for which I acquired inter-negatives of those images through NASA, and produced and sold 8×10 photographs from those negatives on the Apollospace website for over ten years. I sold thousands of signed and unsigned photographs to collectors around the world, including many I personally had signed by the astronauts themselves who took the photos or were featured in them.  That provided many opportunities to discuss Apollo era imagery with the people who were actually there, and provided valuable insight into how the photographs should look. There have been a series of scans made of the Apollo photographs, most notably prior to the 40th anniversaries in 2009 and more recently as part of a Space Act Agreement with Arizona State University in preparation for the 50th anniversaries.  Apollospace acquired all the available ASU/JSC scans for this project.The Apollospace image process page details the technical work of bringing these photographs to life.  But more than an historical record of one of the greatest accomplishments in human history, these images are art.   Each Apollo era photograph appearing on this site was taken by a human hand and with a human eye.  50 years later, each one been restored, corrected, and enhanced with a human eye as well, to be as visually pleasing as they are historically and naturally accurate.Please help us bring these photos to life as described by Apollo Astronaut Tom Stafford, and others, by contributing to this campaign so we can complete our Apollo 10 related film and begin producing others in the series.  Please contribute to this project if you can and be part of, as well as help us preserve, the incredible history of Apollo and share this campaign with your friends.Thank you,Jeremy Theoret",22.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>Mi nombre es Paco Soto, director de Rural Cops y administrador de la productora Cafetico Films, fundada junto con mi esposa Carol Colomer, recientemente fallecida. Su deseo era que este proyecto en el que tanta ilusión y empeño puso, se finalizara y saliera adelante, por lo que por ella y en su homenaje Rural Cops va adelante.</p>
<p>Rural Cops Es una comedia policíaca que se estructura en cortometraje, largometraje y ambos formatos conteniendo una versión alternativa e  interactiva, donde el espectador puede decidir lo que va a ocurrir en algunas de las secuencias.</p>
<p>Sinopsis: El Sheriff Michael Ballester lleva más de 30 años de servicio trabajando en colaboración con las diferentes policías en el mundo y decide viajar desde Los Ángeles (EEUU) a España, concretamente a la localidad de Torretatxell, junto con un equipo de reporteros del conocido reality “Rural Cops” con el objetivo de realizar un reportaje en profundidad de cómo es el día a día de este retén de Policía Local, llevándose el reportaje del año.</p>
<p>- El cortometraje se distribuirá por festivales de cine, tanto nacionales como internacionales.</p>
<p>- El largometraje se estrenará en salas comerciales y posterior venta de derechos a Tv. (dependiendo de la cantidad que se obtenga en la campaña, podremos costear mas o menos copias para su estreno en salas, deseando al menos un mínimos de 10 salas en todo el país).</p>
<p>- Versiones interactivas del cortometraje y largometraje estarán incluidas en el dvd/blu-ray y en los festivales de cine que así lo deseen, donde el público puede interactuar y ser partícipe de la película.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes</strong><br/>Necesitamos 21.700 euros para cubrir la fase final de postproducción y distribución del cortometraje, y embarcarnos en el largometraje. El resto de financiación está ya cubierto con los patrocinadores y colaboradores que a día de hoy están en el proyecto. Aquí los tienes:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.ruralcops.com/patrocinadores.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.ruralcops.com/patrocinadores.html</a></p>
<p>Con tu apoyo formarás parte de Rural Cops y obtendrás, dependiendo tu aportación, toda una serie de ventajas y recompensas, como incluirte en los créditos de la película, y el envío de tu camiseta, taza, dvd/blu-ray/copia digital, póster e invitación el día de su estreno.</p>

<p><strong>El impacto</strong></p>
<p>RURAL COPS es algo más que una película tradicional, ya que el proyecto está estructurado en un cortometraje, que será la antesala del largometraje, ambos con versiones interactivas.</p>
<p>Es un proyecto original, producible y que empatiza con el amplio público al que va destinado</p>
<p>RURAL COPS busca aumentar paulatinamente su presencia online publicando y promocionándose de forma constante, como una cuenta atrás, hasta el estreno de la película, marcando el ritmo paulatino del día a día y mostrando los avances del rodaje. </p>
<p>Se persigue organizar y programar las acciones de comunicación online, ofreciendo una imagen consistente y compacta: CREAR, AFIANZAR Y FIDELIZAR, GENERANDO ESPECTACIÓN en el futuro público que acudirá a las salas.</p>
<p>La propuesta presentada en formato de cortometraje, largometraje y versiones interactivas, enlazados entre sí y con el valor añadido de estar basado en hechos reales de las fuerzas y cuerpos de seguridad, no sólo llega al público en general, sino que los más de 324.000 miembros de las fuerzas y cuerpos de seguridad pueden sentirse identificados y empatizar con los personajes, lo que los convierte en potenciales espectadores y seguidores de RURAL COPS.</p>
<p>Conseguimos hace unos años sacar adelante nuestro primer largometraje crowdfunding OPERASIONES ESPESIALES , ahora llega el turno de RURAL COPS.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Reparto</strong></p>
<p>Contamos con un reparto de lujo: Ramón Langa, Pablo Pinedo, Javier Bódalo, Emilio Gavira, Manuel Serrato,Antonio Meléndez Peso, Lola Moltó, Juanma Ruiz, Sergio Brotons, Manuel Yañez, Laura Lemus y 250 figurantes.</p>

Sinopsis: El Sheriff Michael Ballester lleva más de 30 años de servicio trabajando en colaboración con las diferentes policías en el mundo y decide viajar desde Los Ángeles (EEUU) a España, concretamente a la localidad de Torretatxell, junto con un equipo de reporteros del conocido reality “Rural Cops” con el objetivo de realizar un reportaje en profundidad de cómo es el día a día de este retén de Policía Local, llevándose el reportaje del año.
- El cortometraje se distribuirá por festivales de cine, tanto nacionales como internacionales.
- El largometraje se estrenará en salas comerciales y posterior venta de derechos a Tv. (dependiendo de la cantidad que se obtenga en la campaña, podremos costear mas o menos copias para su estreno en salas, deseando al menos un mínimos de 10 salas en todo el país).
- Versiones interactivas del cortometraje y largometraje estarán incluidas en el dvd/blu-ray y en los festivales de cine que así lo deseen, donde el público puede interactuar y ser partícipe de la película.
 
Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienesNecesitamos 21.700 euros para cubrir la fase final de postproducción y distribución del cortometraje, y embarcarnos en el largometraje. El resto de financiación está ya cubierto con los patrocinadores y colaboradores que a día de hoy están en el proyecto. Aquí los tienes:
http://www.ruralcops.com/patrocinadores.html
Con tu apoyo formarás parte de Rural Cops y obtendrás, dependiendo tu aportación, toda una serie de ventajas y recompensas, como incluirte en los créditos de la película, y el envío de tu camiseta, taza, dvd/blu-ray/copia digital, póster e invitación el día de su estreno.

Y si tienes una empresa o negocio y deseas que aparezca en la versión del largometraje tu producto que será visto por miles de espectadores en un entorno tan valorado como el cine, estás a tiempo.

 
El impacto
RURAL COPS es algo más que una película tradicional, ya que el proyecto está estructurado en un cortometraje, que será la antesala del largometraje, ambos con versiones interactivas.
Es un proyecto original, producible y que empatiza con el amplio público al que va destinado
RURAL COPS busca aumentar paulatinamente su presencia online publicando y promocionándose de forma constante, como una cuenta atrás, hasta el estreno de la película, marcando el ritmo paulatino del día a día y mostrando los avances del rodaje. 
Se persigue organizar y programar las acciones de comunicación online, ofreciendo una imagen consistente y compacta: CREAR, AFIANZAR Y FIDELIZAR, GENERANDO ESPECTACIÓN en el futuro público que acudirá a las salas.
La propuesta presentada en formato de cortometraje, largometraje y versiones interactivas, enlazados entre sí y con el valor añadido de estar basado en hechos reales de las fuerzas y cuerpos de seguridad, no sólo llega al público en general, sino que los más de 324.000 miembros de las fuerzas y cuerpos de seguridad pueden sentirse identificados y empatizar con los personajes, lo que los convierte en potenciales espectadores y seguidores de RURAL COPS.
Conseguimos hace unos años sacar adelante nuestro primer largometraje crowdfunding OPERASIONES ESPESIALES , ahora llega el turno de RURAL COPS.

Moths and Locusts & Damo Suzuki . Signed with a signed photo also. (Photo as seen in Limited Edition Photo Print Perk - I will have these signed by Damo also to make it fair!)""On a warm night in June 2013 Damo set down in Nanaimo, BC for an epic night of long heavy space rock jams in front of a rabid sold-out crowd. Two synth stations, fuzzed-out guitars, three drummers and pummeling bass coalesced behind Damo's commanding presence, the result was a sprawling, transcendent, seamless soundscape. Backed by Moths & Locusts and joined by members of Wolf Parade, and Colliding Canyons.'""  VIDEO UPDATE  8.06.2018 ENERGYA DOCUMENTARY ABOUT DAMO SUZUKI  ‘Energy: Damo Suzuki’In 2014 legendary musician Damo Suzuki was diagnosed with colon cancer. Energy is a unique and intimate portrait of his life as he confronts a life-changing illness and attempts to continue his never-ending tour. Directed by Michelle Heighway ‘Energy’ are currently crowd-funding, with the film due for release in December 2019. Although Damo’s struggle with his health provides the film’s main narrative arc, ‘Energy’ also examines the past, present and future of this highly influential musician’s work, whilst also capturing his singular outlook on art, protest, lifestyle and alternatives to mainstream thought.Equally prominent in the film as an intimate depiction of the loving care given to Damo by his partner Elke Morsbach and their home life together. Damo Suzuki and Elke Morsbach As Suzuki fights cancer we’re taken on a colourful, thought provoking, humorous and free-thinking journey, which often finds the viewer willing the strength for Damo to survive the operations and begin his beloved touring again.With animation of Damo's lucid, hospital bed dreams of starvation, riding on motorbikes for food, old cartoons, hypnotised brainwashed birds, fancy hats, mini skirts and medication, Michelle pieces together a beautiful portrait. This is augmented by vintage archive footage and access to his carefully preserved treasure trove of memories, made up of old photos, drawings, posters and more.“This documentary is a wonderful story of hope and survival. It’s a personal portrait of the life and times of a nomad, poet, unique performer on his very inspiring journey. This has been a really compelling experience that has changed me on so many levels; and I feel this will transfer to the audience”, concludes Heighway. The enigmatic Suzuki was found by the now seminal band CAN in the streets of late ‘60s Germany, praying and performing bare chested in jeans with long black hair. Impressed and inspired, they asked him to play a show with them that night, with no rehearsal. He did, and the rest is history; this was a pivotal point for Damo and his sense of outsider art, centred around creating and performing with no plan.(Image above taken from  RedBull Academy . Damo shared a great set of sketches which re creates Damo's back story from the 70's , which was another factor that inspired animation within the feature documentary)Suzuki is renowned for playing shows that are never rehearsed as part of a never-ending tour with Damo Suzuki's Network, a constantly changing line-up of band members who act as ‘sound carriers’. Damo had been touring the world doing the above for 20 years, before it came to a halt when he was diagnosed with cancer in 2014.Damo Suzuki’s never-ending world tour has resulted in some of the most spontaneous and exciting shows in modern music, with the singer enlisting on-the-spot backing bands in cities across the world. Michelle Heighway runs the independent production company i4visuals. Michelle is known for her critically acclaimed documentary Mr. Somebody? , which is also a rare intimate portrait that took place over 4 years, this was premiered at Sheffield Doc Festival 2014. Damo and his Robot Sidekick Image Design by Elliot Elam (Designed for Damo Suzuki Network show at Leeds  Brudenell Social Club - Available Products - Mug and Tote Bag. Fish Head Design by Lori Wollens  T SHIRT DESIGN #1Available Products -  Mug , T-Shirt & Tote Bag.T SHIRT DESIGN #2 - Abstract HeadT SHIRT DESIGN #3 - Damo Sketch - Red HatKey Rings/ Bottle Openers - Designed by Anya Clayton  What is Energy ?Energy is Michelle Heighway's 2nd Feature Documentary.

<p>This campaign is raising funds towards the production budget of the short film, to cover location permits, props and costumes, equipment hire and cast and crew fees. The film is being developed as part of the Raindance Film Festival Masters Program to screen at festivals both here and across Europe and will also act as a proof of concept for the feature film upon which it is based.</p>
<p>Backing this project will help us, quite literally, to get the film made and ready for its festival submissions. We are producing the film entirely independently, without any recourse to public funding or grants. </p>

<p><strong>Sound Designer - Maciej Londo</strong> is a Polish born sound mixer and designer with a background in live sound engineering. Passionate about sound, film and music, his focus is on location sound and sound design for film. Since moving to the UK he has been involved as location recorder, sound mixer and sound designer in a wide variety of TV, film and commercial projects.</p>
<p><strong>Cast - Niall Bishop</strong> is native of Galway in the west of Ireland and trained with the Focus Theatre and Gaiety school of Acting in Dublin as well as with the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama in London.

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Filming a single take film, in multiple locations, at night, poses some significant hurdles. Part of the production process includes a detailed rehearsal period to help us best realise the challenge we have set ourselves. Justin's extensive background experience in theatre, as well as our cast's, means that they are well versed in 'live', long sequence performance, but we are also helped by the fact that our D.O.P, Jackie Read, also started out by studying Live Performance and can bring her experience to the technical challenges we face. We are also helped by the breadth of professional industry mentorship that has been brought to the project, via the Raindance Film Festival Master's Program. Our mentors can include shooting Clint Eastwood films and Producing Award winning Independent Feature Films amongst their credits.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
We’re a group of film students, all learning our craft while specialising in different roles on the film. Any money we raise will go straight into production of the film, i.e., transporting equipment, keeping the actors fed and paying for location and post-production costs. Cast and crew will all be working for free!
 

What We Need & What You Get
Shooting starts very soon and we're hoping to raise €11,000 - so time is of the essence. If you can afford to give us ten euro, that’ll really help. If you can afford to give us ten thousand euro, that’ll really, really help!

It will be the third and the last episode that will complete the Clerkenwell trilogy.The first film from that trilogy was made  back in 2002 and is called “Bathtime in Clerkenwell”.  This animation was about the great revolution of cuckoos, leaving their weight-driven wall clocks and taking over London.  Film won following awards:Jury Award for the Best Animation at Sundance Online Film Festival 2004, prize ""for the perfection of music and fantastic Imaginary"" at Ottawa animated film festival 2004, Grand Jury Award for the best animated short at Florida Film Festival 2003, The Best of Show Award from ASIFA-East 2003, Grand Prize from ASIFA--West, prize for the best film in ""applied animation"" category at KROK --2003 (Russia-Ukraine), diploma from IX Russian Festival of Animated Films, Best Animation at Boston Underground Film Festival, Third Prize at Film Fest New Heaven. The second film, “Last time in Clerkenwell”, was released five years later and focused mainly on the global expansion of Cuckoo Empire. London was not enough for the cuckoos - they took over the entire planet and wanted more.  This is the list of  awards: Best applied animation at the International Film Festival of Animation Bimini , Honorable Mention at Tribeca International Film Festival (New York, USA), ""Excellence in Design"" from ASIFA-East (New York, USA), Special Jury Prize at Seoul International Animation Film Festival (SICAF, Korea). Best music video at the Animation Block Party (New York), Best animated clip at Tindirindis IFF, Special Distinction Award in TV Program Category at China International Animation and Digital Arts Festival (CICDAF 2009). It is after this film got honorable mention at Tribeca, I received a message from David Bowie, asking me to send him   a disc with all my films. It appeared that he was one of the jurors that year. 

The third and last part will also be set in Clerkenwell and will be dedicated to various  relationships between the cuckoos. Can’t say more about that right now! The animation will be in the same style as two previous parts, mostly black and white.
The music is written by my friend Stephen Coates from  “The Real Tuesday Weld”, who provided soundtracks for the two previous films.During this campaign me and Stephen will  tell you all about Clerkenwell. We prepared more than 30 stories and will be posting an update with one Clerkenwell story everyday!  I address all of you, international fans of Clerkenwell animations, please help me to make this happen.  If you like the project, if you want this film to be completed, please contribute and spread the word.

Он будет являться третьей и последней частью, завершающей трилогию анимационных короткометражек о приключениях кукушек из Клеркенвелла. Первая часть трилогии называлась «Время принять ванну в Клеркенвелле», вышла в 2002 году и рассказывала о великой революции Британских кукушек, которые повылезали из своих ходиков и захватили Лондон. Этот фильм получил следующие награды: Приз жюри за лучшую анимацию на фестивале Sundance Online, приз за ""совершенство музыки и фантастическое воображение"" на фестивале анимации в Оттаве, главный приз жюри за лучшую анимацию на  кино фестивале в Орландо, Best of Show от ASIFA East (Нью Йорк), гран-при за лучшую анимацию от ASIFA West, (Лос Анжелес), приз за лучшую прикладную анимацию на фестивале анимации Крок, диплом Суздальского фестиваля анимации, приз за лучшую анимацию на Бостонском кинофестивале, приз на фестивале в Нью Хэйвене.  Второй фильм, под названием «Потерянное время в Клеркенвелле» был сделан через  5 лет после первой части и рассказывал об экспансии империи кукушек. Лондона им оказалось мало, они захватили всю планету и  хотели ещё большего. Эта часть заработала следующие награды: приз за лучшую прикладную анимацию на международном фестивале анимации Бимини, почётное упоминание на международном фестивале Трайбека в Нью Йорке, приз за ""совершенство дизайна"" от ASIFA-East (Нью Йорк), специальный приз жюри международного фестиваля анимации в Сеуле, приз за лучшее музыкальное видео на фестивале Animation Block Party (Нью Йорк), приз за лучший клип на фестивале анимации Тиндириндис, специальный приз фестиваля анимации CICDAF в Китае. После того как фильм был показан на фестивале Трайбека ко мне поступило послание от Дэвида Боуи   с просьбой выслать ему все мои фильмы. Он, как оказалось был в жюри.   Третья  и последняя часть будет иллюстрировать взаимоотношения между кукушками. Место действия, естественно, Клеркенвелл, большего увы сказать не могу. Фильм будет выдержан в стиле предыдущих частей, в черно белой графике. Музыку к нему тоже написал мой друг, англичанин Стивен Коутс из гуппы The Real Tuesday Weld.Во время этой кампании мы со Стивеном постараемся рассказать вам всё о Клеркенвелле, каждый день в течение месяца опубликовывая по одной истории, а их мы подготовили более тридцати.   Я обращаюсь ко всем поклонникам Клеркенвелльских кукушек, если вам понравился этот проект и вы хотите помочь мне закончить этот фильм – распространите эту информацию, делайте пожалуйста взносы, а так же не забудьте посетить страничку фильма в Фейсбуке:  https://www.facebook.com/pg/bathwellinclerkentime/posts/?ref=page_internalТе кто по каким-то причинам не могут использовать эту платформу, могут перечислять денюжку на пэйпэл budovskiy@yahoo.com или на карточку Сбера 4276 2700 3517 8845Спасибо за поддержку!Взнос $5 и больше.Вы будете получать эксклюзивные обновления по проекту и персональное «Спасибо» на страничке фильма в Фейсбуке.Взнос $10 и больше.Всё вышеперечисленное + возможность скачать на десктоп кадр из фильма высокого разрешения.  Можно выбрать  тот что ниже, или из тех что выше.

A device hailed as the gold standard of gynecological, robotic surgery. In the midst of tremendous grief, the couple launches a relentless campaign to expose the practice, and ban the device known as a Power Morcellator, all while trying to beat the disease. Together they ignite a debate about risk and benefit, enrage an entire specialty, and challenge the medical establishment to look closer and listen to the victims.   The importance of this film lies in its propositions to the audience, surely composed of both experts and laypeople, physicians and regulators, patients and loved ones, professors and students, men and women. This film pits innovation against precaution and professional enthusiasm against critical examination. Your contribution to this project is an investment in an active community, in an informed community, and in a thoughtful medical culture. How much do you trust your doctor?What is the greatest risk you would accept for more comfort and convenience?What about if you discovered a flaw in an otherwise productive tool?If you made a mistake, would you admit it? Would you apologize?If someone was hurt and angry and loud, would you listen or would you shut them out?This film tackles these questions and explores the potential consequences of the typical ways we answer them.   My name is Kyle Floyd. I am a 2017 graduate of Boston University's College of Communication, where I focused on documentary production. As a junior, I directed and produced a 40-minute documentary about the unique struggle facing victims of campus sexual assault. https://kafloyd.wixsite.com/aftermath.  I am drawn to investigative projects and stories that examine institutional or systematic wrongdoing specifically because they aren't simple, and they can't be solved by removing one individual. Blockbusters featuring heroes and villains dominate modern entertainment in large part because they provide a good adrenaline rush, but also because they boil down conflict to good vs. evil, a tale as old as time itself that requires no critical thought or effort to understand human nature. This is not one of those films and this is not a simple issue. Like the issue of campus sexual assault, it's meant to examine personal motivations and traditional behaviors that stand in the way of reform. I want to contribute to growing critical viewers and ultimately critical citizens who scrutinize and then improve our society.I began working on Kicking The Hornet's Nest in the summer of 2014, my sophomore year. This nearly-five year production has taken me around the United States, into the homes of those personally affected and into the offices of physicians with a front seat to this controversial procedure. At times the experience was painful, and at other times it was intimidating, but ultimately I was forced to throw myself into a subject matter of which I had no prior knowledge, and attempt to capture a range of strong opinions and an enormous amount of medical information in a way that could be communicated in a clear and balanced fashion.                   
Additional Footage - An evidence-based documentary such as this faces unique challenges in terms of recreating dramatic events. An assortment of material including stock footage of locations that couldn't be accessed in production and archival footage of past events and news broadcasts will work collectively to build a visual backbone for the film and put the viewer in the moment.  
Graphics/Animation - 2D and 3D graphics and animation sequences will be enlisted to illustrate medical procedures and processes in detail as well as to outline statistical arguments and numerous academic studies associated with the cases being discussed. ​​​Original Score - a musical score assembled specifically for this film will contribute to a sense of movement and compliment a story that moves frequently between emotional beats and startling insights.  Color Grading/Correction - A professional color grade and correction will give the film a polished, consistent visual style. 
Sound Mixing/Editing - A professional sound mix will balance all of the different kinds of audio used in the film, such as interview audio, archival audio, the original score, and other sound effects. Sound editing will provide an opportunity to clean up sound that was originally recorded in noisy or less than ideal circumstances.   
 E/O Insurance - An errors and omissions insurance policy will help to ensure the film's rights and protections to the interviews and all other materials used on the basis of a fair use argument.  In the entertainment industry, agents shed blood, sweat and tears to get their client the best credit on the project the possibly can. From Production Assistant, all the way up to Producer, these titles represent a hierarchy of contribution and commitment. I want to recognize every individual who gives to this campaign and empower them as champions of the work.

<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
<p>The sequel to Hooper's 2014 film, <i>The Anatomy of a Great Deception</i>, ""AGD2"" is set for an international theater release in September 2019.</p>
<p>According to Hooper, ""AGD1 is about how the demolition of Building 7 first opened my eyes.  AGD2 continues the analysis of 9/11 while addressing how such a large deception was pulled off and how it's linked with other major events in history.""  Hooper shares private struggles and victories on a much deeper level, as well.  ""I think people who've had their eyes opened by looking into 9/11 will find this film to be cathartic, and a handy tool to give a friend, whose eyes you'd like to open,"" adds the filmmaker.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>PURPOSE OF THE FILM</h3>
<p>In September 2014, we met regular-American-turned-filmmaker, David Hooper, while grappling with the ramifications of  “one innocent question” about 9/11.   <i>The Anatomy of a Great Deception </i>Trilogy continues with AGD2 in September 2019, on the heels of AGD1’s 45-city release, viewed by 30 million people and counting.  </p>
<p>AGD2 delves deeply into the 9/11 attacks, and much further, while addressing “how” such a massive ruse was orchestrated.  Like AGD1, Hooper discloses the unvarnished truth of his personal struggles and victories in coping with many staggering discoveries that will leave viewer’s jaws on the ground.  Together, these films tell the story millions across the world have experienced, who’ve had their eyes opened.</p>

<p><strong> why I want to do this project?</strong></p>
<p>reading this story is what made me want to step up and direct for the first time!  I was approached to act in this piece a few years back and when I had time to look at it again and knew that actor Peter Outerbridge was still interested in starring ...that's when I decided to direct!  I believe that Viaticum will reach a wide audience and resonate on many levels.  It touches upon alcoholism, gay-bashing, teen-suicide, teen-bullying, dysfunctional families and the ensuing result.  Another part of the story that is truly thought provoking is the idea of how religion plays into our lives and the comfort that sacraments can provide.   In addition to Viaticum being an important film with a relatable story, the film is very female centric -  It  is written by a woman and is being directed by a woman.  The lead female character , Liz is an emotionally complex everyday woman. She doesn't just cry and doesn't just smile. And that is what drew me even more to this project.  It rang true.  This kind of story helps people to feel not so alone in their struggles and can provide a sense of hope and connection.  The film presents some hard questions and potential answers.  I am passionate about bringing this story to life!</p>

<p>We are lucky and thrilled to have one of the most amazing Canadian actors of our time, Peter Outerbridge, on board this project!  Ever since the early 90's, Outerbridge has been a steady presence not only on the silver screen but also on TV. Among many others, he played three different characters on the science fiction show The Outer Limits, had a recurring role in season three of Chris Carter's mystery spin-off Millennium, played the lead in three feature-length episodes of the 2004 version of The Murdoch Mysteries, and scored his biggest lead role to date in the same year, when he was cast as headstrong scientist David Sandström in The Movie Network's ReGenesis.

By donating to our film, you will literally get to see your kindness spread awareness, touch peoples hearts, and potentially save lives. </p>

<p><strong>my story:</strong></p>
<p>My beginnings in the entertainment industry date back to my days as a child actor which I abandoned for my love of figure skating.   My academic pursuits were always in the maths and sciences and for a while I thought I was headed to a medical career.  It was during these university years that my passion for dance and acting changed my path forever.  After being hired for several gigs I realized I was only going to be happy if I gave 100% to my true passion..that of an entertainer!  I have been lucky to have worked on amazing projects with outstanding cast and crew.  I value all of these experiences and each on has led me to who and where I am right now.  Above all,  I have had the priveledge of working with my husband, Damian Lee, a prolific film maker.  For the past twenty years I have been ""learning by osmosis"" as the  saying goes.   My exposure to independent film making and all that it encompasses is beyond what any school ever could teach.  I have been a part of development, script writing, financing, distribution, casting, and all aspects of getting a film shot right through to the editing room and the final mix.  I have brought some of our more artistic films  (Woman Wanted, Hearts of War and King of Sorrow), to the film festival circuit achieving great accolades and  winning awards there.  I have learned how each of these stages of getting a film made offer the film maker key choices and opportunities to make the film better.  These decisions all require the director to have not only a great vision, but the ability to pass it on to a team they trust and whom can contribute to all of these steps.</p>
<p> At this point in my career,  I am eager to take all of the knowledge I have acquired and apply it,  along with my own creativity, to a project I believe in.  Directing has always come naturally to me.  In fact my career began as  a dance choreographer of music videos and fashion shows.  I was directing my talent and learning how to get performances, not that different from film directing.  While on the set of Ice Girls, my first produced screen play, I was able to contribute not only as a performer but also as a director when the scenes were on the ice and required a skater's eye.  This experience inspired my to take the next step and direct my first short film.  Viaticum was a gift.  Maureen had passed the story on to me to read several years ago.  Always a favourite of hers, she had dreams of seeing her story come to life.  I was honoured when she allowed me to write the script with her, and even more thrilled at her support of my directing the piece.  I am committed to making Viaticum the work of art it deserves be.  </p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div><h3> </h3></div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","why I want to do this project?
reading this story is what made me want to step up and direct for the first time!  I was approached to act in this piece a few years back and when I had time to look at it again and knew that actor Peter Outerbridge was still interested in starring ...that's when I decided to direct!  I believe that Viaticum will reach a wide audience and resonate on many levels.  It touches upon alcoholism, gay-bashing, teen-suicide, teen-bullying, dysfunctional families and the ensuing result.  Another part of the story that is truly thought provoking is the idea of how religion plays into our lives and the comfort that sacraments can provide.   In addition to Viaticum being an important film with a relatable story, the film is very female centric -  It  is written by a woman and is being directed by a woman.  The lead female character , Liz is an emotionally complex everyday woman. She doesn't just cry and doesn't just smile. And that is what drew me even more to this project.  It rang true.  This kind of story helps people to feel not so alone in their struggles and can provide a sense of hope and connection.  The film presents some hard questions and potential answers.  I am passionate about bringing this story to life!

<h3>Director's Statement</h3>
<p>Why do we handle depression the way we do? Why is depression this mysterious thing that is diagnosable and something that people can just quantify? Why do we just try to cover it up and suppress it with painkillers? Why do we stop at awareness? These are questions that I had to struggle with in my own depression. For me, my world didn’t just suddenly became all gloomy or sad one day, but this darkness had been building in me after my most recently failed relationship. I had put so much into our connection, and to have its dissolution pull her and friends apart made my world all the darker. This film came out of that struggle; I first wrote it as a cathartic piece acknowledging where I had been and where I am now. I needed to process my depression, what caused it, and what brought me out.  As I was having a conversation about the project and how it was helping me process, a friend opened up to me about how he himself had an experience with depression through a family member and how simply talking about it brought so much light into his situation. Then I began to realize that one of the most encouraging and helpful weapons we have to fight this is conversation… face to face. Sometimes all it takes is a simple talk with another real human being to keep someone from leaving this world. And if my story could start these conversations then why not share it? I must share it.</p>
<p>This story at first was very grounded in reality and had little fiction. However, now after ten drafts and over 10 months of working on the script I feel that the particular experiences and events in the main character Charles’s life are now very different from my own, but still resonate just as painfully. And, as Charles discovers, anxiety doesn't have to lead to despair and suicide, but can lead to hope and restoration.</p>
<p>In Rubaru we first meet Charles at what he thinks is the end of his story. He begins sharing memories and as we walk through his journey his life and well-being become more and more complicated until we come to the most important relationship he has. This is a film that places you in someone else’s shoes, in a slice of life where you can see all the pain and ups and downs that someone goes through and how that affects them. But, most importantly, it doesn’t end there. It’s sometimes hard to find in all the mess of life, but through the crap Charles goes through we find the beauty and the goodness that lies in store for him.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This intimate story explores the impact of depression on a young man's life and the importance of face to face conversations with family, friends, coworkers, and other real human beings. Mental health, loneliness, isolation, depression, these are far too common themes in our culture that seem too overwhelming to conquer. There isn't one single bullet to solve all their problems, but Rubaru shows how one person's intentional conversation can change someone's life. As we make and share this story, we want to spread that message and encourage people to do the same towards people they know, battling mental health one person at a time, face to face.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Filmmaking is an expensive endeavor, but we're making this entire feature length film for approximately $20,000. This sounds like a lot, but when you consider feeding the entire cast and crew for a month, transportation, art department, marketing, post production, location fees, etc. it adds up quickly and this is pennies compared to Hollywood films. How are we able to do it?</p>
<p>Since we're students at Biola University, we have access to state of the art gear and sound stages for free and have connections to venues around LA and Orange counties that post-graduate filmmakers wouldn't have. This DIY strategy is allowing us to do things uniquely efficiently and put every penny we raise to exponentially enhance the way we tell our story.</p>
<p>We're putting a lot of our own savings towards this project, working with sponsors, churches, and businesses, but we need your help to feed our 30+ team and finish a large apartment set.</p>

Why do we handle depression the way we do? Why is depression this mysterious thing that is diagnosable and something that people can just quantify? Why do we just try to cover it up and suppress it with painkillers? Why do we stop at awareness? These are questions that I had to struggle with in my own depression. For me, my world didn’t just suddenly became all gloomy or sad one day, but this darkness had been building in me after my most recently failed relationship. I had put so much into our connection, and to have its dissolution pull her and friends apart made my world all the darker.

<h3>Lonely à la Mode</h3>
<p>Based around the music of Thee Shambels, Lonely à la Mode delivers three stories of heartbreak, longing and missed opportunities, somewhere akin to the movies of Wim Wenders and Sam Shepherd. </p>
<p>Three songs, three films! A Matryoshka doll of a film! A trapeze artist misses his partner, lovers disconnect on a subway train, a brother and sister navigate life with mental illness and a boorish Southern patriarch gets his comeuppance at his own funeral...</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>How We Got Here</h3>
<p>I returned to song writing in 2005 after a decade working in newspapers. Three minute stories in a minor key, with characters conjured up like a drunken teenager with a Ouija board. By recording the album ‘Lonely à la Mode’ with my band Thee Shambels, in 2016, I thought I could move on to new songs, new stories.</p>
<p>But the characters I’d created wouldn’t leave me alone, and those stubborn little spirits were joined by others. You see, a rock ‘n’ roll song isn’t really long enough to tell their tales in depth. So, to exorcise the ghosts, I turned to film—a childhood obsession—and I invoked them once more. </p>
<p>In one form or another, I've been working on this film for two years, but it wasn't until Samatha Jean Moore came on board as a producer that the wheels started to roll. She was instrumental in guiding me to shoot in her home state or I should say, <i>the Commonwealth, </i>of Kentucky.</p>
<p>""It's dripping with Southern Gothic,"" she said, ""you'll love it.""</p>
<p>""Cool"" I said, and I did.</p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We’re not asking you to take a risk, we’ve already shot the film, it’s in the can, but we need some more money to get the film out there.  One of the ways we can do this, is by entering film festivals, this costs money: Producing the DVD screeners, the entry fees, and when we get into the festivals we want to represent the film, which means Samantha and I will travel to the film festivals, wherever they might be, and talk to people about our film, and that’s where we need your help.</p>
<p>Remember! We’ve already shot the film, it’s done! You’re not contributing to some hair-brained scheme where the project will never see the light of day. </p>

<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>I’m Brian Sanders, and I’m making a feature length documentary called Food Lies. It's the sordid history of our dietary guidelines, the epidemic of chronic disease and obesity that followed, what the new science is telling us humans should actually be eating, and how to eat that food sustainably.</p>
<p>“What should we eat?” There’s so much conflicting information out there, you can even find a website espousing the miracles of an all-twinkie diet. You spend money and willpower trying to make healthy decisions, but you just gain more weight. It seems hopeless</p>
<p>Misinformation and bad science has led us astray over the past 60 years. It wasn’t malicious; it wasn't a government conspiracy; we just got some things wrong. 'Eating fat makes you fat' seemed logical. Cholesterol in food and cholesterol in clogged arteries seemed like an obvious connection. 'Heart healthy grains' was repeated so many times by so many reputable organizations, we just accepted it as fact. The problem is, none of it’s true.</p>
<p>I’ve been a filmmaker since middle school. I’ve also built and sold a tech company, worked as a mechanical engineer, and now, I’ve quit my job to devote the rest of my life to this cause. I’ve researched every conflicting dietary approach and it’s all finally starting to make sense—even some of the vegan arguments. I’ve put this research into practice, and now, at age 35, I’m in the best shape of my life. My vitals and blood work are flawless and I haven’t been sick in 3 years. The same goes for countless family, friends, and millions around the world.</p>
<p>We’re so close to finishing this film, but we need your support. With your contributions, we can shoot the remainder of the documentary, complete post-production, and inform the public about this crucial issue. Please pre-order a copy of the film and check out our great rewards. Thank you for your support.</p>
<p>-Brian</p> <h3><strong>The Story</strong></h3>
<p><strong>This film will cover much more than what's depicted in the trailer. Highlights will include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>How we misunderstood nutrition and spread the wrong information</li>
<li>The resulting epidemic of chronic disease and obesity</li>
<li>Lies, myths, and propaganda</li>
<li>What humans are supposed to eat</li>
<li>The unifying theory of nutrition</li>
<li>Tons of graphics to explain things easily</li>
<li>How to source these foods both ethically and sustainably</li>
<li>Multiple narrative storylines </li>
<li>And a lot more!</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>This film will be handy for:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Someone who’s confused by continuously conflicting headlines on what’s supposedly healthy.</li>
<li>Your vegan coworker who not-so-subtly accuses you of killing yourself and the planet every time you have meat for lunch.</li>
<li>Someone with chronic disease or family history of one and wants to learn how diet can help treat, prevent, or reverse it.</li>
<li>Your aunt who doesn't know anything about nutrition and wants a tight 90-minute audio-visual presentation of all the info.</li>
<li>You to send to someone as a recap of everything you’ve been trying to tell them for the past 3 years.</li>
<li>Someone who lost their roommate—and their roommate’s Netflix subscription—so they have nothing to watch.</li>
<li>Sharp people who already know this stuff, eat this way, and want to expand their knowledge base.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>

<p>We've already shot half of the film!</p>
<p>We won't accept money from any outside interests, food companies, or organizations. We aren't even accepting money from traditional production companies. We know they will take some creative control and influence the final product.</p>
<p>In other words, we're doing this all on our own—and with the help of generous contributors like you!</p>
<p>We still need your support to help shoot the remaining interviews with these great experts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Professor Tim Noakes</li>
<li>Mark Sisson</li>
<li>Nina Teicholz</li>
<li>Dom D'Agostino</li>
<li>And more!</li>
</ul> <p>We’d like to thank Nina, Mark, Prof. Noakes, and Dr. Eenfeldt at DietDoctor.com for allowing us to use their footage for our trailer.</p>

<p>The simple answer is - this is my life.</p>
<p>I've truly gone all-in on this ""movement."" I've left the world of well-paying, stable jobs behind, and jumped into this fully. I'm excited where it's going to take me.</p>
<p>I also live by these principles and have achieved optimum health. I recently got a full physical and cholesterol panel and am (in the doctor's words) ""in perfect health."" My cholesterol and other markers show I am totally free of all indicators of heart disease, diabetes, or any metabolic disease.</p>

<p>To me, this is more than just a film, this is my life's work. I've committed to continue on after the film is completed to contribute to the health of our world in areas such as:</p>
<p>- working with doctors to create health plans that prevent and reverse chronic disease instead of just masking the symptoms</p>
<p>- reduce our reliance on industrial agriculture</p>
<p>- continuing to research, promote, and support accurate, unbiased information on health</p>

Hi Everyone,
I’m Brian Sanders, and I’m making a feature length documentary called Food Lies. It's the sordid history of our dietary guidelines, the epidemic of chronic disease and obesity that followed, what the new science is telling us humans should actually be eating, and how to eat that food sustainably.
“What should we eat?” There’s so much conflicting information out there, you can even find a website espousing the miracles of an all-twinkie diet. You spend money and willpower trying to make healthy decisions, but you just gain more weight. It seems hopeless
Misinformation and bad science has led us astray over the past 60 years. It wasn’t malicious; it wasn't a government conspiracy; we just got some things wrong. 'Eating fat makes you fat' seemed logical. Cholesterol in food and cholesterol in clogged arteries seemed like an obvious connection. 'Heart healthy grains' was repeated so many times by so many reputable organizations, we just accepted it as fact. The problem is, none of it’s true.
I’ve been a filmmaker since middle school. I’ve also built and sold a tech company, worked as a mechanical engineer, and now, I’ve quit my job to devote the rest of my life to this cause. I’ve researched every conflicting dietary approach and it’s all finally starting to make sense—even some of the vegan arguments. I’ve put this research into practice, and now, at age 35, I’m in the best shape of my life. My vitals and blood work are flawless and I haven’t been sick in 3 years. The same goes for countless family, friends, and millions around the world.
We’re so close to finishing this film, but we need your support. With your contributions, we can shoot the remainder of the documentary, complete post-production, and inform the public about this crucial issue. Please pre-order a copy of the film and check out our great rewards. Thank you for your support.
-Brian The Story
This film will cover much more than what's depicted in the trailer. Highlights will include:

How we misunderstood nutrition and spread the wrong information
The resulting epidemic of chronic disease and obesity
Lies, myths, and propaganda
What humans are supposed to eat
The unifying theory of nutrition
Tons of graphics to explain things easily
How to source these foods both ethically and sustainably
Multiple narrative storylines 
And a lot more!

 
This film will be handy for:

Someone who’s confused by continuously conflicting headlines on what’s supposedly healthy.
Your vegan coworker who not-so-subtly accuses you of killing yourself and the planet every time you have meat for lunch.
Someone with chronic disease or family history of one and wants to learn how diet can help treat, prevent, or reverse it.
Your aunt who doesn't know anything about nutrition and wants a tight 90-minute audio-visual presentation of all the info.
You to send to someone as a recap of everything you’ve been trying to tell them for the past 3 years.
Someone who lost their roommate—and their roommate’s Netflix subscription—so they have nothing to watch.
Sharp people who already know this stuff, eat this way, and want to expand their knowledge base.

 
Find out more about the film at FoodLies.org  <----- Our Status
We've already shot half of the film!
We won't accept money from any outside interests, food companies, or organizations. We aren't even accepting money from traditional production companies. We know they will take some creative control and influence the final product.
In other words, we're doing this all on our own—and with the help of generous contributors like you!
We still need your support to help shoot the remaining interviews with these great experts:

Professor Tim Noakes
Mark Sisson
Nina Teicholz
Dom D'Agostino
And more!
 We’d like to thank Nina, Mark, Prof. Noakes, and Dr. Eenfeldt at DietDoctor.com for allowing us to use their footage for our trailer.

We filmed with Gary Taubes when he was visiting Santa Monica. We also shot with Dr. Ted Naiman and Denise Minger in Seattle. Everyone has been so amazingly generous with their time and resources!
 

Above is an interview with Dr. Shawn Baker who was in LA to do Joe Rogan’s podcast.
 

 
The simple answer is - this is my life.
I've truly gone all-in on this ""movement."" I've left the world of well-paying, stable jobs behind, and jumped into this fully. I'm excited where it's going to take me.
I also live by these principles and have achieved optimum health. I recently got a full physical and cholesterol panel and am (in the doctor's words) ""in perfect health."" My cholesterol and other markers show I am totally free of all indicators of heart disease, diabetes, or any metabolic disease.

 
I also am the host of the Peak Human Podcast which initially is a 13-part free course on nutrition. I've interviewed 12 of the top experts in their field to explain (much of) this confusing and conflicting information in one series.

 
To me, this is more than just a film, this is my life's work. I've committed to continue on after the film is completed to contribute to the health of our world in areas such as:
- working with doctors to create health plans that prevent and reverse chronic disease instead of just masking the symptoms
- reduce our reliance on industrial agriculture
- continuing to research, promote, and support accurate, unbiased information on health

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I grew up in two different, very small towns. Some would call them ""throw-away"" towns, but we'll call them outskirts for formality's sake. My parents had varying health issues, from being legally blind, to struggling with mental illness. This caused me to grow up quite quickly, and take on responsibilities normal kids my age wouldn't have to. My childhood experience felt unrelatable to any one of my friends', and of anything I saw on T.V. or movies. Since then, more things have come out revolving around having parents who are different and how that shapes our upbringing, but nothing has really encapsulated the experience of growing up with parents who are disabled. </p>
<p>It's been a dream of mine since I was a child to make a film surrounding this idea, and to someday start an organization to be a resource for kids in these situations. The film is only a first step, and the short, an extension of that.  Making the short film for my thesis enables me to extend the reach of the story, and potentially get recognition for the story and get to make the full feature film. </p>
<p>Ultimately, helping me will help other kids going through this to know that they aren't alone and in what ways it can get better for them.</p>

It is a film about letting go, dependency and the extreme choices we are willing to make in pursuit of our concept of a perfect life.

<h2>HOME</h2>
<p><u><strong>Synopsis</strong></u></p>
<p>Home is a dramatic fantasy short film about a young girl who loses her parents in a mysterious disappearance.  She spends the next 15 years searching for them but has no luck in finding them.  Over the course of this time, she withdraws herself further from everyday life.  She consistently falls behind on her rent, alienates friends, and struggles to even make it to her weekly counseling sessions.  Through all of this, she experiences vivid dreams that she swears are more than dreams... perhaps visions.  Though her relentless hope to find her parents paints her as a lunatic, she can feel that they're out there somewhere.</p>
<p><u><strong>About The Film</strong></u></p>
<p>Some recent, tonally-similar films to Home are Arrival and Blade Runner: 2049.  I want the film to be deeply rooted in reality, so when the fantastic events at our climax arrive, they wow our audience.  </p>
<p>When I wrote home, I was writing from the perspective of someone who has been somewhat-nomadic throughout life.  It wasn't until I met my wife that I felt like I had a home anywhere.  But I eventually found that the film ""Joe Dirt"" was quite right in its cheesy line, ""Home is where you make it.""  And with the arrival of our daughter Luna, we're a home to a filmmaking family who loves to create together.</p>
<p>Our hopes for the film are to make it a serious festival contender and submit it to as many festivals as we're able.  Festival submission fees have also been worked into the total fundrasing amount.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Cast and Crew</h3>
<p>The cast and crew of the film are all folks that I've worked with quite a bit and I know that they'll come out and work to make Home truly amazing.  Let's meet some of them!</p>

<p>Wade is a seasoned actor who has also discovered a wonderful talent for directing.  When directing, he has a unique ability in coaxing nuanced performances out of his actors.  </p>

<p>J.D. has had a long career in the film industry, with passions for Directing, Assistant Directing, and Costuming.  She is detail-focused and because she's worked in nearly every department in film and theater, she knows exactly what it takes to build a film from from pre-production to final delivery.</p>

<p>I (Tim) am a cinematographer who got my professional start shooting behind-the-scenes shorts documenting the making of feature films.  After shooting nearly 40 of these, some in very challenging conditions, I learned to use natural and motivated lighting to my advantage in creating interesting and engaging stories.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As the cinematographer for Home, one of the things that I've done in pre-preproduction is to design every shot of the film (In our shot-list) to look and feel magical.  And a few of the tools that I'm excited to implement for the film are the camera and lens combination that we've secured for the shoot.  We'll be capturing everything on the Blackmagic Ursa Mini Pro &amp; a set of vintage Cineovision High-Speed, Anamorphic prime lenses.  These will also play a vital role in crafting magical images for Home.</p>

<p>You may also be wondering where the funding for the film will go.   Well, here is a list:</p>
</div><div><ul>
<li>Number one will be to the cast and crew.  We want to be able to pay our cast and crew for the time, talent &amp; effort that they put into this film.</li>
<li>Second, funding will go to food and transportation for our cast and crew.  We want to make sure that everyone is well nourished and that everyone can get out to some of our more remote desert locations.</li>
<li>Funding will also be going to the payment for our crew, rental of equipment, locations, purchase of props and set pieces that will help to create a more immersive story, and hard drives to store all of our important footage and audio on.</li>
<li>I've also budgeted a small amount for any contingencies that might occur during production.  These contingencies include things like equipment failures and additional meals for days that run longer than expected.</li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the greatest challenges in bringing ""Home"" to life is going to be shooting at night in a remote desert location outside of Lancaster, CA.  Not only will getting folks out to the location be a hurtle but lighting our scenes will also be tough.  Fortunately, we will be using the power of carpooling to make sure that if we do get lost, at least we'll be lost together! :D  Also, the lighting scheme that I've planned for will be all battery-powered LED lighting, that is lightweight, powerful, and will last for many hours.</p>
<p>Over the course of 7 years, I've worked on over 50 feature-length films and have learned what to do and not do in order to bring a project through to completion.  I've also successfully funded the post-production of three previous short films here on Indiegogo, so I'm no stranger to the community.   I believe that through the hard work of our talented &amp; diverse cast &amp; crew, we will deliver a beautiful finished ""Home.""</p>

<p><strong>The Motivation:</strong><br/><strong>Best Reason You Should Contribute?</strong></p>
<div>
<p>Let's face it, the zombie and faith based film world have pretty much become repetitive. Why not be part of the first faith based zombie film? Why not shake up the genres by helping to create an action packed, dramatic, funny and scary film that somehow leaves feeling inspired? If you want your money to make an impact...this is it. </p>

</div>
<p><strong>Movie Pitch</strong></p>
<p>Let's be honest, the world as we know it...is becoming morality free.</p>
<p>Rampant racism, classism, hate, greed and the sheer misuse of faith are the culprits.</p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","The Motivation:Best Reason You Should Contribute?

Let's face it, the zombie and faith based film world have pretty much become repetitive. Why not be part of the first faith based zombie film? Why not shake up the genres by helping to create an action packed, dramatic, funny and scary film that somehow leaves feeling inspired? If you want your money to make an impact...this is it. 


Movie Pitch
Let's be honest, the world as we know it...is becoming morality free.
Rampant racism, classism, hate, greed and the sheer misuse of faith are the culprits.
Most faith based movies rarely help and create a false sense of reality.
Typical storylines go: Everyone is almost perfect and when they mess up, God appears then bam...back to being close to perfect. 
That's not real. Many of us are walking examples of God intervening in our imperfect lives. We cuss, we lie, we get betrayed, we betray, we cheat, we fail, we hurt, we get hurt...we human.

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi, Deyali here!</p>
<p>A decade before, when I was studying Architecture, I used to wonder how these thousands of years old architectures still exist on earth, few excavated, few as ruins. We stand at the present time using architecture with modern innovative technologies. Will our present creations live long as them ? Or was there something special in the architecture of the past, which we still need to explore, the secrets hidden in their layers of stones.</p>
<p>The quest for quenching the creative thirst landed me in a film school few years back. And I learned how to preserve few precious moments, people and even objects for many years, after their lifetime and be shared with many generations and geographies. I find Architecture and Filmmaking have lot of similarities and one of them is that, both deal with capturing the present and holding it for many years. Capturing an Architectural piece like Kanheri caves ( 1st Century BC Buddhist Architecture) in a Documentary film will create synergy.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533889238/jqfncui0yplrkvh9hagq.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Mumbai is an Indian city which is exploding with population at present time. Different class of people co-exist in the city just like two thousand years back, when the Buddhists had built these caves in the same place. They had built houses for living, prayer halls for worshipping, community halls and many more. Even they had individual water-storage with every cave unit along with the rain water harvesting system. All were rock-cut caves built on a mountain surrounded by a dense forest.</p>

<p>Now, Mumbai city has grown around this mountain and forest keeping Kanheri in its heart. Exploring this BC era's Architectural marvel along with the present urban spaces, is the journey of this Documentary film.</p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>The pre-production of the film has started. Also we have been getting in touch with the Archeological experts, Historians and Conservation Architects for the film. We are also collecting the Architectural footprints of the caves and the whole settlement that was built that time. And trying to find out the hidden design principles along with the architects and Historians to understand the civilisation more and talking with the Urban planners to understand what all we can adapt from them to our present time.</p>
<p>This subject needs a good amount of research work and shooting and documenting on the old Architectural piece. For the complete production of the Documentary film we have estimated a budget of $ 50,000. We are also tying to get in touch with the Documentary Fund Providers across the world. Here in Indiegogo we have kept an initial target of <strong>$15,000</strong> to reach first. If it resonates with you please come and be a part of us in creating this film. Hope we could achieve our goal with the help of you. You can provide whatever you can, every little amount counts and makes it big in the end. Also share this small idea with more people whom you think are like-minded. That will help us big time.</p>
<p>This film once made will be taken to various Film Festivals, Architectural colleges as a research material and seminars. Through this film we want to create more awareness and sensitivity towards our own heritage and keep it surviving for at least another thousand years.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Dylan Hoffman, and I will be directing Jack Unplugged. I am a senior Film Production major at Keene State College. I worked on and produced a short film last year called ""Forget About Us"", and now am stepping into the role of director with Jack Unplugged for the first time, hopefully the first of many. This film is extremely important to me, as I think if I get my chance to tell a great story and direct the film, people will enjoy it the way I do, and will lead to more fun opportunities in the future. So this film is as much me proving myself to others as it is proving it to myself. We love this story, and we hope you will too.</p>
<p>You too can be a part of the Jack Unplugged family and help us on this journey by donating to this fundraising campaign. </p>
<p>Jack is a typical college student, trying to figure out what he wants to do with his life. Meanwhile, he is still recovering from the break-up he has had with his first and only girlfriend. Ever since then, he has drowned out the world with music. One day, he meets a girl, and they get to know each other. Jack is starting to remember what love feels like after so long without it, but is afraid of making the same mistakes again. He has high hopes to be happier and finally live his life unplugged.</p>

<p>CREW:</p>

<p>Jake Coulter - Cinematographer</p>
<p>Evan Dexter - Sound Recordist</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So here is our budget broken into more detail:</p>
<p>Props - $100</p>
<p>Costuming - $150</p>
<p>Food - $200</p>
<p>Transportation - $550</p>
<p>Lodging - $400</p>
<p>Reserve Fund - $100</p>
<p>      Total: $1,500</p>
<p>While our wardrobe and prop budget is important, you can see that most of the budget of our film (or any film for that matter) is put towards behind-the-scenes expenses that (hopefully) the audience will never see. So the larger the budget we have, the more of it we can put towards the artistic side of the film, the thing that really makes it what it is. Our goal is to have enough money that we don't have to worry about all of the behind-the-scenes expenses and simply worry about making a great film.</p>
<p>As for our rewards, we have various tiers of prizes for our campaign supporters, ranging from your name in the film's 'Special Thanks' credits to t-shirts, DVDs, CDs, and the opportunity to meet the crew and celebrate the film.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, the ratio we have in each department (wardrobe, food, transport, etc.) will largely stay the same, just with less money to stretch out between them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we surpass our goal, we will have the opportunity to have higher production value and truly pull out all the stops when it comes to what is in the film and how creative we can be.</p>
<p>Either way, this is a non-profit venture, and all of the money we earn here will be for the film. We don't consider money in our own pockets very important when compared with the film. So no matter how much we make, none of it will go to waste.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project will be the culmination of several years of studying film and making short films, with this film being my magnum opus for the foreseeable future. When I produced ""Forget About Us"" last year, it came out very well and was very character-driven with a lot of care put into it. That is something I always want to be known for, interesting characters that you care about, a good story, and putting care into every part of it.</p>
<p>If you help us fun Jack Unplugged, we can promise you both interesting characters and an interesting story. We are very excited to bring this vision to reality for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p>This will be a very important film, and sometimes difficult and busy, but we are so happy to have the opportunity to make it, and no amount of support is too little for us, so we thank you on behalf of our film-to-be. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenges to any film production are money and time. We already have our schedule put together and our cast together, so money is the next big hurdle. That's where our campaign supporters come in.</p>
<p>With our budget, we can focus more on making a good film and less on the preparation and behind-the-scenes challenges, and we can overcome unexpected financial obstacles that may come our way. Things like paying for parking, renting a location, renting any vehicles or equipment we may need, reimbursing our actors for driving in from out of state, and of course using the remaining budget at the end to reward our supporters with specially-made prizes to show our appreciation. </p>
<p>Working on the film last year, I've experienced these problems firsthand and found the best ways to avoid them, and our budget saved us on many occasions that could have stopped us in our tracks. The trick is to always get creative, and solving problems becomes easier with ingenuity and making sure to do everything in an efficient and thoughtful way.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't afford to support Jack Unplugged financially, you can always support us socially.</p>
<p>You can find us on Facebook: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/jackunpluggedfilm/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/jackunpluggedfilm/</a></p>
<p>We love engaging with our supporters, so definitely comment and ask questions when we post about the movie and talk about behind-the-scenes info. We love making movies, and we certainly love talking about making movies just as much.</p>
<p>and when the film is finished and screened in late April, it will become available on YouTube so definitely get to the premiere in Keene when it's time or check it out online.</p>
<p>And as always, even just telling a friend to check out the film or watching it with your friends and family is a huge service to us. Nothing shows that people truly care quite like seeing the number of views go up over time, knowing that we have succeeded in making something that people will watch, enjoy, and come back to with friends.</p>

and when the film is finished and screened in late April, it will become available on YouTube so definitely get to the premiere in Keene when it's time or check it out online.
And as always, even just telling a friend to check out the film or watching it with your friends and family is a huge service to us. Nothing shows that people truly care quite like seeing the number of views go up over time, knowing that we have succeeded in making something that people will watch, enjoy, and come back to with friends.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

It's a tense modern day drama with a unique structure, a clever twist and a sting in the tail. A visceral portrayal of one young woman who refuses to accept the hand she is dealt, it's a topical and controversial story for the 2018 MeToo audience. Girl Alone is a film with a strong female lead - and we have a great name lined up for the role.</p><p><br/><strong>WHY WE NEED YOU: </strong>The team themselves are already contributing a huge amount of their own time and resources for free - but it's not enough to fully fund the production. This IndieGogo funding campaign will pay for every aspect of production that the team and crew are not already contributing themselves. Your contributions will make this film a reality - covering the costs of filming on location with our cast and the post production. Without your help this film won't happen - with your generosity we hope it will not only be a gripping piece of film-making but also a short that can make an impact in festivals around the world.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527195607/ypf0ntrmchjuqjbtrdek.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>WHAT YOUR HELP WILL MEAN FOR THE PROJECT: </strong>We need £9,000 to cover our costs and enable us to produce Girl Alone. Although the team and crew are already being incredibly generous with their time, resources and equipment, we need your help to pay for things like: our cast - and the casting director to ensure they're fantastic for the roles; props, costumes and wardrobe; make up supplies, camera and sound equipment rental; food and transport; location fees and insurance. Every penny you contribute will bring us closer to our goal and help make this film a reality.</p><p><strong>WHAT YOU'LL GET:</strong> As well as the warm fuzzy feeling of helping with an artistic endeavour you'll also qualify for a range of rewards depending on how generous your contribution is. Every contributor who pledges at least £5 will get a reward - and the more you can spare the more special and unique these perks will be. We appreciate your support - and we want to share a little bit of the Girl Alone experience with you all. From copies of the finished film, to a signed script, an autographed key prop, a VIP invite to the very first screening, and even an on-screen role as a character in the film, there are great perks for each and every backer. Every contribution will help, and however much we raise we're hoping to make the film a success no matter what.</p><p><strong>THE TEAM: </strong>Girl Alone is a project we all really believe in - and we hope you will see why as it comes to fruition. For David (Producer) and Linda (Writer) this will be the first produced short, and Girl Alone will be major step for them both as they look to carve out a career in scripted drama. Keith (Director) and Phil (EP) worked together on the award-winning short Rabbit Punch - and have high hopes that Girl Alone can eclipse their previous success and reach new audiences. However, none of this can happen without your support!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526586089/rxpuiiibslmkukhz7vy7.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>KEITH:</strong> I may have spent my life in the past - or rather making films set in the past. For the last 15 years I have been making history documentaries and series for both cinema and broadcast. I even managed to pick up a few awards along the way. However, what I really want to do is put the pantaloons and corsets away! My last short, the multiple award winning Rabbit Punch, was my first foray into contemporary drama. Now, I want to follow it up with a film that will test my skill as a director and surprise the audience along the way. Girl Alone is that film - a gritty drama that will subvert your expectations and show you a different reality.</p><p></p><p><strong>DAVID:</strong> With 15 years in Documentary Development this will be my first foray into producing a fully scripted drama project. Drama is my passion - I even achieved an MA in Script Writing while working full time in TV Development. Girl Alone is the perfect project for me to get my hands dirty working on something exciting and challenging in equal measure.

It's a tense modern day drama with a unique structure, a clever twist and a sting in the tail. A visceral portrayal of one young woman who refuses to accept the hand she is dealt, it's a topical and controversial story for the 2018 MeToo audience. Girl Alone is a film with a strong female lead - and we have a great name lined up for the role.WHY WE NEED YOU: The team themselves are already contributing a huge amount of their own time and resources for free - but it's not enough to fully fund the production. This IndieGogo funding campaign will pay for every aspect of production that the team and crew are not already contributing themselves. Your contributions will make this film a reality - covering the costs of filming on location with our cast and the post production. Without your help this film won't happen - with your generosity we hope it will not only be a gripping piece of film-making but also a short that can make an impact in festivals around the world.WHAT YOUR HELP WILL MEAN FOR THE PROJECT: We need £9,000 to cover our costs and enable us to produce Girl Alone. Although the team and crew are already being incredibly generous with their time, resources and equipment, we need your help to pay for things like: our cast - and the casting director to ensure they're fantastic for the roles; props, costumes and wardrobe; make up supplies, camera and sound equipment rental; food and transport; location fees and insurance. Every penny you contribute will bring us closer to our goal and help make this film a reality.WHAT YOU'LL GET: As well as the warm fuzzy feeling of helping with an artistic endeavour you'll also qualify for a range of rewards depending on how generous your contribution is. Every contributor who pledges at least £5 will get a reward - and the more you can spare the more special and unique these perks will be. We appreciate your support - and we want to share a little bit of the Girl Alone experience with you all. From copies of the finished film, to a signed script, an autographed key prop, a VIP invite to the very first screening, and even an on-screen role as a character in the film, there are great perks for each and every backer. Every contribution will help, and however much we raise we're hoping to make the film a success no matter what.THE TEAM: Girl Alone is a project we all really believe in - and we hope you will see why as it comes to fruition. For David (Producer) and Linda (Writer) this will be the first produced short, and Girl Alone will be major step for them both as they look to carve out a career in scripted drama. Keith (Director) and Phil (EP) worked together on the award-winning short Rabbit Punch - and have high hopes that Girl Alone can eclipse their previous success and reach new audiences. However, none of this can happen without your support!KEITH: I may have spent my life in the past - or rather making films set in the past. For the last 15 years I have been making history documentaries and series for both cinema and broadcast. I even managed to pick up a few awards along the way. However, what I really want to do is put the pantaloons and corsets away! My last short, the multiple award winning Rabbit Punch, was my first foray into contemporary drama. Now, I want to follow it up with a film that will test my skill as a director and surprise the audience along the way. Girl Alone is that film - a gritty drama that will subvert your expectations and show you a different reality.DAVID: With 15 years in Documentary Development this will be my first foray into producing a fully scripted drama project. Drama is my passion - I even achieved an MA in Script Writing while working full time in TV Development. Girl Alone is the perfect project for me to get my hands dirty working on something exciting and challenging in equal measure. When Keith showed me Linda's script I knew this was an opportunity worth grabbing with both hands. I'm sure you'll agree with me when you see the finished film.LINDA: I am a young screenwriter and Girl Alone is my very first full short film script. I graduated from University in 2017 with a Degree in Film and I wanted to challenge myself to write a short, but powerful, drama script.  The story of Girl Alone is something that had been whirling around in my mind for some time before I finally committed it to the page.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Take an active role in the writing of our history.  Let's make the series <b>Ann Maguire: Circle of Heroes, </b>and tell this inspirational story to the world on a big, mainstream platform.</p>
<p>Ann Maguire is one of the greatest heroes that no one has ever heard of.  But we all know her work.  We all benefit from it, in profound ways that have altered the paths of our lives.  In the really big ways.</p>
<p> If you make a living in the profession of your choice without hiding your sexuality, you can thank Ann and her circle.</p>
<p> If your life is free from fear, and unrestricted because of Gay Rights laws, you benefit daily from Ann’s work, and that of her circle.</p>
<p> If you have had a mammogram in the last 30 years, you can thank Ann and her circle for the reliability and consistent quality of that service.  If you, or anyone you know, has been impacted by breast cancer in the last 30 years, you have been helped by the work of Ann and her circle.  Perhaps your life has even been saved by it.</p>
<p>If you, or anyone you know has ever been impacted by homelessness, you have been affected by Ann’s work, and that of her circle.</p>
<p>Do you live in the vibrant city of Boston and share in its quality of life?  Ann and her circle had a part in that too.</p>
<p>Profound, yes?  Seismically powerful, right?  What’s missing?  The recognition, the knowledge, the history.</p>
<p>The names of Ann Maguire and her circle deserve to be household names like other great heroes.  But they are not.  Why?  Because one of us needs to write the history.  No one will do it for us.</p>
<p> So I am doing it.  In a 4 part documentary series.  And you can be a part. </p>
<p>Our history can take its place among the great stories, where it belongs, and you can be an essential part of that.</p>
<p><strong>Ann Maguire: Circle of Heroes</strong> will be a four part documentary series that tells this unknown, but vitally important story, the way it should be told.</p>
<p>Each chapter will be devoted to one portion of this body of work:</p>
<p>1. Gay Rights Politics</p>
<p>2. Somewhere-A Women's Community</p>
<p>3. The Breast Cancer Movement</p>
<p>4. Social Justice, One City Service at a Time.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The high production values you see on TV and the movies require high quality equipment.  The first $10,000 raised will go immediately into 2 areas:</p>
<ol>
<li value=""NaN"">An additional camera and mic so that our interviews will be more dynamic to watch and will feature the requisite flawless audio. You may have noticed that the scenes in the first film containing 2 people simultaneously had inconsistent audio, and in 2 cases the focus was flawed.This won’t fly for mainstream platforms.</li>
<li value=""NaN"">Purchase of extant video and photos from the period from libraries, museums and TV stations.This is what makes documentaries come alive.</li>
</ol>
<p>The next $10,000 will go to a studio quality trailer for marketing purposes and to start studio editing. </p>

<p>You will play an essential role in bringing our history to the world.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Some social movements never really get off the ground. A few do, and make a huge difference in the lives of millions.  This story explains what makes the difference between just wishing, and real world success.  More than ever, we need activist roadmaps and Ann's story is just that! </p>
<p>You can play a vital role in getting this story to the world. Women, and the LGBTQ community have long struggled to have their stories told through a film industry dominated by traditional filmmakers.  This is changing, but much more needs to be done.  I am uniquely positioned to tell this story.</p>
<p>If you are a veteran of the LGBTQ rights movement, you still have an untold story. If you helped build the breast cancer movement, you have an untold story.  If you were homeless, your story is invisible. You can participate in having these stories added to the history our children learn.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is a long road, and there is much work to do.  A four part series for mass distribution requires high production values and marketing.  I am as tenacious as they come.  With your support I will get this done.

I had planned to fundraise before shooting the film, but a last minute production glitch pushed our schedule ahead, and I was left with the choice of either shooting the film on fumes… or not getting this story out there.

However, it would be so incredibly helpful if you would join us on this journey and contribute to the success of this beautiful, gut-wrenching film. I want to list your name in the credits. I want to do this together. And if we hit our stretch goal of $19582 I can afford not only to donate $1791 to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, but also give the cast and crew who work on this film for a discounted rate, each a 10% bonus.  <strong>If I only raise a small part of the money? It'll go right to the post-production crew so this gets wrapped up and submitted. EVERY contribution helps. </strong>BTW, all the stills you see are PRE-color-correction.  <strong>If you can't afford to contribute, please share!</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534405528/mpfnzwutgbjujcwz6ez6.png"" src=""""/></p><h3>Why Does This Cost $16000? </h3><p> </p><p>In reality, this film <strong>should cost a lot more</strong> than $16,000 because we are shooting it on an Arri Alexa Mini and using 1970s Kowa Anamorphic lenses to achieve a classic cinematic look that heightens the overall “organic, authentic, natural” aesthetic of the film. This camera and these lenses should actually increase the budget by about $7000 more than what is listed, but through friends and favors, we were able to get these for much less.  We also saved quite a bit of money by shooting with all natural light, again to reinforce the aesthetic mentioned above, but therefore didn’t pay for a grip truck, a bunch of lights, and a gaffer— <strong>A huge savings.</strong></p><p> </p><h3>Where Does The Money Go?</h3><p> </p><p>So where is all the money going?  We’ve got very well-credited actors working on the film, folks with series regular, guest star, and recurring guest star credits, but there are only a couple of them. And incredible crew… it all adds up! </p><p> </p><p>We hired a Colorist who colored a feature that won Best Cinematography at Tribeca, Guardians of the Galaxy, Captain America Civil War, etc, an Editing Consultant that edited Gus Van Sant’s last feature film that debuted at Sundance, the Production Designer who designed LA Film Festival Feature Film Award Nominee Echo Park, a Director of Photography that just oped on Captain Marvel, and has worked on Baskets, Legion, Z Nation etc, a composer who works for Lion's Gate and such shows as Dear White People, Greenleaf and Nashville, and a Sound Designer who works on shows like The Voice, Beat Shazam, American Idol etc.  Too many talented folks to list in this paragraph, but scroll down for more.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534405592/jpcfubhlemdlc0detccv.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>But the majority of the cast and crew are working for discounted rates so this project can come to fruition.

Despite these statistics, films about same-sex relationship abuse are extremely uncommon. Let's change that.

I’ve written, produced, and directed music videos called “a kick to the gut” by SPIN Magazine and “breathtaking” by The Huffington Post. The sci-fi short film I made last year, Chronopath, was praised by folks at Sundance, and is pending its upcoming festival debut. (Read my full bio here)This film Idyll will have less of a colorful look than my past work and will use natural light, an Arri Alexa, and Kowa anamorphic lenses to achieve a warm, fresh, loving look, as it explores the topic of how best to make amends for past mistakes.

Half of every dollar we earn above our goal, after Indiegogo fees are deducted, will be donated directly to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence. The other half will go toward submitting the film to festivals and other future film related costs.  What’s The Story With This Film? “Idyll” is a romantic drama between two young Latina women, Vera and Petunia. Vera is a quiet, introverted type with the soul of a poet, while Petunia is more mercurial and anxious; her mood could change on a dime.  The film opens on a peaceful ocean-side morning. Crashing waves. Steaming tea. Breakfast. But… Semi-spoiler alert for this paragraph! Our story flashes back and forth between a violent relationship-ending argument between Vera and Petunia at a seemingly idyllic Malibu guest house, and four years in the future when Petunia surprises Vera and her new partner Carol at a vacation cabin in Topanga, waking them up in a clumsy attempt to make amends. There is a reveal somewhere in there, a little twist, but we won’t spoil further. Wanna find out more? Get the perk for the invite to the Cast and Crew Screening! “Idyll” explores unique and necessary themes— Domestic abuse in same-sex female relationships, the shame of memory loss and mental health issues, the proper way to make amends. All spiced with a smattering of narcissism and forgiveness. Visually, we strove to highlight an “organic, authentic, natural” aesthetic, shooting with all natural light, focusing occasionally on lips and eyelashes, and other details that reveal we are living creatures. The Malibu color palette is one of ocean and coral, gardens, and sea fauna. The Topanga color palette is the earthy brown and leaning sepias of falling leaves and willows.  If I Contribute Will The Film Get Finished? Absolutely.  Even though I couldn’t afford it, I took the leap, and shot this film anyway, because it needed to be finished by the 2019 Sundance Submission Deadline of Sept 14th.

However, it would be so incredibly helpful if you would join us on this journey and contribute to the success of this beautiful, gut-wrenching film. I want to list your name in the credits. I want to do this together. And if we hit our stretch goal of $19582 I can afford not only to donate $1791 to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, but also give the cast and crew who work on this film for a discounted rate, each a 10% bonus.  If I only raise a small part of the money? It'll go right to the post-production crew so this gets wrapped up and submitted. EVERY contribution helps. BTW, all the stills you see are PRE-color-correction.  If you can't afford to contribute, please share!Why Does This Cost $16000?  In reality, this film should cost a lot more than $16,000 because we are shooting it on an Arri Alexa Mini and using 1970s Kowa Anamorphic lenses to achieve a classic cinematic look that heightens the overall “organic, authentic, natural” aesthetic of the film. This camera and these lenses should actually increase the budget by about $7000 more than what is listed, but through friends and favors, we were able to get these for much less.  We also saved quite a bit of money by shooting with all natural light, again to reinforce the aesthetic mentioned above, but therefore didn’t pay for a grip truck, a bunch of lights, and a gaffer— A huge savings. Where Does The Money Go? So where is all the money going?  We’ve got very well-credited actors working on the film, folks with series regular, guest star, and recurring guest star credits, but there are only a couple of them. And incredible crew… it all adds up!  We hired a Colorist who colored a feature that won Best Cinematography at Tribeca, Guardians of the Galaxy, Captain America Civil War, etc, an Editing Consultant that edited Gus Van Sant’s last feature film that debuted at Sundance, the Production Designer who designed LA Film Festival Feature Film Award Nominee Echo Park, a Director of Photography that just oped on Captain Marvel, and has worked on Baskets, Legion, Z Nation etc, a composer who works for Lion's Gate and such shows as Dear White People, Greenleaf and Nashville, and a Sound Designer who works on shows like The Voice, Beat Shazam, American Idol etc.  Too many talented folks to list in this paragraph, but scroll down for more. But the majority of the cast and crew are working for discounted rates so this project can come to fruition. So where does the money go? Approximately: 8% goes to locations, also a great discount, 13% goes to permits, 16% to actors, 32% goes to on-set crew (about 16 folks), 17% to post-production crew… hey, how about a pie chart? Oh, and 0000% goes to the director! WHO ARE THE CAST AND CREW?Principal Cast:Petunia: Vanessa E Garcia (SWAT, CSI, NCIS, Stitchers, etc etc)Vera: Andrea Sixtos (3 Seasons East Los High Series Regular, Sundance Quinceañera, Recurring Guest Star on SECRET Upcoming Major Action TV Show etc)Carol: Arielle HaderCrew:Writer / Director / Producer: Jayk Gallagher (2nd Round Pick Sundance Screenwriters Lab & Sloan Commissioning Grant)Producer: Lynette Coll (David Lynch Film Executive Producer 2018)First Assistant Director / Associate Producer: Jordan FerrinAssociate Producer, Fundraising: Sara Mountjoy PepkaDirector of Photography: Ian Clampett (Baskets, Legion, Battleship, Z Nation)First AC: Tanner FieldDIT / 2nd AC: Weiyi AngProduction Designer: Sonja Kroop (LAFF Award Nominee Echo Park, People Magazine Investigates, I'm Reed Fish, etc etc)Key Grip / Art Department Asst: Brandon Steenhoek (Honda, Century 21 etc etc)Grip: Tyler DeneringSound Recordist / Mixer: Jason StareHair and Makeup: Iris Abril (East Los High 3 Seasons, Spiderman 3, Amityville The Awakening etc)Script Supervisor: Eszter Zakarias ( AFI, Underworld, PA / Assistant to Lynette: Daniela AzuajePost Production Supervisor / Editor: Mike Dowling (in-house Paramount Studios 100s of commercials and promos per year)Editing Consultant: David Marks (Gus Van Sant's Don't Worry He Won't Get Far On Foot 2018)Sound Designer / Post Audio: Barry Weir (American Idol, The Voice, Drop The Mic, Beat Shazam, etc etc etc)Colorist: Darin Wooldridge (20 years at Panavision, Best Cinematography at Tribeca ""Kicks"", Guardians of the Galaxy, Split, BFG, Captain America Civil War etc etc etc)Score: Amanda Jones (Giants, White Famous, Greenleaf, Dear White People, Nashville, Step Up: Highwater, etc etc)FLEX GOALS: Our current goal is the full budget for our film.  If you help us exceed our goal, here are some benchmarks of what will happen: $16000 - GOAL - Full budget of the film met! $17500 - $750 set aside for submission fees for 10 film festivals including Sundance Film Festival, and $750 donated to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence $19582 - $1041 for a 10% bonus/raise to every cast and crew member that worked on the project. (Not the director, although 10% of 0 is still 0), and an additional $1041 donated to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence If we get close to these flex goals we may announce further flex goals, like airfare and/or lodging for the lead three actresses for Sundance Film Festival or another major film festival at which the film is accepted, etc, always with 50% of our earnings donated to the NCADV.WHAT ARE THE PERKS?$20 Social Media Shout Out Instagram/FacebookYour name!

<h3><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>The Story</span></h3>
<p>The <i>Last Motorcycle on Earth</i> is a narrative film about a vintage motorcycle collector and bike builder, Conrad Mendel, as he grapples with a new world of technology that threatens to destroy his passion and way of life. </p>
<p>After spending a lifetime collecting, racing, and building motorcycles, Conrad watches as the United States seems poised to turn away from a culture of individual freedom– the right and ability to travel anywhere, anytime– to one where passengers ride in a robot vehicles, trusting in technology to safely carry them to a destination. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After the Supreme Court decides that the Constitution does not guarantee us the right to own private, petroleum-powered vehicles the clock starts ticking toward an outright ban on motorcycles and eventually all human-driven transportation.</p>
<p>This film was devised by looking at authoritarian governments around the world and their real-world actions against motorcycles– banning them inside major Chinese cities, laws against customizing motorcycles in Singapore– and many others. Researching the rapid shift from horse-drawn to motorized transportation in the early 1900s it is clear that a tipping point for long-established forms of transportation– and even entire cultures– can be reached very quickly. The current wave of news about self-driving and autonomous cars is impossible to ignore.</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Our current youth culture is largely focused on virtual experiences rather than the tangible, physical stuff past generations were drawn to– in this case, motorcycles, cars and expression of personal freedom through travel. More young people than ever are deciding against getting a driver's license and interest in ownership of vehicles by that group is at an all-time low. It is said that the last person to receive a driver's license has already been born.</p>
<p>We love the culture of motorcycles and vintage automobiles- they've been a part of our lives for as long as we can remember. There is a major cultural shift, maybe even a culture war, on the horizon– as the world's vehicles go electric and autonomous.  Is this symbolic of something larger?  </p>
<p>The story of <i>The Last Motorcycle on Earth</i> explores what happens if room is not left for motorcycles and vintage vehicles in new transportation systems across the world. What happens to people who have built their lives around motorcycling? What happens when technological and culture shifts are pushed by tech companies, government leaders and court decisions?  </p>
<p>Our story– told through the lives of a few characters– look at these issues and many more. We want this series to start a conversation and act as a cautionary tale, reminding us that the things we value can't be taken for granted. Plus, we think its very entertaining.  Although we are, of course, partial.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why We Need You Now</h3>
<p>This film is not something that corporate America would back. It's too controversial and too suspicious of the motivations of those who wish to see a fully autonomous world. This is a fully indie effort.</p>
<p>We need your support as we raise funds to produce <i>The Last Motorcycle on Earth</i>. the first hour is complete–  and sets up the world, the characters, and the basics of the story. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are filmmakers, but we're not visual effects artists, sound mixers, or music composers.  Those people are talented and expensive to hire.  The budget will be used to pay for all of the various filmmaking line-items that we can't handle ourselves.</li>
<li>Seems like a low budget for a high-production value film? We own a production company with cameras, lighting, sound gear, and most everything needed to shoot a professional film. We have an editing room in our office (which is directly above our kitchen!). Being self-contained in that way makes the actual production side of this project very cheap.  We work small and produce great results.  Plus, we have the support of our local motorcycling community, and access to places that would cost huge money to build.</li>
<li>We have lots of cools stuff to thank you for your help with The Last Motorcycle on Earth.  In the series, Conrad runs a radio show and motorcycle parts business called Motorcycle Mercantile.  After we designed the tees and sweatshirts that Conrad's character would wear in the film we decided they were actually something we would wear, too.  We've made stickers, patches, shirts, hoodies, etc. with those logos.  We've also created some prop shirts that appear in the show that are reactions to self-driving cars.  We think these will be in high demand, since giant killer robots (self-driving cars) are now amongst us.  Kinda crazy.</li>
<li>We also have some higher-end perks that make it possible for you to appear in the show, be interviewed by phone for the radio program in the show, and come to Montana for a motorcycle tour of the filming locations as well a screening and barbecue with the cast and crew at Mort's Motorcycle Compound, seen in the show.  </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We hope this series will make people think. Perhaps start a conversation about how the future should look. Decisions are being made now that will impact transportation for generations to come. The first echoes of extinction for petroleum-powered, human-operated vehicles are beginning to be heard.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Basics – a Review.</h3>
<ul>
<li>The story centers on a small group of motorcyclists facing down the federal government and the tech industry as society is pushed to ban motorcycles, petroleum and transition to self-driving cars.</li>
<li>Produced by professional indie filmmakers and avid motorcyclists.</li>
<li>This show is being made by the skin of our teeth and the thin tread on our tires.</li>
<li>The first hour is finished, the rest is underway now.</li>
<li>We need your help to finish.</li>
</ul>

Our current youth culture is largely focused on virtual experiences rather than the tangible, physical stuff past generations were drawn to– in this case, motorcycles, cars and expression of personal freedom through travel. More young people than ever are deciding against getting a driver's license and interest in ownership of vehicles by that group is at an all-time low. It is said that the last person to receive a driver's license has already been born.
We love the culture of motorcycles and vintage automobiles- they've been a part of our lives for as long as we can remember. There is a major cultural shift, maybe even a culture war, on the horizon– as the world's vehicles go electric and autonomous.  Is this symbolic of something larger?  
The story of The Last Motorcycle on Earth explores what happens if room is not left for motorcycles and vintage vehicles in new transportation systems across the world. What happens to people who have built their lives around motorcycling? What happens when technological and culture shifts are pushed by tech companies, government leaders and court decisions?  
Our story– told through the lives of a few characters– look at these issues and many more. We want this series to start a conversation and act as a cautionary tale, reminding us that the things we value can't be taken for granted. Plus, we think its very entertaining.  Although we are, of course, partial.
 
Why We Need You Now
This film is not something that corporate America would back. It's too controversial and too suspicious of the motivations of those who wish to see a fully autonomous world. This is a fully indie effort.
We need your support as we raise funds to produce The Last Motorcycle on Earth. the first hour is complete–  and sets up the world, the characters, and the basics of the story. 
 

What We Need & What You Get

We are filmmakers, but we're not visual effects artists, sound mixers, or music composers.  Those people are talented and expensive to hire.  The budget will be used to pay for all of the various filmmaking line-items that we can't handle ourselves.
Seems like a low budget for a high-production value film? We own a production company with cameras, lighting, sound gear, and most everything needed to shoot a professional film. We have an editing room in our office (which is directly above our kitchen!). Being self-contained in that way makes the actual production side of this project very cheap.  We work small and produce great results.  Plus, we have the support of our local motorcycling community, and access to places that would cost huge money to build.
We have lots of cools stuff to thank you for your help with The Last Motorcycle on Earth.  In the series, Conrad runs a radio show and motorcycle parts business called Motorcycle Mercantile.  After we designed the tees and sweatshirts that Conrad's character would wear in the film we decided they were actually something we would wear, too.  We've made stickers, patches, shirts, hoodies, etc. with those logos.  We've also created some prop shirts that appear in the show that are reactions to self-driving cars.  We think these will be in high demand, since giant killer robots (self-driving cars) are now amongst us.  Kinda crazy.
We also have some higher-end perks that make it possible for you to appear in the show, be interviewed by phone for the radio program in the show, and come to Montana for a motorcycle tour of the filming locations as well a screening and barbecue with the cast and crew at Mort's Motorcycle Compound, seen in the show.  

 

The Impact
We hope this series will make people think. Perhaps start a conversation about how the future should look. Decisions are being made now that will impact transportation for generations to come. The first echoes of extinction for petroleum-powered, human-operated vehicles are beginning to be heard.

The Basics – a Review.

The story centers on a small group of motorcyclists facing down the federal government and the tech industry as society is pushed to ban motorcycles, petroleum and transition to self-driving cars.
Produced by professional indie filmmakers and avid motorcyclists.
This show is being made by the skin of our teeth and the thin tread on our tires.
The first hour is finished, the rest is underway now.
We need your help to finish.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We're hoping that the Impact of supporting a film employing females only will be monumental in the future of how we make Film and Television. In the last 12 months we have been witness to the beginning of the modern revolution, with females speaking out again inequality and sexism across all industries.

By making a film and employing women only to do it, we are shining a spotlight on an industry that for too long has been accepted as a ""boys club"". The world wants to hear from the minorities now, and while we are only one project, we hope that this film, and the story behind it will make enough of an impact that we start to see inclusion riders on every single Australian Screen Project in the future. </p>

<h3>Why A Story About Alzheimer’s and Dementia</h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">   We are facing a global crisis! </span><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>These days so many people I know are either caring for a family member with Alzheimer's or dementia or are themselves experiencing cognitive problems. And with increasing regularity,  people I admire, many at the peak of their careers, are in the early stages of this neurodegenerative disease. </span>One of the tenets of journalism is to follow the 5Ws and H of a story. So I started asking questions:</p>
<p><strong>Why</strong> are minorities disproportionately affected,</p>
<p><strong>How </strong>could there be no cure -let alone effective treatment when Alois Alzheimer identified the disease 107 years ago,</p>
<p><strong>Who </strong>was this man alongside Alois Alzheimer, an African American -Dr. Solomon Carter Fuller who for a period was a part of Alzheimer’s research team and yet is rarely mentioned,</p>
<p><strong>What </strong>is being done on the scientific, caregivers and engagement fronts to battle the disease,</p>
<p><strong>Where </strong>are we in terms of treatments and a cure?</p>
<p>So many questions. And after watching a host of powerful documentaries about the subject, my first question remained unaddressed -<strong>Why</strong> minorities are affected twice as often as whites?</p>
<p>Certainly and sadly most diseases disproportionately impact black and brown people. Yet there is something singularly unique about Alzheimer’s and Dementia -its soul shattering ability to erase a person’s stories, memories, the essence of humanity. It is a story that cries out for telling. And it is why we are asking for your support in funding our documentary In Search of Lost Time, Alzheimer’s and Dementia’s Impact on Communities of Color.</p>
<p><b>PRODUCTION</b></p>
<p>We are in the early stages of this film project and already it has been so gratifying to receive encouragement and engagement from some of the countries leading researchers and scientists.</p>
<p>Universally all agree this is an important story and they want to help tell it. We have already conducted some of these interviews and will do many more. In reviewing past documentaries I was troubled by the lack of diversity in the experts interviewed. Again,this project will cover new ground. Thus, you will hear from a diverse range of doctors and scientists, women and men who share their expertise and knowledge. Everyday we learn something new!</p>
<p>In approaching caregivers, we have been inspired by their spirit as well as the trust they are placing in us to tell their stories and the stories of their loved ones. We have a lot more work to do. As you can imagine it is labor intensive . We need to spend  hours with people as they go about their daily routines and then winnowing down those experiences into vignettes -being careful to accurately reflect the dimensions of this disease without being exploitive or ignoring a person’s dignity.</p>
<p>And we also want to share the stories of men and women across the country who are taking action. It is an amazing group of folks starting foundations, creating collaborations of fraternities , churches and medical institutions to effect change.</p>
<p> <strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>The story is about communities of color but it IMPACTS us ALL</p>
<p><i><u>In Search of Lost Tim</u></i>e  is a call to action for communities all across the country.Documentary films have the power to change the conversation. When I talk to some of the world’s best  minds, all tell me that if we are to find an effective cure or treatments, everyone must be included in the process. </p>
<p>In other words, the failure to include all populations in clinical trials and in education and outreach  programs, jeopardizes the scientific communities eventual success. In short:</p>
<p><i>“<b>We are all in this together!”</b></i></p>
<p>We believe this film can start a conversation by engaging people on many levels -thorough participation in clinical trials,supporting those in our community who are dealing with the disease, inspiring financial support for research and more.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a stigma associated with Alzheimer’s and dementia. This means too many of our family members, neighbors and friends suffer in silence. Shedding light on the subject, providing information and encouraging dialogue can help change that. And there is a  story to tell in the movement to bring dignity to how the disease is approached: helping people live in the moment and focus on non-therapeutic measures to enhance quality of life.</p>
<p>107 years after the disease was given a name, we are at an inflection point. Whether it is Bill Gates committing 100 million to research or the daily breakthroughs reported in the news, now is the time to do what it takes to get us across the finish line .</p>
<p><strong>THE OBSTACLES</strong></p>
<p>Filmmaking ain’t beanbag! It’s challenging and time consuming. Although I am a journalist with 30 years experience I teamed up with veteran filmmaker Bob Lott who has decades of documentary filmmaking experience to ensure we get across the finish line.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE YOUR MONEY IS GOING</strong></p>
<p>Filmmaking gets expensive, very expensive, very fast. From travel and its associated costs, to the expenses around acquiring footage, a music score, editing color correction, sound mixing and visual effects . After production there is the marketing and distribution. We are asking for your support today so we can see this project fulfill its potential and address a long overlooked issue in our communities. 100 percent of the  funds will go towards production expenses like travel, feeding a very small crew, renting equipment, purchasing supplies,  and then post production and marketing, Indiegogo fees and incentive costs.</p>
<p><strong>BOTTOM LINE</strong></p>
<p>We are asking for your financial support at any level. </p>
<p>If you are unable at this time to contribute money, we completely get it!</p>
<p>But you can still help. Here is how-</p>
<p>You can support our project on social media. Documentaries like <u><i>I<b>n Search of Lost Time</b> </i></u> can pick up momentum through word of mouth.</p>
<p>You probably know someone dealing with Alzheimer’s or other dementias. Tell them about our project. On my website Reneechenaultfattah.com we will list resources and information to help.</p>
<p>This is more than a documentary. It is a movement of engagement, education and support. Every few days we will post information on resources for caregivers and updates on breakthroughs as well as excerpts from our interviews. There is a lot of positive, hopeful research out there, not just on the science front, but in the non-therapeutic approaches that focus on quality of life- helping people see this disease through a new lens,</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Davide Fiore is the director behind A Little Fellow and the inspiration for the search to discover “who is A.P. Giannini?” As a successful director in Italy, Davide’s career brought him to San Francisco for an opportunity to work in the American film market.  As a recent immigrant to the United States from Turin, Italy, Davide spent three months getting to know San Francisco as he awaited the arrival of a work permit. Davide spent these initial months walking through the streets acquainting himself with the city and researching how the hustling city came into being. In this time, Davide came across the name of a fellow Italian immigrant of the early 1900’s; an interesting character who’s name continually re-emerged in San Francisco’s history. This name, Davide discovered, was one not only of prominence and of great impact on the city of San Francisco, but also the United States: Amadeo Peter Giannini.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521000180/ywkc6yvyyt220bumppnh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Scouring the city looking for more clues about A.P. Giannini, Davide found that Giannini not only founded the Bank of America, but implemented policies that define the way we bank today. Not only did Giannini change the banking establishment to benefit the working class, which was unheard of at the time, but he dedicated much of his life to helping others. Additionally, Giannini largely provided the institutions and funding for much of the architecture the defines San Francisco’s skyline today, including the Transamerica Pyramid and the Golden Gate Bridge.  </p>
<p>Despite all this, Davide was shocked to find that most people he talked to had little to no knowledge of this influential man. Because Davide and Giannini’s family both immigrated from a small northern region of Italy, Davide is driven to tell Giannini’s story to the world.</p>
<p>In a global political climate that is so deeply threatening and critical of immigrants and people of different cultures, Davide and the producers of A Little Fellow documentary feel that NOW is the time to tell A.P. Giannini’s story. The story of A.P. Giannini is one of hope and inspiration for all people who call the United States home, but especially immigrants, showing that you can come from nothing, work hard, show compassion, and change the way our country operates for the better. </p>
<p>If you contribute to our campaign you will be a part of our mission of telling the world the story of how an American immigrant created the world’s largest bank with acceptance of diversity and corporate humility. The world needs a story of hope for the downtrodden and poor and A.P. Giannini’s story stands for the fundamental principles of the United States. By contributing, your voice will be united with ours helping to expand our message of courage and acceptance. Help us tell the world that immigrants are not unwelcome, and they are not unwanted. We need all the help we can get. More than anything, we need your support!</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $50,000 in order to start this film. This initial $50,000 will help us show the next rounds of investors that you, our audience, believe in our message and want to see this story of hope out in the world. In order to contend with competitors in the professional film market and to maintain the production quality needed to compete and be distributed at the highest levels, our total budget for this film is much greater than our initial ask. We are confident that initial funds of $50,000 will prove to our potential outside investors that we have the support and interest behind this film to raise the final funds that will finance the film through post-production, outreach and engagement.  </p>
<p>As donors to our film we want to reward you for your generosity. We will provide a range of swag for the film, as well as rewards that allow you to join us on and off set, get your name on screen in the credits, and allow you to become a member of our team.</p>
<p>We have chosen Indiegogo for the unique purpose that should we not reach our full goal, we will still be able to get started. If we do not reach $50,000 we will put the funds towards additional time to market and pitch the film to investors. We know with our collective connections, that if this film is made it will be seen worldwide, but we need initial funding to start this process. We believe this film MUST be made and that NOW is the time to make it. If we do not reach our initial goal, it will extend the production time, lessening the impact this film could have right now. If you sign up you’ll be helping us share A.P. Giannini’s incredible story and spread the message of acceptance, tolerance, and courage across the globe. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>A Little Fellow documentary is not just a film that you may see on TV or online. The message behind A Little Fellow is one the filmmakers intend to carry beyond distribution to start conversations that effect immigrants across the globe. Over the last few years we have seen a pendulum swing to the rise of hate and intolerance towards people who do not look or practice similar life habits as ourselves. The last time this level of hate and rhetoric directed towards individual groups of peoples was so globally apparent was during World War II. A Little Fellow documentary hopes to share a story where we learn that our differences make us unique and that we can achieve great accomplishments no matter who you are, or where you are from.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Who We Are:</h3>
<p>The filmmakers behind A Little Fellow have proven track records to ensure the success of this film.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Every film faces its own unique set of challenges and risks and this film is no different. If we don’t start this film and launch this campaign now, it may take years for the producers to finish this film. This story needs to be told now more than ever because of what is going on in our world. To start this film, we need your support.</p>
<p>In the current age of cinema, independent film is becoming harder and harder to obtain distribution and be seen worldwide. The challenge is that this is not a Hollywood story nor is it a traditional documentary. This is a historical account on the life and legacy of A.P. Giannini that is portrayed through the 1930’s style of the film noir genre.</p>
<p>So what sets us apart? Well for one, we’ve done it before. The filmmakers behind ""A Little Fellow"" have years of experience earning them the proper insight, skills, and techniques that give them an edge over other campaigns. In short, we are determined to make this film regardless of the risks and challenges we face.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the success of the film we are partnering up with Non-profits and Organizations around the Bay Area and beyond that will help us promote the positivity of immigration and stories like that of A.P. Giannini. But with all that said, gaining the initial funding is the hardest step so we need your help on this next leg of our journey.</p>

Short Summary
Davide Fiore is the director behind A Little Fellow and the inspiration for the search to discover “who is A.P. Giannini?” As a successful director in Italy, Davide’s career brought him to San Francisco for an opportunity to work in the American film market.  As a recent immigrant to the United States from Turin, Italy, Davide spent three months getting to know San Francisco as he awaited the arrival of a work permit. Davide spent these initial months walking through the streets acquainting himself with the city and researching how the hustling city came into being. In this time, Davide came across the name of a fellow Italian immigrant of the early 1900’s; an interesting character who’s name continually re-emerged in San Francisco’s history. This name, Davide discovered, was one not only of prominence and of great impact on the city of San Francisco, but also the United States: Amadeo Peter Giannini.

Scouring the city looking for more clues about A.P. Giannini, Davide found that Giannini not only founded the Bank of America, but implemented policies that define the way we bank today. Not only did Giannini change the banking establishment to benefit the working class, which was unheard of at the time, but he dedicated much of his life to helping others. Additionally, Giannini largely provided the institutions and funding for much of the architecture the defines San Francisco’s skyline today, including the Transamerica Pyramid and the Golden Gate Bridge.  
Despite all this, Davide was shocked to find that most people he talked to had little to no knowledge of this influential man. Because Davide and Giannini’s family both immigrated from a small northern region of Italy, Davide is driven to tell Giannini’s story to the world.
In a global political climate that is so deeply threatening and critical of immigrants and people of different cultures, Davide and the producers of A Little Fellow documentary feel that NOW is the time to tell A.P. Giannini’s story. The story of A.P. Giannini is one of hope and inspiration for all people who call the United States home, but especially immigrants, showing that you can come from nothing, work hard, show compassion, and change the way our country operates for the better. 
If you contribute to our campaign you will be a part of our mission of telling the world the story of how an American immigrant created the world’s largest bank with acceptance of diversity and corporate humility. The world needs a story of hope for the downtrodden and poor and A.P. Giannini’s story stands for the fundamental principles of the United States. By contributing, your voice will be united with ours helping to expand our message of courage and acceptance. Help us tell the world that immigrants are not unwelcome, and they are not unwanted. We need all the help we can get. More than anything, we need your support!

 
What We Need & What You Get
We need to raise $50,000 in order to start this film. This initial $50,000 will help us show the next rounds of investors that you, our audience, believe in our message and want to see this story of hope out in the world. In order to contend with competitors in the professional film market and to maintain the production quality needed to compete and be distributed at the highest levels, our total budget for this film is much greater than our initial ask. We are confident that initial funds of $50,000 will prove to our potential outside investors that we have the support and interest behind this film to raise the final funds that will finance the film through post-production, outreach and engagement.  
As donors to our film we want to reward you for your generosity. We will provide a range of swag for the film, as well as rewards that allow you to join us on and off set, get your name on screen in the credits, and allow you to become a member of our team.
We have chosen Indiegogo for the unique purpose that should we not reach our full goal, we will still be able to get started. If we do not reach $50,000 we will put the funds towards additional time to market and pitch the film to investors. We know with our collective connections, that if this film is made it will be seen worldwide, but we need initial funding to start this process. We believe this film MUST be made and that NOW is the time to make it. If we do not reach our initial goal, it will extend the production time, lessening the impact this film could have right now. If you sign up you’ll be helping us share A.P. Giannini’s incredible story and spread the message of acceptance, tolerance, and courage across the globe. 


The Impact
A Little Fellow documentary is not just a film that you may see on TV or online. The message behind A Little Fellow is one the filmmakers intend to carry beyond distribution to start conversations that effect immigrants across the globe. Over the last few years we have seen a pendulum swing to the rise of hate and intolerance towards people who do not look or practice similar life habits as ourselves. The last time this level of hate and rhetoric directed towards individual groups of peoples was so globally apparent was during World War II. A Little Fellow documentary hopes to share a story where we learn that our differences make us unique and that we can achieve great accomplishments no matter who you are, or where you are from.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Candi Core, and Manhunt has been in my head for a long time. Its become a dream of mine to make this more than just an idea in my head. I started in the film industry as an actress, but now its time to pursue my dream in making this film. Ive been on the journey of writing this film, preparing to act in the film and Im proud to say I will be co-directing the film as well</p>
<p>This campaign is important to me because so much energy and effort is being put into this film, not just by me but the great team I have gathered along the way. In my journey that Im still walking, the people who have joined me have invested themselves into the film and see Manhunt as their project too, as much as it is mine. I love the idea of sharing my dream and making it come true with other people. Accomplishing this campaign will not only make my dream come true but it will be a victory for everyone involved.</p>
<p>One of the greatest parts of this campaign, is going to be the contributors. Even the people who simply share the link to my campaign help us immensely. They may not realize, but they are apart of the film in that way because they literally are the link that word travels on about the film itself. As for the other contributors buying the perks, they too are dipping their hands directly into the film itself. These people have the ability to put their stamp on history, for they can say ""I helped make this film possible"" once its completed.

My name is Candi Core, and Manhunt has been in my head for a long time. Its become a dream of mine to make this more than just an idea in my head. I started in the film industry as an actress, but now its time to pursue my dream in making this film. Ive been on the journey of writing this film, preparing to act in the film and Im proud to say I will be co-directing the film as well
This campaign is important to me because so much energy and effort is being put into this film, not just by me but the great team I have gathered along the way. In my journey that Im still walking, the people who have joined me have invested themselves into the film and see Manhunt as their project too, as much as it is mine. I love the idea of sharing my dream and making it come true with other people. Accomplishing this campaign will not only make my dream come true but it will be a victory for everyone involved.
One of the greatest parts of this campaign, is going to be the contributors. Even the people who simply share the link to my campaign help us immensely. They may not realize, but they are apart of the film in that way because they literally are the link that word travels on about the film itself. As for the other contributors buying the perks, they too are dipping their hands directly into the film itself. These people have the ability to put their stamp on history, for they can say ""I helped make this film possible"" once its completed. The magnitude of power,creation, and teamwork, is insurmountable for contributors.

<p><i>An in depth investigation into a company's nuclear secret linked to rising rates of cancer and birth defects in children.</i></p>
<p>Not far from the ocean, but still connected through waterways used for waste dumping, there is a town in the south with a cancer rate six times higher than the national average.  Their children are being born with illnesses and birth defects at a new alarming rate. </p>
<p>This town has a dirty secret.  Actually it’s a Nuclear one.  And this nuclear waste is not only causing a rise in cancer and birth defects in the local towns, but the crops grown there carry that radiation to popular products like Oreos and Pizza Hut.  </p>
<p>There is a public health hazard hidden from the public eye because the companies fight hard to keep the truth buried.  They have been getting away with this for years,  banking on everyone's Apathy. </p>
<p>Until now.</p>
<p>In a true David Vs. Goliath story, locals have decided to take on a multi national corporation as they see their families and children getting sick at an alarming rate.  We will follow the battle these local heroes encounter while fighting for change. </p>
<p>Due to the sensitive nature of the topic, and the need for undercover investigative work, I cannot reveal too many details since the company is already spying on a few on my subjects. </p>
<p>To get to the bottom of this story,  I have insiders lined up, access to information and proof of wrongdoing, and the support and cooperation of local activists, doctors, linologists, radiation experts, and environmental lawyers all ready to help tell the story in it’s whole scope.  This one town’s story of becoming a cancer cluster is an individual story that plays out internationally daily. </p>
<p>The research has been completed, and the doc is ready to come to life. </p>
<p>My name is Erik E. Crown.  I am a documentary filmmaker that has worked in film for over twenty years, and recently completed my first feature documentary “Livicated” and two online media campaigns for environmental awareness with Earthrace Conservation.   After a ten year long ongoing battle with cancer, I decided to focus my work on the environment.  My specialty is being able to obtain proof and video documentation of the story, allowing the audience to see it firsthand.   Last year I was in the Amazon jungle a 1,000 kilometers down the river doing an undercover investigation on the illegal pet trade.  We would go into poacher villages and live amongst them, collecting video without their knowledge and tracking down where the baby monkeys and other animals are sent for the international trade. </p>
<p>When I heard about this town in the South having cancer rates at six times the national average, and an increase in children's cancer and birth defects,  I needed to find out how and why and what we can do to stop it.   With my cancer battle, I have been through radiation treatments and multiple surgeries, and my heart pours out for children that have to endure this.  It must be stopped.  This was my motivation to make this documentary.  </p>
<p>Apathy will be shot in a few undisclosed locations in the south, Washington DC, and the Illinois farmland over three months, and will result in having the documentary edited by April 2019, and on the market quickly thereafter.   I am happy to say I have lined up distribution from Cinema Libre Studios, a company that can guarantee us this public health hazard will become a national conversation.</p>
<p>The budget money raised will go to help cover travel costs, day to day shooting costs, editing, and equipment rental or purchase since we are going to need a few spy cams and other gear to make sure we can get the video we need.   This budget is based on having host families to stay with and not paying for hotel rooms where I can.   I will need to be on location, and possibly undercover to extreme lengths to get the video needed, and the funds will help me cover food costs with my host families, and other expenses.  The funds will also be used for investigation, water and radiation testing, and a few other practical aspects to checking the story.  It will also pay for editing, and the online process so we can get it to the distributor guaranteed on time.  If I do not reach the full budget, we will work with what we have and keep trying.  This story must be told.</p>
<p>If you like this project and want to join me in being part of bringing this story to light, please check out the perks page for a variety of levels of donation and support you can show.  Aside from the physical perks, you will get info as the shooting continues, special updates, and top secret tidbits as the story unfolds.  </p>
<p>If you support us, and don't have the cash to donate, please share the link, that will also be a huge help!  We are all part of the same eco army, looking to the future world our grandchildren will inherit.  </p>
<p>As my Mom used to say ""leave it nicer than you found it"".</p>
<p>I appreciate you taking the time to consider my project, I have never tried to fund a project this way, but in a time where journalism is vanishing, I am hoping that raising the money here will allow me and my team to work in secret and get the best proof that we can to tell the story.

The job market is extremely competitive, and with the growth of social media, young people can hardly help but compare themselves to the perfected reflections of others... for those not in the place they want to be, this makes it easier than ever to become consumed by pessimism and negativity. An appropriate response to this is to dedicate a piece of cinema to the exploration of these struggles and the unique world in which they fester. ‘The King of Spades’ aspires to be that piece.The film is a character-driven drama about friendship, frustration and what it’s like being a young adult in today’s world. Best friends in secondary school, Aaron completed a degree, got himself a well-paid office job, a beautiful girlfriend and a nice London apartment, while John dropped out of university, lives at home with his dad, is unemployed and has grown violent and impulsive with frustration.We follow Aaron as he returns to his hometown, reunites with John and tries to help him get his life together. However, John rejects any form of help other than to find the Volvo driver who ran over his dog, something he seems to have made his mission...  We’d love for you to be part of the project, and we are offering some exciting perks in return for your generosity. Matthew Fearney - Director/Writer/EditorStudying at The University of York, Matthew focused his efforts on learning the ins and outs of filmmaking, largely through extensive practical work, both at University and in his home town, Darlington. Having garnered success with several short films (either written, directed, edited or all the above by himself), he turned his attention to writing a feature script a couple of years ago, the result of which is 'The King of Spades'. Amy Cornforth - ProducerOriginally from Yarm, Amy also studied Film and Television Production at The University of York, where she achieved a 2:1 for her efforts. Throughout her degree, numerous modules were dedicated to production, therefore she has taken on the role of producer on a range of single and multi-camera projects during her time at university. Now that she has graduated, she's excited to apply her skill-set to a feature-length production. Seán Mackey - Director of PhotographySeán is a cinematographer originally from Belfast, Northern Ireland. He studied in a BSc in Film and Television Production in York, where he worked with Matthew on a short film that earned him a Royal Television Society Award for Craft in Camerawork. Seán is currently working as a freelance DP and gaffer in London and is really excited to breathe life into the world of 'The King of Spades'.Luke Thomas C Riley - John GaudiLuke came to acting from a successful career in music and modelling. As well as seeing a lot of himself personally within the character, he brings a level of diversity and creativity that makes him perfect for the once-charismatic and truly individual John Gaudi.Right now, we are in the later stages of development.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Alone On A Park Bench has become my passion project, and I want to share it with as many people as I can. I am at a point in my life where I feel I can finally make a film like this. As well as make it look truly beautiful. I have been in the film world and taking video production classes for coming up on four years now. This is the perfect time in my life to undertake a project like this. With your donation I can make this passion project a reality and be able to create something that everyone involved can be truly proud of.</p>

<p>Madison took an interest in film at an early age, every aspect from in front and behind the camera. Instead of going to a party her idea of fun would be to analyse the inner workings of her favorite films. She was enrolled in the video production program at her high school for three years and competed in several film competitions across her home state of Maine. She also helps run the production company ""Seapoint Studios"" which is locally based out of Kittery Maine.  This is her first proper experience in the role of a Director and she is excited to show everyone just what she is capable of.</p>

<h3>What Do We Need?</h3>
<p>We need a minimum of $1,600 for this films budget. I know that seems like a hefty amount of money to give but a lot goes into the process of making a film. We have to feed our cast and crew, rent equipment, purchase props, rent locations, reimburse travel fairs, and that's just the beginning. With your donation we will be able to put our all into making this film truly special.</p>
<h3>Risks/Challenges For The Production </h3>
<p>We are filming between the months of February-March, And since we live and are shooting in Maine those tend to be some of the coldest months in winter. So it is of the upmost importance that our actors remain safe and warm from the cold and snow. If the weather deems to be unsafe for the cast and crew then we will resort to scheduled backup days for shooting the missed scenes. </p>
<h3>How Can You Help?</h3>
<p>The number one thing you can do to help is donate to the campaign. We have set up perks and rewards to individuals who donate. But, we understand that money may be  tight and donating just may not be an option right now, and that's okay. If you can't donate all I ask is that you share this page with your friends and family, as well as social media platforms. In the hopes that we can raise as much as possible in order to make this film. </p>
<p>Thank You!</p>

<h3>How it all began...</h3>
<p>Maybe you've heard this joke: How many actresses does it take to change a light bulb? Two! One to do it and one to say ""I could have done it better!""</p>
<p>No. Nope. Not our story</p>
<p>We are Kendra and Tiffany, two film-maker friends who, with a combined 45 years of acting experience are super in to seeing other people succeed. So we teamed up, because we felt like we had a story to tell- sometimes our story, sometimes the stories of our closest friends. Then we reached out to some of our most trusted contacts to ask them to help us make this film. <br/><br/>We wrote this story because we found that a lot of the films we're seeing don't seem to understand how women actually talk to and interact with each others. Half of the dialogue in this film was taken from <strong>ACTUAL </strong>things we or our girlfriends have said!</p>
<p>Contributing to this campaign will allow us to make this film and submit it to film festivals. We have a <strong>REALLY</strong> funny, truthful, enjoyable script that is just <strong>BEGGING</strong> to be made, but we need <strong>YOU</strong> to do it! <u>We can not make this film without your help. </u></p>
<p>We have our cast, our crew, our locations, and our script. Now all we need is you!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Any contributions to our campaign will go to a business account and will be used in one of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying our cast and crew.</li>
<li>Feeding our cast and crew</li>
<li>Film expenses (props, equipment, heating costs, etc)</li>
<li>Film Festival Submissions</li>
</ul>
<p>Each level of contribution comes with perks, like producer credit and t-shirts and LOVE AND AFFECTION (no physical love or affection included, just the emotion, which is invaluable). </p>
<p>We set our goal at $3000, but our eventual aspirations are a little higher than that. With around $2000 we can make the film. With around $3000 we can pay everyone <u>fairly</u>. With $5000 we have the finances available to submit to film festivals!</p>
<p>Please consider doing what you can!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Is this a risk?</h3>
<p>While this is the first film that Kendra and Tiffany have produced, they have been a part of dozens of other successful films. Our team, on the other hand, has been the recipients of multiple awards for their work and we would trust them with our literal lives.</p>
<p>Well. Maybe not, like, our literal actual medical lives. But our film lives? HECK YES. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't spare dollars, that doesn't mean you can't help!</p>
<p>Please make some noise for us by sharing our fundraising campaign with your social media contacts, watching and sharing our video, and generally being encouraging!</p>

Los secuestradores buscan dar emoción a sus vidas, pasando las noches para evadir la realidad, apostando millones con el fin de ver quien muere primero.  RULETA es un cortometraje que comenzó sobre el papel hace algo más de dos años. El guion está inspirado en un relato corto del co-guionista del proyecto; Mateo Martínez. RULETA pretende ser una metáfora sobre el conflicto social, la desigualdad y la sociedad de clases. En el proyecto pretendemos mostrar cómo se comportan una serie de personas en condiciones de opresión extrema y cuál es el verdadero rostro de las personas multimillonarias que al tenerlo todo, sólo les queda traspasar las barreras morales para divertirse.Este proyecto se sacó adelante con mucha ilusión después de reunir entre todos el mínimo de financiación necesaria para llevar a cabo un producto serio y estético, realizado por un equipo técnico y artístico envidiables. Por la humildad económica del equipo y la ausencia de financiación externa, la postproducción tiene un proceso lento pero eficaz. Tras 7 meses desde el final de esta gran experiencia de rodaje, tenemos el cortometraje a las puertas de terminar los últimos procesos de edición para, por fin, intentar conseguir darle la mejor distribución posible, tal y como merece el esfuerzo de las 40 personas que han colaborado en este proyecto.En colaboración con TEATRO LAB   El objetivo de la campaña es solventar únicamente los gastos que quedan, correspondientes a la Banda Sonora Original y a la Distribución. Queremos compartir con todas y todos su progreso para que lo podáis disfrutar y analizar en profundidad, aportando una ayuda en un proyecto con tanto amor y dedicación con el fin de que tenga la mejor distribución y llegue al mayor número de personas posibles.     BERRY ESPINOSAEs un joven realizador, productor y guionista, ha trabajado en diferentes proyectos en curso y en post-producción.

<p>Our campaign is seeking to raise $6,000. For full transparency, here's the breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>25% ($1500) will pay our actors &amp; background actors industry standard wages</li>
<li>50% ($3000) will pay the crew and production studio their requested wages</li>
<li>17% ($1020) will feed our cast and crew two meals a day for 8-hour shoots + craft services</li>
<li>17% ($1020) will pay for music licensing, festival submission fees, and props for the project</li>
</ul>
<p>Raising these funds will do 3 important things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make our film SAG (Screen Actors Guild) compliant, which would enable all of our actors to become SAG-eligible and advance their careers,</li>
<li>Enable us to pay all our cast, crew, &amp; backgrounds actors livable wages for their work and time</li>
<li>Submit our film to festivals worldwide to tell a unique and compelling story about true events</li>
</ul>
<p>Hitting our goal will not only help us but also help you. We have prizes for personalized postcards, exclusive BTS footage, accreditation on the big screen, and even props from the set! Click through each of them for details. They're awesome!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We've raised the $6,000. What does that mean now?</p>
<ul>
<li>We do an excessive amount of backflips in celebration and Jubilee</li>
<li>We film the project in July 2019</li>
<li>We lock in and pay all our cast, crew, and locations</li>
<li>We become a SAG film under the SAG Short Project Agreement </li>

<p>Here's what we've done so far:<img alt=""Screen-Shot-2019-05-19-at-12-39-16-PM"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://i.ibb.co/GHc1Gmm/Screen-Shot-2019-05-19-at-12-39-16-PM.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We want you to know how serious we are about seeing this through and done effectively.</p>
<p>With any film, the risk is not having enough funding to create a quality story. We've been fortunate enough to bring on some amazing talent who are ready to go, but without payment, their services cannot be used.  Additionally, without this funding, we'd be unable to create quality content and tell this story effectively. Lastly, because we are making this a SAG union short film, our actors have minimum rates and without proper funding, we cannot accredit our film with this status. </p>

Our Team

  


Our Budget

Our campaign is seeking to raise $6,000. For full transparency, here's the breakdown:

25% ($1500) will pay our actors & background actors industry standard wages
50% ($3000) will pay the crew and production studio their requested wages
17% ($1020) will feed our cast and crew two meals a day for 8-hour shoots + craft services
17% ($1020) will pay for music licensing, festival submission fees, and props for the project

Raising these funds will do 3 important things:

Make our film SAG (Screen Actors Guild) compliant, which would enable all of our actors to become SAG-eligible and advance their careers,
Enable us to pay all our cast, crew, & backgrounds actors livable wages for their work and time
Submit our film to festivals worldwide to tell a unique and compelling story about true events

Hitting our goal will not only help us but also help you. We have prizes for personalized postcards, exclusive BTS footage, accreditation on the big screen, and even props from the set! Click through each of them for details. They're awesome!
The Impact
We've raised the $6,000. What does that mean now?

We do an excessive amount of backflips in celebration and Jubilee
We film the project in July 2019
We lock in and pay all our cast, crew, and locations
We become a SAG film under the SAG Short Project Agreement 


Risks & Challenges
Here's what we've done so far:
We want you to know how serious we are about seeing this through and done effectively.
With any film, the risk is not having enough funding to create a quality story. We've been fortunate enough to bring on some amazing talent who are ready to go, but without payment, their services cannot be used.  Additionally, without this funding, we'd be unable to create quality content and tell this story effectively. Lastly, because we are making this a SAG union short film, our actors have minimum rates and without proper funding, we cannot accredit our film with this status.

<h3>Welcome to the Lollipop Campaign Page!</h3>
<p>             I'm Jared Miller, writer, director, and editor of Lollipop. Nine years ago, I took the plunge and went off to ﬁlm school, at The Art Institute here in Tampa. In that time, I've made several award winning short ﬁlms.  Lollipop is a passion project of mine and it’s something I can’t do without your help. For me characters are the most important aspect of a ﬁlm. The characters in a ﬁlm is who the audience will follow throughout their journey and it’s important for those characters to be ﬂeshed out and feel like actual people.</p>
<p>             I’ve spent over 4 years developing Rachael for a series called Raised on Media. Raised on Media is a series I hope to one day make, it’s a crime series that features an ensemble of characters and follows each of their stories. I obviously don’t have the money or resources to make that happen. However what is in the realm of possibility is to make a series of shorts featuring individual characters in a signiﬁcant moment in their life.</p>
<p>             Rachael is the perfect character to start on because she is by far the most popular character, one of the most interesting characters, and a personal favorite of mine. She has become the gold standard of character design for me and I need your help to bring this character to life and introduce the world to Rachael Sewell.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How Much Does He Want From Us Again!?</h3>
<p>             Lollipop cannot be made without your help. We need at least $10,000 at the bare minimum to make the ﬁlm but we hope to raise much more then that. The money will mostly go towards the cast, crew, props, gear rentals, locations, and permits. When you account for everyone’s time and all the things needed to make a vision come to life it’s easy to see why ﬁlm making costs so much. The one thing I always strive for is quality, the audience deserve a quality product. We need the best to produce the best. With the money we can afford to hire the best and offer that quality. Every little bit counts, so please help us make this dream a reality.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What is Lollipop?</h3>
<p>             Lollipop is a 20-minute narrative short ﬁlm set in the ﬁctional city of Ringling City. A depressed and apathetic young Korean woman named Rachael is badly beaten by a group of unseen attackers. She is given a week to make a decision that will change her life. Rachael drifts through the week by doing her daily routine of substance abuse and self-loathing until she makes the decision that quickly turns into a violent chain of events. </p>

<h3><u>Summary</u></h3>
<p>Joseph has been obsessed with making films ever since early High School and made it his passion from then on. After completing his college thesis film ""Threads"", and his biggest project yet, Joseph knew his next project had to be in the category he loves most, horror. So, he moved out to LA, produced a couple projects and decided now is the time to make his horror short film ""Please Hide"" a reality after gaining more experience professionally. The horror world is ready for a new filmmaker to join the genre and bring in his new, terrifying and exciting ideas to the landscape. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>The Story</u></h3>
<p>The idea for ""Please Hide"" exploded onto the page the second the thought came into the writer's head. The story really focuses on the aspect of a child losing all that he loves and his innocence to a creature he thought was just imaginary.  He violently sees everything taken away from him as the story unfolds. Our main character is a young eight year old boy named Alex who has a pretty perfect life. He has loving parents (Jen and Bryan), a great house, nice room, aka everything he could want until we realize he has a imaginary friend named Jimmy who seems to be always bothering Alex. Jen and Bryan just let their young son go through the experience of having an imaginary friend so maybe they do not understand how much Jimmy is scaring Alex daily and nightly. As the story progresses we start to see that Jimmy isn't just imaginary, he can actually harm this family. Jimmy can physically touch and move things in the world, but seems to only do it when Alex is around. There comes a point though where Jimmy wants Alex all for himself and to do that Jen and Bryan must go. We will let the audience see how the rest plays out. Is Jimmy real? is a question we would like the audience to constantly be thinking until the very end.</p>
<p>A quick look:</p>
<p><i>It’s a somber night as ALEX, an eight year old kid, lays asleep in his bed. His room is illuminated slightly by the small night light plugged into the wall. His room is a mix of clean and messy, while his bedroom door is shut his closet remains slightly open. Alex’s bed faces the closet.</i></p>
<p><i>The night stays still for a few moments.</i></p>
<p><i>The closet door FLINGS open with such force it hits the inner walls of the closet and swings back to a halfway position. Alex wakes up with a jolt. His head moves around the room trying to figure out what made the sound. His gaze focuses right on the half blackness leading into the closet.</i></p>
<p><i>Alex is about to get up out of his bed, but a toy gets tossed out onto the floor. The closet door slowly shuts.</i></p>
<p><i>Alex gets out of his frozen state and goes to pick up the toy. He leans over and grabs up, before he stands back up he looks up towards the closet.</i></p>
<p><i>It’s open again. Nothing but blackness inside. Alex is looking directing at something, but there is nothing to be seen. He slowly stands up and backs away from the closet. Gripping the toy hard, his eyes are now looking slightly upward like at a person.</i></p>
<p><i>                                                          ALEX: Jimmy... no...</i></p>
<p><i>The night light goes out. The room is now fully dark.</i></p>
<p><i>                                                                                                    - </i>PLEASE HIDE (p.1)</p>
<h3><u>The Plan</u></h3>
<p>The film will be shooting in June of 2019. You constantly hear all the time people using their short films as ""Proof of Concept"" for a feature, but tend to not do anything with the piece. This short has was more story to be told behind it that a massive goal for the filmmaker is to expand it into a full feature after completing the short. When writing the short film he realized there can be more done that can fill a feature (and even a sequel), but he needs to show what his direction and storytelling can do before trying to tackle a full length feature film. This film will be another huge step in gaining experience for the entire crew as the project has a lot of big moments that will take great skill to pull off effectively. If everything delivers it would be hard not to give this story a chance as a feature film. Joseph has been in love with the horror genre for a long time and knows this is going to be his biggest and best project yet because he is finally getting to make a film in the category he feels at home in. This film will show the world what he has to offer as a filmmaker.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>Where YOU Come In!</u></h3>
</div><div>
<p>Making a short film is incredibly challenging and expensive. There will be some money Joseph will be providing himself, but more of the budget needs your help! Joseph and his producers; Brandon Mata and Elijah Chandler, have carefully gone through each line of the script, boiling it down to what they know they'll need to tell this story right. Here's a breakdown of how your help will be allocated:</p>
<h3><b>Total Budget: $5,000</b></h3>
<p><b>Production/Post Production: $2,000</b></p>
<p><b>Location: $800</b></p>
<p><b>Production Design: $500</b></p>
<p><b>Special Effects Make Up: $500</b></p>
<p><b>Meals and Transportation: $500</b></p>
<p><strong>Promotion and Festivals: $500</strong></p>
<p><strong>Logistics: $200</strong></p>
<p>We will be shooting the film in early June 2019!</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><u>The Impact</u></h3>
<p>This project means the world to the filmmakers involved and they know that if they can pull this horror film off it will make an impact in the genre and will expand into more. For all of us involved this film will expand our skills in our fields and help us show our voices to the world for future projects. If we secure the funding we need to get this project fully going the ball will not stop rolling and you will see the results! The crew knows this will be a film that will be noticed, so help us be noticed.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></h3>
<p>Having most of our crew already lined up and casting happening as we speak, our dream is to able to focus on the production and realization of the movie by having logistics issues such as production fees, food, equipment, filming permit costs, etc. taken care of.</p>
<p>The  approach of ""Please Hide"" is to rely on the passion, attitude, strength and potential of our filmmakers involved. We want to be able to say that when this project is finished and successful our cast and crew can feel like they were part of something big and special and can see how much their hard work paid off. We want them to feel like this film is just as much theirs as it is the director's.</p>
<p>Whoever knows film, knows that there will be struggles &amp; challenges, but we believe that a production is as strong as its team and as its preproduction work, where the movie is really made. So having a strong foundation as a team makes us very confident we can tackle and situation or challenge that comes our way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><u>Other Ways You Can Help</u></h3>
<p>If money is tight or you cannot contribute to the project during the campaign, just sharing, posting, talking about the film to others on social media will be just as huge! Please share the campaign on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc that will help us reach our goal! Thank you all SO MUCH and let's make sure ""Please Hide"" scares the hell out of audiences!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello! My Name is Chelsea Henak. I’m an actor in my final year at Columbia College Hollywood, a small film school in Tarzana, CA! I’m in the beginning stages of creating my 15 minute thesis film.</p>
<p>When deciding the content for my project, I realized most of the projects I've ever been involved with have been drama, sci-fi, or horror. Those are all amazing genre's in their own right, but what inspired me to become an actor in the first place was comedy! I am truly awed by comedy and its power to distract us from any negativity going on in the world or in our personal lives.</p>
<p>Like many teenagers, I definitely went through some dark times when I was younger. Bullying, depression, self harm, etc. When I was a freshman in high school, I actually suffered from a traumatic brain injury from a sports game, and during the recovery stages, I felt more isolated than ever.</p>
<p>The artform of entertainment really helped me get through all of that; movies, tv shows, music; anything that can help you escape, for even 3 minutes, from your everyday problems.</p>
<p>So that’s why I wanted to be a part of this industry, to help people in the same way it helped me. Happiness can be really hard to find, but once you do, it’s incredible and it’s even more incredible to be a part of someone else’s journey to happiness-- It honestly means the world to me to be able to make someone smile or laugh, even for a second.</p>
<p>In order to make this passion project a reality, we need your help! By donating, not only will you help bring laughter into the world, but there are also awesome perks! Depending how much you donate, we will be sharing 5% of profits with ASPCA Animal Rescue LA Initiative; there is a cat element involved in my film and we want to make sure to give back and help support homeless and victimized animals!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Let’s break it down:</p>
<ul>
<li>$3000 is the goal. This will go toward renting necessary equipment, and feeding the cast and crew, set design, location fees, casting, etc.</li>
<li>PERKS!! Yes, you read that correctly! If you are able to help me out even a little bit, then we definitely want to thank you by offering some awesome perks in the right hand side bar.</li>
<li>If we aren’t able to reach our full goal, we will still be using all of the money we raise on what’s listed above; some is better than none!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project will be the most important project to my career. It has potential to showcase myself for future job opportunities and make my dreams become a reality.</p>
<p>All contributions will go towards perfecting it, so that this story can take off to the big screen, film festivals, and hopefully a career! Also, as mentioned before, depending how much you donate, you will be helping animals in need.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Raising enough money - If we are unable to raise enough money, we might not have a film! Not only would that be heartbreaking due to not being able to tell the story, but I also wouldn't be eligble to graduate.</li>
<li>Locking down locations - Many locations require deposits or full payment/permits in order to secure filming.</li>
<li>Time constraints - Since this is a student film, we only have a small time frame to get the film completely shot and finished.</li>
<li>Casting - Yep, it even costs money to hire a casting director to cast all of the characters!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If monetary donation is not in the cards for you (I totally understand!), other ways you can help are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Liking and sharing this post with friends and family</li>
<li>Volunteering to be an extra in my film! *LA residents only</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you so much for all of your support, and I can't wait to see this project come to life!</p>

So that’s why I wanted to be a part of this industry, to help people in the same way it helped me. Happiness can be really hard to find, but once you do, it’s incredible and it’s even more incredible to be a part of someone else’s journey to happiness-- It honestly means the world to me to be able to make someone smile or laugh, even for a second.
In order to make this passion project a reality, we need your help! By donating, not only will you help bring laughter into the world, but there are also awesome perks! Depending how much you donate, we will be sharing 5% of profits with ASPCA Animal Rescue LA Initiative; there is a cat element involved in my film and we want to make sure to give back and help support homeless and victimized animals!

What We Need & What You Get
Let’s break it down:

$3000 is the goal. This will go toward renting necessary equipment, and feeding the cast and crew, set design, location fees, casting, etc.
PERKS!! Yes, you read that correctly! If you are able to help me out even a little bit, then we definitely want to thank you by offering some awesome perks in the right hand side bar.
If we aren’t able to reach our full goal, we will still be using all of the money we raise on what’s listed above; some is better than none!


The Impact
This project will be the most important project to my career. It has potential to showcase myself for future job opportunities and make my dreams become a reality.
All contributions will go towards perfecting it, so that this story can take off to the big screen, film festivals, and hopefully a career! Also, as mentioned before, depending how much you donate, you will be helping animals in need.

Risks & Challenges

Raising enough money - If we are unable to raise enough money, we might not have a film! Not only would that be heartbreaking due to not being able to tell the story, but I also wouldn't be eligble to graduate.
Locking down locations - Many locations require deposits or full payment/permits in order to secure filming.
Time constraints - Since this is a student film, we only have a small time frame to get the film completely shot and finished.
Casting - Yep, it even costs money to hire a casting director to cast all of the characters!


Other Ways You Can Help
If monetary donation is not in the cards for you (I totally understand!), other ways you can help are:

Liking and sharing this post with friends and family
Volunteering to be an extra in my film! *LA residents only

Thank you so much for all of your support, and I can't wait to see this project come to life!

<p>Somewhere in the French mountains, a family patiently awaited a mother’s death. Days after she passes away, each of those who stay behind is faced with their own kind of loss.

A father holds on to his ratio, while his children allow themselves to dwell in romantic feelings and find comfort in personal rituals. When they start mentioning experiences of having interacted with their mother’s spirit, the father begins to feel left out.

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">WHAT IS UNKNOWN?</span></h3>
<p>Unknown is a suspense thriller that follows a black family of three relocating after the father is murdered. According to the only witness, the youngest daughter, the husband was killed by ghosts. Soon after moving into their new home, their situation turns south, and the same unknown entities responsible for the murder lurk in their shadows.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">WHO ARE YOU?</span></h3>
<p>We are a collective of film students in Baltimore, Maryland, who are striving to push the boundaries in storytelling and trying to bring diversity and authenticity in our industry.</p>
<p>Our collective group includes all minorities: Black female director, female cinematographer as well as a diverse crew and cast. Our protagonist embodies the ideology of innocence and offers young black girls the opportunity to see someone like them on the big screen. </p>
</div><div>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT THIS?!</span></h3>
<p>Young new diverse talent is needed in the film industry, so that we can end the division not only in our country, but the world. Making this film not only will offer people of a minority group an opportunity to build a career in the film industry, but offer a chance for change in our world. We are in a present world of hate, but LOVE is the answer. We are film students who want to use our platform to end HATE and SPREAD LOVE. </p>
<p>With your help we can change the world!!!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">WHAT'S YOUR UNKNOWN PLAN?</span></h3>
<p>We plan to shoot this film in 3 days with a crew of 10-15. We will edit this film the next week after. We will be screening this film for our final project at the end of the semester. We plan to enter this film into multiple local, regional, national and international film festivals. Our hope is to turn this into a feature and begin our film careers.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>SO WHERE IS MY MONEY GOING EXACTLY?</h3>
<p>Your contribution will be going towards Airbnb (Location to shoot), set design, wardrobe, food, transportation, crew and cast. Your contribution will not only help make this film possible, but help three inspiring filmmakers to break boundaries in the film industry, but also change the world.</p>
<p>$1,$2, or whatever you can offer will get us one step closer to our goal of $3,000!!!! </p>
</div><h3>I HAVE NO MONEY, WHAT CAN I DO?</h3><p>Hey, don't worry! We're starving filmmakers too. But you know what goes a long way? Sharing this! We need to get the word out about our project and we would love your finger tapping abilities to spread the news!</p><h3>BUT SRSLY WHO ARE YOU?</h3><p>Okay okay  I'll tell you!

Unknown is a suspense thriller that follows a black family of three relocating after the father is murdered. According to the only witness, the youngest daughter, the husband was killed by ghosts. Soon after moving into their new home, their situation turns south, and the same unknown entities responsible for the murder lurk in their shadows.

WHO ARE YOU?
We are a collective of film students in Baltimore, Maryland, who are striving to push the boundaries in storytelling and trying to bring diversity and authenticity in our industry.
Our collective group includes all minorities: Black female director, female cinematographer as well as a diverse crew and cast. Our protagonist embodies the ideology of innocence and offers young black girls the opportunity to see someone like them on the big screen. 

WHY SHOULD I CARE ABOUT THIS?!
Young new diverse talent is needed in the film industry, so that we can end the division not only in our country, but the world. Making this film not only will offer people of a minority group an opportunity to build a career in the film industry, but offer a chance for change in our world. We are in a present world of hate, but LOVE is the answer. We are film students who want to use our platform to end HATE and SPREAD LOVE. 
With your help we can change the world!!!!

WHAT'S YOUR UNKNOWN PLAN?
We plan to shoot this film in 3 days with a crew of 10-15. We will edit this film the next week after. We will be screening this film for our final project at the end of the semester. We plan to enter this film into multiple local, regional, national and international film festivals. Our hope is to turn this into a feature and begin our film careers.

SO WHERE IS MY MONEY GOING EXACTLY?
Your contribution will be going towards Airbnb (Location to shoot), set design, wardrobe, food, transportation, crew and cast. Your contribution will not only help make this film possible, but help three inspiring filmmakers to break boundaries in the film industry, but also change the world.
$1,$2, or whatever you can offer will get us one step closer to our goal of $3,000!!!! 
I HAVE NO MONEY, WHAT CAN I DO?Hey, don't worry! We're starving filmmakers too. But you know what goes a long way? Sharing this! We need to get the word out about our project and we would love your finger tapping abilities to spread the news!BUT SRSLY WHO ARE YOU?Okay okay  I'll tell you!

<h3>How this all came about</h3>
<p>My name is Conor Molloy and in 2016 I was approached by George Leith to get involved in the writing of a short film. It was to be set in Brighton and was inspired by a poster advertising hypnotherapy by George's flat. He was struck by the comical tone of the advert, promising great things in a mystical, yet budget way, that felt akin to the patter of a used car dealership. This then led us to create a story that centered on a self-help CD, created by a local nutter, Arthur. From this, we brought in our own experience of struggling to find meaning in the transitory space between university and employment and expressed this through the character of Corrie.</p>
<p>We began to shoot Up in Smoke but had to postpone the project indefinitely, due to the unavailability of our main actor and the pressures of full-time work. However, I made a promise to revisit Up in Smoke and make it if I ever got the chance.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2019 and I am over the moon that Up in Smoke is finally to be made!</p>
<p>This film holds an incredibly important place in my life and I am proud to be able to direct it with an extremely dedicated and talented team.</p>
<p>However, all films need financing and we have worked out that in order to cover production costs we will need £700.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>A breakdown of cost</h3>
<p>- £200 for catering, including for two party scenes that involve over 30 extras.</p>
<p>- £300 to pay for travel for all cast and crew, including taxis during 3-night shoots and train tickets to a studio in Ayr where the self-help voice over will be recorded. </p>
<p>- £200 to cover all pre-production costs including travel, printing, and props.</p>
<h3>What you get in return</h3>
<p>- To play a vital role in the creation of this production </p>
<p>- A number of perks including a copy of the Guide to Lucidity</p>
<p>- To monitor the progress of the production</p>
<p>- To support burgeoning filmmakers</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This will allow us to finally fulfill the dream of creating Up in Smoke in a way that is sustainable, adheres to industry practice and that makes the most out of our lovely local area.</p>
<p>We will be updating our page throughout production with footage from the film that allows you to see our progress and further understand our creative vision.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We appreciate not everyone can afford to contribute financially, so any noise you can make about our campaign, through social media or word of mouth is highly appreciated. Spread the news and tell anyone you think may be interested in supporting lowbudget, high caliber filmmaking!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">I'm not someone gifted at ""dealing with my emotions"" as more healthier and mindful people would say - if I <i>feel</i> something negative I thrust those thoughts into the abyss hoping they'll disappear forever but instead they sit in my gut like swallowed teeth, eating at me from the inside out. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I've always run from emotions, run from my anxiety but what if I could no longer escape it?</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I wrote 'The Worst' because I wanted to tell a story about a woman who could no longer run from her fears, who had to look her demons in the eye and <i>speak to them.</i> </p>

</div></div>","A short horror film, 'The Worst' follows a troubled young woman, who after a failing to achieve her life goal, embarks on a long road trip home with her estranged father when a dark and monstrous being threatens her life, she is forced to choose between overcoming her fears or risk losing everything.
After years of an estranged relationship, father and daughter release years of pent up rage and resentment; this boiling pot of emotions contained and pressurized by a late night drive acts as the perfect ground for dark and strange things to occur, for anxieties to come life.
 
 

 
 
'The Worst' was born out of my own messy and ongoing journey with anxiety; this little dark voice that sits deep in my heart that tells me things will only ever go wrong and that it's all my fault because I'm not smart, not pretty, not kind, not enough. 
I'm not someone gifted at ""dealing with my emotions"" as more healthier and mindful people would say - if I feel something negative I thrust those thoughts into the abyss hoping they'll disappear forever but instead they sit in my gut like swallowed teeth, eating at me from the inside out. 
I've always run from emotions, run from my anxiety but what if I could no longer escape it?
I wrote 'The Worst' because I wanted to tell a story about a woman who could no longer run from her fears, who had to look her demons in the eye and speak to them. 
'The Worst' is for all those people that have that cruel and incessant voice in the back of their head that tells them they're pathetic, lazy, not enough. It's for all those people who spend every day running away as fast as they can from it's death-like grip.
What if we stopped running for a moment?
What if we stopped and had a chat with our demons instead, would it be so bad?
 
 
 

 
 
Sharon Mani - Director
The writer and director of 'The Worst', Sharon values films that are able to explore emotionally honest themes but do so in experimental ways. Sharon aims to find a nuanced balance between the emotional truths of drama and the reality bending nature of surreal-horror with her latest short film.
Having dedicated herself to film with a fierce passion, Sharon has worked non-stop to be on as many film sets as possible resulting in her producing and directing several projects since pursuing her BA in Creative Arts at JMC Academy.  From these experiences she has gained an invaluable understanding for the film process and is eager to apply her lessons into practice. 
Sharon's biggest fear is not being able to do what I love. 
 
Lisa Ho - Co-Producer
My name is Lisa Ho and I’m co-producer of ‘The Worst’! I’m drawn to films that aren’t often given the attention in the mainstream as I believe everyone deserves the chance to tell their stories. I believe in my team and am incredibly excited to support them on their creative journey. My biggest fear is letting people down.
 
Lachlan Moore - Co-Producer
My name is Lachlan and I am Co-Producer of ""The Worst"". I am keen to be apart of the project and excited to see where it goes! The Worst is a great story with deep emotional discussions that I am keen to help explore.
My biggest fear would have to be not living up to my own expectations.
 
Georgia Broer - Cinematographer
Georgia is the talented cinematographer for our short film ‘The Worst’. Having previously studied Fashion Design and currently studying for her Bachelor's in Film and Television at JMC Academy, she is able to effectively apply her detailed eye for colour, texture and composition to our film, tying character, camera and world together. She is a strong asset to the team and will enhance the overall execution of the project. 
Georgia's biggest fear is having to write a few short sentences about herself. 
 
Tara Sriharan - Production Design
Tara Sriharan is a 2018 JMC graduate who has been working in production design for just over 2 years. She has assisted in the art dept. on various short films, grad projects, music videos and two features. She's excited to actualise the vision of Sharon Mani, and can't wait to see it on the screen. 
As she has a terrible sense of smell, Tara's biggest fear is not noticing a gas leak that could be fatal. 
 
Stefan Varvaressos-Abdi - Editor
A recent UTS graduate, Stefan Varvaressos-Abdi is a screen writer, film director, and most notably a video editor. He will be assembling and editing The Worst to make it the very best it can be.
Stefan's biggest fear is the potential loss of his creativity.
 
Jordan Kai - Composer
My name is Jordan, and have just recently graduated from JMC Academy, I'm the film composer for 'the worst', and have been writing film music for various short films and documentaries over the years. Mainly focusing on 'epic orchestral scores' but am diverse in a multitude of genres.
My biggest fear without a doubt would have to be drop bears!
