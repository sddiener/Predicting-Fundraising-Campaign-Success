<h3>Truth Beauty Freedom Love, in Eden's Garden</h3>
<p>Sarah McCartney, founder and indie perfume at 4160Tuesdays and James Skinner, founder and designer at Dalliance &amp; Noble are making a matching scarf and perfume, with limited edition paper prints of the scarf illustration too.</p>
<p>The perfume is a soft, rich, lavish blend of iris, hay, honey, apricot, tobacco, vanilla, lily, almond, sandalwood and bergamot.</p>
<ul>
<li>At 4160Tuesdays we've crowdfunded our fragrances before. You help us to invest in the materials we need to make a bigger batch than usual, and in exchange you have the first bottles of our fragrance. For being courageous with a perfume, and committing before you smell it, the quickest backers can have this at half retail price. </li>
<li>You can't just mix up a scent and sell it; here in the EU it has to go through tests and  certification for safety and stability. You're helping us to fund these essential hurdles and launch something new, rare and lovely.</li>
<li>We've always wanted a scarf to match a perfume, and since we met James we knew we'd found the designer for us. Set-up costs for printing a scarf - and a top quality paper print too - are high; crowdfunding means we can get our limited edition off the ground.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>We've already done the creative work...</h3>
<p>Sarah and James have put in the creative time and now need investment to start production.</p>
<p>They met in Sarah's 4160Tuesday's studio in Acton West London, to smell different natural and synthetic materials. The result was a collection of aromas which Sarah took as inspiration for the fragrance. </p>
<p>She named it Truth Beauty Freedom Love, the rallying cry of the 19th Century Bohemian movement or artists, writers and free thinkers.</p>
<p>James illustrated the plants that the materials came from, and the wildlife they support. In the corners of the scarf he's placed the aroma molecules which case a perfumer's spell on the blend to transform it from just a mixture of materials into an elegant, wearable fragrance. He designed the scarf in two colourways, and named it Eden's Garden - a haven for fruit, flowers and wildlife. </p>
<ul>
<li>Your funds go to kick off the production: to buy sufficient raw materials to make a bigger batch of fragrance, to print beautiful  perfume bottles, designed by James specially for us, and to start the scarf and paper printing processes.</li>
<li>To support us you can choose a scarf - indigo or rose (or both), the perfume, or a paper print with indigo or white backgrounds. We're having a limited edition of 100ml fragrance bottles printed with a design James has created for us specially.</li>
<li>We're also having four special labels printed for our boxes, James's line drawings on white; you can colour them in if you like, to customise your individual boxes.</li>
<li>We raising a small pot of funds just to get us started,  requesting your help to make the physical products. We've funded with creative work by doing it ourselves. We shall find a way to make this happen, even if we don't meet the target.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>All things small and beautiful</h3>
<p>This world needs more beauty, and if we can make it look and smell better even in a small way, helping other small specialist companies along the way (including our printers and growers), buying natural perfumery materials that provide a home for wildlife, and giving you an affordable luxury alternative to huge brands, then that makes us happy too.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is 4160Tuesdays' eighth crowdfunding project, and each one has reached its target, one of them got there in less than 48 hours.</li>
<li>Two of our crowdfunded fragrances have been finalists in the Fragrance Foundation's Independent perfume category, and in January 2018 we were named CaFleurBon house of the year 2017.</li>
<li>All this, and we're still really tiny, handmaking all our fragrances in our small studio, which you're welcome to visit.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What if you don't like the fragrance?</h3>
<p>We're making 2ml samples for the less adventurous perfume fans to try first.</p>
<p>There's a chance that this means you'll miss the big bottles if you wait too long though. But if you don't like it - and perfume is a very personal thing, we understand that - we'll encourage you to offer it as a swap or for sale on our Facebook group, 4160Tuesdays News. They're usually snapped up. But we really think you'll like it</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Please your fragrant friends know about us.</h3>
<p>We'd appreciate it if you'd share with with everyone you know who loves a good fragrance, a silk scarf or a limited edition artwork.</p>
<p>Indiegogo have sharing tools here for you to click and send our project out into the universe (once you've secured your own perks). Thank you.</p>

<h3>Queer &amp; Alive</h3>
<p>The origin of this project is extremely niche and more than a little convoluted. For those of you stumbling across this with no prior knowledge, allow me to try and explain!</p>
<p><a href=""https://mia-ugly.tumblr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mia-ugly</a> wrote an excellent fanfic for <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Omens_(TV_series)"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Good Omens</i></a> called <i><a href=""https://archiveofourown.org/works/20395261/chapters/48375457"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Slow Show</a></i>. A group of feral <i>Good Omens</i> fans latched on to <i>Slow Show</i> and formed a kind of pocket fandom. In the original fic, one of the characters publishes an open letter to their queer fans which included the line that if you are queer and alive in this world, then he was proud of you. ""Queer and Alive"" was immediately adopted as a kind of rallying cry. It has been included in further stories and the idea for a pin was born.</p>
<p>All profits from this fanwork will be split between three charities:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://unya.bc.ca/programs/2-spirit-collective/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Urban Native Youth Two-Spirit Collective</a></li>

</div><div>
<h3>How this is going to work</h3>
<p>As much as I would like to sell pins as and when people want them, I'm afraid that requires the kind of capital that I don't have to hand. With a high enough number of preorders, I'll be able to place the order for the pins and ship them out. </p>
<p>Here's where your money will go:</p>
<ul>
<li>Production of 25mm metal and hard enamel pin badges with backing cards.</li>
<li>Shipping costs and materials.</li>
<li>Three charitable donations to the above organisations.</li>

However, we don't compromise on comfort, style nor durability. PICK YOUR STYLEOur first model comes in two different colors - black and white or all black. If the campaign is off to a good start we will let you choose a third color as a stretch goal. D'BRIS fits for all genders and is available in sizes 36-46 EU (5.5-12 US).BLACK AND WHITEALL BLACK  OUR SHOES ARE TRASH Whether the materials are made from oil, organic plants, or the skin from an animal, everything has a negative impact on the environment. The less raw material the better. That is why we use repurposed or recycled materials.   The majority of the outer soles are made from car tires, which is complemented with a mix of natural rubber and recycled rubber scraps. The upper canvas is made from high-quality polyester yarn made from 100% recycled post-consumer plastic. Between 5-10% of this is captured directly from the oceans and beaches by local fishermen and NGOs. On the inside, we have added cotton to increase the comfort of the shoe. The cotton is 50% recycled and the other 50% is certified organic cotton. Same thing with the laces. The insoles are made from PU, EVA, and cork, all recycled scraps from the factory. D’BRIS shoes help preserve natural resources and keep the oceans cleaner.     RETHINK CONSUMPTION We make shoes, but our purpose goes beyond. We want to open people’s eyes to how our habits are harming the planet we so much depend on. We want to inspire others to take action and enforce a necessary change that is long overdue. #rethinkconsumption""We live in an era where people just buy and sell and products are getting cheaper. When you live like this you lose your consciousness. D’BRIS helps transform bad habits into a good one. ” - Pro surfer - Miguel Blanco HANDMADE IN SPAIN. NOT CHINA.  We have partnered up with a manufacturer in Spain that has made shoes for more than half a century. The factory is at the forefront when it comes to sustainability using solar power and recycling leftover materials. Most materials are also sourced close by in Spain. For us, it was vital that all our partners/suppliers in our supply chain shared the same principles as ourselves when it comes to working conditions, fair wages, and time off to enjoy life outside of work.  PERKS SIZINGThe shoes will be available in EU sizes 36-46.Sending products back and forth has an impact on the environment so we appreciate it if you order the right size from the start plus we want the shoes to fit you right. Measure your feet to determine your size: 1. Place a paper on the floor with one side touching a wall.2. Place one of your feet on top of the paper with the heel touching the wall. 3. Use a pen to mark your longest toe in the paper.4. Measure from the edge of the paper (where your heel was) to the marking.5. Look in the following table which size to order.  Don't buy our shoes if you already have shoes that serve their purpose. You can still support us by sharing our project, or donating some money, and let us pick up some trash in return. If you buy our shoes we don't want them to collect dust in a wardrobe. We want them to be used, and for a long time until they are totally worn out. Then and only then we can make a difference. #rethinkconsumptionTEAMMagnus and Joe, Co-founders Magnus is a Swedish environmentalist and has 5+ years of working in start-ups.

<h2>~ Our philosophy. Our goal. Our Mission. </h2>
<blockquote>
<h3><strong>Bringing people's hearts together is our brand philosophy.</strong></h3>
</blockquote>
<p>Our Story Paper Co. is a design and publication startup based in Toronto, Canada with a focus on fresh, stylish and eco-friendly paper products. We want to share our passion for life with you through our curated products. <br/><br/>All of our paper products are printed locally in Toronto, Canada and are inspected and assembled in our studio by hand. We use FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) and Rainforest Alliance-certified paper stocks with recycled content, environmentally responsible printers, and select high quality materials that allow for products that are both well-made and enhance our designs. Everything that we create is well thought to ensure a collection of quality products that we would not only use but are incredibly proud of. <em>You can say that each and every single of our product is made with plenty of love along the way. </em></p>
<p>Our goal is to provide an eco-friendly alternative, as opposed to the not-so-recyclable materials that are easily accessible and mass produced, mainly overseas. This reduces the distance that a product has traveled before it reaches you, thereby reducing the overall environmental impact. It also ensures that the money you spend supports local, small businesses. We want to provide you a place for eco-friendly products that are in the same price range as the others.</p>
<p><strong>Our Story Paper Co. will create eco-friendly quality products that would not compromise on style and design.</strong></p>
<p>This is our mandate. This is why we need you to help us begin strengthening out roots in this eco-friendly campaign.</p>

Nothing makes her more joyious and proud than seeing someone happy with her works. Focused to create an innovative line of creatively designed, eco-friendly and quanlity products. She began with <strong>the modern baby book</strong> , something that she holds very close to her heart because she believes that the precious memories, stories and milestones of a young life should be documented in a well designed book to showcase the unique journey. Having travelled around the world, eco-friendly is something that she firmly believes in because she has seen first hand the detrimental effects of our carbon footprints on our environment.      </p>

<h2>~ Our project. </h2>
<p>We are currently working on a baby scrap with a modern and stylish design to act as a perfect backdrop for your treasured memories.  <strong><br/></strong></p>
<div class=""im"">We dubbed it <em>The Modern Baby Book</em>.</div>
<div class=""im""> </div>
<div class=""im"">Every parent only has so many precious moment's with their child. While technology is the way of the future, it is not a constant. We've all had crashing hard drives and batteries die. Even the e-book is only as good as the energy in it's respective device. You can't share it , and it is only good for one person. True paper and books are shareable and last a lifetime.<br/>Our Modern Baby Book is what you have been waiting for. Why bother with a big hot mess of a book, when you can neatly tuck this one into your diaper bag, between grocery shopping ( for formulas ) or at yoga.<br/>Also, it is completely personalization- friendly . Just like snowflakes, no two babies are the same. This book treats your every need, with photo-inserts between giggles and burps, and lined notepaper in colourful shades for those first few steps and words.</div>
<div class=""im""> </div>
<div class=""im"">
<p>The journal pages are sized at 7.75 "" x 7.5"" in a 9"" x 8"" fabric bound chipboard binder, with a square window in the front for customization with a name insert. It has 56 pages of designed journalist pages with over 100 journal prompts. It also comes with a 12-month calendar to remember your baby's first year. The chipboard binder contains recycled material and is covered with North American sourced fabrics. The pages are printed on heavy acid free archival quality cover stock paper. Our paper is FSC (Forest Stewardship Council), Rainforest Alliance, SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative) certified and contains 10% post consumer recycled content. With a dedication towards economic growth within North America, our baby books are produced right here in Canada using US sourced fabrics.</p>

04/23/2013 - We are so excited and grateful for all the support we have received so far! We are working extremely hard to promote our campaign and we need your help.

~ Our philosophy. Our goal. Our Mission. 

Bringing people's hearts together is our brand philosophy.

Our Story Paper Co. is a design and publication startup based in Toronto, Canada with a focus on fresh, stylish and eco-friendly paper products. We want to share our passion for life with you through our curated products. All of our paper products are printed locally in Toronto, Canada and are inspected and assembled in our studio by hand. We use FSC (Forest Stewardship Council) and Rainforest Alliance-certified paper stocks with recycled content, environmentally responsible printers, and select high quality materials that allow for products that are both well-made and enhance our designs. Everything that we create is well thought to ensure a collection of quality products that we would not only use but are incredibly proud of. You can say that each and every single of our product is made with plenty of love along the way. 
Our goal is to provide an eco-friendly alternative, as opposed to the not-so-recyclable materials that are easily accessible and mass produced, mainly overseas. This reduces the distance that a product has traveled before it reaches you, thereby reducing the overall environmental impact. It also ensures that the money you spend supports local, small businesses. We want to provide you a place for eco-friendly products that are in the same price range as the others.
Our Story Paper Co. will create eco-friendly quality products that would not compromise on style and design.
This is our mandate. This is why we need you to help us begin strengthening out roots in this eco-friendly campaign.
 
~ Our team.
D e l i a    Xiong | Creative Director & Chief Designer   
With the loving nudge and support from her family and friends, she created Our Story Paper Co. Bringing people's hearts together with her designed goodness is and always will be her passion. Nothing makes her more joyious and proud than seeing someone happy with her works. Focused to create an innovative line of creatively designed, eco-friendly and quanlity products. She began with the modern baby book , something that she holds very close to her heart because she believes that the precious memories, stories and milestones of a young life should be documented in a well designed book to showcase the unique journey. Having travelled around the world, eco-friendly is something that she firmly believes in because she has seen first hand the detrimental effects of our carbon footprints on our environment.      
M e l i s s a    Doyle | Community Manager a.k.a PR Girl   
Melissa is a multimedia professional with skills in Marketing, PR and Journalism. She studied at the University of Guelph-Humber, where she received her Honours Degree in Media Studies and Diploma in Journalism. She has always had a passion for social media, specifically the use of Twitter and Facebook.

~ Our project. 
We are currently working on a baby scrap with a modern and stylish design to act as a perfect backdrop for your treasured memories.  
We dubbed it The Modern Baby Book.
 
Every parent only has so many precious moment's with their child. While technology is the way of the future, it is not a constant. We've all had crashing hard drives and batteries die. Even the e-book is only as good as the energy in it's respective device. You can't share it , and it is only good for one person. True paper and books are shareable and last a lifetime.Our Modern Baby Book is what you have been waiting for. Why bother with a big hot mess of a book, when you can neatly tuck this one into your diaper bag, between grocery shopping ( for formulas ) or at yoga.Also, it is completely personalization- friendly . Just like snowflakes, no two babies are the same. This book treats your every need, with photo-inserts between giggles and burps, and lined notepaper in colourful shades for those first few steps and words.
 

The journal pages are sized at 7.75 "" x 7.5"" in a 9"" x 8"" fabric bound chipboard binder, with a square window in the front for customization with a name insert. It has 56 pages of designed journalist pages with over 100 journal prompts. It also comes with a 12-month calendar to remember your baby's first year. The chipboard binder contains recycled material and is covered with North American sourced fabrics. The pages are printed on heavy acid free archival quality cover stock paper. Our paper is FSC (Forest Stewardship Council), Rainforest Alliance, SFI (Sustainable Forestry Initiative) certified and contains 10% post consumer recycled content. With a dedication towards economic growth within North America, our baby books are produced right here in Canada using US sourced fabrics.
 


~ It's all in the Details.
Check our gallery for more pictures of our baby book and name insert details. 
We regularly updates our blog, so be sure to check us out there as well! http://ourstorypaperco.com/blog

 
~ Why $2500? The Break Down
* To produce our first print run, there is a minimum production quantity requirement from our printing and manufaturing partners. Here is our breakdown. 
$1300 - binders to make the books for our first print run$800 - printing (for our first run)$300 - fabric for binder covering (our first run)$100  - incidentals 
*$2500 only covers the basic costs of our first production run.  Any additional funds that we raise with your help, would go towards research and development of new products, so we continue to bring you beautiful innovative modern eco-friendly products. We have so many ideas, help us achieve them and be part of our eco-friendly mission. 
 
~ Awesome Perks just for you!
Please do check out our gallery as well for more information & updates!

<h3>A Little About Me</h3>
<p>Before I start asking for your money, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Alex Miller and I dove into the world of graphic design a few years ago. I've come pretty far in a short amount of time if I don't say so myself.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>A good workspace, needs improvement </h3>
<p>I have built up a decent workspace by selling my old Nexus 7 and some other things to build a designers PC. These days, I'm kicking myself for thinking I could just grab another tablet as soon as work picked up. </p>
<p>I've been commissioned to help redesign the UI of a popular Android app. To do this properly I need to, among many other things, test out the experience for myself. On a variety of devices. </p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign you will help my workflow immensely and allow me to broaden my spectrum of clientele as well as help me deliver a more organic user experience for them.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Basically, I need a tablet...</h3>I don't actually need $800.00. I really only need around $400.00 for an Asus Nexus 7 and some <a href=""http://www.uistencils.com/collections/android"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Android specific design tools</a>, but a 10 inch tablet will be necessary in the future so if I can hit that goal that would be awesome, if not, that's cool too.<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> </span><p></p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<div>My Name is Isaac A, I am the Owner and Founder of UniversalMindFuck Clothing Company. I began the thinking Process for the Brand in 2007 and began creating Actual products in the spring of 2011 in Buffalo,Ny. </div>
<div>I began the company with a simple vision in mind, to get the consumer to once again think about the product they buy and wear. i started out releasing one t-shirt that quickly turned into another, done in 6 colorways. I was Fortunate enough  to be able to release  spring and summer Collections consisting of 2-4 tees in different colorways. Now my plan is to release a Full contemporary line consisting of 10 different T-shirt designs as well as 6-8 different sweaters (Hoodies,Pull-Overs,Crew-necks, Etc) as well as Hats and Accessories. My problem herein lies in that All my Finances are wrapped up in product or Bills.</div>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The intended Impact of my Campaign is to have others begin to use their minds again. Many, Many clothing brands simply have you buy their products with no real thought nor intended relationship. With this brand we want you to know what we mean with everything, and receive constant feedback from the consumer be it good,bad, or indifferent.  If the Campaign doesn't happen, The line will be released one way or another through the grace of God. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>NOT ONE CENT OF ANYTHING DONATED WILL GO INTO MY POCKET. </p>
<p>It will go Directly into production of one of many products I intend to sell for the upcoming Fall Season. Currently I have no other means of funding and anything is appreciated to help Bring to the light a dream and Vision of a Visionary Man. For this reason i need Roughly 6,000 To pay for Production costs, Shipping, and Manufacturing of the various Things I Plan to release. If anything is received and the Goal isn't reached something will still be accomplished regardless. i was able to turn $130 worth of T-shirts into 3 Releases of Tees worth Thousands. If you Decide to Donate the benefits will be plenty. Donations of $49 and less receive a 25% discount the overall Purchases made on our Website, and Donations of $50+ will receive a free article of Merchandise that you get to Choose, being that your Contribution Made it all possible.  </p>

With this brand we want you to know what we mean with everything, and receive constant feedback from the consumer be it good,bad, or indifferent.  If the Campaign doesn't happen, The line will be released one way or another through the grace of God. 



What We Need & What You Get
NOT ONE CENT OF ANYTHING DONATED WILL GO INTO MY POCKET. 
It will go Directly into production of one of many products I intend to sell for the upcoming Fall Season. Currently I have no other means of funding and anything is appreciated to help Bring to the light a dream and Vision of a Visionary Man. For this reason i need Roughly 6,000 To pay for Production costs, Shipping, and Manufacturing of the various Things I Plan to release. If anything is received and the Goal isn't reached something will still be accomplished regardless. i was able to turn $130 worth of T-shirts into 3 Releases of Tees worth Thousands. If you Decide to Donate the benefits will be plenty. Donations of $49 and less receive a 25% discount the overall Purchases made on our Website, and Donations of $50+ will receive a free article of Merchandise that you get to Choose, being that your Contribution Made it all possible.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I make them available on my etsy shop (and with your help, hopefully in the future on my own website), where you can buy them and get them instantly available.

Lillis Paper Designs
The Story
I love designing and creating invitations or Christmas cards that are easily adapted to your own events and languages and can be printed at home. 
It started as me loving to play around with Photoshop. I started to learn more and more, and by the end of High School, I created our poster for Prom. I was so excited to see my creation printed out in big, hanging from all the walls. Family and friends started to ask for invitations and I started to make them… I instantly fell in love with it. I tried to learn more and more about the necessary tools and now I'm finally trying to make this a real project, creating Lillis Paper Designs. Easy at home printable invitations or greeting cards. You just adjust the text to your event and send it to print: Voilà!
Your Help
But as life is, design is not an easy area to grab foot. And this is where indiegogo comes in. I hoped though this to raise enough to at least start with the basic: pay fees, get my website, etc., which I can't afford to pay since I'm paying college.





How does this work?
It's super easy!
I design the invitations and make them PDF's. Mostly you can simply edit the content to fit your event. For example, you can change the names, text, location, or on a greeting card you can change the text to your language.
I make them available on my etsy shop (and with your help, hopefully in the future on my own website), where you can buy them and get them instantly available. There are always both A4 and US Letter sizes, so everybody is included. For greeting cards, I also make a pdf that allows to be printed on moo.com.
Instructions:
1) Open the PDF with Acrobat Reader (Please make sure you use Acrobat Reader, if you don't have it, it is free to download and install)2) To guide you through which fields can be edited, click on ""highlight fields"" on top. The editable fields will turn blue.3) Edit the names and text, so it will fit your event.4) Print out as many invitations as you need. 5) Now it's time to cut the invitations, following the guides.

<p>PureWrist
gave $1,171.47 this campaign to <b>The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society. It
averages out to $6.13/person.  Our
projections indicate that roughly 40 cents per month from the subscription will
be donated to LLS for Gratitude account holders that continue to use PureWrist
and keep Gratitude activated. </b>PureWrist will continue to add more non
profits after the IndieGogo campaign. Users will be able to pick their charity
of choice in the future.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>PureWrist </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">PureWrist integrates a reloadable prepaid MasterCard that is manufactured into a small mini form with a <b>cutting edge antenna </b>and securely inserted into your PureWrist bracelet.  </p>
<p>The mini card with special antenna is personalized, activation ready, and inserted into your bracelet before you receive the product.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p><b>The card in the bracelet IS NOT A CREDIT CARD!</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b>It is a reloadable prepaid MasterCard!</b></p>
<p><b>Because this is a prepaid card there is NO CREDIT APPROVAL NEEDED!</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b><b>The account </b>is SECURE.  </b></p>
<p>The online account dashboard has SSL encryption for extra security on the web. Each account has a personal pin attached to prevent fraud.  </p>
<p>
Funds loaded on to your Gratitude card are FDIC
insured through Sunrise Banks, NA.. <b>Therefore, if you lose your bracelet the funds are protected.</b>  Simply notify customer support and your account will be blocked.  </p>
<p>You are able to easily load funds by connecting your bracelet account to a bank account or even your PayPal account.  </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<br/>
<p>After PureWrist waives your first month subscription fee when the card is activated, there is a very small meaningful subscription fee of $4.99/mo. This will continue to keep the system personalized and activated.<b> <b>Our projections indicate that roughly 40 cents per month from the subscription will be donated to LLS for Gratitude card holders that continue to use PureWrist and keep Gratitude activated. </b>This means that when you are paying the subscription fee you are helping support PureWrist revenues.  In turn PureWrist will be giving some of the subscription fee to charity. Not a lot, but just a little, at the end of the day everything adds up. </b></p>
You can opt out of this subscription fee at any time and the account will be closed and a check will be mailed for the remaining balance. When this happens the bracelet will loose it's payment functionality.  </div><div>

</div><div>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">All PureWrist products displayed were put together by suppliers who will supply bulk production. We’re currently gearing up the manufactures and are ready to meet the estimated delivery times.  We are anticipating the system and product will be ready for September delivery.  </span></p>
<p><i>Forecasting Risk</i></p>
<p>We’ve done our very best to forecast demand and create a solid plan. We’ve learned a lot from listening to some of the key players in accessory manufacture, card manufacture, secure fulfillment, and banking, but sometimes forecasts don’t always hit the mark. </p>
<p><i>Supply Chain Risk</i></p>
<p>We’ve built an ecosystem of capable suppliers who have collectively produced and shipped millions of units. However, component delays and unexpected shortages can occur. If this happens, we’ll be sure to keep you informed and work to quickly solve the problem.</p>

</div><p></p><p><span><b>UNITED STATES PAYMENT SYSTEMS GENERAL FAQ:</b></span></p><p><i>*This is simple information and how it relates to acceptance of the PureWrist and Your card account</i></p><p><i>**EMV is a registered trademark in the U.S. and other countries and an unregistered trademark elsewhere. The EMV trademark is owned by EMVCo.</i></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>October 1, 2015: A Date to Remember</b></p><p>Starting on October 1, the liability for fraudulent, in-person payments will begin to shift to the merchant from a Bank. If an EMV card is used in a transaction at a business that does not accept chip and pin payments the merchant can be liable for the transaction.</p><p>Because of Association liability rule shifts
going into place on October 1<sup>st</sup>, it’s anticipated that more
merchants will begin using CONTACTLY/NFC ready terminals.</p><br/><p><b>What Is EMV?</b></p><p>EMV is a global payment system that entails putting a microprocessor chip into cards, making them less vulnerable to fraud for in-person transactions. Because EMV uses better data security, this standard is being adopted in the United States. In addition, many debit and credit cards will be reissued to their holders with EMV chips by October 2015 and into 2016. EMV systems are already in use all over the world and growing more and more popular.  </p><p><b>What are Contactless Payments?</b></p><p>Contactless payments are completed by a “tap” to the checkout terminal instead of a “swipe” of the card. This card with special antenna is inserted into our designed and secure pocket on the PureWrist bracelet.  It’s so seamless that you can’t even tell from the naked eye there is a payment enabled device.  We tried to keep it as design and fashion focused as possible.  This small contactless enabled card communicates with the terminal just like a regular shaped contactless enabled card.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><span><b>General FAQ:</b></span></p><p><i>Will you ship internationally?</i></p><p>No, Only shipping to the USA.  </p><p><i style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Criteria to sign up for account?</i><br/></p><div>
<p></p>
<p>
In order to sign up for the Gratitude
Contactless Prepaid MasterCard, you will need to verify your identity.**</p>
<p><i>What are shipping fees?</i></p>
<p>PureWrist pays for shipping.  No shipping cost.</p>
<p><i>Is the subscription the only fee?</i></p>
<p>There are no other fees that are charged for using  the card.  The user is responsible for lost or stolen replacements.  There is a cardholder agreement that includes all conditions that comes with the card.  There are international fees if you use your card across the world just a like any other credit debit card. The full list of fees are outlined in the Terms and Conditions, which would be provided prior to account opening.</p>
<p><i>Can I cancel my Subscription Fee?</i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Subscription Fee is required in order to use the
Gratitude Prepaid MasterCard. If you opt out of paying the subscription fee, your account
will be closed, and remaining funds on your card will be returned to you via
check. The bracelet is yours to keep.</p>

<p><b>Charity Affiliation:</b></p>
<p><i>How is PureWrist affiliated with charity?</i></p>
<p>PureWrist has built into its mission to fund charity and increase overall advocacy by the continued use of the card  as a Meaningful Way to Pay. The first charity being Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society.</p>
<p><i>How does PureWrist track this?</i></p>
<p>When receiving your PureWrist bracelet each user will be connected to a charity in our database and this provides a seamless way to track usage in our system and make sure that that charity receives their donation at the end of the month.  </p>
<p><i>How does PureWrist fund charity?</i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>
</b></p>
<p>Our projections indicate that roughly 40 cents per month from the
subscription will be donated to LLS for Gratitude account holders that continue
to use PureWrist and keep Gratitude activated. This means that when you
are paying the subscription you are helping support PureWrist revenues. 
In turn PureWrist will be giving some of the subscription fee to charity. Not a
lot, but just a little, at the end of the day everything adds up. </p>
<p><i>How can I trust PureWrist is adhering to a high standard?</i></p>
<p>PureWrist prides itself on integrity that is set forth by it’s founders.  PureWrist vets each charity that it gives to and ensures that they are operating as a 501c3 not for profit business.  Only trusted charities that have integrity will be part of the PureWrist ecosystem.  PureWrist works with certified accounting professionals to make sure giving is done properly.  Charities that PureWrist works with are accredited and meet standards of<a href=""http://www.give.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.give.org/</a> a Better Business Bureau Alliance that vets charities.

Our Mission: Enhancing advocacy with innovative payment solutions



PureWrist
gave $1,171.47 this campaign to The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. It
averages out to $6.13/person.  Our
projections indicate that roughly 40 cents per month from the subscription will
be donated to LLS for Gratitude account holders that continue to use PureWrist
and keep Gratitude activated. PureWrist will continue to add more non
profits after the IndieGogo campaign. Users will be able to pick their charity
of choice in the future.

PureWrist 
PureWrist integrates a reloadable prepaid MasterCard that is manufactured into a small mini form with a cutting edge antenna and securely inserted into your PureWrist bracelet.  
The mini card with special antenna is personalized, activation ready, and inserted into your bracelet before you receive the product.


The mini card adheres to extremely strict international regulatory standards validating a defined set of electrical, mechanical, and communication protocol characteristics.  






The card in the bracelet IS NOT A CREDIT CARD!

It is a reloadable prepaid MasterCard!
Because this is a prepaid card there is NO CREDIT APPROVAL NEEDED!


The account is SECURE.  
The online account dashboard has SSL encryption for extra security on the web. Each account has a personal pin attached to prevent fraud.  

Funds loaded on to your Gratitude card are FDIC
insured through Sunrise Banks, NA.. Therefore, if you lose your bracelet the funds are protected.  Simply notify customer support and your account will be blocked.  
You are able to easily load funds by connecting your bracelet account to a bank account or even your PayPal account.  




After PureWrist waives your first month subscription fee when the card is activated, there is a very small meaningful subscription fee of $4.99/mo. This will continue to keep the system personalized and activated. Our projections indicate that roughly 40 cents per month from the subscription will be donated to LLS for Gratitude card holders that continue to use PureWrist and keep Gratitude activated. This means that when you are paying the subscription fee you are helping support PureWrist revenues.  In turn PureWrist will be giving some of the subscription fee to charity. Not a lot, but just a little, at the end of the day everything adds up. 
You can opt out of this subscription fee at any time and the account will be closed and a check will be mailed for the remaining balance. When this happens the bracelet will loose it's payment functionality.  





No searching through your bag, pockets, or wallet. No pressing buttons or using an app. Keep it simple with a tap of your wrist!
The PureWrist bracelets and cards are water resistant.




No compromise: It Just Makes Sense
Your continued use of PureWrist as a way to pay enables PureWrist to  give back to charity.
PureWrist is great for those who live an active lifestyle. Runners, skateboarders, surfers, and bikers!



PureWrist is water resistant!  So you can shower or jump in the water with it on.




Out for that beautiful morning or afternoon run?  Bike ride? Walk?




Going to the beach?




On the go during the day at the office?
These are just a few of the many scenarios where your PureWrist bracelet can be enjoyed.
PureWrist is designed to be worn on its own or easily stacked with other wristwear to enhance your sense of style.
For those who live in Chicago or Philadelphia metropolitan areas you are able to use PureWrist to pay-as-you-go for rides on those transit systems where ever you see contactless payment symbols.

Risks & Challenges

All PureWrist products displayed were put together by suppliers who will supply bulk production. We’re currently gearing up the manufactures and are ready to meet the estimated delivery times.  We are anticipating the system and product will be ready for September delivery.  
Forecasting Risk
We’ve done our very best to forecast demand and create a solid plan. We’ve learned a lot from listening to some of the key players in accessory manufacture, card manufacture, secure fulfillment, and banking, but sometimes forecasts don’t always hit the mark. 
Supply Chain Risk
We’ve built an ecosystem of capable suppliers who have collectively produced and shipped millions of units. However, component delays and unexpected shortages can occur. If this happens, we’ll be sure to keep you informed and work to quickly solve the problem.



UNITED STATES PAYMENT SYSTEMS GENERAL FAQ:*This is simple information and how it relates to acceptance of the PureWrist and Your card account**EMV is a registered trademark in the U.S. and other countries and an unregistered trademark elsewhere. The EMV trademark is owned by EMVCo.October 1, 2015: A Date to RememberStarting on October 1, the liability for fraudulent, in-person payments will begin to shift to the merchant from a Bank. If an EMV card is used in a transaction at a business that does not accept chip and pin payments the merchant can be liable for the transaction.Because of Association liability rule shifts
going into place on October 1st, it’s anticipated that more
merchants will begin using CONTACTLY/NFC ready terminals.What Is EMV?EMV is a global payment system that entails putting a microprocessor chip into cards, making them less vulnerable to fraud for in-person transactions. Because EMV uses better data security, this standard is being adopted in the United States. In addition, many debit and credit cards will be reissued to their holders with EMV chips by October 2015 and into 2016. EMV systems are already in use all over the world and growing more and more popular.  What are Contactless Payments?Contactless payments are completed by a “tap” to the checkout terminal instead of a “swipe” of the card. This card with special antenna is inserted into our designed and secure pocket on the PureWrist bracelet.  It’s so seamless that you can’t even tell from the naked eye there is a payment enabled device.  We tried to keep it as design and fashion focused as possible.  This small contactless enabled card communicates with the terminal just like a regular shaped contactless enabled card.General FAQ:Will you ship internationally?No, Only shipping to the USA.  Criteria to sign up for account?


In order to sign up for the Gratitude
Contactless Prepaid MasterCard, you will need to verify your identity.**
What are shipping fees?
PureWrist pays for shipping.  No shipping cost.
Is the subscription the only fee?
There are no other fees that are charged for using  the card.  The user is responsible for lost or stolen replacements.  There is a cardholder agreement that includes all conditions that comes with the card.  There are international fees if you use your card across the world just a like any other credit debit card. The full list of fees are outlined in the Terms and Conditions, which would be provided prior to account opening.
Can I cancel my Subscription Fee?




The Subscription Fee is required in order to use the
Gratitude Prepaid MasterCard. If you opt out of paying the subscription fee, your account
will be closed, and remaining funds on your card will be returned to you via
check. The bracelet is yours to keep.






Charity Affiliation:
How is PureWrist affiliated with charity?
PureWrist has built into its mission to fund charity and increase overall advocacy by the continued use of the card  as a Meaningful Way to Pay. The first charity being Leukemia & Lymphoma Society.
How does PureWrist track this?
When receiving your PureWrist bracelet each user will be connected to a charity in our database and this provides a seamless way to track usage in our system and make sure that that charity receives their donation at the end of the month.  
How does PureWrist fund charity?




Our projections indicate that roughly 40 cents per month from the
subscription will be donated to LLS for Gratitude account holders that continue
to use PureWrist and keep Gratitude activated. This means that when you
are paying the subscription you are helping support PureWrist revenues. 
In turn PureWrist will be giving some of the subscription fee to charity. Not a
lot, but just a little, at the end of the day everything adds up. 
How can I trust PureWrist is adhering to a high standard?

</div><p><b>About Marilyn Johnson &amp; her Studio</b></p>
<p>I started The Marilyn
Johnson Sewing Design Studio back in 1998 from the basement of my home. As far
back as I can remember my fingers have itched to make things. My grandmother
put the first threaded needle in my hands when I was about seven years old and
taught me some simple embroidery stitches. Since then I have wanted to gobble
up anything and everything to do with fabric and fashion.</p>
<p> By 2002 I had
outgrown my space at home and began seriously looking into moving to a
commercial location. I have many people to thank, especially Dan Stacier and
Ron Xifo, for steering me in the right direction, giving me heads up on
available locations and sharing their wisdom with me. When I first arrived at Unit E
at 154 Lafayette Avenue in Laurel, MD I looked into the grease covered auto repair shop that
still had hoists and trucks in it and knew I had found a new home for my
business.  Thanks to the skills and
dedication of my husband and sons, we were able to remove the layers of grease and grime and created the potential for a place where my passion and I could
continue to grow. I spent eleven great years in Unit E working toward my
goals; I made it through the worst of the Great Recession and watched my kids
grow and start families of their own, all the while growing my business and
gaining a reputation of perfectionism and creative solutions with my clientele.</p>
<p>By 2013 my staff, my
costume stock, and my client base had multiplied several times over their
2002 numbers. We were bursting at the seams, and in the hottest summer in
recent memory, we really needed a space with air conditioning.  In order to make the next step to truly
pamper (and not melt) our clientele, we needed more space.  We moved across the parking lot to Units K
and J. </p>
<p>With all the
additional space in the new studio, I was able to expand my business in several
directions by making official the “Sewing School” so many had asked for as well
as really developing a full-service costume closet of custom costumes and rentals for
theater and re-enactors with a mascot or two thrown in. Unit K is the client
side, where we pamper and fawn over our clients. Unit J is our costume closet, where we store our hundreds of costumes for
all occasions.</p>
<p>However, the past few
years have been challenging due to changes in the economy. We have our peak seasons
(Spring: Bridal/Prom, Fall: Bridal/Halloween), and the in-between months of alterations as our bread and butter. This income alone is not always enough
to cover the expenses of garment building and maintenance, let alone to allow us to take that next big leap. Now we need the capital to grow and bring in the costume clientele to match the level of our custom clientele.</p>
<p><b>What the Studio Needs &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a large
closet of costumes for rent and we love it because it consists of rare,
unique and vintage pieces, as well as complex costumes we have built in-house. However,
this closet takes up a large portion of our studio and overhead, and we need the capital to advertise and market it effectively.</p>
<p>Our Studio rent is
$3,000 a month and the past several months have proven difficult in making ends
meet. We do not want to give up our costume closet, as it took 16 years to
build, and it is a personal passion of mine to provide beautifully built,
clean, and creative costumes for schools, theatre and dance troupes, film studios, and individual clients for theme parties, galas, Renaissance Festivals, Comic Con, and beyond. But
storing these costumes takes up most of Unit J, which is half the studio and
half the rent – a whopping $1,500 a month. While the new space and other changes to our
look and staffing has created a thriving and robust climate for our alterations
and custom work, our rentals are taking longer to pick up steam.</p>
<p>The main goal for
funding is to cover the costs of maintaining the Costume Closet for the next
year, which includes the rental fees and other overhead expenses for that part of the studio, cleaning
costs, and material costs for any repairs needed.  We have recently implemented several new
marketing tactics and slimmed down our operation as much as possible.  Now we need the time and capital to see it through.</p><p><b>Some Examples of our Costumes</b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434129489/g8lwplcqinasilticxff.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>The Impact</b></p>

</div></div>","In just few seconds you can have the color you like !!                                   
With just one bag you are
getting basically 5 different options to choose from. You always have 3 colors
with you anytime you are out.  You can flip
the addition from the other side and automatically you have different bag!!!
What's really exiting about
this bag is that you are saving a lot of space and the minimum that you can
replace is another 5 bags.  Very accessible and easy
for everyday use. 
     BenefitsOne of the main reasons why this bag is awesome is that with the price of one bag you will have ""5 different bags"" and increase your saving account. 
· 
How many times you were struggling to match your heels and
bag?

· How many times you were wondering which scarf and belt to wear with your bag?· How many times you were wishing to have just one bag to solve all of this problems?                         What is the only thing that ladies handbags are missing?
- Order!  

This handbag has pockets and space that will help you organize, put everything in place and give you fresher and tidier look inside! Two Special Shades holders on each side of the bag. No more wasting time to take your shades in and out from the bag for countless times while shopping!
                    


Addition for your color add-ons. Very simple and easy way to store your other ""4 bags"" in the locker and save plenty of room for other stuff. All you need to do is put a hanger on your addition!




                   


Now you don't have to transfer all your stuff from one bag to another just because you want to go in different style or outfit to work, or shopping. 

  
              






          
                      
 When will my M&V Handbag be shipped?

<p>The three of us have been friends and
business partners for over 12 years now. Here's a little of our background and
relevant history. For the past 15 years Mauro has been in product manufacturing
and quality control. As a result, he's manufactured a wide variety of
high-quality retail products for some of America’s biggest retailers. Steve on
the other hand, is an all-around talented designer, who's been crucial in
creating our product designs, drawings and the website. My background has been
in business management and sales. Over the past several decades, I've
successfully launched, grown, managed and sold several companies. Together, the
three of us make a great, motivated team that’s focused on creating and marketing great
products. </p>
<p>In 2015 we were issued a total of<b> 4 patents on our unique Trakline belts</b>. In
addition, we have two more patents pending that we expect to issue within the
next year. Why all the patents ? We’ve spent a lot of time and money perfecting our proprietary technology
and we'd like to keep it that way.  <br/></p>

NO MORE BELT HOLES.  Instead Trakline belts use a hidden, 10” track
sewn into the backside of the leather to create over 40+ size positions that let you adjust your belt in ¼”
increments. This means when you slide our belt around your waist - it locks at
your exact waist size creating a perfect fit every time you put it on. 

To release or
adjust the belt, just pinch the small tab under the buckle. It's like a giant zip tie for your waist - only more fun.

                                             < Customer Comments >“I love my Trakline belt!  I show it off to everyone. Great product, so glad I became a backer!” - Mike Goodridge

“This is an amazing belt ! The quality is great and is now my favourite belt!” - Thurstan Johnstan

“Got my two belts and buckles and they're amazing. The quality is top-notch.” - Casus Belli

“I love the belt and the quality in manufacturing and design is evident in everything.” - Scott Burns
“Seriously, I can't get over how much I love this belt. I totally forget I'm wearing it because it's so comfortable.” - Thomas Ella



Although we’ve been on Kickstarter and Indiegogo a combined 7 times before with great success, we’re still a small company and launching a new product requires a lot of resources and funds up front. This means we need your support to help pay for molds and enough starting inventory to keep the costs down. In return, we’d love to give you one of these fabulous new belts, or several if you like. Either way – we promise you’re going to love it. 










We plan to begin the first production run in mid March. Based on the factories estimate, this process
should take about 30-45 days to complete depending on volume. Once production is completed, we'll ship the
belts to our warehouse in San Diego, California (2-3 weeks) and then repackage
individual orders to ship out to contributors (2 weeks). So all in all, you should get your belt about 30 days after this campaign ends. 


We
launched our first Trakline men's belts back in 2013 with great. Today our
company is known as Kore Essentials and we pride ourselves in creating unique, high-quality accessories for men. If you’d like to see our entire collection of belts
and other accessories, or learn more about our company, visit us at  >>  http://www.KoreEssentials.com 

Karl Kozak:  Sales & MarketingMauro Bove:  Manufacturing & Quality ControlSteve Olson:  Product & Web Design
The three of us have been friends and
business partners for over 12 years now. Here's a little of our background and
relevant history. For the past 15 years Mauro has been in product manufacturing
and quality control. As a result, he's manufactured a wide variety of
high-quality retail products for some of America’s biggest retailers. Steve on
the other hand, is an all-around talented designer, who's been crucial in
creating our product designs, drawings and the website. My background has been
in business management and sales. Over the past several decades, I've
successfully launched, grown, managed and sold several companies. Together, the
three of us make a great, motivated team that’s focused on creating and marketing great
products. 
In 2015 we were issued a total of 4 patents on our unique Trakline belts. In
addition, we have two more patents pending that we expect to issue within the
next year. Why all the patents ? We’ve spent a lot of time and money perfecting our proprietary technology
and we'd like to keep it that way.

<p>From the storm of ideas emerges a shape - an initial freehand sketch which captures the pure lines of the AIRSPEED.  

While examining the technical specifications of the design, we asked ourselves these questions: How will the watch be powered? How will it transmit stored energy? Which materials guarantee the level of precision, reliability and quality required over the long term? Technical considerations, ergonomic details and dial design are pondered down to the tiniest detail and coordinated with one another.</p>

<p>The sketch is then given volume by 3D rendering, followed by two working prototypes. The curved case design and all other materials are thoroughly tested and improved in durability, water and air pressure resistance, as well as an overall homogeny in appearance and finish.</p>

<p>The regulator complication first appeared in the late 17th century and was used by watchmakers for verifying the rates of their creations. For those unfamiliar, a regulator is a watch in which the second, minute and hour hands are separated into sub-dials. With the AIRSPEED, a traditional vertical layout is swapped for a more asymmetric design, resulting in an unexpectedly modern take on this vintage design. </p>

<p>The curved casing is made from Hesalite crystal, a robust, shatterproof material that has gone into space on many occasions.  With Hesalite, smudges are hardly visible on the AIRSPEED. It even gives the dial a warmer look. You’ll notice that the dome-shaped crystal extends to the very edge– making the watch look more crystal than metal. This is more than an elegant design feature, as it slightly magnifies the dial elements for better legibility from all angles and lighting conditions.</p>

<p>After carefully evaluating a number of options, we sensibly picked the Miyota 8219, an absolute tank of a ticker with an impeccable reputation since its debut in 1977. Beating to a frequency of 21,600 BPH / 3 Hz, Miyota has proven to be more accurate than most mechanical watches at 18,000 BPH / 2.5 Hz. The movement has 21 jewel to reduce friction and wear on moving parts, maintain temperature stability, and the ability to operate without lubrication, well above the 17 jewel average. Miyota also employs its own shock resistance technology called Parashock, making the watch more durable and perfect for multipurpose wear. With the massive 2-day / 45-hour power reserve, you do not need to constantly wind it. You can take it off on Friday and it will still be ticking on Sunday.</p>

We have spent several months at the driving range, and on different courses, rigged-up with wires and a dozen earlier prototypes, constantly improving, and constantly learning from our experiences.</p><p>We're delighted that over 10,000 golfers now trust us to keep their stats, using the Golfication App. With your support and interest, we now endeavour to deliver a product that will significantly improve your game, and your on-course experience!</p><p> </p><h3>Risk &amp; Challenges</h3><p>After more than two years of research and development, and testing prototypes, <strong>we have now manufactured the first batch of Golfication X. </strong>They're more beautiful than we had imagined, and as powerful as we promised! Get ready for some serious Game-Improvement in 2019.</p><p>Golfication X has been reviewed by both professional and club-level golfers. <strong>Check out the Gallery section of our campaign for full reviews.</strong></p><p>We've overcome several challenges over the past two years - we've brought down the weight from 40g to 20g - nearly half the weight of an Apple Watch! All our swing parameters have been tested against High-Speed Cameras, and leading Industry Standards such as Trackman, to ensure you get high-quality data every single time.</p><p>As avid golfers, we've put our heart and soul into the development of Golfication X, to make sure you can always trust your AI friend to improve your game.</p><p> </p><h3>Frequently Asked Questions:</h3><p><strong>How many tags come with the product?</strong></p><p>The Golfication X system contains 14 tags - one for each of your Golf Clubs, including a special tag for your putter. </p><p><strong>How can I purchase additional tags?</strong></p><p>You can purchase additional tags on the Golfication Website at any time (after shipping), and add them to your set.</p><p><strong>What is the battery life of the main sensor?</strong></p><p>The main sensor is powered by a 200 mAh Lithium Ion battery that is rechargeable via a USB charger which is included in the box. The battery is designed to last for 8 hours, or two golf rounds.</p><p><strong>Will my home course be mapped when I receive the device?</strong></p><p>Yes, your home course will be mapped before you receive the device, as we will request for these details via email following the campaign. We expect to have mapped over 18,000 Golf Courses at the time of launch, including 7,500 in the United States. Additionally, as a Golfication X or a Golfication App - Pro (Premium Subscription) User, if you wish to play a course that is currently un-mapped, you must request for mapping through the Golfication App. It will be ready to play in a few days!</p><p><strong>What is the weight and size of Golfication X?</strong></p><p>The Golfication X is an ultra light-weight device, which fits perfectly on the Velcro of any standard golf glove. It weighs about 20g or 0.7 ounces, less than half the weight of an Apple Watch.</p><p><strong>Won’t the device slip or fly out during the Golf Swing?</strong></p><p>No. It’s a well-tested device, that has been subjected to high velocities and forces, commonly experienced in Golf Swings (up to 140 mph drive club-head speeds). It is designed to grip the glove which prevents it from falling out during the swing or impact.</p><p><strong>Do I need to Tap somewhere or do anything before my shots?</strong></p><p>No, it’s a Tap-free device, as we want you to enjoy golf and not just keep tapping.</p><p><strong>Do I need my Mobile Phone of Course to ensure proper functionality of the device?</strong></p><p>No, Golfication X is designed to work even without your mobile phone on the Golf Course. The wrist-mounted wearable can detect Golf Swings, capture your swing metrics, and GPS location of each of your shots, even without your phone. You can view your Round Analytics after your round, by syncing the device with your app. Unlike other devices, Golfication X does NOT use your Smartphone GPS.</p><p><strong>Can I still play with mild rain?</strong></p><p>Yes, the Golfication X system is certified IP65, which makes it resistant to rain and dust. As long as it's playable weather, Golfication X will work for you!</p><p><strong>Do I need to have a smartphone to analyze and share my game?</strong></p><p>Yes, you would need an Android / iOS smartphone or tablet to run the Golfication App, to check your stats and explore a bunch of exciting features!</p><p><strong>On which platforms can I find the Golfication App?</strong></p><p>The Golfication App is available for both Apple iPhones, and Android Devices.<br/>* <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/golfication-scorecard-stats-and-golf-social/id1216612467?mt=8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Download </a><a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/golfication-scorecard-stats-and-golf-social/id1216612467?mt=8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">on</a><a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/golfication-scorecard-stats-and-golf-social/id1216612467?mt=8"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> the App Store</a><br/>* <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.khelfiegolf&amp;hl=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Get it on Google Play</a></p><p><strong>Is Golfication App free to download?</strong></p><p>Yes, this app is free to download. You can use GPS Distances, Smart Club Recommendations and access several important stats like club distances &amp; accuracy. To access premium features - like Strokes Gained, Dispersions, AI Golf Clash &amp; Augmented Reality, you can upgrade to Pro Membership.</p><p><strong>If I am backing this Campaign, do I need to pay for the app separately?</strong></p><p>No, all backers selecting Perks for $25 or higher, get access to all premium features of the app for free.</p><p><strong>Can Golfication X be used during Tournaments?</strong></p><p>Golfication X is enabled with a Tournament Mode, which allows players to access only distances (and no other additional information that may assist) during play. We plan to approach the USGA to be officially declared as Permitted during Tournaments.</p><p><strong>Is Golfication X used by Amateurs or Professional Golfers?</strong></p><p>Golfication X is for golfers of all skill levels - from pro-golfers to 20+ handicappers.

Get ready for some serious Game-Improvement in 2019.Golfication X has been reviewed by both professional and club-level golfers. Check out the Gallery section of our campaign for full reviews.We've overcome several challenges over the past two years - we've brought down the weight from 40g to 20g - nearly half the weight of an Apple Watch! All our swing parameters have been tested against High-Speed Cameras, and leading Industry Standards such as Trackman, to ensure you get high-quality data every single time.As avid golfers, we've put our heart and soul into the development of Golfication X, to make sure you can always trust your AI friend to improve your game. Frequently Asked Questions:How many tags come with the product?The Golfication X system contains 14 tags - one for each of your Golf Clubs, including a special tag for your putter. How can I purchase additional tags?You can purchase additional tags on the Golfication Website at any time (after shipping), and add them to your set.What is the battery life of the main sensor?The main sensor is powered by a 200 mAh Lithium Ion battery that is rechargeable via a USB charger which is included in the box. The battery is designed to last for 8 hours, or two golf rounds.Will my home course be mapped when I receive the device?Yes, your home course will be mapped before you receive the device, as we will request for these details via email following the campaign.

The wrist-mounted wearable can detect Golf Swings, capture your swing metrics, and GPS location of each of your shots, even without your phone. You can view your Round Analytics after your round, by syncing the device with your app. Unlike other devices, Golfication X does NOT use your Smartphone GPS.Can I still play with mild rain?Yes, the Golfication X system is certified IP65, which makes it resistant to rain and dust. As long as it's playable weather, Golfication X will work for you!Do I need to have a smartphone to analyze and share my game?Yes, you would need an Android / iOS smartphone or tablet to run the Golfication App, to check your stats and explore a bunch of exciting features!On which platforms can I find the Golfication App?The Golfication App is available for both Apple iPhones, and Android Devices.* Download on the App Store* Get it on Google PlayIs Golfication App free to download?Yes, this app is free to download.

Each person benefits differently from Golfication X: high-handicappers & beginners use it to improve their tempo, more advanced golfers benefit from intelligent swing analysis which integrates every swing with the shot outcome, and professionals can use Golfication X as an important tool to improve their short game (track half-swing, 3/4- swing etc).Is there a special putting sensor to detect putts?One out of the fourteen sensors in the box is a special putting sensor.

<h3>Hackpack: The 4-In-1 Commuter Bag</h3>

<h3>The Challenge</h3>
<p>It is important to look professional in the workplace. Briefcases and laptop bags provide the necessary aesthetic for looking good in the office but are impractical once you leave.

<p>The briefcase stands up on its own without flopping over like most soft briefcases. It fits perfectly under airplane seats giving you a worry-free commute.</p>
<p>Hidden briefcase handles on Hackpack streamline the design when they are not in use.</p>

<h3>Extra Goodies </h3>
<p>Organization and hidden features that make Hackpack unique and the best work bag you'll ever own. </p>
<p><strong>Expander Zipper - </strong>The Hackpack has a 360-degree expansion zipper that allows you to double the amount of storage space. This core feature lets you travel and carry everything you need without overloading your bag. You'll never have to cram items into your bag again. </p>
<p><strong>Laptop storage</strong> - Hackpack can fit multiple laptops and iPads within one bag. It can fit a laptop up to 15 inches in the dedicated laptop compartment. The microsuede interior fabric is gentle enough to keep your items protected from scratches but durable for easy cleaning and can take a beating. We've tried! </p>
<p><strong>Laptop Fastener </strong>- The laptop compartment is secured with a magnetic flap that allows for easy grab-and-go but keeps items safely secured. You can take out your laptop with one only hand. No more fighting with your bag. </p>
<p><strong>Hidden Keychain Clip </strong>- A concealed keychain clip is located on the front zipper of Hackpack. Never lose your keys again keeping them right at your fingertips, without the possibility of them falling out and getting buried at the bottom of the bag. </p>
<p><strong>Cargo net</strong> - The interior compartment of Hackpack contains a cargo net that reduces bulk by compressing your items and keeping them secure. This is an ideal location for running shoes or an extra change of clothing. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485142352/yoqih0l3mlvxzsyewbap.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>180 degree fold out - </strong>The laptop portion of Hackpack folds out flat to allow for easy packing. You can easily zip up clothing or papers for wrinkle-free storage. </p>
<p><strong>Hardware </strong>- Sturdy metal hardware in Bronze-finish keeps Hackpack reliable and durable time and time again with YKK Zippers. </p>

<p>We put Hackpack through several load tests to make sure Hackpack can stand up to anything. Here's what we did:</p>

<p>Jerk Test Bags with handles often need to withstand a sudden force. For example, if you go to lift a bag quickly, you want to be sure that pulling on the handles suddenly won’t rip the bag. <br/>Testing: We loaded Hackpack with 25 lb weights and dropped it from 1 meter high off a bar testing the backpack straps. <br/>Results: Pass - no signs of damage!</p>

<p>Fatigue Test Just as a bag’s handles are important for carrying a bag, other parts are intended to keep the contents of the bag inside during transport. Tests for bags and suitcases should also include fatigue testing designed to check the durability of the bag’s fasteners.<br/>Testing: We have carried Hackpack non-stop for several months stuffing it with as many things as possible. <br/>Results: Pass - no signs of damage!</p>

<p>Drop Test Some tests for bags and suitcases are meant to simulate rough handling experienced during travel. Luggage, in particular, is often roughly tossed around as it’s loaded and unloaded at airports and hotels. <br/>Testing: We filled Hackpack is 56 lbs and dropped it from one meter high on all 6 sides. (Yes people were staring at us like we were crazy).<br/>Results: Pass - no signs of damage</p>

<p>Load Testing A bag’s ability to withstand a certain weight without falling apart is essential. The load test is performed on bags with handles. <br/>Testing: We loaded Hackpack with 20 lbs and let is hang for 4 hours.<br/>Results: Pass - no signs of damage! </p>
<p>Hackpack stood up to all 4 of these tests and still looks great. The only thing that was worn out was us after all the heavy weight lifting. (Seriously...)</p>

People are Talking About Hackpack!

The Challenge
It is important to look professional in the workplace. Briefcases and laptop bags provide the necessary aesthetic for looking good in the office but are impractical once you leave. They lack storage, can be uncomfortable to travel with, and are clumsy when speed and efficiency are needed. Backpacks and slings are comfortable options for carrying everything needed for a day however, they lack formality for workplace settings and can make you feel out of place. 

The Solution
Hackpack is the best of both worlds. The messenger and briefcase looks are right at home in the office. When you are on the go and need your hands-free, the backpack and sling configurations allow you to keep your items comfortably close and secure.

</h3></div>","Abstract:

That is our concept:We are aiming for the development of an application which enables the usage of virtual management, categorization and the arrangement of the wardrobe. The user receives, after adding his clothes into the system, individual tips for a fitting attire, recommendations for a buy and include many more functions as the outfit calendar or the social functions which makes it possible to reveal your outfits and share & discuss it with friends on social networks.The User has the possibility to integrate his own body into the application as an avatar. Therefore a multi-stage picture capturing, can create a detailed avatar with a deviance of just 1,5 % of the body measurements. This avatar can be dressed virtually.This App serves as a driving force in meeting the demands and being an innovative advertising platform for the textile industry. The user of the application gets their individual advices for shopping which is fits best to the individualized wardrobe, moreover it offers the user the place where he can buy his favorite labels for a discount. That leads to an Win-Win situation for the User and the advertising company.





Who we are:Annika, Fritz & Philipp studying Media Management at the Ostfalia University of applied sciences. Some excellent, wine in a sociable atmosphere of creative people, was enough to born this idea. Afterwards the project were born, pointed out and formed more concretely, that we presented the idea to our professor and a decent circle of students. They were inspired and delighted by the project. That incredible feedback leads to the point, that we start the work and writing on the business plan. Today –almost 9month later- we are writing our Bachelor Thesis about financing Web 2.0 Start-Ups and models of return and usability of Web 2.0 based applications.

 

What do we need & what do you get:What do we need?The first goal is to compute a dummy, to show and convince investors by the most important functions and layouts. For that we need a programmer who can compute the elementary Java-functions. We calculated a needed budget of 10,000€ (10-15 daily rates for a professional coder). The layout can be mostly done by the founders, but for the finalization of the mock-ups a professional graphic-designer is needed. Furthermore a usability test is necessary which also can be made by the entrepreneurs, though there will be occur expenses  like travelling costs and allowances for  test persons.If the funding goal cannot be reached, you will get your investment back.What do you get?First of all we can offer you a really cool app, which enrich your weekday and satisfy your needs of managing your outfit’s digital, fitting room and mobile shopping. What you receive for your funding depends on the amount of donation. There are several options you can choose; of course you have the possibility to be one of the first users who can use the beta-phase of the application. As supporter you can take part as an ambassador for the social media campaign. Moreover you will provide with rewards e.g. coupons for a shopping day in berlin or online shopping.Impact:The user of the application gain a quick overview of their wardrobe, through the usage of the app the awareness for fashion and the innovative behavior of buying clothes will be shaped. That is the reason why user can buy things with a wider awareness and get an assistant which helps to get the clothes which fits best to the taste of the user. That effects that the user save money, because they do not spend money for clothes that they already have or which don´t fit. Moreover the app indicates clothes which has not been wearing since a longer time and remember the user. With just a few clicks/wipes you can donate clothes of your wardrobe, to your friends or list them on platforms like eBay.But you should not forget: Fashion is fun and this app underlines it!Additionally this app combines the “to be social” and leads to a paradigm in enjoying fashion and shopping.There are many ways to help us:You think our project is pretty cool, but you have insufficient resources? No problem. Of course you can support us with our project to reinvent the customer needs.Share the crowd funding announcement with friends and acquaintances where you think they may can help us.You know programmer, developer, web designer (students are welcome) or you consider yourself as one of them?

handcrafted, manufactured for durability and everyday wear. We suggest that to
maintain your Desiar frames, you keep them in a safe place. We recommend that
you do not put them in your pockets, backpack, purse, etc. If you are not
wearing them, place them in the hard case shipped with the sunglasses and/or
the microfiber cloth in a safe place out of the sun and water.

<h3>Dave's Story</h3>
<p>Like generations of men before me, I succumbed to the mass market images of men standing in front of a cold, messy sink, spreading chemicals over their faces enduring mediocre results. Nicks, cuts and razor burn became a tolerated part of my morning ritual.</p>
<p>One day I asked my dermatologist: Before the shower or after? He told me that, actually, dermatologists recommend you hydrate your skin as much as possible before, after and during shaving. They recommend you shave IN the shower. I tried it and became hooked. The warm, steamy environment opens pores, softens hair and relaxes your skin. You don’t have to be a scientist to realize you get a closer, more comfortable shave. But what to use? </p>
<p>There have been no significant improvements in shaving creams since Edge Gel was introduced . . . almost 40 years ago! Have you read the ingredients? I have sensitive skin, but a tough beard. I wanted pure, healthy, natural ingredients. I wanted a mirror. I wanted travel-friendly.  Most of all, I wanted a comfortable shave.</p>
<p>So I assembled a team of talented people, from chemists to designers. The goal was to design a product with ingredients that WE would love to use every day. Starting from scratch, we researched organic, natural oils that are proven to lubricate and nourish your skin. We chose Olive, Palm, Coconut and Jojoba oils. Shea butter is added along with essential oils like Tea Tree, Spruce, Mandarin, Bergamot Sage and Rosemary. Kaolin clay provides a gentle lather and the ""slip"" for comfort and closeness. We blend the ingredients by hand using a slow, cold process. <br/><br/>Once molded and cured, these special bars are conveniently packaged for use in the shower. An unbreakable plastic case protects the bar and makes application easy. It contains a fog-resistant, shatter-proof mirror which is easily maintained with the swipe of a soapy finger. A suction cup keeps it on the wall. Because it’s a solid bar, it will last for two months or more and is perfect for traveling. <br/><br/> Welcome to the revolution in men’s shaving. You'll love shaving with Dave's. Once you shave in the shower with Dave's, you will never shave at a cold sink again. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Currently, each of our bars is made by hand in small batches, aged for 30 days or more in a climate-controlled environment then hand-assembled. We want to maintain the hand-made quality. We need more molds so we can increase the size of the batches we make.</p>
<p>We use high quality silicone molds so the bars will release easily. Silicone molds are durable and long lasting. but they're expensive and we need a lot of them. With your help, we can increase production and continue hand-crafting our bars. We will purchase as many mold as we can with the money raised. </p>

<p>Dave's Shower Shave is also planet friendly.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Lauren Perdue and I'm a fashion design major at UNT in Denton, TX. I have an opportunity to present a full collection at my first solo runway show at Austin Fashion Week, August 10-18 2012.</p>
<p>I've been sewing since 2006 and am working my way through design school. One more year, and I'll have my BFA in design and a one-way ticket to New York City! My grades are solid and last Fall I won the Terry Costa Catwalk Competition. This Spring I had designs featured at FGI Dallas Career Day and UNT Artwear. I've participated in several fashion shows in varying capacities but this is my first solo show, and it's a full collection, 15-20 looks. I feel like the past 6 years have been building to this opportunity, and if I can pull this off it'll blow doors wide open for my next move!</p>
<p>I have to do something extraordinary to get people's attention- to set me apart for when I'm job hunting next year. I have the opportunity to put myself out there and show my point of view and my hard-won skills. I have lots of planning and resources already poured into this, but to fully realize the potential of my collection and this show, I need some help. The money raised will go toward luxury fabrics, honorariums for my makeup/hair/dj, etc, travel expenses, emergency needs and sewing help. Every donation of any size will receive a handwritten thank-you note.</p>
<p>If this fashion show goes well and receives good press and positive feedback, it's not just good for me- it's good for everyone helping me with show production, for the models who walk for me, for the business that serves as my venue, for Austin Fashion Week as a whole, for UT and UNT (my alma maters). It affects dozens of people, and it starts with you. A donation to this cause promotes beauty and happiness in the world.This is my chance to set my future in motion toward something great, and I hope that you will participate.</p>

Each of our combs are paired with a tree planted in the name of one of our backers – like you – growing tall for decades to come, making the world a happier, healthier place. Switching to sustainably sourced wood combs is easy and you'll never lose a plastic pocket-comb again. Bamboo and Sandalwood is 100% natural and 100% biodegradable, which means your comb will break down naturally wherever you lose it. Our rounded mid-toothed pocket combs are great at detangling hair of all types – not just beard hair. You're going to love your new pocket comb regardless if you're bearded or beardless. Thank you for planting trees with us!  We are Ready to Go!Our combs are currently in production and our reforestation partners are on-the-ground planting trees right now. All we need is your beard's support to make this dream a reality.  Trees are more than just a good fit for a beard company. Trees clean our air and water, create habitats for biodiversity, contribute to our health and wellbeing, and create jobs for social impact all around the globe.We care deeply about the planet and creating a business that gives back to the great outdoors and the wild places in this world – that’s why we've partnered with One Tree Planted to plant one tree for every Naturally Normal Pocket Comb (3-pack) and two trees for every Tree-mendous Sandalwood Folding Comb awarded through our campaign and beyond. The reforestation projects your pledges support do more than just plant trees – they support communities, increase biodiversity, provide clean air, filter water, help cool the planet, and generally make the world a happier greener place.  Together Green Beard Grooming and One Tree Planted are on a beardly mission to reforest the planet, one beard at a time! Currently, your trees are destined for Australia, in the future, Green Beard Grooming's efforts will shift to other regions of the world and right here at home, in North America. Our combs are a sustainable alternative to the cheap, plastic combs you can find anywhere, and the overpriced wood combs sold by other beard brands. They are of the highest quality, and perfectly sized for pockets, but not physically all that unique. What makes our combs truly different is that each comb is paired with a newly planted tree growing strong in a forest.This comb was designed to be a sustainable alternative to the standard 3-pack of cheap disposable plastic combs – but instead of plastic in a landfill every 3-pack of our combs represents a freshly planted tree.  The Naturally Normal Pocket Comb is a mid-toothed pocket comb with rounded teeth that are great at detangling hair of all hair types – not just beard hair – and is healthier for your scalp than scratchy plastic combs.  Bamboo combs are naturally antistatic and good conduits for beard oils, waxes, and balms. What we really love about bamboo, though, is that it’s a naturally renewable resource. After being harvested, fresh shoots spring up from the roots without needing to be replanted. Bamboo is remarkably low impact.Naturally Normal Pocket Comb Unboxing
 Compost Note: Our Naturally Normal Pocket Combs are designed to breakdown. They are very durable if kept dry but return to nature quickly in humid environments. They hold up great in a pocket or on a shelf – not so well in composter or shower.  This fragrant mid-toothed sandalwood comb has a weighted-feel and a super smooth finish that glides effortlessly through all hair types - not just beard hair. Each aptly named, Tree-mendous Folding Comb funds the planting of two trees and is made from sustainably harvested sandalwood – certified by the Forest Stewardship Council.Our sandalwood folding combs are even more durable and long-lasting than our bamboo combs thanks to sandalwood’s dense character and the comb’s design. The combing head of the Tree-mendous Folding Comb tucks nicely into an unfinished protective pocket, with the added bonus of keeping your comb smelling of fresh sandalwood oil. Sandalwood oil promotes healthy hair growth and is valued for its long lasting scent.Sustainability Concerns of Sandalwood Note: Sandalwood is the heavy scented heartwood of several species of genus Santalum. Some sandalwoods are sustainably harvested while other species are on the brink of extinction. Our manufacturers only source materials certified by the Forest Stewardship Council.Tree-Mendous Folding Comb Unboxing Composting Note: The tree-mendous folding comb has a metal hinge that can be easily removed and recycled, the comb was just too lossey-goosey without it. Check with your composting facility to make sure they accept wood products before composting.  Why choose sandalwood or bamboo when you can have both in one Tree-mendous Combo Pack. You get three regret-free bamboo pocket combs that you won't feel bad about losing and one very impressive sandalwood folding comb that will last for years. We’ll also plant three trees in your name.  The world doesn't need another ""revolutionary"" comb designed with a bottle opener in the handle – left to his own devices that is exactly what our founder would create – but it's unnecessary. Sustainably sourced products and reforestation efforts, though? Those are absolutely necessary!Our goal is to make sustainably sourced combs available to people who are currently using disposable plastic combs and to help grow a greener world in the process. No part of our mission mandates cutting-edge comb designs. We won’t settle for an inferior product, we simply don’t believe the pocket comb needs to be reinvented. Green Beard Grooming's mustachioed creator has lost a lot of pocket combs over the years – no clue where they went.

We are the BEHRENS ORIGINAL - a watch company that is based in Hong Kong. We specialized in watchmaking and watch modification, in which we take pride in what we do. Our founder, B.Q.Jack, has more than 15 years in watchmaking - which we genuinely called him a watch factory master.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1546500913/gjai6zeva79xceaqhvfc.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>HOW DID WE COME ALIVE?</strong></p><p>We pledged to inherit Peter Behrens’ (14 April 1868 - 27 February 1940) design philosophy on watchmaking. He was a German architect and designer; and also one of the important figures to the modernist movement.</p><p><i>“...to continue innovating is always been our life goal. All watches are fixed in form and have the design of all looking alike.

<p>My name is Kelvin Dijkhuizen, project leader and founder of Valuchi Watches. I am a<strong> millennial entrepreneur</strong> who is always seeking for new adventures and ideas. I wanted to create a watch product, one which is good-looking, well-built and doesn't break the bank. In the core of this search I tried to find a way to create impeccable value at a down-to-earth price point. Value that makes his or her life just a little better. </p>
<p>I've been <strong>obsessed with watches</strong> for as long as I can remember – likely my entire life – and because of my continuing passion for horology, I created Valuchi. I combined my great passion for watches with the love for my home city Amsterdam, as well as the city of Milan, where this whole idea of creating a watch brand began.</p>
<p>Luckily I got accompanied in this journey by a small diverse team with creative millennials who just like me, go asleep and wake up with <strong>Valuchi in mind</strong>. This all to make a watch brand which will give an extra value to all lives wearing a Valuchi watch on their wrist.</p>

<p><strong>CUSTOMS &amp; DUTIES INFORMATION</strong></p>
<p>DOMESTIC SHIPPING - To 7 Countries:</p>
<p>United States, Philippines, Hong Kong, Singapore, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Russia. We have a warehouse in Hong Kong that allow us to offer low-cost domestic shipping to the 7 countries listed above. Backers with a shipping address in any of these 7 countries will NOT have to pay any additional duties, sales tax, VAT, etc.</p>
<p>INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING - All over the World:</p>
<p>Backers from all countries may have to pay additional import duties or other applicable taxes to the concerned authorities upon receipt of their goods - depending on the import policies of their respective countries. The duties and tax rates vary from country to country. If you wish to learn about the duties and taxes applicable to your shipment, you may want to check with the customs and border protection authority of your country.</p>
<p>SHIPPING POLICY</p>
<p>If our shipping carrier attempts delivery to you and the package returns to our warehouse (either because you’re not there, the wrong address was provided, or you moved without telling us), it will be the buyer's responsibility to pay the shipping fee to reship the order. When you receive your tracking number, please keep an eye out for the package.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p><strong>The challenges to Valuchi watches will now be</strong> getting the word out, and convincing people on Indiegogo to participate. With so many great projects to choose from, we hope ours will stand apart from the rest. To reach as many people as possible, we are asking friends, families, and various blogs to help spread the word. Once the funding is in place, the challenge will be producing on a large scale. Depending on outside help is difficult, but we have been dealing with a manufacturer for years and have established a solid relationship, which has given us a lot of confidence in them.</p>

</div></div>","Plenty of designs and countless samples later, we came up with the Perpetual Calendar series, a watch series that’s guaranteed to turn heads wherever you go. 
Each Valuchi watch has been meticulously designed to ensure its simple perfection. We have multiple different color schemes, and we’re confident you'll find your favorite. 

Every watch is finished with an exceptional color scheme, and they accompany the most active lifestyles with incomparable class.We wanted to make a watch, one which is good-looking, well-built and doesn't break the bank.That's exactly what we did!

In August of 2018 I sat in a staircase at the Piazza di Milano (the square). Looking at the Duomo, suddenly an idea crossed my mind:Wouldn't it be a great to turn my great passion for watches into actual watches?
...that's where the journey began. 
Duomo di Milano, Milan
We combined the old traditional styles of our home city Amsterdam and Milan to make a watch collection which is new and fresh but classical and traditional at the same time. 
Westerkerk, Amsterdam
On the back of your watch you will find a unique engraving that encapsulates the inspirational design of our journey. 
       
One the left you will find the Westerkerk, Amsterdam and on the right you will find the Duomo di Milano, Milan. These iconic landmarks are truly mesmerizing. They will leave you speechless at their unarguable beauty. 


Valuchi has partnered with the finest watch manufacturers. Craftsmanship is key, and each watchmaker put considerable time, effort, and attention to detail toward creating our timepieces.  

Every watch is assembled using advanced technologies, artisanal know-how, authenticity, and exemplary finishing. We developed multiple watch prototypes to perfect our end product— resulting in the very best watch Valuchi can offer.  

We use only the finest premium, luxury Italian leather for a sumptuous, tactile experience. We coordinate the rich leather strap to either match or contrast perfectly with your watch - creating the élan (energy and style) of a thousand-dollar-timepiece. 


Italian leather is well known in the fashion industry as the very best. One of the reasons Italian leather is so highly regarded is because of its quality. Our limited travel cases will also come in this beautiful leather.

The problem we were facing was finding a watch with a luxurious feeling for an affordable price. 
                     We have been cutting out all the hidden fees you normally pay. Think of branding cost, distributors, retail stores and wholesalers. We tried to make a watch brand without having the audacity to charge $2000+ for a watch.
With the rounded shape of its bezel, the ingenious porthole construction of its case, and its beautiful dial, the Perpetual Calendar has the elegance you only dreamt off. In multiple colors we made a splendid collection of models in steel, rose gold and black. 


Beyond the round bezel with eight screws, the dial features a moon phase with a lightning bolt seconds hand which makes it a real eye-catcher. 


 







This audacious choice of the green color in combination with rose gold evokes a sense of adventure and far horizons. The rounded bezel with eight screws combines polished and satin finishes. 
 








Our bracelets are designed to be customizable with removable links, so that they can comfortably fit on wrists of all sizes. 


Balanced, elegant and refined, the Perpetual Calendar comes with a full range of calendar functions in addition to its brilliant moonphase complication. 





The packaging that comes with a watch might actually make a bigger difference than one might think. Opening a package isn’t only about what’s inside; it’s about the entire experience. 
We designed Valuchi's packaging with a beautiful Leondardo da Vinci quote in mind. ""Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"".
​Because this is the start of your Valuchi watch collection, we want to give you the best watch experience as possible. With that goal in mind we proudly introduce the Limited Italian Leather Travel Case. 

The case is sturdily built, made of handcrafted, genuine Italian leather with precise stitching that elevates its aesthetic.The retail price of these limited travel cases are $110, but because our appreciation to you when backing 2 or more watches, we give it for FREE!
 



 




 

The detailed manual work carried out on the components of a watch is where hand-finishing reaches a rare pinnacle. 

Like a butterfly spreading its wings, Valuchi’s choice of a butterfly clasp is made of two metal hinges that open symmetrically outward to the right and left.
The butterfly clasp is attached to the watch with a spring bar and enhances the overall appearance of a watch while making it easier to open and close than a regular watch clasp.

The Miyota movements perform at the same accuracy as entry level Swiss movements and considered to be real powerhouses. These movements have proven their consistent accuracy over the decades and are easy to service. (battery life of 3 years)
 








We are so confident about the quality of our watches, that every watch we produce comes with a 2 year warranty. Warranty includes all internal parts of the watch.
Warranty does not cover: 

The life of the battery 
Wear and tear and aging (e.g. scratched crystal; alteration of the color and/or material of non metallic straps and chains, such as leather, textile, rubber; peeling of the plating) 
Any damage on any part of the watch resulting from abnormal/abusive use, lack of care, negligence, accidents (knocks dents, crushing, broken crystal, etc.) 


My name is Kelvin Dijkhuizen, project leader and founder of Valuchi Watches. I am a millennial entrepreneur who is always seeking for new adventures and ideas. I wanted to create a watch product, one which is good-looking, well-built and doesn't break the bank. In the core of this search I tried to find a way to create impeccable value at a down-to-earth price point. Value that makes his or her life just a little better. 
I've been obsessed with watches for as long as I can remember – likely my entire life – and because of my continuing passion for horology, I created Valuchi. I combined my great passion for watches with the love for my home city Amsterdam, as well as the city of Milan, where this whole idea of creating a watch brand began.
Luckily I got accompanied in this journey by a small diverse team with creative millennials who just like me, go asleep and wake up with Valuchi in mind. This all to make a watch brand which will give an extra value to all lives wearing a Valuchi watch on their wrist.
 

In order to turn this dream of ours into a reality, we need your support. Not only does this mean pledging for one of our excellent timepieces, but also sharing our story with a friend. The important thing to remember with Indiegogo is, if we don't reach our fixed funding goal, these watches will not become reality. 
We are going to do everything we can to spread the word in a variety of ways. We hope through the use of social media and blogs we can drive enough outside traffic to our page which will result in us reaching our funding goal. If you could do something as simple as tweeting about our page, or just following our Instagram page, it can really go a long way. Simply click the Instagram and Facebook tabs at the bottom of the page. 
Our sincere thanks to everyone who helped us to create this brand and who gave us honest feedback throughout the last two years!

If you wish to learn about the duties and taxes applicable to your shipment, you may want to check with the customs and border protection authority of your country.
SHIPPING POLICY
If our shipping carrier attempts delivery to you and the package returns to our warehouse (either because you’re not there, the wrong address was provided, or you moved without telling us), it will be the buyer's responsibility to pay the shipping fee to reship the order. When you receive your tracking number, please keep an eye out for the package. 
Risks and challenges
The challenges to Valuchi watches will now be getting the word out, and convincing people on Indiegogo to participate. With so many great projects to choose from, we hope ours will stand apart from the rest. To reach as many people as possible, we are asking friends, families, and various blogs to help spread the word. Once the funding is in place, the challenge will be producing on a large scale. Depending on outside help is difficult, but we have been dealing with a manufacturer for years and have established a solid relationship, which has given us a lot of confidence in them.

Some of the most potent of these particles is called PM2.5 meaning that these particles are 2.5 microns.To put this into perspective, a micron is a millionth of a metre, with a human hair being around 70 microns.  Our filter range embeds botanicals sourced from Australian farms which offer subtle flora scents and other botanical benefits. Each filter harnesses the naturally evolved properties of the embedded botanical. Based on a body of scientific literature, choose the O2Plus filter which suits your needs. And for those of you who just want to breathe in pure air, we have a blank filter for you too.  Our botanical filters are the same as the standard filters, blocking over 99% of PM0.1, but with added botanical benefits.Our ultra breathable skins are made from machine washable polyurethane foam, soft on the skin with high durability. Coming in a range of simple block colours designed to complement any outfit. From the urban commuter through to the corporate professional, dress it up with a blazer or rock it with your favourite pair of jeans.For maximum efficiency and hygiene, filters last up to 100 hours or between 2-4 weeks depending on use. The filters are interchangeable with your washable mask skin, so you can choose the filter you want when you want. With multiple sizes and colours, we offer protection for the whole family. Sizes include Kids/XS, S/M and Large. You can select your size during the backer survey which is sent to your email 11 days after your pledge. The size guide is available on our website here. Choose your size, colour and filter type after supporting our project. On the 11th day after you have made your contribution, you will automatically receive an email with a survey link to provide this information. Please note, we do not offer refunds on contributions made once this 11 day period has passed. Indiegogo takes a non-refundable platform fee after this stage. We also use your contribution to pay for production, alongside campaign running costs.",49.0,0,"1 Campaign

prepared to service this campaigns demand!  We will be pulling the trigger on manufacturing immediately after we hit the $8,500 mark (hoping this happens) and will continue to manufacture parts while the campaign is actually running.  This will allow us to hit our delivery date of mid summer!  All the laces and hardware you see in this campaign are production parts.  There are no hurdles to jump with production, the hard work is done and we are ready to go!</p><div data-id=""20825529""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy""

Can I run with the Xpand Quick Release System?</b> Absolutely. This system is designed with runners and hard core athletes in mind. You can set the tension as tight as you would like. You will also be surprised how much comfort the system provides with the little extra ""give"" the elastic laces provide.</p><p><b>3. Are the laces adjustable after I trim them?</b> Absolutely, just make sure that you don't trim them too short initially. We suggest test fitting prior to trimming the laces. Install the lock and get the shoe set for the relaxed fit first.  Remember, you can always trim more if needed. </p><p><b>4. Do they work on kids shoes?</b> They work excellently with kids shoes!

Casual, athletic, sport, boots, high tops, it really doesn't matter, we have you covered! Keep on scrolling our page for tons of information on the new lacing system.SLIP ON AND GO IN RELAXED MODE! If you're not doing any vigorous activities and you want the most comfortable fit in the world, simply slip your shoes on and go! No need to lock! The key is to set the tension you desire for a ultra relaxed fit during the installation process. It's very simple and all of our backers will get a complimentary full installation instructional video.QUICKLY LOCK OR UNLOCK. Get comfortable or get serious in 3 seconds flat. Lock in place, or pop the lock and release. It's that simple.LOCK FOR ACTIVE MODE. Quickly tighten and lock your desired tension/fit in place. As easy as it is to lock in place, it's nearly impossible for our system to come unlocked or loosen during activities. Our minimal design is extremely simple and effective with almost any pair of shoes! Notice how nice and flat our laces sit against the shoes due to the design of our lock?UNLOCK FOR RELAXED MODE. It's always nice to release pressure. Simply pull the tab and pop the lock, it's that simple. The secret is within the design. The grooves lined within the canals that your laces rest in actually pull the laces downward and become tighter as pressure is applied. The laces become thinner as you pull the tab outward allowing them to free from the grooves.REVERSE/HIDDEN MODE FOR ANY PANTS.Simply twist the lock so it's facing in the opposite direction, pull the tab upwards and lock in place. This method can be used in any situation but it works great with pants because the clips rest upwards and tuck nicely under your pant legs hidden from view!SOME SERIOUS STRETCH COMFORT.Our inner lace is made with strands of high grade German rubber to give a little extra flex in each step or stride.  Unlike standard laces that have virtually no flex, our laces act as a small shock absorber.  This provides relief along the top of your feet and translates all the way to the bottom of your feet.5 SECOND INSTALLATION CLIP.Installing the Xpand Quick Release System is literally a ""SNAP"".  It takes all of about 5 minutes to do a full installation on a pair of shoes.  The clip below is a quick demo of how simple it actually is!

NOT JUST SHOES.While developing this product we realized how many products such as backpacks, shorts, pants, jackets, camping equipment, camera bags etc. that require those pinch and slide toggles that always loosen up. The Xpand Quick Release System is a game changer! Not only do you get extreme holding power, you get a clean look in comparison to other toggles that force the cord to hang straight out.SIMPLICITY AT ITS BEST.I wanted the new Xpand Quick Release System to be extremely simple to install and even easier to use.  Our 1 piece design is extremely effective and sets us apart from others.  Made from a fiber filled resin, it's nearly indestructible and holds up to some serious abuse! 
GUARANTEED NOT TO SLIP.  Trial and error along with 8 solid months of in-use hardcore testing on a wide spectrum of shoes and boots! I certainly didn't rush this product to market. I wanted to make sure it would withstand heavy usage and take a beating! It really doesn't matter if your running a triathlon or walking the park, Xpand is up for the task. Our Lock design held over 30 Pounds (16.5kg) of pressure before any slippage occurred. This was 4x the holding power of any other clip designs we tested! It's true. The new Xpand Quick Release System is for any and everyone! It doesn't matter if you're a couch potato or a world class triathlete. This system will become your shoes best friend. One thing you will notice immediately is the level of comfort established with the semi-forgiving elastic laces. Do the things you love ""comfortably"" with the Xpand System. Don't forget about your kiddos, they will love them too!                              MIX AND MATCH FROM OVER 40 COLORS.With over 40 potential colors (keep scrolling down to see them) to choose from, we're sure you can find something that matches your shoes! You will get to pick your colors after the campaign ends. All the colors are listed below. If you're interested in our flat lacing system, make sure to check out the ""combo pack""!                            COLOR, COLOR AND MORE COLOR.We know how import color is.  Color can make or break things aesthetically.  We matched pantone colors to the best of our ability to match today's hottest and most popular shoes.  We're sure you can find some colors that will work great with your shoes! Our reflective series laces will be unlocked if we raise $100k or more. These will be offered when picking your colors prior to delivery and will cost an extra buck.                                 THE XPAND FLAT LACING SYSTEM.I launched the Original Flat Xpand Lacing System into the Crowdfunding world in October of 2015 on Kickstarter and then on Indiegogo.  Our Campaign was a huge success with nearly 40,000 backers and over $1,200,000 total funds raised.  We delivered successfully and many people are still enjoying the same set of laces today that were purchased over 2 years ago!  While the new Quick Release System is not here to replace the original flat system, we wanted to make sure and offer a round system with a few different characteristics and performance enhancements.  The Xpand Original Flat Lacing System transforms almost any shoe or boot into a comfortable, hassle free slip-on.  Set the desired tension for a perfect fit day after day!HALF & HALF COMBO PACKSince our Flat Lacing System continues to be very popular, we figured you may want to try some of each!  Pick any colors after the campaign ends!DESIGN TEAM PARTNERS.I continued to work with the same design team that I have worked with since I started to develop and launch products.  The Pillar Product Design Team is second to none and they always give my product ideas/concepts the attention and details needed to become a reality.  It's always a pleasure working them.  As simple as this product looks, there were many factors that came into play during the development process. While testing the pull-tabs, we found that simple was always better.  With so many variations that accomplished the same thing, we found the one that did the job best.  Through the pull tab testing phase, we tested over 20 designs!The strength testing box was essential in developing our lock.  While ease of use was on our mind, the lock had to out-perform the other locking devices on the market.  What we didn't realize was how much more pressure our design was going to hold!  If you're looking for performance, we found it!  As simple as the product looks, the tooling/mould to actually create the product was a little more complex than the standard.  The way the teeth are designed and some of the radius' required caused a few issues but in the end, we conquered!  Can't wait to get this in your hands! MANUFACTURING PARTNERS.I have worked with both our plastic parts manufacturer and our shoelace manufacturer for over 4 years now.  They have never let me down and continue to produce quality parts in a timely manner.  To date we have ran MILLIONS of parts with both of them.  They are prepared to service this campaigns demand!  We will be pulling the trigger on manufacturing immediately after we hit the $8,500 mark (hoping this happens) and will continue to manufacture parts while the campaign is actually running.  This will allow us to hit our delivery date of mid summer!  All the laces and hardware you see in this campaign are production parts.  There are no hurdles to jump with production, the hard work is done and we are ready to go!Each cavity has a number to help keep track of parts.  While each cavity is basically identical, the reality is each part can vary slightly.  By having a number on each cavity/part, we were able to test each part individually to make sure the performance was perfect!These tools/moulds will be serviced about every 300,000 cycles.  This means we will manufacture approximately 1.2 million locks before the tool will show any signs of wear and require some service.  If this campaign goes well, we will immediately have additional tools/moulds manufactured as backups and to speed up the production process.As you can see above, the locks come connected in groups of 4.  They are then placed in a tumbler that separates the locks from the waste.  The waste is actually recycled and used to make other parts that do not require as much strength as our locks.  We do not re-use the waste because once the plastic is re-heated/melted, it loses some strength.  Don't worry, one of the manufacturers other customers will make sure it's used. The pull tabs are made of similar material as our locks but they do not contain any fibers.  The fibers are what gives the locks their rigidness.  The pull tabs need to be able to fold over and snap in place at the ends of your lace so they definitely can't be rigid due to the one piece design.While our laces look like a standard round style shoelace on the outside, it's all about what's on the inside that makes a difference. 20 individual strands of German made natural rubber provides longevity and holds zero memory.

<h3>The Six Degree Project</h3>
<p>The Six Degree Project is a grassroots initiative, developed by passionate students in Toronto dedicating to creating social change. The project is spearheaded collaboratively by autistic Northern student and autism advocate Carly Fleischmann, and students Emily Albert and Mia Kibel. We feel that though autism is growing more and more prevalent, it is highly misunderstood. Our aim is to foster acceptance and understanding.</p>
<p>The objective is to get celebrities who are constantly in the media eye to participate by wearing an Autism-blue scarf! </p>
<p>We are committed to improving the lives of children and youth with autism around the world by generating awareness and providing meaningful information. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have been lucky enough to have the design and production of our scarves kindly sponsored, but we will need to pay to ship these scarves out to our celebs. And we need your support. This is an essential piece of the puzzle that will directly ensure this project is a success.</p>
<p>If you donate $49 or more, we will send you a free 6-Degree Project scarf!</p>
<p>We are poor students coming accross many costs along the way... please help us realize our goals and donate now!!</p>
<p>Any extra funds will be donated to Autism Speaks Canada.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By having members of our community connect to these celebrities, it will allow community members to feel empowered and make a greater impact around the world, and it will increase awareness for those living with autism. These celebrities are admired by millions of viewers. People listen to them, and will be motivated to understand what it means to have Autism, and how they can create better environments for those around them living with Autism.</p>
<p>The project vision came from Carly Fleischmann, an autistic girl who has become a famous advocate for the disorder. We are learning so much from one another, and hopefully our story will serve as an example for acceptance and friendship between people of different abilities and struggles. </p>

</div></div>","The Six Degree Project
The Six Degree Project is a grassroots initiative, developed by passionate students in Toronto dedicating to creating social change. The project is spearheaded collaboratively by autistic Northern student and autism advocate Carly Fleischmann, and students Emily Albert and Mia Kibel. We feel that though autism is growing more and more prevalent, it is highly misunderstood. Our aim is to foster acceptance and understanding.
The objective is to get celebrities who are constantly in the media eye to participate by wearing an Autism-blue scarf! 
We are committed to improving the lives of children and youth with autism around the world by generating awareness and providing meaningful information. 
 


What We Need & What You Get
We have been lucky enough to have the design and production of our scarves kindly sponsored, but we will need to pay to ship these scarves out to our celebs. And we need your support. This is an essential piece of the puzzle that will directly ensure this project is a success.
If you donate $49 or more, we will send you a free 6-Degree Project scarf!
We are poor students coming accross many costs along the way... please help us realize our goals and donate now!!
Any extra funds will be donated to Autism Speaks Canada.
 
 


The Impact
By having members of our community connect to these celebrities, it will allow community members to feel empowered and make a greater impact around the world, and it will increase awareness for those living with autism. These celebrities are admired by millions of viewers. People listen to them, and will be motivated to understand what it means to have Autism, and how they can create better environments for those around them living with Autism.
The project vision came from Carly Fleischmann, an autistic girl who has become a famous advocate for the disorder. We are learning so much from one another, and hopefully our story will serve as an example for acceptance and friendship between people of different abilities and struggles.

<h1>Axess is RFID-blocking</h1>
<p>To prevent your sensitive credit card information from being subjected to “electronic pickpocketing” or other methods of wirelessly accessing your credit card info or personal information; all Axess wallets have an RFID-blocking pocket where special material will protect your sensitive cards (similar to physically wrapping your credit cards in tin foil). The RFID-blocking material used by Axess have successfully gone through substantial testing and verification by a third-party inspection firm.</p>
<p>I left some pockets without the RFID-blocking material, so that you can still scan your subway card and access cards without having to remove the cards from the wallet each time. (Being an avid commuter myself, I find it very annoying to have to remove the subway card from the wallet each time I needed to scan, hence I left some pockets without the RFID-blocking material). The wallets will also come with a physical marker in the pockets that are RFID-blocking.</p>
<h3>""Being able to have your credit cards protected whilst still having the convenience of using a transport or work pass card inside the wallet will appeal to many"".  </h3>

A lightweight Front Wallet
Sitting on your wallet for long hours is not very comfortable! It also ruins your credit cards. That is why I created Axess, which is designed to fit seamlessly in your front pocket so that you don’t have to sit on your bulky wallet. 
Each design is half the size of a regular wallet, yet fits the cash and cards you usually carry around in a regular billfold.

My mission is to create a new and comfortable wallet experience for your front pocket and it can become possible with your help!


Model 05. ""Superior"" (open on two sides so as to easily access bills). All wallets fit in your front pocket without adding unnecessary bulk.


Model 01 ""Vanquish"" (blue)



Model 03 Smooth in all colors (caramel, black and blue).





Axess Front Wallets was designed to be unobtrusive and lays very flat in your front pocket.

Durable Craftsmanship

Every component of Axess Front Wallets is hand cut, hand stitched and handmade, including the Italian vegetable tanned leather itself – which adds a level of care and attention and quality to each product that a mass produced product will never achieve. The result is a durable wallet in high quality leather that remains tight for years.

Axess is RFID-blocking
To prevent your sensitive credit card information from being subjected to “electronic pickpocketing” or other methods of wirelessly accessing your credit card info or personal information; all Axess wallets have an RFID-blocking pocket where special material will protect your sensitive cards (similar to physically wrapping your credit cards in tin foil). The RFID-blocking material used by Axess have successfully gone through substantial testing and verification by a third-party inspection firm.
I left some pockets without the RFID-blocking material, so that you can still scan your subway card and access cards without having to remove the cards from the wallet each time. (Being an avid commuter myself, I find it very annoying to have to remove the subway card from the wallet each time I needed to scan, hence I left some pockets without the RFID-blocking material). The wallets will also come with a physical marker in the pockets that are RFID-blocking.
""Being able to have your credit cards protected whilst still having the convenience of using a transport or work pass card inside the wallet will appeal to many"".

The following pockets are RFID-blocking (they will also be marked with a physical card):




All Axess models comes in a cotton bag that could also be used for storing the wallet in.





Model No. 03 ""Smooth"" Compact Wallet; Axess Front Wallet fits more than you expect while keeping the size minimal.

Model 06, ""Admire"" Strap Wallet (blue color).  






Model No. 06, ""Admire"", (Caramel Color). The ""strap wallet"" holds a lot of bills, similar to a money clip.

Saffiano leather variation  
Models 2 and 4 are made in Saffiano leather, which is a type of textured genuine leather, which is common in modern day luxury accessories. Saffiano is scratch proof and robust and makes for a great wallet material.




Model No. 04, ""Triumph"", (Caramel Color). Saffiano is a scratch proof genuine leather material used by modern luxury accessory brands. Its robust & durable surface makes for an ideal wallet material.



It’s time to stash your old billfold in the drawer.

We have different pieces suitable for your style, comfortable on your wrists and detail that will spark a conversation anywhere you go.Built like aircraft instrument panels and inspired by the culture and traditions of Hong Kong, the collections pay homage to the old age glorious manufacturing roots.  With a humble heart and inheriting this spirit, we pooled a team of industry veterans from our local elites to create a timepiece collection that symbolises our city’s virtue. We are here to tell the world what Hong Kong stands for.   Every aspect of the watch pays homage to the city I was born in. From the brand, design concept, development, materials, assembly and quality assurances all represent the Hong Kong spirit.  Case backs on our watches are all inscribed with “Built in Hong Kong”, reflecting what Hong Kong stands for.We emphasize as the creation of our brand, its design concept, development, material, and quality assurance which all reflect the Hong Kong Spirit of perseverance and our attitude to excellence.The material sourced and used is high quality and the details are particular.   Another major inspiration for the creation of the watches was my father, he used to tell me stories about the 1960s, he would play with his friends in the streets and on the roofs of To Kwa Wan in Kowloon City.  They would look across and see low flying planes landing and taking off. They vowed to be able to one day fly on the planes having achieved success in their lives.Born in Hong Kong I wanted to build something that represented the city of old. The city was known for its watch making, low flying planes and dreams of making it BIG.  We are watchmakers in Hong Kong, we’ve been designing watches for decades. We believe in creating eye catching pieces that use the finest materials, a watch you can be proud to wear and that gets people talking. BP002 Chronograph First BP004 Tourbillon Propeller  Our watches share a special design, not just a top loaded feature, but structurally designed to have a cup shaped viewing from the side.This way our watches can be perfectly seated on the wrists of our wearers. Allowing the wearers to fully enjoy the complete looks our watches give.  All our watches are designed and hand assembled by our team in Hong Kong, we have experience of creating high-end watches for high-end brands that sell these same watches for thousands of dollars.  The feeling of the soft, premium quality Italian leather touching your wrist. Size, that that feels just right... as if the strap was crafted for you individually.  Colour, that matches your watch perfectly - creating a look of a thousand-dollar-timepiece.That is precisely what you are getting.After you have made a pledge, we’ll ask for your wrist measurements. Then, our professional craftsmen will tailor a stylish strap for your personally, so you have the perfect wearing experience.  Our Tourbillon collection is inspired by daring pilots and the propellers that let them explore the unknown.   These watches are made for millionaires, the reason they are so expensive is because the movement is so precise. The intricate details of this watch and how its perfectly balanced is what leads to high prices. We've been able to recreate this and due to the fact we are missing out middle men we've been able to cut the costs WITHOUT compromising on quality meaning you can now wear millionaire watches.  Tourbillon watches are really expensive as it takes 100s of hours to actually make one, these watches are built like formula one cars using really expensive machinery.  We've been able to cut this cost as we are the direct makers of this product, all our watches are hand made here in Hong Kong.  Within the 43mm IP Rose Gold case, the outer track holds the hour indications finished in a polished IP Rose Gold applied indexes, pairing with the small minutes track in mountain cut finished embossed indexes. The hour and minute hands are carefully designed and chosen to retain the heritage of aviation watches; pairing with a beautiful mountain cut finish to create a classy yet humble trait.  Moving closer into the centre, Our Burlap logo is precisely embossed and applied onto our dial as well as the Tourbillon logo at the 6H position, to create a luxury finish with 3D embossment.    Slowly moving our eyes downwards to the 6H position, our tailored Tourbillon is held within a diamond cut polished finish opening slot; contained with an applied matte finished logo with it resembling an aircraft flying on the horizon with the Tourbillon acting as the propeller engine.        Inside the outermost tracks, the watch holds 12 applied indexes indicating the hour track; the ratio to the case is just right, clear, easy to read yet not stealing the limelight. Moving closer to the centre, there is an opaque date window/panel, designed to see through as time passes by.    In the centre, the 3 chronograph subdials are specially lined up to pay homage and to recreate an iconic feature found on aircraft and automobile instrument panels. Of which they are proportionally rounded-embossed, also designed in details to resemble a classic roundel as a flying heritage.  The 7 mm diameter crown is carefully engraved with fine lines, and the upper and lower chronograph buttons are polished to a smooth surface. The refracting illuminance is different. The three-dimensional effect echoes the level of the dial, making this series unique.    Choose from over 4 colours, you will be able to choose the colour at the end of the campaign.               STORY OF BURLAP Burlap is started as a natural, tough yet flexible fabric, known for its multipurpose nature.

Special Edition

 
Origin Collection

Our goal was to create a timepiece that would last for generations but also had the convenience of modern features. ORIGIN was born.
 

 
 

 
Origin is in the press! This is not our first collection but this one is special because it could revolutionize the watch industry. 

 
 

 
 
The open-heart dial and see-through back cover puts Origin’s intricate self-winding mechanism on display, the complex Automatic mechanisms that keeps the watch infinitely wound as it is worn daily. The Origin does not need a battery for timekeeping! 

 
 

 
We chose minimalist lines that hint at the modern while respecting centuries of watchmaking heritage. The Origin complements your personal style and puts classic style on your wrist for any occasion. 
Stylish

Casual

Sport

 
 

 
Origin's mechanical Japanese movement is alive with 21,600 beats per hour and 24 jewels for superior timekeeping accuracy and a power reserve of 41 hours between wearings.
 

 
Lights to guide you
Origin features sweeping hands with a Luminous layer and Lum-filled, diamond cut indexes at the 12, 3, 6 and 9 o'clock position to make checking the time visible both day and night, indoors or out.

</div><div> <p></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Wondering about this unconventional hoodie right here?</p>
<p>It all started a few years ago when we stumbled upon an online article displaying a hoodie based on a Western suit of armor. “What a fantastic product,” we thought. “How come there isn’t one based on traditional Japanese armor?” We wanted one so badly that we searched all over the internet, but apparently such apparel did not exist in Japan.</p>
<p>""If it doesn't exist, why not bring it into existence?""</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">And so, 2 years ago, we titled our project ""Samurai Armor Hoodie"" and began developing.</span></p>
<p>For 2 years, we designed prototype after prototype, until finally, in the winter of 2015, it was completed and scheduled for release. The hoodies were released at 32,000 Yen in Japan, and before we knew it, they were completely sold out.</p>
<p>Now, with this campaign, we would like to bring a further improved version of these hoodies to fans around the world! We will offer free shipping worldwide, and for our first few Indiegogo contributors only, we are offering an early bird discount of $270 for one hoodie, and $750 for the full set of all three! (Quantities at the early bird discount price are limited, so claim the perk before it fills up.)</p>

Wondering about this unconventional hoodie right here?
It all started a few years ago when we stumbled upon an online article displaying a hoodie based on a Western suit of armor. “What a fantastic product,” we thought. “How come there isn’t one based on traditional Japanese armor?” We wanted one so badly that we searched all over the internet, but apparently such apparel did not exist in Japan.
""If it doesn't exist, why not bring it into existence?""
And so, 2 years ago, we titled our project ""Samurai Armor Hoodie"" and began developing.
For 2 years, we designed prototype after prototype, until finally, in the winter of 2015, it was completed and scheduled for release. The hoodies were released at 32,000 Yen in Japan, and before we knew it, they were completely sold out.
Now, with this campaign, we would like to bring a further improved version of these hoodies to fans around the world! We will offer free shipping worldwide, and for our first few Indiegogo contributors only, we are offering an early bird discount of $270 for one hoodie, and $750 for the full set of all three! (Quantities at the early bird discount price are limited, so claim the perk before it fills up.)

We designed these hoodies so that...



The user can freely create and attach their own “tatemono” crests (the frontal decoration that adorns the front of the helmet of traditional Japanese samurai armor) to their hoodies.


They are casual enough for everyday wear.


They are machine washable.


They provide great protection against the cold.


They incorporate as many parts of the traditional Japanese samurai armor as possible.




Fans in Japan said...
 



I went to a party in my samurai hoodie, and it became the topic that everyone was talking about! It was great!


This hoodie is such a cool way to keep warm when I’m fishing or on my bike.

The thick fabric made this hoodie the perfect gear for airsoft survival games!






For worldwide release, we’ve made the following improvements…



Created 3 different colored versions.


Enhanced the comfort of the hoodies.


Gave the look a sharper finish.


Simplified the design so that it’s more suitable for everyday wear.

Added a design featuring the character “bu” (武) from “bushi”, meaning samurai warrior, on the back.









DETAILS





Size Chart




Let’s take a closer look...




The body of the hoodie is 100% cotton.

It’s machine washable, too!




・The patterns are not printed with ink but flock, making for a soft and durable design.




・Each stitch is embroidered elegantly.



・The himo (cord) is made with traditional Kaga-Yuzen silk dyeing technique (What is Kaga-Yuzen?)・The himo (cord) is removable as well.






・There’s a loop for your finger, too, just like the real thing!






・The shoulder pieces are also removable.



 ・ “Bu” (武) for “bushi” (meaning samurai warrior in Japanese) is written on the back.





・References of real armor were traced to ensure that the armor pieces for the wrist, arms, and head are all reproduced authentically.



Mask Pieces







They function as neckwarmers as well.
They are adjustable by elastic straps.






Tatemono (Crest) Pieces



The “tatemono” crest pieces can be easily attached and removed. Just fit the conveniently-located buttons on the hoodie through the slits on the crest piece.


You can design and create your own original “tatemono” crest pieces, too! Just cut a slit on your design, and attach it!

We focused on the following concepts...



Creating that which does not yet exist.


Creating something suitable for everyday use.


Creating an item that is both durable and appealing enough to be worn for years to come.


Creating something that will both appeal to guys as cool and appeal to girls as cute.

</div><h3> </h3><h3>Beta Testers</h3><div>We want to thank everyone who is helping with the jacket testing procedure. We have 10 fully functional prototypes being tested by friends and some specialists in outdoor sports, fashion, wearable technology, etc. We are not only receiving some super nice pictures, but we are also getting excellent feedback about how to improve the jacket.</div><div>#redderlife, #nofilter, #nomodels, #realpeople, #truefun, #globalfriends, #reddercommunity, #leanstartup, #growthhacking, #enjoyingtogether, #redderpassion, #crowdfunding, #redderbackers, #itshappening</div><div> </div><div>

<div> </div>
<div>And with the feedback of our community, we have already started improving the jacket. So don´t hesitate to send us your comments, we will definitely try to continue making the product better and better throughout the whole process. In this case, the new model already incorporates five improvements:</div>
<div>
<b>1. EXTRA POCKET.</b> One of the top requests from the testers was to have an extra external pocket in the left side of the chest, and here it is.</div>
<div>
<b>2.  LYCRA (R) CUFFS WITH THUMB LOOP.</b> To avoid heat lose and have extra comfort, we have attended the request from the community to have this feature added.</div>
<div>
<b>3. CORD ZIPPER PULLS.</b> Many people will use the jacket in extreme cold conditions, using gloves. These pulls make it unnecessary to take off your gloves when zipping or unzipping the jacket or pockets.</div>
<div>
<b>4. TOP QUALITY VELCRO (R).</b> In line with the rest of the materials used in the jacket, we have now incorporated the highest quality Velcro (R) available to avoid any problems even under continuous extreme conditions.</div>
<div>
<b>5. TWO-WAY MAIN ZIPPER.</b> Need to adjust or take anything from inside the jacket? Simply unzip from bottom to top as much as you need and avoid exposing the body front.</div>
<div>The picture below also shows what the full-black jacket looks like.</div>

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">And we cannot forget about the battery, which is a key part of the full experience.

</div></div>","The Jacket (Tech specs)In a nutshell, the Redder Heated Jacket is a light, comfortable jacket with integrated heating system to keep you warm anywhere.  We use the highest quality raw materials and top-notch technology combined with a world class design process to produce the new generation heated jacket that you can wear with equal comfort and style.From a more technical standpoint, Redder jacket uses high quality materials and components, including 95% polyester and 5% spandex bonded polar fleece for the Shell, 100% polyester touch weight thermal polar fleece for the body lining and 100% polyester 210T taffeta for the sleeve lining. The jacket has three heating zones with three heating levels to guarantee comfort in any kind of environment. It is certified according to different international standards and it comes with two years guarantee. 
 

Redder jacket is the only heated jacket in the market that suits all kind of situations, including outdoor sports, social events and even allows you to choose your preferred color combination. We start with different combinations of black, grey and red, and will make more colors available as the number of backers increases. After you make your contribution we will send you an email to confirm your preferred color and size.
 


 

 


IMPORTANT NOTE: We will contact you after your purchase to ask for your preferred color (and size)
 
The Redder jacket is also waterproof and breathable. It comes with YKK zippers and it gets its energy from an external battery that can also be used to charge your cellphone or any other portable device. 

 

 
What is Redder?Redder is a global brand of outdoor clothing, apparel and functional garments and complements with the main goal of enabling people fulfill their passions, regardless whether those passions are hiking in extreme conditions, surf in a quite beach, enjoy a calm walk at night or simply approach their daily life with an extra comfort partner.  You can also have a look at the interview with our CEO to have a better understanding about the brand.  Product details

 

 

 

 


 Beta TestersWe want to thank everyone who is helping with the jacket testing procedure. We have 10 fully functional prototypes being tested by friends and some specialists in outdoor sports, fashion, wearable technology, etc. We are not only receiving some super nice pictures, but we are also getting excellent feedback about how to improve the jacket.#redderlife, #nofilter, #nomodels, #realpeople, #truefun, #globalfriends, #reddercommunity, #leanstartup, #growthhacking, #enjoyingtogether, #redderpassion, #crowdfunding, #redderbackers, #itshappening 

 
And with the feedback of our community, we have already started improving the jacket. So don´t hesitate to send us your comments, we will definitely try to continue making the product better and better throughout the whole process. In this case, the new model already incorporates five improvements:

1. EXTRA POCKET. One of the top requests from the testers was to have an extra external pocket in the left side of the chest, and here it is.

2.  LYCRA (R) CUFFS WITH THUMB LOOP. To avoid heat lose and have extra comfort, we have attended the request from the community to have this feature added.

3. CORD ZIPPER PULLS. Many people will use the jacket in extreme cold conditions, using gloves. These pulls make it unnecessary to take off your gloves when zipping or unzipping the jacket or pockets.

4. TOP QUALITY VELCRO (R). In line with the rest of the materials used in the jacket, we have now incorporated the highest quality Velcro (R) available to avoid any problems even under continuous extreme conditions.

5. TWO-WAY MAIN ZIPPER. Need to adjust or take anything from inside the jacket? Simply unzip from bottom to top as much as you need and avoid exposing the body front.
The picture below also shows what the full-black jacket looks like.

And if you are interested in how we made the prototype for beta testers to try, check the video below.
  What limited and exclusive rewards will you get?Redder jacket recommended retail price is 199$+taxes+shipping but during the crowdfunding campaign we will have promos starting at 119$. We use a next generation production process to get the lowest production cost for the backers. All backers will receive a 5X5 reward, which is a 5% discount for the next five years in any product purchased through redder.life.
And we cannot forget about the battery, which is a key part of the full experience. We don´t produce them ourselves nor use an OEM version... because we have partnered up with one of the top brands in China to complement our jacket with a 10.000 mAh battery from Mi (previously known as Xiaomi) Check out all the details in the information below and keep in mind that with this battery you can get up to 14 hours of continued use.
 


 

Also, as we reach different goals, we will unlock more color diversity, special limited editions and more surprises. Size Charts & How to MeasureFind the charts below to determine your size. If you are in the borderline between two sizes, order the smaller size if you are a ""slim fit type of person"" or the larger size if you prefer a looser fit. If your measurements for chest and waist correspond to two different sizes, order the size indicated by your chest measurement.IMPORTANT NOTE: We will contact you after your purchase to ask for your size (and preferred color) Bust: Measure around the fullest part of the bust area, keeping the tape level under your arms and across your back.Chest: Measure around the fullest part of the chest, keeping the tape level under your arms and across your back.Waist: Measure around the narrowest part of the waist (typically the small of your back and where your body bends side to side).Sleeve Length: Bend the arm slightly and measure the length from the center back of the neck, to the shoulders tip, along the outside of the arm, and to the wrist Our team
We are a very passionate team, with extensive experience in cross border trading, fashion, technology, start-ups and crowdfunding projects. Our team has experience in different regions of the world as well and we are all very involved in this project, willing to make it to production phase and being able to deliver an awesome jacket to all our backers.
 
 

 
 Exchange Policy

By taking the measures correctly and following the size chart carefully, jackets should fit you nicely. If you still would rather get a different jacket for whatever reason, it should be ok but keep in mind that extra charges may apply for the shipping.
 
Warranty
The jackets will be produced under the strictest quality standards and we will implement a very rigorous quality control. Our intention is to ensure product quality and durability. Provided the jacket is used under normal circumstances, garment is guaranteed for one year and the whole heating system for two years. But don´t worry, we are sure you will be able to enjoy your Redder jacket for much longer without any problem.
 
Frequently Asked Questions
 



What kind of zippers do you use? All zippers used in the jackets will be YKK. 

What is the weight of your jackets? Final product weight is about 900g for female fitting and 1100g for male fitting. 

Is your jacket waterproof? Absolutely! Not only for your comfort, but also for the heating system to work properly and safely, the jacket is completely waterproof. 

Is the jacket breathable? We had to find a compromise between different specifications, so the jacket is breathable but within certain limits that will not affect other properties. 

Why don´t you have woman and man designs? We believe in gender equality. Our team composition is just one of many examples. In that sense, we created a ""genderless"" jacket with only fitting and sizing adjustments, but no difference in overall style. If you are interested in a more customized product, drop us a note in our social media channels, by email or directly in the comments section. 

Does the jacket accept machine washing? Yes. 

Is the jacket self-drying? No. Tumble dry low heat. 

May I use the jacket battery to recharge my cellphone? Yes. The external battery can be used to charge any device depending on the capacity. 

I´m very interested in your product, can I get extra discount if I buy a big quantity? At this moment we are focused in our crowdfunding campaign and do not have any wholesalling agreements in our roadmap, nor are we allowed to offer extra discounts because we are already offering the lowest possible prices for our indiegogo backers. However, we are very happy to hear that you like our product and it makes us want to work harder in the future. Feel free to contact us any time with your comments or suggestions. 

In what countries and currencies can I buy the jacket? We will send the jacket to any country that can be reached through standard methods without setting any additional restrictions. The prices are specified in USD but it will converted to your local currency by the payment gateway (for your reference, as of 29th of August 2016, the super early birds jacket equivalent price in EUR is around 101EUR.

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Hey Everyone!</p>
<p>I am honored you have come upon my page and am so excited to create my first collection. <em>Bragonier</em> is a high end designer label striving to be the best of the best and get going in the fashion industry.</p>
<h1>Our Story:</h1>
<p>At a very young age, Matthew showed an interest in fashion and photography after moving to California. At age 14, Matthew began attending community college classes and worked his way through the photography program. He spent each summer working in the studio, or behind a computer in design class, or getting his hands dirty creating art. After graduating high school at age 16 with over 60 college credits he utilized his time as an intern for two fashion photographers in his local area. While acting as an assistant, he applied the skills he had learned and put them to practice outside of a classroom. Matthew then transferred to a University at age 18 and still is currently working for his Bachelor of Visual Arts degree studying Photography &amp; Graphic Design. Attaining the perfect eye for fashion and style, he started dressing the part and obtaining and obsession towards the industry. Second semester in, Matthew realized he needed to take a break and re-evaluate where his real goals and aspirations were laid out. Taking 9 months off of school he was able to achieve new goals and become even more specific in his future career. Starting with dressing himself, Matthew became an expert thrift shopper, which led to reconstructing clothes, and eventually moved on to designing and creating his own fashion. Recognizing the path, Matthew started studying, sketching, and designing everything from menswear, to handbags, and of course women's clothing. Setting up networks, assembling a team, and getting on board with the fashion industry, Matthew is now ready to launch <em>Bragonier</em> and create his first collection of women's clothing and accessories, as well as men's (upon expansion).</p>
<h1>Goal:</h1>
<p>Get the funds behind the concept. <strong>Why?</strong> Because Matthew is a full time student, working two jobs, and surviving on bare minimum, using every last penny just to keep up with bills. <strong>Using the funds</strong> Matthew and his team will create a first collection of 8-12 outfits for <em>Women's styles</em>. Using his skills, Matthew will take the finished products and photograph them like an editorial campaign to archive for marketing, then sell them to customers.<em> </em>Using the profits earned, we will put it straight back into <em>Bragonier </em>towards making double the amount of product. From there, the brand will keep expanding to get itself out there and put Matthew's fashion into your hands. From the rise in our expansions we will move on from just <em>women's trends</em> and start creating <em>mens products</em> as well.</p>
<p><em>All items from the collection will be available for purchase online, so you will be able to shop from anywhere around the world. Bragonier's website will undergo a reconstruction, adding a store and styling page. Each item purchased, you will be able to imput your measurements <em>(excluding Bags/Clutches)</em>, and we will make the item post according to your purchase.</em></p>
<h1>If we exceed our $4,000 Goal:</h1>
<p>""It would be amazing to see people really interested and supportive towards my dream as a fashion designer. Why can't I think larger than what I just 'need'. If we make more than what it takes to create just one collection, we will take the funds and put it to even better use. Expansion of workspace, more product production, and even shows for presentation of my designs. If I was able to put on a fashion show, then supporters and buyers would be able to attend and see my products live, meet me, and allow me opportunity to make connections within the fashion industry."" - Matthew</p>
<p><strong> - Stretch Goals (why not dream big!)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>$8,000 - Two collections will be produced and released for purchasing.</strong></li>
<li><strong>$10,000 - Small Business plan will be put into action. Hiring a full staff for yearly production, sales, and management. </strong></li>
<li><strong>$20,000 - Guaranteed Runway Fashion Show to present Collection to supporters and the fashion industry and possible incorporation investors.</strong></li>
<li><strong>$50,000+ - Full Business plan will be put into action. Complete staff, manufacturing, and store/boutique opening. </strong></li>

<h1>Risks &amp; Challenges</h1>
<p>A challenge we face is the comfortability that people have a hard time with. The one's who are afraid to express their individuality with high fashion.</p>
<p>Which is why Matthew and a team of researchers spend day and night researching and studying the latest and best trends, predicting and conceptualizing what is to come to stay one step ahead. Taking what designers do not push forward enough on. Bringing you, the buyer, the best of the best. To give the comfort that one is wearing what is in style and something to be proud of giving an individual the confidence to express their individuality.</p>
<p>Another challenge will be the time that is needed to go into it. As a full time student, and working two jobs, Matthew struggles to find time to spend doing what he really wants to be doing. Using every waking moment towards making progress in his goals and moving one step closer.</p>
<p>Which is why he has taken measure to assure team members to help him in all areas of the business. The more funds received the more time will be made available. If we can make more product to sell than our goal -&gt; more expansion -&gt; bigger team -&gt; (again) more product -&gt; increase in profit -&gt; amplification of business -&gt; hire employees -&gt; x2 expansion -&gt; drop unnecessary priorities -&gt; more time!

We designed this with all the details we look for in our fleeces but can't find in one place. Breathability, warmth, anti-odor, high hip pockets to allow for backpack hip belts, TWO ventilated chest pockets instead of the usual one, YKK zippers, ergonomic zipper pulls, seamless underarms, two big internal elastic dump pockets, and integrated thumb holes. </p><p>What sets this fleece apart, however, is its new and innovative use of Polartec Powerwool on the panels, cuffs, hem, and neck.

Swedish - One who loves life deeply; an enjoyer of life We are a small team of apparel designers who spend our time outdoors. We set out to design outdoor clothing that actually fits and looks just as good on the street as it does on the trail. We want to buy less, take care of what we own, and spend more time outside. We create durable outdoor clothing for people who value experiences more than stuff. We want you to buy our clothing with peace of mind, and we want to keep it out of the landfill, so we are offering what we consider a ""Fair Deal Guarantee.""OVERVIEW:Named for the fabrics used, the Hi-Wool is one part comfy blanket and one part technical outerwear. We designed this with all the details we look for in our fleeces but can't find in one place. Breathability, warmth, anti-odor, high hip pockets to allow for backpack hip belts, TWO ventilated chest pockets instead of the usual one, YKK zippers, ergonomic zipper pulls, seamless underarms, two big internal elastic dump pockets, and integrated thumb holes. What sets this fleece apart, however, is its new and innovative use of Polartec Powerwool on the panels, cuffs, hem, and neck. This fabric is truly incredible. Merino wool's natural antimicrobial properties keep your jacket from getting stinky after hard use. It's soft and smooth on the outer facing to resist pilling, fuzzy and warm on the inner facing to keep you cozy, and has massive amounts of stretch to increase mobility. This is a fleece you can put on and totally forget you're wearing it, with no restrictions to movement at all.The body uses super soft Polartec High Loft, a 72% recycled content high-pile grid fleece with an excellent warmth-to-weight ratio.

I wanted to tell you right up front that The Pramzius watch company has successfully launched two previous watches with crowd-sourced funding -- The Trans Siberian pocket watch for the wrist and the Fall of the Berlin Wall watches, which have actual pieces of the Berlin Wall in the crown. https://www.r2awatches.com/brands/pramzius/So we have a history you can trust! Reach out to any of the previous backers of our watches and they will tell you we not only delivered the watches we promised but most owners of our watches say we met their expectations and then some.The Iron Wolf will be the same. Well-built, delivered and backed by our 2-year warranty. So pledge with confidence! Production is now well underway for May delivery. Will post more updates as they come in.A Medieval legend, a modern military machine and the watches that bring modernity and antiquity together. The Pramzius Iron Wolf watches tell the circa 720-year-old story of the founding of Vilnius, Lithuania and brings to bear watches ready to be the official timekeeper and watches of the Wolf Infantry Fighting Vehicle of Lithuania’s modern NATO ground forces. Read the MBWW review hereBecause legends are made; not born -- Roughly 720 years ago the Grand Duke Gediminas stopped to take a rest near the Vilnia River after a successful day of hunting. He fell into a deep sleep and dreamt of a mighty Iron Wolf standing firm on the crest of a hill and baying with the strength of a hundred wolves. When he woke, he sought the council of his priest to interpret the dream and he told him this:""What is destined for the ruler and the State of Lithuania, is thus: The Iron Wolf represents a castle and a city which will be established by you on this site. This city will be the capital of the Lithuanian lands and the dwelling of their rulers, and the glory of their deeds shall echo throughout the world.""And so, it was as Gediminas founded the great city of Vilnius named for the Vilnia river. Pramzius brings back military meets elegant watches and offers watches truly worthy of legend and a new legend in the field. Tactical watches with precision chronographs, and open-heart automatics that offer mother of pearl and full lume dials are just the beginning.    Every aspect of the Iron Wolf watches ties back to the legend and the vehicle they represents. Anti-reflective sapphire crystal protecting a 10 ATM 316l stainless steel military-grade timepiece with unidirectional rotating bezel marked off by the teeth of the wolf, sandwich dial options, and custom-made art on the case back of the watches inspired by the Iron Wolf legend are just some of the features of these exceptional watches.  Genuine Mother of Pearl, Genuine Carbon Fiber and Full Lume Sandwich dials on the watches. Custom Bracelet, Handmade Leather and NATO Nylon come with all the watches. The bracelet is custom made to fit and the NATO/ZULU style straps are made of only the best, extra heavy nylon for the watches.The leather straps for these watches are built by Constantine Hussar, also known as The Strap Lord. The heavy-duty bound watch straps are leather with a canvas upper. You have your choice of more bold or more subtle artwork burned into the canvas for the strap on your watch.Constantine hand builds these amazing custom watch straps. We want to stress that each individual strap is made one at a time by hand with only the finest of strap materials for watches. These straps easily go for $100 or more as stand-alone items.

Gunsights on the fully functional sub dials and on the second hand on the chrono watches speak to the Wolf Fighting Vehicle along with the gun turret embedded in the crown.  We incorporate many subtle and not-so-subtle elements into the watches to illustrate its DNA as Military watches.The fully functional subdials on both the automatic and chrono watches are inspired by gun sights and on the chrono there are crosshairs at the end of the watche's sweep second hand.Embedded in the crown is a gun turret which also speaks to the infantry vehicle.Pramzius uses 15 individual silk-screen layers of lume in all of our watches and the Iron Wolf is no exception.

All other models of the watches come with top-quality lume at all the key indication points.To complete the story of the Iron Wolf on the watch, we commissioned special, custom caseback art inspired by the imagery associated with the Iron Wolf legend. The official logo of the Wolf vehicle is on the dial of every execution.

<p>As all processes on the production line are housed within Singapore, the close integration of physical distribution and materials management will avoid bottlenecking and will help speed up the completion rate.

As all processes on the production line are housed within Singapore, the close integration of physical distribution and materials management will avoid bottlenecking and will help speed up the completion rate. Moreover, due to its close proximity between stations of production processes  and assembly, transportation time and costs will be kept to a minimum.
I am confident for a shorter lead time than is expected, despite the current COVID-19 conditions. 
 Special Thanks 

Tameem, our craftsman     Elly our 3D designer 
I would like to give a special thanks to Tameem from Orphic Concepts, my jewelry advisor,  for so much of his guidance & help. To Ely and Matt from 3D matters, for showing that no design project, however small, is beyond them lending their expertise and professionalism. A quick mention to Mrs Tanja Sadow from JDMIS, Jo Soh from TAFF and all the people who encouraged and supported me throughout my journey.

<p><b>Campaign Summary</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Frank Chester’s New Form Collections is a jewelry line focused
on bringing Frank’s geometric discoveries to the world through beautiful
pendant and sculpture designs using new techniques in 3D manufacturing.  This
initial collection is based on Frank’s discovery of a 7-sided geometric form
discovered in the year 2000, the Chestahedron, that he later found to be the
inner and outer geometry of the human heart.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><p>Frank is a renowned artist, geometrician and teacher living in
Northern California and has lectured in over a dozen countries, bringing his
discoveries to humanity both practically and aesthetically, while combining art
and science in exciting new ways.  Frank’s initial findings of the
Chestahedron led to further research and discoveries of a new world of undiscovered
geometry, its applications to our world
of matter<b> </b>and a deeper understanding of our relationship to form.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/639468/files/20140528145159-Chestahedron_forms_V01.8.jpg?1402430121"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p><b>(Rhythm/Balance/Positive Space/Full <b>Chestahedron Designs</b>- Pictured)</b><br/></p><p></p>

</p><p>
</p><p>This campaign is vital towards reaching the goal of bringing
Frank's revolutionary discoveries to you in the highest quality and preserving
these remarkable works through a permanent digitized form catalogue.  We
are focused on preserving Frank’s forms using computer-aided design (CAD), manufacturing
the first completed jewelry, and then launching the collection professionally making the Chestahedron and Frank's other forms known throughout the
world.  The jewelry line is a relevant and powerful way to connect and
share Frank’s discoveries both collectively and individually. </p><p></p><p>Not since the time of Leonard Da Vinci has there been a
revolution in geometric understanding such as with Frank Chester’s work.  With
your support and contributions we hope to reach the general public and

moment at a time.  The work also furthers
NFT’s overall goals of promoting and realizing “truth, beauty and goodness” in
that the forms are geometrically and mathematically lawful, beautiful and
worthwhile in connecting people to each other. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/639472/files/20140528161925-IMG_1373_L.jpg?1402430139"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>(Unity <b>Chestahedron Designs</b>- Pictured Above)</b><br/><p></p>

We started off as an underwear subscription service that launched on Kickstarter. But things really took off when we came out with our first line of SilverTech odorless underwear. Now we’re back with an improved line of SilverTech underwear. We enhanced our design for more comfort, heat regulation, durability, and breathability. We partnered up with Polygiene®, one of the most advanced and sustainable silver fabric treatments in the world, to give you an even better anti-microbial, odorless experience. All our underwear and tees are made with 100% recycled nylon, making them more comfortable, more breathable, and more durable, while reducing our environmental footprint. Welcome to SilverTech 2.0.  NASA-Inspired, Anti-Microbial Silver UnderwearSilver is a well-known oligodynamic material - which means it naturally kills 99.9% of bacteria, fungi, and other microbes. Fun fact: NASA uses it as a method of purifying water in the International Space Station. Clever, aren’t they?All our underwear is treated with Polygiene®, a sustainable, low-concentration recycled silver chloride treatment. That makes them powerfully anti-microbial, without damaging the environment.Our Polygiene® treated underwear naturally rids itself of odor-causing bacteria and fungi - making them stay fresh for weeks. That means you can wear them more and wash them less.Best of all, this effect doesn’t fade and will last the entire life-cycle of your underwear.  A Sustainable Fabric ChoiceWe decided to make our boxer briefs and t-shirts out of advanced recycled nylon - for superior comfort, moisture wicking, heat regulation, and durability.Italian manufactured nylon is the best in the industry. They are well known for making super light, super soft, extremely breathable nylon with 100% recycled raw materials and zero chemical processing.Nylon is more durable and stronger than typical fabrics. It also wicks away moisture - keeping you as dry as possible.You don’t need to worry about ironing or shrinking. Nylon is wrinkle-resistant and doesn’t form creases easily. It maintains shape even after being thrown in the wash.  Less Seams. More Durability And Comfort.Seams are a weak point on activewear. They add extra weight, and can be uncomfortable against your skin. SilverTech 2.0 boasts a zero seam knit, making the wear lighter, stronger, and much more comfortable.Lightweight Movement: Feel the freedom of movement and lightness of the fabric. The seamless design makes it feel lighter than air. You’ll barely notice it as you move unhindered - no restrictions, completely free.Stress-Free Knit: Because there are no seams, SilverTech 2.0 garments have no stress points. This means you don’t have to worry about your fabric scrunching, puckering, or tearing when you do need to wash it.More Wear, Less Tear: Seamless design ensures that there are no weaknesses in the garment. The fabric supports itself rather than relying on stitching that can tear, fray or catch. This makes it extremely durable in any circumstance. No more loose threads, frayed ends, or gaping holes. Wear SilverTech 2.0 over and over again knowing that it’ll continue to stay strong. Thermodynamic Body RegulationSilverTech 2.0 was thoughtfully designed to give you the best temperature regulation possible. From material integration to apparel engineering, we made sure you’ll stay cool when you’re active, and warm when you’re not.Heat-Regulating Materials: The Polygiene® treatment and recycled nylon work together to provide powerful heat regulationin any environment.The Polygiene® silver is engineered to be breathable and it thermodynamically interacts with your body temperature - keeping you warm when it’s cold, and cool when it’s hot.Nylon works both as a sweat-wicking material and a breathable, thermal insulator - making sure that you stay dry and comfortable, no matter what.Combined, you get a powerful, heat-regulating material that works like a smart hydro-flask for your body.Advanced Ventilation: Our garments are designed with vents in critical sweat-prone zones, allowing air to cool you down, and sweat to easily wick away from your body.From the Polygiene® silver treatment to the nylon, SilverTech is made from 100% recycled materials.Mechanically recycled nylon is only made from regenerated raw materials. 100% composed of mechanically recycled nylondeveloped in Italy, our nylon’s raw materials are sourced from post-industrial waste fibre, yarn from spinning factories, and waste from weaving mills.The process is purely mechanical, saving CO2 emissions and water usage by up to 90%.Polygiene® is bluesign® approved - which means it meets strict environmental protection and textile manufacturing standards. All of the silver is sourced from recycled electronic, industrial, and photographic waste.  Many silver treatments release harmful nano-materials as they break down. Polygiene® silver is not a nano-silver - which means it won’t leak harmful substances and nanoparticles into your skin during wear or into our precious water systems when you wash it.  The fashion industry is the second most polluting industry in the world, and two-thirds of that waste occurs during consumer use - particularly through washing and drying.SilverTech 2.0 is not only created with the most sustainable materials on the market, but it cuts down on consumer impact by reducing the need to wash your clothes as often.Because you wash less, you use less water, less energy, and damage your clothes less. When your clothes aren’t washed as often, they’ll last longer - so they won’t end up in the landfill with your other underwear.  Why we need your pledgeThe fashion industry is a dirty bastard, and we want to change that.

<p>Our products are
about beautiful fabrics in rich textures that are draped and re-cut to create

for a reason, they are not thrown away because people have a love story
with them and to us that means something.<br/></p>

WHAT IS VEGAS RAYS?

The story of Vegas Rays is that of
things picked up on a journey. A modern road trip through, Italy the UK and USA picking up vintage
pieces and stories and mixing them together to create

Our products are
about beautiful fabrics in rich textures that are draped and re-cut to create
more modern, simple and refined silhouettes from their vintage cousins.
We believe things become vintage
for a reason, they are not thrown away because people have a love story
with them and to us that means something.

and beautiful future story of......

<br/><h2>Why is it called a Chi-O Phi?</h2>
<h3>Chi-O stands for Chi-Organizer</h3>
<br/>There are a number of ways to organize the Chi (Ki, Prana) from the ancient techniques of Qi-Gong and yoga, to walking barefoot in the forest or spending time in the ocean. However if you are not inclined to practice these techniques or are unable to make it into nature regularly due to location or lifestyle, how do you support your energy?<br/><br/>The Chi-O Phi is design for exactly this purpose!<br/><br/>Below is a study done with 28 people. The graph shows an average of all 
28 people's Chi Stagnation levels in different situations. First with no
 Cell phone present, next holding the Cell phone in the Right Hand 
(notice the Chi Stagnation goes up also on the left side of the body 
when holding the Cell phone) and finally wearing the Chi-O and holding 
the Cell phone in the right hand.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454080017/hc7opadyq3s3xib50gdg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>As can 
be seen in the live blood analysis below, the Chi-O Phi shows beneficial
 effects, supporting the body to balance itself and enter a more natural
 state, almost as if the test subjects have been exposed to an EMF free 
environment.<br/>
<p>

<br/>
<h3>What is the meaning of Phi?<br/>
</h3>
<p> Phi is the most common pattern
in all of nature, pronounced Fi. It has the number starting with 1.618+ (see below
for more details). This Golden Mean ratio, as it is also known, has been used by artists, architects
and designers for millennia and typifies  the qualities of beauty and perfection.
This ratio can be recognized in much of our environment, from the famous
Fibonacci progression, Da Vinci's drawing of man, pentagrams, the water molecule and even the structure of
our DNA is profoundly based on the golden mean ratio. <br/></p>
<p>It is clear, this pattern
supports our natural harmonics, or resonance.</p>

<br/><h3>How does the Chi-O Phi support me?</h3>Most man made
environments are not in resonance with nature and life. It is becoming
increasingly evident that<b> </b>the structures we build for ourselves to live and 
work in are not often beneficial to our health and biology. Artificial environments and the presence of other unnatural
frequencies disrupt and disorientate the body from being able to tune in with
these natural frequencies, causing a 
de-harmonizing and unbalancing of the body and its functions, creating a disruption in
our general health.<br/><br/>Being in harmony with the natural resonance of life is the foundation
 of the design principles of the Chi-O Phi. The circuitry within the 
Chi-O is composed of a frequency generator that produces a wide range of frequencies found in the natural world, including the 
Schumann Resonance. These energy pulses are transformed into a specific 
light frequency and pattern, emanating from the internal LED that 
illuminates through the crystal gem nestled onto the front of the Chi-O 
Phi. Our body then has a frequency pattern to tune in to.<br/><br/>Our technology also includes the scalar antenna resting within the Chi-O Phi pod. Strategically place
directly under a programmed hologram chip, it creates an Active Scalar 
field
that exalts your energy field, even if your energy levels as low. Passive
Scalar devices rely on your bio-energy to power them and work well if 
your Chi
energy is high. But if your Chi energy is low, a passive device can 
actually drain more of your Chi energy as it attempts to power itself. 
Since the Chi-O is powered via battery, it boosts your Chi even if you 
are feeling low on energy.<br/><p><br/></p>
<p>The pre-programmed hologram cards carry a specific IDF (Intrinsic Data Field) pattern .
This information is then ""broadcast"" into the body and the
environment to produce various supportive harmonizing effects and create a radiant
field that supports the person's system to stay in tune with the frequencies
of Nature. This reduces the negative effects of pulse digital signals (ie: mobile
phones, WiFi, smart meters) and  releases
the stagnation of Chi energy in the body, allowing us to flow with more ease in
life while we continue to live our busy lives, along with these other benefits. <br/></p>

our campaign. One of the main missions of our campaign is to spread a 
message on the importance and influence of EMF frequencies. To honor your 
intention to be part of this awareness your will receive a downloadable 
copy of; ""Regaining Wholeness Through the Subtle Dimensions"" -  
Don Paris Ph.D. (h.c.).  <br/>
<p>(Valued @ $15.95)</p>
<p>Excerpts from the introduction to Regaining Wholeness....<br/></p>
<p>Using the SE-5 1000 to analyze and balance subtle informational fields puts many dimensions literally at our fingertips that would otherwise remain at the edge of our consciousness like a dream hovering at the edge of our remembering, haunting our daily thoughts for recognition. Regaining wholeness through the use of the SE-5 1000 has become an exciting adventure that has opened many new subtle dimensions in my world.</p>
<p>This book is divided in two parts. The first part is written to familiarize the new-comer with the purpose and theory behind the SE-5 1000. You will find the features of the SE-5 1000 to be sometimes astounding and at other times actually hard to believe. Had I not experienced these things, I could easily think this to be a science fiction book. I can assure you, though, that this technology does exist, and I have done my best to describe the results of using this equipment in a language that is both understandable, accurate, and legal.</p>
<p>Part II of the book delves into actual practical applications of the SE-5 1000 with many anecdotal experiences that in older times would have been called miraculous . If ever a technology of miracles were developed, it would be the SE-5 1000.<br/>Part II will be of great benefit to those who already have an SE-5 1000, as well as to those of you who are wondering how this technology can be applied to your life. Will the next bottle of vitamins you buy be your last? <br/></p>
<p>There are many more uses for the SE-5 1000 than I could ever put into a book however, the intent of this book is to help you understand the principles by which the SE-5 1000 functions, which in turn will allow you to use your imagination and come up with other uses that have not yet been discovered. May your path be exciting and full of wondrous surprises.<br/>Don Paris Ph.D. (h.c.)<br/></p>

<h2>Why do we need a Chi-O?<br/>
</h2>
<p>Well, ideally we wouldn't! <br/></p>
<p>However, pulse digital signals in our environment have increased, by some reports, millions of fold in the last 20-30 years. If we think back to when we first were introduced to Motorola and the mobile phone in the 70's it was a rare device. <br/></p>

your back pocket?<br/><br/><p>However as the technology improved and the devices became smaller and more functional, they evolved into more of a personal computer that you could take anywhere and the iPhone and Android were born!</p>
<p>Before we knew it, everyone needed to have a phone! 2014 figures show that there are now over 4.23 Billion telephone users, in what is also a Billion dollar industry.</p>

<br/><br/><h4>What does this all mean for us?</h4>
<p>Firstly, it means that if we are going to be able to use these phones, we need mobile towers that provide the signal for us to use our phones. These towers are permanently pulsing signals out to the ready users wanting to stay connected to the world. This is like second hand smoke, except that we can not simply step outside into the fresh air. The request for even more coverage is always present and these towers are being erected at every viable location. The range of items that we are connecting to are continuously increasing from smart meters, to smart refrigerators, ovens, washing machines and even a smart toothbrush.</p>
<p>There has recently been a documentary made around the increased roll out of  smart meters, discussing the range of inherent implications, called <a href=""https://takebackyourpower.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Take Back Your Power</a>.<br/></p>
<p>Some may question the authenticity of some of these claims, however, there are those who have not believed in the dangers of non-ionising EMF radiation, including Dr. Devra Davis Ph.D. PMH. She served as the President Clinton appointee to the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board from 1994 to 1999. It was under her direction that it became impossible to refuse the building of a telephone cell tower in the area based on health concerns. She has since performed a complete turn around on the issue and is now Founder and President of <a href=""http://ehtrust.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Environmental Health Trust Environmental Health Trust</a>, who consistently provides cutting-edge research 
and education about cellphones and other environmental health hazards 
and promotes constructive policies locally, nationally and 
internationally, bringing you the world's top science and scientists.</p>

<h3>UW Scientist Henry Lai Makes Waves in the Cell Phone Industry</h3>After Lai and Singh’s research finding an effect on DNA was published in
 1995, Lai learned of a full-scale effort to discredit his work. In an 
internal company memo leaked to Microwave News, a publication that 
examines health and environmental effects of electromagnetic radiation, 
Motorola described its plan to “war-game” and undermine Lai’s research.<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thus was launched an epic battle over research and truth. If Lai and 
Singh were correct about the potential impact on brain cells from 
radio-frequency radiation, there could be billions of dollars on the 
line for the cell phone industry in potential liability, leading to 
significant design changes and lost market expansion.<br/></p>Yet the soft-spoken scientist’s steadfast belief in that principle has 
placed his research at the center of a persistent global controversy and
 created powerful enemies that tried to get him fired and essentially 
succeeded in drying up the source of funding for the type of research he
 was doing.<br/><p><a href=""http://www.seattlemag.com/article/nerd-report/nerd-report"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">full article</a></p>

<p>Truly the grandfather of scalar would have to be Nicola Tesla. He didn't use the word scalar, but he created scalar fields with many of his devices to produce ""free energy"".

<p>The circle closes with the development of the newest and most advanced instrument coming from the USA where Radionics first began through Dr. Abrams. <br/></p>
<p>Dr. Willard Frank, Ph.D. physicist, electro-engineer and inventor developed a computerized instrument in 1986, the ‘SE-5 Intrinsic Data Field Analyzer’, and updated the instrument in 1998 later called the SE-5 plus. The SE-5 plus is not a traditional Radionics instrument. It is well known for its analyzing and balancing of Intrinsic Data Fields (IDFs). The face of Radionics has changed dramatically as the understanding of this phenomena is embraced. The SE-5 plus is not used in the traditional sense of medicine, and the gap is ever widening. Since this instrument is so versatile, it is now used in mining, agriculture, business, with new areas of use opening every day.<br/>As with the instruments of de la Warr, Drown and Hieronymus instruments, the SE-5 plus uses a ‘stick plate’ as a detector. This is not the usual rubber membrane, but a thin piece of circuit board material over geometric designs, and scalar antennas underneath which fine tune and amplify the scalar informational fields, IDFs.<br/>Through the use of the computer, dials are used to dial in the ‘Tunings’ but rather one can easily type them into the small pocket computer on the instrument.<br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454183223/glyqbsghqyhhim1pzpqy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>Working with the much simpler analysis method, the time to find the ‘Tunings’ is greatly reduced. The number of usable ‘Tunings’ has now reached over 17,000.<p>After the death of Dr. Frank in 2008, Don Paris Ph.D.(h.c.) redesigned the SE-5 plus and updated it to work with today’s computers. The SE-5 1000 added many new features such as an automatic Replicator, Infra Red Scanning Probe, Electro-luminescent Output cable, Color Light Harmonizer and much more.<br/></p>

<p>An expansive history scalar technology is described in my book, ""Regaining Wholeness
 Through the Subtle Dimensions"", available to all contributors.</p>

<br/><p>The subject of Scalar and IDFs (Intrinsic Data Fields) is outlined in
 my book Regaining Wholeness Through the Subtle Dimensions. (Which you 
get as a perk for even a $1 donation to our Indiegogo program of the 
Chi-O Phi. And Yes, IDFs is a coined phrase to describe something that 
has proven a thousand times over in the field of Radionics over the last
 100 years. </p>
<p> The difficulty with the field of Scalar is that many
 people have picked it up as a catch word to sell everything. The other 
problem is that those that actually understand this type of 
eletro-magnetic phenomena are either in black op programs with high 
security restrictions or are underfunded inventors working in their 
garage. </p>
<p> Finding reliable information about this field is 
difficult, even with the internet, because of the confusion of the <b>Information</b> aspect of Scalar and the <b>Electro-magnetic</b> aspect. I was 
fortunate to have become best friends with several people that have 
actually researched and experimented in this field. Dr. Robert C. Beck 
created a small scalar device that he used to get a signal out of a 
""quiet room"" many stories underground in a military installation. Bob 
was a very close friend and taught me a lot about the Electro-magnetic 
aspects of Scalar. </p>
<p> Eldon Byrd worked in a military program to 
develop Scalar weaponry for about 20 years. He was also a very close 
friend of both Bob Beck and myself. The concepts of using scalar as 
weapons is not a concept. They developed ""terrible"" devices and weapons.
 His greatest experience was the day that Clinton became president and 
they shut down the program and destroyed the research. </p>
<p> Dr. 
Willard Frank AKA William Francis Lawson, was actually the inventor of

Cutting Edge Technology, Designed by Life.
To support us in the World



An in-depth look at the history and the lineage of research into the fields of Radionics and Scalar technology, discussing the range of models that created the Chi-O Phi, the most technologically advanced solution to the problem of EMF pollution and other ailments.



The video's show the CHI-O PHI coming from the far reaches of time and space...  delivered by a
Space Man from the future and a Galactic Goddess... as all good technology does..? Right..? 

Well actually it comes from decades of research from scientists who 
bare the brunt of criticism for studying technologies that challenge our
 existing belief patterns... It's time for change...

It IS the age of Quantum Technology.

(*Pance Datu is a combination of five metals that are considered to be sacred and are placed underneath the temples in India and Bali and blessed with special mantras to create an energy vortex upon which the temple is built. The Pance Datu Chi-Os are then blessed by a Balinese priest with the special Pance Datu ceremony before they are shipped out.)


Why is it called a Chi-O Phi?
Chi-O stands for Chi-Organizer
There are a number of ways to organize the Chi (Ki, Prana) from the ancient techniques of Qi-Gong and yoga, to walking barefoot in the forest or spending time in the ocean. However if you are not inclined to practice these techniques or are unable to make it into nature regularly due to location or lifestyle, how do you support your energy?The Chi-O Phi is design for exactly this purpose!Below is a study done with 28 people. The graph shows an average of all 
28 people's Chi Stagnation levels in different situations. First with no
 Cell phone present, next holding the Cell phone in the Right Hand 
(notice the Chi Stagnation goes up also on the left side of the body 
when holding the Cell phone) and finally wearing the Chi-O and holding 
the Cell phone in the right hand.As can 
be seen in the live blood analysis below, the Chi-O Phi shows beneficial
 effects, supporting the body to balance itself and enter a more natural
 state, almost as if the test subjects have been exposed to an EMF free 
environment.





What is the meaning of Phi?

 Phi is the most common pattern
in all of nature, pronounced Fi. It has the number starting with 1.618+ (see below
for more details). This Golden Mean ratio, as it is also known, has been used by artists, architects
and designers for millennia and typifies  the qualities of beauty and perfection.
This ratio can be recognized in much of our environment, from the famous
Fibonacci progression, Da Vinci's drawing of man, pentagrams, the water molecule and even the structure of
our DNA is profoundly based on the golden mean ratio. 
It is clear, this pattern
supports our natural harmonics, or resonance.




1/1.618 = 0.6180.618 / 1.618 = 0.3820.382 / 1.618 = 0.2360.236 / 1.618 = 0.146






How does the Chi-O Phi support me?Most man made
environments are not in resonance with nature and life. It is becoming
increasingly evident that the structures we build for ourselves to live and 
work in are not often beneficial to our health and biology. Artificial environments and the presence of other unnatural
frequencies disrupt and disorientate the body from being able to tune in with
these natural frequencies, causing a 
de-harmonizing and unbalancing of the body and its functions, creating a disruption in
our general health.Being in harmony with the natural resonance of life is the foundation
 of the design principles of the Chi-O Phi. The circuitry within the 
Chi-O is composed of a frequency generator that produces a wide range of frequencies found in the natural world, including the 
Schumann Resonance. These energy pulses are transformed into a specific 
light frequency and pattern, emanating from the internal LED that 
illuminates through the crystal gem nestled onto the front of the Chi-O 
Phi. Our body then has a frequency pattern to tune in to.Our technology also includes the scalar antenna resting within the Chi-O Phi pod. Strategically place
directly under a programmed hologram chip, it creates an Active Scalar 
field
that exalts your energy field, even if your energy levels as low. Passive
Scalar devices rely on your bio-energy to power them and work well if 
your Chi
energy is high. But if your Chi energy is low, a passive device can 
actually drain more of your Chi energy as it attempts to power itself. 
Since the Chi-O is powered via battery, it boosts your Chi even if you 
are feeling low on energy.
The pre-programmed hologram cards carry a specific IDF (Intrinsic Data Field) pattern .
This information is then ""broadcast"" into the body and the
environment to produce various supportive harmonizing effects and create a radiant
field that supports the person's system to stay in tune with the frequencies
of Nature. This reduces the negative effects of pulse digital signals (ie: mobile
phones, WiFi, smart meters) and  releases
the stagnation of Chi energy in the body, allowing us to flow with more ease in
life while we continue to live our busy lives, along with these other benefits.

Disclaimer: We are in no way conveying that this is a medical instrument permanent 
solution or that devices like this can replace the natural harmonics 
created by living in natural environments. What we feel is that we can offer is  one solution to the extreme conditions we find in the artificial
 environments we exist in, today. 
We believe that this electro-magnetic 
pollution will come into awareness of the masses and more solutions will be 
available in the future. As a result, the natural resonance of humans and 
nature will be reestablished. We understand that the problem must also be addressed at its core by becoming aware of the effects  pulsed digital devices.
That being said, we acknowledge the importance
 of technology in this moment of history. The transmission 
of information and hyper connectivity allows people to share 
globally, changes our lives by
opening our possibilities and decreases the perceived size of the world at the same time breaking down barriers between people and cultures. 
For this we are grateful! Without it, we would not be able to share like this!




We are very grateful for your interest in this project and we thank
 you for your contribution in manifesting the Chi-O Phi!
Please share this page with your friends and like the Facebook page 
to help build the awareness of EMF pollution in our environment and at least 
one solution that is already available, here and now.
If nothing else, we hope this has helped to spread the awareness of the million fold increase in Electro-Smog!
Thank you!

message on the importance and influence of EMF frequencies. To honor your 
intention to be part of this awareness your will receive a downloadable 
copy of; ""Regaining Wholeness Through the Subtle Dimensions"" -  
Don Paris Ph.D. (h.c.).  
(Valued @ $15.95)
Excerpts from the introduction to Regaining Wholeness....
Using the SE-5 1000 to analyze and balance subtle informational fields puts many dimensions literally at our fingertips that would otherwise remain at the edge of our consciousness like a dream hovering at the edge of our remembering, haunting our daily thoughts for recognition. Regaining wholeness through the use of the SE-5 1000 has become an exciting adventure that has opened many new subtle dimensions in my world.
This book is divided in two parts. The first part is written to familiarize the new-comer with the purpose and theory behind the SE-5 1000. You will find the features of the SE-5 1000 to be sometimes astounding and at other times actually hard to believe. Had I not experienced these things, I could easily think this to be a science fiction book. I can assure you, though, that this technology does exist, and I have done my best to describe the results of using this equipment in a language that is both understandable, accurate, and legal.
Part II of the book delves into actual practical applications of the SE-5 1000 with many anecdotal experiences that in older times would have been called miraculous . If ever a technology of miracles were developed, it would be the SE-5 1000.Part II will be of great benefit to those who already have an SE-5 1000, as well as to those of you who are wondering how this technology can be applied to your life. Will the next bottle of vitamins you buy be your last? 
There are many more uses for the SE-5 1000 than I could ever put into a book however, the intent of this book is to help you understand the principles by which the SE-5 1000 functions, which in turn will allow you to use your imagination and come up with other uses that have not yet been discovered. May your path be exciting and full of wondrous surprises.Don Paris Ph.D. (h.c.)

Why do we need a Chi-O?

Well, ideally we wouldn't! 
However, pulse digital signals in our environment have increased, by some reports, millions of fold in the last 20-30 years. If we think back to when we first were introduced to Motorola and the mobile phone in the 70's it was a rare device. 



Because lets face it... Who wanted to walk around with one of those in 
your back pocket?However as the technology improved and the devices became smaller and more functional, they evolved into more of a personal computer that you could take anywhere and the iPhone and Android were born!
Before we knew it, everyone needed to have a phone! 2014 figures show that there are now over 4.23 Billion telephone users, in what is also a Billion dollar industry.



What does this all mean for us?
Firstly, it means that if we are going to be able to use these phones, we need mobile towers that provide the signal for us to use our phones. These towers are permanently pulsing signals out to the ready users wanting to stay connected to the world. This is like second hand smoke, except that we can not simply step outside into the fresh air. The request for even more coverage is always present and these towers are being erected at every viable location. The range of items that we are connecting to are continuously increasing from smart meters, to smart refrigerators, ovens, washing machines and even a smart toothbrush.
There has recently been a documentary made around the increased roll out of  smart meters, discussing the range of inherent implications, called Take Back Your Power.
Some may question the authenticity of some of these claims, however, there are those who have not believed in the dangers of non-ionising EMF radiation, including Dr. Devra Davis Ph.D. PMH. She served as the President Clinton appointee to the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board from 1994 to 1999. It was under her direction that it became impossible to refuse the building of a telephone cell tower in the area based on health concerns. She has since performed a complete turn around on the issue and is now Founder and President of Environmental Health Trust Environmental Health Trust, who consistently provides cutting-edge research 
and education about cellphones and other environmental health hazards 
and promotes constructive policies locally, nationally and 
internationally, bringing you the world's top science and scientists.

It is also now acknowledged by the most recognizable of authorities, the World Health Organization as a possible carcinogen in the same class as lead and car exhaust fumes!

Gregor McNeil, Managing Director of Consumer at Virgin Media, said:
“Not only is this the first time we’ve built metropolitan WiFi 
directly from our street cabinets, it is also the UK’s first deployment 
of a WiFi connected pavement. It is literally public WiFi under your 
feet. We want to build more networks like this across the UK and 
encourage more forward thinking councils just like Chesham to get in

As for the cover up...
here is one of many cases



UW Scientist Henry Lai Makes Waves in the Cell Phone IndustryAfter Lai and Singh’s research finding an effect on DNA was published in
 1995, Lai learned of a full-scale effort to discredit his work. In an 
internal company memo leaked to Microwave News, a publication that 
examines health and environmental effects of electromagnetic radiation, 
Motorola described its plan to “war-game” and undermine Lai’s research.
 
Thus was launched an epic battle over research and truth. If Lai and 
Singh were correct about the potential impact on brain cells from 
radio-frequency radiation, there could be billions of dollars on the 
line for the cell phone industry in potential liability, leading to 
significant design changes and lost market expansion.Yet the soft-spoken scientist’s steadfast belief in that principle has 
placed his research at the center of a persistent global controversy and
 created powerful enemies that tried to get him fired and essentially 
succeeded in drying up the source of funding for the type of research he
 was doing.full article

How does the Chi-O work?

A brief history of Scalar Technology




Truly the grandfather of scalar would have to be Nicola Tesla. He didn't use the word scalar, but he created scalar fields with many of his devices to produce ""free energy"". He also invented healing devices that used scalar electro-magnetic energy and thus is known as the grandfather of Electro-Therapy.



Galen Hieronymus received a U.S. Patent for his invention in 1949, which was 
described in the patent application title as a device for ""detection of 
emanations from materials and measurement of the volumes thereof.""




The circle closes with the development of the newest and most advanced instrument coming from the USA where Radionics first began through Dr. Abrams. 
Dr. Willard Frank, Ph.D. physicist, electro-engineer and inventor developed a computerized instrument in 1986, the ‘SE-5 Intrinsic Data Field Analyzer’, and updated the instrument in 1998 later called the SE-5 plus. The SE-5 plus is not a traditional Radionics instrument. It is well known for its analyzing and balancing of Intrinsic Data Fields (IDFs). The face of Radionics has changed dramatically as the understanding of this phenomena is embraced. The SE-5 plus is not used in the traditional sense of medicine, and the gap is ever widening. Since this instrument is so versatile, it is now used in mining, agriculture, business, with new areas of use opening every day.As with the instruments of de la Warr, Drown and Hieronymus instruments, the SE-5 plus uses a ‘stick plate’ as a detector. This is not the usual rubber membrane, but a thin piece of circuit board material over geometric designs, and scalar antennas underneath which fine tune and amplify the scalar informational fields, IDFs.Through the use of the computer, dials are used to dial in the ‘Tunings’ but rather one can easily type them into the small pocket computer on the instrument.

Working with the much simpler analysis method, the time to find the ‘Tunings’ is greatly reduced. The number of usable ‘Tunings’ has now reached over 17,000.After the death of Dr. Frank in 2008, Don Paris Ph.D.(h.c.) redesigned the SE-5 plus and updated it to work with today’s computers. The SE-5 1000 added many new features such as an automatic Replicator, Infra Red Scanning Probe, Electro-luminescent Output cable, Color Light Harmonizer and much more.

An expansive history scalar technology is described in my book, ""Regaining Wholeness
 Through the Subtle Dimensions"", available to all contributors.


The subject of Scalar and IDFs (Intrinsic Data Fields) is outlined in
 my book Regaining Wholeness Through the Subtle Dimensions. (Which you 
get as a perk for even a $1 donation to our Indiegogo program of the 
Chi-O Phi. And Yes, IDFs is a coined phrase to describe something that 
has proven a thousand times over in the field of Radionics over the last
 100 years. 
 The difficulty with the field of Scalar is that many
 people have picked it up as a catch word to sell everything. The other 
problem is that those that actually understand this type of 
eletro-magnetic phenomena are either in black op programs with high 
security restrictions or are underfunded inventors working in their 
garage. 
 Finding reliable information about this field is 
difficult, even with the internet, because of the confusion of the Information aspect of Scalar and the Electro-magnetic aspect. I was 
fortunate to have become best friends with several people that have 
actually researched and experimented in this field. Dr. Robert C. Beck 
created a small scalar device that he used to get a signal out of a 
""quiet room"" many stories underground in a military installation. Bob 
was a very close friend and taught me a lot about the Electro-magnetic 
aspects of Scalar. 
 Eldon Byrd worked in a military program to 
develop Scalar weaponry for about 20 years. He was also a very close 
friend of both Bob Beck and myself. The concepts of using scalar as 
weapons is not a concept. They developed ""terrible"" devices and weapons.
 His greatest experience was the day that Clinton became president and 
they shut down the program and destroyed the research. 
 Dr. 
Willard Frank AKA William Francis Lawson, was actually the inventor of 
the Chi-O. As I describe in the history video, it was originally called 
the Scalar Plus. His work with Galen Hieronymus and his development of 
the SE-5 is legendary. Bill was a Ph.D. physicist. Bill was also a close
 friend of both Bob Beck and Eldon Byrd. I worked very closely with Bill for more 
than 20 years. 
 As far as programming the hologram 
chips is concerned, I teach this in my DVD course, The Next Dimension, 
and describes step by step how to do this.  www.se-5.com/advanced.htm 

 There have been double blind, placebo studies done with ""programmed"" 
holograms. I show some in my history video. So as far as woo is 
concerned, I agree, this is very much in the woo area because it is way

And super practical! Here it is: the new Octopus noseclip! 

Made with top-quality materials and finish, its ergonomic shape and anti-slippery silicone pads ensure a tight grip and no leaks, for perfect equalization. Check out the video above for a preview of the product! I am a freediver competitor and instructor, but I have also been working as product designer for many years. This makes me not only aware of what freedivers need and want in a good noseclip, but also able to create and design a product that will meet these needs. Being from Switzerland, it is in my genes to care about precision, quality and attention to detail, and I will make sure I personally check and supervise the whole manufacturing process step by step in Switzerland, to offer you a final product of the best quality possible. Be the first to order your new Octopus noseclip, at a great discovery price!!! Delivery will be in September-October this year at the latest. All monies received from your pre-orders will be used to cover part of the production costs, estimated at 15'000$. In order to get high quality plastic parts, we use a process called ""plastic injection"", requiring complex moulds that will fit in a huge industrial injection machine. These cost a lot: around 10'000$ for the hard plastic parts and 3000$ for the silicone ones. Of course I could have it all made in China for half the price, but I like to support the local craftsmen and entrepreneurs! If you cannot support me financially, you can still help me and my project by sharing this on facebook or by email with your freediver friends and by simply talking about my noseclip around you!Huge thanks for your support!!!See you in the blue!Pascal",3.0,0,"7 Campaigns

<h3>Who am I and what is a DOPEFULLY?</h3>
</center>
<p>My name is <em>Corey Fields</em> (sometimes Corey F. Godwell, a creative pseudonym that stuck) and I am a New York City native. I am a professional Graphic Designer/Illustrator and co-creator of Nukleus Comics. I always signed into the athstetic of ""if you want better, contribute and make it better"". When I was 19, I was far more proactive when I joined a youth organization in Brooklyn that strived for racial equality. Since those days, after two decades and plenty of growth, I settled into the world of adulthood and life changes that accompany it. Naturally, my proactive roll diminished and I just started feeling complacent. Then, along came social networking. Started talking to and bonding with a few good people, information was exchanged and some pretty heavy information shared. <br/><br/>I'm one of those Facebook, Twitter and Huffington Post loudmouths that loves to share the latest information on anything from an increasingly irrelevant Supreme Court to Congress to Monsanto to Climate Change, Droning, Fracking...""anything but personal crap"" is how I do it. A self described ""sh*t checker"" with a low tolerance for foolishness and while it can be said ""I'm all over the place"" I remain focused on doing something MORE. Simply put...I'm tired of just talking. Its time to go back into the 'good fight' and I am dragging a few good people in to help the cause. <strong>Dopefully is a responsible UNISEX</strong> <strong>brand</strong>.<br/><br/>Took a word that a wonderful friend of mine used on her day to day, which employed <strong>""Dope""</strong> (an old eighties slang definition of ""great"" of ""hot"") and <strong>""hopefully""</strong>, as if to say <em>""stay optimistic""</em>. She let me borrow it and the color coding is slightly based on a beautiful watch campaign I actually came across on Indiegogo itself. I then took to putting some meaningful designs together and consulting with a few friends I know, who are either in the creative industry or who shared the concerns displayed in the actual artwork. Take all of those ingredients, add a proactive itch, a little water, stir and...</p>

<center>
<h3>COLOR CODE to CAUSE.</h3>
</center>
<p>I have been tossing this around and around in my head for some time and lets face it, its not a reinvention of the wheel, but I realized that it already had a niche before it all took shape. I decided to make it special by using designs that not only speak to the buyer, but that spoke for something. The color code chart [above] is running on a method of color-by-association (i.e., <strong>Green=Environmental, Pink=Breast Cancer Awareness, Blue=Seal Life causes/Water causes, Anti-Fracking, etc...</strong>), at least for the duration of this campaign. It will later be expanded to associate with the primary color on the shirt as well. These organizations that are out there doing the groundwork. The science to keeping any well oiled machine running. This is the story of my venture and you are witnessing its evolution.<br/><br/></p>
<center>
<h3>PHILANTHROPY + DESIGN.</h3>
</center>
<p>Unfortunately, the politics of the nation (at least in America) is being fought via financing. Its a new reality. I don't particularly like it, but it is the 'Newest Deal', for now. Raised leaning Left, but recognizing the need for a Right, I decided to dodge the political bullet (more or less FOR NOW) and just contribute <em><strong>$5 PER SHIRT</strong></em> to some core fights that (I personally felt) need to be fought for and by all. Health, Cancer, Diet, Environment and the most invaluable resource of them all...our Children. Without getting into a full on debate, there is no doubt that education, child labor laws, mentoring, the battle for labeled Genetically Modified Foods (GMO's), Cancer (especially amongst women), etc...these are some critical issues of our time. You can't ignore them and this is my little way of deciding to do something, while getting others involved at the same time. This is the way we humans do it...we help each other. That simple. I'm going to see that this one voice, this brand, that it speaks loudly and that it is heard.</p>
<em><strong>Quality is not an option</strong></em>. This is not a situation where your money will not be well spent, both by the donation, but also by design. This is a T-Shirt brand. Period. What we are doing is conducting business, but also being responsible by donating a sizable portion of the profits. All of our shirts are:<br/><ul>
<li>100% Cotton or Hemp fabrics.</li>
<li>Fitted tees with two STANDARD CUT sizes available.</li>
<li>We print with discharge inks, which soak into the fabric for a natural feel.</li>
<li>Tagless. We print the wash instruction inside the neck of the shirt.</li>
<li>Most of our shirts are European cut and fitted. Although, we will have an optional STANDARD cut T available.</li>
<li>All hang tags and packaging will be 100% recyclable.<br/><br/>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</center>
<p><em><strong>We decided to shoot for $9000</strong></em> because the ultimate goal is to launch the brand with a total of 14 shirts, if not a few more, provided we surpass the intended goal. New designs will be added as we can cover the cost. We set our first shipping date a few weeks out. This allows for a realistic production prep time and to give all contributors time to change their selection, should we expand the line, which is the intent. In coming weeks you will see MORE original hand drawn artwork,<strong> you will see more grassroot and local causes </strong>as well shirts dedicated to <strong>Anti-Bullying</strong>, <strong>Violence Against Women</strong>, the fight to stop the <strong>Keystone Pipeline</strong>, more international causes such as a tee that will contribute to <strong>supplying mosquito nets</strong> to children in parts of Africa, another shirt dedicated to the UK Parliaments <strong>austerity attack</strong> on the sick and the elderly, Anti-Austerity, dietary causes like the passing of legislature to <strong>label GMO's,</strong> <strong>anti-Monsanto</strong> shirts and plenty more. Some will call us ""self-righteous"" and guess what? I'll wear that, proudly. Although, I don't necessarily agree. This is not going to be a ""throw money at it"" situation either, but money talks. Lets be realistic. When you actually have something to say? Even better. <br/><br/><em><strong>The initial campaign ceiling will cover the cost of:</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li>The shirts themselves, which are a 100% cotton (or Hemp, in some cases) garment. </li>
<li>The campaign video/commercial (which should be in place by 16th of March) plus photos.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The cost of screens (PER COLOR for each design, not per design) which runs a one time rate of $30 each</li>
<li>The print fee, inner-neck tag print, both done in discharge inks, which actually are bleached into the fabric, creating a natural feel, as opposed to a thick plastic plastisol print.</li>
<li>A nifty recyclable hang-tag with background info of the company itself</li>
<li>Postcards (which will be available shortly as as we can pay for them) and included with each Perk</li>
<li>Shipping, which will kind of sort of be ""FREE"" for all contributors. Unless of course, you are outside of the United States.</li>
<li>Hooded sweatshirts made of 100%</li>
</ul>
<em><strong>Should we not reach the intended goal</strong></em>, we will scale back on the amount of designs available, instead of scaling back on quality. As stated before, quality is not an option. People are donating from their pockets. The lease we can do is make sure you receive a quality garment. <em><strong>Should we surpass the intended numbers</strong></em>, then we will carefully expand and include accessories and items such as carved natural soaps, more hoodies and even hire additional artists to add artistic variety and fresh concepts. Manufacturing of the actual garment is also in the works, although we are taking the measures to make sure <em><strong>we do not use sweatshop garments.</strong></em><br/><br/>All of our <strong>perks</strong> will range from a complimentary postcard that will feature full color artwork of 3 (or more, depending on how close we come to our goal) of the designs above and can either be a collectors item or used as a gift to send a powerful message to a loved one. The higher contributions will see perks such as the <strong>The Philanthropist Special</strong> which features 4 T-shirts of your choosing, a hoodie version of any of the 14 designs, all three postcards and a sincere THANK YOU for your hard earned contribution. All contributors names will be added to the <em>Dope List</em> of monthly contributors (unless you opt out) in the upcoming <strong>Dopefully Blog</strong>, debuting on March 30th.

<p>We operate on the <strong>""village to raise a child""</strong> theory. The mindset of ""one hand washes the other"".

</div></span></div>","Who am I and what is a DOPEFULLY?

My name is Corey Fields (sometimes Corey F. Godwell, a creative pseudonym that stuck) and I am a New York City native. I am a professional Graphic Designer/Illustrator and co-creator of Nukleus Comics. I always signed into the athstetic of ""if you want better, contribute and make it better"". When I was 19, I was far more proactive when I joined a youth organization in Brooklyn that strived for racial equality. Since those days, after two decades and plenty of growth, I settled into the world of adulthood and life changes that accompany it. Naturally, my proactive roll diminished and I just started feeling complacent. Then, along came social networking. Started talking to and bonding with a few good people, information was exchanged and some pretty heavy information shared. I'm one of those Facebook, Twitter and Huffington Post loudmouths that loves to share the latest information on anything from an increasingly irrelevant Supreme Court to Congress to Monsanto to Climate Change, Droning, Fracking...""anything but personal crap"" is how I do it. A self described ""sh*t checker"" with a low tolerance for foolishness and while it can be said ""I'm all over the place"" I remain focused on doing something MORE. Simply put...I'm tired of just talking. Its time to go back into the 'good fight' and I am dragging a few good people in to help the cause. Dopefully is a responsible UNISEX brand.Took a word that a wonderful friend of mine used on her day to day, which employed ""Dope"" (an old eighties slang definition of ""great"" of ""hot"") and ""hopefully"", as if to say ""stay optimistic"". She let me borrow it and the color coding is slightly based on a beautiful watch campaign I actually came across on Indiegogo itself. I then took to putting some meaningful designs together and consulting with a few friends I know, who are either in the creative industry or who shared the concerns displayed in the actual artwork. Take all of those ingredients, add a proactive itch, a little water, stir and...


COLOR CODE to CAUSE.

I have been tossing this around and around in my head for some time and lets face it, its not a reinvention of the wheel, but I realized that it already had a niche before it all took shape. I decided to make it special by using designs that not only speak to the buyer, but that spoke for something. The color code chart [above] is running on a method of color-by-association (i.e., Green=Environmental, Pink=Breast Cancer Awareness, Blue=Seal Life causes/Water causes, Anti-Fracking, etc...), at least for the duration of this campaign. It will later be expanded to associate with the primary color on the shirt as well. These organizations that are out there doing the groundwork. The science to keeping any well oiled machine running. This is the story of my venture and you are witnessing its evolution.

PHILANTHROPY + DESIGN.

Unfortunately, the politics of the nation (at least in America) is being fought via financing. Its a new reality. I don't particularly like it, but it is the 'Newest Deal', for now. Raised leaning Left, but recognizing the need for a Right, I decided to dodge the political bullet (more or less FOR NOW) and just contribute $5 PER SHIRT to some core fights that (I personally felt) need to be fought for and by all. Health, Cancer, Diet, Environment and the most invaluable resource of them all...our Children. Without getting into a full on debate, there is no doubt that education, child labor laws, mentoring, the battle for labeled Genetically Modified Foods (GMO's), Cancer (especially amongst women), etc...these are some critical issues of our time. You can't ignore them and this is my little way of deciding to do something, while getting others involved at the same time. This is the way we humans do it...we help each other. That simple. I'm going to see that this one voice, this brand, that it speaks loudly and that it is heard.
Quality is not an option. This is not a situation where your money will not be well spent, both by the donation, but also by design. This is a T-Shirt brand. Period. What we are doing is conducting business, but also being responsible by donating a sizable portion of the profits. All of our shirts are:
100% Cotton or Hemp fabrics.
Fitted tees with two STANDARD CUT sizes available.
We print with discharge inks, which soak into the fabric for a natural feel.
Tagless. We print the wash instruction inside the neck of the shirt.
Most of our shirts are European cut and fitted. Although, we will have an optional STANDARD cut T available.
All hang tags and packaging will be 100% recyclable.

<h2>TABLE DESIGNS</h2>
<p>Normally, table designs don't excite people...But that's about to change!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Granny's On Fire!!!  <span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">========================</span>
</h3>
<p>My name is Evelyn Spooner, and I've been a designer my entire life. Decorating (and re-decorating) my dollhouses is one of the earliest memories I have. That soon turned into sewing all the dolls' clothes and household accessories, and finally evolved into doing the same for real-life people.</p>
<p>I had a pretty meager upbringing, so for many, many years, I took in sewing to make ends meet, even later if I was ever in between a ""real"" job. Secretly, I always longed to be able to exercise my sewing talents full-time and for pay, instead of the mundane jobs that stopped me from doing what I loved most, designing and sewing!</p>
<p>Late in life, I finally got the courage to formalize my talent, so I went back to school to obtain my degree in Fashion Design. I can (and do) design just about anything I get my hands on!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How it all started  <span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">==========================</span>
</h3>
<p><img alt=""Matooga Lunch mats"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://app6.websitetonight.com/projects2/6/3/7/6/2916736/images/1c5c1e29abf02e7e41d6588458050af7.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Matooga Lunch Mats""/></p>
<p>I began designing and creating eco-friendly lunch mats at the request of my grandchildren (and very soon, all their friends) and demand swiftly grew faster than I ever imagined.</p>
<p>The fun mats make kids feel special, and Moms love the functionality, convenient pockets, eco-friendliness, compactness, and comfort of knowing that their kids' lunch surface will be clean. It didn't take long to turn the popularity of the kids (and then adult) lunch mats into a successful business!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<br/>What all the NEW fuss is about...  <span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">=================</span>
</h3>
<p>And now, I'm thrilled to be developing a brand new, never-before-seen table design that I call: Table Mats!</p>
<p><img alt=""Matooga Table Mats"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://app6.websitetonight.com/projects2/6/3/7/6/2916736/images/0882747d97649c599074ae86ee78911c.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Matooga Table Mats""/></p>
<p>Table mats are a cross between a runner and a placemat...they are (typically) square or round mats that sit as a large center mat in the middle of a table. They can add style and elegance to a table, be used as coverage for family style meals, as a backdrop for centerpieces, and tons of other uses!</p>
<p>I've distributed prototypes and samples to friends, family, and our ""sneak peak"" customers and they can not get enough! The mats are so versatile and multi-purpose, they're using them for things I've never even thought of! They've been even more well-received than our lunch mats, which says A LOT!</p>
<p>The design possibilities for these table mats are endless, and I'm super EXCITED about where I can take this!!!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>
<br/>About Your contributions   <span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">====================</span>

<p> </p></div>","TABLE DESIGNS
Normally, table designs don't excite people...But that's about to change!
 
Granny's On Fire!!!  ========================

My name is Evelyn Spooner, and I've been a designer my entire life. Decorating (and re-decorating) my dollhouses is one of the earliest memories I have. That soon turned into sewing all the dolls' clothes and household accessories, and finally evolved into doing the same for real-life people.
I had a pretty meager upbringing, so for many, many years, I took in sewing to make ends meet, even later if I was ever in between a ""real"" job. Secretly, I always longed to be able to exercise my sewing talents full-time and for pay, instead of the mundane jobs that stopped me from doing what I loved most, designing and sewing!
Late in life, I finally got the courage to formalize my talent, so I went back to school to obtain my degree in Fashion Design. I can (and do) design just about anything I get my hands on!
 
How it all started  ==========================


I began designing and creating eco-friendly lunch mats at the request of my grandchildren (and very soon, all their friends) and demand swiftly grew faster than I ever imagined.
The fun mats make kids feel special, and Moms love the functionality, convenient pockets, eco-friendliness, compactness, and comfort of knowing that their kids' lunch surface will be clean. It didn't take long to turn the popularity of the kids (and then adult) lunch mats into a successful business!
 

What all the NEW fuss is about...  =================

And now, I'm thrilled to be developing a brand new, never-before-seen table design that I call: Table Mats!

Table mats are a cross between a runner and a placemat...they are (typically) square or round mats that sit as a large center mat in the middle of a table. They can add style and elegance to a table, be used as coverage for family style meals, as a backdrop for centerpieces, and tons of other uses!
I've distributed prototypes and samples to friends, family, and our ""sneak peak"" customers and they can not get enough! The mats are so versatile and multi-purpose, they're using them for things I've never even thought of! They've been even more well-received than our lunch mats, which says A LOT!
The design possibilities for these table mats are endless, and I'm super EXCITED about where I can take this!!!
 

About Your contributions   ====================

Your generous contributions will allow me to bring table mats to the world THE RIGHT WAY, introducing the line with the variety of styles and flare that the mats beg for. You'll help allow me to flex my true creative designing wings rather than my creativity being limited by finances. I'll create extremely unique designs that span the casual to elegent to bizarre! Upon launch, I want you to say ""WOW, I've gotta get me one of those!"", and I thank you for helping me make that happen!
Here's how I will maximize your contributions to make this launch a success:
Fabric, decorations & trim inventory - ($1,500)
Specialized Industrial Sewing Equipment * Industrial Sewing Machine $ Fix ($1,250) * Overlock Sewing Machine ($300) * Embroidery Machine ($600)

Services * Contract Sewing Assistants/seamstresses (based on volume) ($1,240) * Website/Graphic Design costs ($275)
Miscellaneous and overhead ($550)

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>HEY SACRED HEARTS!! </p>
<p>Welcome to my fund raising page!!!  I'm so excited and humbled by the fact that you're even on here to see what’s NEXT for It’s S.A.C.R.E.D. and you desire to LOVE on and sow into it!! </p>
<p>It has been a LONG road preparing for the next collection. There have been tears, delays, and a whole lot of praying yet the time has come. IN HIM is so fitting for this collection because my team and I truly had to STAY in Him. </p>
<p>The concepts have been designed, proofed, and completed. The materials meaning BETTER t-shirts have been found, the printers, photographers, and ALL that it takes to put out another LOVE Tee collection are ready to go for such a time as this. </p>
<p>That’s where I need YOUR help!!! I have gotten all the raw materials together now it’s time to produce the LOVE Tees. I truly appreciate your help in the PRODUCTION for this collection!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise at least $2700 for production.  What will this money cover you ask? </p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase &amp; Printing of Shirts</li>
<li>Private Labeling</li>
<li>Photo shoot for website and marketing materials</li>
<li>In Him Collection Sacred Sound Off’s</li>
<li>Miscellaneous expenses toward a successful collection.</li>
</ul>
<p>In return for your LOVE sown, we have listed different LOVE perks (to your right) that you'll receive at different levels!!! Your LOVE comes full circle from us back to YOU!!  </p>
<p>Now, if for some reason we don't reach our goal of $2700, we will use what we have to do as much as we can.  If we go beyond our $2700 (JESUS IS REAL!!) all monies will still be used toward the ministry of It’s S.A.C.R.E.D. Lifestyle Brand and other materials needed for the ministry. So either way, your financial contribution will be going toward ALL things S.A.C.R.E.D.!!</p>
</div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>My prayer is that the IN HIM Love Tee collection will be the moving ministry and feet to what it truly means to be IN CHRIST and to walk in LOVE. Every time an eye lays on a shirt it’s another opportunity to minister if approached or be a light in this world without saying a word. </p>
<p>The It’s S.A.C.R.E.D. Love Tees are more than t-shirts. They are moving ministry! They are a lifestyle! They are Love in motion! They are S.A.C.R.E.D. (Sound. Anointed. Covenant. Representation. Engaged. Devotion.)!</p>
<p>So your help and LOVE with this will help me reach many Sacred Sirens and Sacred Soldiers, especially those who desire to be a part of the Sacred StreetHeart team and help restore the divine purpose of marriage and families that impact the world by putting on LOVE-HIS love with a LOVE Tee.</p>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I certainly know that some people just can’t show LOVE with money, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help!  Here are some other ways you can show LOVE and sow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pray!! Pray again!! Pray for the Father, Son, and the Holy Spirit!!! The bible says in 1 Thessalonians 5:17, ""Pray without ceasing"".  So please pray that God would allow the ministry of Sacred Enterprises Inc &amp; It’s S.A.C.R.E.D. Lifestyle Brand to do the work that He has called it to do.</li>
<li>Spread the Word!  Tweet, Facebook, Email...whatever means you can use to  please tell ALL the Sacred Hearts you know and that they may know so we can exceed beyond what this ministry could ever ask or think!!</li>
<li>Words of Encouragement! Please connect with me on FB, Twitter, or/and when you see me and show LOVE.  Pursuing a God-sized vision can be a lonely journey. Looking beyond what you see in the natural isn't always easy. Any LOVE sown towards my way would mean more than the world to me!!</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks in advance for your LOVE and support of this collection, Sacred Enterprises Inc, and It's S.A.C.R.E.D. Lifestyle Brand! </p>

<h1><strong>We Need Your Support</strong></h1>

<p>We have big dreams and are reaching out for your support in hopes that our vision resonates with you. We would love for you to be one of the first to wear our beautiful watches. This is only one of our designs and we have many more that we would love to produce; the more we raise, the more we can do!</p>
<p>We want to thank you from the bottom of our hearts for taking the time to get to know us and our vision and for your support big and small.</p>

We are Mr & Mrs Cottrell: a fortunate couple that not only shares a love for each other but also a love for fashion and design.
Passionate about the finer things: we are equally passionate about expressing ones self through fashion.

Our time pieces embody unpretentious sophistication and will be a beautiful addition to your wardrobe. Inspired by vintage designs with a modern twist we feel that these timeless pieces will reflect those with kindred spirits.

</p><p><b>About
NGD</b></p>
<p>NGD Clothing is a street and urban clothing brand that aims
to give people a sense of style and confidence with the clothing they wear. NGD
designs artistic clothing that men and women can wear. The stylish clothing
also shares a vision and spreads a positive message. Inspired and motivated by
hip hop and street art, NGD pushes forward to become known in the fashion
world. We want people to realize who we are, but also see that we are not just
a clothing line that creates basic and un-inspirational clothing. We want
consumers to realize that as a clothing line we have something to offer to
people; no matter who you are, where you're from our how you grew up, any dream
can become a reality. NGD wants to serve as a testimony that it is OK to use
what inspires you as a person as a foundation to push you forward towards a
brighter future.</p>

<b>What
Makes NGD Different?</b><br/>
Each of our shirts has a message about who NGD is and what we stand for. We are
not just a clothing line that is just looking to sell product. Instead, we want
people to see our struggle and realize that we are portraying a positive
message through our clothing and our artistic design. What is that message,
might you ask? To keep dreaming and believing. As youth, we often have great
dreams and aspirations that grow beautifully like wild flowers, but as we grow
up, we loose a grip on those dreams and weed-like thoughts of failure and
mediocrity grow in our minds. Eventually, the wild and beautiful dreams we had
as children die off and we start to embrace the life we never wanted to live. <br/>
We show messages on our shirts to express that dreams are forever with us. Our
clothing is meant to be heard as well as seen. Above all, NGD wants the youth
to remember that no matter what, keep working and keep dreaming and never let
that dream go. NGD aims to motivate and inspire others through each piece of
clothing that is made.  NGD serves as an example that through hard work,
dedication, and perseverance anything can be done. <p></p><p><b>Run The City - (Tank Top)</b><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/304352/files/20140112104024-img_3258.jpg?1389552024"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Look I'm Fresh - (Tank Top)</b><br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/304354/files/20140112104140-img_3333.jpg?1389552100"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b>Kicks Stay Fresh - (T-Shirt)</b><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/304358/files/20140112104307-img_3317.jpg?1389552187"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>

The Bomber Barrel redefines style by presenting itself in a modern and simple barrel structure: pure, austere and clean. The Bomber Barrel is an ultra grade nylon duffel bag designed for you - the athlete, the adventurer, the professional, and the minimalist. It was created to accommodate the lifestyles of the ambitious, the motivated and the driven. With its minimal design, lightweight and black-colored nylon ripstop; its versatility is endless. Its black color creates depth and radiates its bearer’s extravagant elegance.




The Bomber Barrel was conceived out of necessity. We wanted to create a timeless duffel bag design that could be used by anyone, all the time, and be an essential item to take with you to the office, gym, on hikes, and in all of your adventures.
We want Bomber Barrel not to only be used for its functionality, but to match your personal style and be perfect for any occasion.

I admired the strength, persistence and determination these fighters had to get to the top of their game, and what being ""unbeatable"" would mean to them. Over the past few years, I have had the pleasure of meeting more and more people who have overcome greater odds by defeating cancer, some who are still fighting, and some who have yet to start the fight or may just be supporting someone who is. I believe that the spirit of these individuals truly embody what being unbeatable is all about. </span></p><p>So with that in mind, the sole mission of Unbeatable Concepts is to inspire that feeling in people around the world and give back to the causes that inspire that feeling in us. A dollar from every unbeatable apparel item sold will be donated to the corresponding cause of the awareness ribbon you choose. When you order your unbeatable apparel you will be able to specify what cause your ribbon represents.</p><p>Unbeatable Concepts has a full line of apparel for men and women, from 
adult to youth, all the way to infant. Featured apparel will include 
hats, t-shirts, fleece, shorts and even bathing suits.</p><p>Our hope is that with the contributions from our proceeds to various 
charities and research facilities we will effectively end the battle 
with cancer. So let's get it started!<br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Where will your contributions go?</h3><p>Unbeatable Concepts chose indiegogo as a platform to acknowledge and inform millions of survivors and their supporters, and to enlist the help of those who care and give. Your contributions will be rewarded with different ""perks"" having the ""unbeatable"" logo on them, including stickers and apparel. Keep in mind that the greatest part of any perk is knowing that you helped start a movement, an affirmation of belief. A select few contributors will be able to pay tribute to the person who inspired their contribution in a very special manner. (See the ""Tribute"" perk)</p><p>Our goal of $25,000 will help us get started in many ways, including our first wave of donation apparel and the formation of a mobile team to distribute it to children's hospitals and sponsorship events.</p><p>If we do not meet our campaign goal, all is not lost. We will just have to do things on a smaller scale. However, let's surpass our intended goal and take smiles and inspiration to even more people than we thought possible!</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Above and Beyond</h3><p>Unbeatable Concepts is just getting started locally, but we anticipate great growth and global expansion in 2014.</p><p>We are working locally to establish a blueprint for annual sponsorship events including walks, bike-a-thons, concerts and other original fundraising activities.

I admired the strength, persistence and determination these fighters had to get to the top of their game, and what being ""unbeatable"" would mean to them. Over the past few years, I have had the pleasure of meeting more and more people who have overcome greater odds by defeating cancer, some who are still fighting, and some who have yet to start the fight or may just be supporting someone who is. I believe that the spirit of these individuals truly embody what being unbeatable is all about. So with that in mind, the sole mission of Unbeatable Concepts is to inspire that feeling in people around the world and give back to the causes that inspire that feeling in us. A dollar from every unbeatable apparel item sold will be donated to the corresponding cause of the awareness ribbon you choose. When you order your unbeatable apparel you will be able to specify what cause your ribbon represents.Unbeatable Concepts has a full line of apparel for men and women, from 
adult to youth, all the way to infant. Featured apparel will include 
hats, t-shirts, fleece, shorts and even bathing suits.Our hope is that with the contributions from our proceeds to various 
charities and research facilities we will effectively end the battle 
with cancer. So let's get it started!Where will your contributions go?Unbeatable Concepts chose indiegogo as a platform to acknowledge and inform millions of survivors and their supporters, and to enlist the help of those who care and give. Your contributions will be rewarded with different ""perks"" having the ""unbeatable"" logo on them, including stickers and apparel. Keep in mind that the greatest part of any perk is knowing that you helped start a movement, an affirmation of belief. A select few contributors will be able to pay tribute to the person who inspired their contribution in a very special manner. (See the ""Tribute"" perk)Our goal of $25,000 will help us get started in many ways, including our first wave of donation apparel and the formation of a mobile team to distribute it to children's hospitals and sponsorship events.If we do not meet our campaign goal, all is not lost. We will just have to do things on a smaller scale. However, let's surpass our intended goal and take smiles and inspiration to even more people than we thought possible!Above and BeyondUnbeatable Concepts is just getting started locally, but we anticipate great growth and global expansion in 2014.We are working locally to establish a blueprint for annual sponsorship events including walks, bike-a-thons, concerts and other original fundraising activities. Moving forward, our website won't just be a place to purchase apparel. It will be a home for inspiration stories, updates on Unbeatable Concepts' contributions to charity, a place to suggest lesser known causes, and a fundraising calendar so you can know in advance what's happening each month. It's all about creating a caring movement When you do good...you feel good!! We believe everyone wants to be a part of something positive. If now is not a good time to contribute $$, then help be a part of the movement. Help us spread the message in your social media circles.

<p>Many of you know, small pets tend to get motion sickness and anxiety in the car. Juls Bindi started to develop ZuGoPet products in 2009 when she began traveling with her dog, Russell. Like many small dogs, Russell was suffering from severe travel anxiety, which made air travel or even short trips in the car a stressful experience. After an extensive search, Juls found there were no products on the market to alleviate his travel anxiety. Juls subsequently began the mission to create innovative pet products that show signs of significantly declining pet and peoples anxiety, by providing a comfortable and secure atmosphere while they travel together, at the same time increase safely and convenience in one airplane-compliant but high fashion product. </p>
<p>In 2012, after four years of dedicated research, safety tests, design and prototype development, ZuGoPet was launched with their first pet bag product. </p>
<p>ZuGoPet is dedicated to continue developing innovative products to help pets and your needs in the future. Help us bring convenience to your home or where ever you go. </p>

<p>My name is Dawn
Michelle Russell. I recently graduated university with a communications degree.
I recognized an obstacle in my confidence as a professional woman. I can’t keep
my pants up. I’m a curvy woman and so when I shop for pants, nothing seems to fit
right for very long. I end up losing my pants and when I ‘fix’ it with a belt I
end up with an unsightly muffin-top. I created this new product so that I have
the confidence in any situation that I won’t have to grab my waistband and reef
it up over my butt or to hide my exposed belly. </p>
<p>This product allows
curvy women everywhere the opportunity to wear pants, tights, pantyhose or
exercise gear without the fear of our dignity being lost along with our pants. </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>I am looking for $10,000
to finish development and then produce 2500 complete Grande Garter Collection
sets. These sets will be used for samples for possible large scale production
or licensing of the product. This overall cost will include my time and travel
to present this product. I will also include complete kits as perks for my
funders.</p>
<p><b>The impact</b></p>
<p>As a woman, a lot
hinges on what we wear and how we are wearing it. I know we can be our own
worst enemy but what is more important is how we feel about ourselves when we
are out. If we feel confident at work or out in our community, the decisions we
make will be different than if we feel like our butts are hanging out of our
pants. We also spend way too much and waste clothes when we don’t think they
fit right or won’t stay up. This will help women who are pregnant or women who
are in transition and are losing weight but don’t have the money to get a whole
new wardrobe.</p>
<p>The difficulty this
project has is getting the word out to women that they have options for solving
some of their most difficult fashion challenges. As a communications specialist
I know I can target the right clients and producers for this product. Also, as
a curvy woman, I know and fully understand the hardship of keeping up my
self-esteem and dignity at the same time. The other challenge I will have is finding a production facility to keep the price down for the first set of 2500. I have a large social network and so this may be easily overcome after the launch.</p>

</div></div>","Anybody who has ever used a smartphone or worn glasses knows that our fingers leave greasy smudges every time we touch a screen or lens.  A Genius Tee allows users to bring their gadgets and lenses back to crystal clear definition anywhere they go with just a few swipes. Most people just use the bottom of their shirt to clean their phone or glasses, but that just pushes the grease around.  With our three designs, you can have access to professional quality microfiber cleaning cloths anywhere and anytime.  All designs are patent pending.

The Genius Patch is a large triangle of microfiber that provides a striking look to the traditional T-shirt.  Large enough to clean an iPad in just a few swipes, the Genius Patch is a great option for cleaning anything from glasses to camera lenses.
Whether you're texting a friend or flying a drone, a Genius Patch T-shirt can help keep your screen smudge free and keep you looking good at the same time.


The Genius Patch can be ordered on either the left or right side of the shirt.


A microfiber T-Shirt pocket with a sewn in microfiber flap that can be extended for use on glasses and the folded in to look like a pocket square when not in use.  





A dapper accessory for your favorite pair of sunglasses, the Genius Pocket will let you see the world in fantastic clarity.
Use the outside of the pocket for your phone, and the inside flap for your glasses.  
A small strip of microfiber, sewn at the top and bottom but loose in the middle, the Genius Loop is designed to to allow users  to clean their phone screen as it is put in to the pants pocket.   Equally great for glasses, the Loop can be easily pulled out to wrap around a lens.






This discrete design is great for the person who wants the convenience of microfiber on their shirt but doesn't want to call attention to it.  Available with the loop on either the right or left side of the shirt.  
 




Microfiber is the most efficient cleaning cloth on the market.  It is made with incredibly small fibers that are tightly woven together so as to create a large surface area. This allows microfiber to absorb greater amounts of contaminants such as grease and dirt from a phone screen or lens.  



Genius Tees are made with the only the highest quality nylon microfiber that is specifically designed for cleaning grease off of glass surfaces.  Our microfiber is incredibly durable, has a silky feel, and is the same kind used by professional photographers.




Our T-shirts are soft to the touch, have a relaxed style, and look great loose or fitted.  They are available in both men's and women's styles and made with a Tri-blend of 50% Polyester, 25% Rayon, and 25% Cotton.  
Genius Tees are machine washable, however, to ensure the longest life of the microfiber cloth, it is recommended to wash with minimal detergent and machine dry on low heat.



$15,000 is what we need to get out our first designs, however we have a 
lot more ideas for how to grow the product and if our goals are 
surpassed we'd be excited to give them to you.  




Look forward to more 
T-shirt color options, pattern designs for the pocket, and a long sleeve
 shirt with the cuffs made of microfiber.

<h3>6-20 Update - Project Funding Successful! New Goal!</h3>
<p>The Lil Boo Doll campaign is a success, thanks to you!  We are going to raise the bar to $5,000!!!  The new project goal is to fund the offical Lil Boo Mascot for Elementary School functions and other events!  With your support we can make that possible. Be sure to check out the amazing perks we have listed including all the photos of Lil Boo in the Gallery!! Pass the word along to family and friends, through social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and G+.</p>
<p>Thank you again for supporting the Daddy Bookins brand!</p>
<p>Peas Out!<br/>~Daddy Bookins (Cameron)</p>
<h3>The Daddy Bookins Story</h3>
<p>Daddy Bookins is my pen name.  It came about back in 2006 when my son was born and we nicknamed him, Lil Boo.  Quite appropriate wouldn't you think?  It has been six amazing years learning and living life through the trials and tribulations of raising an infant to toddler to now kinder!  Being a former 'Daddy Blogger' (as cliche as it may sound these days) I wanted to write a children's book about my son and his real life experiences.  In doing so, I released Outside with Lil Boo - an outside rhyming adventure from A to Z.  Two years later, the sequel in the series was released, At the Zoo with Lil Boo - a charming learning adventure at the zoo with his friends.  It's now 2012 and we have come a long way:</p>
<ul>
<li>Officially picked up by a Traditional Publisher - Inkwell Productions in Scottsdale, Arizona - with both titles being re-published on January 14, 2012.</li>
<li>In the running for eight (8) children's literature awards between both titles so far this year.</li>
<li>Two (2) Five Star Reviews from Readers Favorite, one for each title.</li>
<li>At the Zoo with Lil Boo reached #29 on the best sellers list on Amazon for its category - Children's Books, Animals, Zoos.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now we want to take it a step further and bring Lil Boo off of the pages and into the hands of your child!  We have teamed up with the Owner of TG Bears to bring you the Official Lil Boo Doll.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need From You/Your Contribution</h3>
<p>You will be able to secure your own unique, handmade 10"" Lil Boo Doll through pledging.  The funds raised throughout this campaign will go towards creating the prototype and final Lil Boo Doll that will be made available for all to purchase.  We have listed an array of perks and we hope you will take advantage of them while supporting us in bringing Lil Boo to life!</p>
<p>Lil Boo Doll Specs</p>
<ul>
<li>10"" Tall</li>
<li>Interchangeable T-shirt (extra t-shirt options will be available at a later date).</li>
<li>Made in the USA exclusively by TG Bears.</li>
</ul>
<p>This would also be a great way to gear up for your next Boo at the Zoo visit!  How fitting would it be to take a copy of At the Zoo with Lil Boo along with your new favorite buddy, Lil Boo on your next Zoo trip?!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Additional Ways to Assist</h3>
<p>Please share our campaign with friends via Facebook, Twitter, Google, Word of Mouth any which way possible.  Yes, we are looking to make some noise with this in as short of time as possible.  We have the technology and the motivation.  Be one of the first to surprise your son or daughter with a unique, handmade Lil Boo Doll!</p>

Officially picked up by a Traditional Publisher - Inkwell Productions in Scottsdale, Arizona - with both titles being re-published on January 14, 2012.
In the running for eight (8) children's literature awards between both titles so far this year.
Two (2) Five Star Reviews from Readers Favorite, one for each title.
At the Zoo with Lil Boo reached #29 on the best sellers list on Amazon for its category - Children's Books, Animals, Zoos.

Now we want to take it a step further and bring Lil Boo off of the pages and into the hands of your child!  We have teamed up with the Owner of TG Bears to bring you the Official Lil Boo Doll.


What We Need From You/Your Contribution
You will be able to secure your own unique, handmade 10"" Lil Boo Doll through pledging.  The funds raised throughout this campaign will go towards creating the prototype and final Lil Boo Doll that will be made available for all to purchase.  We have listed an array of perks and we hope you will take advantage of them while supporting us in bringing Lil Boo to life!
Lil Boo Doll Specs

10"" Tall
Interchangeable T-shirt (extra t-shirt options will be available at a later date).

<h1>The RULER has finally come full circle</h1>
<p>The <em>Ring Ruler</em> addresses one of the most elemental structures in the physical world– the circle. Up until now, the primary tool for creating circles is the needle compass, which pivots on a sharp, centered point. While this method has remained practically unchanged for hundreds of years, we believe there is a better way. We think the solution lies in a more natural, circular gesture. <strong>Why not use a circle to create or measure a circle?</strong> Using this method of an expandable/contractable measuring ring, we are now able to provide metrics that have never before been possible in a single tool– namely DIAMETER, ARC LENGTH/CIRCUMFERENCE and even DEGREES. </p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 12px; font-weight: bold;""><img alt=""Snapping Ring Ruler into place"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/19977170/KT_Ring_Ruler_Kickstarter_handson.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p>The tactile feel of sizing the <em>Ring Ruler</em> by hand, snapping into place, and tracing the pencil along its curved profile is not only faster and far more satisfying, but it also allows for a much greater degree of control with respect to line consistency. That's because we've managed to keep the writing instrument where it belongs– in your hand.</p>
<h3><strong>π (Pi)</strong></h3>
<p>The principle behind the concept of the <em>Ring Ruler</em> is based on the very essence of π (pi). Many people know pi as the infinitely long number that starts 3.14159... but it is simply the direct relationship between circumference and diameter. More specifically, it is the arc length of a single increment of diameter, be it inches or centimeters. This property is uniquely illustrated with this tool in that the first unit of diameter in either scale equals 3.14 (pi) –hence, pi is literally baked into the <em>Ring Ruler</em>– allowing for the exclusive set of metrics it provides.</p>
<div class=""template asset""> <img alt=""Ring Ruler / Pi"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/19977170/KT_Ring_Ruler_Pi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
</div>
<h3><strong>Well-rounded Tool</strong></h3>
<p>Whether you're an artist, designer, architect, engineer, teacher, woodworker, quilter, craftsman or student –or you're just taking a geometry class– the <em>Ring Ruler</em> might prove to be a handy little tool to have in your arsenal. Useful for anything ranging from technical drafting to pattern-making to bowl decorating, it is also easily used with pencil, pen or marker.</p>
<div class=""template asset"">
<img alt=""Ring Ruler 360"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/19977170/RR_MG_6669.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </div>
<h3>Circular Logic</h3>
<p>We believe drawing circles should be easy; and learning about circles should be fun. The level of simplicity with which the <em>Ring Ruler</em> is handled and used opens some exciting possibilities with students and children of all ages. Teachers who may have been reluctant to hand out pointy compasses to young children can now encourage kids to actually play with these flexible, circular rulers. As much as we all love digital applications, there is a visceral stimulation with physical, hands-on instruction that creates stronger connections and invariably leads to greater understanding of fundamental concepts.</p>
<h3>To a Degree...</h3>
<p>In addition to creating perfect circles on the fly, the <em>Ring Ruler</em> also measures circles and 3D objects like cylinders, spheres and cones. In fact, it is really the first and only tool for actually <em>measuring</em> circles and arcs that does not involve calculation. </p>
<p>We've also recently added the ability to measure a full 360º, making the <em>Ring Ruler</em> the ultimate protractor! In order to accurately measure degrees, we must use a fixed diameter, to create a quadrant system– much like a clock. The markings indicate the snap-in point and the baseline is essentially formed at the 3:00 and 9:00 positions.</p>

<h1>The Prototypes</h1>
<p>The prototyping process is often the most extensive in the development of a tool such as this one– sometimes taking years and consuming exorbitant sums of money. We were lucky to have nailed the final design early on, with just some slight fine-tuning along the way to improve the circularity and overall strength of the ruler. </p>

</div>
<h1>Production</h1>
<p>We have been working on the design + prototyping of the Ring Ruler for about a year now. It has been in concurrent production with our first product, the <a href=""http://www.koalatools.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=KT-01"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><em>Versa Ruler</em></a>. We entered production of the Ring Ruler just over 3 months ago and have already completed the molds. The funding we receive will go directly toward finished parts and packaging of the <em>Ring Ruler</em>. Both US standard and metric scale versions are being made. We expect to have this product ready to ship by mid-December.</p>
<h1>Perks</h1>
<p>We tried to create some interesting combinations of perks for our backers. At $10, you are essentially pre-ordering a Ring Ruler– and also joining us through this last stretch of bringing this product to the market. We also added our first product, the shape-making <a href=""http://www.koalatools.com/ProductDetails.asp?ProductCode=KT-01"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><em>Versa Ruler</em></a>, to our list of perks. We hope you like them.</p>

<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>We are lifelong friends who come from the seemingly different worlds of biomedical engineering and media design. A little over 2 years ago, a chance conversation about linear motion mechanisms led to some tinkering, and the idea for our shape-shifting tools was born. Once the concepts and designs were nailed, we began working feverishly to make these tools a reality and formed <a href=""http://koalatools.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Koala Tools</a> to commercialize our endeavor.</p>
<h1>The Circle is Complete</h1>
<p>We are extremely excited to bring this product to the world. What started as a kind of 4D puzzle to us has resulted in something that we are remarkably proud of. We would like to express our sincere thanks to everyone who decides to support this project and help us to ignite a ruling revolution!</p>

We think the solution lies in a more natural, circular gesture. Why not use a circle to create or measure a circle? Using this method of an expandable/contractable measuring ring, we are now able to provide metrics that have never before been possible in a single tool– namely DIAMETER, ARC LENGTH/CIRCUMFERENCE and even DEGREES. 

The tactile feel of sizing the Ring Ruler by hand, snapping into place, and tracing the pencil along its curved profile is not only faster and far more satisfying, but it also allows for a much greater degree of control with respect to line consistency. That's because we've managed to keep the writing instrument where it belongs– in your hand.
π (Pi)
The principle behind the concept of the Ring Ruler is based on the very essence of π (pi). Many people know pi as the infinitely long number that starts 3.14159... but it is simply the direct relationship between circumference and diameter. More specifically, it is the arc length of a single increment of diameter, be it inches or centimeters. This property is uniquely illustrated with this tool in that the first unit of diameter in either scale equals 3.14 (pi) –hence, pi is literally baked into the Ring Ruler– allowing for the exclusive set of metrics it provides.
 

Well-rounded Tool
Whether you're an artist, designer, architect, engineer, teacher, woodworker, quilter, craftsman or student –or you're just taking a geometry class– the Ring Ruler might prove to be a handy little tool to have in your arsenal. Useful for anything ranging from technical drafting to pattern-making to bowl decorating, it is also easily used with pencil, pen or marker.

 
Circular Logic
We believe drawing circles should be easy; and learning about circles should be fun. The level of simplicity with which the Ring Ruler is handled and used opens some exciting possibilities with students and children of all ages. Teachers who may have been reluctant to hand out pointy compasses to young children can now encourage kids to actually play with these flexible, circular rulers. As much as we all love digital applications, there is a visceral stimulation with physical, hands-on instruction that creates stronger connections and invariably leads to greater understanding of fundamental concepts.
To a Degree...
In addition to creating perfect circles on the fly, the Ring Ruler also measures circles and 3D objects like cylinders, spheres and cones. In fact, it is really the first and only tool for actually measuring circles and arcs that does not involve calculation. 
We've also recently added the ability to measure a full 360º, making the Ring Ruler the ultimate protractor! In order to accurately measure degrees, we must use a fixed diameter, to create a quadrant system– much like a clock. The markings indicate the snap-in point and the baseline is essentially formed at the 3:00 and 9:00 positions.
IMPRINT OF METRICS (US Standard version)

The Prototypes
The prototyping process is often the most extensive in the development of a tool such as this one– sometimes taking years and consuming exorbitant sums of money. We were lucky to have nailed the final design early on, with just some slight fine-tuning along the way to improve the circularity and overall strength of the ruler. 
Prototype to Production Evolution:
 

Production
We have been working on the design + prototyping of the Ring Ruler for about a year now. It has been in concurrent production with our first product, the Versa Ruler. We entered production of the Ring Ruler just over 3 months ago and have already completed the molds. The funding we receive will go directly toward finished parts and packaging of the Ring Ruler. Both US standard and metric scale versions are being made. We expect to have this product ready to ship by mid-December.
Perks
We tried to create some interesting combinations of perks for our backers. At $10, you are essentially pre-ordering a Ring Ruler– and also joining us through this last stretch of bringing this product to the market. We also added our first product, the shape-making Versa Ruler, to our list of perks. We hope you like them.
 

About Us
We are lifelong friends who come from the seemingly different worlds of biomedical engineering and media design. A little over 2 years ago, a chance conversation about linear motion mechanisms led to some tinkering, and the idea for our shape-shifting tools was born. Once the concepts and designs were nailed, we began working feverishly to make these tools a reality and formed Koala Tools to commercialize our endeavor.
The Circle is Complete
We are extremely excited to bring this product to the world. What started as a kind of 4D puzzle to us has resulted in something that we are remarkably proud of. We would like to express our sincere thanks to everyone who decides to support this project and help us to ignite a ruling revolution!",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>
<strong>Efflora</strong> = Effloresce (to bloom or blossom) + Flora (The plant community)</h3>
<p>The Idea for <strong>Efflora Jewelry Studio</strong> was born nearly 4 years ago during a landscape construction installation I was working on in New York.  The concept  appeared before my eyes as I was preparing a hole in the ground to plant a Daylily flower at my customers' residence.  I began wondering if there was any type of jewelry made to attach real flowers, on the market.  After much research, I soon realized there was not.  My mind became flooded with designs for this concept, and took several years to work out the kinks.  The past 12 months I have dedicated to metalsmithing and refining my years of imagining.  The concept finally works, and here we are today.  I just need your passion, enthusiasm and support to help get this project off the ground and out to the public.  The feedback has already been overwhelmingly positive, and I hope you agree.  The possibility for uses of this product is incredible, and actually reaches beyond jewelry.  As you read on, you will see the plans Im developing for future applications if the funding reaches certain goals.  New ideas are always welcomed If you have thought of something that I have not already.  Thanks for taking the time to visit <strong>Efflora Jewelry Studio</strong>!  </p>
<h2>HOW IT'S UNIQUE</h2>
<p><strong>Efflora Jewelry Studio</strong> is the worlds first jewelry designed to have live flowers securely attached to them, through a unique and proprietary connection type.  This connection already has the patent process underway.  It solves all of the problems of a historical attempt at this concept.  In the 18th Century, affluent women, at times, wore a type of brooch, which simply placed a live flower into a small vase-like container filled with water.  In addition to needing to have the stem attached to stay put (which was rather bulky), these products were unsucessful in many other ways.  Since the flower was only held in by gravity, the flower could be blown out by wind, or fall out if you bent over... along with all of the water spilling on you and the ground. </p>
<p><strong>Efflora</strong> uses a stainless steel double pin connection that pierces the underside (receptacle) of the flower and holds it firmly in place.  The stem is not needed for it to be attached and kept alive, which is better aesthetically and less cumbersome.  A natural sea sponge is seated behind the pins in a stainless steel dome.  The sponge, when moistened, absorbs and retains water which is carried through to the flower gradually throughout the day.  In my trials, this has increased the flowers freshness 5 to 20 times longer than if it was cut under the blossom and left without water (each plant varies).  Usually the sponge need only be moistened once a day, unless temperatures are extreme and humidity is very low.  </p>
<p>This connection forms the body of the jewelry and is used rather universally on my products thus far.  This makes a cohesive and unified jewelry line that is true to its design, and adheres to the basic principal of 'Form Follows Function'.  </p>
<p>Adding to the beautiful spherical form of the <strong>Efflora</strong> connection, is an accessory development called 'Drops'.  Drops take the opportunity of using the upright pins, which hold the flower on, to hang beautiful and interchangeable adornments.  Drops provide a dual function of beauty and versatility.  The same pair of earrings could be worn with different flowers and Drops to fit nearly any occasion, style or wardrobe.  I have introduced 4 Drop accessories available now, but will be adding more once Kickstarter is funded.  </p>
<h2>BENEFITS </h2>
<p><strong>Efflora</strong> will allow a woman to walk outside and pick a flower from wherever she may find it; a park, a garden, a planter etc. and attach it to herself immediately.  This opens the doors to not only a new avenue for accessorizing, but will expand the horizons on the types of flowers that would be used for decoration.  Some of the most beautiful flowers in the world are routinely overlooked as possibilities for use.  They may be found sitting in a meadow, alongside a stream, or blossoming on small trees and shrubs throughout the season.  As the designs evolve I hope to include a boutonniere for men in weddings as well.    </p>
<p>Side Note for thought:</p>
<p><strong>Efflora</strong> does not believe in the term ""weed"", which has a negative and pesky connotation.  Plants actively considered to be ""weeds"" are most often native plants that grow best at the locations and environments which they are found.  They are usually rapid growers, temperature hardy, require no maintenance or watering, and are found in abundance.  Through my experience in the plant world, I have seen some so-called ""weeds"" with the most beautiful flowers imaginable.  They are usually smaller in scale, and generally go unnoticed amongst our daily routines.  I see these plants all around us as perfect opportunities for decoration.  **<em>Efflora hopes to make an impact on the world by broadening the spectrum of flora than can be used for beautification beyond the 35-50 flowers normally found at all florists.</em>    </p>
<h2>MATERIALS &amp; ENVIRONMENT</h2>
<p>Almost all of the jewelry materials are made out of 316L surgical stainless steel. The exception is the headband which is made from bronze wire, though the flower connectors are still all stainless steel on it.  The highest quality steel is used since it is hypo-allergenic, corrosion resistant, and super strong!  It also happens to be beautiful, especially when heated with a flame.. it turns a vivid antique golden color with some hints of purple.  Jewelry can come in either a silver finish or this antique gold finish.  I try to keep as many materials as natural  and high-quality as possible.  Most gemstones are real, if not they are glass, and my sponges are natural Grass Sponges harvested and purchased from a local shop off of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico.  They are highly durable, absorbent, and pretty.  </p>
<p>Having a lengthy background in landscape architecture and horticulture, the issue of Environment was has always been a passion of mine.  I am <strong>LEED </strong>certified (<strong>L</strong>eadership in <strong>E</strong>nergy and <strong>E</strong>nvironmental <strong>D</strong>esign), and so try to remain as 'Green', sustainable, and environmentally responsible as possible.  You can feel confident that there is no harming the environment from supporting Efflora products.  Quite on the contrary, Efflora aims to bring about a new appreciation for nature and plants by utilizing the beauty that mother nature affords us each season.  Picking flowers to adorn your body, encourages the minimization of industrial global impacts created through traditional manufacturing.  It will not harm the plant either, if picked properly.  My sponge supplier is also responsible and harvests correctly, which actually helps the sponge population multiply and thrive.  Each sponge grows back quickly, and after cut, is squeezed to release its spores back into the ocean for rapid population growth.          </p>
<h2>FUNDING GOALS</h2>
<p>$11,000 is the bare minimum to bring this project to life.  The $ will be used to buy expensive equipment that is imperative to the manufacturing process.  It will also be used to build a professional website and buy the materials needed to produce the first line of jewelry.  If funding exceeds the minimum, there are carefully planned uses for the additional capital.  The plan below explains what the additional capital would be used for.  </p>
<p><strong>11K- Project minimum goal- </strong>$ goes towards larger needed tools, website development, &amp; materials for the Efflora Jewelry pieces to be produced.</p>
<p><strong>25K</strong>- Efflora can bring new jewelry pieces to the line, including; hair bands, rings, necklaces, bracelets, and have the stainless steel discs manufactured.</p>
<p><strong>50K</strong>- Jewelry parts manufacturing within the USA can be achieved at this point, expanding the reach to a much larger market base.  </p>
<p><strong>100K</strong>- Opens us to the manufacturing of artificial flowers that will be designed to attach to the Efflora double-pin connection.  (This will be perfect for the winter, or when fresh flowers are not available).  A secondary line of gold, silver, and gemstones can be pursued &amp; new products such as a Dog Collar collection, and a redesigned safety line for infants and toddlers.  </p>

Our patent pending system of micro screwless hinges enable the first truly pocketable folding shades.
 

ROAV sunglasses clock in at mere 8.5 mm when folded. Folding Wayfarers are nearly four times as thick, and nowhere near thin enough to pocket. The difference is in our design approach. Our competitors simply modify existing frames to create foldability. ROAV isn't burdened by heritage and doesn't use any stock components. We design our eyewear from the ground up to be both beautiful and truly pocketable. ROAV sunglasse s are constructed from scratch-resistant ion-plated stainless steel. Our patent pending system of micro screwless spring hinges require zero maintenance and won't loosen over time. The flat folding design eliminates pressure on the hinges when the glasses are folded, so you can feel comfortable putting them in your back pocket or purse.Spring hinges and individually adjustable temples ensure a stable and tailored fit on most face shapes and sizes. Weighing in at under 20 grams, ROAV sunglasses will remain comfortable all day long.We selected premium nylon lenses for their lightness and flexibility. The addition of a polarizing filter ensures maximum reduction of glare. All our lenses provide UV and IR protection and are coated to resist reflections, fingerprints, and scratches. Protective yet minimal, our handmade pouch is constructed from 100% vegetable tanned leather. 
 Unlike a standard eyewear screw hinge that is glued, soldered, or riveted to the frame, our unique screwless hinges are actually press formed into the sheet metal frame itself. This ultra minimal construction enables a design that is incredibly small and durable. The hinges also have an inherent springiness, so they won't come loose over time and prevent the glasses from folding or unfolding unintentionally.ROAV folding frames, FF for short, inject modern practicality into iconic eyewear frame styles.

About deap
We are the first one and only pure freestyle canyoning brand named ""deap"". Founded in 2012 by Warren Verboom. He's been a passionate canyoneer for 13 years. Warren, a former sponsored adidas athlete, was working as a canyoning guide when he assembled the ""deap"" freestyle canyoning team. Made up of all different athletes from all walks of life. In the meantime his team have produced four canyoning films, which are famous for their unique style. The freestyle canyoning!
 


 
The ""freestyle canyoning wetsuit"" is not only a promotion to sell the best wetsuit for canyoning. No it's far more the development of a pure canyoning brand. With our love for canyoning it seems necessary to us to create such a brand. Even though this market is still very small.
With your support this campaign will help us to become a pure canyoning brand that is willing to revamp and push the sport forward.
Order your freestyle wetsuit through Indiegogo and you can take advantage of Early Bird Pricing, and receiving your product way before they become available to the public. Your wetsuit will ship in April of 2017.

If you like what we do and you would like to support us, but wild horses couldn’t drag you in a canyon, then please check our various products and kick-ass perks!
