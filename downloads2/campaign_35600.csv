<p>WE MAKE PEACE is a voluntary based non-profit organization working to spread peace education internationally through our materials, workshops and campaigns. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><i><b>We believe Peace Education should be taught in every school in every country of the world. </b></i></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>After having effectively run peace education campaigns and workshops in Denmark with more than a hundred schools involved, including collaborations with organizations such as UNICEF, Amnesty International and human rights bodies, running pilot projects in UK schools as well as exciting new education programs in Uganda, East Africa, WE MAKE PEACE is now ready to take this experience to the masses. And what better place to start than New York City?</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Our Campaign<br/>
</h3>
<p>We are thrilled to have found this platform to raise money for our campaign <i>A PLEAD FOR PEACE</i>: </p>
<p>We wish to raise $5,000 to carry out an extensive tour of the schools in New York City with the peace education workshop, <i>A PLEAD FOR PEACE</i>. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>A Plead For Peace<br/>
</h3>
<p><i>A PLEAD FOR PEACE</i> is an interactive workshop. We teach students (aged 8-13 years) how to make peace within, with each other, in the classroom and in society. </p>
<p>The workshop is based on learning key issues of: </p>
<p>• Human rights</p>
<p>• Human needs</p>
<p>• Conflict resolution</p>
<p>• Anti-bullying principles</p>
<p>• And the core values that spell out <b><i>P L E A D:</i></b>  </p>
<p><i><b>P= Positivity  L= Love  E= Empathy  A= Acceptance  and  D= Democracy. </b></i></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The program is taught through open debate and student interaction.  </p>
<p><i><br/></i></p>
<p><i>""Peace education is needed not just in societies marked by war, but in all societies that are serious about living in peaceful societies. Peace education is currently not on the curriculum, but should be prioritized right from the top. WE MAKE PEACE makes peace education fun, creative and interactive.""</i> Founder Marie Mamonia.  <br/></p>

<h3>Timeline<br/>
</h3>
<p>We wish to start the tour of the schools this year beginning in Brooklyn, in the fall of 2011, starting from October. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">The workshop will be held by director and speaker Marie Mamonia. The workshop is interactive and can engage larger groups (150-200 students) as well as class groups (20-30 students). </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""> </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Marie will also be responsible for the project to be both viable financially and achieve its’ goals actively.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you are a teacher and would like to see this workshop in your school, please donate any amount you can, and help us on our way by spreading the word. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you just think this sounds amazing, as do we:-) then you can help too by sharing this link and donating anything you can spare. It all starts with you. </p>

<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;"">The Impact</span><br/></p>
<div>
<p>We work with social change. </p>
<p>WE MAKE PEACE promotes learning that enables student participation in a positive and safe environment. </p>
<p>We believe in giving students essential personal life skills for personal growth, as well as a set of creative problem-shooting tools, which builds confidence and establish a set of common values for the classroom, and the school necessary for peaceful coexistence. </p>
<p>This will benefit not only the children involved, but the whole environment at the school, and the local community these children come into contact with (i.e. friends, family, teachers, coaches, social clubs, sports clubs, religious groups and other social groups). </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(77,77,77);""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(77,77,77);"">Without this campaign children are likely to never come across peace education during their primary school years. Children especially from disadvantaged or crime-ridden areas are likely not to develop peaceful conflict resolution skills, and a socially caring, loving behavior towards others in the community. This means a world with more aggression, more bullying, more violence, fear and ultimately more crime. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(77,77,77);""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(77,77,77);"">When it comes to peace-making it starts with us... Me and you! </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(77,77,77);"">It starts right a root level, learning peace skills at an early age will resonate positively through society at every level. </span></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need cash to make it happen. Your donation will go towards building the props for the workshop (essential part of the workshop are 13 tailored alphabet-suits made out of fabric and foam, stickers and posters for participating schools), transport (to and from schools), promotional articles (print and digital including website updates). </p>

</div></div>","Peace Education
WE MAKE PEACE is a voluntary based non-profit organization working to spread peace education internationally through our materials, workshops and campaigns. 

We believe Peace Education should be taught in every school in every country of the world. 

After having effectively run peace education campaigns and workshops in Denmark with more than a hundred schools involved, including collaborations with organizations such as UNICEF, Amnesty International and human rights bodies, running pilot projects in UK schools as well as exciting new education programs in Uganda, East Africa, WE MAKE PEACE is now ready to take this experience to the masses. And what better place to start than New York City?

Our Campaign

We are thrilled to have found this platform to raise money for our campaign A PLEAD FOR PEACE: 
We wish to raise $5,000 to carry out an extensive tour of the schools in New York City with the peace education workshop, A PLEAD FOR PEACE. 

A Plead For Peace

A PLEAD FOR PEACE is an interactive workshop. We teach students (aged 8-13 years) how to make peace within, with each other, in the classroom and in society. 
The workshop is based on learning key issues of: 
• Human rights
• Human needs
• Conflict resolution
• Anti-bullying principles
• And the core values that spell out P L E A D:  
P= Positivity  L= Love  E= Empathy  A= Acceptance  and  D= Democracy. 

The program is taught through open debate and student interaction.  

""Peace education is needed not just in societies marked by war, but in all societies that are serious about living in peaceful societies. Peace education is currently not on the curriculum, but should be prioritized right from the top. WE MAKE PEACE makes peace education fun, creative and interactive."" Founder Marie Mamonia.

Watch a YouTube clip from our UK launch at Camp Bestival here. 
Timeline

We wish to start the tour of the schools this year beginning in Brooklyn, in the fall of 2011, starting from October. 
 
The workshop will be held by director and speaker Marie Mamonia. The workshop is interactive and can engage larger groups (150-200 students) as well as class groups (20-30 students). 
 
Marie will also be responsible for the project to be both viable financially and achieve its’ goals actively.
 
If you are a teacher and would like to see this workshop in your school, please donate any amount you can, and help us on our way by spreading the word. 
 
If you just think this sounds amazing, as do we:-) then you can help too by sharing this link and donating anything you can spare. It all starts with you. 

 
The Impact

We work with social change. 
WE MAKE PEACE promotes learning that enables student participation in a positive and safe environment. 
We believe in giving students essential personal life skills for personal growth, as well as a set of creative problem-shooting tools, which builds confidence and establish a set of common values for the classroom, and the school necessary for peaceful coexistence. 
This will benefit not only the children involved, but the whole environment at the school, and the local community these children come into contact with (i.e. friends, family, teachers, coaches, social clubs, sports clubs, religious groups and other social groups). 

Without this campaign children are likely to never come across peace education during their primary school years. Children especially from disadvantaged or crime-ridden areas are likely not to develop peaceful conflict resolution skills, and a socially caring, loving behavior towards others in the community. This means a world with more aggression, more bullying, more violence, fear and ultimately more crime. 

When it comes to peace-making it starts with us... Me and you! 
It starts right a root level, learning peace skills at an early age will resonate positively through society at every level. 



What We Need & What You Get
We need cash to make it happen. Your donation will go towards building the props for the workshop (essential part of the workshop are 13 tailored alphabet-suits made out of fabric and foam, stickers and posters for participating schools), transport (to and from schools), promotional articles (print and digital including website updates). 
Even if we don't reach the full campaign amount, we guarantee that your donation will go towards getting this workshop into as many schools as possible. 
What you get is the change to fund something really worthwhile for children in the New York City area. We value your contribution endlessly and will make sure to provide all supporters with briefs and updates on how this project is doing along the way, so you can see just where your money went and how it's all going.

<h2><em>BACKGROUND</em></h2>
<p><em>WHO ARE WE? </em></p>
<p>Aid for Kids is a 501 (c) 3 non-profit organization. Our MISSION is to improve the lives of children and families worldwide through food, shelter, education, and healthcare.  We work to identify the challenges children face in low income and impoverished communities, and we implement creative projects to address those issues.  In Vietnam, there is an enormous need for special education support, especially for those born with autism. Therefore, the aim of Aid for Kid's newest endeavor, the AUTISM EDUCAITON PROJECT is to provide training to parents, teachers, and organizations closely affected by autism. IN ADDITION, we will be providing first time education to children living in an orphanage in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. </p>
<p><em>WHAT IS AUTISM? </em></p>
<p>Autism is a disorder that is not bound by culture or class and it is not determined by ethnicity or environment. It is a disorder of abnormal brain development that affects nearly every part of a child's life. Children born with autism have an extremely difficult time receiving and processing information; they display odd repetitive behavior and are anxious about changes in their environment. A child with autism can find it difficult to communicate with people, to look at or even be touched by other people, and it can be very frustrating for them to learn new things. </p>
<p>Awareness of autism has risen worldwide but lack of real understanding continues to plague the autism community. In developing countries, like Vietnam, understanding autism is only just beginning. Children with autism are rejected, stigmatized, and even abused; because of the many negative side effects associated with autism. Families are ostracized and parents are regarded as guilty with little social support. </p>
<p>The story of autism, however, is not one of despair; in fact, it is a story of hope and possibilities. Though put in an almost impossible position, parents and caretakers have not given up hope.  There is no cure for this disorder and it has been shown with appropriate intervention the severity of symptoms can be dramatically improved. Children with autism can learn and they have capabilities to do and become great individuals. The goal of providing autism education is to promote and encourage understanding, hope, and acceptance of people with different learning abilities. </p>
<h2 style=""margin-left: 150px;"">     What is our Plan? </h2>

<h2 style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong><span>Who are we helping and what are we doing?  </span></strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>""Training the Trainers""</em></strong></p>
<p>Parents and care providers in the United States have unparalleled access to a vault of knowledge and resources to educate children with autism. In Vietnam, however, caretakers are desperate for support and knowledge of how to educate and how to develop new skills in their children.  The goal of the Autism Education Project is to increase the capacity of support through education for these caretakers by  introducing them to contemporary methods of behavioral and educational therapy. Together, with a team of specialists, Aid for Kids is developing a culturally relevant and feasible training curriculum that will incorporate many of today's leading autism education practices.  </p>
<p>We will work with Tu Xuong Center, an orphanage for children with disabilities including autism and other related learning abilities.  The staff at Tu Xuong, along with selected individuals from the community, including leaders of parent support groups and teachers will receive the training curriculum first.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><em>""Teaching the Children""</em></strong></p>
<p>Children with autism at Tu Xuong have had limited access to education. However, the Autism Education Project will allow us to provide education to these children.  This is a great opportunity for those who undergo the training curriculum to apply their knowledge in practical hands on experience. It is the combination of real time practice and traditional lectures that makes this project unique. The dual learning process will help to better improve and cement the caretakers knowledge of how to care for and improve the lives of the children with autism who are in their care.</p>
<p><strong><em> </em></strong> </p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 150px;"">PROJECT GOALS</h3>
<p>•  Train a staff of educators and caretakers capable of implementing teaching strategies to successfully reach children with autism; </p>

<h3><em>Mambo!</em></h3>
<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>My name is Saylor Gibbs. I am about to finish my first year of undergraduate study at the University of California, Los Angeles. I plan to major in Neuroscience so that I can attend medical school and become a Neurosurgeon.</p>
<p>I have always been fascinated with medicine and anything involving health education. Within my first weeks at UCLA, I applied and was accepted into the Pediatric AIDS Coalition at UCLA, an entirely student-run philanthropic organization that aims to educate UCLA and the surrounding communities about the stigma attached to HIV/AIDS and the need to prevent the passage of HIV/AIDS from mother to child. Every year, the Pediatric AIDS Coalition puts on a 26-hour Dance Marathon, during which over 1,000 dancers pledge to stay on their feet for 26 hours to raise money and awareness for Pediatric HIV/AIDS. This year, we raised over $515,000 during February's Dance Marathon.</p>
<p><em>How does this connect to my campaign?</em></p>
<p>This summer, I will be traveling to Arusha, Tanzania to volunteer for 6 weeks with One Heart Source in a program of health education both in the classroom and in the community. I will be living with a wonderful Tanzanian family so I am in the process of learning Swahili, my third language.  I will be assigned a school and a classroom in which to teach and I'll construct my own curriculum and engage my students in activities and learning both in and out of the classroom. In addition, I will have the opportunity to connect and communicate with the greater community of my village to talk about topics that can help break down the stigma placed on sexual health and HIV/AIDS in Tanzania.</p>
<p><strong>Are you with me?</strong></p>
<p>Earlier this year, I was able to raise over $2,000.00 for the Pediatric AIDS Coalition (well over the required $500.00). I am committed to transparent fundraising efforts and will answer any questions regarding where the money is going and what it is used for.</p>
<p><strong>THE BREAKDOWN:</strong></p>
<p><em>What I need:</em></p>
<p>$5,000.00 US</p>
<p><em>Why I need it:</em></p>
<p>On May 23, 2012, I have to pay my program fee and travel expenses in order to be able to participate in the program.</p>
<p><em>What it pays for:</em></p>
<p>$3,050.00 US is the One Heart Source program fee, which covers - food, clean drinking water, housing, mosquito nets, teaching supplies, manuals, training supplies, English-Swahili training guides, on-site and pre-field orientation, transportation, 24-hour health services, a cell phone with international capabilities, and a volunteer residence permit.</p>
<p>$2,000.00 US will cover travel expenses - domestic and international airfaire and fees, vaccinations, and travel insurance.</p>
<p><em>Perks:</em></p>
<p>Donors that donate $50 will receive a t-shirt that I have designed with the One Heart Source logo and an elephant (trunk up for good luck) on the front in vibrant colors.</p>
<strong></strong>
<p><em>Why is this important to me?</em></p>
<p>I believe that everyone has the right to the life that they want for themselves. I decided to volunteer with the hope that I will be able to change lives, but also with the knowledge that I will be changed as well. Throughout the duration of my program, I hope to open the door for greater communication and education from both sides. I have a passion for learning and teaching, and I am unbelievably excited to be able to share that passion with others. I am also excited to engage in the tough conversations about sexual health and HIV/AIDS. Every man, woman, and child, should have the right to live in an AIDS-free generation without the heavy shroud of stigma placed on those with positive status. An HIV-positive status should never determine how a person is treated.</p>
<strong>LET'S DO THIS!</strong>
<p><em><strong>I am incredibly passionate about this amazing opportunity that is just out of reach. I need YOUR help to make it a reality. </strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Spread the word. Share the link. Post a status. Tweet. Sing. Email. Shout it from the rooftops. Whatever you like. Make some noise and help me realize my dream of going to Africa to teach people about HIV/AIDS and prevent the next generation from suffering and loss.</strong> </em></p>
<h3><em>Asante.</em></h3>
<p><strong>Thank you.</strong></p>

Donors that donate $50 will receive a t-shirt that I have designed with the One Heart Source logo and an elephant (trunk up for good luck) on the front in vibrant colors.

Why is this important to me?
I believe that everyone has the right to the life that they want for themselves. I decided to volunteer with the hope that I will be able to change lives, but also with the knowledge that I will be changed as well. Throughout the duration of my program, I hope to open the door for greater communication and education from both sides. I have a passion for learning and teaching, and I am unbelievably excited to be able to share that passion with others. I am also excited to engage in the tough conversations about sexual health and HIV/AIDS. Every man, woman, and child, should have the right to live in an AIDS-free generation without the heavy shroud of stigma placed on those with positive status. An HIV-positive status should never determine how a person is treated.
LET'S DO THIS!
I am incredibly passionate about this amazing opportunity that is just out of reach. I need YOUR help to make it a reality. 
Spread the word. Share the link. Post a status. Tweet. Sing. Email. Shout it from the rooftops. Whatever you like. Make some noise and help me realize my dream of going to Africa to teach people about HIV/AIDS and prevent the next generation from suffering and loss. 
Asante.
Thank you.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Hello and thank you for visiting our site!</h3>
    This project is sincerely intended to be a not-for-profit enterprise. We will be returning to Ecuador whether this idea is funded or is not. This is why we have asked the bare minimum of possible costs. Because not one dollar will be buying our plane tickets. All of the money will go towards quality educational material, good books, and supplies to improve and bring the best we can to the poor indigenous kids of Ecuador.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>     My name is Jeff Koldewyn and my partner is Marisabel Jimenez. Both of us have taught kids for many years and have been employed in the arena of education for over ten. I have worked with Portland Public Schools of Oregon. Marisabel has worked with the Montessori education. Both of us are fluent in Spanish.</div>
<div>     We discovered and fell in love with the Quechua kids when we first visited Ecuador in the month of October 2012. We visited their schools and immediately began working with their teachers. We began teaching free classes out of our friend's home. We coordinated and raised the hopes of the school principals and children or the area. All of them want us to return.</div>
<div>     This we will do. We have been able to save the finiances to get there and live for five months. We are also fortunate enough to have a place to stay and live at while we are there. We have been incredibly blessed to be able to be part of this community.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>     The money for this project is aimed at providing the best quality of education we possibly can. We intend to purchase and bring a lot of good books with us, which is why the deadline is so important in this project. Because we will have to carry it on the plane with us.</div>
<div>     The average Ecuadorian makes $375 dollars a month for the employed Ecuadorian. Yet, the employment rate sits at around 25%. This makes for a rough living standard and a sub-rate quality of life for the rural indigenous who are lucky to make $2 a day.</div>
<div>     Learning English will give these kids access to better jobs, enhance their experience with foreign tourists, and even give them the tools they need to fight big corporations that want to exploit their land.</div>
<div>      This is why we will return. We are needed and have the ability to really help!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>      We intend this project to be completely transparent and open. If you read the perks you will see that we are also inviting you to come and see the work we are doing. Luckily, we have dear friends with a home large enough that we have the ability to invite you as our guests.</div>
<div>      This is such a pure hearted people who will welcome you as they have us. You can rest assured knowing that these people truly do need and appreciate the aid that we offer by seeing it with your own eyes. We invite those who pledge more than a $100 dollars to stay at the house for free and to witness what this project really means.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>       In hopes of making this project truly successful, we have asked the bare mininmum of $2000. However, if we are to exceed this mark we will truthfully put it directly into aiding as many schools as we possibly can with the time we have. There are hundreds of rural schools that can truly benifit from quality material and we would love to reach as far as possible.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>       Once again I would like to thank you for considering this project and considering them. Without your help, we will still return to Ecuador. But with your help, we will return with wonderful books, paper, and writing tools to share. &lt;3</div>
<div> </div>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm Peter Lurvey, principal of St Aidan's Christan School, a grade 5-9 school.  We partner with Inner City Youth Alive, a Christian outreach organization that provides hope for families and kids.  We work in Winnipeg's tough North End.  How tough?  Within a mile of our little school, there were at least 5 murders in the last two years.  One Monday morning just last month, I came to school and there were police cars all over, looking for two young guys who had stabbed three people in a four block area around our school.  And it was only 9 in the morning.</p>
<p>Our kids have fallen through the cracks of normal schools - like a Grade 5 kid with math skills at Grade 1, or a Grade Seven kid reading at Grade 2. Some of our kids come to us out of the Manitoba Youth Centre - a youth jail.  </p>
<p>We have a small student/teacher ratio - 8 kids to one adult - so we can take time to teach the basics and get kids on to high school.  And we do this on less that 45% of what the local publics schools get per kid.  We are private ""funded independent school,"" but we don't charge tuition.  We give kids breakfast and lunch every day of school.  And we are looking to expand to include new-comer kids who need to learn the basics of English and life in Canada.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As we grow, we are taking under our wings an ""unfunded independent school"" run by Francine, a woman who has been teaching new-comer kids - for no pay! - this past year.  Francine's kids are in the same boat as St Aidan's kids - not reading at grade level, headed for gangs, jail, exploitation, with no future and no hope.  Francine and her family sold their suburban home to buy and live in a building in the downtown core area of Winnipeg, so they could run a school for new-comer kids.</p>
<p>As we get ready for 36 new-comer kids at our satellite school in Winnipeg's Clavary Temple, we are figuring out staffing needs - Francine as Vice Principal, a teacher, some Education Assistants, and uh-oh!  We can't afford the Teacher of English as a Secodn or Other Language!  ""No trouble,"" says Francine.  ""Take my pay and let's hire that TOESOL teacher.""  Finally, after being underpaid for two years, and NOT paid for a year, facing a modest $30,000 income, she says, ""Take my pay.""  </p>
<p>I would like you to help us pay Francine.  She has dedicated herself to Community literacy and development, helping new-comers learn to speak Englsih, to read, to do math, to do well in school - and many of these kids have NEVER been in school.   And now, on the verge of actully getting paid, she has said NO - give it to where it is needed.  So typical of her.  </p>
<p>Well, we need to pay Francine as our literacy resource person.  We need her to be actually, finally, PAID.  She is vital to our school and to our growth.  Will you help us pay Francine, so we can more effectively keep kids off the streets, out of gangs, off drugs, out of the sex trade?  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Want to do something about those kids who drop out of school and get in deep with gangs, drugs, booze, getting pimped, jacking stuff, fighting, killing folks?  Help us give Francine a secure financial base, so she can actually get paid, instead of selflessly giving it up for another, for the sake of the kids.  </p>
<p>Maybe you teach or taught, and you always saw some kid with promise slip away as you had to tend to the 27 other kids in your class.  Give, so Francine can step in where you couldn't.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't give to help us raise $30,000 to actually pay Francine, you know someone who can.  Could you share Francine's story with your friends, your folks, your boss, your gramma?  Could you help by sharing a link to this site?  Could you pray?  Ask God to move hearts and wallets?  Bless you.  Bless you.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Heather DiNunzio, I'm a Fashion Design major at <em>Moore College of Art and Design</em>, with a minor in Business. I would like to raise money through this campaign for my senior collection for Fashion Design. A senior collection for a Fashion Major is 5- 7 garments that were chosen from a larger collection of designs by a critic. From there, the garments chosen are made by the student, who is responsible for all expenses. This collection is the culmination of 4 years of education at <em>Moore</em>, and is one of the most important and critical things that the Fashion Industry looks at when they are looking to hire a designer. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The expenses of my collection will be high, because I would like to design lingerie, using fabrics such as silk, satin, chiffon, brocade and damask. These fabrics can run for as much as $75 per yard. Fabric isn't the only thing that is used in clothing, however. Zippers, clasps, buttons, and other embellishments do add up in cost. I am also going to be responsible for providing my models with accesories, including shoes and any jewelry, make up products, and a hair stylist. I have estimated these costs to be about $2000 all together, if not more. </p>
<p>The perks I am offering are as follows:</p>
<p><strong>$1- Donation Box</strong></p>
<p><em>You'll recieve my undying gratitude and a thank you email. </em></p>
<p><strong>$5- Manners Matter</strong></p>
<p><em>You'll recieve a hand written, personalized thank you card fr</em>om me.</p>
<p><strong>$15- Helping Hands</strong></p>
<p><em>You'll recieve a handmade cotton bag with a drawstring that is about 4"" x 4"". This can be used for whatever you want, I use them for jewelry.</em></p>
<p><strong>$40- Designer, M.D.</strong></p>
<p><em>You'll recieve a handmade, cutomized cotton scrub cap, perfect for anyone in the medical field, and also a thank you email. I've already made about 20 of these for doctors at </em>ECMC Hospital<em> in </em>Buffalo, NY<em>, and have gotten great reviews. </em></p>
<p><strong>$65- Dedicated Donor</strong></p>
<p><em>You'll recieve all of the perks of </em>""Designer, M.D.""<em> and </em>""Helping Hands,""<em> as well as a handwritten thank you note. </em></p>
<p><strong>$100- Educational Enthusiast</strong></p>
<p><em>Two (2) handmade, customized cotton scrub caps, and two (2) handmade cotton drawstring bags, as well as a handwritten thank you card.</em></p>
<p>Any extra funds will go towards further expenses of my education, including tuition costs.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Any help that you can give me will allow me to get one step closer to achieving my dream of designing lingerie as a career. Thank you for anything you can do!!!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are unable to help financially, that's perfectly ok! Just get the word out about my campaign, and you can also use the Facebook and Twitter tools provided by Indiegogo. </p>
<p> </p>

<strong>***UPDATE:</strong><br/><strong>For those of you who choose to claim a perk that includes one or more scrub caps or jewelry bags, I'll get in touch with you via email once the campaign ends to discuss color choices. Thank you for your support!</strong>

<p>Dear Supporters, </p>
<p>We are John, Guillermo, and
Marina. We’re practitioners of Traditional Chinese medicine; which is the
most ancient and well-developed form of holistic medicine. This is the art that
includes acupuncture, herbal medicine, massage &amp; body-work, dietary
&amp; lifestyle therapeutics, specialized exercises like tai chi &amp; chi
kung, and much more.</p>
<p>We live a humble but happy life in the
mountains of Costa Rica, close to the city San Isidro del General. Our
daily passion is to <i>help</i> our community throughdonation-based
treatments &amp; <i>needed</i> education. They return the <i>favor</i> with
what they have: perhaps with eggs or bread, <i>sharing</i> their skills
&amp; labor, or by learning to treat others in return.</p>
<p>We have already helped countless people. Some
patients come with simple cases, others present serious diseases, either
case their health and quality of life have been improved significantly.
Furthermore, we educate our patients, teaching them the necessary tools they

We are John, Guillermo, and
Marina. We’re practitioners of Traditional Chinese medicine; which is the
most ancient and well-developed form of holistic medicine. This is the art that
includes acupuncture, herbal medicine, massage & body-work, dietary
& lifestyle therapeutics, specialized exercises like tai chi & chi
kung, and much more.
We live a humble but happy life in the
mountains of Costa Rica, close to the city San Isidro del General. Our
daily passion is to help our community throughdonation-based
treatments & needed education. They return the favor with
what they have: perhaps with eggs or bread, sharing their skills
& labor, or by learning to treat others in return.
We have already helped countless people. Some
patients come with simple cases, others present serious diseases, either
case their health and quality of life have been improved significantly.
Furthermore, we educate our patients, teaching them the necessary tools they
need to achieve a healthy state of being.  
Unfortunately, our efforts are very limited

<h3><b>Who We Are</b></h3>
<p>alQaws for Sexual and Gender Diversity in Palestinian Society is the leading Palestinian LGBTQ organization (a formal non-governmental organization) and the only group working on both sides of the Green Line. We work directly with Palestinian civil society to create a sustainable, persistent, community-based social change movement. Active at every level of Palestinian civil society, alQaws supports resilient LGBTQ communities and leads civil society’s critical social engagement with sexual and gender diversity. Drawing from a wealth of activist, professional, and creative capacities, we incite social change on the issue of gender and sexual diversity in relation to broader political struggles and everyday life. </p>
<h3><b>What We Do and Why</b></h3>
<p>alQaws creates opportunities for critical, creative social engagement by creating strong networks, resilient LGBTQ communities, and more open and engaged civil society institutions. Working in multiple geographic locations on both sides of the Green Line (including Yaffa, East Jerusalem, Ramallah and Haifa), and within constraints on Palestinian mobility imposed by Israeli military occupation, we have initiated new partnerships with professional human rights workers, with youth and students, with artists and cultural workers, and with healthcare and education professionals.</p>
<p>alQaws develops diverse and previously non-existent support services for LGBTQ individuals, we organize activist-minded community-building groups, cultural events, and health initiatives, and we lead large-scale artistic cultural production and social change efforts that harness grassroots as well as institutional power. Our most recent direct engagements with civil society include: conducting collaborative research on current attitudes and practices with regard to gender and sexuality in professional civil society organizations; launching a creative multi-media (including original music, video, photography) project engaging youth and artists; and supporting a range of other innovative, creative, cultural and professional projects with women, trans, and youth activists.</p>
<p>Our experienced, critical view of our society affirms that issues of gender and sexuality permeate all aspects of human rights, political, and cultural work. alQaws prioritizes direct work with civil society actors comprised of formal NGOs, informal political and social groups and movements, cultural producers (like musicians and artists), and local media.</p>
<p>We have made significant progress toward our goals to increase and promote alternative approaches to sexual and gender discourse and visibility in Palestinian society and to pave the road for a social justice movement in which LGBTQ rights are recognized and accepted as integral to broader sexual and human rights. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">It is now more important than ever that alQaws—an LGBTQ Palestinian group—is supported in this work to achieve our desired social change, using strategies informed by our many years of experience and research.</span></p>
<h3><b>Contribute to Our Vision for the Future</b></h3>
<p>Your support helps alQaws sustain this incredible momentum and to continue expanding and strengthening our support and leadership groups, our leadership-building and educational projects, and our large-scale civil society networking and multimedia artistic and cultural projects. We are confident that our society is ready for alQaws and the issue of sexual and gender diversity to take a more large-scale and visible role in Palestinian society’s vision for social justice, and we hope you will join us.</p>

<h3>More About the Context in Which We Work</h3>
<p>alQaws work crosses locations, media, societal and political boundaries to incite broad social change. Our progress at each level of our work—Individual, Community, Social Change—directly supports building the society we envision, particularly through the connections fostered between these levels. For instance, we mobilize individuals to build community and advocate for the kind of social change that in turn celebrates individual diversity, cultural tradition, and the participation of all members of society. </p>
<p>We continue to experience the impact of alQaws’ increasing local and global political role with a growing number of new members, the international visibility of alQaws’ vocal critique of Israeli misuses of queer issues in the region, and the growing regional and global awareness of our work as an important aspect of broader Palestinian social justice. Thus, we also aim to demonstrate and inspire the inclusion of issues related to gender and sexual diversity as part of broader social justice organizing, and therefore to combat perceptions that LGBTQ organizing is a separate, irrelevant, or foreign form of political, cultural and social action.</p>
<p>We cannot work towards sexual liberation within our communities without addressing the broader liberation of the Palestinian people.To understand the context for our struggle and our evolving strategies, the material and conceptual effects of the ongoing Israeli occupation must be acknowledged.  Our experience of the Occupation testifies to the fact that occupation does not differentiate between LGBTQ and non-LGBTQ Palestinians, and in fact actively contaminates inter-personal relationships and larger political processes. Israeli-imposed military occupation practices, including borders and apartheid walls, impacts and constrains our daily activities and long-term goals.</p>
<p>We continue to work to counteract oppressive structures of racism, socio-economic injustice, militarism, sexism and homophobia that disproportionately affect Palestinians, and to combat pervasive entrenched hierarchical working practices in the most influential institutions working in and with Palestinian societies. Moreover, since our work directly speaks with and to Palestinian society, our work at every level challenges deep-rooted misperceptions and taboos about sexual and gender identity, including homosexuality.</p>

<p>For the past few years, we have desired to work more closely with the people of Southeast Asia. Through our experiences working with refugees, we have developed a passion to reach out to the beautiful people of this region and empower them through the outlets of education and community development.</p>
<p>This summer, we have an opportunity to do just that, by spending six weeks in Northern Thailand!  Ricky, a first grade teacher, will be using his skills in education and information technology to support the work of an international school in Chiang Rai.  Amy, a graduate student in public health, will be working with a local organization to expand community health services to rural villagers in Thailand.  This is a dream come true for us, and we would love for you to be a part of our journey!</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In order to make this happen, we need help to cover the costs of plane tickets and some minor expenses while we are there.  Living expenses in Thailand will be fairly cheap--it's the plane tickets that bear the brunt of the cost.  All of the funds we raise will go directly to covering those basic costs for us to go to Thailand this summer.  Even if we don't raise the total amount, it will still help us to cover costs that we wouldn't otherwise be able to afford (we are a school teacher and a graduate student, after all).</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Education and health are some of the most valuable tools for raising people out of poverty and empowering them to reach their fullest potential.  This is what we want to accomplish while we are in Thailand this summer--not simply doing something for someone else, but helping them to realize what they can accomplish on their own.  That's what we're about: raising people up in dignity, speaking life and encouragement over them, and providing them with resources for future success and wellbeing.  </p>
<p>We are also going to Thailand as learners, recognizing that there is so much that we can learn from the experts within these communities about providing education and community health in a different cultural context.  This will be an invaluable lesson for us and will shape us in our future goals of international community development.</p>

Hello, I'm Gerry Steinhauer, one of the Directors of EyePAT. We are a not for profit Community Interest Company and are dedicated to keeping children, young people, vulnerable
adults and adults safe online and free from bullying.
The
 film that you have just watched graphically illustrates the impact that
 bullying and in particular cyberbullying can have. Our workshops deal 
with these issues in schools across the UK and our campaign, if it 
reaches it's target, will take over 5000 children out of the firing line.
We intend to provide 60 free anti bullying workshops to schools across the UK during Anti Bullying week 18th to 22nd November 2013.

Why run this campaign
Currently 49% of children will be bullied during their school lives. It is estimated that at  least 20 children and adolescents a  year
 commit suicide because of being bullied – this is a conservative  
estimate based on documented cases known to BeatBullying. It is likely that the 
actual  number is higher, perhaps much higher. (These figures also do 
not take into  account the numbers of young people who attempt suicide 
but survive.)According to the National Bullying Survey, more than half of  those who reported being bullied had been physically  hurt (parents report over 71%); 34% of those physically hurt required  attention from a doctor or hospital.  3% of the attacks involved a weapon.


All of the above children have one thing in common, they have all taken their own lives and their deaths are linked to chronic bullying.
The Impact
Happy Kids Don’t Bully workshops are the missing link in anti bullying strategies. 
Schools current strategies contain :

What bullying is
Why bullying is wrong
The need to take action to report it if you see it
Support for victims using many resources
Specialised support staff
Peer mentoring / bully buddies
Counselling services
Suspension or exclusion

The missing link is: Why does the bully bully?Which is why our program was created.
Its purpose is to get to the root of the problem...... to find out why the bully is bullying and then get them the help they need to stop. We achieve this by allowing the entire group to explore bullying as a concept, the reasons that a bully may have for being one and identifying ways for helping the bully deal with these reasons.  
By the end of the workshop the group as a whole will be aware of why the bully they have been afraid of is doing what they do and how to help them to stop. This is not a pity party and definitely not an easy ride for the bully. They have been made to confront (without being identified) their own background situation, have seen their power over the group disappear and potentially discovered why they act as they do.
If you don’t have a bully you don’t have any victims!!
Happy Kids Don't Bully workshops make it much more difficult for a bully to operate!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>What's up? My name is Kristopher Johnson, and I'm from Fairfax County, VA. I'm the Founder/Creative Director of T.M.E.S. (The Movement Entrepreneur Society). My company is inspired by every thing that I love, and turning those things into a business. I'm driven by hip-hop, success, fashion, and especially seeing those around me succeed. My main talent is seeing the talent in others, and motivating them to start pursuing their passion. I believe one should do what they love, and love what they do.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>My program is 100% free for all creative high school students that want to get into the entertainment industry. These young people could be anything from aspiring recording artists and video directors, all the way to amazing graphic artists. Or, simply a kid who just wants to start their own fashion label. The goal behind our campaign, which I'm calling, ""Access Granted,"" is to raise money for computers/laptops (for our graphic designers), music equipment (microphones, speakers, etc.), and to upgrade our studio for professional quality. In the end, we'll have dozens of kids working in synergy. Our young graphic designers will be designing the album covers for our young recording artists, and our young photographers will be taking photos at the parties our young promoters will be hosting. It's simply genius. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>With my team of business partners behind me, we want to do an amazing thing for our community. The program will be broken up into 4 different departments: ""Business Arts,"" ""Recording Arts,"" ""Creative Arts,"" and ""Marketing."" Let me break down a little more exactly how it's going to work:<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<ol>
<li> <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Business Arts</span> - I will lead this portion of the program. I'll be working with participants who all have a different goal to obtain, but which coincides with the entertainment industry. These participants will include party promoters, talent managers, participants that are looking to start their own record label, or even a magazine. I will help them construct a business plan, and give them real life experience by working with the ""Recording Arts,"" and ""Creative Arts"" departments. I will guide the party promoters, and show them how to book venues, and work out profit splits with club owners. I'll oversee them, but allow them to plan, market, and promote on their own. I already have a great knowledge in doing this, and here's an example: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdnqycZ0Hzw"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdnqycZ0Hzw</a>. Recap: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_profilepage&amp;v=JqHQyKhnfZIfeature=related"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_pro...</a><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Recording Arts</span> - This section will be led by Richard ""Lyricks"" Lee, and Kyle Higgenbothom. Lyricks is the owner of the ""SuperNova"" studio in Fairax, VA, which we will be running our program out of. He is a phenomenal music artist, whom which has been on tour with the famous rap group, Wu-Tang Clan. Kyle is the lead vocalist for the band ""Footwork,"" and both of these teammates are also from Fairfax County, VA. They will be working with a mixture of young musicians, music producers, disc jockeys, and audio engineers. They will help guide the producers to make the most professional sounding beats possible, further allowing them to choose the best options for their album. They will guide the engineers to do all of the post-production work to make the album sound as crisp and clean as possible. At the end of the program, they will put together a showcase for all of the artists to perform on a stage, and release their material to their peers. As a team, we will also hold workshops with the connections that all of the T.M.E.S. directors have in the area. These workshops will consist of bringing out artists who are already established in the entertainment industry to talk about their story, and what it took for them to make a name for themselves. *For more information on Lyricks, please visit <a href=""http://www.writelyricks.com/*"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.writelyricks.com/*</a>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Creative Arts</span> - Collin ""C.O."" O'Brien will be the head here. C.O. is the Owner/Creative Director, and photographer at ""Clockwise Clothing."" Another Northern Virginia resident, and James Madison University graduate, C.O. will be working with teens that have interests ranging from graphic design, illustration, fashion design, video editing, and photography. He'll help edit/shoot videos, design logos, and much more. Working with the ""Recording Arts"" program, he'll help build portfolios and gather an ideal amount of material, which will either help participants start up their own business, or help them apply for work/school in their desired craft. *For more information on C.O., please visit <a href=""http://clockwiseclothing.com/mens.htm*"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://clockwiseclothing.com/mens.htm*</a><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Marketing</span> - To make sure we're getting the word out properly, there's no better way than to have the social media scene covered. Brandon ""B-Wall"" Wallace will be in charge of this task. Between Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and sites such as IndieGoGo, he plans on making sure that these specific forms of communication are taken care of. Updating our audience with the latest information about our artists, events, and news, will be his main focus. B-Wall is the Chief Branding Designer at <a href=""http://www.bwall.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.bwall.com/</a>.<br/>
</li>
</ol>
<p><br/></p>
<p>When it's all said and done, we will showcase all of our artists by having them put on a full performance, and also have copies of their newly packaged CD's available to the public. We will have the Creative Arts department design the flyers, shoot the promotional videos for the finale ceremony, as well as the recap video. We will have the Business Arts department plan the entire show, as well as find the venue, and promote the entire concert/graduation. <br/><font size=""2""><span style=""font-family: arial;""></span></font></p>
<p>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><b style=""""><span style='font-family: ""Times New Roman"",""serif"";'><br/></span></b></p>

We are all great friends, and I really feel like we have the best team in the area. We want to give young people an opportunity to follow their dreams, and create a platform where they can succeed. We want to show them that if you believe in yourself, anything is possible. There's more to life than sex, drugs, alcohol, and a 9-5 job. We're ready to work with these young people, and put our city on the map like never before. We will focus on the D.C., Maryland and Virginia area, and our start date target is January 1, 2012. Join us in this movement, help us change lives, and let's start giving back to the future.<br/><p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact we will be making is simple, yet monumental. We're giving talented young people an opportunity to use their abilities that they have been blessed with. There is countless amounts of talent in our community, yet not enough people willing to help guide it. This is a chance for kids to make something of themselves, while it's also an opportunity for everyone else to support the youth, and tomorrow's leaders.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The last thing we want to do is crush a child's dream. If we do not succeed with this campaign, all of our efforts to help groom these children will be shattered. We won't have the necessary tools to help these kids, and nobody wins in the long run. Help us help them, so that we all succeed.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As I briefly mentioned above, we're looking to raise money for computers, laptops/refurbished iMacs, a conference table, chairs/stools, Final Cut Pro software, Photoshop software, Pro Tools software, cameras, microphones, speakers, money to rent out venues for our performers, etc. All of this will be put directly into the company, and used to help develop our young participants. The computers will be for our graphic artists, the microphones will be for our recording artists, and so on. If we do not reach our entire goal, we're also looking into other sites such as Indiegogo.com. We want to make sure that we raise enough money to have the tools necessary to support the kids. We won't stop until we reach our goal.<br/></p>

</div></div>","Our Story
What's up? My name is Kristopher Johnson, and I'm from Fairfax County, VA. I'm the Founder/Creative Director of T.M.E.S. (The Movement Entrepreneur Society). My company is inspired by every thing that I love, and turning those things into a business. I'm driven by hip-hop, success, fashion, and especially seeing those around me succeed. My main talent is seeing the talent in others, and motivating them to start pursuing their passion. I believe one should do what they love, and love what they do.

My program is 100% free for all creative high school students that want to get into the entertainment industry. These young people could be anything from aspiring recording artists and video directors, all the way to amazing graphic artists. Or, simply a kid who just wants to start their own fashion label. The goal behind our campaign, which I'm calling, ""Access Granted,"" is to raise money for computers/laptops (for our graphic designers), music equipment (microphones, speakers, etc.), and to upgrade our studio for professional quality. In the end, we'll have dozens of kids working in synergy. Our young graphic designers will be designing the album covers for our young recording artists, and our young photographers will be taking photos at the parties our young promoters will be hosting. It's simply genius. 

With my team of business partners behind me, we want to do an amazing thing for our community. The program will be broken up into 4 different departments: ""Business Arts,"" ""Recording Arts,"" ""Creative Arts,"" and ""Marketing."" Let me break down a little more exactly how it's going to work:


 Business Arts - I will lead this portion of the program. I'll be working with participants who all have a different goal to obtain, but which coincides with the entertainment industry. These participants will include party promoters, talent managers, participants that are looking to start their own record label, or even a magazine. I will help them construct a business plan, and give them real life experience by working with the ""Recording Arts,"" and ""Creative Arts"" departments. I will guide the party promoters, and show them how to book venues, and work out profit splits with club owners. I'll oversee them, but allow them to plan, market, and promote on their own. I already have a great knowledge in doing this, and here's an example: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BdnqycZ0Hzw. Recap: http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_pro...


Recording Arts - This section will be led by Richard ""Lyricks"" Lee, and Kyle Higgenbothom. Lyricks is the owner of the ""SuperNova"" studio in Fairax, VA, which we will be running our program out of. He is a phenomenal music artist, whom which has been on tour with the famous rap group, Wu-Tang Clan. Kyle is the lead vocalist for the band ""Footwork,"" and both of these teammates are also from Fairfax County, VA. They will be working with a mixture of young musicians, music producers, disc jockeys, and audio engineers. They will help guide the producers to make the most professional sounding beats possible, further allowing them to choose the best options for their album. They will guide the engineers to do all of the post-production work to make the album sound as crisp and clean as possible. At the end of the program, they will put together a showcase for all of the artists to perform on a stage, and release their material to their peers. As a team, we will also hold workshops with the connections that all of the T.M.E.S. directors have in the area. These workshops will consist of bringing out artists who are already established in the entertainment industry to talk about their story, and what it took for them to make a name for themselves. *For more information on Lyricks, please visit http://www.writelyricks.com/*


Creative Arts - Collin ""C.O."" O'Brien will be the head here. C.O. is the Owner/Creative Director, and photographer at ""Clockwise Clothing."" Another Northern Virginia resident, and James Madison University graduate, C.O. will be working with teens that have interests ranging from graphic design, illustration, fashion design, video editing, and photography. He'll help edit/shoot videos, design logos, and much more. Working with the ""Recording Arts"" program, he'll help build portfolios and gather an ideal amount of material, which will either help participants start up their own business, or help them apply for work/school in their desired craft. *For more information on C.O., please visit http://clockwiseclothing.com/mens.htm*


Marketing - To make sure we're getting the word out properly, there's no better way than to have the social media scene covered. Brandon ""B-Wall"" Wallace will be in charge of this task. Between Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and sites such as IndieGoGo, he plans on making sure that these specific forms of communication are taken care of. Updating our audience with the latest information about our artists, events, and news, will be his main focus. B-Wall is the Chief Branding Designer at http://www.bwall.com/.



When it's all said and done, we will showcase all of our artists by having them put on a full performance, and also have copies of their newly packaged CD's available to the public. We will have the Creative Arts department design the flyers, shoot the promotional videos for the finale ceremony, as well as the recap video. We will have the Business Arts department plan the entire show, as well as find the venue, and promote the entire concert/graduation. 




We are all great friends, and I really feel like we have the best team in the area. We want to give young people an opportunity to follow their dreams, and create a platform where they can succeed. We want to show them that if you believe in yourself, anything is possible. There's more to life than sex, drugs, alcohol, and a 9-5 job. We're ready to work with these young people, and put our city on the map like never before. We will focus on the D.C., Maryland and Virginia area, and our start date target is January 1, 2012. Join us in this movement, help us change lives, and let's start giving back to the future.

The Impact
The impact we will be making is simple, yet monumental. We're giving talented young people an opportunity to use their abilities that they have been blessed with. There is countless amounts of talent in our community, yet not enough people willing to help guide it. This is a chance for kids to make something of themselves, while it's also an opportunity for everyone else to support the youth, and tomorrow's leaders.

The last thing we want to do is crush a child's dream. If we do not succeed with this campaign, all of our efforts to help groom these children will be shattered. We won't have the necessary tools to help these kids, and nobody wins in the long run. Help us help them, so that we all succeed.


What We Need & What You Get
As I briefly mentioned above, we're looking to raise money for computers, laptops/refurbished iMacs, a conference table, chairs/stools, Final Cut Pro software, Photoshop software, Pro Tools software, cameras, microphones, speakers, money to rent out venues for our performers, etc. All of this will be put directly into the company, and used to help develop our young participants. The computers will be for our graphic artists, the microphones will be for our recording artists, and so on. If we do not reach our entire goal, we're also looking into other sites such as Indiegogo.com. We want to make sure that we raise enough money to have the tools necessary to support the kids. We won't stop until we reach our goal.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><br/>The youth have been meeting together for over 15 years. We want a space the kids [(7th through 12th graders)] can call their own. A place where they can associate, and bring friends. We currently do not have a space. Our renovation consists of refurbishing the bottom of a school house located in Amesbury, MA. Right now, the space is crowded with old flooring, old couches, tacky paint, and moldy smells. We want to raise $13,000 dollars to put in new flooring, create a built-in stage, and add new couches, TV displays, and entertainment such as a foosball table. We are also going to be  kicking off the new space with a battle of he bands contest. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>Our goal is to reach out to the ""at risk"" kids in Amsbury, MA and to break the cycle of violence, drugs, and lack of education. Our hope is to build relationships using the arts to give them someone they can look up to and give them a hope for the future.  We also plan on using the space for our current youth group. This space would alow us to put on more events as well as give the kids a place where the can call there own.  If this project does not go forward the ""at risk"" would have no place where the could go where they could feel safe and they will fall into the same cycle that they have been living in their whole lives. <br/><br/><p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $13,000 This amount covers the cost of paint, flooring, Computer, stage, sound equipment, and Displays.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>If you are unable to give financially but still  want to help we could use help with volunteer labor over the summer<br/>you can also let other people know about this project. <br/>

<p>    Greetings, I am Dr. Augustus William Jordan III. By trade I am an English and Humanities Professor at the College level currently working and residing in Atlanta, Georgia. However, I am not your average educator because I use various aspects of Popular Culture in order to reach and motivate my students.</p>
<p>     In this particular campaign ""I Wear The Mask,"" I am raising money in order to fund a staff development trip to the 1st Global Conference: The Graphic Novel this September in Oxford, United Kingdom. At this conference, I am scheduled to present a paper called ""The Spectacular Swaggerman"" which entails my inspiration as a young African-American male through idenitifying with the Marvel Comics Icon, Spiderman. Although the character's alter ego is Caucasian, my research delves into numerous aspects which enhanced my interest in the adventures of this ""household name"" in literary fiction. In this conference, I will also observe and exchange ideas with other educators like myself who have an intense interest in comic books and/or graphic novels.</p>
<p>     What I feel this conference will do for me is allow me to share my experiences on Multi-modal education methods with those of various individuals from around the world. This type of education, I feel, is invaluable because it uses entertainment to increase various learning centers in the conceptuality of our youth. For example, my paper ""Spectacular Swaggerman"" delves into the Spiderman story motto, ""With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility"". Although this is a term that can be furthered into other genres without regard to entertainment, the fascination with comic books for a youth tends to make the learning experience fun as well.</p>
<p>     As a contributor, I feel that you will help me to further my knowledge of teaching using multimodal techniques as well as spread the knowledge of these skills to others from various continents of the world. What better way would there be to increase a pupil's knowledge than to make it entertaining.</p>
<p>     The funding needed for this project will mainly go towards my travel and lodging to the United Kingdom. Due to cuts in education, I have been unsuccesful at acquiring any funds from my employers under the category of staff development, so your funding would help me immensely.  In return I have various campaign perks which I feel will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>     Even if I do not reach my $2500 goal by the deadline, the funds raised in this campaign will again be used towards travel and lodging. However, should we exceed, the monetary goal, the better the experience of my trip will be for those in attendance, for example, upgraded multi-media resources. To get an idea of some of my other conferences in which I've presented, The Hawaii International Conference on Education of 2008 is the prefect example that can be seen on Youtube. Although the topic of my paper for that conference was ""A Narrative Analysis in the Chosen Literary Works of the Rapper Nas,"" the presentation is the perfect example of a successful staff development trip funded by a secondary institution as well as a presentation using multi-modular education techniques. Unfortunately, due to budget cuts, all staff development funding has been eliminated at all of my institutions.</p>
<p>     Yes I realize that times are hard now friends, however, if you are in a position in which you cannot support me monetarily, vocal support for my cause would be fine. Spreading the word will definitely help me to raise my goal. However, if 100 of my close friends all donated $25, I could exceed my goal. Those of you who know me, realize that on Facebook alone, I have 1000 plus friends of which more than 75% I know personally. This is where my pen name ""6 Degrees"" comes from.  In closing, use the Indiegogog ""share"" tool to post the campaign on as many pages of your friends as possible. Also, thanks in advance for your help in any way shape or form that I receive it.</p>

<p>My name is Bradley Carleton. I am hoping that my story might appeal to those of you who believe that nature heals the soul. Here is my story.</p>
<p>Nine years ago I accepted a challenge that would change my life. I began mentoring a young man near my home town here in Vermont. I had no idea the impact that one individual could have on another's life. The experience served to be a life altering catalyst for me.</p>
<p>I had always tried to do things ""by me, for me, through me"" and had failed so many times that I no longer took my dreams seriously. Recognizing that I could not seem to achieve ""my"" dreams, I began searching for my purpose. Through a lot of time spent outdoors, hunting, fishing and foraging, I learned that I have a gift for sharing my love of nature with others. Soon I figured out that my purpose was to serve others by sharing our connection to nature to heal our spirits.</p>
<p><span style="""">I continued mentoring for the next eight years and eventually designed a curriculum of traditional outdoor pursuits, whereby my mentees could wage battle against their adolescent demons, and found that they all had one thing in common; ""nature deficit disorder"" as defined by Richard Louv in his book ""Last Child in the Woods"". These young men had all lacked a connection to nature. </span></p>
<p><span style="""">Through hunting, fishing and the art of foraging it has been proven that our connection to nature develops respect, compassion and empathy, and without that connection, a child will often mature without those characteristics, or at the very least, have a poorly developed appreciation for life.</span></p>
<p>  <img alt="""" class=""spotlight lazy"" data-src=""https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/299869_263592236985314_8263353_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style="""">For the past eight years I have mentored six young men who lacked a male role model and struggled with social skills in their journey to manhood. I have seen such dramatic changes in these young men that I was driven to establish a non-profit organization (still in the process of getting tax-exempt status from the IRS) to raise funds for the program. Through Traditions Outdoor Mentoring.org, the educational arm of Sacred Hunter.org, we teach them to hunt, fish and forage and to learn respect and empathy for the resources that nurture their spirit.</span></p>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""spotlight lazy"" data-src=""https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc7/298318_263591660318705_5474037_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I was recently contacted by one of our old mentees and was told that ""more than any other person in his life, our mentoring relationship had the most impact on his life."" He had gone from a gang candidate to a young responsible father holding down multiple jobs in accepting his responsibility for his choices. Another mentee is currently serving in the Marines in Afghanistan, and we are very proud of his desire to serve his country. One of our current mentees is learning grace and humility through the art of fly-fishing. All of the young men we've worked with have had profound life-changing shifts in their adolescent consciousness from self-involved to charitable, from angry anti-social behaviors to respectful, self-confident young men, from ""takers"" to ""givers.""</p>
<p>Our program has been tremendously successful because of the genuine concern of those who have been involved as mentors and assistants.</p>
<p><span style="""">I enlisted a few friends who devote a lot of time and care to working with our at-risk boys, We brought John Lesher and Chris Thayer on to our Board of Directors in April and, along with my wife, Katie Carleton, we have grown a grass-roots program into a focused organization.</span></p>
<p><span style="""">We recently accepted Randall Eaton, PhD, author of ""The Sacred Hunt - Hunting as a Sacred Path"" and ""From Boys To Men of Heart - Hunting as a Rite of Passage"" on to our Board of Directors and are very pleased to have Mr. Eaton as a guide and brother in our mission.</span></p>
<p><span style=""""><img alt=""Boys To Men"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i99.photobucket.com/albums/l297/bcarleton/boystomencover.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></span></p>
<p><span style="""">I am deeply committed to this path and am finding that when I pursue my authentic purpose, things naturally develop and grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="""">Our next step is to raise enough money to fund our programs. We need funds for youth-sized equipment (youth-sized bow &amp; arrow kits, fishing rods, waders, decoys, blinds, calls, clothing, etc). for our young men. </span></p>
<p><span style="""">We are proud to be a Vermont corporation, and in honor of the independent nature of our state, we are offering some very special Vermont-made perks through our partner, Dakin Farms. </span></p>
<p><span style="""">If you've never had real Vermont maple syrup, cob-smoked bacon or a Lumberjack Breakfast, here's your chance! We are offering several levels of perks and ALL of them represent the natural wonder and beauty that is Vermont. We are sure you will be pleased with the time-honored Vermont tradition of quality foods that Dakin Farms offers.</span></p>
<p><img alt=""Lumberjack Breakfast"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i99.photobucket.com/albums/l297/bcarleton/lumberjack.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Lumberjack Breakfast""/></p>
<p>Note: We are not a tax-exempt organization (yet) so your donation will not be tax-deductible at this time. Hopefully our IRS form 1023 submission for tax-exempt status will return a favorable Letter of Determination in the next 6-9 months. Your donation will help us until that happens. </p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration and please feel free to visit our Facebook pages, Sacred Hunter.org and Traditions Outdoor Mentoring.org and ""like"" us if you do!. Please feel free to visit our websites, Sacred Hunter.org and Traditions Outdoor Mentoring.org. </p>
<p>Also, please, if you are an anti-hunter, be respectful and know that we practice spirituality in this program. This is about love, respect, compassion and learning to nurture our bodies with the animal spirits.  We all have the freedom to practice our own methods of connecting with our Higher Power.</p>

Soon I figured out that my purpose was to serve others by sharing our connection to nature to heal our spirits.
I continued mentoring for the next eight years and eventually designed a curriculum of traditional outdoor pursuits, whereby my mentees could wage battle against their adolescent demons, and found that they all had one thing in common; ""nature deficit disorder"" as defined by Richard Louv in his book ""Last Child in the Woods"". These young men had all lacked a connection to nature. 
Through hunting, fishing and the art of foraging it has been proven that our connection to nature develops respect, compassion and empathy, and without that connection, a child will often mature without those characteristics, or at the very least, have a poorly developed appreciation for life.
  
For the past eight years I have mentored six young men who lacked a male role model and struggled with social skills in their journey to manhood. I have seen such dramatic changes in these young men that I was driven to establish a non-profit organization (still in the process of getting tax-exempt status from the IRS) to raise funds for the program. Through Traditions Outdoor Mentoring.org, the educational arm of Sacred Hunter.org, we teach them to hunt, fish and forage and to learn respect and empathy for the resources that nurture their spirit.
 
I was recently contacted by one of our old mentees and was told that ""more than any other person in his life, our mentoring relationship had the most impact on his life."" He had gone from a gang candidate to a young responsible father holding down multiple jobs in accepting his responsibility for his choices. Another mentee is currently serving in the Marines in Afghanistan, and we are very proud of his desire to serve his country. One of our current mentees is learning grace and humility through the art of fly-fishing. All of the young men we've worked with have had profound life-changing shifts in their adolescent consciousness from self-involved to charitable, from angry anti-social behaviors to respectful, self-confident young men, from ""takers"" to ""givers.""
Our program has been tremendously successful because of the genuine concern of those who have been involved as mentors and assistants.
I enlisted a few friends who devote a lot of time and care to working with our at-risk boys, We brought John Lesher and Chris Thayer on to our Board of Directors in April and, along with my wife, Katie Carleton, we have grown a grass-roots program into a focused organization.
We recently accepted Randall Eaton, PhD, author of ""The Sacred Hunt - Hunting as a Sacred Path"" and ""From Boys To Men of Heart - Hunting as a Rite of Passage"" on to our Board of Directors and are very pleased to have Mr. Eaton as a guide and brother in our mission.

I am deeply committed to this path and am finding that when I pursue my authentic purpose, things naturally develop and grow.
Our next step is to raise enough money to fund our programs. We need funds for youth-sized equipment (youth-sized bow & arrow kits, fishing rods, waders, decoys, blinds, calls, clothing, etc). for our young men. 
We are proud to be a Vermont corporation, and in honor of the independent nature of our state, we are offering some very special Vermont-made perks through our partner, Dakin Farms. 
If you've never had real Vermont maple syrup, cob-smoked bacon or a Lumberjack Breakfast, here's your chance! We are offering several levels of perks and ALL of them represent the natural wonder and beauty that is Vermont. We are sure you will be pleased with the time-honored Vermont tradition of quality foods that Dakin Farms offers.

Note: We are not a tax-exempt organization (yet) so your donation will not be tax-deductible at this time. Hopefully our IRS form 1023 submission for tax-exempt status will return a favorable Letter of Determination in the next 6-9 months. Your donation will help us until that happens. 
Thank you for your consideration and please feel free to visit our Facebook pages, Sacred Hunter.org and Traditions Outdoor Mentoring.org and ""like"" us if you do!. Please feel free to visit our websites, Sacred Hunter.org and Traditions Outdoor Mentoring.org. 
Also, please, if you are an anti-hunter, be respectful and know that we practice spirituality in this program. This is about love, respect, compassion and learning to nurture our bodies with the animal spirits.  We all have the freedom to practice our own methods of connecting with our Higher Power.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Tae Kwon Do for The Kids, The Community and The Future</h3>
<p>My name is Sharon Wheeler and I have lived in Chicago's 27th ward, the Near North community for over 18 years and I love the art of Tae Kwon Do.  My entire family participates in the practice of Tae Kwon Do.  My husband and two oldest boys age 14 and 13 are black belts and my youngest son age 7 is a brown belt.  I too have just earned my black belt after practicing for over four years under the instruction of Master Blair Sarkiss at the H.M.D. Academy of Tae Kwon Do in Chicago.</p>
<p>Our community is one of the nation's most diverse and we have seen many changes occur.  In our neighborhood where the Cabrini Green projects used to stand a Target Store is being built.  The landscape is changing, but the people are still here and trying to live together in harmony.  Many low income families live in section 8 and subsidized housing in the area. There are still invisible gang lines that prevent children from crossing Division Street and Clybourn Ave. to gain access to park facilities.  </p>
<p>Last year I began teaching an afterschool Tae Kwon Do program at the local elementary school where 97% of the student population qualifies for free lunch.  We met for two 10 week sessions twice a week where the kids learned Tae Kwon Do but also an understanding of how it makes us strong in our minds and emotions too.  Sixteen children succeeded in earning their yellow belts!  </p>
<p>Chicago Public Schools (CPS) slated this elementary school as one to be closed in it's campaign to save money.  The administration, parents, community and Alderman succeeded in saving their school.  We would like to build bonds beyond gang turf lines through Tae Kwon Do.  The kids should be able to relate to each other and see each other as friends and neighbors.</p>
<p>We would like an opportunity to continue this afterschool program for three semesters in the 2013-2014 school year.  Our goal is that the children can continue to gain rank and for more kids to experience the benefits gained from the practice of Tae Kwon Do. In addition, we would like to offer an afterschool program at a second elementary school that is located across the Gang line in an attempt to 'bridge the gap' of undersanding and foster peace with the children using Tae Kwon Do as a vehicle for shared experience.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>It costs (instructors and liability insurance) $10 per child per class.  We would like to be able to offer Tae Kwon Do to 20 children at each school.</p>
<p>Each school will have instruction for each semester (Fall, Winter, Spring) we will teach three 10 week sessions, two classes per week - 60 classes at each school - 120 classes in total. This cost equals $24,000.  We will donate the children's uniforms at a one time cost of $45 per child.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal we will still teach the afterschool programs although we will not be able to reach as many kids.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">The Impact</span></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The skills the children learn in after school Tae Kwon Do will carry over to their daily lives and help them handle all types of situations.  It will allow them to make good decisions in school, family and social situations.  We teach them what it takes to be successful and what integrity means, responsibiltiy, self discipline and why these traits are important.  </p>
<p>This program is about more than kicking and punching, it is about becoming a strong person physically, mentally and emotionally.  It provides lifelong skills in managing confrontation, improving school performance, and broadening his/her sense of accomplishment.  Tae Kwon Do will promote leadership and create a community of leaders that will create good will through the general population of their schools and hopefully create a new generation of youth whose goal is peace and understanding.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p align=""left"">In a typical year more than 200 children move through the court system in Ohio, Marshall, Wetzel and Tyler Counties of West Virginia.  These children have been removed from their home through no fault of their own.  Their families are in crisis.  But the system is ill equipped to assure a child’s basic needs and rights are being protected. Too often a child can be placed in a different home from his sisters or brothers.  Too often a single child can move to three or five foster homes in merely a matter of a year or two.  Too often a child can languish for years without finding a stable home, only to ultimately “age out” of the system.</p>
<p align=""left"">Our solution to such injustice begins with a single volunteer.  More than a mentor or a special buddy.  This volunteer is a Court Appointed Special Advocate, a “CASA volunteer.”  Someone specially trained to know what is in a child’s best interest, and how to get those interests met by the system.  Who knows how to help a child through his time of great vulnerability. A deeply committed adult.  A person who will fight for this child, against all odds, against power, against bureaucracy and shortsighted agendas.  Fight until that child understands that he has a right to believe in himself.  Fight, until she can understand and advocate for her own inalienable rights.  To live a life of destiny, rather than fate.</p>
<h3>
<br/>What We Need</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>CASA for Children Inc., a tax exempt non-profit agency is a volunteer based organization in Moundsville, West Virginia and serves four counties in the northern panhandle of West Virginia.  CASA has been advocating on behalf of abused and neglected children since 2001, in Ohio County and expanded in 2003 to Marshall County.  In 2010, CASA expanded again to Wetzel and Tyler Counties.</p>
<p>Our office operates with a full time director and one part-time volunteer coordinator. These 2 people recruit, train and supervise volunteers.

Because of CASA; 291 children have found their way to safe home.  CASA is the only program of its kind.  In the child welfare and family court systems, it was – and is – nothing short of a transformation.  Everything is built around one child and one compassionate, highly trained adult advocate for that child.</p>

<p>Thank you for taking the time to read about our program. Lift up a child's voice. A child's life.</p></div>","Short Summary
In a typical year more than 200 children move through the court system in Ohio, Marshall, Wetzel and Tyler Counties of West Virginia.  These children have been removed from their home through no fault of their own.  Their families are in crisis.  But the system is ill equipped to assure a child’s basic needs and rights are being protected. Too often a child can be placed in a different home from his sisters or brothers.  Too often a single child can move to three or five foster homes in merely a matter of a year or two.  Too often a child can languish for years without finding a stable home, only to ultimately “age out” of the system.
Our solution to such injustice begins with a single volunteer.  More than a mentor or a special buddy.  This volunteer is a Court Appointed Special Advocate, a “CASA volunteer.”  Someone specially trained to know what is in a child’s best interest, and how to get those interests met by the system.  Who knows how to help a child through his time of great vulnerability. A deeply committed adult.  A person who will fight for this child, against all odds, against power, against bureaucracy and shortsighted agendas.  Fight until that child understands that he has a right to believe in himself.  Fight, until she can understand and advocate for her own inalienable rights.  To live a life of destiny, rather than fate.

What We Need


CASA for Children Inc., a tax exempt non-profit agency is a volunteer based organization in Moundsville, West Virginia and serves four counties in the northern panhandle of West Virginia.  CASA has been advocating on behalf of abused and neglected children since 2001, in Ohio County and expanded in 2003 to Marshall County.  In 2010, CASA expanded again to Wetzel and Tyler Counties.
Our office operates with a full time director and one part-time volunteer coordinator. These 2 people recruit, train and supervise volunteers. CASA volunteers help the Judge determine permanent placement for a child.  If the child does not have an advocate this process can take a long time. The hope is that with a volunteer’s help, a decision about what is in the best interest of the child can be expedited, so as not to linger in the system for years.
The most important support we receive is our volunteers who devote time.  But we can still only reach around 70% of the kids in our community.  This robs children of the life they deserve, and has a profound impact on our community and society’s future.  If we help one child, we set a positive course for generations. Money raised would be used to offset the cost of recruitment, training and supervision of volunteers. We would be able to ensure that enough volunteers are trained to meet the need and that we can expand our volunteer base to reflect the diversity and cultural makeup of children in the system.  We would also be able to concentrate our efforts on creating a critical mass of support to put child advocacy where it rightfully belongs in our social conscience.
For the first time in 12 years, our program is looking at the very real possiblity that we may shut our doors.  That means 145 children without a CASA advocating for their needs. We are just 4 weeks away from closing down the center.  We need your support to keep our doors open until July 1 when our next grant cycle begins.  Federal and state grant dollars are being cut.

<p>Beginning August 4th, I will be headed to Antigua, Guatemala for a month to volunteer in an after school program in a poor rural town outside of Antigua.  While I'm there, I hope to make a small contribution to the lives of these children by giving them a basic introduction to photography, sharing my passion for the medium, and encouraging their individual creative expression. With your help, I plan to supply approximately 20 to 30 children between the ages of 8-14 with cameras, and allow each child the means to edit their photos and make prints to keep for themselves. </p>
<h2>Where Does the Money Go? :</h2>
<h3>60 disposable Fuji film cameras - $300</h3>
<h3>Film processing &amp; printing (approx. $15 per camera) - $900</h3>
<p>The budget breakdown is very simple. I've already purchased 60 disposable cameras, which I'll be taking with me to Guatemala. Regardless if I come up short of my fundraising goal, I'm going to make this happen, even if I have to throw it on my credit card. I am by no means a wealthy person, which is why I'm asking for your help.</p>
<p>No, your money will not go my airfare or program expenses for the volunteership. It's all going to the kids. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, the program sponsor, Maximo Nivel, does not presently have the means finance this project. Their humanitarian budget for the month of August has already been allocated to specific projects, mostly involving the purchase of medical supplies and educational materials. </p>
<h2>Project Goals</h2>
<p>The main thing I want to do is simply to inspire these kids in a fun and creative way. I remember very well the first camera I had when I was about 12, and how excited I was to see the images I was able to create. Those experiences left an indelible impression on me. I hope to impart the same feelings of excitement and accomplishment onto these children. </p>
<p>If all goes well, and this project is a success, who knows what may happen. There are many organizations that use photography as a means to empower disadvantaged children that have been very successful (ie: <a href=""http://www.kids-with-cameras.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.kids-with-cameras.org</a>). I would love to see that photography continues to be a part of these kids lives well after I'm gone. </p>
<p>If you're interested in this project, please stay in touch with me. If possible, I plan to regularly post updates showcasing the children's photographs.</p>

environment in which they can see how their interests and background
can make a distinctive contribution to the discipline. <br/></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>PIKSI alumni have already begun transforming the discipline.

<p>PIKSI
has traditionally received two sources of funding. The program is
housed at the Pennsylvania State University’s Rock Ethics
Institute, who together with Pennsylvania State University School of
Liberal Arts, have pledged to continue their partial financing of
PIKSI, conditional upon funding from a partner organization. Until
recently the American Philosophical Association (APA) has co-funded
PIKSI, but beginning 2014, this is no longer funding we can count on.</p>

or the Philosophy in an Inclusive Key Summer Institute, has been helping students from underrepresented groups develop the skills, confidence, and community needed to pursue graduate study in philosophy. Our students include women, people of color, LGBT individuals, individuals with disabilities, and people from economically disadvantaged communities. PIKSI aims to change philosophy's status as the least diverse in the humanities. Only 16% of full-time academic philosophers are women. Of the 13,000 professional philosophers in the United States, only 156 are black. The experiences of members of diverse groups can cast new light on traditional philosophical questions as well as raise new ones.PIKSI selects talented undergraduate students from underrepresented groups out of a pool of applicants who compete to participate in a rigorous eight day summer institute. They learn about graduate school and experience a stimulating and supportive
environment in which they can see how their interests and background
can make a distinctive contribution to the discipline. 

PIKSI alumni have already begun transforming the discipline. They have moved on to various successful endeavors, including graduate studies in philosophy at the masters and doctoral level, and even tenure-track professorships. Why PIKSI Needs Your Help
PIKSI
has traditionally received two sources of funding. The program is
housed at the Pennsylvania State University’s Rock Ethics
Institute, who together with Pennsylvania State University School of
Liberal Arts, have pledged to continue their partial financing of
PIKSI, conditional upon funding from a partner organization. Until
recently the American Philosophical Association (APA) has co-funded
PIKSI, but beginning 2014, this is no longer funding we can count on.

We need your help to keep this important and innovative program going! What Impact You Can Make

Every year 12
undergraduate students are selected from a competitive field of
applicants. We need to raise $13,752 to provide these students with:


transportation to
	and from
	the
	institute;


room
	and board;


meals;


books
	and materials required for the institute; and


a
	small stipend.




In
additional to these, PIKSI incurs other operational costs relating
to:


personnel,
	including PIKSI director and administrative support;


honoraria,
	transportation, and lodging for guest speakers; and


food
	and reception.


Graduate
Assistants are generously supported by their home university
departments.


In
2013, the APA's financial support of $21,000 went a long way to help
with these costs.

This year, we need your help to keep PIKSI going and help change the face of philosophy.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

the past two years, we taught the same group of fourth and fifth graders
at a neighborhood K-5 public charter school near downtown Orlando. 
During this time, we became more than students and teachers-we became a family.</p>
<p>However,
as the end of the school year drew closer, it became clear that our kids were
afraid to move on to middle school. 
In fact, many parents were even afraid to send them.  Why?  Our students were zoned for failing schools with widely known bad reputations.  </p>
<p>These weren't just any kids, these were OUR kids.  We knew their talents.  We knew their dreams.  We knew their potential.  And we knew we had to do something.</p>
<p>So we created a school: The Human Experience.  A private, extended day, extended year middle school in the heart of Orlando.</p>
<p>The Human Experience, however, is so much more than a school.  It a space where students can learn, create, and dream in a family context.  It is a vehicle by which we can explore the ways a school can impact a city, and not the other way around.  It is an exploration of the question, ""What does it mean to be human?""  A question that, if studied nationwide, could change the way we do education forever.</p>
<p>THE Orlando is one of a kind school with amazingly gifted students.  And we need your help to build it.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The school budget for our first year is $385,000.  We have spent the summer designing the school and speaking to private and corporate donors, yet we still need a substantial amount of funding to open the school on time.  All initial funds raised on IndieGoGo will go toward school expenses, which include uniforms, computers, software, school supplies, meals, field trips, books, and library resources.</p>
<p>As part of our model, each parent is required to pay something towards his or her child's education.  We calculate each family's tuition fees using a sliding income scale.  These tuition fees, coupled with funds raised by private and corporate donors, will total $210,000 ($7000 x 30 students).  This means we need to raise an additional $175,000 in order to meet our school goals.</p>
<p>If we raise ___________________, your generous gifts will help us provide:</p>
<p><b>$25,000</b> - Classroom Furniture &amp; Operational Expenses<br/><b>$60,000</b> - Uniforms &amp; Two Classroom Paraprofessionals<br/><b>$84,000</b> - Part Time Office Manager, Educational Software, Teacher Computers, Teacher Cell Phones (teachers will be available for homework calls each night)<br/><b>$99,000</b> - Smart Boards, Mac Pro with Creative Suite Software, Office Copy Machine<br/><b>$125,000</b> - Office Manager (convert to full-time)<br/><b>$155,000</b> - Student Computers, Software, and Student Collaboration Lab Furniture<br/><b>$175,000</b> - Student Field Trips</p>

<ul>
<li>
<i>Empower Students</i>.  Every day, our students will wake up, dress in professional attire, and join the hundreds of movers and shakers that converge on the downtown area.  Each student will become an advocate for his or her family, neighborhood, and community in a place where decisions are traditionally made for them.  They will be empowered, for the rest of their lives, by the knowledge that their voice and their presence carry weight, significance, and impact in the spaces around them. They will discover how they can uniquely add value to the city they call home.<br/><br/>

</div></div>","Our Story The Human Experience (THE) was born from a very real need.  For
the past two years, we taught the same group of fourth and fifth graders
at a neighborhood K-5 public charter school near downtown Orlando. 
During this time, we became more than students and teachers-we became a family.
However,
as the end of the school year drew closer, it became clear that our kids were
afraid to move on to middle school. 
In fact, many parents were even afraid to send them.  Why?  Our students were zoned for failing schools with widely known bad reputations.  
These weren't just any kids, these were OUR kids.  We knew their talents.  We knew their dreams.  We knew their potential.  And we knew we had to do something.
So we created a school: The Human Experience.  A private, extended day, extended year middle school in the heart of Orlando.
The Human Experience, however, is so much more than a school.  It a space where students can learn, create, and dream in a family context.  It is a vehicle by which we can explore the ways a school can impact a city, and not the other way around.  It is an exploration of the question, ""What does it mean to be human?""  A question that, if studied nationwide, could change the way we do education forever.
THE Orlando is one of a kind school with amazingly gifted students.  And we need your help to build it.   What We Need & What You Get The school budget for our first year is $385,000.  We have spent the summer designing the school and speaking to private and corporate donors, yet we still need a substantial amount of funding to open the school on time.  All initial funds raised on IndieGoGo will go toward school expenses, which include uniforms, computers, software, school supplies, meals, field trips, books, and library resources.
As part of our model, each parent is required to pay something towards his or her child's education.  We calculate each family's tuition fees using a sliding income scale.  These tuition fees, coupled with funds raised by private and corporate donors, will total $210,000 ($7000 x 30 students).  This means we need to raise an additional $175,000 in order to meet our school goals.
If we raise ___________________, your generous gifts will help us provide:
$25,000 - Classroom Furniture & Operational Expenses$60,000 - Uniforms & Two Classroom Paraprofessionals$84,000 - Part Time Office Manager, Educational Software, Teacher Computers, Teacher Cell Phones (teachers will be available for homework calls each night)$99,000 - Smart Boards, Mac Pro with Creative Suite Software, Office Copy Machine$125,000 - Office Manager (convert to full-time)$155,000 - Student Computers, Software, and Student Collaboration Lab Furniture$175,000 - Student Field Trips
In return for your financial support, we have created some great Perks for you, including monthly publications, interactive art, personalized songs, a custom Personal Playbook of your own, and much more!



  The Impact Your financial support will:


Empower Students.  Every day, our students will wake up, dress in professional attire, and join the hundreds of movers and shakers that converge on the downtown area.  Each student will become an advocate for his or her family, neighborhood, and community in a place where decisions are traditionally made for them.  They will be empowered, for the rest of their lives, by the knowledge that their voice and their presence carry weight, significance, and impact in the spaces around them. They will discover how they can uniquely add value to the city they call home.

Teach Students to Invest.  The Human Experience strives to not only serve the community, but to also invest in it. We have a shared vision for our city and believe we can contribute to its long-term health and success.  As a school we understand our role in the greater Orlando community, in both the downtown business district and our local neighborhoods.  Students will be encouraged to dream about the future of their city, create solutions to complex problems, and ultimately shape the culture in life-giving ways.  We desire to lay roots in our city’s rich soil, producing stability, protection, and fruit that will benefit its citizens for generations to come.

K. has traveled over 9,307 miles visiting 38 counties and 2 states. S. K. Worm is transported in a trailer modified with a wrap showing a cross section of the state of Ohio starting on the shores of Lake Erie and ending on the banks of the Ohio River. Ohio Geology, Ohio energy sources, and conservation practices are depicted on the trailer.
    Erie Basin RC&D is pleased it has been able to make such a valuable contribution to conservation education through its many outreach projects. In recent years however EBRC&D has experienced the elimination of State and Federal support to the point that Operation Soil Education would not be possible without the generous support of people like you.
Wrap Up
    We understand that you may not be able to make a contribution at this time, but you can still be a big help by making sure your friends and family know about our campaign. 
    Ask not what the soil can do for you but rather what you can do for the soil! Helping fund this campaign would be a great start!
    Remember save a worm, go fly fishing!

<p></p>
<p>The way that we create a brighter future is by providing a space
where kids are not only engaged, but are also challenged to make something from
next to nothing. Whether turning a banana into a keyboard or learning how to
conduct electricity with pink play dough, we empower kids to bring their
imagination into existence within a supportive community that nurtures their

introduced to a world where the possibilities they create can be put into
action. Where there is action, meaningful change can happen. </p>

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>My name is Avril and I am currently teaching English in an after-school programme run by Teach For Palestine in Balata Camp, Nablus, the Occupied Palestinian Territories. There are over 20,000 registered refugees in Balata, making it the most highly populated camp in the West Bank. The camp was founded in 1950 and is approximately 2.5 square kilometres. I teach 3 classes of children aged 7-13 years old. Having taught in France and Ireland already, I can honestly say that these kids have astounded me with their enthusiasm and motivation to learn. Our programme is voluntary and free for the children and they are so excited to come to class everyday! If you want to read more about my English teaching adventures in Balata, please check my blog on <a href=""http://yafainbalata.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://yafainbalata.wordpress.com/</a></p>
<p>Teach for Palestine brings internationally trained teachers to the West Bank to work with kids. TFP’s holistic, interactive approach has proven effective in mentoring students and developing fluency. The average student at TFP acquires 350 new words and advances slightly more than one grade level in reading each semester. After their initial exposure to international teachers, student’s verbal fluency increases exponentially and continues to grow rapidly throughout the program. Moving beyond the classroom, our communicative and compassionate approach draws out and engages children who have suffered from violence, abuse and oppression the better part of their lives. This year, as well as working in Balata, we are also working in New Askar Camp, Salem village and Deir al Hatab village.

<h3>Why am I fundraising?</h3>
<p>My kids have been working very well for the past 6 weeks and I want to reward them with a special treat- a trip to the zoo! There is one zoo in the West Bank, in Qalqilya, which is about 45 minutes from Nablus. My plan is to take them there one Thursday after school to see the animals and maybe have some sweets. I know it sounds like a very simple idea but a lot of these kids have never gone outside of Nablus and the majority have never been to the zoo. We recently learned about animals and they loved the topic- there's a poster of wild animals in the classroom and they look at it before the start of class and tell me all the names. I think they would nearly be sick with excitement to have a zoo trip!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>So what do I want?</h3>
<p>I'm not asking for much! In total, I need to raise about 150-200 euro for this trip ( I already have a donation from my wonderful former students at Gael Cholaiste Chill Dara to put towards this) so I am asking you for the price of a pint...roughly 5 euros. I am very conscious that in these recessionary times people don't have a lot to spare, but if you literally have one drink less the next time you go out, you can give a child a nice day out. These kids get excited when they have a new pen in class so imagine how thrilled they would be to have a trip. The zoo itself isn't expensive, its the transport that is driving up the price- petrol is expensive here.</p>
<p>If you really can't give up your pint, then don't go to Abrakebra/Supermacs/McDonald's after a night out and give me the money instead- good for your waistline and for your soul! Or skip your takeaway coffee, or your pricey magazines, or even your daily chocolate bar for a week and make a donation to me!</p>
<p>If you can give more than 5 euros that would be absolutely amazing...even 1 euro would help! My kids and I would be eternally grateful to you :)</p>

This arts education gave them an opportunity to voice their opinions while improving their English and self esteem. The success of that one program blossomed into what ITLP is today - ITLP has served thousands of children in five developing countries: Tanzania, Rwanda, Ethiopia, South Africa and rural India. With your help, ITLP can return to South Africa this summer.</p>
<p><strong>The Mission:</strong> <br/>ITLP uses theater as a means of social uplift for children in developing nations.  The ITLP theater workshops are designed to inspire new possibilities for children’s lives and foster leadership skills to benefit them and their community and country. With the help of volunteer artist-educators, students write and perform their own original works. Last summer, over the course of 2 weeks, 45 students wrote and performed two original plays about their lives in their township—Philippi, South Africa-- which was then performed for their community.</p>
<p>The students, teacher and parents of Philippi have written to ask us to return. But we need your help!</p>
<p>If we are able to raise $5,000, we can return to South Africa and work with 25 new children for two weeks. Raising $10,000 will provide us the resources to work with 50 students for three weeks.</p>
<p><strong>How Your Money Will Be Used</strong><br/>Every dollar received will go directly to funding the 2013 Philippi workshop. The more you donate, the more children we can work with and the <strong>longer</strong> we can extend our stay.</p>

friends! I am currently in Kenya as a part of a larger global pilgrimage - a journey of
discovery of how I am to serve in these times of change, to bear witness to
what is happening in the world, to connect with humanitarian projects and
to open to a bigger dream. My trip to Kenya weaves three threads. First, I was
invited to co-offer a council training for a peace project, International Peace
Initiatives, where last year friends, mentors and collaborators with Beyond
Boundaries built an earthen peace hut as well as supported a community of listening through sharing the practice of council. Last week Siri Gunnarson and I led a two-day follow up training for the community as well as held an introduction to council for a local women's group. I also came to visit the permaculture projects
of Joseph Lentunyoi, with PRI Kenya (Permaculture Research Institute – Kenya).
Joseph co-taught an inspiring Permaculture Design Course in California this summer with Warren Brush, of Quail Springs Permaculture Farm and Regenerative Earth Farm, where I was asked to share council as a community building practice and in which I participated as a student. I also came to support and
learn from the work of Philip Munyasia, whom I met in 2010 at a peace research community, Tamera, in Portugal, where he was studying permaculture practices and alternative technologies. I was struck by his humility
and dedication as well as his humor and warm-heartedness and we
became allies and friends. </span>    <br/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What Is Being Supported </h3><p>
</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">Philip has the opportunity to attend a permaculture teachers training
course in Kenya taught by my dear friend
and teacher, Warren Brush, who has
been invited by Joseph Lentunyoi and PRI Kenya to offer this training on January 13-17, 2014. This is a great opportunity for
Philip to strengthen his teaching skills and grow his local and international
network in order to serve more people more effectively. It is
also a great opportunity to connect these peace workers who are all dear to me. </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">As all of Philip’s resources - time and money - go directly into his project, I am campaigning to support his participation in this course. </p><p class=""MsoNormal"">The course costs $500, and an additional $200 is needed for transportation and travel expenses. </p><p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">If additional funds come in, they will not be turned away... monies will go toward supporting a tree planting initiative. (PHOTO BELOW: tree nursery at Mt Elgon with another Philip) </p><p class=""MsoNormal""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/243334/files/20131205000346-IMG_3629.JPG?1386230626"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 30px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">What is Being Served</span></p><p></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">In 2007 after completing his education in bio-intensive agriculture in Kenya, Philip received sponsorship to study in California with John Jeavons, author of How to Grow More Vegetables and then to Tamera in Portugal to study permaculture and peace principles. He then returned to his home town and founded OTEPIC (Organic Technology Extension and Promotion of Initiative Center) to empower his community. Philip is a visionary, community catalyst, activist and educator.</p><p class=""MsoNormal"">I have spent some time now with Philip and the OTEPIC community over the past
weeks in his home place of Kitale, in Northwest Kenya. OTEPIC serves and supports many people in the local community, primarily women and youth, providing alternatives for many youth coming out of the slums. OTEPIC has developed two community education centers with demonstration gardens and integrated alternative technologies and is now in the process of visioning and designing a new piece of land to become an inter-tribal peace village - a model for sustainable living, research and training. Every day at any one of the sites, many children and young people are found working in the gardens, feeding the bio-gas system, getting water at the well, cooking for the many volunteers... Many people are also now busy working on the latest project - an earth bag peace hut. The hut is a joint project of OTEPIC with the Global Campus - an international group of ""peace-workers-in-training"" mainly from Tamera, and is connected to a lineage of earth bag huts catalyzed by Beyond Boundaries. Together we, the international community and the local community, have shared in council, had women's circles, cooked <i>ugali</i> (maize) for 40 people, planted seeds, sang and danced, moved soil, prayed. And most recently 30 of us went on a pilgrimage to Mount Elgon (Tulwetaab Kony), the source of the River Zabwani which flows adjacent to the future OTEPIC peace village and is the main source of water for the region.

UPDATE: The goal is reached... AND you can still contribute!!!! Thank you for such a wonderful outpouring of love, support, money, curiosity and affirmation. It is nourishing to feel connected in the trust of the global circle and is truly a gift... to me, to the OTEPIC community and I know will have ripples into other areas as well. As there is still energy moving, if you feel to contribute, there are plenty of ways that the funds can and will be used. Philip, I and others are discussing an indigenous tree planting initiative in the area involving a wonderful man with a local tree nursery. There is also the possibility of paying forward some of the funds to the permaculture project connected to PRI Kenya and Joseph Lentunyoi, who is sponsoring the training course next month. Philip has also expressed desire for a 2-3 day council training for the OTEPIC volunteers and community. I appreciate your trust in me and will do my best to listen deeply for how to distribute the funds. And also if you want to donate more specifically, please let me know where you would like the funds to go, and I will do my best to accommodate. (PHOTO BELOW: OTEPIC pilgrimage to Mount Elgon)My StoryHello
friends! I am currently in Kenya as a part of a larger global pilgrimage - a journey of
discovery of how I am to serve in these times of change, to bear witness to
what is happening in the world, to connect with humanitarian projects and
to open to a bigger dream. My trip to Kenya weaves three threads. First, I was
invited to co-offer a council training for a peace project, International Peace
Initiatives, where last year friends, mentors and collaborators with Beyond
Boundaries built an earthen peace hut as well as supported a community of listening through sharing the practice of council. Last week Siri Gunnarson and I led a two-day follow up training for the community as well as held an introduction to council for a local women's group. I also came to visit the permaculture projects
of Joseph Lentunyoi, with PRI Kenya (Permaculture Research Institute – Kenya).
Joseph co-taught an inspiring Permaculture Design Course in California this summer with Warren Brush, of Quail Springs Permaculture Farm and Regenerative Earth Farm, where I was asked to share council as a community building practice and in which I participated as a student. I also came to support and
learn from the work of Philip Munyasia, whom I met in 2010 at a peace research community, Tamera, in Portugal, where he was studying permaculture practices and alternative technologies. I was struck by his humility
and dedication as well as his humor and warm-heartedness and we
became allies and friends.     What Is Being Supported 
Philip has the opportunity to attend a permaculture teachers training
course in Kenya taught by my dear friend
and teacher, Warren Brush, who has
been invited by Joseph Lentunyoi and PRI Kenya to offer this training on January 13-17, 2014. This is a great opportunity for
Philip to strengthen his teaching skills and grow his local and international
network in order to serve more people more effectively. It is
also a great opportunity to connect these peace workers who are all dear to me. 
As all of Philip’s resources - time and money - go directly into his project, I am campaigning to support his participation in this course. The course costs $500, and an additional $200 is needed for transportation and travel expenses. If additional funds come in, they will not be turned away... monies will go toward supporting a tree planting initiative. (PHOTO BELOW: tree nursery at Mt Elgon with another Philip) What is Being ServedIn 2007 after completing his education in bio-intensive agriculture in Kenya, Philip received sponsorship to study in California with John Jeavons, author of How to Grow More Vegetables and then to Tamera in Portugal to study permaculture and peace principles. He then returned to his home town and founded OTEPIC (Organic Technology Extension and Promotion of Initiative Center) to empower his community. Philip is a visionary, community catalyst, activist and educator.I have spent some time now with Philip and the OTEPIC community over the past
weeks in his home place of Kitale, in Northwest Kenya. OTEPIC serves and supports many people in the local community, primarily women and youth, providing alternatives for many youth coming out of the slums. OTEPIC has developed two community education centers with demonstration gardens and integrated alternative technologies and is now in the process of visioning and designing a new piece of land to become an inter-tribal peace village - a model for sustainable living, research and training. Every day at any one of the sites, many children and young people are found working in the gardens, feeding the bio-gas system, getting water at the well, cooking for the many volunteers... Many people are also now busy working on the latest project - an earth bag peace hut. The hut is a joint project of OTEPIC with the Global Campus - an international group of ""peace-workers-in-training"" mainly from Tamera, and is connected to a lineage of earth bag huts catalyzed by Beyond Boundaries.

<h3>Help me go to school to become a midwife!<br/>
</h3>
<p>Ever since I was a little girl I wanted to be a mother. I was born with a genetic disorder called Phenylketonuria {P.K.U.} that at one time made pregnancy and motherhood impossible for people like me. Due to recent research and controlled metabolic treatment, my dream was realized and I have been blessed to have the children that I longed for, feeling fulfilled in a way that I never imagined. <br/></p>
<p>I soon realized after the peaceful home birth of my son twelve years ago that another calling would soon make it's path known to me and thus began my journey of caring for and mothering other mothers. I knew that I was to be a midwife. With small babies and children to raise and care for, I heeded the advice of my midwife to wait until my children were older to pursue midwifery but the drive and passion would not leave me. I became a childbirth educator and birth and postpartum doula in order to serve and be with childbearing women in what little ways I could while juggling family and home. I spent time teaching classes in my home and in their homes, rallying for better birth choices in my state, supporting midwives, attending births of my friends and loved ones and clients, while usually getting little sleep and making little to no money. This was not a job, this was a passion. I have been honored to witness the beautiful births of amazing women, becoming mothers for the first and subsequent time. I have been witness to their transformation and to their babies' peaceful entries into this world. I have spent many bleary nights counseling and listening to women , helping to educate them about their choices as well as guiding them toward more faith and trust in themselves and their own bodies. I have cried with women through the telling of their birth stories and as they processed their grief and pain and joy. I have held their hands and their backs and their legs and cried with them while they welcomed their baby into this world, in awe of their strength and amazing power. My passion has been to help them have a better, safer birth that they will remember forever. I have been <i>becoming</i> a midwife. <br/></p>
<p>As a mother of many young children, the goal of  midwifery has seemed unreachable both due to time and financial constraints. I have put midwifery studies on hold more than once due to these issues but now that my children are older and are excited about supporting me through this journey {they love to see the pics of the new Mommies and babies when I arrive home from a long birth!} I am feeling that pull once again and this time I am answering it.  The financial burden seems overwhelming to me at times and has caused me to waiver in the past. Yet, I know that as each day passes by it is one less day I have to truly serve women in the way that I feel called to. <br/></p>
<p>One thing I have learned in the most painful way a person can learn is that life is short and we may not be here tomorrow. Every day is a gift and this moment is all we have. I refuse to live with regret. So, I am reaching out to my family and friends. I truly can't do this without your help and support! <br/></p>

<h3>The Impact of a midwife for every woman:<br/>

<p>Giving birth is something that women will remember for the rest of their lives. Having given birth six times myself, I can remember each birth as if it were yesterday. I can hear the sounds of my babies crying for the first time, the smell of their newborn head the moment I first held them, and the warmth in my arms as they laid in my arms- their mouths open and searching for something to eat. I remember every smell and noise and specific words that were spoken. I remember how I felt as they each came into the world and sometimes if I smell or hear something similar it takes me back to their birth days. I tell them their stories and they love to hear how they were born. We will be telling our stories until we die. Twice I almost lost my life giving birth while I was under the care of an obstetrician. While I am grateful to utilize the surgical services of the obstetrical profession when they are necessary, the majority of women do not need a surgeon to give birth. The more midwives we have for women, the better our outcomes will be and the better chance women will have for a safer, more peaceful birth.<br/></p>
<p>I want to be apart of that! I wholeheartedly support the idea that more midwives = better care for women and babies. Women are the ultimate decision makers. They need more midwives to choose from and we need to revolutionize maternity care in this country to improve maternal and child health.</p>
<p>I am grateful 
to be here to tell my story. I will continue to tell my stories, as we 
all do, until the day my time on this earth is over. It is who I am. It 
is who we all are. We are all our stories and experiences. We all have 
so much to share with one another. <br/></p>
<p>I hope you will choose to be apart of this too by helping me reach my goal of becoming a midwife. I am honored to serve women during this most memorable and important time in their life. It truly is a calling for me. With your help, I will be able to offer more choices for women in my own community. We can all do something to improve our world- just a little bit at a time- and in small ways. <br/></p>

<br/></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Help me go to school to become a midwife!

Ever since I was a little girl I wanted to be a mother. I was born with a genetic disorder called Phenylketonuria {P.K.U.} that at one time made pregnancy and motherhood impossible for people like me. Due to recent research and controlled metabolic treatment, my dream was realized and I have been blessed to have the children that I longed for, feeling fulfilled in a way that I never imagined. 
I soon realized after the peaceful home birth of my son twelve years ago that another calling would soon make it's path known to me and thus began my journey of caring for and mothering other mothers. I knew that I was to be a midwife. With small babies and children to raise and care for, I heeded the advice of my midwife to wait until my children were older to pursue midwifery but the drive and passion would not leave me. I became a childbirth educator and birth and postpartum doula in order to serve and be with childbearing women in what little ways I could while juggling family and home. I spent time teaching classes in my home and in their homes, rallying for better birth choices in my state, supporting midwives, attending births of my friends and loved ones and clients, while usually getting little sleep and making little to no money. This was not a job, this was a passion. I have been honored to witness the beautiful births of amazing women, becoming mothers for the first and subsequent time. I have been witness to their transformation and to their babies' peaceful entries into this world. I have spent many bleary nights counseling and listening to women , helping to educate them about their choices as well as guiding them toward more faith and trust in themselves and their own bodies. I have cried with women through the telling of their birth stories and as they processed their grief and pain and joy. I have held their hands and their backs and their legs and cried with them while they welcomed their baby into this world, in awe of their strength and amazing power. My passion has been to help them have a better, safer birth that they will remember forever. I have been becoming a midwife. 
As a mother of many young children, the goal of  midwifery has seemed unreachable both due to time and financial constraints. I have put midwifery studies on hold more than once due to these issues but now that my children are older and are excited about supporting me through this journey {they love to see the pics of the new Mommies and babies when I arrive home from a long birth!} I am feeling that pull once again and this time I am answering it.  The financial burden seems overwhelming to me at times and has caused me to waiver in the past. Yet, I know that as each day passes by it is one less day I have to truly serve women in the way that I feel called to. 
One thing I have learned in the most painful way a person can learn is that life is short and we may not be here tomorrow. Every day is a gift and this moment is all we have. I refuse to live with regret. So, I am reaching out to my family and friends. I truly can't do this without your help and support!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p></p>
<p>    My name is Sam Saunders, and I am a student at the University of Michigan School of Music double majoring in music composition and piano performance. I am the founder and president of the community service group ""Seventh Mile Music"".    </p>
<p>   Seventh Mile Music is a group that provides free music lessons to youth in inner city areas of Detroit. Drawing from the abundant musical talent found within the student body of the University of Michigan, we arrange weekly trips to several community centers to provide lessons to children that are interested. As the group grows, we plan to expand and teach more students throughout the city. Through fundraising, we seek to be able to provide permanent instruments to the community centers and those that are particularly interested.</p>
<p>     Besides the many individual benefits that playing an instrument allows, playing music can bring people together. We have students play music with each other, and aspire towards group concerts for them to showcase all that they have learned.</p>
<p>      I worked on a program similar to this in a poverty-stricken area of my home state of West Virginia, and we held an end of the year concert. We had pianists, drummers, rappers, violinists, bands -family and friends came to watch and it was a great experience for everyone involved. Many of the kids developed a love for music and dedicated time to practicing that would otherwise have been wasted or spent getting into trouble.</p>
<p>      I believe that this program could be of great benefit to kids in Detroit. Drawing from the school of music and from the general student body, I hope that this group can grow and reach out to many areas of Detroit.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>     We are hoping to raise $2500 for our group. 100% of this money would go to buying instruments to provide for the kids to practice on. We bring our instruments with us to teach the children, but their musical benefits are hindered by the lack of instruments to practice on when we are not there.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>     Growing up in a family of legal aid lawyers, I have been exposed and taught about poverty and crime in urban cities for much of my life. I have learned that one of the greatest problems that kids growing up in an inner-city environment face is a simple one that is often overlooked -- probably because it is so hard to quantitatively measure. This problem is the lack of things for them to do. These kids in inner-city Detroit are stranded with few activities to pursue and little money to seek anything out. This is a serious contributing factor to teens getting involved with drugs and violence.</div>
<div>     One of the great things about music is that there is no end to it -- you can't one day be ""finished"" with the piano or violin. By getting the kids that we work with (mostly of elementary school age) interested in music, we can give them an endless outlet to fill their time, to express their emotions, and to get away from things -- as well as exposing them to the arts and potentially instilling them with a passion for music they would have never otherwise had the opportunity to find.</div>

the keeper of a rare and priceless Oral History Collection. In the1970's countless interviews were undertaken with
Plains Cree, Woodland and Swampy Cree, Saulteaux and Dakota Elders, both men
and women in an effort to document the histories of our peoples. Stories that are already only known by a few are recorded in this collection for the education of future generations. This entire collection is currently in a variety of formats such as reel
to reel, DAT, cassette tape, VHS, and Beta. These will be digitized over time
and will ultimately be available for educational purposes.<span>  </span></p><p><span>Recently, this collection had to be moved from where it was being stored in protective cabinets. Sadly, the protective shelving was not owned by the collection's keeper and did not move with the collection. The collection is now being stored in boxes and protective shelves are needed for their orderly storage and protection.</span></p><h3>What We Need </h3><p>These shelves cost $500 each and we need five of them. The funds will be used exclusively for the purpose of buying shelves and fees associated with this form of fundraising. If we don't meet our target, enough to buy five shelves, we will buy as many shelves as we can with the funds that are raised. If funds are left over, that is not sufficient to buy a shelf it will be saved and combined with future fund raising efforts to obtain the number of shelves needed.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Should you decide to help, you can forever feel a part of protecting these critical histories. As one Cree Elder stated in a 1970 interview:</p><p>
</p><p><i>""To those of you young people who in the future, will be listening
to us in these recordings, listen carefully to the teachings, stories and
songs...this is what we have to offer you, what we have left for you. By the
time you listen to these recordings of Elders who have agreed to be
interviewed, we will be no more and long gone. We ask that you take the
information and knowledge that has been shared by our old people and translate
and transcribe from our respective indigenous languages into English and take

the keeper of a rare and priceless Oral History Collection. In the1970's countless interviews were undertaken with
Plains Cree, Woodland and Swampy Cree, Saulteaux and Dakota Elders, both men
and women in an effort to document the histories of our peoples. Stories that are already only known by a few are recorded in this collection for the education of future generations. This entire collection is currently in a variety of formats such as reel
to reel, DAT, cassette tape, VHS, and Beta. These will be digitized over time
and will ultimately be available for educational purposes.  Recently, this collection had to be moved from where it was being stored in protective cabinets. Sadly, the protective shelving was not owned by the collection's keeper and did not move with the collection. The collection is now being stored in boxes and protective shelves are needed for their orderly storage and protection.What We Need These shelves cost $500 each and we need five of them. The funds will be used exclusively for the purpose of buying shelves and fees associated with this form of fundraising. If we don't meet our target, enough to buy five shelves, we will buy as many shelves as we can with the funds that are raised. If funds are left over, that is not sufficient to buy a shelf it will be saved and combined with future fund raising efforts to obtain the number of shelves needed.The ImpactShould you decide to help, you can forever feel a part of protecting these critical histories. As one Cree Elder stated in a 1970 interview:
""To those of you young people who in the future, will be listening
to us in these recordings, listen carefully to the teachings, stories and
songs...this is what we have to offer you, what we have left for you. By the
time you listen to these recordings of Elders who have agreed to be
interviewed, we will be no more and long gone. We ask that you take the
information and knowledge that has been shared by our old people and translate
and transcribe from our respective indigenous languages into English and take
it into the schools. Only we have the responsibility and obligation to properly
tell and share our history, our story.""

<h3>What is Politicus?</h3>
<p>Politicus is an advanced and innovative political simulation game. The player will take on the role of the head of government of a real-life country of their choice and has one term to make changes to almost every aspect of the country, such as health, education, economy, law and more. Every change has a certain impact on the state of the country as well as the player's support among numerous voter groups. The player will rely on the support of these voter groups to win elections and stay in power, which will allow him or her to fulfil their vision of a perfect society, be it a classless communist state or a libertarian paradise.  Our innovative voting system allows for an immersive and realistic simulation of the joys and annoyances of governance. The advanced economic system will ensure that the player's vision is grounded with financial constraints. Numerous other features, such as the existence of corruption make the game challenging and fun to play. Players must win support among many different voter groups, make political deals with their rivals, secure party funding and much, much more. The player will be able to change almost everything about their country through a number of ministries (hover over the icons on the right to see just some of the areas of government). Each ministry is responsible for a certain aspect of the country and will giver the player many possible solutions to very important matters, such as the foreign policy, welfare, health and much more.</p>
<p>The choices made by the players will follow them all the way to the ballot box, as each choice has certain political consequences. For example, improving public services will surely be welcomed by the poor, socialists and a large part of the population, but the upper and middle class voters will be not be contempt with the increased tax burden. The player must balance between different voter groups and reach a consensus that most of the voters will accept in order to get reelected. Almost every choice the player makes has some sort of effect on the voters, the country or both. The advanced simulation system in Politicus aims to recreate the real-life effects of most decisions through the use of real data and statistics, making it the most advanced political simulation yet. By making the right choices for the people the player can improve their country and win the next election...or end up jobless. </p>
<p>Apart from creating a very entertaining game we aim to create the realistic political simulator that could be applied throughout many many education institutions in the United Kingdom and the world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Politicus was made by a small team of two people. All of the systems used in the game are already finished, as well as a sizeable chunk of software development. The funds that we gain through crowdfunding will be spend on an additional programmer and  better graphics. With these resources we will be able to complete the game in early 2017.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Politicus?</h3>
<p>Politicus will be an enjoyable and rewarding experience for gamers, especially fans of simulation games, while still being an accurate political and economical model that can be used for educational purposes. We believe in creating a game that is not only accessible and fun to play, but will also educate players about the power of their political system, the diversity of views and methods of solving problems, as well as the essence of democracy. </p>

These will be used for the project for teacher training in rural areas this year. These funds will cover the cost of training nearly <u>1,000</u> teachers. Our overall target for the first phase of the English Literate India project is <u>10,000</u> teachers and we continue to raise funds for the project in 2018 through this campaign.

Out of these 82% cannot read simple English words. They only know their local language. Why is this a problem?</p><p>Higher and especially professional education in India is only offered in English. Almost no English is spoken in rural India. Without an environment or fluent teachers, learning a language is near-impossible. This has limited the participation of children from rural India in professional education and careers for generations. They are thus left without the means to aim for a better life. English is the key to opportunities in India and for rural kids these doors never open. In India, #EnglishOpensDoors </p><p><a href=""http://leapforword.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LeapForWord</a> is a registered non-profit organization working for 10+ years to enable equal access to higher education by teaching English in rural India. How are we able to teach a language where there is neither an environment nor teachers who speak English? We spent a good part of the last 10 years trying to figure that out! </p><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510516714/lxvcl810fbcmngsky1if.png"" src=""""/></h2><p>India has 29 states and 22 official languages. Indian languages have originated from Sanskrit - one of the most ancient languages in the world. That means all of these languages have similar grammar structures. LeapForWord's innovative solution works on this concept on common grammars. We teach English by translating between English and any Indian language with common grammar patterns using translation algorithms we have developed in-house.</p><p>Teachers cannot teach a language that is part of the curriculum but that they can barely speak. What if they could deliver English lessons through their local language? Our techniques do exactly that. We teach vocabulary as well as grammar by creating rules on how local language patterns map to English. Some of the peculiarities of the English language are also taught using rules e.g. why is 'C' pronounced differently in Cat v/s City. Most native speakers intuitively develop these rules. Our methods teach them explicitly.</p><p>Having worked in the field for over 10 years, we came to understand the real cause for children not being able to learn English in rural India is the absence of learning environment rather than better solutions in terms of training material or teachers. So we developed new solutions based on field experience to address the real problem. From our programs we see <u>that delivers results</u>!</p><p>See a short video of our methods used in the classrooms in rural India:</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/a2zS7MQwK6o?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><h3> </h3><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510516740/umoa1roaenktbk1hsmnp.png"" src=""""/></h2><p>Several people who study education policy in India have observed that although free and public education is available across the country the quality of education in English and Math is very poor. We have chosen to tackle the problem of quality of English as this is not just a subject or language for children from India but the opportunity for a better life. Such large scale change takes decades to accomplish. However, we have set upon ourselves the challenge to accomplish this in our lifetime. Our near term target is training <u>100,000 teachers by 2019</u> (<i>project 100Kby2019</i>) who will be able to teach English to their students through our solution. We want to achieve an <strong>English Literate India</strong>.</p><p>We think this is possible because we have:</p><ul>
<li>Identified the correct problem, i.e. environment rather than curriculum is keeping children from learning English effectively.</li>
<li>Created a novel solution to make English rule-based like Math. English is taught as sets of rules and translation techniques.</li>
<li>Designed methods that <u>do not</u> rely on English-proficient teachers, a rarity in rural India, to teach English.</li>
<li>Low cost which will make it possible to be adopted in rural regions.</li>
<li>Developed a sustainable model by working within the public school systems and making use of technology.</li>
</ul><p>These factors we believe has helped us develop a solution that has the capability to enable children from all over rural India to learn English even in absence of English fluent teachers or environment. Our pilot, where we have trained 2000+ teachers (teaching over 20,000 students), has demonstrated our solution is working.</p><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510516763/ptg6wtyvp1eaqriskrwt.png"" src=""""/></h2><p><a href=""http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/english-for-all/article19803916.ece"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Hindu</a>, a leading national newspaper wrote about us in their article '<i>English For All '</i></p><p> <a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=2&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjSsJfmq-7WAhWkhFQKHfPxDR4QtwIILTAB&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DCUAAT_5vhDw&amp;usg=AOvVaw1lhvZPhYOP43f7R8XOOdQu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NDTV</a> a national TV channel, featured a story on LeapForWord's founder <i>Pranil Naik</i>.</p><p><a href=""https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitmJbvke7WAhWIq1QKHSm7CRgQtwIIKDAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DChHNo0f2F9c&amp;usg=AOvVaw0GpVWUWIJUqZkZzzxWgVPK"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TimesNow</a> a  national TV channel features us as part of their segment '<i>The Good Crusaders</i>'</p><p><a href=""https://yourstory.com/2017/09/leapforword-english-regional-language/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">YourStory.com</a> features us on their <i>SocialStory</i> segment</p><p><a href=""https://www.thebetterindia.com/90460/leap-for-word-pranil-naik-english-education/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TheBetterIndia.com</a> featured us for our <i>positive impact</i>!</p><p>An article about our organization in the <a href=""http://baysidejournal.com/pranil-naiks-leapforword-on-a-mission-to-make-india-english-literate/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">BaySideJournal</a></p><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510516786/lzfnndj8tyebh4xuxqjw.png"" src=""""/></h2><p>Our goal is not simply teaching a language but eradicating the barriers to opportunities that English is creating in rural India.

To achieve this in the early phase we will train teachers who are influencers and technology enthusiasts (relatively speaking!). We work on the principle of diffusion of innovation. For any change to be adopted it needs to cross the threshold of 16% adoption. In Phase I our aim is to cross this 16%. This will make disseminating teacher training easier in Phase II.</p><p><i><u>Traditional teaching philosophies:</u></i> Our teaching methods are designed to teach English in non-native environments with very practical and easy to follow approaches. However, purists or proponents of other teaching methods sometimes do not agree and they are sometimes decision-makers at certain institutions. Here we will have to contend with bias - this takes time. To contend this we methodically record our assessments and keep updating our programs with learning from the field.</p><p><u><i>Other challenges: </i></u>Even after they learn English, not every child will access higher education.

These will be used for the project for teacher training in rural areas this year. These funds will cover the cost of training nearly 1,000 teachers. Our overall target for the first phase of the English Literate India project is 10,000 teachers and we continue to raise funds for the project in 2018 through this campaign. If you like our project, do contribute!Nearly 140 million students in India are enrolled in government schools. Out of these 82% cannot read simple English words. They only know their local language. Why is this a problem?Higher and especially professional education in India is only offered in English. Almost no English is spoken in rural India. Without an environment or fluent teachers, learning a language is near-impossible. This has limited the participation of children from rural India in professional education and careers for generations. They are thus left without the means to aim for a better life. English is the key to opportunities in India and for rural kids these doors never open. In India, #EnglishOpensDoors LeapForWord is a registered non-profit organization working for 10+ years to enable equal access to higher education by teaching English in rural India. How are we able to teach a language where there is neither an environment nor teachers who speak English? We spent a good part of the last 10 years trying to figure that out! India has 29 states and 22 official languages. Indian languages have originated from Sanskrit - one of the most ancient languages in the world. That means all of these languages have similar grammar structures. LeapForWord's innovative solution works on this concept on common grammars. We teach English by translating between English and any Indian language with common grammar patterns using translation algorithms we have developed in-house.Teachers cannot teach a language that is part of the curriculum but that they can barely speak. What if they could deliver English lessons through their local language? Our techniques do exactly that. We teach vocabulary as well as grammar by creating rules on how local language patterns map to English. Some of the peculiarities of the English language are also taught using rules e.g. why is 'C' pronounced differently in Cat v/s City. Most native speakers intuitively develop these rules. Our methods teach them explicitly.Having worked in the field for over 10 years, we came to understand the real cause for children not being able to learn English in rural India is the absence of learning environment rather than better solutions in terms of training material or teachers. So we developed new solutions based on field experience to address the real problem. From our programs we see that delivers results!See a short video of our methods used in the classrooms in rural India: Several people who study education policy in India have observed that although free and public education is available across the country the quality of education in English and Math is very poor. We have chosen to tackle the problem of quality of English as this is not just a subject or language for children from India but the opportunity for a better life. Such large scale change takes decades to accomplish. However, we have set upon ourselves the challenge to accomplish this in our lifetime. Our near term target is training 100,000 teachers by 2019 (project 100Kby2019) who will be able to teach English to their students through our solution. We want to achieve an English Literate India.We think this is possible because we have:
Identified the correct problem, i.e. environment rather than curriculum is keeping children from learning English effectively.
Created a novel solution to make English rule-based like Math. English is taught as sets of rules and translation techniques.
Designed methods that do not rely on English-proficient teachers, a rarity in rural India, to teach English.
Low cost which will make it possible to be adopted in rural regions.
Developed a sustainable model by working within the public school systems and making use of technology.
These factors we believe has helped us develop a solution that has the capability to enable children from all over rural India to learn English even in absence of English fluent teachers or environment. Our pilot, where we have trained 2000+ teachers (teaching over 20,000 students), has demonstrated our solution is working.The Hindu, a leading national newspaper wrote about us in their article 'English For All ' NDTV a national TV channel, featured a story on LeapForWord's founder Pranil Naik.TimesNow a  national TV channel features us as part of their segment 'The Good Crusaders'YourStory.com features us on their SocialStory segmentTheBetterIndia.com featured us for our positive impact!An article about our organization in the BaySideJournalOur goal is not simply teaching a language but eradicating the barriers to opportunities that English is creating in rural India. The rural regions where we work, are also the poorer regions and deserve solutions that they can afford. We are a non-profit and we offer our training as well as teaching material available at the lowest cost possible. We are, to the best of our knowledge, the cheapest classroom learning solution in India. In 2017, we have caught on with the digital wave! Smartphones have become readily available throughout all of India. EkStep, a free online learning platform, has partnered with us and all our content is available as an App on the platform. The EkStep team with its experience in rolling out technology at the national level will help LeapForWord scale nationally! (EkStep is an initiative by the team that rolled out the Aadhar card system nationally in India. Aadhar card is the equivalent of social security or tax card.)If you would like to support our cause, please back us. Your contribution will be used for training teachers to teach English in rural India. The cost of training one teacher is $19. Your contribution will make a difference! To support us select the level of support from $15, $25, $50, $75, $125, $285 from the perks section (the column on the right hand side of this webpage). Perks are a way of thanking you for your support by a humble token of appreciation. Any contribution $285 and above qualifies for all perks. For each perk there is an option of choosing a digital version to reduce printing and shipping costs. You can also click the pink 'Back It' button at the top of the page to contribute a different amount. For those who contribute via the 'Back it' button we will contact you by email for your perk preference.For donating in Indian Rupees, please email us at englishopensdoors@leapforword.orgShare our campaign page with your friends, they may want to support this project too!We started LeapForWord with funds from personal savings. Over the last 10 years we have operated by raising funds from grants. Institutions funding non-profits are fewer and sometimes have long approval processes. As awareness about our organization grew, we came across many individuals who have loved this project and have wanted to support and contribute. We would love for people to participate in this project. This indeed is a way to democratically achieve social change!We are running this campaign to gain the support of people who like us feel that talented children from rural India deserve the same opportunity to higher education as their talented urban peers. If you believe in our cause, show us your support!Out goal is to train 100,000 teachers by Dec 2019. Between 2017 and 2019 our programs will move from the physical in-person training to more digital training and to reduce training costs and improve the reach to various regions of India. 

Phase I - Jul 2017 to Mar 2018 - 10,000 teachers, $19 per teacher : Total cost $190,000

Phase II - Apr 2018 to Dec 2019 - 90,000 teachers, $6 per teacher : Total cost $540,000
We have so far raised $62,000 through our institutional donors. Our goal for this campaign is to raise $50,000 or more to be used towards training 100,000 teachers by 2019.We use funds for teacher training as follows:If unexpected circumstances occur, we may at times make changes to the planned fund allocation. In this case, the details of actual fund utilization will be provided in the semi-annual progress report emailed to each donor.An English Literate village:Joyada, a village in Maharashtra where we have worked the longest, is being targeted as India's first English Literate village. Some results from Joyada:
20 students  have successfully cleared entrance examinations to get admission semi-English schools. Earlier not even a single student had been successful as there is a 20 mark English section which was always the primary reason of failures.
Students from our very first children's batch completed high school  (Grade 10) in 2014-2015. Every single student from that batch opted for Science (which is taught in English). 
Rural youth reliant on farming teach our programs for additional income. This additional stable income has brought better lifestyles for 15 such families.
An interim report on Joyada can be found here.An English Literate Taluka (County):Maval, a taluka (county) in the district of Pune Maharashtra has been targeted as the first English Literate county. We have been working here since 2016. 
225 teachers took up our concepts because they found them to be of high value. Our programs are voluntary and not mandatory.
Hearing about our results from Maval we were invited by the nearby taluka of Mulshi. We will complete training of teachers in Mulshi by November 2017. 
An one page summary report on Maval can be found here. Detailed report here.Working with NGOs: We have also worked with some non government organizations (i.e. outside the public school system but serving poorer communities). One such project was with Nashik Ashram Schools from 2016-2017.
About 900 students were taught in these schools
All students in our programs from grade 4 to grade 8 did better than the national average on standard ASER tests
A one-page report on Nashik can be found here. Detailed report here.For his innovative idea of teaching English through regional languages and enabling its large scale adoption uisng technology, LeapForWord founder Pranil Naik was awarded the prestigious  Ashoka Fellowship. The Ashoka organization recognizes changemakers from all over the world working to improve society.Some testimonials from the field from our partners, supporters and teachers:Check our image and video gallery for more pictures and videos from the field - including a video of our Word Power Championship - a spelling competition we where students from several villages participate!We know that the road to such wide-scale change will not be smooth. Here are some challenges we foresee.Digital training: Training teachers via the digital medium will need ways to overcome some digital inertia among this group. To achieve this in the early phase we will train teachers who are influencers and technology enthusiasts (relatively speaking!). We work on the principle of diffusion of innovation. For any change to be adopted it needs to cross the threshold of 16% adoption. In Phase I our aim is to cross this 16%. This will make disseminating teacher training easier in Phase II.Traditional teaching philosophies: Our teaching methods are designed to teach English in non-native environments with very practical and easy to follow approaches. However, purists or proponents of other teaching methods sometimes do not agree and they are sometimes decision-makers at certain institutions. Here we will have to contend with bias - this takes time. To contend this we methodically record our assessments and keep updating our programs with learning from the field.Other challenges: Even after they learn English, not every child will access higher education. For some other barriers will come forth. However, when we see children in our programs be the first English speakers in their family it fills them with such confidence they believe they can achieve anything. And we believe this confidence in itself will enrich their lives!LeapForWord was started in 2006 by six classmates in an MBA program at Syndenham College in Mumbai who believed that the sole purpose of a higher education should not be a higher salary but to improve society.

</p><p>     Hello, my name is Diana Alejandra Rivera, I am eighteen years old and I
live at El Porvenir, La Ceiba, Atlantida. I have one sister named Lauren
Rivera, and my mother is named Ana Cardona. The problem I’m facing right now,
which is financial, started in 2008 when my grandmother
was shot in our house. My mom has always been a woman who likes to work and
succeed in whatever she does. That year she decided to open her own
business.</p>
<p> 
We were having a great time for what I can tell. But everything changed
when some men got into our house and stole our money and killed my grandmother. That morning literally
everything went from good to bad, getting to a point that it affected my daily life. Last year I was a junior in High School and I started noticing that paying my
school was turning into such a difficulty. It has reached the point that now I am
afraid of not being able to finish my senior year at my school-La Ceiba
Bilingual School, commonly known as LCBS. </p>
<p> 
The purpose of me wanting to graduate from my school is because it
gives you the opportunity to have a better job, a better life style and in few
words- a better future. In Honduras, you scarcely have job opportunities and if
you do so, those jobs are only available for the people who are best prepared. That is
why I’m trying to graduate from LCBS, because they give me the
opportunity to get a scholarship and study abroad for university. I have worked really hard to
earn the position I have at school and it really hurts me to know that
probably all the effort I have made so far, can just fade.</p>
<p> 
I am concerned for what is happening because in Honduras we have an age
limit to graduate from high schools, it is normally eighteen years old, maybe
nineteen, which makes it even more difficult. However, I still have big plans for my future. I’ve decided that I want
to study in the United States of America. Some colleges in the states are
accredited to receive foreign students so, at my school, they can help us get in
contact with the principal and try to apply to the universities over there. But
I don’t want to stay there for my entire life, I want to come back to Honduras
and offer people (having single women as my main objective) the opportunity to have a decent job. I love to volunteer. Since my mom started to get
involved in tourism, community service and more, I have found my passion for helping others.</p>
<p> 
I have been an interpreter and a teacher. I am a teacher at my church, Heaven’s Door and at Honduras Child Alliance (HCA). I think it is my
duty to share with others the opportunity I’ve had so far of being a bilingual
girl. Therefore, I value being an english teacher and sharing my knowledge with my community. Not every teen has the chance to be bilingual and I
think my sister and I are blessed for knowing two languages already. It commonly happens here that
teens think ""this is it"" - that there’s nothing beyond Honduras, that they don't have any options.  I know there is way more, and I’m
willing to explore what is out there and provide my country the tools to become
a better country. It might be one person at a time, but with knowledge and
wisdom every dream can come true. Thank you for reading this brief story of my
life. All of that is Diana. </p>

I am a graduate student (MA in International Development Studies) in Saint Mary's University, Halifax, Canada starting from 3rd Sept 2014. I was born to a very poor family living in the hills of rural Nepal. I had to stop going to school at the age of 10 because my house along with other 14 houses in our village burned down. Fortunately, with the support of United Mission to Nepal, I was able to complete my high school studies. Due to my economic circumstances, there were gaps in my educational career, but I completed my Master’s degree in Environmental Science and Management from Nepal. Now I know that some of the reasons behind this disaster were the ignorance of the people and the changing climate.  With that horrible memory always in my mind, I understand the importance of harmony between humans and nature and the need for sustainable development and peace. For these reasons I decided to study further and also obtained a place in the above mentioned university. I have received 7000 Canadian dollars as a scholarship from the University and I still need $ 7065 plus the air tickets. A further advantage is that one of my mentors, Richard James Hoyle, a retired Professor of Dalhousie University, whom I have known since I was 12 years old, lives in Halifax. He has generously offered accommodations while I am in Halifax. 

My research interests are climate change, natural resource management, development with sustainability, and renewable energy. My thesis is entitled Environmental management in an urban fringe, a case study in squatter settlement for adaptation to climate change.  It examined environmental aspects of urban environmental management and adaptation to climate change. The study  focused on one squatter settlement’s adaptation to climate change and proposes strategies for managing the environment there to make it better prepared and more responsive to climate change.  Specifically, it addresses biodegradable solid waste management to generate bio-gas, carbon sequestration to reduce total carbon in the atmosphere and a control system for its frequent flooding. Moreover it provides knowledge to the settlement people that they can generate money by managing solid waste properly to produce bio-gas. 

The changing weather pattern really has an adverse impact on our lives. So the knowledge I would gain through study in Saint Mary's University would not only benefit me but even possibly my nation and its people. For example, four years ago, the people of my village asked for help. The previous year they could not grow rice well. I told them it was due to climate change. I then advised them to plant rice seedlings in two different plots at different times and transplant those seedlings according to the rainfall. I met the villagers after a year and they told me that they had adjusted to the changing climate and were very thankful for my help. My career goal is to work with the people here in Nepal, helping them find such solutions in this changing climate situation so they can sustain their lives in the most difficult situations they face. 

If I can raise about $ 10, 100 dollars, I will be able to continue this program, learn more and then take my new knowledge and skills to the people here in Nepal, who is living in real poverty. The proposed research and study in Canada will enable me gain sufficient knowledge and skills to better service my nation and people, and also enable me to connect Nepal with broader international community, through Canada.  In this way I hope to benefit not only myself and my family, but those living in my village and someday all over Nepal.  I hope who ever read my story will help me to help my nation and its people.</div>","My Name is Bimal Aryal from Nepal.

We disagree and think we can do better by our communities, and we think education is the place to start.</p><p>Rape culture can be identified and challenged by developing age-appropriate educational programs that teach kids, adolescents and adults about consent, communication, and respect.</p><p>While there are many amazing organizations devoted to preventing rape, very few exist to challenge the cultural foundations that make rape so prevalent and inadequately challenged. PARC is focused on teaching communities how to identify and challenge rape culture to better prevent and address rape and sexual assault, and we need your help to accomplish that.</p><p><b>What We Need</b></p><p>We are asking contributors to help us raise $3000 to help cover our start-up costs and launch our services. Costs such as:</p><ul><li><p>Filing fees to cover the costs of getting us our incorporation and 501(c)3 licenses (our team of pro bono attorneys were amazing, and fronted the money to pay these fees, but we need to reimburse them for those costs)</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Materials for customized age-appropriate educational programs</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Administrative and promotional materials like business cards, brochures and other handouts to help raise awareness about PARC so we can reach more people</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Shared office space for hosting meetings, interviews, and administrative services</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Marketing and advertising costs</p></li></ul><p>If we don't reach our goal, all is not lost! In fact, whatever we receive will go towards these fees, educational and promotional materials, marketing, and administrative resources. We're working with nothing but our own pockets right now, so any contribution will be crucially helpful and appreciated.</p><p><b>The Impact</b></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Rape affects everyone, not just the offensive and purposely misleading trope of the intoxicated co-ed walking home on a dark street. It is a traumatizing assault that a woman is twice as likely to face than breast cancer. 1 in 33 men will be victims of rape in their lifetimes. Rape claims almost half of its victims before age 18. Thousands upon thousands of women, men, and children will be traumatically violated and then be exponentially more likely to suffer from repeated sexual assault, depression, substance abuse, and suicide, adding up to a vicious cycle of destruction. </span></p><p>We can't underscore enough how damaging and far-reaching the effects of rape and sexual assault are on the ability and right of survivors to lead healthy functioning lives free of trauma as members of our communities. Supporting PARC will be supporting and meeting a desperate and critical need for an agent of positive and effective change in how we eradicate this epidemic of devastating violence to support the human right to life, liberty, and prosperity.</p><p><b>Risks and Challenges</b></p><p>Financial insolvency is our biggest threat. We are currently an all-volunteer organization, doing what we can out of pocket and by accessing free or low-cost resources, in the time we can dedicate apart from our 'day jobs'. We address this risk by keeping overhead costs low and developing multiple overlapping fundraising strategies, such as seeking grants, soliciting donors and developing crowd funding campaigns. Adequate funding will in turn provide for more resources, most notably our time and energy and that of future staff we can bring on.</p><p>We deeply appreciate anything you can give. Take a look at our perks to the right, but if you'd like to make your donation go even further feel free to waive the gift. Either way, thank you for your support.</p><p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We appreciate that you may want to support PARC but can't do so financially, and we still want your help! You can like us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter, Instagram and Tmblr and share our webpage with as many people as you can. You can engage with us in conversations about rape culture here, send us your #ineedPARCbecause testimonial selfie, and invite us to come into your schools, communities, and organizations to offer educational programs for all ages.

Founded by Christine Gordon in response to the aftermath of Steubenville, we are a small group of educators, sociologists, policy analysts and communications professionals working to change the conversation around rape and sexual assault using education, advocacy and collaboration.Rape culture refers to the practices, beliefs, discourses and laws that trivialize, naturalize, and excuse rape. We recognize all around us signs and messages from our culture that rape and sexual assault are not important and that it is the responsibility of victims and survivors to prevent rape, and we couldn't disagree more.Rape Culture is:Universities having video evidence of rape, finding the perpetrators guilty, and punishing them by expelling them after they graduatePolice having video evidence of a rape and closing the investigation claiming there's not enough evidenceWomen who serve in the US military being more likely to be raped by a fellow serviceman than to be killed by enemy fire, resulting in sexual trauma being the leading cause of PTSD in military women
The Air Force showing how seriously they take internal justice by creating the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Program and having the appointed head get arrested for sexual battery himself
And more of the same over at the Army
A judge telling a 14-year old victim she dressed older than her age and had equal control over the situation as her 49-year old teacher who raped her, who was sentenced to 30 days in jailA police officer leading a sexual assault prevention program and telling participants to avoid rape by not “dressing slutty”Venerable newspapers standing behind opinion pieces that claim sexual assault confers special privileges, and that marriage is the key to avoiding rapeConsistency in framing and reporting of rape such that what is pictured is the man jumping out of the bushes, when in fact 2/3 of survivors know their rapist, and many are married to them
A comic who responds to a heckler with a racial slur and gets immediate reprimand and censure for hate speech versus a comic who suggests the humor in a heckler getting raped and in turn gets overwhelming support for his right to joke about rape
The fact that all this goes on and powerful legislators, media outlets and organizations rail against the depth and pervasiveness of rape and sexual assault
Rape culture is so ingrained and prevalent that many people refute it's existence and claim that rape happens because survivors ask for it by not adequately avoiding the inevitable. We disagree and think we can do better by our communities, and we think education is the place to start.Rape culture can be identified and challenged by developing age-appropriate educational programs that teach kids, adolescents and adults about consent, communication, and respect.While there are many amazing organizations devoted to preventing rape, very few exist to challenge the cultural foundations that make rape so prevalent and inadequately challenged. PARC is focused on teaching communities how to identify and challenge rape culture to better prevent and address rape and sexual assault, and we need your help to accomplish that.What We NeedWe are asking contributors to help us raise $3000 to help cover our start-up costs and launch our services. Costs such as:Filing fees to cover the costs of getting us our incorporation and 501(c)3 licenses (our team of pro bono attorneys were amazing, and fronted the money to pay these fees, but we need to reimburse them for those costs)Materials for customized age-appropriate educational programsAdministrative and promotional materials like business cards, brochures and other handouts to help raise awareness about PARC so we can reach more peopleShared office space for hosting meetings, interviews, and administrative servicesMarketing and advertising costsIf we don't reach our goal, all is not lost! In fact, whatever we receive will go towards these fees, educational and promotional materials, marketing, and administrative resources. We're working with nothing but our own pockets right now, so any contribution will be crucially helpful and appreciated.The ImpactRape affects everyone, not just the offensive and purposely misleading trope of the intoxicated co-ed walking home on a dark street. It is a traumatizing assault that a woman is twice as likely to face than breast cancer. 1 in 33 men will be victims of rape in their lifetimes. Rape claims almost half of its victims before age 18. Thousands upon thousands of women, men, and children will be traumatically violated and then be exponentially more likely to suffer from repeated sexual assault, depression, substance abuse, and suicide, adding up to a vicious cycle of destruction. We can't underscore enough how damaging and far-reaching the effects of rape and sexual assault are on the ability and right of survivors to lead healthy functioning lives free of trauma as members of our communities. Supporting PARC will be supporting and meeting a desperate and critical need for an agent of positive and effective change in how we eradicate this epidemic of devastating violence to support the human right to life, liberty, and prosperity.Risks and ChallengesFinancial insolvency is our biggest threat. We are currently an all-volunteer organization, doing what we can out of pocket and by accessing free or low-cost resources, in the time we can dedicate apart from our 'day jobs'. We address this risk by keeping overhead costs low and developing multiple overlapping fundraising strategies, such as seeking grants, soliciting donors and developing crowd funding campaigns. Adequate funding will in turn provide for more resources, most notably our time and energy and that of future staff we can bring on.We deeply appreciate anything you can give. Take a look at our perks to the right, but if you'd like to make your donation go even further feel free to waive the gift. Either way, thank you for your support.Other Ways You Can HelpWe appreciate that you may want to support PARC but can't do so financially, and we still want your help! You can like us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter, Instagram and Tmblr and share our webpage with as many people as you can. You can engage with us in conversations about rape culture here, send us your #ineedPARCbecause testimonial selfie, and invite us to come into your schools, communities, and organizations to offer educational programs for all ages. Lastly, you can engage with what we are producing and the message we are spreading, and continue this conversation in your own lives with your friends and family. It's time to change the conversation around rape and sexual assault, and we can't do that amongst ourselves. So thank you for visiting our project, and please consider helping in any way you can.

<p>
</p>
<p>Right now there is a young girl in Nepal who is just about to be <b>sold as a slave</b>.<br/>She is the commodity, her parents are the sellers and whoever ‘buys’ her will be her master. Forever.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>She doesn’t know it yet, but <b>sexual and physical abuse</b> will become a part of her life. She’ll live in poverty that you and I can’t even imagine and she will know nothing else till the day she dies. And <b>she is barely 11-year-old.</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>This girl and many like her are called <b>Kamlari girls</b>. <br/>There are thousands of them (many as young as 6-years-old) living in the indigenous Tharu community in Nepal, a place where countless families barely survive on <b>less than €2 per day.</b> <br/>Books and schools are way out of their price range and so most Kamlari girls never get access to education…</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>But, <b>it doesn't have to be that way!</b> And that’s where we and <b>YOU</b> come in.</p>

<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;text-align: start;"">Open Circles FOUNDATION is the philanthropic arm of Open Circles ACADEMY - a visionary educational institute empowering over 180,000 entrepreneurs to <b>create a better world by fulfilling their greatest potential</b>.<br/></p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;text-align: start;"">Realizing that the first step in creating a better world is a better education, we took on ourselves, as the non-profit foundation, the mission to <b>transform the education system in the world</b>. <br/></p>
<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;text-align: start;"">For over 10 years we support educational projects we believe have the potential to change lives for good. During these years we partnered with some of the most successful and respectful philanthropic organizations in the world like:</p>
<ul style=""text-align: start;"">
<li>
<b>Triodos Bank</b> - supporting the Uganda Rural Development School for girls in Uganda (2008).</li>
<li>
<b>Virgin Unite</b> - supporting the Richard Branson Center for Entrepreneurship in South Africa (2013).</li>
<li>
<b>Barefoot Collage and WWF</b> - bringing solar light and training village grandmothers to become solar engineers in rural Madagascar (2014).</li>
<li>
<b style=""text-align: justify;"">Pencils of Promise</b> - building 4 primary schools in rural Laos (2015).</li>

<b>
</b><p>By partnering with leading charities and organizations, Open Circles Foundation <b>CONTRIBUTES</b> to causes that desperately need our help.<br/>And we’re doing it again with this crowdfunding campaign - <b>Save a Girl</b>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Right now we are calling on <b>YOU FOR HELP!</b></p>
</div>
<h3>The Power of Education</h3> <p></p>
<p>Please join us to save young girls and break them free from slavery and abuse through the <b>power of EDUCATION</b>.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>For our 2016 campaign, we’ve partnered with <b>Room to Read</b>, an award winning,  non-profit organization whose goals align with ours. Like us, they envision a world where all children can get access to quality education, reach their full potential and contribute to their community and the world.</p>
<p>Instead of a life of slavery, this 11-year-old girl - and so many others like her - will be free to receive the education she deserves. <b>With YOUR help,</b> she will avoid the horrific fate that looked inevitable and have a completely different life as a consequence. </p>
<p>And <b>the change will ripple through the community.</b></p>
<p>Once this 11-year-old girl breaks out of the Kamlari cycle, she'll be better educated and equipped to help others around her. </p>
<p>It's not just about helping girls of this generation - by freeing and educating these girls, we're empowering them to <b>change the future of their children</b> and their community for generations to come. </p>

Right now there is a young girl in Nepal who is just about to be sold as a slave.She is the commodity, her parents are the sellers and whoever ‘buys’ her will be her master. Forever.


She doesn’t know it yet, but sexual and physical abuse will become a part of her life. She’ll live in poverty that you and I can’t even imagine and she will know nothing else till the day she dies. And she is barely 11-year-old.


This girl and many like her are called Kamlari girls. There are thousands of them (many as young as 6-years-old) living in the indigenous Tharu community in Nepal, a place where countless families barely survive on less than €2 per day. Books and schools are way out of their price range and so most Kamlari girls never get access to education…


But, it doesn't have to be that way! And that’s where we and YOU come in.
Many Kamlari girls are freed, but are in desperate need of education and care
 What We Do
Open Circles FOUNDATION is the philanthropic arm of Open Circles ACADEMY - a visionary educational institute empowering over 180,000 entrepreneurs to create a better world by fulfilling their greatest potential.
Realizing that the first step in creating a better world is a better education, we took on ourselves, as the non-profit foundation, the mission to transform the education system in the world. 
For over 10 years we support educational projects we believe have the potential to change lives for good. During these years we partnered with some of the most successful and respectful philanthropic organizations in the world like:


Triodos Bank - supporting the Uganda Rural Development School for girls in Uganda (2008).

Virgin Unite - supporting the Richard Branson Center for Entrepreneurship in South Africa (2013).

Barefoot Collage and WWF - bringing solar light and training village grandmothers to become solar engineers in rural Madagascar (2014).

Pencils of Promise - building 4 primary schools in rural Laos (2015).






By partnering with leading charities and organizations, Open Circles Foundation CONTRIBUTES to causes that desperately need our help.And we’re doing it again with this crowdfunding campaign - Save a Girl.


Right now we are calling on YOU FOR HELP!

The Power of Education 
Please join us to save young girls and break them free from slavery and abuse through the power of EDUCATION.


For our 2016 campaign, we’ve partnered with Room to Read, an award winning,  non-profit organization whose goals align with ours. Like us, they envision a world where all children can get access to quality education, reach their full potential and contribute to their community and the world.
Instead of a life of slavery, this 11-year-old girl - and so many others like her - will be free to receive the education she deserves. With YOUR help, she will avoid the horrific fate that looked inevitable and have a completely different life as a consequence. 
And the change will ripple through the community.
Once this 11-year-old girl breaks out of the Kamlari cycle, she'll be better educated and equipped to help others around her. 
It's not just about helping girls of this generation - by freeing and educating these girls, we're empowering them to change the future of their children and their community for generations to come. 


&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;
&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/p&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;
&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;h3&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;YOU are this Girl's ONLY Chance&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/h3&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;

How YOU Can Make a Difference

Any contribution gets us closer to giving another girl a future and helping her break free from slavery - but obviously the more you give, the more girls we can help.
One year of secondary education costs just €250 per girl, per year.
When you join us, together we can help raise enough money to help 1,000 girls break free of the cycle of poverty, abuse and hopelessness.


Just think about €250 for a moment… it’s the same as you’re charging for a few hours work, the cost of your kid’s game console or a couple of trips to the supermarket, right? 
For our 11-year-old Kamlari girl it’s the difference between a life of slavery, abuse and degradation and life of freedom, fulfillment and possibilities.

We have been close friends from our Oxford University days.Phạm Anh Sơn (left) and Mạc Duy Hải (right)We love technology and solving problems. We strongly believe in the power of technology to make life better. So we thought to ourselves, what can we do to make the ever-expanding Vietnamese community here in the UK better?So, what is the problem?
All SVUK forums/pages have always had a section for people to buy, sell, trade things and advertise their services. In recent times, it exists under the form of the Facebook event page SVUK Marketplace. However it has a lot of problems, among them:Sheer amount of posts and prioritisation of those with new likes and comments result in poor visibility for both advertisers and audienceThere is no reliable search or filter functionNotifications and messages do not always work out. If people are not Facebook friends, their messages may not go into the usual Inbox(for illustration purpose only)Lack of administration and accountability, especially when disputes happen. Posts can be deleted without a trace - even though SVUK is not responsible for resolving these disputes, it leaves a lot of buyers at a loss when they are in trouble
... and many more.The page, albeit very unusable and difficult to manage, is still extremely popular. This reflects a great demand for a good, central and free advertisement board among the Vietnamese society (notice: not just students) in the UK.We would like to gather a team of Vietnamese software engineers and build a new, better version of the SVUK Marketplace as a community project. We have codenamed this project ""Project Spring Roll"".What are we going to do?We will gather a team of Vietnamese software engineers and build the website from scratch.

For a start, we will not support these kinds of ads: essay-writers for hire, money transfers and similar ones since they are either usually questionable in morality or legality.Active development will start from now and we estimate that our first beta test will commence in 6 months' time.We said this would be free, so why is this campaign here?

</p><p>Project Mercy is located in Yetebon, an area of endemic poverty with very limited access to clean water, medical care, and education.  Beginning in 1993 Project Mercy has worked to address the critical needs of this community and have successfully developed infrastructure, started and maintained a hospital, and currently provide local children with a K-12 education. </p><p>There are nearly 1,600 children in the Yetabon area who attend school at Project Mercy.  Many of these children walk miles to school each day.  Because backpacks are not readily available, children either carry their supplies or use plastic bag as bookbags.  </p><p>In October 2013, <a href=""regis.edu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Regis University</a> School of Physical Therapy students arrived at Project Mercy for several weeks of volunteer work: teaching classes on health and wellness, providing physical therapy services, educating local care providers in basic medical and physical therapies, and even helping with school and hospital maintence. It has been an annual and sometimes semi-annual service trip which is highly anticipated by both Project Mercy staff and students as well as the Regis community.  But this year they had a special surprise for the students.  Each child at the school received an unexpected gift: a simple cinch bag!  A bright, sturdy, roomy bag to support each child's journey of receiving an education.  </p><p>Now we need your help.  Another group of physical therapy students will travel back to Yetebon in the fall of 2014.  It is our goal to continue to supply the students with cinch bags as well as basic supplies to fill those bags.   </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>We are reaching out to our family, friends, friends-of-friends, co-workers and YOU to help us support the cause Project Mercy stands for.

Now Help Us Fill it Up!Each year since 2007, students and faculty from the School of Physical Therapy at Regis University have traveled to Ethiopia in collaberation with Project Mercy, a non-profit international relief and development agency in southwest Ethiopia.   
Project Mercy is located in Yetebon, an area of endemic poverty with very limited access to clean water, medical care, and education.  Beginning in 1993 Project Mercy has worked to address the critical needs of this community and have successfully developed infrastructure, started and maintained a hospital, and currently provide local children with a K-12 education. There are nearly 1,600 children in the Yetabon area who attend school at Project Mercy.  Many of these children walk miles to school each day.  Because backpacks are not readily available, children either carry their supplies or use plastic bag as bookbags.  In October 2013, Regis University School of Physical Therapy students arrived at Project Mercy for several weeks of volunteer work: teaching classes on health and wellness, providing physical therapy services, educating local care providers in basic medical and physical therapies, and even helping with school and hospital maintence. It has been an annual and sometimes semi-annual service trip which is highly anticipated by both Project Mercy staff and students as well as the Regis community.  But this year they had a special surprise for the students.  Each child at the school received an unexpected gift: a simple cinch bag!  A bright, sturdy, roomy bag to support each child's journey of receiving an education.  Now we need your help.  Another group of physical therapy students will travel back to Yetebon in the fall of 2014.  It is our goal to continue to supply the students with cinch bags as well as basic supplies to fill those bags.   What We Need & What You GetWe are reaching out to our family, friends, friends-of-friends, co-workers and YOU to help us support the cause Project Mercy stands for. A school bag to a child at Project Mercy is an amazing gift and a smile on 1,600 children's faces is worth more than words can explain.Our goal is to raise $3,500 to help pay for the cinch school bags provided to all 1,600 students at Project Mercy. 100% of your donations will go directing towards offsetting the cost of the bags and supplies for the children. The ImpactLine up of 1,600 students with no idea what is about to happen, gifts are not common in Yetebon and therefore a very special thing.Time for bag hand out and to see all the children's faces light up!Such a simple gift made 1,600 children happy and worry free. They deserve an education and providing school bags will help them continue on their journey of learning the curiosities of the world. We thank you for helping us support this cause.Other Ways You Can HelpWe know that not everyone will be able to contribute financially to this cause but helping us spread the word towards continuing the educational project at Project Mercy, is a gift worth more then something money could buy. If you prefer you can support Project Mercy directly.

<h1>Talkin' 'bout a Revolution...<br/>
</h1>
<p>This winter, the coalition government in the UK announced sweeping changes to university tuition fees that set higher education in Britain to be the most expensive in Europe.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Students voiced their discontent in widespread protests that brought news footage into our homes reminiscent of the 70s and 80s; from horses charging marchers, to the windows of Conservative Party office being kicked in by an angry mob. However, one occupation's success at holding their University and generating amazing amounts of support suggested that <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">something different was happening here</span>.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We - directors Isis, Srdan and Ludo - are three filmmakers that have been with a group of University College London students with <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">a passion for change </span>since day one.  We have seen them come together and organize themselves using Twitter, Facebook and YouTube to make their belief in the fundamental right to an affordable education heard across the country and around the world.  Their occupation, a classic 60s sit-in with a Twitter-feed twist, has seen the beginning of <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">the strongest student movement in 40 years</span>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>From their first occupation right through to the huge protests across London on 26th March we have recorded these amazing characters create technology that will change the face of protest forever, as well as become friends.  We believe we have a story that both captures a moment in time and will have massive resonance for the future.  And <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">we need your help</span> to complete it. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h1>No Ifs, No Buts, We Need to Make Film Cuts!<br/>
</h1>We've shot hundreds of hours of footage right from the heart of the protests - with <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">unique and exclusive access </span>to our characters that hasn't been seen on any news programme or magazine article.  This film charts both the political and the personal to show the world that protest is vital, and can make a difference.<br/><br/>We want to tell this story of peaceful and innovative protest <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">as quickly and as broadly as possible</span>.  <br/><br/>By completing the film and showing it at festivals, on TV and in public screenings, we'll share a story and a world that means more today for a world in crisis than ever before. <br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h1>You &amp; Us, Not Them &amp; Us<br/>
</h1>
<p>So far, we've made this by the seat of our pants and with the support of our producers.  <span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">We've had no funding</span> and this has meant we've been free to capture the story as it happens, right at the heart of things.  But now we need to get down to it and edit all this great material!  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We're asking for you to help us reach our $10,000 target which will pay for our <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">super low budget post production </span>process - essentially an editing team to help us put the film together so that we can get it out there to you, to students across the world and to a broader audience that might normally dismiss such protests as cliched student antics, when we can see this is anything but. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We've put together a whole set of levels at which you can help us out - all with a fun educational twist - from a shiny gold star right up to a PhD in Real Social Networks, you can be part of a project that is charting changing the face of a generation. <br/></p>

</div></div>","Talkin' 'bout a Revolution...

This winter, the coalition government in the UK announced sweeping changes to university tuition fees that set higher education in Britain to be the most expensive in Europe.

Students voiced their discontent in widespread protests that brought news footage into our homes reminiscent of the 70s and 80s; from horses charging marchers, to the windows of Conservative Party office being kicked in by an angry mob. However, one occupation's success at holding their University and generating amazing amounts of support suggested that something different was happening here.

We - directors Isis, Srdan and Ludo - are three filmmakers that have been with a group of University College London students with a passion for change since day one.  We have seen them come together and organize themselves using Twitter, Facebook and YouTube to make their belief in the fundamental right to an affordable education heard across the country and around the world.  Their occupation, a classic 60s sit-in with a Twitter-feed twist, has seen the beginning of the strongest student movement in 40 years.

From their first occupation right through to the huge protests across London on 26th March we have recorded these amazing characters create technology that will change the face of protest forever, as well as become friends.  We believe we have a story that both captures a moment in time and will have massive resonance for the future.  And we need your help to complete it. 


No Ifs, No Buts, We Need to Make Film Cuts!
We've shot hundreds of hours of footage right from the heart of the protests - with unique and exclusive access to our characters that hasn't been seen on any news programme or magazine article.  This film charts both the political and the personal to show the world that protest is vital, and can make a difference.We want to tell this story of peaceful and innovative protest as quickly and as broadly as possible.  By completing the film and showing it at festivals, on TV and in public screenings, we'll share a story and a world that means more today for a world in crisis than ever before. 

You & Us, Not Them & Us

So far, we've made this by the seat of our pants and with the support of our producers.  

We've had no funding and this has meant we've been free to capture the story as it happens, right at the heart of things.  But now we need to get down to it and edit all this great material!  

We're asking for you to help us reach our $10,000 target which will pay for our super low budget post production process - essentially an editing team to help us put the film together so that we can get it out there to you, to students across the world and to a broader audience that might normally dismiss such protests as cliched student antics, when we can see this is anything but. 

We've put together a whole set of levels at which you can help us out - all with a fun educational twist - from a shiny gold star right up to a PhD in Real Social Networks, you can be part of a project that is charting changing the face of a generation.

To visually showcase an on-the-ground mission and ultimately raise awareness for displaced women and children. Join our journey to improve lives! </strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>The Background</strong></p>
<p>-               <strong><em>43 million</em></strong> people in the world are displaced by conflict</p>
<p>-               <strong><em>80%</em></strong> of these are women, children and youth</p>
<p>-               Most are displaced for an average of <strong><em>17 years</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Women’s Refugee Commission (WRC) Mission:</strong> <em>Our mission is to improve the lives and protect the rights of women, children and youth displaced by conflict and crisis. We research their needs, identify solutions and advocate for programs and policies to strengthen their resilience and drive change in humanitarian practice.</em></p>
<p>OKAY, GREAT! But…what does that really <em>mean</em>?</p>
<p>What does that research look like? How does that help WRC identify solutions? How are they actually helping people?</p>
<p>Our thoughts exactly.</p>
<p><strong>The Challenge </strong></p>
<p>The WRC has the unique challenge and opportunity to focus solely on research and advocacy.

<p>Rather than addressing individual problems, Women’s Refugee Commission seeks to address the<em> source</em> of these problems.</p>
<p>So we thought – instead of trying to explain all this, why not try to <em>show</em> it?</p>
<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Raise enough funds to sponsor a video journalist who will travel to a refugee camp alongside the Women’s Refugee Commission and document their research.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Hold a competition to find a video journalist who is willing to volunteer their time and talent for a cause.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Produce a video that helps the public <strong>ENVISION THE MISSION</strong> (i.e. a video that showcases both a real field-work mission and highlights how this contributes to the Women’s Refugee Commission primary mission, vision, and goals.)</p>

The Heart to Heart program
 brings a group of twenty Israeli teenagers to Canada every summer. Half
 of our participants identify as Palestinian Israeli, and half as Jewish
 Israeli. Upon arriving in Canada, the group spends two and a half weeks
 living together at Camp Shomria, an overnight summer camp near Ottawa. 
Daily activities include team-building workshops, camping trips, and 
facilitated dialogue about the narratives, politics, and power dynamics 
that participants face in their daily lives at home. The group also 
visits Parliament Hill in Ottawa, and spends four days living with 
Canadian host families while touring Toronto. The time spent in Canada 
is a focal point for the group, but it is complemented by workshops for 
participants at the Givat Haviva campus and in their respective 
communities leading up to and after their trip. Why We ExistHeart to Heart was founded in 2011 as a partnership between the Givat Haviva Education Foundation in Israel and Hashomer Hatzair/Camp Shomria in
 Canada. Givat Haviva is an Israeli non-profit organization dedicated to

divided groups in Israel. Givat Haviva ensures parity between

I’m Ukrainian and I live in Ivano-Frankivsk (Ukraine). Before I start talking
about my project let me tell you a couple of words about myself.</p>
<p>I’m a professional
translator. I work with French, English and Ukrainian languages. Ukrainian
being my native language, English and French I learned at the Ukrainian
National Schevchenko University. I graduated with a Master Degree in 2007. Then
I continued my studies in Paris, where I managed to improve my French. After my
studies I came back to Ukraine and started to work as translator. </p>
<p>I started translating books three
years ago, when I met sisters from the Incarnated Word Congregation (the
Servants of the Lord and the Virgin of Matara), who have one of  their convents in Ivano-Frankivsk. I
translated a children’s bible of the French author Sophie de Ségur and this
book was published recently (“La Bible de la Grand’Mère’’ or “Бабусина Біблія” in Ukrainian). At that time I started learning Spanish with the sisters
in order to translate books for them from Spanish as well. It appeared to be
quite easy after French language, and my Spanish teachers say I’d be able to
translate from Spanish soon. But of course I need to practice it.</p>
<p>….</p>
<p>Now I have an opportunity to
improve and practise Spanish: to go to Argentina and work as a volunteer in the
home for children run by the sisters Servants of the Lord and the Virgin of
Matara in San Rafael. The idea is, that helping sisters with their everyday
duties and communicating with children and sisters, I’d be able to improve my
Spanish and make it good enough to translate. I also hope to do something good
for these children, deprived of parents’ attention. I do really hope to get
myself a lesson of love in this place and to become a better person too. </p>
<p>…..</p>
<p>With the money I earned for
the translation and with some borrowed money I managed to buy a round trip
ticket to Argentina. More precisely, to Buenos Aires. The dates are the
following: going to Argentina on 1.03.2016 and come back to Ukraine on
26.05.2016.  And this is where I need
your help…</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>I need your financial
support to be able: to go to Kyiv and pay French visa fees  and inevitable visacenter fees (as our plane goes
through Paris where we stay one day) - around 86 USD; to come from my town Kyiv
to take a plane, round trip -20 USD;  to take a bus from Buenos Aires to San Raphael
(round trip) -156 USD; to take a bus (round trip) to go to Iguazu  waterfalls  or to visit San Carlos de
Bariloche -220 USD (which is just an option);  to buy things I need for the trip -200 USD; and to have some 300 USD with me (as I’m going to stay in a foreign country
for 3 months). Makes totally 982 USD. But in my fundraising campaign I’m
asking for 1200 USD. If I manage to raise all this money, I’ll buy souvenirs for
friends and family, and those who supported me in this adventure. Even if I don’t
raise this amount, every dollar or euro will be of a great help to me.</p>
<p>As to my potential sponsors, I promise to send a postcard from
Argentina or buy a small souvenir for those who will contribute to make this trip possible . But now, even before I left, I can send you
the book of Sophie de Ségur ‘’La Bible de la Grand’Mere’’, which I translated
into Ukrainian. </p>
<p>….</p>
<p>You might wonder in what way
my trip to Argentina can be useful for people or for You personally. I hope
that the book that I’ve translated, and those I’ll translate in the future,
will be read by adults and children. 
Hope that some of them will learn something new or find answers to some of
their questions. You might say that since I’m translating into Ukrainian (for
now), I’d better ask Ukrainians to help me with the trip. I did ask my friends
and they helped me to pay the entire price of the ticket. But honestly, a trip
to Argentina is pretty expensive for most of Ukrainians. Please don’t think that I
want somebody else to pay my trip, it’s just I couldn’t earn more by myself,
unfortunately. And of course, being a volunteer, I don’t have an obligation to
go anywhere else in Argentina (see Iguazu waterfalls or  any other sightseeing), but Argentina is so
far away and expensive for Ukrainians, that I’m not sure I’ll get back there
soon or at all.</p>
<p>If you can’t support me
financially, but you  know somebody who might help, please share this information
with this person. Your prayers will be also appreciated. Thank you.

<h2><b>OUR IDEA</b></h2>
<p><b>_____________________________________________________________________________</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">What Do You Know?</b><br/></p>
<p>Think about this: Millions of experienced industrial and technical professionals all around the globe have accumulated a huge amount of knowledge…and most of it is just sitting unused on their computers! </p>
<p>How valuable would all that idle knowledge be if those professionals had a simple, streamlined way to share it with each other?</p>
<p><b>Fact #1:  <i>All over the world, individuals have stores of Idle Knowledge Inventory.</i></b></p>
<p><b>Fact #2:  <i>Everyone knows something.  Someone needs what you know.</i></b></p>
<p><b>Fact #3:  <i>Knowledge is a commodity that can be “MINED”</i></b></p>
<p><b>Fact #4:  <i>Opportunities abound in the shared economy (Airbnb and Uber have proven this!)  </i></b></p>
<p>3pdoc is a Global Sharing Resource for Industrial and Technical Professionals.  Our prototype website, opening November 20th, 2015, allows professionals in any industry to search, buy and sell copyright-free plans, policies, and procedures in editable format (see more details below).</p>
<p>But we have an even <b>BIGGER</b>, <b>BOLDER</b>, <b>GAME-CHANGING</b> idea based on the four facts above. We are raising funds to build the infrastructure for our patent-pending, fully collaborative “Knowledge Mining Community” that will revolutionize the future of document sharing worldwide!</p>
<p><b>____________________________________________________________________________</b></p>
<h2><b>THE KNOWLEDGE MINING GOLD RUSH</b></h2>
<p><b>____________________________________________________________________________</b></p>
<p>It is widely accepted that information is now the world’s most valuable currency. This means the global Idle Knowledge Inventory represents a virtual gold mine! Our vision for the next generation of 3pdoc is to: provide a unique, collaborative organization for our customers; help users build their own communities within specific areas of knowledge; market and promote our patent-pending knowledge claim structure; and expand revenue-generating opportunities for EVERYONE. Here are the various ways that community members can participate in 3pdoc’s Knowledge Mining Gold Rush:</p>
<h3>Claim Holders</h3>
<p><b><i>Claim holders “Stake their Claim”</i></b> to an exclusive body of knowledge and lease that claim each year for $99.  Claim Holders receive a Certificate of Claim with a unique numerical identifier, which reserves the exclusive rights to their knowledge territory and protects against claim jumpers. Examples of a Knowledge Claim may be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Asbestos Abatement, California</p></li>
<li><p>Infectious Diseases – Ebola</p></li>
<li><p>Oil Field Preventative Maintenance, Texas</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>As a 3pdoc Claim Holder in good standing, you can:</i></b></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Invite up to 150 “Miners” to join your claim and sell their documents in your territory</p></li>
<li><p>Approve all documents sold within your Claim</p></li>
<li><p>Release Miners from your Claim  </p></li>
<li><p>Earn 5% of the purchase price for every document sold by one of your “Miners”</p></li>
<li><p>Earn 70% of the purchase price for every document that you sell, personally</p></li>
<li><p>Purchase and manage multiple Claims</p></li>
<li><p>Have all your upload fees waived </p></li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>Maintaining a Claim</i></b></p>
<p>Of course, as a Claim Holder, you must take care of your Miners and maintain your territory.  We wouldn’t want all that Idle Knowledge to be, well… Idle!  So you’ll need to agree to a few standards to keep your Claim status.  Don’t worry, they’re just common sense to a successful businessman or businesswoman like yourself! Things like promoting your Claim (your Miners can help), maintaining a minimum level feedback rating, minimizing the backlog of documents requiring approval, taking care of your customers, and so on.</p>
<h3><b>Miners</b></h3>
<p>Miners apply through the 3pdoc portal and are invited to join a Claim by the Claim Holder.  They have documents to sell that are relevant to the Knowledge Claim.  As a Miner:  </p>
<ul>
<li><p>You receive 70% of the purchase price of every document you sell</p></li>
<li><p>Your products will enjoy special promotion by 3pdoc and the Claim Holder as part of the Knowledge Claim category</p></li>
<li><p>Your uploads are all free!</p></li>
<li><p>You can belong to multiple Knowledge Claims</p></li>
</ul>
<p><b><i>Miner Responsibilities</i></b></p>
<p>Miners have their duties, too!  To help your Claim Holder be a success and support your mining community, you need to do your part by: </p>
<ul>
<li><p>Participating in marketing the Claim through blogs, posts, tweets, etc. </p></li>
<li><p>Maintaining a minimum average customer feedback rating</p></li>
<li><p>Resolving customer complaints in a timely manner</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Miners can be released from a Claim for not meeting minimum requirements of performance or quality.</p>
<h3>Prospectors</h3>
<p>Prospectors are independent.  They sell their documents but are not affiliated with a Knowledge Claim.  Miners who have documents not related to a Claim to which they belong, may also sell them under the Prospector category.  </p>
<p><b><i>As a Prospector, you:</i></b></p>
<ul><li><p>Receive 70% of the purchase price of every document you sell</p></li></ul>
<p><b><i>Prospector Responsibilities:</i></b></p>
<ul><li><p>Resolve customer complaints in a timely manner</p></li></ul>

<h2><b>WHAT WE HAVE NOW</b></h2>
<p><b>_____________________________________________________________________________</b></p>
<p><b><i>The current 3pdoc prototype website (opening November 20th, 2015)</i></b> allows professionals in any industry to search, buy and sell copyright-free plans, policies, and procedures in editable format.  It was designed to reduce the cycle-time used daily in every company around the world to produce documents meeting regulatory and business requirements, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>New ventures</p></li>
<li><p>New clients</p></li>
<li><p>Regulatory compliance</p></li>
<li><p>Business requirements</p></li>
<li><p>Sales Initiatives</p></li>
<li><p>And more….</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Our pioneering website eliminates the tedious, time-consuming methods of the past and makes your job so much easier! It’s the end of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Searching the internet;</p></li>
<li><p>Downloading PDF documents;</p></li>
<li><p>Converting them to Word</p></li>
<li><p>Merging several together to fit your needs; and,</p></li>
<li><p>Fighting embedded formatting</p></li>
</ul>
<p>…just to produce a useful document that legally leverages the expertise of other industrial and technical professionals.</p>
<p>3pdoc makes it easy to search and find the documents you need with <b>no copyrights and in editable format!</b> And once you tweak the document for your specific purpose, you can <b><i>turn around and re-sell it!</i></b></p>

OUR IDEA
_____________________________________________________________________________

What Do You Know?
Think about this: Millions of experienced industrial and technical professionals all around the globe have accumulated a huge amount of knowledge…and most of it is just sitting unused on their computers! 
How valuable would all that idle knowledge be if those professionals had a simple, streamlined way to share it with each other?
Fact #1:  All over the world, individuals have stores of Idle Knowledge Inventory.
Fact #2:  Everyone knows something.  Someone needs what you know.
Fact #3:  Knowledge is a commodity that can be “MINED”
Fact #4:  Opportunities abound in the shared economy (Airbnb and Uber have proven this!)  
3pdoc is a Global Sharing Resource for Industrial and Technical Professionals.  Our prototype website, opening November 20th, 2015, allows professionals in any industry to search, buy and sell copyright-free plans, policies, and procedures in editable format (see more details below).
But we have an even BIGGER, BOLDER, GAME-CHANGING idea based on the four facts above. We are raising funds to build the infrastructure for our patent-pending, fully collaborative “Knowledge Mining Community” that will revolutionize the future of document sharing worldwide!
____________________________________________________________________________
THE KNOWLEDGE MINING GOLD RUSH
____________________________________________________________________________
It is widely accepted that information is now the world’s most valuable currency. This means the global Idle Knowledge Inventory represents a virtual gold mine! Our vision for the next generation of 3pdoc is to: provide a unique, collaborative organization for our customers; help users build their own communities within specific areas of knowledge; market and promote our patent-pending knowledge claim structure; and expand revenue-generating opportunities for EVERYONE. Here are the various ways that community members can participate in 3pdoc’s Knowledge Mining Gold Rush:
Claim Holders
Claim holders “Stake their Claim” to an exclusive body of knowledge and lease that claim each year for $99.  Claim Holders receive a Certificate of Claim with a unique numerical identifier, which reserves the exclusive rights to their knowledge territory and protects against claim jumpers. Examples of a Knowledge Claim may be:

Asbestos Abatement, California
Infectious Diseases – Ebola
Oil Field Preventative Maintenance, Texas

As a 3pdoc Claim Holder in good standing, you can:

Invite up to 150 “Miners” to join your claim and sell their documents in your territory
Approve all documents sold within your Claim
Release Miners from your Claim  
Earn 5% of the purchase price for every document sold by one of your “Miners”
Earn 70% of the purchase price for every document that you sell, personally
Purchase and manage multiple Claims
Have all your upload fees waived 

Maintaining a Claim
Of course, as a Claim Holder, you must take care of your Miners and maintain your territory.  We wouldn’t want all that Idle Knowledge to be, well… Idle!  So you’ll need to agree to a few standards to keep your Claim status.  Don’t worry, they’re just common sense to a successful businessman or businesswoman like yourself! Things like promoting your Claim (your Miners can help), maintaining a minimum level feedback rating, minimizing the backlog of documents requiring approval, taking care of your customers, and so on.
Miners
Miners apply through the 3pdoc portal and are invited to join a Claim by the Claim Holder.  They have documents to sell that are relevant to the Knowledge Claim.  As a Miner:  

You receive 70% of the purchase price of every document you sell
Your products will enjoy special promotion by 3pdoc and the Claim Holder as part of the Knowledge Claim category
Your uploads are all free!
You can belong to multiple Knowledge Claims

Miner Responsibilities
Miners have their duties, too!  To help your Claim Holder be a success and support your mining community, you need to do your part by: 

Participating in marketing the Claim through blogs, posts, tweets, etc. 
Maintaining a minimum average customer feedback rating
Resolving customer complaints in a timely manner

Miners can be released from a Claim for not meeting minimum requirements of performance or quality.
Prospectors
Prospectors are independent.  They sell their documents but are not affiliated with a Knowledge Claim.  Miners who have documents not related to a Claim to which they belong, may also sell them under the Prospector category.  
As a Prospector, you:
Receive 70% of the purchase price of every document you sell
Prospector Responsibilities:
Resolve customer complaints in a timely manner


____________________________________________________________________________
WHAT WE HAVE NOW
_____________________________________________________________________________
The current 3pdoc prototype website (opening November 20th, 2015) allows professionals in any industry to search, buy and sell copyright-free plans, policies, and procedures in editable format.  It was designed to reduce the cycle-time used daily in every company around the world to produce documents meeting regulatory and business requirements, such as:

New ventures
New clients
Regulatory compliance
Business requirements
Sales Initiatives
And more….

Our pioneering website eliminates the tedious, time-consuming methods of the past and makes your job so much easier! It’s the end of:

Searching the internet;
Downloading PDF documents;
Converting them to Word
Merging several together to fit your needs; and,
Fighting embedded formatting

…just to produce a useful document that legally leverages the expertise of other industrial and technical professionals.
3pdoc makes it easy to search and find the documents you need with no copyrights and in editable format! And once you tweak the document for your specific purpose, you can turn around and re-sell it!

<p><b>Who
We Are</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our names are Michael, Matt, Aron, and Carl, and we
are a group of students at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville working to
promote the Shooting for Women Alliance (SFWA) in order to help them raise
money for resources that they need. More specifically, we are attempting to
raise $1,000 to aid them in acquiring ammunition, travel expenses to
conferences, office supplies, and gun cleaning supplies. </p>
<p>Shooting for Women Alliance, founded in 2003 by Susan and
Rob Rexrode, was inspired by Susan’s horrifying experience of being held
hostage at knifepoint in her home for five hours, and then stalked for two
years afterwards. After this, she decided to dedicate her life to the education
of women, as well as men and youth, in self-defense in the form of firearms, and
to the enjoyment of shooting sports.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1350403/files/20150402155516-10931110_10152608803352011_4667923389449035269_n.jpg?1428015316"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><i>(Susan

<p>SFWA is in need of cleaning supplies for their training

lodging, airline tickets, and registration fees. Finally, we need to raise

Being able to utilize the five senses is something that people often take for granted. Unfortunately for much of the special needs community, the use of the senses and some fundamental skills are not simple accomplishments. We are Binghamton University students raising money for ACHIEVE. This facility provides many opportunities for people who face challenges because of their various disabilities. ACHIEVE makes it possible for these individuals to have a sense of normalcy and be able to participate in activities that match their skill and interest levels. Individuals at ACHIEVE are often able to work and volunteer in the community, as well as interact with other people who have similar special needs. ACHIEVE is a valuable resource for people with developmental, physical, intellectual and other disabilities in Tioga and Broome counties. This organization has been the largest voluntary provider of opportunities and services for individuals with disabilities in this area for the past 64 years. The goal of ACHIEVE is to advocate for people with varying disabilities and provide an augmented quality of life for these members of the community.

<p>I’m Zouhir
Chahoud and I’m a Software Engineer who wants to help Syrian refugees, as
well as refugees from other Arabic-speaking countries gain a living on their
own.</p>
<p>By now, I’m sure
everyone has already heard about their plight: forced by wars that seem
unending to flee their homes, these refugees have suddenly found themselves in
countries they know very little about, without speaking the language and with
very little chances of getting a job there.</p>
<p>So far, more
than <b>two million refugees have entered Europe
alone</b> in 2015 and the beginning of 2016, which has led to what is now
generically called “Europe’s immigration crisis”. Aside from the stunning two
million, other millions of refugees (primarily Syrian, Afghan and Irakian) are
now in Turkey, Jordan or Lebanon.</p><p></p><p>Sadly, the
governments of the countries currently hosting refugees are overwhelmed by the
influx, which creates severe economic and social pressure. Perhaps the hardest
task these governments have to face is integrating the refugees who don’t speak
the local language into the workforce. Luckily, <b>JavaScript is a universal language </b>and, more importantly, it’s a
language that, once learnt, it can help immigrants HELP THEMSELVES.</p><p><b>My plan:</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1465566297/Timeline_wxu28s.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>There are
countless NGOs that work alongside governments in all countries that harbor
immigrants to help them with basic necessities like food, clothing and shelter.
However, this is not something that can be sustained in the long run. If we
join hands, we can actually do something that will help immigrants make a
living for themselves.</p>
<p>Briefly put, I
intend to teach all Arabic-speaking immigrants JavaScript for free, in their
mother tongue. <b>Within six months</b>,
they should be able to land their first entry-level job or their first
freelancing gig. Afterwards, the sky is the limit!</p>
<p>In order to
support my students, I plan to have various articles on JavaScript and
programming in general translated into Arabic, as well as counsel them on soft
skills they need to get a job or a freelancing gig..</p>
<p><b>Why JavaScript?</b></p>
<p>Aside from my
love for it, I chose JavaScript because:</p>
<p>-  It’s the programming language of
the future</p>
<p>-  It’s very versatile: you can
apps for web, iOS and Android mobile platforms as well as OSX, Linux, and
Windows computer</p>
<p>-  According to a recent 2016 <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">StackOverflow survey</a>, up to 69% of software developers are self-taught
and they still make more money than some computer science graduates</p>
<p>-  It’s easy to learn and use – at least at a basic level</p>
<p><b>Your Contribution</b></p>
<p>As an Arabic
speaker, I can prepare the course material in this language as well as interact
with the students as often as they need me to. There is a limit to the time I
can allocate to this, as well as to the funds, so this is where you come in:</p>
<p>- Translating
articles and tutorials hand-picked by me, as well as white papers from English
to Arabic with a freelance translator. The Internet is filled with amazing
resources, but so few of them are in Arabic and I plan to change that!</p>
<p>- Some of the greatest minds behind excellent frameworks have written
articles, e-books and white papers -- all types of content that would be
extremely beneficial and motivating for students if we can translate them into
Arabic</p>
<p>-  Getting respected members of the
JavaScript community to record guests course and translating them into Arabic</p>
<p>-  Recording equipment</p>
<p>-  Paying for the platform and
learning management system hosting resources as the scale of this project is bound
to grow and we will need sturdy solutions.</p>
<p><b>Together, we can
help refugees EMPOWER themselves!</b></p>
<p><b>The beginning</b></p>
<p>When I first had
this idea, I didn’t think that I would get such an amazing and overwhelming
response.</p>
<p>My initial
announcement was re-tweeted over 185 times in the first 24 hours. People that I
admire a lot supported my initiative: the founder of Elastic, CouchDB and
JSConfeu maker, O’Reilly book author Eric Elliott and Google Engineer Addy
Osmani  — thank you, guys, your support means the world to me!</p>
<p>In the same 24
hours, I already got 35 responses from people who are serious about learning
JavaScript and want to commit. I am so happy to see the interest this has
generated, more than I had ever hoped it would. So, my initiative seems bound
to turn into something much bigger. I plan to setup a platform where we can all
communicate, exchange information and get to know each other — I can no longer
simply rely on Skype, as I had planned. Plus, I will create video courses in
Arabic, I’ll translate some must-see ones in English and create written code
and demos, as well.</p>
<p><b>About myself</b></p>
<p>My name is
Zouhir, I was born and raised in Syria. I’m currently a Consultant Software
Engineer based at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the country’s leading
bank. But more important than my job is my passion for science and for
education. At the age of 17, I won a national web programming award and I was a
physics pioneer for two years in a row before that.</p>
<p>I strongly
believe that my passion for the right kind of education is what put me on the
path that I am now and that I absolutely love, so it is time for me to give
something back. I am a fluent Arabic, English and JavaScript speaker and I am
more than happy to combine these three skills in order to help people who
desperately need some stability in their lives right now.</p>

<p><strong>Who I Am<br/><br/></strong>Born and raised in rural Wyoming, I thought I knew something about about being isolated.  We didn't have a street light or a retail outlet of any kind.  Then in 2010, I went to Thailand where I learned the cold realities that the peoples of the developing world face. I knew the Hmong language from previous work I had done in San Diego with Hmong refugees, so I was in a position to help.  I became acquainted with Baan Ayui--a school commited to ending human trafficking in northern Thailand.   With a committed founder (you're awesome, Sue) and a great model, they have the potential to help the poorest families fend off the lurking threat of traffickers. <br/><br/>At the end of the day, I'm just a guy.  I don't own an NGO, and I don't draw a salary from this.  Donate.  You'll be glad you did.  I will post pictures of the product once it is purchased. </p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Who They are</span></strong></p>
<p>The Ayui Foundation is an organization established in Chiang Rai province, Northern Thailand that provides a hostel (Baan Ayui) and educational support for poor, vulnerable, at-risk, ethnic Akha hilltribe teenagers, promoting the importance of education. We support both boys and girls aged 10 and older. We focus on providing practical support, educational opportunities and a safe, warm and loving environment for Akha hilltribe adolescents. </p>
<p><strong>Baan Ayui <br/></strong></p>
<p>Baan Ayui is run on a day-to-day basis by an Akha couple who live with the children. The children have daily chores and weekly activities include: discussion groups on topics related to hilltribes and teens; hostel meetings; traditional Akha embroidery; Akha songs and dances; guitar lessons and Thai, computer, art and English lessons from volunteers. Baan Ayui works to instill pride in cultural heritage, imbed the importance of education and actively assist with identifying and achieving future pathways for each house member after graduation.</p>
<p><strong>The Akha Hilltribe</strong></p>
<p>The Akha hilltribe is one of the nine main ethnic minority groups living in the mountainous Northern provinces of Thailand. They originated from China and settled in Chiang Rai province over 250 years ago, however, they still exist as a minority group who are often treated as second-class citizens. Economic hardship stems from being forced to join a cash economy after centuries of relying on barter economy and being self-reliant farmers, producing their own food and clothing. Many Akha people lack proper legal documentation to make them eligible for Thai citizenship and are considered illegal immigrants, even in the country of their birth. Without legal documents and citizenship, many Akha people cannot obtain a driving license or school graduation records, and cannot open bank accounts, rent/buy housing or take any legal action if they are exploited by employers. Limited land and government forest restrictions means many Akha people now do hired manual labor to support their families.</p>
<p>As each hilltribe has its own distinct language and culture, the Thai language is not their mother tongue, which makes school more difficult for hilltribe children. Educational opportunities are limited in many hilltribe villages and there are great social problems facing their communities, including drug use, drug trafficking, HIV/AIDS, prostitution and exploitation.</p>
<p><strong>Our Students</strong></p>
<p>For the 2013 school year, we have 18 Akha youth (5 boys and 13 girls) living at Baan Ayui. The children come from poor backgrounds, many from single-parent families whose parents have separated, or with one parent dead or in jail. Living at the hostel decreases the financial burden on their families, and many of the children would have no place to live if we had not taken them in. Some of the children have been cared for by the Foundation since it’s establishment 7 years ago. The students’ education levels range from Grade 5 to high school. Some students are in grades below their age level as they are placed according to their Thai language skills.</p>
<p><strong>Our Request</strong> </p>
<p>We are looking to replace our 2 secondhand laptops that are showing their age, and requesting at least 2 personal computers for the children to use when doing homework assignments. We have a printer and internet connection and currently have one PC.</p>

This year, Scientista was named by Enable Education as a ""Top 12 Amazing Organization for Women in STEM.""  


Our co-founders, Julia and Christina, have spoken at conferences such as the Harvard Women's Leadership Conference, the Association for Physical Sciences (APS) Conference, and the Rosalind Franklin Society Board Meeting.


HELP US LAUNCH our Inaugural Scientista Symposium - April 5th, 2014 at MIT in Cambridge, MA
Our next goal for achieving our mission is to launch our first conference, the Scientista Symposium on April 5, 2014.  The symposium will be an invaluable experience for undergraduate women in STEM to network with professionals and peers, present their research, and hear inspirational panel discussions and speeches about women in STEM. The Symposium is being held on MIT's campus and includes a full day of speaker panels, networking, and presentations by STEM professionals.  The keynote address is by media icon Elise Andrew, creator of the ""I F*cking Love Science"" Facebook page and YouTube channel.  Check out our conference website!  http://www.scientistafoundation.com/symposium-2014.htmlWhat Will the Symposium Achieve?

Professional-to-Student Networking: Students will have the opportunity to interact directly with our corporate sponsors companies to learn about different fields of work in STEM and career opportunities. Professionals also have an opportunity to sit with students during lunch and breakout time blocks.

Research Symposium: Students have unique opportunity to present their research and win a first place, second place, and honorable mention cash prizes.  Through the symposium, they will also develop and practice their presentation skills.
Academic and Professional Growth – TED-style talks and panel discussions from prominent women and men in science will highlight key issues in science, career development, and issues relating to women in science.
Intercollegiate networking opportunities: Students across the nation will meet, share ideas about their fields of study and past work experiences, and partake in interactive discussions.
How Else Can You Get Involved?There are multiple ways to join us in achieving our mission!  Help us spread the word about the Scientista Foundation and our April Symposium.  You can also tweet or retweet us, “like” and share our facebook page, and share our Indiegogo campaign with friends!  You can also share our project and mission with blogs or other organizations involved with women in STEM issues.Please don't hesitate to contact us with any questions at contact@scientistafoundation.com.

<p></p>
<p>UpBeat NYC is dedicated to the betterment
of South Bronx children’s lives through transformative musical experience. We
believe that there is no more effective investment in a community’s present and
future than the cultivation of its children’s well-being and happiness and that
music has a unique role to play in developing children as powerful agents of
their community’s improvement. UpBeat’s priority is to enable children to
realize and act on their ability to shape their own lives and contribute to the
vibrancy of their family and community. There is an opportunity in the South
Bronx to facilitate a collaboration of families and musicians with the aim of
elevating local children and in turn the entire community through artistic
achievement.</p>
<p></p><b><br/>What We Need</b><br/><p></p>Through years of hard work,
UpBeat’s success has been built by passionate volunteer musicians and families
who believe no obstacle should stand in the way of a child’s musical experience
and education. We started this work with no funding and will continue it
regardless of our future fundraising results. That said, the number of students
we reach and the quality of experience we are able to provide them is very
dependent on the financial support we secure. Below are a few of the things
that your contributions will support and that will help take this program to
the next level. 

<p></p>
<p><i>Special Workshops</i><br/></p><p>This fall we were able to hold several workshops with
master teachers in which students made great leaps forward.<span>  After one such workshop on a recent
Saturday morning, one student told us, “That was so great! We should do this
every week!” We would love to offer more special events and workshops to our
participants and your contribution can make that happen!</span> <br/></p><p><i>Transportation</i></p>
<p>Being in one of the great musical cities of the
world, there are lots of opportunities for our kids to be exposed to great
music and musical events. But because there are so many of us and such limited
resources, the cost of travel often keeps us home. Even subway trips to places
like Carnegie Hall, which invites us to free concerts, are at times impossible
for many of our kids due to their family’s tight budgets. Workshops like our
planned collaboration with the Corona Youth Music Project in Queens will not be
possible without funding to charter a bus.</p>
<p><i>Instruments</i></p>
<p>An orchestral music program is impossible without
instruments – lots of instruments. This can be a very significant cost.
Fortunately, UpBeat has received thousands of dollars worth of instruments from
generous New Yorkers seeking a worthy home for there violin, cello, clarinet,
etc. But these donations do not always keep up with our needs, and we are often
in the position of having to purchase used instruments. Maintenance and repairs
also present ongoing costs that add up to significant amounts over the course
of a year. </p>
<p><i>Expert
Teachers</i></p>
<p>The teachers we hire to work with our youngest
violinists (ages 5-8) are highly trained specialists who meticulously coach
their students in correct posture and technique, laying the foundation for a
lifetime of healthy playing habits. At the same time, they are instilling in
them the joy of music making and the values of teamwork and musical
excellence.<span>  These carefully
prepared students will go on to form the backbone of the UpBeat NYC Youth

Ethos educational model brings together Transformative (student’s meaning perspective’) and Constructivist (student’s existing knowledge developed by experience) Education rooted in Project Based Learning (a collaborative with community based organizations). Ethos uses multiple perspectives, and multiple modes of representation in teaching Common Core and Social Emotional Learning Standards. Ethos addresses systemic social, academic and financial strategies for developing a<br/>workable and sustainable Transformative new public school for Oakland.</p><p>Ethos Academy design is driven by the belief that students learn most effectively when supports for social, emotional, and academic development are incorporated into the structure and design of the school environment. These intensive personalized relationships form a core for how every student is educated and supported through<br/>self-selected tasks and self-directed projects. The structure is designed to support all students, inclusive of all learning styles with particular attention given to skill level challenges and formal and informal diagnoses. </p><p><u>Who Does Ethos Serve? </u></p><p>Ethos will serve families in the greater Oakland area and all students are welcome. Ethos school and campus systems are designed to support Individualized Education Plans (IEP) and Individualized Learning Plans (ILP) as best practices for all student academic matriculation. <i>Students of informal and formal designated diagnoses (particularly students with the diagnoses of Autism Spectrum and related challenges)</i> will have a viable alternative to traditional school structure, assuring consistent appropriate support: </p><p><span>•<span>  </span></span>Guided by curriculum standards student initiate subject area activities and tasks, generated as independent ideas</p><p><span>•<span>  </span></span>Student learning style Counter Story Telling (verbally and documented) are used with instructional detail in an organized, sequential manner</p><p><span>•<span>  </span></span>Project planning support to master time management and organizational collaboration necessary for completion</p><p><u>How Is Ethos Distinct? </u></p><p>“Each child is a unique person, with unique needs, and the purpose of the educational system of this state is to enable each child to develop all of his or her own potential.”—Ed Code 33080</p><p>Ethos Academy Charter School forwards the mission of the Oakland Unified School District by offering an academic model driven by the conviction that “Education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the legitimate goals of his life… We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character--that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living (Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.).” Consistent with the California State Board of Education, Ethos Academy commitment is to ensure that all students will attain the highest level of 21<sup>st </sup>Century academic knowledge, applied learning and performance skills to ensure fulfilling personal lives and careers and contribute to civic and economic progress in our diverse and changing democratic society.</p><p>The mission of Ethos Academy is to prepare students to be self-aware, responsible, life-long learners, motivated to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing world.  We develop future leaders by expecting academic excellence, enhancing critical and creative thinking skills, cultivating curiosity, and fostering social and emotional development in a nurturing and caring community.  Our mission is supported by<br/>five core values: </p><p><span>•<span> </span></span>Personal Discovery: of the basic structures in which each student gains awareness of what they know, how they think, and act in the world through in-depth self-inquiry for Personal Transformation.</p><p><span>•<span> </span></span>Community Shifts in Awareness: guides individual student Transformation to develop their understanding of the strengths and challenges within themselves and others to create a supportive, workable and sustainable learning community and school structure. </p><p><span>•<span> </span></span>Connectedness/ Community: builds partnership with peers as fellow students and adults as educators who are also students of the larger academic community, through reciprocal teaching and learning.</p><p><span>•<span> </span></span>Knowledge Constructivism: provides new opportunities for students from diverse and traditionally low performing backgrounds to contribute legitimate counter story and prior knowledge to supportive learning environment. </p><p>Ethos Academy educational vision is rooted in constructivist learning theory, informed by neuroscience research, and pedagogical best practices. Instruction at Ethos Academy is based on a dynamic inquiry-based approach to teaching and learning. Ethos stand is that Constructivist Learning and Teaching as an academic social construct <i>develops strong student learning identity</i> rooted in Transformative Research Design (Mertens, 2009): </p><p><span>•<span> </span></span>Underlying assumptions that rely on ethical stances of inclusion and challenge oppressive social structures. </p><p><span>•<span> </span></span>An entry process into the community that is designed to build trust and make goals and strategies transparent. </p><p><span>•<span> </span></span>Dissemination of findings in ways that encourage use of the results to enhance social justice and human rights. </p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p><ul>

These are the skills we all need to handle ourselves, our relationships and our work effectively and<br/>ethically.<span>  These competencies will to be taught and developed in our students and modeled by adults in classrooms, school and throughout our system. Social Emotional Learning is not separate from academic learning but, in fact, is critical to the transition to and effectiveness of developing the conditions to engaging instructional practices needed to teach academic content through the Common Core State Standards.<span>  </span></span></p><p>The Five Social Emotional Learning Competencies:</p><p><b>Self Awareness</b> (labeling one’s feelings; relating feelings and thoughts to behavior; accurate self-assessment of strengths/limitations; self-efficacy; optimism) <span><span><br/></span></span><b>Self-Management</b> (regulating one’s emotions; managing stress; self-control; self-motivation; setting and achieving goals)<span>  </span><span><span><br/></span></span><b>Social Awareness</b> (perspective-taking; empathy; understanding the socio-historical<br/>context of diversity; understanding social and ethical norms for behavior; recognizing family, school and community supports) <span><span><br/></span></span><b>Relationship Skills</b> (building relationships with diverse individuals/groups; communicating clearly; working cooperatively; resolving conflicts; seeking help) <span><span><br/></span></span><b>Responsible Decision Making</b> (considering the well-being of self and others;<br/>basing decisions on safety, social and ethical considerations; making constructive, safe choices about self, relationships and school).</p><p>FOUNDERS BIOS ALPHATIZED::<br/><br/><b>Dr.Gilberto Ariaza </b>graduated from the University of California at Berkeley, Social and Cultural Studies at the College of Education.

</ul><p></p><p>And that’s all there is to it.</p></div>","Short SummaryETHOS ACADEMY EXECUTIVE SUMMARYPrimary Founders: Dr. Courteny Gumora, Sage Moore, Lydia RoppMission & Vision Overview ETHOS Academy Charter School is a public school that will serve Ninth through Twelve grade students of the East Bay, Alameda County in the Oakland Unified School District, located in the thriving Downtown Oakland Community. Ethos educational model brings together Transformative (student’s meaning perspective’) and Constructivist (student’s existing knowledge developed by experience) Education rooted in Project Based Learning (a collaborative with community based organizations). Ethos uses multiple perspectives, and multiple modes of representation in teaching Common Core and Social Emotional Learning Standards. Ethos addresses systemic social, academic and financial strategies for developing aworkable and sustainable Transformative new public school for Oakland.Ethos Academy design is driven by the belief that students learn most effectively when supports for social, emotional, and academic development are incorporated into the structure and design of the school environment. These intensive personalized relationships form a core for how every student is educated and supported throughself-selected tasks and self-directed projects. The structure is designed to support all students, inclusive of all learning styles with particular attention given to skill level challenges and formal and informal diagnoses. Who Does Ethos Serve? Ethos will serve families in the greater Oakland area and all students are welcome. Ethos school and campus systems are designed to support Individualized Education Plans (IEP) and Individualized Learning Plans (ILP) as best practices for all student academic matriculation. Students of informal and formal designated diagnoses (particularly students with the diagnoses of Autism Spectrum and related challenges) will have a viable alternative to traditional school structure, assuring consistent appropriate support: •  Guided by curriculum standards student initiate subject area activities and tasks, generated as independent ideas•  Student learning style Counter Story Telling (verbally and documented) are used with instructional detail in an organized, sequential manner•  Project planning support to master time management and organizational collaboration necessary for completionHow Is Ethos Distinct? “Each child is a unique person, with unique needs, and the purpose of the educational system of this state is to enable each child to develop all of his or her own potential.”—Ed Code 33080Ethos Academy Charter School forwards the mission of the Oakland Unified School District by offering an academic model driven by the conviction that “Education has a two-fold function to perform in the life of man and in society: the one is utility and the other is culture. Education must enable a man to become more efficient, to achieve with increasing facility the legitimate goals of his life… We must remember that intelligence is not enough. Intelligence plus character--that is the goal of true education. The complete education gives one not only power of concentration, but worthy objectives upon which to concentrate. The broad education will, therefore, transmit to one not only the accumulated knowledge of the race but also the accumulated experience of social living (Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.).” Consistent with the California State Board of Education, Ethos Academy commitment is to ensure that all students will attain the highest level of 21st Century academic knowledge, applied learning and performance skills to ensure fulfilling personal lives and careers and contribute to civic and economic progress in our diverse and changing democratic society.The mission of Ethos Academy is to prepare students to be self-aware, responsible, life-long learners, motivated to meet the challenges of a rapidly changing world.  We develop future leaders by expecting academic excellence, enhancing critical and creative thinking skills, cultivating curiosity, and fostering social and emotional development in a nurturing and caring community.  Our mission is supported byfive core values: • Personal Discovery: of the basic structures in which each student gains awareness of what they know, how they think, and act in the world through in-depth self-inquiry for Personal Transformation.• Community Shifts in Awareness: guides individual student Transformation to develop their understanding of the strengths and challenges within themselves and others to create a supportive, workable and sustainable learning community and school structure. • Connectedness/ Community: builds partnership with peers as fellow students and adults as educators who are also students of the larger academic community, through reciprocal teaching and learning.• Knowledge Constructivism: provides new opportunities for students from diverse and traditionally low performing backgrounds to contribute legitimate counter story and prior knowledge to supportive learning environment. Ethos Academy educational vision is rooted in constructivist learning theory, informed by neuroscience research, and pedagogical best practices. Instruction at Ethos Academy is based on a dynamic inquiry-based approach to teaching and learning. Ethos stand is that Constructivist Learning and Teaching as an academic social construct develops strong student learning identity rooted in Transformative Research Design (Mertens, 2009): • Underlying assumptions that rely on ethical stances of inclusion and challenge oppressive social structures. • An entry process into the community that is designed to build trust and make goals and strategies transparent. • Dissemination of findings in ways that encourage use of the results to enhance social justice and human rights.

As a new and progressive Charter with OaklandUnified, Ethos Academy academics and community are aligned with the five SELcompetencies. Social Emotional Learning (SEL) is a process through which children and adults develop the fundamental skills for life effectiveness. These are the skills we all need to handle ourselves, our relationships and our work effectively andethically.  These competencies will to be taught and developed in our students and modeled by adults in classrooms, school and throughout our system. Social Emotional Learning is not separate from academic learning but, in fact, is critical to the transition to and effectiveness of developing the conditions to engaging instructional practices needed to teach academic content through the Common Core State Standards.  The Five Social Emotional Learning Competencies:Self Awareness (labeling one’s feelings; relating feelings and thoughts to behavior; accurate self-assessment of strengths/limitations; self-efficacy; optimism) Self-Management (regulating one’s emotions; managing stress; self-control; self-motivation; setting and achieving goals)  Social Awareness (perspective-taking; empathy; understanding the socio-historicalcontext of diversity; understanding social and ethical norms for behavior; recognizing family, school and community supports) Relationship Skills (building relationships with diverse individuals/groups; communicating clearly; working cooperatively; resolving conflicts; seeking help) Responsible Decision Making (considering the well-being of self and others;basing decisions on safety, social and ethical considerations; making constructive, safe choices about self, relationships and school).FOUNDERS BIOS ALPHATIZED::Dr.Gilberto Ariaza graduated from the University of California at Berkeley, Social and Cultural Studies at the College of Education.

<p>Lama means ‘WHY’ in Hebrew. My name is Hila Ben Gera, I founded Lama Theater Company in 2014 with a goal to create theater
that constantly raises questions and encourages new and bold writing/directing
from within the nation and around
the world.  We are a nonprofit company, located at The Kraine Theater,
NYC.<span>  Our purpose is to create work that
is socio-culturally impactful. W</span>e give <span>interdisciplinary artists a
platform to create risk taking and thought provoking theater that will
inspire the audience to question the world around them and by that to create a
community that enlivens our existence.</span>

<p>I had the privilege to volunteer at
The Peace Project in Nicaragua in March 2015. I was teaching English through theater to local
children. It was one of the most exciting experiences of my life. I realized
how magical art can be to children in their process of learning.</p>

<h3>A small farm can be started (and sustained) in just one weekend</h3>
<div>We recently started a mushroom farm for a couple of amazing glassblowing artists. They knew nothing about mushroom cultivation before we taught them.</div>
<p>                                     <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455208180/lhdwc1zoeqrr72qv53fh.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 334.667px;height: 251px;""/></p>
<p>We taught and trained them in simple oyster mushroom inoculation...</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                                    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455208312/cq7hqerrispgi779iswu.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 334.667px;height: 251px;""/></p>
<p>Sterilization and sanitary spawn expansion...</p>

In just that weekend however, they were able to learn (and do!) everything required to sustain their tiny mushroom farm. They have since harvested and eaten the mushrooms, created their own spawn and inoculated their own blocks. They are now considering expanding to a full scale farm (because their guest room is often occupied). They know everything they need to run and sustain their own large farm now. We chat with them every week or so and they are still learning the intricacies and mastering the craft. <p>You can get your own small scale farm weekend workshop by contributing to this campaign now at the ""Tiny Farm Workshop Weekend"" contribution level.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Contamination is the biggest hindrance to any mushroom grower. We teach methods and procedures that reduce the risk of contamination. Attention to detail is what separates a great mushroom cultivator from average one. For amateur level cultivars we suggest beginning with oyster mushrooms and working up from there. </p>
<p>Group Growing advocates using extremely low tech methods anyone can replicate at home. It's about feeding all of our families. Everyone cannot afford expensive sterile laboratories as you see some Group Growing members in below.</p>

<h3>Building Community leads to Economic Empowerment</h3>
<p><span style=""margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;"">The farm used to be a central part of the community; it fed its members. Now we use money at grocery stores to buy food, we simply hope was grown with care. In actuality those fruits and veggies burned a lot of fuel traveling the globe to arrive at your local store, But don't worry, all the nasty chemical bybroducts from refining that fuel is sprayed on those veggies as pesticides and herbicides. It's a win-win, lol, or is it kill-kill? Anyway, we don't go near that stuff, we are Group Growing. We use only organic and natural processes to grow mushrooms. We teach our farms to do the same. </span></p>
<h3>What will we do with the money?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Buy our farms much needed infrastructure</li>
<li>Build a Mobile Mushroom Lab</li>
<li>Continue starting more farms</li>
<li>Continue sharing cultures, supplements and knowledge</li>
<li>Get help for our farmers</li>
<li>Host Free Fungi Feasts!</li>
</ul>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">Mushrooms for Bees?! What?! </span></h3>
<p>One of the cool things about Group Growing's network of farms is it enables us to research some cutting edge technologies.</p>
<p>Our Favorite long-term research and development projects include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Growing Biodynamic Mushrooms</li>
<li>Creating a mushroom mycelium Bee Hive</li>
<li>Assessing mycoremediation efforts</li>
<li>and growing new species of mushrooms!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p><span style=""margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;"">Group Growing is a grassroots movement creating self-sustaining mushroom production to benefit communities. We believe mushrooms can complete the nutritional profile alongside vegetable farms and/or community gardens.

Help us help each other to grow food to feed our communities. What we have been doing for the past few years is...

Teaching mushroom growing workshops. (For Free)
Sharing mushroom spawn (seed-stock). (For Free)
Sharing mushrooms and medicinal supplements. (For Free)
Sharing Fungal Cultures (For Free)
Starting and building mushroom farms for people and communities (For Free)
Sharing vegetable and flower seeds. (For Free)

 
            
We all have different experiences and skill sets. By teaching each other and working together we can attain results quicker and of a higher quality. Group Growing has helped thirteen communities build and establish Oyster and Lion's Mane cultivation facilities. These mushrooms will feed these communities as well as their larger local community.
 
                          

What We Need & What You Get
We need resources to build the infrastructure for growing mushroom farms.
We need the equipment and production supplies.
Please contribute now. You can receive the following rewards for you contribution...

Grow at home mushroom kits.
Workshops!
Grow at home videos.
A farm of your very own! Or a farm you can give to others!
T-shirts and wooden spinning mushroom tops.
Mushroom Chocolates.
Mushroom Culture Preservation explorer packs
Consultations
Sharondale Farm Teas


 

Think Global, Act Local
Group Growing teaches and advocates techniques that can work in any part of the world. Using local waste products as final substrates for growing mushrooms, we can provide top quality fungi for a fair price; eventually even FREE. We seek to put the production of spawn into the hands of local cultivators; creating closed loop sustainable practices.

 
                       
 
A small farm can be started (and sustained) in just one weekend
We recently started a mushroom farm for a couple of amazing glassblowing artists. They knew nothing about mushroom cultivation before we taught them.
                                     
We taught and trained them in simple oyster mushroom inoculation...
 
                                    
Sterilization and sanitary spawn expansion...
                                   
And then we played games... (next to a mini-greenhouse full of inoculated Lion's Mane, Reishi, and Oyster mushroom blocks.)
 
                                 It did take a few weeks before to prepare all the spawn to have ready for the weekend. In just that weekend however, they were able to learn (and do!) everything required to sustain their tiny mushroom farm. They have since harvested and eaten the mushrooms, created their own spawn and inoculated their own blocks. They are now considering expanding to a full scale farm (because their guest room is often occupied). They know everything they need to run and sustain their own large farm now. We chat with them every week or so and they are still learning the intricacies and mastering the craft. You can get your own small scale farm weekend workshop by contributing to this campaign now at the ""Tiny Farm Workshop Weekend"" contribution level.
Risks & Challenges
Contamination is the biggest hindrance to any mushroom grower. We teach methods and procedures that reduce the risk of contamination. Attention to detail is what separates a great mushroom cultivator from average one. For amateur level cultivars we suggest beginning with oyster mushrooms and working up from there. 
Group Growing advocates using extremely low tech methods anyone can replicate at home. It's about feeding all of our families. Everyone cannot afford expensive sterile laboratories as you see some Group Growing members in below.
 
                         

Building Community leads to Economic Empowerment
The farm used to be a central part of the community; it fed its members. Now we use money at grocery stores to buy food, we simply hope was grown with care. In actuality those fruits and veggies burned a lot of fuel traveling the globe to arrive at your local store, But don't worry, all the nasty chemical bybroducts from refining that fuel is sprayed on those veggies as pesticides and herbicides. It's a win-win, lol, or is it kill-kill? Anyway, we don't go near that stuff, we are Group Growing. We use only organic and natural processes to grow mushrooms. We teach our farms to do the same. 
What will we do with the money?

Buy our farms much needed infrastructure
Build a Mobile Mushroom Lab
Continue starting more farms
Continue sharing cultures, supplements and knowledge
Get help for our farmers
Host Free Fungi Feasts!

Mushrooms for Bees?! What?! 
One of the cool things about Group Growing's network of farms is it enables us to research some cutting edge technologies.
Our Favorite long-term research and development projects include:

Growing Biodynamic Mushrooms
Creating a mushroom mycelium Bee Hive
Assessing mycoremediation efforts
and growing new species of mushrooms!

Other Ways You Can Help
Group Growing is a grassroots movement creating self-sustaining mushroom production to benefit communities. We believe mushrooms can complete the nutritional profile alongside vegetable farms and/or community gardens. We seek to divert waste streams into our processes as oyster mushrooms will eat virtually any ligno-cellulosic material. The end results are healthy, protein rich mushrooms and amazing soil ammendments that helps increase moisture retention; assisting any farm against drought. We are also planning to use extra spent substrate logs as bio-remediation buffers. Two of our more cutting edge research projects include mycelial bee hives as well as biodynamic mushrooms. Our network is being set up to run decentralized experiments for the benefit of humanity.

<p><b><u>Short Summary</u></b></p>
<p> We are a group of Arab-American students
in Chicago who are trying to make the most out of an opportunity to teach
English overseas. Last year some of us had the opportunity to go down to Gaziantep
to teach in a summer school for Syrian students. Many refugees in Gaziantep have been deprived of an education for several years. Within days, 200 Syrian students of all ages had enrolled in our course, free of charge. This is a testament to the great need for educational opportunities amongst the Syrian refugee population. </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Inspired by these experiences, we have come together to set
up a program to help displaced Syrian students find academic opportunities by acquiring proficiency in English. By taking and passing the TOEFL exam, students can become eligible to apply to higher educational institutions and employment, thereby improving their station in life. The TOEFL exam can be a venue for social mobility for those that can afford it. For this reason, we've made it our mission to provide a TOEFL scholarship for 50 Syrian refugees. The TOEFL scholarship would include the fees for the TOEFL prep course, the TOEFL exam, and student expenses. Through these scholarships, we hope to empower Syrian refugees by allowing them to take charge of their lives and careers once more. </b></span></p>
<p><b><u>What We Need &amp; What You Get</u></b></p>
<p>Our mission is to raise money for a TOEFL scholarship fund so
these displaced Syrian students can continue their education in Turkey. We have
partnered with Zirve University to admit displaced students into a program that
will cover the costs of their TOEFL exam and a 10 week prep course taught at
Zirve by their bilingual instructors. Zirve has given us a discounted rate at
$700 per student which includes student expenses and TOEFL test fees. Our goal is to award 50 scholarships at a total cost of
$35,000.</p>
<p>We are optimistic that we can reach our goal of 50
scholarships but we will try to get as many as we possibly can. All donations
go through AALIF, a 501(c)(3) certified organization whose donations are
tax-deductible, before being used to pay Zirve University. Every $700 we get
goes directly to reserving a seat for a displaced student at Zirve University.
Because we are paying to cover the costs of the program, there is no upper
limit to how many scholarships we can award. If we send one student or one
hundred, we are still going to keep collecting.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal of 50 students we will award
whatever scholarships we can. None of the funds raised ever go to any administrative
or operational costs unrelated to the TOEFL classes. Money is deposited to
Zirve University in increments of $700 to reserve individual seats. The seats
we reserve remain saved for us until we have enough students to offer another
course.</p>
<p><b><u>The Impact</u></b></p>
<p>Most of us are so affected by images of Syrians fighting for
their mere survival that we forget that there are many different struggles the
Syrian people face. Many of them are students who have left their families and
have no idea what they are going to do next in life. That is a sentiment that I
feel many of us can relate to.</p>
<p>We often worry about the fate of young Syrians in these dark
times. By offering them alternatives to their current circumstances through
education we are aiding them against the tide of uncertainty that pushes these
students into the cycle of despondency. </p>
<p>It may not seem like much but many of us have spent months
studying for a single exam that we think will determine our future. We have
already awarded five scholarships to our former summer school students and they
have successfully completed their prep course and taken their TOEFL exams. They
are now working with educational institutions in America to try to get accepted
into academic programs in the US. A single exam can make all the difference.</p>
<p><b><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></b></p>
<p>Working to help displaced Syrians both within Syria and outside
of it comes with the expected challenges of dealing with the results of a
devastating conflict. Many organizations working to offer services to these
Syrians must deal with various (and often opposing) authorities on both sides
of the border while working in the midst of severe poverty and an unstable
atmosphere. </p>
<p>Luckily for us, we already have good friends in Gaziantep
who are willing to help us out. Between our affiliations with a local
university and our contacts in the Syrian educational community we feel
confident in our ability to offer a safe and resourceful environment for our
students and teachers.</p>
<p>We have been working on these educational programs for over
a year now and have learned how to avoid the common pitfalls that come with international
aid work. </p>

<p>My name is Elise Rida ,i was born in Rwanda . After lost my family during genocide when i was 10 ,I did not have hope , no one can give me hope , future has not sense for me , but when I had opportunity to get scholarship to study. It gave me the energy to work hard for change, ; it represented the return of confidence and hope , </p>
<p>Twenty years after the genocide were for me twenty years of survival and reconstruction. ""<i>Around me are the widows, the orphans. The ground on which I walk has not dared him to drink the blood of the innocent. ""Elise said in his book</i></p>
<p> I obtained my bachelor's degree in Sociology in 2011, I also had the opportunity to do a training course of leadership Development the ""Peace Through Business Program"" in Texas, the USA. I have a shop of Handcrafts in Kigali/Rwanda .<span>In 2014 ,i published my Book called ""Le Livre d' Elise ,les Belles Lettres ,Paris,2014</span></p>
<p>I became who I am because of support of others, so it is my time to give my help to others, there more orphans and widows who have not had the chance like me I believe that it is time to give back to the society but i need your support .</p>
<p><i>“We never knew adolescence; we became the forced parents of our little brothers and Sisters but also of ourselves.”  Elise said in his book ,Le livre d'Elise</i></p>
<p>This situation become both teenagers and parents, most of them have not had the opportunity to follow their studies and have the education, that is why training in sewing for widows and orphans and weaving for older women who can not learn sewing .</p>
<p>we started our activities there is already one month with 15 widows/orphans for the sewing and 6 of the oldest widows for weaving of the traditional baskets , </p>
<p>The beautiful Rwandan handcrafted baskets have been a part of the Rwanda culture ,<span>These baskets are made from natural raw materials that all can be found growing in Rwanda – sisal fibers, sweet grass, banana leaves and raffia.</span></p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
</div><p>We need to raise $ 6200 USD to continue our activities and to make our dream a reality .</p><p>Your funding will help us:</p><ul>

Now I’m calling you to send a hope and making a small difference in the life of others, we’re not asking for University degree but for Skills Training in the sewing and Handicrafts production industry and for basic training in entrepreneurship.
 “The Survivors are not heroes because they escaped from death but rather because they can support the pain, and live with all of the consequences of Genocide”  “Le Livre d’Elise” E. Rida
 http://www.lesbelleslettres.com/livre/?GCOI=22510100614430&fa=description
My name is Elise Rida ,i was born in Rwanda . After lost my family during genocide when i was 10 ,I did not have hope , no one can give me hope , future has not sense for me , but when I had opportunity to get scholarship to study. It gave me the energy to work hard for change, ; it represented the return of confidence and hope , 
Twenty years after the genocide were for me twenty years of survival and reconstruction. ""Around me are the widows, the orphans. The ground on which I walk has not dared him to drink the blood of the innocent. ""Elise said in his book
 I obtained my bachelor's degree in Sociology in 2011, I also had the opportunity to do a training course of leadership Development the ""Peace Through Business Program"" in Texas, the USA. I have a shop of Handcrafts in Kigali/Rwanda .In 2014 ,i published my Book called ""Le Livre d' Elise ,les Belles Lettres ,Paris,2014
I became who I am because of support of others, so it is my time to give my help to others, there more orphans and widows who have not had the chance like me I believe that it is time to give back to the society but i need your support .
“We never knew adolescence; we became the forced parents of our little brothers and Sisters but also of ourselves.”  Elise said in his book ,Le livre d'Elise
This situation become both teenagers and parents, most of them have not had the opportunity to follow their studies and have the education, that is why training in sewing for widows and orphans and weaving for older women who can not learn sewing .
we started our activities there is already one month with 15 widows/orphans for the sewing and 6 of the oldest widows for weaving of the traditional baskets , 
The beautiful Rwandan handcrafted baskets have been a part of the Rwanda culture ,These baskets are made from natural raw materials that all can be found growing in Rwanda – sisal fibers, sweet grass, banana leaves and raffia.
What We Need & What You Get
We need to raise $ 6200 USD to continue our activities and to make our dream a reality .Your funding will help us:

- The purchase of sewing machines
- The purchase of fabric of learning and of material

Every dollar is important because it represents a return to the hope for these young people and these  women. The more our project collects funds, the more we can help them

serving mostly low-income families in and around Albany, NY. Harriet 
Tubman enrolls many students
who were drop-outs or considered at-risk, and offers a safe and diverse 
community for all youth. We
receive no public funds and over half of our students
 have always received scholarships.

 of our
student families cannot contribute. We strive to  create a learning environment that meets every child’s needs, and<i> your support will help make that possible</i>.</p>
<p>While large donations are helpful, a great number of small donations will also get us to our goal — every bit helps!</p>

 students coming to us from
low-income families, our revenue balance has shifted dramatically away 
from
tuition-paying students. We require support from individuals in the 
wider community if the school is to continue to serve this population by
helping them graduate high school. <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1078504/files/20141207143625-IMG_2930_-_Revised.JPG?1417991785"" src="""" style=""width: 394.767px; height: 140px;""/></p>Nationwide, people are realizing that there are many children who simply
 cannot learn in traditional schools. This is particularly true for 
students from low-income families who cannot afford to pay for the 
individual extra help of a tutor or small classrooms in a private 
school. The drop-out rate is alarmingly high, especially for low-income 
students of color. Equal access to all educational opportunities is 
beneficial to our entire community, as it allows our youth to support 
themselves through better employment and encourages them to make other 
positive life choices.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1078743/files/20141207170655-Stage.JPG?1418000815"" src="""" style=""width: 243.67px; height: 188px;""/>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1078747/files/20141207170724-Turbine.jpg?1418000844"" src="""" style=""width: 140.25px; height: 187px;""/><br/><br/>Our experience tells us that many children need small, community-based
