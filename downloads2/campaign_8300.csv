<p>How is it possible that this miscreant Monkey is revered in China and throughout Asia and yet almost completely unknown in America?  With this new translation I hope to change that by making Monkey King's story truly accessible to a western audience.</p>
<p>As Scott Black has written in the book's introduction:  ""When we engage
Monkey’s story—when we take our turn with it—we too are again born, enlivened, and
shaped by his extraordinary adventures, his comic cheekiness, and his cosmic
rebellion. Monkey, that is, lives again in—or <i>as</i>—our monkey minds. We give life to him as he gives delightfully
heightened form to our cravings and fantasies."" </p>
<p>This project represents the culmination of a journey that began for me more than 30 years ago when I first came across a copy of Monkey's adventures in a bookstore in Taiwan.  Ever since then Monkey King has been working his magic on my mind.  Ten years ago I started on the path of learning to read Chinese so I could eventually tackle my own translation of the book.  Now with this Indiegogo campaign I am finally on the verge of bringing the vision to fruition.   </p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>To complete preparation and publication of our first edition, we need to raise enough funds to cover the costs of the illustrations, layout &amp; design and printing:</p> <ul> <li>We're offering first edition copies of the book for $35.  This first edition will not be available or sold through any channel other than our Indiegogo campaign.  </li>
<li>The book is beautifully illustrated by the Brazilian artist Marcelo Zissu and each copy will be signed by me.</li>
<li>We need to pre-sell a minimum of 75 copies in order to cover our costs and reach our minimum campaign goal of $2,250.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>As the translator of this book, not the author, I have no compunction in telling you that it really is utterly unique and one of the greatest books of all time.  If you are at all drawn to Daoism and Buddhism it is essential reading.  And even if you're not yet interested in Eastern spirituality then this is great way to discover what you're missing.</p>
<p>I am a writer, poet and translator.  This will be my third published book.  My last book was published through a successful campaign on Kickstarter, which sold several hundred copies and raised more than $5000; it was a poem which told the true life story of a 90 year old homeless man who lived on the streets of New York City.   </p>
<p>The first chapter of the Monkey King translation was previously published online by Brooklyn Rail and you can read it here to get a better idea of the style of my new translation:   <a href=""http://intranslation.brooklynrail.org/chinese/the-adventures-of-monkey-king"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://intranslation.brooklynrail.org/chinese/the-adventures-of-monkey-king</a>   </p>

I am a Metis
Artist born and raised in Fort St James BC, in Carrier Territory-Northern BC
(Canada) and I am currently living & raising my family (6 children) on a
farm on Vancouver Island. 

Growing up in
an isolated Northern Village, my mixed heritage was a unique blessing and a strange
curse…  I witnessed violence occurring in
ALL cultures; particularly against women and their children.  I also witnessed Love in ALL cultures, strong
and virtuous family connections and most of all, a long-term kind of love that
our community had for each other. 
I became an
active member of our Fireweed Women’s Society when I had children of my own. I
dreamed of one day owning and teaching at a womens co-housing facility, and I
pursued a BA degree in First Nations Studies, and a minor in Visual Art from
Vancouver Island University.
Not long after
my graduation my family went into crisis mode. I was left with no options and
almost overnight I had become a client at a Womens Safe House, rather than
managing one…I was devastated.

 I began an epic Art journey into healing my own heart and mind. Along the way, I met many who were doing the same. I started to study and work with Shiloh Sophia McCloud & the Cosmic Cowgirls Artist Network, and I have been teaching and assisting many others with their own healing work, in person and in workshops.
TODAY I PAINT. I paint in studio, and I paint live for large audiences. My intent is to trigger feelings of self-compassion in the viewer… To help my audience see themselves for the beautiful and loving people that they are, and always were. If I’ve done well, it works like medicine for the Soul.I ALSO TEACH. It has been my humble honour to put a brush and a set of skills into the hands of beginner women & girl artists.

The Impact
We will paint 7hrs a day, 6 days per week. To me, this is heaven, but it's also essential to the development of my own work.

Learning from these master painters is going to develop my Art, and the Art of those whom I teach.

Several of my returning painting students are ready for me to begin offering advanced painting skills; and i see this trip as a mission to retrieve those skills.
Investments in an artist development become  visible in each progressive painting.

</div></div>","Greetings and IntroductionMy name is Dallas.  I began going to Burning Man in 2007 having no idea what it was nor knowing anyone who had ever been except one person, Philip Longfellow.  This friend told me it would change my life, and it did, as a result of his insistence that I come to this thing in the desert.  I've learned a new way of being in the world by applying the promulgated Ten Principles and by camping and collaborating with other creative hearts and minds in Black Rock City and beyond.  You all continue to inspire, encourage and support the individual and collective self expressions of our vast and wide community.  This project, and my first foray into facilitating an participatory art experience, happened solely because of Burning Man and specifically due to support from the Regional Network.I give you Gratitude!  How did this start?The New York City burner founded FIGMENT was the impetus for this project with their ""What will you bring?"" call for art and participation.  Their radically inclusive ask opened me to creating an interactive experience with the use of mirrors and written affirmations , which I called the 'AffirMirroR'.  I used all found objects including two large plexiglass mirrors, framing wood, adornments and fabric retrieved from the streets and dumpsters of Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan. (photo of the AffirMirroR by Eraj Asadi)What is a 'Reflectahedron'?In spring 2014, the Las Vegas Burning Man regional gathering, The Forgotten City, put out a their call for art.  I responded with a concept for a new version of the ""AffirMirroR"" that would be made from highly polished reflective stainless steel in the form of a tetrahedron.  This mirrored pyramid, nicknamed the 'myrrormid', is a reflective polyhedron, which I dub, a reflectahedron.  A reflectahedron is a mirrored stainless steel polyhedron designed as a transformative tool for reflection, perspective and illumination. Participants interact by writing affirmations, positive statements, dreams, wishes, compassionate commands, states of being, or other self expressions.This first reflectahedron, a regular (equilateral) tetrahedron, is the first of the Platonic Solids. The long term vision of this project is to build reflectahedrons of all the platonic solids.  From Wikipedia:  [Many] ""have studied the mathematical beauty and symmetry of the Platonic solids for thousands of years. They are named for the ancient Greek philosopherPlato who theorized in his dialogue, the Timaeus, that the classical elements were made of these regular solids.[1]""
After bringing the reflectahedron to Las Vegas thanks to a grant from The Forgotten City, it has appeared at FIGMENT San Diego and various burner events and public beach parks in the Los Angeles area.  Everyone who interacts with the reflectahedron seems to have a very positive experience.
Why Am I Doing This?I feel that sharing concepts of positive thinking, affirmations, the power of pyramids and sacred geometry along with mirrors and reflectivity can help enable self empowerment and shift the collective consciousness in the direction of truth, beauty, compassion and Love.   Plus, it's a beautiful object and quite visually compelling.   I really enjoy setting it up and seeing how people interact.What's Next?I want to bring this to more people and places.  How?  On wheels!   The next phase of this project is building a personal art transport device by attaching it to a motorized wheelchair base.    This will allow an individual Reflectahedron sculpture, along with a docent rider, to be easily transported to more places and participants at Burning man or other festival, event or public space.  If more than the goal is raised I'd like to make additional ""myrrormids"", because more triangular face pieces will allow me to either configure a larger scale version, or reconfigure the panels to create an octahedron or dodecahedron.  The larger scale would require building two more of the current sized model, then constructing a steel frame rigging method to combine all of the panels into one larger sculpture, with an opening indicated be the red lines. allowing people to get inside for shade or more writing (it is mirrored inside as well, although not as highly polished).This configuration allows me to setup individual myrrormid reflectahedrons in separate locations.  Then, later they can be combined together to be installed into a larger reflective ""effigy"" object, that would be read and perhaps wiped clean in a ""burn"" like activity.  What's Needed?For the mobile art transport system:- One used motorized wheelchair and and materials for the base (~ $750)For each additional myrrormid reflectahedron:- 1 sheet of #8 polished stainless steel cut and bent to design spec (~$600)BONUS: Trailer / Ramp for transporting the wheelchair with my van. (~ $500)If the goal is not met, collected funds will be used to support the current Reflectahedron art’s presentation, in way of markers, windex, a buffer and compound to polish the steel, and fuel to transport the Reflection to events.  How can you help and what will you get?* Please share this campaign link on you social networks  https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/reflectahedron* Follow the instagram http://instagram.com/reflectahedron* Friend the Facebook http://instagram.com/reflectahedronart* Donate materials (do you happen to have a spare wheelchair?)For perks,  besides what I can personally offer, I am also reaching out to others who have tetrahedron or platonic solid related art to ask them if they'd like to participate.   I have found some folks already that are excited to be involved.  Keep an eye on updates for new perks as I make contact with more artists.Here's the first  featured guest perk from Etsy user RawElementsJewelryAnd a sample image of the T-ShirtNOTE:  MORE PERKS TO COME (please check back often to see what's new and/or suggest something)

Also, you don't have to give anything to have an experience with the Reflectahedron.  It's already going to be at Burning Man 2014, and if possible, will be mobile this year (provided I can obtain funds in advance of your contributions to make it happen before I arrive).  
Come find me at The Sunset Trip village at 8:00 & Esplanade in the Dirty Beetles camp and let's play with the reflectahedron.   Thank you so much!

My name is Meg Harris and I am a dreamer, a
baker, and a puppeteer who manifests dreams into reality. I find
inspiration in the oddities of life; the dead of night, the moment between

unseen, and the untapped human curiosity. Giving life to inanimate objects is

objective stays the same.</div><div> I have been working on some version of Puppets and

artist/baker with a midwestern work ethic who is well connected and
resourceful. </div><div>This campaign is to make Puppets and Pastries into a mobile space that can travel, containing a certified kitchen, and also a pop up puppet stage.</div><div></div>
I am creating a multi-sensory experience that
blurs the line between strange and irresistible. The baked goods will be made
from scratch using only local, organic ingredients, and will be
shaped/decorated as creatures, each with a story of their own. Puppet shows,
workshops, music and a sensory environment will accompany the pastries, making
an experience both playful and efficient. I am researching similar models of
bakeries and spaces with eclectic or bizarre themes and noting how
entertainment is involved and utilized.  I
expect a wide range of interest in this multi-faceted business model that I am
forming. <div>

These donations will purchase not only the vehicle, the equipment updates inside, but also supplies to create a pop up puppet stage outside attached to the side of the vehicle. Also some technical things such as business/food cart lisenses and certification fees so it can be a legit business in Oregon.  Not only this, but if funding is ample, hand cast cake molds, cake boxes and baking supplies will be needed. </p>
<p>If funding doesn't reach this goal, I still appreciate any help i can get. I will purchase the vehicle and fix it up at the very least. I have applied for various grants to cover some costs also, for puppet workshop supplies, puppet show creation materials and also marketing materials. My goal is to get Puppets and Pastries mobile up and running for summer/fall of 2017.</p>
<p>You will also receive fun hand made gifts when you contribute- some of which will be sent out in time for the winter holidays.

contain a sense of wonder and curiosity about the world and who enjoy the

<div>
Puppets and Pastries is not solely a for profit

Our
Experience:  We have years of experience
in large-scale installation art for special events, museum openings, and are
well-known internationally in the floral design community for our
larger-than-life work and dynamic stage presentations. Our work is a unique
combination of sculpture, floral design, and architectural design.View time lapse videos of our Large Scale Floral Art installations at the de Young Museum:  Flornado and Elemental.    Moving
Forward: Our ambition is to design permanent sculptures for public spaces and
architectural environments.  For the first time, we are taking on an outdoor public art project, and are excited to share our vision with the city.
The
Proposal:  An art-minded building owner
has offered us the opportunity to design and install a temporary piece on a
prominent building façade in the Hayes Valley neighborhood of San
Francisco.  Below is a photo of the building with a previous piece, ""The Flag Building""

<h3>About Public Transformation</h3>
<p>The 2016 presidential election revealed major rifts in our country - most notably, a profound disconnect between urban and rural areas. It revealed that we are not talking to each other openly enough, that we don’t understand each other deeply enough, and that many assumptions are being made on all sides of the conversation.</p>
<p>Theater and social practice artist Ashley Hanson, whose large-scale public performances put rural life at their center, was curious how other artists working in rural areas were contemplating these geographic divides. As an artist who works in both rural and urban areas, she set out to investigate what her responsibility is in this conversation: ""How can I do my work better? How can it dig deeper to better connect individuals and communities across these great divides? I decided to do what I know best: ask questions, listen deeply to the answers, and to share what I learn in a way that helps us all connect, and move forward, together.""</p>
<p>So, she bought a little yellow school bus and set off on a 6,200 mile high-paced fact-finding mission, visiting 127 artists in 24 communities with populations of under 10,000. For six-weeks, the little yellow school bus (""Gus"") acted as a cross-country mobile artist residency, with a rotating cast of Mobile Artists-in-Residence documenting the work of rural-based creatives, cultural leaders, and arts organizations, as they make their place in American culture.</p>

<p>The Department of Public Transformation left from San Francisco on January 4, 2017, visiting artists living in communities with population under 10,000 from coast-to-coast, participating in the Women's March on Washington on January 21, 2017, heading back through Minnesota, and ending in Colorado on February 6, 2017. The stories collected on this journey were shared at The Rural Arts &amp; Culture Summit on June 6-8, 2017 in Morris, MN, and at an initial gallery exhibition at The Outpost collaborative space in Winona, MN in October / November 2017. We continue to share these stories (and incorporate new ones) across the country through artist talks, gallery exhibitions, conference presentations, and good ol' fashioned conversations.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Help the Department of Public Transformation Continue the Journey...</h3>
<p>After the initial 6-week Research Road Trip, it became clear that the Department of Public Transformation journey was far from over. The Department continues to expand and adapt to find new ways to tell stories, share knowledge and understanding, and connect artists all over the country. What started as a road trip has turned into an ongoing artist inquiry and rich national network of rural makers, movers, and shakers. America is big, and we are so excited to see what the future holds.</p>

<h3>About Annie Terrazzo</h3>
<p>I have been an artist living in Los Angeles for 17 years. In that time I have sold countless works, been in some fantastic shows, and had many great opportunities. My work has evolved as I have as a person and I have achieved more than I ever set out to do. Having said that, I have been disappointed with the regular art system and have always been more attracted to doing things myself. When The Other Art Fair contacted me and asked me to participate in their first Los Angeles exhibition, I thought it would be a great opportunity for me to not only represent myself and my work but also strive to create a body of work that challenged me.</p>
<p>So Why The Other Art Fair? </p>
<p>The Other Art Fair is the leading artist fair for art lovers to meet and buy direct from the very best emerging and undiscovered artists.</p>
<p>With fairs across the globe in the UK and Australia, each edition of The Other Art Fair showcases work by a selection of talented artists handpicked by a committee of art industry experts.</p>
<p>Celebrated for its unique visitor experience, The Other Art Fair inspires and delights with a tightly curated and distinctive programme of immersive fair features that create a platform for the ‘unexpected’ at each fair.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Achieving My Goal</h3>
<p>Achieving this goal is not done on the cheap. I need new materials and time to mess up and fail. I need to cover the booth costs and professional set up/tear down. Without your help, there would be no way for me to fund this dream. </p>
<p>For every $50 donation, I will provide a set of 4 postcards featuring work from my new show.</p>
<p>For every $100 donation, I will provide a signed and numbered hand embellished 11 x 14 print (5 artworks to choose from)</p>
<p>For every $500 donation, you can pick an artwork from my collection to have permanently.</p>
<p>For every $700 donation, I will create a custom artwork of your choice. Want your family drawn? Your dog? Or something you've always wanted? Nows the time!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It's not easy going in a different direction. It takes guts and patience and drive. After 17 years of being an artist, I feel itis time for me to say something new with my work. The world has changed and so have I. Your donation will help me build up the foundation for this new body of work and get me focused on the next stage of my artistic career and a place to show it off!</p>

<p>Three years ago, I decided to fund Chibinendo Art. A transformative service to break the barrier to entry in the professional grade of customized products.

<p>A chance to experiment the creativity, quality, and the efficiency of Chibinendo Art with a <strong>huge discount</strong>. All the <i><strong>rewards</strong></i> are created so you can choose between all the different products that you can currently purchase in my shop but with at least a <strong>35%</strong> discount, and <strong>free shipping</strong> <i>(or just £2 if outside EU)</i>. I'm specialized in merchandising and fantasy themes, but don't get confused, the images of the rewards are just a glimpse of what you can pre-order ;) As <strong>you choose the subject and theme</strong>, anything can be possible! If you don't have any subject in mind, tell me something that you like and I will improvise for you! <i>Example: if you like dogs, but you are undecided which one, you can just specify at the subject ""dogs""</i>.</p>
<p><i>When will you choose the subject </i>or <i>theme?</i> After you choose your reward and checkout, you will receive an email confirmation from IndieGoGo and a personal one from me/Chibinendo Art. You will be able to answer to this email specifying the subject-character, story, movie... <i>You don't need to rush!</i> You can give it as many thoughts as you want until the campaign finishes. But the sooner you decide, the sooner I will start creating for you!</p>

</div></div>","Three years ago, I decided to fund Chibinendo Art. A transformative service to break the barrier to entry in the professional grade of customized products. After two years of training my abilities and a year of trial, I believe that people would love the idea of having customised sculptures, but they might think that are out of their league or where to look for.

With this campaign, I want to affirm Chibinendo Art and its commissioning, designing, and creative services. Moreover, this campaign will offer Chibinendo Art stability and opportunities to grow and offer better customer experience.
 
Most of the funds will go to cover the costs of materials. Some of them are:


Different types of clay

Paints
Brushes
Varnishes

I will also purchase new tools that will help me improve the quality of the sculptures and the making process faster:

Clay extruder
A small turntable
Magnifying glasses

The rest will go to cover the costs of shipping and production of this campaign. 

A chance to experiment the creativity, quality, and the efficiency of Chibinendo Art with a huge discount. All the rewards are created so you can choose between all the different products that you can currently purchase in my shop but with at least a 35% discount, and free shipping (or just £2 if outside EU). I'm specialized in merchandising and fantasy themes, but don't get confused, the images of the rewards are just a glimpse of what you can pre-order ;) As you choose the subject and theme, anything can be possible! If you don't have any subject in mind, tell me something that you like and I will improvise for you! Example: if you like dogs, but you are undecided which one, you can just specify at the subject ""dogs"".
When will you choose the subject or theme? After you choose your reward and checkout, you will receive an email confirmation from IndieGoGo and a personal one from me/Chibinendo Art. You will be able to answer to this email specifying the subject-character, story, movie... You don't need to rush! You can give it as many thoughts as you want until the campaign finishes. But the sooner you decide, the sooner I will start creating for you!


Crowdfunding is not about just giving money, you are making my dream of working in the sculpture world real. Furthermore, by letting me create your unique sculpture, you also highlight the value of distinctive art over mass-production.
 
 
I put a lot of dedication and hard-work in every creation, thus delivering all the rewards on time can be challenging. But some more time and patience will be worth your perfect sculpture.

We present the works of moving image, sound, digital and performance artists - from the emerging to pioneers of their art forms - through exhibitions and weekly events.<br/></p>The main motivation for starting Microscope was to address what we consider as an unnecessary divide between the white box setting of the gallery and black box of the screening/performance venue. Microscope was conceived as a place where artists working with these time-based arts can show their works in one or the other or both contexts according to their artistic intent.<br/><br/>Microscope Gallery does essentially <b>two things at once</b>: we operate as a gallery with a <b>regular schedule of exhibitions</b> open five days a week, and alongside we feature a <b>weekly series of events</b>. To date, we have presented<b> 34 art exhibitions</b> and <b>more than 250 events</b> by artists working primarily with film, video, sound, digital art and performance in our current four-hundred-twenty square foot space.  <p><br/><br/></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/682675/files/20140629131134-LW-Micro-Medium.jpg?1404072694"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span style=""color: #888888;"">(From Liz Wendelbo's exhibition ""Opticks"" at the gallery, 2010)<br/></span></p><p></p><br/><p></p><p>Through both exhibitions and events, Microscope offers new and emerging artists the opportunity for larger bodies of their works to be seen.

Hollywood movies in book form – from which she has appropriated, among 
others, images of Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor starring in John 
Huston’s “The Maltese Falcon”. Freeing these references from the

To get from now to the moment where the lights go off on our first event, <b>we need your help!</b> This is the only way we can continue, and grow. <br/><br/> <br/><b>Sincere THANKS to all of you who have supported us thus far!

We present the works of moving image, sound, digital and performance artists - from the emerging to pioneers of their art forms - through exhibitions and weekly events.The main motivation for starting Microscope was to address what we consider as an unnecessary divide between the white box setting of the gallery and black box of the screening/performance venue. Microscope was conceived as a place where artists working with these time-based arts can show their works in one or the other or both contexts according to their artistic intent.Microscope Gallery does essentially two things at once: we operate as a gallery with a regular schedule of exhibitions open five days a week, and alongside we feature a weekly series of events. To date, we have presented 34 art exhibitions and more than 250 events by artists working primarily with film, video, sound, digital art and performance in our current four-hundred-twenty square foot space.  (From Liz Wendelbo's exhibition ""Opticks"" at the gallery, 2010)Through both exhibitions and events, Microscope offers new and emerging artists the opportunity for larger bodies of their works to be seen. We always welcome and consider submissions and offer several Open Call Events each year. Additionally, we strive to gain a wider audience for more established artists and to blur the boundaries between the so-called film-, sound- and performance- worlds – and the ""art world"".

It’s a place you go to learn and concentrate on what’s presented to you.” - Ken Jacobs (artist) in NYTimes“I’d never seen that side of her [Su Friedrich's] as an artist before. These things unrelated to filmmaking managed to illuminate her process as a filmmaker.” -- Sally Berger (curator, MoMA) in NY Times""I’m really excited by the fervent, steady stream of programming at Microscope gallery in Bushwick. They combine installations and events very nicely in that tiny space, doing a ton with a little. Their curating combines great classic NY avant-garde with new forms of experimentation in projection, music, and sound."" -- Rachael Rakes (Film Society of Lincoln Center) in ArtFCity""I... realized that many of the finest programmers and greatest connoisseurs of the history of cinema are absent from the poll [British Film Institute (BFI)], to which their knowledge could have brought a lot. I'm thinking of Michael Chaiken, Andrea Monti and Elle Burchill from the USA…"" -- Nicole Brenez (Cinémathèque Francaise, Paris)""They say a microscope is an optical instrument to view very small objects, well, as a space Microscope Gallery is a tiny place where great ideas grow larger. Microscope Gallery is great."" -- Amos Poe (artist)""Founded in 2010 in the Bushwick area of Brooklyn, Microscope Gallery has rapidly become one of the most interesting art venues in New York."" -- Enrico Camporesi (curator, research fellow at Centre Pompidou, Paris) in La Furia UmanaRead ""Seen Through The Microscope"" a recent interview with Enrico Camporesi for the international journal La Furia Umana(From ""Triple Blind"" exhibition, 2013, w/ works by Kenneth Curwood, Bradley Eros, Jeanne Liotta)WHY WE NEED SUPPORTWe have become very attached to our intimate space, as have many of you. But in order to continue to present the quality of events programming that Microscope aspires to it is time to expand in both size and scope.We are extremely pleased to share with you that we just signed a long-term lease on a great two-thousand square foot, semi-raw warehouse space.It is still in Bushwick, but more conveniently located, right off the Jefferson L train stop. The move will make it possible to present many types of Events that we were previously unable to do and to bring larger shows in-house, such as our ""now what"" moving image and performance series curated through an international Open Call. In order to move forward, we are asking for and will need your generous support.USE OF FUNDSBetween now and our planned opening this September, there is a lot of work to be done in order to house the Event Series.By contributing to our Indiegogo Campaign you will help us cover the costs of a quiet air conditioning/heating system, building and soundproofing walls, skylight covers as well as upgrading our equipment for a larger venue including a 12-foot screen, stronger speakers, longer-throw projectors, additional seating, and other essential costs.Your contributions will also help make it possible for us to run an expanded Event Series in which we will be extending our outreach, working with additional curators, increasing our film rental budget and involving others in the day-to-day operations such as promotion, web, archiving, and video documentation of the new series.Please note that a portion of your donations will be given to the artists who generously made available their works for the campaign, including Bradley Eros, Anton Perich, Sarah Halpern, Su Friedrich, Kevvy Metal, Julian Glander, Cave Days, Liz Wendelbo, Peggy Ahwesh, James Fotopoulos, Jack Smith, Takahiko Iimura, Marni Kotak, and Jonas Mekas.TAX-DEDUCTIBLEDonations to our Indiegogo Campaign are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law through our fiscal sponsor Fractured Atlas.REWARDSAMONG THE MANY GREAT REWARDS WE HAVE TO OFFER YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT ARE:Microscope Tote BagOur new Microscope Tote Bag, featuring a xerox collage by artist Bradley Eros.Special Video #1: ""Taylor Mead Skype Performance""Private link to the full 30-minute long Skype performance by New York legend Taylor Mead that took place at Microscope in occasion of his participation to the Berlin-based Festival Camp/Anti-Camp!

""Blackbird"" Booklet by Sarah HalpernSigned booklet by artist Sarah Halpern, 2013, 7 x 5.5"", pp. 19Halpern revisits classic Hollywood films through xeroxed collages and shadow plays made with cut-outs of images from film theory books and movie fan magazines. The booklet is inspired by the artist’s discovery of “The
 Film Classic Library” – a series of complete re-constructions of 
Hollywood movies in book form – from which she has appropriated, among 
others, images of Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor starring in John 
Huston’s “The Maltese Falcon”. Freeing these references from the 
confines of character and plot structure, Halpern creates a layered 
conversation concerning film iconography and male/female relationships.""Gently Down The Stream"" Booklet by Su FriedrichHandmade booklet by artist Su Friedrich, 1995, 3 x 9"", pp. 36A signed booklet made by Su Friedrich in 1995 using images and text from her great 1981 film ""Gently Down The Stream"".From the booklet:""I make a second / vagina / beside my first one / I look in surpriseWhich / is the original?"" About the film:""Gently Down the Stream can be described about as easily as you 
can hold on to a handful of water....Suffice it to say that Friedrich 
has an artist's instinctive sense of film—she expresses herself in it 
with a freedom and rightness that strike the viewer immediately. When 
the last image leaves the screen, you may not be able to say what you've
 seen, but you know what you've felt.""

It is a classic example of the 'apartment museums' that are popular throughout Russia but this one open only by invitation. It became the repository of the remains of Eisenstein's library and even if fragmentary, is a great indicator of his vast knowledge of literature and languages and his interest in high and low culture in addition to leaving a trace of the research he did for his film subjects and techniques.  The Ernest Fenollosa volume for example was an important reference for the development of the theory of montage. Naum and the others talked for hours and I spent that time studying the books.  The place had no electricity so by the end I was photographing individual volumes near the open window as the light faded.

One of

<h2><strong>White Dwarf Gallery!</strong></h2>
<h3>UAS is excited to present a new stream of programming! UAS White Dwarf Gallery is a new exhibition space which fosters stronger relationships between artists, arts organizations and the general public.</h3>
<p>Located adjacent to UAS Satellite Gallery, White Dwarf Gallery is a new stream of exhibition programming featuring community oriented exhibitions of a boundary pushing nature. </p>
<p><strong>We envision a free-form gallery space </strong>where communities can merge and collaborate, offering ground breaking ideas around community activism to the general public and showcasing the art of marginalized communities. Programming in this gallery follows a specific mandate of highlighting visual art that emphasizes community and collaboration. White Dwarf Gallery is not continually programmed and exhibitions vary in length. <br/><br/> White Dwarf exhibitions feature cross-programming initiatives with collectives, groups or organizations in the spirit of building community. Solo or duel exhibitions dealing with community, activism or social justice will also be considered. <br/><br/> At this point in time UAS does not have designated funds to program this space or offer artist fees. Artists or groups exhibiting in the White Dwarf Gallery can work with UAS to pursue alternate means of funding.</p>
<h3>We are really excited to already have TWO exhibitions programmed in this space!!</h3>
<p> </p>
<h2>Safe Lights:</h2>
<h3>Exhibition Runs: February 15 – March 9, 2013<br/> Opening Reception: Friday, February 15, 7–11pm</h3>
<p>Untitled Art Society is please to present Safe Lights in the White Dwarf Gallery. This exhibition features the work of many Calgary-based photographers who incorporate analogue developing and printing as a crucial aspect of their artistic practice. </p>
<p><br/> The level of research and technological knowledge required to create these images becomes a critical part of their conceptual framework. The act of printing in a darkroom and the relationships that each artist builds with his or her process is highly physical, time consuming and intimate. <br/><br/> The utilization of these highly traditional processes as a means of image making re-presents the art historical context of photography in a new and contemporary light. This exhibition can function as an artificial timeline. A wide range of technological eras is being presented, but contentiously marred and subverted with cues of the present day. <br/><br/> There is a continual binary tension created by these works. Past and present, precious and infinite, tangible and intangible all play into how darkroom photography functions as a contrast to digital photography as a contemporary form of art. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Brandon Dalmer: CRISIUM</h2>
<h3>Exhibition Runs: March 28 – June 22, 2013<br/>Opening Reception: Friday, May 24, 8–11pm</h3>
<p><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">CRISIUM will be a culmination of the construction of a small fictional spacecraft’s escape pod within the space. This project has a two phases that utilizes the space and installation. First being the actual construction of the craft, will be open to the public to observe as Dalmer constructs the dodecahedron. The second phase will be the exhibition itself, in which viewers are invited to peer inside (but never enter) the elaborate escape pod created by the artist.</span></p>
<p>Dalmer’s work using comic narrative to present symbolism and archetypes in a more accessible nature. This exhibition will also become a hub for communities to engage the educational elements of Dalmer’s work.</p>
<p>Throughout the process of installation viewers will be invited to enter, and interact with the artist as he creates his work and be exposed to the subtleties of the working process. Showcasing art in progress lends itself easily to advocacy for the arts. Viewers gain the opportunity to become far more engaged as they recognize and respect the commitment, skill, and knowledge involved in being an artist. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>Funding the Gallery</h2>
<h3>At this point in time, UAS does not have dedicated funds to program this gallery separately. Here’s where your contribution will go towards:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong> Artist fees for Brandon Dalmer (he’s flying in from Toronto to complete this project!!)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Artist fees for the artists of Safe Lights</strong></li>
<li><strong>Supplies to keep this gallery looking swell (paint, lights, etc)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Funds to printing and hospitality for the opening receptions.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Having a little extra funds will really help to make this gallery a consitant part of UAS’s programming! Right now our priority is funding the two current projects, but anything beyond the cost of gallery supplies and artist fees used for these two shows will go towards making this gallery a sustainable part of UAS and funding future exhibitions in the white dwarf gallery!!</p>

</div></div>","White Dwarf Gallery!
UAS is excited to present a new stream of programming! UAS White Dwarf Gallery is a new exhibition space which fosters stronger relationships between artists, arts organizations and the general public.
Located adjacent to UAS Satellite Gallery, White Dwarf Gallery is a new stream of exhibition programming featuring community oriented exhibitions of a boundary pushing nature. 
We envision a free-form gallery space where communities can merge and collaborate, offering ground breaking ideas around community activism to the general public and showcasing the art of marginalized communities. Programming in this gallery follows a specific mandate of highlighting visual art that emphasizes community and collaboration. White Dwarf Gallery is not continually programmed and exhibitions vary in length.  White Dwarf exhibitions feature cross-programming initiatives with collectives, groups or organizations in the spirit of building community. Solo or duel exhibitions dealing with community, activism or social justice will also be considered.  At this point in time UAS does not have designated funds to program this space or offer artist fees. Artists or groups exhibiting in the White Dwarf Gallery can work with UAS to pursue alternate means of funding.
We are really excited to already have TWO exhibitions programmed in this space!!
 
Safe Lights:
Exhibition Runs: February 15 – March 9, 2013 Opening Reception: Friday, February 15, 7–11pm
Untitled Art Society is please to present Safe Lights in the White Dwarf Gallery. This exhibition features the work of many Calgary-based photographers who incorporate analogue developing and printing as a crucial aspect of their artistic practice. 
 The level of research and technological knowledge required to create these images becomes a critical part of their conceptual framework. The act of printing in a darkroom and the relationships that each artist builds with his or her process is highly physical, time consuming and intimate.  The utilization of these highly traditional processes as a means of image making re-presents the art historical context of photography in a new and contemporary light. This exhibition can function as an artificial timeline. A wide range of technological eras is being presented, but contentiously marred and subverted with cues of the present day.  There is a continual binary tension created by these works. Past and present, precious and infinite, tangible and intangible all play into how darkroom photography functions as a contrast to digital photography as a contemporary form of art. 
 
Brandon Dalmer: CRISIUM
Exhibition Runs: March 28 – June 22, 2013Opening Reception: Friday, May 24, 8–11pm
CRISIUM will be a culmination of the construction of a small fictional spacecraft’s escape pod within the space. This project has a two phases that utilizes the space and installation. First being the actual construction of the craft, will be open to the public to observe as Dalmer constructs the dodecahedron. The second phase will be the exhibition itself, in which viewers are invited to peer inside (but never enter) the elaborate escape pod created by the artist.
Dalmer’s work using comic narrative to present symbolism and archetypes in a more accessible nature. This exhibition will also become a hub for communities to engage the educational elements of Dalmer’s work.
Throughout the process of installation viewers will be invited to enter, and interact with the artist as he creates his work and be exposed to the subtleties of the working process. Showcasing art in progress lends itself easily to advocacy for the arts. Viewers gain the opportunity to become far more engaged as they recognize and respect the commitment, skill, and knowledge involved in being an artist. 


 
Funding the Gallery
At this point in time, UAS does not have dedicated funds to program this gallery separately. Here’s where your contribution will go towards:

 Artist fees for Brandon Dalmer (he’s flying in from Toronto to complete this project!!)
Artist fees for the artists of Safe Lights
Supplies to keep this gallery looking swell (paint, lights, etc)
Funds to printing and hospitality for the opening receptions.

 
Having a little extra funds will really help to make this gallery a consitant part of UAS’s programming! Right now our priority is funding the two current projects, but anything beyond the cost of gallery supplies and artist fees used for these two shows will go towards making this gallery a sustainable part of UAS and funding future exhibitions in the white dwarf gallery!!

<p><b><u>WHY is my family´s plight ignored? WHY is such a case of blatant injustice ignored? Quote Lucritia Rouse</u></b></p>
<b><u>OPEN LETTER</u></b><p></p>
<p><b>Mr. Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney
General, Civil Rights Division </b></p>
<p><b>Mr. Brendon Johnson, US Attorney SD </b></p>
<p><b>Mr. Dennis Daugaard, Governor SD, former
head of Children’s Home Society 1990</b></p>
<p><b>Mr. James Anaya, United
Nations </b><b>Special Rapporteur</b></p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, <u>we are Lucritia Rouse,
Jessica Rouse, Fury Rouse, Trista Rouse and Rosemary Rouse.</u> </p>
<p>We are victims
of the SD foster service. A lot of so called ‘professional’ people build a
great career on our families’ misery. For 18 years we have been labeled as
sexually abused children when we were never abused. In reality the only people
that abused us are the state’s foster parents and law enforcement officials;
our so called 'guardian ad litem' who told the prosecutor she was going to
party if “we get these guys convicted”. This woman appointed by the court to
act in our ‘best interests’ was talking about our innocent uncles. <b>BUT IN THIS DAY AND AGE and IN THE GREATEST
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD you can only have justice if you can pay for it? WHY?</b>
Why does it cost thousands of <b>$$$$ Dollars</b>
for justice to be served when the truth is staring into your face? <b>WHY?</b> As small children we were kept
behind electric fences to keep us from escaping the <b>FOSTER ‘CONCENTRATION CAMP’</b>, to make sure we ‘performed’ at trial
as ‘instructed’ by government officials!!! It
has been 18 years and we have been crying to death ears that NO crime was ever
committed against us other then the civil rights violations against us, our
families and our innocent uncles. Where are the people with COURAGE who want to
stand up for what is right, for the constitution and the truth? FIVE young
women, victims of the government and foster care system ask you for help- but
who will have the courage to help us? Why is everybody looking the other way?<span> We would like to meet you and talk to you, we will meet
and talk and tell the truth, the truth needs to be known of what has happened
to us, our families. We have disgusting and sick stories to tell of how the
system that should protect children used and abused us. </span></p>
<p><b>WE WANT JUSTICE FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA! </b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Judges can be guilty of failure to prevent a
conspiracy in violation of 42 USCA 1986. See also 18 USC 1986</p>
<p>The Hyde Amendment, 18 U.S.C. #3006 (A) and the Equal Access
to Justice Act (EAJA), 28 U.S.C. #2412. These might also apply to a person’s
case. A defendant who prevails in a criminal case is entitled to a reasonable
attorney's fee and other litigation expenses, where the United States is
vexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith. Of course most people are never going to
reach the point where they can file for attorney fees and other litigation fees
because Judges are going to do everything in their power to see that a person’s
conviction is never overturned.</p>

He has no evidence other then Evidence of prosecutorial and judical misconduct,
racism, corruption and greed. There is PLENTY of evidence for that!!</p>
<p>Lucritia
Rouse, the spokesperson for the alleged victims and herself a victim of Judge
Piersol and his prosecutors Tapken and Schreier would like to ask all her

exactly do these people think they do know about US, the children that WE do

<p><b>Why did
you cut my long beautiful hair? There was no need, We had no lice, We caught

<p><b>Why did

<p><b>Why did
Judge Piersol, Prosecutors Tapken and Schreier, Holmes and guardian ad litem

<p><b>Why did

<p><b><u>BUT who
wants to write history and bring this out in the Open?</u></b></p>
<p>The
Rouse case was a very well-known ICWA case. The case is known for establishing
the Existing Indian Family Doctrine. Under the Doctrine, ICWA was not
applicable to Indian families if the parent(s) had no cultural connection to
their tribe. In other words, if enrolled parent(s) never returned to their
reservation, there was no cultural connection and, therefore, ICWA didn't
apply. The Existing Indian Family Doctrine was used in several cases and
several states adopted it in regard to out of home placement.<br/>

<p>The Rouse case is the tip of an iceberg. AND it is
the ONLY case that combines within all the motives and interactions that make
South Dakota the most racist state in the union. There simply is no other case
like the Rouse case.</p>

What happened 20 years ago?


In 1994 the State of South Dakota in cooperation with the FBI and corrupt YS Tribal Officials and chairman removed 11 children from their home on the Yankton Sioux Reservation without a removal order or affidavit. The removal itself was at gun point and illegal.
If this was a play these would be the different stages of plot development…
1. First scene squad cars surround the house and screaming kids are taken
2. Children held at bia office till late at night asking over and over why they have been taken and they can't to go home
3. Foster mothers Donna and Jean cutting the crying childrens hair
4. Interviews with FBI Wim van Roe and Dan Hudspeth (who impersonates FBI Agent), children crying and asking to go to the toilet and asking for food, the fbi denies this and keeps pointing at penises and dolls!!
5. Foster mother Donna Jordan and Jean Brock telling the girls its ok to lie, just lie and you will come home to your family and your uncles and dads will be home too, just lie and we feed you
6. Scene with the alcohol baths, childs face pushed in the soup bowl, another baby kicked down the stairs. locks on the fridge doors, Doog food for the native kids
7. Children searching for food in the barn and stealing the food from the dogs and other animals in desperation
8. Medical exams, doctors raping the girls with colposcopy examination, inserting a metal camera into anus and vagina BUT take no pictures of their disgusting 'EXAMINATION'
9. Court room, children waving at uncles in the dock, guardian ad litem eva cheney ushering them away, throws coat over Jessica to stop her calling out to her uncles in the dock for help
10. Testimony in a secret room via video camera, prosecutor asking the question, guardian ad litem commanding to each child the 'RIGHT' answer ,eva cheney says: ""If we convict these guys we go party tonight!!""
11. Verdict is read, grandmother Rosemary Rouse faints, all the mothers faint, screaming and crying
12.Appeal by lucritia rouse for help and for a voice
13. 4 men remain in prison after 20 years with no evidence whatsoever just lies and words by fbi and  social workers, third party statements
The State of South Dakota is holding 4 innocent Native American men in prison without any credible evidence. Requests to judge Lawrence Piersol, 8th Circuit South Dakota to release the 'evidence' have been denied, even to the incarcerated men!
If the state of South Dakota and judge Piersol continue to withold the federal evidence one can challenge EVERYTHING. There is no adjucation, no probable cause and HENCE no reason to hold these innocent men in prison.
Their names are Jesse Rouse, Desmond Rouse, Garfield Feather and Russell Hubbeling. The have now been incarcerated for 20 years.
I ask you WHY?
WHY is my family´s plight ignored? WHY is such a case of blatant injustice ignored? Quote Lucritia Rouse
OPEN LETTER
Mr. Thomas E. Perez, Assistant Attorney
General, Civil Rights Division 
Mr. Brendon Johnson, US Attorney SD 
Mr. Dennis Daugaard, Governor SD, former
head of Children’s Home Society 1990
Mr. James Anaya, United
Nations Special Rapporteur
Ladies and Gentlemen, we are Lucritia Rouse,
Jessica Rouse, Fury Rouse, Trista Rouse and Rosemary Rouse. 
We are victims
of the SD foster service. A lot of so called ‘professional’ people build a
great career on our families’ misery. For 18 years we have been labeled as
sexually abused children when we were never abused. In reality the only people
that abused us are the state’s foster parents and law enforcement officials;
our so called 'guardian ad litem' who told the prosecutor she was going to
party if “we get these guys convicted”. This woman appointed by the court to
act in our ‘best interests’ was talking about our innocent uncles. BUT IN THIS DAY AND AGE and IN THE GREATEST
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD you can only have justice if you can pay for it? WHY?
Why does it cost thousands of $$$$ Dollars
for justice to be served when the truth is staring into your face? WHY? As small children we were kept
behind electric fences to keep us from escaping the FOSTER ‘CONCENTRATION CAMP’, to make sure we ‘performed’ at trial
as ‘instructed’ by government officials!!! It
has been 18 years and we have been crying to death ears that NO crime was ever
committed against us other then the civil rights violations against us, our
families and our innocent uncles. Where are the people with COURAGE who want to
stand up for what is right, for the constitution and the truth? FIVE young
women, victims of the government and foster care system ask you for help- but
who will have the courage to help us? Why is everybody looking the other way? We would like to meet you and talk to you, we will meet
and talk and tell the truth, the truth needs to be known of what has happened
to us, our families. We have disgusting and sick stories to tell of how the
system that should protect children used and abused us. 
WE WANT JUSTICE FROM THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA! 


Judges can be guilty of failure to prevent a
conspiracy in violation of 42 USCA 1986. See also 18 USC 1986
The Hyde Amendment, 18 U.S.C. #3006 (A) and the Equal Access
to Justice Act (EAJA), 28 U.S.C. #2412. These might also apply to a person’s
case. A defendant who prevails in a criminal case is entitled to a reasonable
attorney's fee and other litigation expenses, where the United States is
vexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith. Of course most people are never going to
reach the point where they can file for attorney fees and other litigation fees
because Judges are going to do everything in their power to see that a person’s
conviction is never overturned.





In 1994 the State of South Dakota in cooperation
with the FBI and corrupt tribal officials removed 11 children from their home
on the Yankton Sioux Reservation without a removal order or affidavit. The

The State of South Dakota is holding 4 innocent Native
American men in prison without any credible evidence. Requests to judge Lawrence
Piersol, 8th Circuit South Dakota to release the 'evidence' have
been denied, even to the incarcerated men!

If the state of South Dakota and judge Piersol continue to

adjucation, no probable cause and HENCE no reason to hold these innocent men in
prison.
Their names are Jesse Rouse, Desmond Rouse, Garfield
Feather and Russell Hubbeling. The have now been incarcerated for 20 years.


I ask you WHY?



WHY is my family´s plight ignored?
WHY is such a case of blatant injustice ignored? Quote Lucritia Rouse

Why does
Judge Piersol not want to share his evidence on How guilty these 4 men are?
Because
He has no evidence other then Evidence of prosecutorial and judical misconduct,
racism, corruption and greed. There is PLENTY of evidence for that!!
Lucritia
Rouse, the spokesperson for the alleged victims and herself a victim of Judge
Piersol and his prosecutors Tapken and Schreier would like to ask all her
abusers to take a lie detector test and let her ask the questions.
What
exactly do these people think they do know about US, the children that WE do
not know? What does Judge Piersol know that we do not know?
What did
we do to deserve to be treated worse then animals are treated by the white
people of South Dakota?
Why did
you starve me?
Why did
you call me a 'dirty indian'?
Why did
you cut my long beautiful hair? There was no need, We had no lice, We caught
lice at the foster home...
Why did
you not get me medial attention? If my uncles raped and sodomised me and i was
so ripped and torn? Why did you not bring me to a hospital straight away?
But
instead you gave me alcohol baths? Why did I have to sit in burning alcohol up
to my neck?
Why did
you tell me to lie if I want to go home to my mum? Why did you say it is ok to
lie?
Why did
Judge Piersol, Prosecutors Tapken and Schreier, Holmes and guardian ad litem
Cheney STOP us from hugging and kissing our uncles and telling them that we
love them and that they love us?
Why did
I have to have a metal instrument inserted into my vagina and my anus hurting
me by two so-called doctors. 

Those
doctors hurt and abused me and injured me with their so-called examination? 
Why is
it ok for these doctors Kaplan and Ferrel to rape me?
Why can
Nobody interview our uncles in prison? Whs is this a safety risk and forbidden
to the press? Why is the press denied access to the TRUTH about what really
happened to all of us?
If my
uncles are so guilty why is Judge Piersol hiding the evidence for a Civil
Rights Lawsuit? Why is the State of South Dakota controlling the Truth and the
Press?
We have
a Civil Rights Lawsuit using
a SUCCESSFUL case in the United States Court of Federal Claims! 
http://www.narf.org/nill/bulletins/dct/documents/elk.pdfAND we have a multi-million $  DAMAGE CLAIM
under 42-USC 1983 for Genocide against 4 families and unlawful incarceration of
4 innocent men.
BUT who
wants to write history and bring this out in the Open?
The
Rouse case was a very well-known ICWA case. The case is known for establishing
the Existing Indian Family Doctrine. Under the Doctrine, ICWA was not
applicable to Indian families if the parent(s) had no cultural connection to
their tribe. In other words, if enrolled parent(s) never returned to their
reservation, there was no cultural connection and, therefore, ICWA didn't
apply. The Existing Indian Family Doctrine was used in several cases and
several states adopted it in regard to out of home placement.
25 USC § 1911 - Indian tribe jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings
| LII / Legal Informwww.law.cornell.edu
The Rouse case is the tip of an iceberg. AND it is
the ONLY case that combines within all the motives and interactions that make
South Dakota the most racist state in the union. There simply is no other case
like the Rouse case.
Everybody
involved has made a big career out of the misery of children, mothers and
loving families. These people need to be DRAGGED into the light for their
disgusting, repellent  and abhorent actions in the name of justice.

<h3>Meet Friday Knights</h3>
<p>  Friday Knights is a collective of some of
the most eccentric and creative emerging artists from Detroit. Our artists have
collaborated with several notable organizations in Metro-Detroit including The
Heidelberg Project, Detroit Design Festival, and The Detroit Institute of Arts.
Now, we're aiming for new heights and developing more innovative ways to share
our art outside of our city limits.</p>
<p>  This campaign is to fund our Visions
tour. Inspired by that desire to bring our art and creativity to new places, we

is a means to bring our passions &amp; perspectives from Detroit to different
cities, both around the country and around the globe.  The Visions tour will not only show us new
horizons and add to our creative ideas, but, hopefully, it will enlighten
others to our views on this world we all share, through our ability to create. <i>Our goal is to showcase our artwork in seven
to ten different cities in one year.</i></p>
<p>By
making a contribution, you can help us move closer to our dreams. Beyond taking
our art beyond borders, the Visions tour will allow us to grow as working
artists. Visions has the potential to prove that anything is possible when we
all band together to help one another. It is our hope that Visions will
encourage the people around us to grow as well.</p>

<p>Any
contribution, large or small, is appreciated! Each giving level includes unique
perks, from stickers, pins, and apparel to a one of a kind piece of artwork or
a customized mural.</p>
<p>  If we do not reach our goal to fund the

dream a reality. Whether we make $50 or $1000, we will find a way to go on
tour. We will do everything we can to showcase our work and bring something
unique to different cities around the world with the support from people who
believe in us and our dreams. </p>
<h3>Supporting Our Dreams &amp;
Goals</h3>
<p>  Have you ever had a dream or goal that you
couldn't reach alone and needed a little help along the way? For us, this is
one of those dreams. Where we come from, the Visions tour is an impossible goal
in the minds many, but we want to show everyone that you can do anything you
truly set your mind to, regardless of systems in place that are working against
you. We hope today’s youth will be able to look at this as a mark, that art is
still alive and thriving. </p>
<p>We
plan to show contributors and the world how far we can take this project and
how far we advance even after it is finished. In the end, we hope the artwork
we introduce to the world will leave some type of impact on people; <b>art that ignites a feeling like no other.</b></p>
<h3>The Bumpy Road</h3>
<p>Creating
this tour is a huge challenge. There are many pot-holes on this road we're on
and we need the best vehicle to get through it all. </p>
<p>Our
main focus is confirming each stop on the Visions tour, but then comes the
worry of transporting the artwork and ourselves between stops, having a place
to stay, and creating unique pieces of artwork for each unique city (7-10
locations in just one year). </p>
<p>To
solve these issues, we work as a team. No artist will face these challenges
alone, we will face them as a collective and to the best of our ability, no
matter what happens along the way. We’re currently in the process of booking
galleries and venues for the tour, to give ourselves time for possible cancellations.
We're also working on multiple pieces for the shows in order to have them set
for each location. Finally, we’re busy mapping the most efficient way to travel
between locations (regardless of mode), and the most sensible places to stay
for each stop on the tour.</p>
<h3>Anything Helps</h3>
<p>  If you cannot contribute to this
campaign but would still like to support, there are many ways you can help us
pursue our dream.</p>
<p>  Just sharing this campaign through
social sites and emails is a huge help. Spreading the word, not only about this
campaign but who we are, and what we are trying to achieve will help create an
impact beyond our imaginations. You can look for progress from looking up the
hashtag <u>#KnightLife</u>. Also if you would like the Friday Knight$ to come
to your city and you can connect us to a gallery or venue, email <u>TGIFKS@gmail.com.</u></p>
<p>When
this is all said and done, we, as artists, are nothing without supporters. We
appreciate anything, and everything, that you can do to help us reach our
goals. </p>

</div></div>","Meet Friday Knights
  Friday Knights is a collective of some of
the most eccentric and creative emerging artists from Detroit. Our artists have
collaborated with several notable organizations in Metro-Detroit including The
Heidelberg Project, Detroit Design Festival, and The Detroit Institute of Arts.
Now, we're aiming for new heights and developing more innovative ways to share
our art outside of our city limits.
  This campaign is to fund our Visions
tour. Inspired by that desire to bring our art and creativity to new places, we
decided to put paint to pavement. If musicians can tour, why can’t we? Visions
is a means to bring our passions & perspectives from Detroit to different

<h3>#### WOW! Well guys THANK YOU! We are over our original funding goal! I want to update you with stretch goals further down the page to see why your contribution still counts! <span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">####</span>
</h3>
<div><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<h3>About this:</h3>The Weird Girls Project is an ongoing art film series created and produced by concept artist Kitty Von-Sometime which is created to empower the women who take part.</div><div>
<p>Fed up of the media marketing of what a woman's figure should look like and the effect it had on women imposing boundaries to themselves, Kitty started making these pieces, using the 'music video' format to put exposure on the variety of shapes and sizes that make us who we are. </p>
<p>Volunteer participants take part on a set date and are unaware of any part of the plan until they turn up. This includes the concept, location and costumes. For<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> three months Kitty and the crew plan the piece in secret, and it culminates in a day’s shooting which becomes a film.</span></p>
<p>The main element of the project is ‘release to the unknown’ and apart from the film the Project focuses on the event itself and how the women react, improvise and morph within costume, learning about their power of self combined with the strength of coming together as a group. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The Project uses voluntary individuals rather than engaging professional performers or models and part of the ethos is to develop increased self-confidence, especially focusing on body issues and a release of inhibitions. The women are varying in ages, backgrounds and experience, and do not necessarily know each other before the day.</p>
<p>There have been multiple Episodes in Iceland as well as successful financing abroad in Europe and as far away as China. However, without this appeal, the Project will continue to grow abroad without keeping its roots in Iceland, where it was born and developed.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The money we are appealing for goes on:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">the hiring of film equipment </span><br/>

</ul>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">In return you can scoop up some of our fantastic perks and feel involved in the production of an art piece which is more than just pretty.</span></p>
<p>For the women in Iceland who have appealed to take part in the Project, the waiting has been 2 years long, you can help bring the series to life again. This appeal is for the cost of the location, costume and equipment only. All crew members including Kitty are producing this voluntarily. The appeal is simply to fund the materials needed for work itself.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>The amount of money in the target would allow around 18 women to take part.  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">There are many more waiting to be included and any financing above this figure would help allow for more women to take part in the piece. </span></p>
<p>If the fundraising gathers momentum far beyond its total, we can invest in better equipment and even an exhibition of prints from the piece. </p>
<div><b><h3>New Stretch Goals:</h3></b></div>
<div><ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">As we have gone over our total we have added 2 more women and can afford to feed the volunteer crew for the day!</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">If we reach 150% we can invest in higher grade equipment to produce a piece at a standard which will definitely get the video and message on further mainstream platforms</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">If we reach 200% we can host an exhibition of images from the piece.</span><br/>
</li>

<h3>##### Dollar Drive! #####</h3>We are pushing the $1 drive with this fundraiser. We understand that not everyone has money lying around. But if you can spare just $1 it makes so MUCH MORE difference to our campaign than simply liking or sharing it. </div><div>Liking, sharing, tweeting are great for awareness but mostly leads to more liking, sharing and tweeting. Adding $1 pushes our campaign towards its goal and raises activity on our campaign.</div><div>

In its history it has pushed individuals who take part to feel better about themselves and beyond that, has encouraged women to welcome who they are. The more successful projects like this are, the more the message of being happy in your own skin gets across. </p>
<p>In total across the world, 23 pieces have been made in this series, each one individual in its own right. All have been executed successfully. You can be certain that your donation will be secure - supporting a finished film.</p>

What We Need & What You Get The money we are appealing for goes on:



the hiring of film equipment 


costume materials

<p>                                             How does one study a culture? </p>
<p>My documentary film, “Mātauranga,” offers a unique way to answer
this question by engaging with the Māori based theory of Kaupapa Māori (<a href=""http://www.rangahau.co.nz/research-idea/27/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.rangahau.co.nz/research-idea/27/</a>). This indigenous school of thought serves as an alternative
to traditional, dominant practices of ethnographic research. By challenging
colonial ideological frameworks, Kaupapa Māori aims to revitalize Māori culture and help reassess traditional research
practices in the United States. The film looks at the theory’s impact on Māori society and its potential to encourage new research
methodologies in the field of ethnography.</p>
<p>To more effectively convey
the principles of Kaupapa Māori, “Mātauranga”
includes performance art by Māori artists. Incorporating performances in the film
address the significance of using fiction as a platform for ethnography and to
ultimately critique early twentieth century ethnographic films of indigenous
men and women.</p>

You will receive a card stock weight calendar featuring a <strong>FULL COLOR NATURE PRINT</strong> on the inside cover, <strong>AND TWELVE</strong> <strong>removable monthly black and white illustrations!</strong> While the cover is glossy, the inside pages are matte, which means they are<strong> ideal for pencils crayons or markers</strong> <strong>to color if and when you want!</strong>!</p>

<p>Want to give one as a gift? Look for the <strong>'Doodle me This'</strong> perk, That gets you <strong>two autographed copies of the Coloring Calendar</strong>, and one of a kind<strong> hand drawn special doodle</strong> on the month of your choice! In the comic book biz, it is called 'signed and remarked'... A totally <strong>remarkable</strong> perk for sure!</p>

<h3>Who are we?! </h3>
<p>We are <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/goodstorestudio/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Good Store Studio</a>! A trio of independent brands who joined forces to create an umbrella brand bringing you independent goodness. In this dream team is Josie Irvine of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/palaceflophouse/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Palace Flophouse</a>, Beth Izzard of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/thediysupermarket/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The DIY Supermarket</a> and Emma White of <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/duvetdaysclothing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Duvet Days</a>, with the same ethos and passion for independent work it was the perfect match for us to come together and create <strong>Good Store Studio ✨</strong></p>
<p>We wanted to be not just a lifestyle store stocking independent goods, we wanted a space that everyone could enjoy, with an <strong>open plan textile studio</strong> out the back and goal to host <strong>workshops</strong> for other local independents, we started our journey in<a href=""https://www.twoscompanystudios.com/the-studios"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Two's Company Studios</a>. We had hoped to be a permanent fixture in <strong>Old Market</strong>, but we sadly had to just pop-up due to the building being turned into flats by the landlord in the near future. To say the pop-up went well would be an understatement, we were overwhelmed with the response and support you all gave us and our brainchild.</p>
<p>But now our stars have aligned and we have amazingly been able to find a <u><i><strong>new store</strong></i></u> to open by the end of the year, the contracts are in place and it's all systems go! It's in <strong>Old Market</strong> and has heaps of potential, the only downside is it needs quite a bit of work to get it looking top-notch.</p>
<p>Our vision is to create a<strong> lifestyle store/textile studio</strong> as we had before in Two's Company but also <strong>creative desk spaces</strong> that can be rented by <strong>local creatives</strong>. Not only that but the shop/textile studio will all be <strong>easily manoeuvrable for workshops, events</strong> and anything that works in our new store! What we're hoping is to create a <strong>community hub</strong> that offers something for everyone, a place people feel comfortable in, and is part of the Old Market community ✌️</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">And What Do We Want?</span></h3>
<p>We're asking for a flexible goal of <strong>£10,000</strong>, this will support us in totally transforming the new space to be the best it can be. This will include <strong>building work</strong> such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>a partition wall to separate the space out for our creative desks so we all have some privacy</li>
<li>new flooring (nobody likes office carpet tiles...)</li>
<li>plastering, painting and tiling</li>
<li>shop fittings to showcase our brilliant stock </li>
<li>large fixtures that are custom built to be able to move when we have workshops/talks/clubs using the space, e.g pattern cutting table, till desk area, central display for stock that doubles as a workshop table and many more nifty contraptions! </li>
<li>a show-stopping new shop front</li>
</ul>
<p>We'd also love this to help us get Good Store up and running smoothly so we can focus on getting people booked in to use the workshop space, manage our new desk spaces and ensure the lifestyle store is beautifully stocked so ideally, we would use the cash for <strong>set up costs</strong> such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>PRS licence</li>
<li>Contents insurance</li>
<li>The first round of bills- gas, electric, water, internet and all that jazz</li>
</ul>
<p>And obviously, there are all the bits that you don't even think about that crop up so anything earnt in this campaign will be <u><strong>SO</strong></u> much appreciated. We've chosen a <strong>flexible </strong>funding option so if we don't reach our goal we'll still get all of the donations to use towards our venture.</p>
<p><strong>BUT of course you lovely lot don't just get the amazing feeling of helping a new business find it's feet, we have some <u>AMAZING</u> pledge options for you, from creative lessons to one-off pieces, we've literally got something for everyone.</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Good Store Studio is Needed...</h3>
<p>Bristol has had an insanely sad amount of creative venues closed down over the last few years, we <strong><u>need</u></strong> more affordable spaces for people to feel <strong>creative and connected</strong>.</p>
<p>The ability to have multiple <strong>creative desk spaces</strong> is so exciting and gifts itself as a welcoming workspace to see creative things happening to inspire others in their day to day work setup. Working in a sociable setting has been seen to enhance proactive working and boost morale, there's a reason creatives in spaces thrive off each other! <strong>Beth was previously the studio manager at Two's Company Studios and has seen this first hand, </strong><i>""The community that surrounds a creative space is something truly special, I thought I worked well at home until I had my own studio and then, funnily enough, I got <u>SO</u> much more work done. You can bounce ideas off each other or just take a break from your desk and have a bit of social time, something a lot of freelancers forget they can do!""</i></p>
<p>With the three of us coming from creative arts backgrounds, with a heavy dose of event planning and logistical minds mixed in, it was obvious that we wanted the Good Store Studio to serve as a <strong>bookable space for anything creative</strong>. Whether it's workshops, talks, book clubs, monthly meet up clubs, we want the store to be a <strong>safe and inclusive</strong> space for people to come and explore their passion. As discussed before Bristol has a severe lack of affordable smaller spaces that are hireable by the hour. We want to change that!  </p>
<p>Our lifestyle store can be a hub for <strong>discovering new indie designers and brands</strong>. With the urge to shop consciously and support independents becoming the norm, we want to be a go-to store that is affordable and accessible for handmade goods. This is not only for the customer but for the seller too, we want to be able to support new creatives in their endeavours in a way that is fair to their art.</p>
<p>In recent times, we feel that focus has been lost on the hard work that goes into the fashion industry, with fast fashion still prevailing. We also understand that fashion-based environments can be daunting, but we want that to change and be an open space that people enjoy coming too. Working mainly with commissions, Palace Flophouse and Duvet Days show you that they don't need to be overpriced and inaccessible, they can be for everyone. It's so important that clothes fit well and are loved; people are more likely to hold onto them forever and cherish their pieces. You'll also be able to speak to Palace Flophouse and Duvet Days about their creations instore with their workspace entwined into the building, it will break down the divide of not knowing <strong>who has made your clothes </strong>as they will have been created right in front of you in their <strong>textile studio</strong>. They will have a face and a personality with <strong>perks</strong> such as free repairs offered and being able to talk about every aspect of your garment.</p>

</ul></div>","Who are we?! 
We are Good Store Studio! A trio of independent brands who joined forces to create an umbrella brand bringing you independent goodness. In this dream team is Josie Irvine of Palace Flophouse, Beth Izzard of The DIY Supermarket and Emma White of Duvet Days, with the same ethos and passion for independent work it was the perfect match for us to come together and create Good Store Studio ✨
We wanted to be not just a lifestyle store stocking independent goods, we wanted a space that everyone could enjoy, with an open plan textile studio out the back and goal to host workshops for other local independents, we started our journey in Two's Company Studios. We had hoped to be a permanent fixture in Old Market, but we sadly had to just pop-up due to the building being turned into flats by the landlord in the near future. To say the pop-up went well would be an understatement, we were overwhelmed with the response and support you all gave us and our brainchild.
But now our stars have aligned and we have amazingly been able to find a new store to open by the end of the year, the contracts are in place and it's all systems go! It's in Old Market and has heaps of potential, the only downside is it needs quite a bit of work to get it looking top-notch.
Our vision is to create a lifestyle store/textile studio as we had before in Two's Company but also creative desk spaces that can be rented by local creatives. Not only that but the shop/textile studio will all be easily manoeuvrable for workshops, events and anything that works in our new store! What we're hoping is to create a community hub that offers something for everyone, a place people feel comfortable in, and is part of the Old Market community ✌️
 

And What Do We Want?
We're asking for a flexible goal of £10,000, this will support us in totally transforming the new space to be the best it can be. This will include building work such as:

a partition wall to separate the space out for our creative desks so we all have some privacy
new flooring (nobody likes office carpet tiles...)
plastering, painting and tiling
shop fittings to showcase our brilliant stock 
large fixtures that are custom built to be able to move when we have workshops/talks/clubs using the space, e.g pattern cutting table, till desk area, central display for stock that doubles as a workshop table and many more nifty contraptions! 
a show-stopping new shop front

We'd also love this to help us get Good Store up and running smoothly so we can focus on getting people booked in to use the workshop space, manage our new desk spaces and ensure the lifestyle store is beautifully stocked so ideally, we would use the cash for set up costs such as:

PRS licence
Contents insurance
The first round of bills- gas, electric, water, internet and all that jazz

And obviously, there are all the bits that you don't even think about that crop up so anything earnt in this campaign will be SO much appreciated. We've chosen a flexible funding option so if we don't reach our goal we'll still get all of the donations to use towards our venture.
BUT of course you lovely lot don't just get the amazing feeling of helping a new business find it's feet, we have some AMAZING pledge options for you, from creative lessons to one-off pieces, we've literally got something for everyone.

Why Good Store Studio is Needed...
Bristol has had an insanely sad amount of creative venues closed down over the last few years, we need more affordable spaces for people to feel creative and connected.
The ability to have multiple creative desk spaces is so exciting and gifts itself as a welcoming workspace to see creative things happening to inspire others in their day to day work setup. Working in a sociable setting has been seen to enhance proactive working and boost morale, there's a reason creatives in spaces thrive off each other! Beth was previously the studio manager at Two's Company Studios and has seen this first hand, ""The community that surrounds a creative space is something truly special, I thought I worked well at home until I had my own studio and then, funnily enough, I got SO much more work done. You can bounce ideas off each other or just take a break from your desk and have a bit of social time, something a lot of freelancers forget they can do!""
With the three of us coming from creative arts backgrounds, with a heavy dose of event planning and logistical minds mixed in, it was obvious that we wanted the Good Store Studio to serve as a bookable space for anything creative. Whether it's workshops, talks, book clubs, monthly meet up clubs, we want the store to be a safe and inclusive space for people to come and explore their passion. As discussed before Bristol has a severe lack of affordable smaller spaces that are hireable by the hour. We want to change that!  
Our lifestyle store can be a hub for discovering new indie designers and brands. With the urge to shop consciously and support independents becoming the norm, we want to be a go-to store that is affordable and accessible for handmade goods. This is not only for the customer but for the seller too, we want to be able to support new creatives in their endeavours in a way that is fair to their art.
In recent times, we feel that focus has been lost on the hard work that goes into the fashion industry, with fast fashion still prevailing. We also understand that fashion-based environments can be daunting, but we want that to change and be an open space that people enjoy coming too. Working mainly with commissions, Palace Flophouse and Duvet Days show you that they don't need to be overpriced and inaccessible, they can be for everyone. It's so important that clothes fit well and are loved; people are more likely to hold onto them forever and cherish their pieces. You'll also be able to speak to Palace Flophouse and Duvet Days about their creations instore with their workspace entwined into the building, it will break down the divide of not knowing who has made your clothes as they will have been created right in front of you in their textile studio. They will have a face and a personality with perks such as free repairs offered and being able to talk about every aspect of your garment.

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598885872/t0cpspogrfnfszh3vtuz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>100 Years of Voting Rights for Women</h3>
<p>Maren Conrad, one of California's most inspiring and active muralists, is seeking to inspire citizens to make their voices heard this November! </p>
<p>To commemorate 100 years of the 19th Amendment since its passage in 1920 we are seeking funds to celebrate the lives of 19 lesser known, but massively impactful suffragettes. These women helped secure women the right to vote through the campaigning for and signing of the 19th Amendment. More often than not these women – already marginalized by their sex and gender – were also seen as lesser due to their race, background, and sexuality and thus have been forgotten by mainstream history books. </p>
<p>The mural will be located at 19th and K Streets wrapping around the WEAVE, Inc. building in Midtown Sacramento and wrap around the west, north, and east sides.</p>
<p>This mural will not only bring these leaders to the forefront but inspire today's citizens to become active voters and community participants while also reclaiming part of Sacramento for the community.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598885984/oeo1worzg7nohlirihyw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking $20,000 in order to prep the site, purchase supplies, and ensure lighting and graffiti protection as well as provide fair wages for the lead artists and the all-female assistant artist crew. </p>
<p>A number of unique perks are available from suffrage-themed art prints to one-of-a-kind commissions from Sacramento's favorite muralist. Most exciting are the plaques that will be mounted with the mural, displaying the names of informed and compassionate voters who make this public art piece possible.</p>
<h3>About the Mural</h3>
<p>The mural's goal is two-fold: inspiration and education.</p>
<p>The mural will inspire all citizens to register to vote and have their voices heard. Voting is one of the great unifiers of our nation — a calling where every individual regardless of party affiliation, gender, race, sexual orientation, religion or any other identity can agree to its importance in shaping our communities, state, and nation. </p>
<p>By creating a unique selfie-focused destination mural, we hope to encourage community activism, drive voter registration, and a generate place to gather and reflect before heading to the polls. Furthermore, as COVID-19 impacts in-person voting, this interactive mural provides a place for people to declare to the world that they voted. </p>
<p>The other goal is education. We want to bring the names, stories, and voices of important suffragettes to the forefront. The struggle for the right for women to vote nationwide was one borne by women of various backgrounds, but all sharing one ideal: that women's ideas of a more perfect union are equal to that of men. QR codes next to each portrait will connect viewers through their phones to short biographies of the women to help people learn about these suffragists; essentially, turning the building into a virtual outdoor history museum.</p>

</p>
<p>I’m Jessica Pleyel, an artist/activist/educator located in
Iowa City. I am humbled and honored to be an artist-in-residence at
Feast Arts Center in Tacoma for the month of August! During this residency, I will be organizing a version of the <i>To(get)her</i>
project, teaching four community-wide classes, and creating a new project expanding to discussion on gun violence in the
United States. </p>
<h3><b>What is <i>To(get)her</i>?</b></h3>
<p>The <i>To(get)her </i>project brings a variety of self-identifying women
together to destroy wax assault rifles with domestic tools.
These guns act as a metaphor for the violence that happens to many women on a
daily basis. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Not only are many of our bodies
attacked mentally, physically and sexually, but also the government stakes
claim on our bodies. With 138 representatives voting against the Violence
Against Women Act (VAWA), and many of those same representatives also voting
against stricter gun regulations it is apparent that these politicians do
not see it problematic that women's bodies are targets.</p>
<p>The ways in which the women choose to melt the guns vary, as well as the domestic tools they utilize. When the women come together, their connections are empowering, often fierce, sometimes gentle, and always meaningful.</p>
<p>As women, when we are together and our voices are loud -- and in unison, we are <b><u>strong</u></b>.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need:</h3> <p></p>
<p>The funding goal to get the <i>To(get)her</i> projects up and
running at Feast Arts Center in Tacoma is $3500. This will cover shipping
artworks, transportation expenses, and buying and creating new
materials for the next <i>To(get)her</i> projects.</p>
<p>Anything surplus funds that exceed the goal will be donated to the Women’s Support Shelter in Tacoma.
</p>
<p>If you donate to the <i>To(get)her </i>project, you will receive special perks and gifts from previous and current versions of the project, and be thanked at the exhibition!</p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact:</h3> <p></p>
<p>The To(get)her project has previously been performed in two iterations. Both versions have successfully brought communites together to discuss the pertinent issues
of sexual assault and domestic violence in the United States. 1 in 4 women will
be in a domestic violence situation and 1 in 6 will be raped in their
lifetimes-- and these are the women who come forward. Many women, myself
included, do not come forward to persecute their
perpetrator for fear of retaliation, triggering memories, or the understanding
that most assailants will never see jail time. </p>
<p>Through these performances, women have found solace in one
another and themselves through the catharsis of melting and destroying wax
assault rifles.</p>
<p>These women have been able to share as much of their
stories as they feel comfortable in a safe and loving space. The <i>To(get)her</i>
project is about community and growth, and it is my hope to bring together a
community of self-identified women in Tacoma to create a new version and spark
discussion within this community.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While at Feast Arts Center, I will also be initiating an open community project, in which we will be melting wax assault rifles with domestic tools as a means of catharsis and criticism of the many mass shootings that have plagued the US in recent history. This collective melting of guns will be turned into a painting that will be hung in the gallery for the duration of the art exhibit.</p>
<p>Finally, I will be teaching four classes while at Feast which include: Mold Making 101, Introduction to Healthy Relationships, Performance Strategies, and Embodied Autobiography. These classes will be open to the community.</p>

All we need is a little boost to get off the ground. That's why early subscriptions are so important. </p><br/><p>1) Subscriptions</p><p>Support early, and make CSArt Ottawa a reality. Keep your finger on the pulse of the Ottawa arts scene by letting CSArt Ottawa keep you up to date on who’s moving and shaking in our community. Get 5 original, limited editions art works per year, access to exclusive arts events, and opportunities to meet the artists. If we can get 20 early subscribers by the end of this campaign ($8000), then we can get a move on making our first season as amazing as possible. Every subscription counts.</p><br/><p>2) Supply Fund </p><p>Our goal is to pay artists for their work: their creative ideas, and the time and sweat it takes to make them happen. So how do we make that possible for the art forms that cost a lot to produce (theatre, music), paying those artists the same as those in art forms that cost less to produce (writing, storytelling)? We created the Supply Fund to answer that question. Our season's artists can access the CSArt Supply Fund to help level the playing field. We aim to have a supply fund starter of $1200 by the end of this campaign. The more we have in our Supply Fund, the more diverse art forms we can support --and as Canada's first multi-disciplinary community-supported art project, that's really important to us. </p><br/><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Do you reject the idea that Ottawa is boring? Good. So do we.</p><p>There’s a gap separating artists and patrons in Ottawa. Let’s close it, let’s recognize our artists as important contributors to our city, let’s build community, and let’s have a hell of a good time doing it.</p><p>CSArt Ottawa will pay artists to create original work, make this work accessible to patrons, and add to the great stuff happening in our city. </p><br/><h3>Team</h3><p>Megan Piercey Monafu is an Ottawa-based artist who makes things happen. With a diverse background in writing, directing, facilitating, community development, and start-ups, Megan has the connections and skills to get this off the ground and to shine a spotlight on Ottawa’s arts community.</p><p>But she won’t do it alone --the CSArt Advisory Committee is there to help, with skills in marketing, outreach, finance, event planning, web design, and more. With a full leadership team of 6 plus a first season involving 14 of Ottawa’s finest artists, CSArt Ottawa is set to knock yer socks off.</p><br/><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>Artists are risky people. It’s true. They set out with a seed of an idea and a little pocket change, and who knows what they’ll end up creating.</p><p>Patrons are risky too. Audiences change their minds all the time about whether or not they like an artist, and artists spend a lot of time and energy trying to figure out what will entertain and touch their patrons.</p><p>We want to build a relationship of trust and respect between artists and patrons, providing patrons with a way to support artists financially and artists a new way to connect with patrons. Together, we share in the risk of the creation process. But, we also share in whatever awesome stuff comes out of it.</p><br/><h3>Why are the subscriptions so damn expensive?</h3><p>It’s a challenge of our initiative: providing enough cash to artists that they can create original work for all of our subscribers, while still being financially accessible to subscribers. The money spent on subscriptions goes to the artists’ labour, the event planning, the supplies, and getting the art to you.</p><p>Think of this way: if last year you bought 2-3 pieces of art, 2 tickets to a live concert, and 2 tickets to a theatre performance, you probably spent at least $400 all told. We’re asking you to take the leap of spending that money up front, and then have all these things provided to you throughout the year. That means all your money stays in Ottawa, supporting our local economy, with the added bonus that the art is designed specifically with you in mind. </p><br/><p></p><h3>About Community-Supported Art:</h3><p>Community-Supported Art is modeled after the Community-Supported Agriculture (or ‘farm share’) model of food distribution, where customers deal directly with farmers, investing funds at the beginning of the growing season. This upfront investment allows the farmers to create a harvest of healthy, organic, and local food, which is delivered to customers on a weekly basis throughout the harvest. Everyone shares in the inherent risk of farming as well as in the bounty of a good harvest, and buyers are more connected to their food, to the natural season, and to the local economy.</p><p>The <a href=""http://springboardforthearts.org/community-supported-art-csa/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">first CSArt project</a> was created by Springboard for the Arts in St. Paul, Minnesota, and has since been replicated across the US as well as in <a href=""http://cobaltconnects.ca/blog/cobalt-blog/building-new-models"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hamilton/Burlington, ON</a> and <a href=""http://www.partagemontreal.ca/news/2015/6/28/partage-montral-launches-citys-first-community-supported-art-project"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Montreal, QC</a>.</p><p>CSArt Ottawa aims to take the best from the existing models and create a new, multidisciplinary platform --the first of its kind in Canada. Our subscribers will fund and receive work from artists in the Ottawa region, and Ottawa artists will connect with new audiences. Just as participation in Community-Shared Agriculture provides healthy, local food and a greater understanding of the local farming process, participation in our CSArt season will provide exciting local works and a greater understanding of the process and individual artists.</p><p><br/></p><h3>Sharing is Caring</h3>We get that you can’t give to every cool crowd-funding thing that comes your way, no matter how good the perks. Sharing this campaign on your social media and with your friends is still a huge help to us. Let Ottawa know that a great new thing is coming its way!<p></p><p></p><p></p></div>","The model is simple: CSArt Ottawa curates a season of Ottawa-based artists; patrons purchase a subscription; the money is shared amongst the artists; the artists make original works for all of the subscribers; we throw a party about it.Want in?

<p>Our names are Ceylan Hulya and Lisa Rasmussen. We are two women on an Art Empowerment mission. In 2012 we co-founded and created an art organization, Art 4 All People LLC. With the idealism and passion to transform and heal individuals, communities, and the world through  art and its magical processes. Over this past four years it has happened ~we have transformed, served, and empowered people through Arts amazing healing processes. We developed a powerful new Art and Healing modality called YogART. At the heart of all of our healing arts (YogART) programming is a sense of empowering each individual to regain a sense of harmony, reverence, balance and to awaken inner resources for healing and creativity. We curated and created powerful Arts and Healing exhibitions. As well as written a book on creativity and compassion. In our heart and souls, we know that Art 4 All People is our higher calling and truly has the power to shift the paradigm to inclusivity and empowerment. But unfortunately, like many Transformative Art organizations are facing some challenges, as well as opportunities. </p>

<p><span style=""font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 30px;background-color: initial;"">About Us</span></p>
<p>We are the young artist collective from Bosnia and Herzegovina formed in
2015. Our artwork is based on a specific technique of the concept street art,
the wallcut as we call it. A synthesis of our initial commitments, but
professions as well, where members are an architect (Muhamed <b>H</b>amo Beslagic), a fine artist (<b>A</b>nel Lepic) and a street artist (<b>D</b>amir Sarac) led us to the creative
vision of making a new and unique artistic expression. After working day and
night and completing four large projects and exhibitions in 2015 (WALLS,
Silence, Yesterday.Today!Tomorrow? and Cut in a Wall), people got interested in
what we do worldwide.  The story of HAD was born from the urge to
make changes alone and as a collective, breaking the habits
of everyday social struggle. HAD breaks the walls they are surrounded
with, and the wallcut is the tool for breaking those walls and the individual
demons.</p>

<p>Our wallcut technique is
based on cutting and demolition of wall surfaces, where the relations between
the parts that remain and the removed parts create a relief surface of our
artwork. Our work is characterized by the fact that the wall becomes the
canvas, the masonry tools become the paint brush, and the wall impregnation
replaces the painting binder. While leaning on the traditional methods of
relief and sgraffito fresco techniques, but also traditional graphic techniques
we are going in a completely different direction thematically. </p>

Revolutionary
and selfless artistic expression, though distant from vandalism, possesses a

into representations of human figures and portraits.






Looking at the technical part of our artistic
expression, we use all kinds of hard surfaces, mainly walls. We scratch, carve and

Loss Machine was a hit in Portland, but we still need a big boost to ensure we can try something like this again...This Project
Risk/Reward is an emerging presenter and producer of innovative live performances in Portland, Oregon. This project is a big leap forward for us in scope and ambition. We're looking for help with Loss Machine, a gorgeous new evening length work by Seattle artist Kyle Loven to Portland. Part installation, part image-driven theater, this intimate one-man show
combines puppetry, objects, light,
sound, and original music in a visual exploration of loss and discovery.   It's an incredible work of art that our community deserves to experience.Your Donation

organization which organizes the exhibition ‘The Importance of Being …’,
 dedicated to the rich Belgian contemporary art world. It brings 40 of 
Belgium’s most prominent artists together. The exhibition will travel to
 four important museums in Latin America along one year and a half. 
Plural discourses and transversal approaches through a wide range of 
artistic supports make it possible to highlight nowadays crucial 
problematics worldwide in order to think on possible connections with 
other latitudes while mapping similarities and differences. The 
goal has been to go beyond the notion of Belgium. In this sense, 
subjects related to power and memory, to the binomial identity-alterity,
 conflicts and borders, human relations with both the technosphere and 
the biosphere in the context of the globalization are developed on the 
exhibition. Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes, Havana, Cuba: 13 Feb to 26 Apr 2015 Museo de Arte Contemporáneo, Buenos Aires, Argentina: 4 Jul to 12 Sep 2015 Museu de Arte Moderna, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: 2 Dec, 2015 to 14 Feb 2016

<p><strong>ABOUT THIS PROJECT</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong>What is This Crazy thing?!</strong></p>
<p>In short: SpliceUp is an exposure producing, and revenue generating machine for writers, musicians, and visual artists.</p>
<p>A SpliceUp is a new form of media, comprised of Visual Art, Story, and Music. Splicing Up is when an artist combines their work with the two different categories of media. The resulting artistic expression is a SpliceUp. The artist has added additional nuance by associating his/her work with complementary art. At its highest aspiration, Splice Ups will foster artist collaborations beyond the website</p>
<p><img alt=""A SpliceUp featured in the Musician's Gallery"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/013/541/a362696af748acd530ed0310bc68d85e_large.png?1338651795"" src="""" style="""" title=""Musician Splice Up""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We wanted to design this site as generously as possible, so we designed 3 different galleries. Each one gives special viewing incentives to make going to each individual gallery a rewarding experience.  When this goes live, you’ll get lost admiring art details in the gallery, listening to quality music, and reading beautiful stories without eye-fatigue!</p>
<p><strong>The Dream</strong></p>
<p>Your work might end up on someone else’s Facebook page, riding the back of an artist you’ve never met. A SpliceUp doesn't require explicit permission from the artists you choose to collaborate with, because you are effectively promoting their work while enhancing the appeal of your own. The site is designed to make Splicing Up an effortless, common endeavor with extraordinary results for everybody. Your work might be Spliced Up with a famous artist you admire, who you've just found out admires you, or it could conceivably land on the Ellen show and you and your compatriots will find the exposure you didn't dare dream of under the current anemic state of the publishing industry.  </p>
<p><strong>How is SpliceUp Unique?</strong></p>
<p>What makes SpliceUp so unique is what we aren't. We aren't competing with sites hocking raw media, like Deviant Art, Purevolume, and the hundreds of online publishers. Everything you submit is published (with the exception of very offensive work, and work that is not yours). Your exposure is determined by the quality of work rather than the vain and capricious nature of publishers. Good work will automatically find its way to the top, lauded by your fellow artists, rather than soulless publishers.</p>
<p><strong>Cool Features</strong></p>
<p>Once you've created a Splice Up, watch your work gain popularity with visual cues. Artists will ""level-up"" their frame to a more Louvre style after a certain number views, musicians can also see their record change from vinyl to gold and platinum, and writers get silver and gold foil award stamps! Side scrolling allows for viewers to anticipate the popularity of the upcoming work by seeing these special accolades.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>As you peruse the gallery of SpliceUps, you will be inspired, emboldened with a will to collaborate. Why must visual artists toil under corporate despots only to see their work launched disdainfully as artillery volleys between vying marketers, and talented musicians atrophy under the weight of radio playability, writers of clarity and insight become muddled as they try to speak the sullied tongue of Hollywood? SpliceUp is questing to defeat the soulless part of being an artist!</p>
<p>The site is free. We've included an ""experience bar"" on your profile that measures the traffic on your profile page, if you are receiving a lot of hits it might be more lucrative to upgrade to a premium account and allow for ad-click revenue. Or you can forego the extra revenue and choose to remove the ads from your profile.</p>
<p>Readability is important that's why the reader will be able to change settings for stories that they're reading--things like inverting white on black, black on white, and font settings. </p>
<p>Viewers will be able to look at art in full screen, to really admire the art.</p>
<p>SpliceUp also engages users with visual cues to track popularity and involvement within the SpliceUp community, all stored within your individual DNA strand. Think of it as your Splice Up portfolio.</p>

Seguramente conocerás mis perfiles de instagram y Facebook y estarás hart@ de verme en las competiciones de Jiujitsu brasileño. Quizá te sorprenda que esté organizando este proyecto puesto que siempre me has visto con una cámara encima y unos súper objetivos. Lo que quizá no sepas es que, cada vez que me has visto sacando fotos y grabando vídeos en las competiciones lo estaba haciendo alquilando el equipo por un coste muy elevado y sin obtener beneficios por mi trabajo, como mucho y si llegaba, cubriendo costes. Todo lo he hecho sólo porque comparto la misma pasión que tú, el Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. Hoy por hoy no puedo seguir asumiendo estos costes, y me es imposible realizar la inversión necesaria para adquirir el material profesional exigido para seguir cubriendo estos eventos. El material que debo comprar es una Canon Mark III y un objetivo Canon EF 70-200 f 2.8 L IS USM II. Este es el equipo que la mayoría de los fotógrafos profesionales utilizan para eventos deportivos. Además de una cámara compacta que ya he adquirido, y que estoy pagando a plazos. Tú sabes que en este deporte resulta muy dificil conseguir apoyo y patrocinios para los atletas, puedes imaginarte hasta que punto es imposible para un fotógrafo. A día de hoy estoy presente en la mayoría de las competiciones nacionales, visito todos los gimnasios que puedo en la geografía española e intento promocionar nuestro deporte, sus escuelas y atletas tanto como puedo. Hasta ahora siempre me he sentido acogido en cada escuela y gimnasio, todos y cada uno de vosotros me habéis hecho sentir parte de vuestra familia y siempre os he expresado mi gratitud con las mejores fotografías que he podido sacar en cada momento. Necesito tu ayuda, quiero mejorar la calidad de mi trabajo, pero sobre todo quiero causar un efecto en el mundo del BJJ, quiero promover nuestro deporte a nivel nacional e internacional. Con la fotografía conseguimos una mayor difusión del brazilian jiu jitsu, de sus atletas y de la comunidad. Una mayor difusión implica mejoras para el arte suave de nuestro país, más patrocinadores interesados y mejores condiciones. Si me has visto en las competiciones, sabes que soy el primero en llegar y el último en marcharme, pero cuando llego a casa el trabajo continúa, hay que editar y crear contenido nuevo a diario. Apoyar esta campaña es una manera de estimular y valorar mi trabajo para que pueda seguir creando recuerdos gratuitos de nuestras hazañas y vivencias en el BJJ. Risks and challenges Sé que es un proyecto ambicioso, sé que muchos no lo entenderán, pero tengo muchas ideas imposibles de llevar a cabo sin ayuda. Quiero mejorar el impacto del BJJ en España y en el mundo, y necesito de toda la colaboración posible, por muy pequeña sea, todos sumamos. ¡GRACIAS!</p><p><br/></p><p>Hi, I’m Agus, if you have landed here you probably know me as the photographer of GuardeirosBJJ. Perhaps you know my profiles on Instagram and Facebook, and you are most likely fed up of seeing me at every Brazilian Jiu Jitsu tournament. You might be surprised of finding me organizing this project because you have always seen me with a camera and some super nice lens. What you may not know is that every single time you saw me taking pictures and filming videos in tournaments, I was renting all the equipment for a really high cost, without having any benefits and, usually, without covering the costs of the renting and travels. Everything I did was because I share the same passion as you… BJJ. Nowadays I can’t keep assuming all those costs and it’s impossible for me to invest what it is necessary to acquire the professional material required to cover these events. The equipment I must acquire is a camera Canon Mark III + lens Canon EF 70-200 f 2.8 L IS USM II. This is the equipment that almost any professional photographer uses to take pictures at a sporting event; besides a compact camera that I have already bought and I am paying in installments. You know how difficult it is for an athlete to get support and sponsorships in this sport, you can imagine that for a photographer it’s just something impossible to achieve. At the moment I am taking pictures in almost every national tournament, I try to visit as much BJJ schools as I can all around the country, and I try to promote our sport, its academies and athletes as much as I can. I need your help, I want to improve the quality of my work but what I want the most, it’s to cause an effect in the BJJ world, I want to promote our sport nationally and internationally. Through photography we can reach more far-reaching for Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, its athletes and community. Widespreading implies improvements for the gentle art in our country, more sponsors interested and better conditions for everybody. If you have ever seen me in a tournament, you know that I am always the first one arriving and the last one leaving the place. But the truth is that my work still continues when I get home, I must keep editing and creating new and original content daily. To support this campaign is a way to estimulate and value my work, and, specially, it’s the only way I have to keep creating memories of our Bjj adventures for free. Risks and challenges I know that this is an ambitious project, I know that a lot of people won’t understand it, but I have a lot of ideas that are impossible to accomplish without your help. I want to improve the bounce of BJJ in Spain and the world and I need as much help as possible, every small contribution counts. Thank You!</p><br/></div>","Hola, Soy Agus, si has llegado hasta aquí, probablemente me conocerás como el fotógrafo de GuardeirosBJJ.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi, my name is Denny Hunter; I’m an art facilitator from Edinburgh in bonny Scotland. In my day job I help to present artwork for exhibitions and I’m also a professional picture framer. I work closely with conservators and curators to present art and history to a wide range of audiences.</p>
<p>I am also the creator of Artobotic and Brexit Art Machine which were set up to make the ownership of  art more accessible to the wider public via the use of vintage vending machines in public spaces. I garnered the support of Turner Prize nominated artists and Royal academicians such as Jake &amp; Dinos Chapman, David Mach and others such as Unskilled Worker and Kennard Philips.</p>
<p>I like to create conversations around art and our culture!</p>
<p>On my way back from work in the ancient heart of Edinburgh I pass the statue of Greyfriar’s Bobby sculpted by William Brodie in 1873 set on top of a water fountain all commissioned by a real life Mary Poppins who made magical things happen with her inherited fortune. Every year the statue’s nose is rubbed by millions of passing tourists for good luck but this is not an old tradition- The Bobbie’s nose started to be rubbed for luck around about 2011 (I blame Derron Brown!) and was repatinated in 2013 to protect the bronze below. People have continued to rub his nose and now his nose is very shiny which is not good! It means that the bare bronze of the 147 year old statue is exposed to the elements and could ‘pit’ and oxidise.</p>
<p>So... I’ve decided to do something about it- during our lockdown in Edinburgh I took a silicone impression of the Bobby’s nose and set about reproducing the nose using the ‘cold cast bronze’ method so that people could buy their own Bobby nose to rub wherever they are in the world with a view to paying for the repatination of the statues nose.<br/><br/><b>Framing </b></p>
<p>As a picture framer I know many of the best in the industry and so enlisted the services of Framework Picture Framers in Edinburgh to make the presentation cases within which the Bobby noses are mounted- Framework’s clients include Royalty, National galleries and private individuals such as JK Rowling so when we say that this product is high end that really is what you are getting, they have a quality of craftsmanship and attention to detail that is second to none.</p>
<p><b>Cold Cast Bronze</b></p>
<p>Cold cast bronze is a method of reproducing the look, approximate weight and tactile feel of hot cast bronze without the use of a foundry. It is made by mixing mostly genuine bronze powder with a resin binder which is trimmed and polished in the same way as it’s hot cast big brother with much the same effect. I myself will undertake the casting and finishing of these products so quality will be very important as I will be putting my name to it.</p>
<p><b>Presentation</b></p>
<p>Each Bobby nose case will come in a presentation box with a certificate of authenticity and information on the project. This aspect of the product is one that we still have to work through and you will be able to follow the progress as we design the logo and decide upon who should sign our certificates of authenticity.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><br/>We need the funds to make this happen! We need to pay for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Framing by Framework Picture Framers</li>
<li>Mountains of bronze powder</li>
<li>Resin</li>
<li>presentation boxes</li>
<li>Certificates of authenticity</li>
</ol>
<p><b>You Will Receive</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>A Limited Edition Large Cold Cast Bronze Bobby Nose In Obeche wood frame with Brown Mahogany finish by Framework Picture Framers.</li>
<li>A presentation box</li>
<li>Signed Certificate Of Authenticity</li>
<li>Information booklet explaining the story of these noses and the story of Greyfriars Bobby.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>
<br/>The Impact</h3>
<p><br/>When we reach 20 sales of the Large Limited Edition Bobby Noses we will allocate funds to pay for the repatination of Greyfriar’s Bobby’s nose.</p>
<p>By buying a Bobby Nose you are not only contributing directly to the conservation of a historic Scottish landmark but you are also buying into the concept of ‘<b>loyalty</b>’ which would make the Bobby nose a perfect gift for Christmas, weddings, anniversaries, birthdays and also corporate gifting.</p>
<p>I learned a lot about crowdfunding campaigns from the successfully funded Brexit Art Machine on Indiegogo and I love the priceless community that this builds around the idea. I intend to be as <b>loyal</b> to this community in this campaign as Bobby was to John Gray!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There will be hurdles to overcome during this campaign. One of these will be production of the bronze noses if there is a large demand- that is why I have already been focussing on this aspect by timing production and opening up channels for help if required.</p>
<p>I am already a skilled craftsman with many connections in this field, my wife is an inventor and has taken many products from concept to full scale manufacture and distribution.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p><br/>You don’t need to make a purchase to help out and be part of our story...<br/>So please spread the word by sharing this campaign on social media!</p>

<p><i><strong>To any burn,</strong></i> <i><strong>anywhere, every camp brings a little something. </strong></i>Towering wooden artworks to burn, wild spontaneous performances in the dust, or even just a small, personal gift made with care and spare time. Our camp, the way we want to chip in, is a Mutant Vehicle camp, which - for those who haven’t had the chance to attend – is Afrikaburn speak for a moving art-piece, a motorised marvel, a performance on wheels! This is how we want to give back.: We want to make an Oasis in the desert.</p>
<h3>A floating Island... Why?</h3>
<p>Island fun in desert of course! Here’s the dream: Imagine climbing aboard a lush, breezy island, drinking ice cold drinks from a coconut, relaxing (or maybe something a little more energetic) in the shade and enjoying the most impossible island vibes surrounded by the dust! </p>
<p>Well that sounded amazing to us, and so we are now passionately working towards turning that amazing paradisiac experience of our imaginations into an all-singing, all-driving levitating machine jungle! </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539351442/uaexza2rgtesxiunivhe.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Who are we, you ask?</h3>
<p>We are a mix of South African and international creatives based primarily in Cape Town, but spread across six countries around the world.</p>
<p>We are burners for life and we’ve got epic artworks, extravagant mutant vehicles, and wonderful gifts under our belts over the last seven years (oh my god has it been seven years??) we’ve now been returning home to Afrikaburn. This project is in the experienced hands of a little collection of people who care deeply about the burn, and would love to work with you to give it that extra tropical twist this year!</p>
<p>We ain’t shy... if you want to know more, all you have to do is ask!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539351749/yocgiylb891qnrvw2fmo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>So what exactly is O-Hey-Sis!...</h3>
<p>Well firstly… It’ll… Well. It will be built upon a 3.5 ton truck. Yes you heard that right! A steel substructure will be built over the existing chassis which will provide support the wooden platform, out of which soaring palm trees will rise and in turn supporting the upper decks. But HEY!.. you don't care how we make it right? You just want us to do it already! (subject to all mandatory health and safety checks of course)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539352384/dtxqj9jz1fczjsfqmqfm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>O-Hey-Sis! will also be more than a rolling Oasis in the desert (which I think we’d already be cool with to be honest). It will have misters to spray cool water over its dwellers. It will have flamethrowers coming out of the top of the palm trees at night. No matter the weather, the O-Hey-Sis! has got you covered.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539352053/sj934tb5gfjca6eln3mb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>And you know it’s not a party without a signature drink - and we will be brewing our very own mystical beverage just for our comfortable guests... We will call it the O-Hey-Sis-Bru! QUIVER BEFORE ITS PERCENTAGE ALCOHOL CONTENT!!</p>
<p>Of course, we all love a little (read: constant) music in our lives and so we are setting our goals high. We are aiming to get a great sound system we can set up onboard and blow some minds at night with tropical music classics in the desert. If you are a DJ and are keen to DJ... or have a sound system *hint hint, nudge nudge* then please get in touch. Aside from our infinite gratefulness and love – campmate Keir will imprint emotionally on you and essentially do your every bidding. Treat him kindly you silver-eared devil. What is needed...</p>
<h3>What is needed?</h3>
<p>Well... What isn't... We have applied for an art grant from Afrikaburn through which we are sure to get some bucks. The diverse group of broke people you saw above are lifting those couch cushions and checking all jean pockets before they go into the wash for every cent in the hopes of contributing $600 toward our tropical dream. As much as we wish we could reach our target all by our lonesome, the reality is simply that we’re going to need a bit more help.</p>
<p>Our grand total to make this project a reality is $5,200 which leaves an additional $4,600 that needs to be raised for our [and hopefully your] floating jungle to become a reality.</p>
<p><strong>Where is your contribution going?</strong></p>
<p>The main costs and bulk of our budget will be going towards:</p>
<p>- buying the 3.5 ton vehicle and doing the necessary modifications and repairs to the vehicle</p>
<p>- buying all the wood for the various platforms, railings, structure, trees, etc</p>
<p>- buying all the steel which forms a large part of substructure and strength</p>
<p>Besides the large costs, there are many smaller costs often overlooked. These include things such as bolts, screws, fabric, paint, varnish, cutting discs, sandpaper, grinding discs, welding rods, and many others.</p>
<p>Of course then there is the question... where and do we make this? To make it we need the use of a workshop, tools, storage and all of those additionals. </p>
<h3>Want to help but can't splurge right now?</h3>
<p>Firstly if you haven't already you can share our campaign far and wide to help us reach those far reaching places...</p>
<p>- If you are in Cape Town and have materials, decor or anything island and tropical please get in touch and we will gladly relieve you of your unwanted items.</p>
<p>- Live in Cape Town and keen to get involved? Help with the actual build is definitely welcome. Or if you have no clue what a no.6 spanner is and just want a good chat while drinking beer and watching other people work... Well that can be arranged too!</p>
<p>- If you have contacts for sound equipment or DJ's then please, put them in contact with us. We welcome all suggestions and ideas.</p>

Besides the large costs, there are many smaller costs often overlooked. These include things such as bolts, screws, fabric, paint, varnish, cutting discs, sandpaper, grinding discs, welding rods, and many others.
Of course then there is the question... where and do we make this? To make it we need the use of a workshop, tools, storage and all of those additionals. 
Want to help but can't splurge right now?
Firstly if you haven't already you can share our campaign far and wide to help us reach those far reaching places...
- If you are in Cape Town and have materials, decor or anything island and tropical please get in touch and we will gladly relieve you of your unwanted items.
- Live in Cape Town and keen to get involved? Help with the actual build is definitely welcome. Or if you have no clue what a no.6 spanner is and just want a good chat while drinking beer and watching other people work... Well that can be arranged too!
- If you have contacts for sound equipment or DJ's then please, put them in contact with us. We welcome all suggestions and ideas.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>On November 9, 2019, we will celebrate our 7th annual Firelight Lantern Festival, a magical event which has become a much-loved community tradition. Hundreds of people meet in Benson Park clutching their homemade lanterns; together we parade down Main Street to the Crystal Palace, where we're delighted by live music, performances, and art installations. In the weeks prior to the festival we are offering FREE lantern-making workshops as well as a costuming workshop to help you get festival-ready!</p>
<p>Despite our brilliant track record of bringing high-quality accessible arts programming to our community, we were not awarded one of our grants this year; it's a tough time to be a non-profit organization in this province.

<p>Please consider making a donation today - it takes a village to raise a festival!</p>

<h3>An Unlikely Evolution</h3>
<p>The name Nonsensico originated around 5 years ago. At first, it was used to describe an obscure line of buttons (sold out of a gumball machine) that featured visual non sequiturs that I found amusing. Perfect Toast, Tiny Monkey, Foot In Space, etc. An edition of 200 or so was produced for each, and when they sold out it was on to the next one. It was (and continues to be) so amusing.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1580662179/im8xi95scijlqu83aaqx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Over the years, the Nonsensico name was also used to describe a bunch weird stuff I was making that didn't fit anywhere. Sort of an incubator for misfit ideas. An obsession with tiny traffic cones, some photos of painted rubber feet in front of furry backgrounds, a Cheese Cult, fuzzy buttons, etc. Again, so very amusing.</p>

<p>All of this leads up to a couple months ago, when I was photographed in front of a wall full of unusual objects, and for some reason a fake magazine cover with the Nonsensico name was designed. Well, one cover was not enough, and a couple more popped into existence. The amusement continued, and <strong>it normally would have ended there...</strong></p>

<p>A close friend and conspirator then declared he wanted to see what this magazine actually looked like, and so the game was afoot. That is when the concept pivoted a bit--instead of a magazine filled with my random nonsense, I decided (with inspiration from several folks) to make it a bona fide, carefully curated publication filled mostly with other artists and their excellently crafted nonsense. Sometimes playful, sometimes brutal, some pop, some abstract, and almost always not easy to comprehend and very subjective. <strong>Really, it should have ended there</strong>, but EVERYONE I wanted to feature said yes without reservation. It was touching for so many people to trust me with their weird babies, and it gave me motivation to keep things rolling along.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Black Magic is a project created and curated by a black female artist in response to the overwhelming lack of black female and non binary representation in the fantasy genre. Very rarely are there black characters in fantastical pieces of media and if there are, they are usually a token secondary character and almost never the main characters of the story.<br/><br/>Black Magic has given artists an opportunity to explore the idea of having black characters be the focus in fantasy. In this book, black girls and non binary people are depicted as everything from knights, to fairies,  goddesses,  monster hunters, vampires, and tons more!<br/><br/>Spreading word and backing this project will help us share the message that there is a demand for diversity and poc representation in fantasy. Additionally, if this project is successfully funded, this will be a great opportunity for our contributing artists to gain exposure and recognition for their talent.<br/><br/>Though the main focus of this project is to promote black visibility in fantasy and to gain exposure for our contributing artists, this project also serves as an opportunity to donate to Flint, Michigan as there is still a need for aid and supplies for those who are still without clean water. After printing and shipping costs for the books and promised perk merchandise, all proceeds will be donated to the United Way of Genesee County's Flint Water Fund by Black Magic's curator and creator, Jazmine Boatman.<br/><br/><i><strong>***Please note that this project is NOT in any way affiliated with the United Way of Genesee County or any other Flint relief effort.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Short Summary</p>
<p>About Me: I hold a Masters in Art Education from the Mass College of Art and Design, and a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Tufts University and the Museum School of Fine Arts. I am the owner and designer for the company B. Felt. I design and manufacture by hand, beautiful felted garments and accessories. My work can be seen in galleries and museum shops around the nation and internationally. My work and show schedule can be viewed on my web site, <a href=""http://www.bfelt.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.bfelt.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Veils Part 2.</strong> I want to thank everyone who has contributed thus far to helping to bring back the Veils to Lowell, MA.  The money that was raised has been put to good use. I have been able to hire professionals to repair the Veils and they are doing an AMAZING job. Here is a link to Part 1 <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/veils-of-color-for-lowell-venice-of-america-art--2/x/3562892#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/veils-of-col...</a> </p>
<p>I would like to give a shout out to all who have contributed to date with either money, time or both: Jane Pratt, Suzanne Bacon, M.J.Bujold, A M Katz , Richard Juknavorian, Anna Comella, Bettina Donaghy, Kelli Knack, Mary Walker, Ann Conlin, Pat McSweeney, Kathleen Bryson, Judy Narosny, Susan Blook, Paige Gayuski, Betsy Disharoon, Ellie Ramsey, and Carol Hochburg. Your support means so much to me.</p>
<p>I have been given two grants one from the Lowel Cultural Council distributed from the Massachusetts Cultural Council and I was awarded the UMass Govenors 2020 Challenge grant and just today I am also happy to report that Enterprise Bank has come through with a donation to help bring the monies I need to raise down to 2000.  THANK YOU Enterprise! There is still a ways to go, and not being a professional fund raiser and not overly tech savvy, I admit to failing to push and follow up on the campaign in a timely matter.</p>
<p>History: As the National Park boat leaves the Swamp Locks, it enters the lower Pawtucket Canal, heading into the Industrial Canyon. In 1890, if you entered this part of the canal, the crescendos of hundreds of shuttles flying back and forth on the looms would have been deafening. Now, the only sounds are from the outboard motors of the National Park’s Canal boat and the occasional quack of the ducks. Today the mills are filled with artists, entrepreneurs, established businesses, restaurants, condominiums, and apartments. As the canal boat eases through the locks, the building on the right is nothing more than architectural remnants. A ghostly facade of windows belonging to the Dye House was once a two story building and part of the Appleton Mills. It is from these windows that these dyes were unceremoniously dumped into the canals. Some days it would be a red canal, and some days it would be a yellow canal, while other days it would just look like mud.</p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
<p>I am planning on raising $4,500 for this campaign. So far I have raised $2500. With part 2 I hope to raise the rest of the monies. Contributing to this campaign will help me achieve multiple important steps in the re-installing of this piece, including but not limited to: repairing last seasons veils and creating new ones if needed, hiring an engineer to help me with the thermodynamics of the canal and installing the veils without damaging the historic building or the veils and without injury to me or to anyone else involved, </p>
<p>The perks you will obtain if you contribute to this campaign are as followed;</p>
<p>$5 Postcard </p>
<p>$15 Postcard and stickers</p>
<p>$30 T-shirt</p>
<p>$50 Postcard and a mug</p>
<p>$75 A tote bag</p>
<p>$150 a mug and a tote bag</p>
<p>$250 a mug tote bag and a t-shirt</p>
<p>$500 a t-shirt and tickets for the canal tour</p>
<p>$1000 Lunch with me in my loft and a personalized tour for 10 people of the canal</p>
<p>All of the merchandise given with the perks will be adorned with an abstract graphic of the veils. The postcard will have a photo of the veils from last season's installation.</p>
<p>This installation will be happening whether I meet my goal or not. If I do not reach my goal, I will be forced to pull back on the installation.</p>
<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>After having done this installation before I am prepared to face the risks I faced last year, and I will be more equipped this time around. I am going to be hiring an engineer to help me with a lot of the challenges I faced, including dealing with the thermodynamics of the canal, figuring out the best solution for installing the veils on the building without damaging it as it is historic, and overcoming the 30 feet high installation on unsteady ground. Having an engineer will make the installation process go much smoother than it had in the past, therefore making me very well prepared.</p>

Short Summary
About Me: I hold a Masters in Art Education from the Mass College of Art and Design, and a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Tufts University and the Museum School of Fine Arts. I am the owner and designer for the company B. Felt. I design and manufacture by hand, beautiful felted garments and accessories. My work can be seen in galleries and museum shops around the nation and internationally. My work and show schedule can be viewed on my web site, www.bfelt.com.
Veils Part 2. I want to thank everyone who has contributed thus far to helping to bring back the Veils to Lowell, MA.  The money that was raised has been put to good use. I have been able to hire professionals to repair the Veils and they are doing an AMAZING job. Here is a link to Part 1 https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/veils-of-col... 
I would like to give a shout out to all who have contributed to date with either money, time or both: Jane Pratt, Suzanne Bacon, M.J.Bujold, A M Katz , Richard Juknavorian, Anna Comella, Bettina Donaghy, Kelli Knack, Mary Walker, Ann Conlin, Pat McSweeney, Kathleen Bryson, Judy Narosny, Susan Blook, Paige Gayuski, Betsy Disharoon, Ellie Ramsey, and Carol Hochburg. Your support means so much to me.
I have been given two grants one from the Lowel Cultural Council distributed from the Massachusetts Cultural Council and I was awarded the UMass Govenors 2020 Challenge grant and just today I am also happy to report that Enterprise Bank has come through with a donation to help bring the monies I need to raise down to 2000.  THANK YOU Enterprise! There is still a ways to go, and not being a professional fund raiser and not overly tech savvy, I admit to failing to push and follow up on the campaign in a timely matter.
History: As the National Park boat leaves the Swamp Locks, it enters the lower Pawtucket Canal, heading into the Industrial Canyon. In 1890, if you entered this part of the canal, the crescendos of hundreds of shuttles flying back and forth on the looms would have been deafening. Now, the only sounds are from the outboard motors of the National Park’s Canal boat and the occasional quack of the ducks. Today the mills are filled with artists, entrepreneurs, established businesses, restaurants, condominiums, and apartments. As the canal boat eases through the locks, the building on the right is nothing more than architectural remnants. A ghostly facade of windows belonging to the Dye House was once a two story building and part of the Appleton Mills. It is from these windows that these dyes were unceremoniously dumped into the canals. Some days it would be a red canal, and some days it would be a yellow canal, while other days it would just look like mud.
What We Need & What You Get
I am planning on raising $4,500 for this campaign. So far I have raised $2500. With part 2 I hope to raise the rest of the monies. Contributing to this campaign will help me achieve multiple important steps in the re-installing of this piece, including but not limited to: repairing last seasons veils and creating new ones if needed, hiring an engineer to help me with the thermodynamics of the canal and installing the veils without damaging the historic building or the veils and without injury to me or to anyone else involved, 
The perks you will obtain if you contribute to this campaign are as followed;
$5 Postcard 
$15 Postcard and stickers
$30 T-shirt
$50 Postcard and a mug
$75 A tote bag
$150 a mug and a tote bag
$250 a mug tote bag and a t-shirt
$500 a t-shirt and tickets for the canal tour
$1000 Lunch with me in my loft and a personalized tour for 10 people of the canal
All of the merchandise given with the perks will be adorned with an abstract graphic of the veils. The postcard will have a photo of the veils from last season's installation.
This installation will be happening whether I meet my goal or not. If I do not reach my goal, I will be forced to pull back on the installation.
Risks & Challenges
After having done this installation before I am prepared to face the risks I faced last year, and I will be more equipped this time around. I am going to be hiring an engineer to help me with a lot of the challenges I faced, including dealing with the thermodynamics of the canal, figuring out the best solution for installing the veils on the building without damaging it as it is historic, and overcoming the 30 feet high installation on unsteady ground. Having an engineer will make the installation process go much smoother than it had in the past, therefore making me very well prepared.

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is <a href=""https://tatyanaostapenko.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tatyana Ostapenko</a>. I am a contemporary visual artist and I create history paintings that record the daily lives of people who usually don’t make it into official historical records. I use images from my native Ukraine to speak about universal human experiences and evoke empathy and hope in the face of adversity.</p>
<p>It’s been my dream for a long time now to paint a mural. I finally get to create a piece of public art and now you can be a part of making this dream become reality.</p>
<p>In the past year I have been working on an increasingly larger scale, creating life sized figurative paintings of older women from my native Ukraine. And now I get to bring my beloved babushkas out to a public space. </p>
<p>This mural is a part of the Ladies Up initiative by the Portland Street Art Alliance, a small local non-profit organization.  PSAA has extended an opportunity to five local female-identifying artists to create murals in SE Portland's Buckman Neighborhood at SE Morrison and 14th Ave. I got one of the larger walls in the project, a whopping 10x18 footer. I can’t wait to paint my babushkas so they can sternly stare at the Portland passerby from this expanse!</p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>For this campaign I am asking to raise $2500. This covers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>fair wages for hiring a fellow artist to assist with logistics, transportation and on site assistance during the painting of the mural  </p></li>
<li><p>the cost of fulfilling all the amazing rewards you crowd-funders will get to enjoy by contributing to our campaign</p></li>
<li><p>creative time for designing and painting the mural</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br/>The Portland Street Art Alliance is providing participating artists with a materials stipend of $750 which helps to cover paint, supplies and other material expenses. However, at this scope of project, I will need help. I will be hiring an assistant with a vehicle to transport paints, ladders, and other sundry to and from the location, as well as help me with wall preparation, roughing in the design, and generally keeping me sane and well-hydrated.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The project is going to take a week from start to completion and I want to pay my assistant a fair wage. And as I am volunteering many more hours for preparation and design, as well as physical execution of the mural, I would greatly appreciate any and all contributions to compensate for my creative time and effort for producing this piece of public art in the midst of the pandemic. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>To reach my fundraising campaign goal of $2500 I am offering available paintings that served as inspiration for this mural as contribution perks. They are all images of strong, resilient and much underappreciated older women. I don’t consider them portraits of particular individuals; they are collective images, archetypes, embodiments of the indomitable spirit of all of our mothers and grandmothers who withstood adversity and weathered many storms with dignity and without much praise or acknowledgement.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The original painting that I created as a mock up for this mural is available as one of the campaign perks. Own a piece of soon to be Portland history! The mural will be on that wall for 3 years, but you can keep the original scale model design forever.<br/><br/>This painting that serves as the mural design measures 24x36 inches. It is painted in acrylic on canvas.  It is yours when you generously contribute to this campaign at the $999 level. </p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1589829243/cjgqnurbbppopdyjjjfo.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I will also make this painting available as high quality art prints in a limited edition of 25.</p>
<p>Each print will be hand numbered and signed and available as a perk for contributions of $35.<br/><br/>Even if I don't reach my campaign goal, all available funds will be applied toward fulfilling all perks, and paying my assistant first, with any remainder going toward my artist fees.</p>

<h3>About the Artist </h3>
</div><div>
<p> </p>
<p>I was born in the Soviet Union, and lived half of my life in the US.  Even though I have always wanted to be an artist, I took time to allow myself this luxury.</p>
<p>I worked as a stock trader, car auction buyer, bartender and Russian-English interpreter before going back to school for art. And it's been only a year since I've been a full time artist.</p>
<p>I have exhibited my work at international art fairs and museums in South Korea, Ukraine and the United States. Along the way, I’ve been fortunate enough to sell to private and corporate collectors and governmental institutions alike.<br/><br/>Dear parents, don’t be afraid of letting your kids go to art school! My first degree was in business and I carried pretty much no practical and applicable skills into the world from it. Art school taught me executive level problem solving and a can-do attitude that empowered me to tackle projects from designing and installing custom flooring in my house to teaching myself tech and marketing skills. The main thing that art school teaches nowadays are creative problem solving skills and ability to approach challenges with a can do attitude. Now, these are serious transferable skill applicable in life and business for sure! </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The vast majority of the images of women we see tend to be the same: young, slender, conforming to particular commercial ideas and ideals of beauty and femininity. In my paintings, and now on a large scale public mural, I show women that are strong and resilient, who stand tall and whose primary concern isn't the smooth perfection of their looks. We need more diverse representation of women in our environments. Age isn’t something to hide and apologize for. These babushkas will remind the passerby of that!</p>

<h2>2017 Kalham Sutra Calendar</h2>
<h3>Indian Goddess, Nude Fine Art </h3>
<p>The calendar Kalham Sutra will feature stunning topless nude art photos of Indian Goddess Kalham Amor in nature by Sean Pozin of Gypsy Vibes Art. We estimate that production, marketing &amp; photoshoot travel expenses will cost around $2,000 so we need your help to make our dream come true by backing the 2017 Kalham Sutra calendar campaign! </p>
<p>Kalham Sutra is inspired by the Sanskrit Kama Sutra which is an ancient guide to love, sensuous &amp; sensual pleasure. Kalham Sutra touches on an aspect of Indian culture that is practically ignored in this century, which is art with sensual tones that embraces the body for what it is in its natural state. The book will make more people realize that the world of photography and modeling is more about creating art that is centered around larger issues than just taking sexy photographs. </p>

<h3>About Kalham Amor</h3>
<p>Kalham Amor is a glamour model of Indian descent based in Dallas, TX. Kalham always had a dream to model and is one of the very few open-minded glamour models of Indian descent who also comes from a conservative background. Kalham is a gorgeous model who has been published in many magazines &amp; she also wrote her first book ""The Book of Amor"" at the age of 21. </p>

<h3>About Sean Pozin</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.instagram.com/gypsyvibesart"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.Instagram.com/GypsyVibesArt</a></p>
<p>Sean Pozin is a rising star in the nude art photography world &amp; has been involved in the arts for over 10 years from oil painting, photography, graphic design, art gallery installations to ceramics on the wheel. Sean only recently picked up a camera 14 months ago &amp; is driven by passion to create beautiful nude art in nature that connects with the soul. As a photographer Sean strives to capture a models emotions, spark the creative spirit &amp; showcase the beauty of mother nature.</p>
<p>""Love, consciousness, and creativity are the highest refinements of the cosmic evolutionary force."" ~ Alex Grey</p>
<h3>Where Will Funds Go?</h3>
<p>Travel expenses: since Kalham is based in Dallas, TX, she will have to travel to Florida to create the photographs and she will also need a place to stay. This alone should cost about $600 to pay for flight tickets and a hotel room.</p>
<p>Designing, printing, and shipping costs: after the project is finished, all of the books will have to be designed, printed, and shipped to the contributors. High quality printing and shipping are not cheap so it should cost at least $600, if not more, to get all of the books to the contributors in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>Each and every contribution is valuable to us because without your support, none of this would be possible. To reward contributors, each contributor will receive an exclusive reward. </p>
<h3>Why Your Contribution Matters?</h3>
<p>By contributing to this campaign you will be able to help Sean Pozin &amp; Kalham Amor break the stereotype that people place on Indian culture plus create awareness about Indian mythological art. Kalham Sutra will help more people all over the world realize that there are women of Indian descent such as Kalham Amor who fully understand the meaning of the phrase ""my body, my choice"" and that clothes, or lack thereof, do not define a woman.</p>

<p><b>About Unísono Festival</b></p>
<p>Unísono is a FREE fiesta that celebrates art,
music, diversity and community engagement in Chicago's Historic and Unique Pilsen neighborhood. Unísono, Spanish for <i>unison,

festival because it combines food, dance, music and art with social causes. </p><p>
</p><p>More than a street festival, more than a
community fair, Unísono 2014 will showcase local, national and international
chefs, artists and musicians. Each festival has a social justice theme
and Unísono 2014 will focus on health and wellness. </p>
<p>Unísono has invited dancers, nutritionists,
yogis, acupuncturists, healers, doctors, trainers and other experts to teach
and share. Unisono 2014 brings workshops, instruction, yoga (ALL day!) and

them to unite with great food and music. In past years Unísono has featured Grammy
award winning groups like Sones de Mexico and Grupo Fantasma and cutting edge
Chicago indi rockers. Traditional Mexican folk artists shared the stage with
dub step dj’s. And it works beautifully. <br/></p>
<p>As important as the terrific
musical line up is the community engagement that happens at Unísono. Each year’s
event has a social justice theme that brings educators, thinkers and doers to

<p>Project Dispatch is a mail order artwork
subscription service that was started in 2009 with the idea of creating a space
for artists to get exposure and sell their work, as well as a place for
collectors to begin acquiring artwork and engaging directly with the artists
they are collecting.</p>
<p>Our subscriptions range from $30 per month to
$90 per month, customizable for durations of 3, 6, or 12 months. We currently
have 23 artist members, and subscribers can receive original artwork from the
artist of their choice each month, or be surprised by a new artist with each
installment. These works are shipped directly from
the artist's studio to your door! </p>
<p>One of the most important aspects of Project Dispatch is to provide an affordable option for collecting art. BUT we also need to make sure
that it sustains the artists involved. Project Dispatch only takes 25% of art
sales, paying 75% of our revenue to artists. This leaves very little for our
operating expenses, but we believe that artists should get paid for their art
above all else. </p>
<p>We are already interacting with a
variety of retail venues and galleries, but we need to take it to the next
level with promotion and advertising to reach a broader base of new collectors.
We have big plans for a marketing strategy with Hyperallergic Media and PRX
that will encourage revenue that will sustain and grow and business. </p>
<p>Please help us, so that we can continue
to bring you artwork in the form of monthly subscriptions and connect you with
the local artists whose careers you are helping form!  </p>
<h3>WHAT WE NEED</h3>
<p>Our goal for this project is to raise
$11,000 to cover the costs of design for our online advertising campaign, radio
sponsorships with podcasts on art, design, and cultural interest, as well as
payment to artists, shipping, and production costs for the awesome perks that we
are offering as a thank you for your support. These perks include original artwork,
opportunities to meet with artists one on one in their studios, opportunities to select works
from our flat file for your personal collection, tote bags, private parties and
more!</p>

The distro grew in size from a shoe box to a suitcase, and I went from tabling at punk shows in my basement to zine fests in major cities. It's been awesome connecting with writers and artists and helped them distribute their work through a non-capitalistic channel. Plus, more and more members of the community in New Brunswick have become engaged in self-publishing and showcasing independent artists and I hope that will continue. Print is a ""dying medium"" but this is way more than just getting people to read books. Self-publishing is defiant, and reading zines is radical.</span></p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">2015 was a big year for LFBC. I tabled at Paper Jam at the Silent Barn in NYC, RIPExpo in Providence RI, Zine Feast at SUNY Purchase, Boston Zine Fest, local shows, poetry readings, and arts&amp;crafts fairs. Three issues of LFBC were <a href=""issuu.com/bunkmate"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">released </a>this year AND we celebrated the distro's one year anniversary. Released the distro's first <a href=""https://lettersfrombummercamp.bandcamp.com/album/the-hits-vol-1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">compilation </a>of music, with which we raised money to fund the Reformed Church of Highland Park's initiatives to help house families of Syrian refugees.</span></p>

<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Conduct more fundraisers, but be able to reach more people with the right resources- for example, the compilation was released digitally on bandcamp, and I hope to eventually release tapes. In 2014 by selling and mailing old leftover zines to people all over the country, we raised money to go towards the Ferguson Public Library, which at the time was serving as a community space for children whose schools were closed. I would love to take on more projects like that at a greater magnitude.</span></li>

</div></div>","Help LFBC spread self-published writing and independent art made by underrepresented voices  My name is Alyssa, and I started the Letters From Bummer Camp Press & Distro in the summer of 2014 to help my peers distribute zines and other self-published work. The distro grew in size from a shoe box to a suitcase, and I went from tabling at punk shows in my basement to zine fests in major cities. It's been awesome connecting with writers and artists and helped them distribute their work through a non-capitalistic channel. Plus, more and more members of the community in New Brunswick have become engaged in self-publishing and showcasing independent artists and I hope that will continue. Print is a ""dying medium"" but this is way more than just getting people to read books. Self-publishing is defiant, and reading zines is radical.

2015 was a big year for LFBC. I tabled at Paper Jam at the Silent Barn in NYC, RIPExpo in Providence RI, Zine Feast at SUNY Purchase, Boston Zine Fest, local shows, poetry readings, and arts&crafts fairs. Three issues of LFBC were released this year AND we celebrated the distro's one year anniversary. Released the distro's first compilation of music, with which we raised money to fund the Reformed Church of Highland Park's initiatives to help house families of Syrian refugees.
This campaign was created to help achieve my goals for LFBC in 2016:


Conduct more fundraisers, but be able to reach more people with the right resources- for example, the compilation was released digitally on bandcamp, and I hope to eventually release tapes. In 2014 by selling and mailing old leftover zines to people all over the country, we raised money to go towards the Ferguson Public Library, which at the time was serving as a community space for children whose schools were closed. I would love to take on more projects like that at a greater magnitude.
Attend two zine fests that are not on the east coast, specifically LA and Omaha, to engage with other zinesters and community organizers living in different types of areas.
Turn LFBC into a subscription-based send-away mail service
Build a real website for the distro in order to present the project in a clear way on the internet and anyone who might be interested in participating in contributing. Right now I rely on only the Facebook  and Tumblr pages to reach people and have people get in touch.

Why should The Woodlands Mansion and Carriage House be restored? 


Every
     aspect of The Woodlands (mansion, carriage house, and grounds) is historically
     significant to the nation,
     not just to Philadelphia. This project will restore them to the grandeur
     of Alma’s day. 
There
     are more people using The Woodlands today than ever before, and they are
     using it in many more ways. It is a place of true exploration, discovery and inspiration. 
Once
     the mansion and carriage house are restored, they will house classrooms, workshop
     space, and allow more people to access this amazing place.  




  

What are the steps involved in restoration? 
Mansion

Wood and Window Conservation
Painting
Iron railing restoration
Portico stone pavers and lighting


Carriage House 

Wood and Window Conservation
Masonry Repairs
Electrical service and exterior lighting



The full restoration cost of both buildings will be $830,400.
The William B. Dietrich Foundation has pledged $612,000 to
restore the mansion if The Woodlands can raise an additional $218,400 to restore the carriage house. We have to raise this money by January 31, 2015 in order to get the funds. With your help, we can restore these treasures!

<p><b>Camera’s for kids </b>is just one component of the brand new
arts program, <b>Focus of a Child</b> that will be kicking off in October 2016 in
Kolkata India.  Research has found
that regardless of culture, social status or economic well being, when children
are exposed to the arts they stay in school longer, their communication skills
accelerate, and their self worth/value skyrockets.  The list actually goes on with over 100 benefits from
exposure to the arts.</p>
<p>Focus of a Child will be bringing the art of photography to
<b>two groups of students </b>in Howrah India, a slum area on the outskirts of
downtown Kolkata.  Three
internationally acclaimed photographers will be teaching students not just the
technical side of photography but they will allow the students to discover the
true art of photography.  Soon the
students will begin to see their world through a new lens. One that will <b>spark
creativity, joy and give them a new source of communication.</b></p>
<p>The initial roll out of the Focus of a Child program will
include two groups of children. The first will be a group of 25 students
attending HB school in Howrah that will <b>consist of children, mostly females
ranging from 12-15</b>.  This is a true
make it or break it time in an Indian child’s life.  Being involved in the arts can be a major catalyst to a
child “making it” Our second group of children consists of <b>6 daughters of
parents who currently are working in the commercial sex trade industry</b>.  These girls are at a critical tipping
point in their life.  Gaining new
skills, self confidence and pride for their family can give them the
opportunity to break the family cycle of being a prisoner in the life crushing
sex trade industry.</p>
<p> <b>A camera WILL
make a difference. YOU can make a difference</b>.  We need your help to impact a student by providing support
in obtaining the cameras needed for each student.  Your donation will give each student the opportunity to have
a personal camera that they can use during the program.  If we make our goal the students will
be able to bring home their camera and tell THEIR story through the images they
will capture each evening and will not need to share the camera with other
students.   </p>
</div><div>
<p>You have the opportunity to <b>put a camera into the hands
of a child.</b> Your gift, your thoughtful gesture, can

Last year I decided to take control of the marketing of my work. I made the commitment to selling my art at outdoor markets.  It went pretty well.  I learned a lot about selling my work and new, more affordable types of art products I could create and offer.  I also learned that I needed to do a lot more art fairs in different locations.<br/><br/>But as with all businesses, there are a lot of up-front costs involved with participating in the art market scene.  From jury fees, to artists association fees, to business licenses for each town, to booth fees, to gas, to food and lodging – it mounts up quickly.<br/><br/>That's where you come in.  With this indiegogo campaign I'm hoping to raise at least $1500 to help with these upfront costs.  In the past artists looked to wealthy patrons for support.  I find these times of crowdsourcing and social networking so exciting as it opens up the world of patronage to regular working folks. As a supporter you become like a modern-day Medici, helping an artist (me) continue to create and share my work with the world.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But why would you want to support my work.  Well, In this crazy world I continue to believe in the power of beauty and love to transform.   I guess that's why I keep on doing what I do.  It is my hope that my art contributes to this energy, and supports and expresses a world view, based on harmony, love, cooperation and interconnectedness.  <br/><br/>What do you get in return for your support.  Just look to the right of my project page and you'll see the different levels of support and all the different art products available for each level.  From greeting cards, to miniature canvasses, to little hand-painted boxes, to my journal for your own creative work, to giclee prints, original art, and commissioned work there are many options from which to choose.<br/><br/>I would be so very grateful for any and all support you can offer.  Even if you can't offer monetary support at this time, it would be wonderful if you could pass the word on to your friends about my campaign.  Thanks a lot and maybe I'll see you at one of the markets.</div>

</div></div>","I'm seeking your support to take my mobile art show to the next level.  I've been a painter my whole life, in and out of galleries, and always improving my work. Last year I decided to take control of the marketing of my work. I made the commitment to selling my art at outdoor markets.  It went pretty well.  I learned a lot about selling my work and new, more affordable types of art products I could create and offer.  I also learned that I needed to do a lot more art fairs in different locations.But as with all businesses, there are a lot of up-front costs involved with participating in the art market scene.  From jury fees, to artists association fees, to business licenses for each town, to booth fees, to gas, to food and lodging – it mounts up quickly.That's where you come in.  With this indiegogo campaign I'm hoping to raise at least $1500 to help with these upfront costs.  In the past artists looked to wealthy patrons for support.  I find these times of crowdsourcing and social networking so exciting as it opens up the world of patronage to regular working folks. As a supporter you become like a modern-day Medici, helping an artist (me) continue to create and share my work with the world.
 
But why would you want to support my work.  Well, In this crazy world I continue to believe in the power of beauty and love to transform.   I guess that's why I keep on doing what I do.  It is my hope that my art contributes to this energy, and supports and expresses a world view, based on harmony, love, cooperation and interconnectedness.  What do you get in return for your support.  Just look to the right of my project page and you'll see the different levels of support and all the different art products available for each level.  From greeting cards, to miniature canvasses, to little hand-painted boxes, to my journal for your own creative work, to giclee prints, original art, and commissioned work there are many options from which to choose.I would be so very grateful for any and all support you can offer.  Even if you can't offer monetary support at this time, it would be wonderful if you could pass the word on to your friends about my campaign.  Thanks a lot and maybe I'll see you at one of the markets.

pets, but each owner means the the whole world to the pet. They deserve to be
remembered because I guarantee they’ll always remember you. That’s why I
started this project. I want to draw your beloved friend a portrait with the
date you met and the day he/she left written on the side. I want you to recall
the happy times you’ve spent together whenever you looked at the portrait after
he/she left. <p></p><p>
</p><p>The inspiration for this
project comes from several failed attempts to own a pet. I once had a black poodle
and two cats when I was in college. My first cat “puppy” was with me for 52
days. Since having a pet in the dorm was not allowed, I had to give her away
eventually. I then met my second cat, ""Wasabi"" during junior year. Wasabi was with
me for quite sometime. I used to take her with me on the train ride back home. She
grew so big at the end of the vacation that I couldn’t take her with me on the
train anymore. Luckily, a friend of my mom who really loved the cat adopted
her. I still remember the day we parted. I cried so hard and couldn’t stop
thinking about the happy times we had together. She used to hang herself upside
down on the  bed side begging me to go to
bed with her. Sometimes she would sleep in my backpack when I went out and would
stick her head out to enjoy the street views.</p>
<p> “Mimi” was a black poodle. Though I made up
my mind after “Puppy” and “Wasabi” that I was not going to have a pet during
college anymore, I had to adopt Mimi because a friend in college decided to discard
him. This was my first and last time raising a dog. It’s true what everyone
says about dogs – that they’re truly man’s best friend and loyal beyond belief. When the time came for him to leave, I felt like I lost a friend. Someone who
really understood  me. Fortunately, Mimi
was adopted by a really nice lady and lives a happy life.  </p>
<p>As much as I loved Puppy,
Wasabi and Mimi, I know the image of them is fading away everyday since they
left. As the days pass their image continues to flicker away in my memory until
it seems as if they had never came into my life.</p><h3>About me </h3><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/278580/files/20131225194319-2013_6_.jpg?1388029399"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p>
<p>My name is Lalla Zhang. I’m an
independent illustrator from China. I’ve received hundreds of photos of pets
from their owners after I started this project in China. I just held the “Companions
for Life” art exhibition in June this year, and have published “Companions for Life”
postcards.</p>

cats in my little apartment. “Niu Niu”, “Smelly-smell”, “Shinny Bean”</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/278579/files/20131225194206-IMG_20121029_194654__11.jpg?1388029326"" src="""" style=""""/></p>                                              ""Niu Niu"" and ""Smelly-smell""<p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/278583/files/20131225194921-_.jpg?1388029761"" src="""" style=""""/></p>                                                          “Shinny Bean""<p></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p>
<p>Niu niu and Smelly-smell are a couple. I bought them from
a grandpa selling pets under a bridge on a rainy evening. They were less than a
month old when I brought them home. I had to feed them with cotton swab dipped
in milk until they were old enough to eat cat food. They’ve been living with me
for two years. I adopted Shinny bean less than half a year ago. </p>
<p>Each one of my three little babies has a distinct
personality. Smelly-smell is peaceful and loves lazing around. He enjoys taking
pictures a lot. Niu niu wouldn’t leave me out of sight and has to sleep in my
arm.  Shinny bean is a little timid. She tends
to overact to anyone or anything approaching her. </p>

As an independent illustrator, I work in my apartment
and tend to stay up late finishing projects. So I can say my only daily

to college in Xi’an and still lives there. I want to hold my second exhibition
in Guangzhou, where many of my childhood friends live. Their job has nothing to
do with what they dream of doing. I want to encourage them and show them that
dreams do come true. Afterwards, I want to hold exhibitions in Beijing and

pets, but each owner means the the whole world to the pet. They deserve to be
remembered because I guarantee they’ll always remember you. That’s why I
started this project. I want to draw your beloved friend a portrait with the
date you met and the day he/she left written on the side. I want you to recall
the happy times you’ve spent together whenever you looked at the portrait after
he/she left. 
The inspiration for this
project comes from several failed attempts to own a pet. I once had a black poodle
and two cats when I was in college. My first cat “puppy” was with me for 52
days. Since having a pet in the dorm was not allowed, I had to give her away
eventually. I then met my second cat, ""Wasabi"" during junior year. Wasabi was with
me for quite sometime. I used to take her with me on the train ride back home. She
grew so big at the end of the vacation that I couldn’t take her with me on the
train anymore. Luckily, a friend of my mom who really loved the cat adopted
her. I still remember the day we parted. I cried so hard and couldn’t stop
thinking about the happy times we had together. She used to hang herself upside
down on the  bed side begging me to go to
bed with her. Sometimes she would sleep in my backpack when I went out and would
stick her head out to enjoy the street views.
 “Mimi” was a black poodle. Though I made up
my mind after “Puppy” and “Wasabi” that I was not going to have a pet during
college anymore, I had to adopt Mimi because a friend in college decided to discard
him. This was my first and last time raising a dog. It’s true what everyone
says about dogs – that they’re truly man’s best friend and loyal beyond belief. When the time came for him to leave, I felt like I lost a friend. Someone who
really understood  me. Fortunately, Mimi
was adopted by a really nice lady and lives a happy life.  
As much as I loved Puppy,
Wasabi and Mimi, I know the image of them is fading away everyday since they
left. As the days pass their image continues to flicker away in my memory until
it seems as if they had never came into my life.About me 
My name is Lalla Zhang. I’m an
independent illustrator from China. I’ve received hundreds of photos of pets
from their owners after I started this project in China. I just held the “Companions
for Life” art exhibition in June this year, and have published “Companions for Life”
postcards.
       Hand drawn portrait of golden retriever ""fuzzy"" from the campaign in China
I now “serve” three
cats in my little apartment. “Niu Niu”, “Smelly-smell”, “Shinny Bean”                                              ""Niu Niu"" and ""Smelly-smell""                                                          “Shinny Bean""
Niu niu and Smelly-smell are a couple. I bought them from
a grandpa selling pets under a bridge on a rainy evening. They were less than a
month old when I brought them home. I had to feed them with cotton swab dipped
in milk until they were old enough to eat cat food. They’ve been living with me
for two years. I adopted Shinny bean less than half a year ago. 
Each one of my three little babies has a distinct
personality. Smelly-smell is peaceful and loves lazing around. He enjoys taking
pictures a lot. Niu niu wouldn’t leave me out of sight and has to sleep in my
arm.  Shinny bean is a little timid. She tends
to overact to anyone or anything approaching her. 

As an independent illustrator, I work in my apartment
and tend to stay up late finishing projects. So I can say my only daily
companions are my three babies. To me, they are like family. Them being there
every night when I’m working means a great deal to me. To show my gratitude, I
always buy snacks and canned tuna for them.   
How it works? 
I started this project on Indiegogo
because I want to know about the stories between owners and their pets around
the world. If you would like me to draw a portrait of your pet and share your

<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"">Fusebox needs your help to make sure Haircuts By Children reaches as many youth in our community as possible. the project can accommodate up to 50 students. To reach the goal of 50 5th graders, Fusebox is partnering with two of east Austin's most underprivileged schools: Pecan Springs and Norman Elementary schools. Because we are working with multiple schools Fusebox will need to rent vans to shuttle students to and from the after school workshops and weekend performances.</font></p>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000""><br/></font></p>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"">Secondly, Fusebox needs support for purchasing supplies for the training and performances.

<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000""><br/></font></p>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" color=""#000000"">Finally, the students are paid $10 for each haircut they complete over the two day performance.

What We Need
Your financial contributions will directly support the following:


Provide transportation for the participating students,
Help Fusebox purchase necessary supplies for the training workshops, and
Provide stipends to the students.



Fusebox needs your help to make sure Haircuts By Children reaches as many youth in our community as possible. the project can accommodate up to 50 students. To reach the goal of 50 5th graders, Fusebox is partnering with two of east Austin's most underprivileged schools: Pecan Springs and Norman Elementary schools. Because we are working with multiple schools Fusebox will need to rent vans to shuttle students to and from the after school workshops and weekend performances.

Secondly, Fusebox needs support for purchasing supplies for the training and performances. Critical supplies like mannequin heads (""Judys""), spray bottles, clips, hair product, brushes, combs, etc. are essential (and more expensive than you might think).

Finally, the students are paid $10 for each haircut they complete over the two day performance. This is an important element of the project because it places tangible value on the work, and aesthetics, of the children. The haircuts are free for adult clients, so Fusebox will pay the youth directly. 

What You Get
Contributions of any size are a huge help and appreciated, but as added perks, Fusebox is offering some special incentives for larger gifts like free shirts, priority scheduling and tickets to great events. Details are to the right.

Other Ways You Can Help

Help us get the word out about this wonderful project and our modest fundraising campaign! Social media, talk it up at parties, write thoughtful letters to family and friends.

Also - if you have leads on getting vans or some of the supplies donated - thats as good as a cash contribution - let us know!",1.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong><br/><br/>The Asiatown Print Shop is a silkscreen studio that will be silkscreening original artworks LIVE on the playa at Burningman.  You bring us your shirt, pants, jacket, shorts etc and we will silkscreen it and hand it back to you on the spot so you can have fancy fresh artwork on your playa wear! We will even have black light reactive ink to use!  </p>
<p>This is the inaugural year of the Print Shop and we need your help getting the supplies we need in order to make this a somewhat smooth operation in the dusty dusty desert.</p>
<p>Asiatown Print Shop is part of the French Quarter and will be located within the back alleys of the French Quarter (730 &amp; B) in Black Rock Asiatown.  We will have rotating designs from an ever growing library of original art work that we hope to continue building upon in future years.</p>
<p>Artists who design artwork for the Print Shop retain all copyrights for their work, and all imagery is printed only on the playa.<br/><br/>I set the goal a bit low, but...<br/><strong>We Need Approximately $1,580.</strong></p>
<p>This will cover:<br/>- One 4-color tabletop printing press - $450 <br/>- Screens, ink, emulsion, soy based cleaner, squeegees, plastic bins etc - $350<br/>- Electricity for the heating element to cure the ink and light for the shop - $150<br/>- Shop lights and bulbs - $70<br/>- Two 8ft folding tables - $250  <br/>- Heavy duty garbage bags and plastic sheeting to protect screens - $50 <br/>- Costco car port to set up the shop in  - $230<br/>- Tarp for the bottom of the Costco car port  - $30<br/><br/><strong>What You Get:</strong><br/>With contributions of varying degrees, you will get a patch, tote bag, t-shirt, or sweatshirt printed on the playa, with original artwork from the Asiatown Print Shop and sent to wherever you are located!  <br/>Contributors at any level get access to secret screens on the playa with a super secret password :-)<br/><br/><br/><strong>The Impact</strong><br/>Last year was my first time at Burningman.  I joined the Golden Cafe and French Quarter camps and was blown away by how many incredible projects were housed within them (a bakery, a voodoo botanica, a live jazz band, a coffee house that roasts raw beans on playa, a gumbo cookery, a vineyard, a brewery, a supper club, a bathhouse, a wine cellar, a ramshackle whiskey bar, an elegant cocktail lounge, a farmer's market, and a hotel).  I was a bar back in the Golden Cafe, but wanted to do more than hang out in the bar serving drinks.  I wanted to produce something that could be taken home with people and cherished, or gifted.  </p>
<p>Since I have a lot of experience with silkscreening and have some supplies already, I decided to bring my skills out this year with a silkscreen shop, in addition to tending bar at the Golden Cafe. </p>
<p>With the Print Shop, I hope to contribute to the participatory aspects of Burningman, as well as develop a library of original artwork images that the Print Shop will be able to pull from in future years, and which will be printed only on the playa.    </p>
<p>We will also be collecting garments to silkscreen during Print Shop down time so that we have some ready to wear garments if anyone needs any.</p>
<p><strong>No Water!</strong><br/>We will be using only plastisol inks which means we will not be using any water at all in the printing process, and the inks will not dry in the screens rendering them useless.  </p>

   ‘Visionary Pop Surrealism’ is one way to describe the paintings I improvise live -in front of the audience.  The artwork shown in my gallery above are all Inspired by Live music and atmosphere! - My art is a moving , ever changing  installation on an easel! I have traveled to over 50 music festivals across the nation to bring live art performance to the people. My vision of colorful, organic shapes and forms.. I  create to express the ever evolving beauty in nature..
I paint a picture of positivity and I can give back love and creativity into my community
 

Last summer we saw some wicked weather that destroyed alot of my equipment and even..... original artwork.    
  So For this season-  I am asking for your help to start this year with something  professional, sturdy and fresh for the festivals and create a Live art gallery that is a welcoming  and safe space  to feature my art.   With the support for my new art space, I want to inspire my new friends to come in - sit back, and relax with me, and check out my newest paintings!   :)

Their first evening length work, <em>Iron Daisies</em>, will be presented at Velocity Dance Center on October 18<sup>th</sup> &amp; 19<sup>th</sup>, 2013. Their interest is in exploring the capacity of movement and sound through various artistic mediums. Entropy blurs the line between dance and accompaniment by directly incorporating the musician and vocalizations into the choreography. Their underlying idea is to create and develop their work in full view of the audience every time it is performed. This requires not only rehearsal time for movement and sound, but also time to gain familiarity with the technical aspects of the work such as the use of microphones, loop pedals, effects, and various electronics. The electronics are used not only as a tool for accompaniment, but as another form of expression for both the musician and dancers. The music and dance equally initiate one another throughout this process. Set choreography is manipulated and moved through cues in the sound which are also created live by each performer. Entropy will often explore their relationship with the audience through verbal or physical engagement. These aspects of the work make each performance unique. Through this collaborative process Entropy is able to create work that challenges the boundaries between dancer and musician, as well as audience and performer.

</p><p>During the late 1980s, West Hollywood
was a hotbed of cultural experimentation around video, performance, and digital
art. The independent video space EZTV, then located on Santa Monica Boulevard,
was an epicenter for creativity across a range of new media. </p>
<p>Fiercely independent, this group of artists, including pioneering digital artists, dared to experiment in a medium so new that it
was yet to be accepted in the mainstream art establishment. In the past, art
institutions have often over-looked the transformative cultural contributions
made through the experiments conceived by a small group of digital artists and
their collaborating engineers and other creative thinkers. Today’s now
ubiquitous use of new media, in everything from the visual, sound, and
performing arts, owes much to the contributions made these artists. </p>
<p>The celebrate this rich yet under-recognized history, <b>EZTV</b>, <b>LA ACM SIGGRAPH</b>, <b>ONE National Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives</b>,
and the <b>City of West Hollywood </b>will present a free public art event to draw public attention to these pioneering artists and the spaces and
organizations that’s supported their work, as well as those who follow in their
footsteps. We hope that you will join us and help light up a community and its
history.  </p>
<br/><p></p><h1>About ONE Night<br/>
</h1>For one night, an exciting collaboration of artists and thinkers will come together to stage a free, immersive art event on <b>May 31, 2014</b> in the West Hollywood Park. <b><a href=""http://one.usc.edu/one-night/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ONE Night: EZTV, LA ACM SIGGRAPH, and Digital Art in West Hollywood</a><i> </i></b>brings together four unique organizations seeking to draw attention to the rich history of digital art in Southern California: <b>EZTV</b>, an artist run video space and one of the first arts organizations to curate and show digital art; <b>LA ACM SIGGRAPH</b>, the foremost association for computer graphics and interactive technologies; <b>ONE National Gay &amp; Lesbian Archives</b>, the largest LGBTQ archive in the world; and the <b>City of West Hollywood</b>.

<br/><br/>In addition to numerous large-scale projections, the event will
include live music, dance, telematics, and multimedia performances. Both a
retrospective of pioneering digital artists and a showcase of contemporary
practitioners, through projections onto both buildings and an aerial inflatable, the event will transform the parkgrounds into an evening-long experiential and multi-faceted media installation.<br/><br/>ONE Night coincides with the conclusion of the three-month long exhibition <i><b><a href=""http://one.usc.edu/eztv/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">EZTV: Video Transfer</a><a href=""http://one.usc.edu/eztv/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></b></i> at <b>ONE Archives Gallery &amp; Museum. </b>While ONE Night focuses on EZTV’s contributions to digital art history, <i>EZTV: Video Transfer</i> explores EZTV’s equally important early role in the fostering and presenting of queer video.<br/><br/>ONE Nights will
highlight the contributions of a generation of forward thinking artists who
helped birth a new art form. Digital art
pioneers, they created some of the first digital images to be projected
for site specific and large-scale live art events.<br/><br/><br/><h1><b>The Artists<br/></b></h1><p>

One such artist, <b>Ron Hays,</b> was the foremost pioneer of the field during the 1980s.
An Emmy Award winning director, Hays created projections using a combination of
digital synthesizers, animation, and dance to visualize music for everyone from Frank Gehry, the experimental WNET television lab pieces along with artist Nam June Paik, to the Boston and Los Angeles Philharmonic Symphonies. Like many of the innovative and now almost forgotten queer artists who worked with EZTV, Hays died of AIDS at the height of his career and at the age of 45.

<h1>How Can You Help Make This Happen</h1>
With your help, this evening can bring a visually stunning, immersive, and engaging art experience free to the public. It will also begin a discussion of the important contributions to the field by artists who dared to work with new mediums, giving voice to new methods of expression, and, for some, have yet to be included in the official histories.The City of West Hollywood has generously contributed both funds to realize this ambitious program and access to public facilities; however, additional support is needed to realize the project as envisioned. That is why we are reaching out to the greater community to help in bringing attention to this rich history widely unknown to the public.<p></p>
<p></p><p></p><p>We need an additional <b>$10,000.00</b>. If we raise more we will be able to expand the project reach and pay artists. Your donation to this public art event will also be <b>tax deductible</b>.</p><p>The funding will help us:</p><ul>

</ul><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h1>The Impact<br/>
</h1><p></p>This project brings a community together to celebrate the history of digital art and the significant contributions made by women, LGBTQ individuals, and other under-recognized communities of artists.

It will also begin a discussion of the important contributions to the field by artists who dared to work with new mediums, giving voice to new methods of expression, and, for some, have yet to be included in the official histories.The City of West Hollywood has generously contributed both funds to realize this ambitious program and access to public facilities; however, additional support is needed to realize the project as envisioned. That is why we are reaching out to the greater community to help in bringing attention to this rich history widely unknown to the public.
We need an additional $10,000.00. If we raise more we will be able to expand the project reach and pay artists. Your donation to this public art event will also be tax deductible.The funding will help us:
Rent two powerful 20k lumens projectors with media servers.
Pay technical crew and transportation.
Rent a three phase power generator and distribution.
Rent a sound system for performances. 

The Impact
This project brings a community together to celebrate the history of digital art and the significant contributions made by women, LGBTQ individuals, and other under-recognized communities of artists. These early practitioners and advocates for today’s now ubiquitous media arts revolution have been often-overlooked. ONE Night seeks to remedy these over-sights.Other Ways You Can Help 
If you can't contribute funds, but would like to help the project, here are some other ways to get involved:
Help us get the word out and make some noise about ONE Night. Share the campaign via social media and tell your friends! 

We need volunteers. If you are interested in volunteering the day of the event, please email  eztv@eztvmedia.com.

If you have access to equipment that you can share for the event, we'd like to hear from you. Please email us at  eztv@eztvmedia.com if you think you have the advanced projection equipment needed for such an ambitious program. 

Thank You

Many thanks for considering funding this project. Your support is deeply appreciated as donations from generous people like you help make it possible for artists to create work, share stories, performances, and music and to remember our shared legacies. Thank you.

I'm a visual artist working with photography and organic processes. I and am hungry to learn and develop my practise. 
Thanks to your generous support so far, I have been able to attend the photography course at Dartmoor Arts Summer School, the content of which built on the concerns and approaches that I explore as part of my practise. It has been a phenomenal experience full of learning, inspiration and confidence building.I now need your help to reach the target so that I can pay off the balance for the course.
More about the course:Photo Work : 5 Approaches to Contemporary Photography at Dartmoor ArtsFive different approaches to photographic image making over the course of five days by five different practitioners, each known for their work in a particular area of contemporary art photography.The course explored how these approaches to working within a natural environment parallel developments in the history of photography, from the early explorations of Fox Talbot and Anna Aitkins with cyanotypes and direct sun print methods, through to the opening up of space with pinhole and lens based cameras and camera obscuras, to a focus on place, the observation of natural phenomena and projection of memory and internal narratives that form the content of much contemporary photography.The course program began with an introduction by Susan Derges, and included 5 extraordinary days of workshops by 5 experts in their fields: Liz Nicol: cyanotypesSian Bonnell: pinholeTom Hunter: a performative approach with large format pinholeJem Southam: a painterly approach with large format (and ladder) Chrystel Lebas: twilight photographyThe evenings included talks, debates, performance and meeting amazing peopleI WILL BE WRITING MORE ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE ON MY BLOG!Where will the money go:

540: Cost of the course including material £540 

£20: Portfolio review with Susan Derges

£80: Travel

£105: Bunk accommodation

£150: post course production cost
£26: (estimate to make it a nice looking £1001 for Indiegogo Fees)

<h3><strong>A thrilling opportunity to go to the Terni Festival!</strong></h3>
<p>Last year, you helped me raise money to go to Banff and that residency was a life-changing experience! I can't thank you enough! The research I began at Banff has fed my work this entire year and is influencing my ideas for Terni. At this point, I've been invited to attend this year's festival with an eye to future collaboration.</p>
<p>This is a really big deal!!! This is my first invitation to a European festival outside of the UK and I'm hoping it will lead to many more European opportunities.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.ternifestival.it/?p=2069"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Terni Festival"">http://www.ternifestival.it/?p=2069</a></p>
<p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The Terni Festival is providing my accommodation, however, I need to get there :)</p>
<p>So, my dear friends &amp; supporters, I'm asking you to please help me raise $1300 to cover the cost of airfare ($1200 Toronto to Rome) plus train travel to Terni ($100). I'll be covering all other costs (food, ground transportation, research materials).</p>
<p>As a thank you, I will create individualized Italian love videos for all donations of $100 or more. Book them now &amp; it will be ready by Christmas for you to give to your loved ones (or a special treat for yourself).</p>
<p>ALSO! Please note that the Dinner perk ($250) is for two. I tried to edit the perk but it was too late to do so...</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>I first met the Artistic Director several years ago and we talked about other artists. Now is my chance to go as an artist myself! </p>
<p>My career is based on calculated risk. Each time I have taken the chance to follow up on a presenter's interest in me by demonstrating my interest in them by showing up at their festival - it's had positive results. My most recent example is my inclusion in this year's Expermentica (Cardiff, Wales) which developed out of a similar reconnaissance trip such as this one to Italy. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>$10 or $20 is great! But hey, I know when finances are tight even that can be too much. If you'd still like to help, you can! Please spread the word to people you think might appreciate my work and might appreciate the struggle of the freelance artist. Facebook, twitter, and whatever else is out there that I don't even know about...</p>
<p>Any encouragement is very welcome!</p>
<p>Thank you so much,</p>
<p>xo Cathy</p>

<h3>About Me.....</h3>
<p>     I am a midwesterner, born and raised, who finished art school back home, and decided to move to Boston about five years ago.  In that time, I've found the art scene here to be a bit lackluster, and am campaigning to do some big exciting creative things.  With this campaign, I hope to inspire others and bring more vitality and color to an art scene that could use a good shot in the arm!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>    Ideally, we are trying to raise $3,000 to buy some new art pieces that are striking and bold, yet classy and marketable all at the same time.  The proceeds from these sales will just go back into the Boston art scene, to help sustain the beautiful and creative minds that support it nowadays.</p>
<p>     Should we not reach our goal, whatever we do raise will go toward the same initiative to help even just with beginning the funding, a ""jumpstart"" if you will.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>If you can't donate.......</h3>
<p>      Please feel free to link our Indiegogo site to any of your friends and family on social media or thru email.  Every little bit counts, and we're looking forward to doing some big things with the help of all of you.  Thanks guys!</p>

<p>I’m Rudy Shepherd, an artist based in New York

evil through the mediums of painting, drawing and sculpture. This exploration
involves investigations into the lives of criminals and victims of crime. I
explore the complexity of these stories and the grey areas between innocence
and guilt in a series of paintings and drawings of both the criminals and the
victims, making no visual distinctions between the two. Going along with these portraits
is a series of sculptures called the <b>Black Rock Negative Energy Absorbers</b>. 
I have made many of these over the years, the first of which was a 24 ft tall
sculpture that was installed at the Socrates Sculpture Park in Long Island
City, NY in 2006. They are a group of sculptures meant to remove negative
energy from people, allowing them to respond to life with the more positive
aspects of their personality.</span></p>
<p>I have been given an amazing opportunity to create a
10 foot tall Black Rock Negative Energy Absorber at <b>First Green Park</b>,
which is located on the corner of 2<sup>nd</sup> Avenue and East Houston
street, right across the street from Whole Foods.  It is a prime location
that gets a lot of foot traffic and is a great opportunity for me to engage
with an audience of people from all walks of life many of whom may never set
foot in a gallery.</p>
<h3><b>The Impact</b></h3>
<p>The Black Rock Negative
Energy Absorber (BRNEA) will be built on site beginning on May 5, 2014 by myself and a
few intrepid volunteers.</p>
<p>The sculpture will
remain on the site for six months with the possibility of an extension of another six months.</p>
<p>During this time the
sculpture will be pulling negative energy from passersby, grounding it into the
earth and leaving people lighter and freer than they were before their contact
with the BRNEA.</p>
<p>Six months should be enough time to see a significant decrease in the crime rate and prescription
rate of anti-depressants.</p>
<p>There will be an
unveiling ceremony on Saturday, May 31st at which the Black Rock Negative
Energy Absorber will be charged up and activated.  </p>
<p>There will also be an
internment ceremony, which no one will be invited to, where the sculpture will
be destroyed and the negative energy dispersed.</p>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p><strong>Construction Materials and other expenses - $8,500.00</strong></p>
<p>·  2 x 4's and
dimensional lumber</p>
<p>·  steel lathe</p>
<p>·  concrete and
concrete dye</p>
<p>·  amethyst
crystals</p>
<p>·  rental of a
cement mixer, wheel barrel, scaffolding</p>
<p>·  demolition and

<p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can

<p>If you cannot afford to
contribute but are interested in supporting this project, I invite you to
contact me about volunteering for the construction or demolition of the
sculpture.</p>
<p>Or, you could pass this

<p><b><span><br/></span></b></p><h2><b>Why are we doing this?</b></h2><p></p>
<p>We started 'The River Has Two Banks' in 2012. The program ran over a
three-month period and spanned geographical locations from Ramallah and Bierzeit
to Amman and the Jordan Valley. We invited artists who were looking at the
historical and contemporary relationships of Jordan and Palestine with a
critical eye, through film, music, research, and text-based works. We organized
a hike to the River Jordan in an unsuccessful attempt to challenge the notion that the river is
not accessible – but its true! You cannot get to the river unless you are being
baptized.</p>
<p>We got a lot of feedback on the importance of our project: working on
bridging  the relationship between two
people who are so close geographically, socially and culturally - yet segregated
politically. The project created encounters for people to engage and exchange
professionally, and make new friendships. </p>

Who are we?
We are three friends who work in the arts, from both Jordan and
Palestine. We actually became friends over long discussions on why
Palestinians do not stay in Amman more often to get to know the place, and how
difficult it is for Jordanians to visit Palestine. One thing led to another,
and we came up with 'The River Has Two Banks' - a curatorial platform that
allows us to facilitate exchange and communication between Jordanian and
Palestinian artists, writers, thinkers and travelers. 
Shuruq Harb is a visual artist, curator and writer based in Ramallah,
Palestine. She is the co-founder of ArtTerritories, an online publishing
platform on art and visual culture from the Arab world. Samah Hijawi is
a visual artist, curator, writer and part of the Makan collective based in Jordan. Toleen
Touq is an independent cultural operator based in Amman, who curates
and programs multi-disciplinary exhibitions, festivals and workshops.
Why are we doing this?
We started 'The River Has Two Banks' in 2012. The program ran over a
three-month period and spanned geographical locations from Ramallah and Bierzeit
to Amman and the Jordan Valley. We invited artists who were looking at the
historical and contemporary relationships of Jordan and Palestine with a
critical eye, through film, music, research, and text-based works. We organized
a hike to the River Jordan in an unsuccessful attempt to challenge the notion that the river is
not accessible – but its true! You cannot get to the river unless you are being
baptized.
We got a lot of feedback on the importance of our project: working on
bridging  the relationship between two
people who are so close geographically, socially and culturally - yet segregated
politically. The project created encounters for people to engage and exchange
professionally, and make new friendships. 
By supporting the continuation of our programming into 2013 and 2014, you are
helping in creating radical new ways for the creatives of the region to meet!
Past artists we've hosted
So far, we have hosted and/or collaborated with artists Noor Abed, Tarek
Abu Kweik (El Fer3i), Joseph Audeh, Sandi Hilal, Bashar Humeid, Saba Innab,
Annemarie Jacir, Khaled Jarrar, Dalia Kury, Sandra Madi, Clemens Messerschmidt, Oraib
Toukan, Eileen Simpson and Ben White, Mohannad Yacubi and Ahmad Zatari.

 من نحن؟نحن مجموعة مكوّنة من ثلاث صديقات يعملن في الفنون من الأردن وفلسطين. نستطيع القول أن صداقتنا نشأت بعد نقاشات طويلة حول السبب الذي يحول دون مجيء الفلسطينيين إلى عمّان بشكل أكبر، وبقائهم فيها لمدة أطول حتى يتسنّى لهم معرفة المكان، وحول صعوبة زيارة الأردنيين لفلسطين. ومن نقاش إلى آخر، خرجنا بفكرة ""للنهر ضفتان""، وهي منصة تفاعليّة تنظيميّة تمكّننا من تيسير التبادل والتواصل بين الفنانين الأردنيين والفلسطينيين، والكتّاب، والمفكّرين والرحّالة. شروق حرب هي فنانة بصريّة، ومُيسّرة وكاتبة تعيش في رام الله بفلسطين. وهي من المؤسسين لمبادرة ""Art Territories"" التي تعد منصة الكترونيّة لنشر المحتوى حول الفن والثقافة البصريّة في العالم العربي. أما سماح حجاوي فهي فنانة بصرية، ومُيسّرة وكاتبة، وجزء من فريق مكان وتقيم في عمّان. والصديقة الثالثة هي تولين توق، وهي مُيسّرة ثقافيّة مستقلة تقيم في عمّان، حيث تُيّسر وتنظّم المعارض، والمهرجانات، وورش العمل متعددة المجالات. لماذا نقوم بهذا العمل؟بدأنا العمل في ""للنهر ضفتان"" في عام 2012. وعلى مدار ثلاثة شهور، انتشر عمل البرنامج في مواقع جغرافيّة متعددة من رام الله وبير زيت إلى عمّان وغور الأردن. قُمنا بدعوة فنانين يبحثون في العلاقات التاريخيّة والمعاصرة بين الأردن وفلسطين، ويعرضون وجهات نظر نقديّة من خلال الأفلام، والموسيقى، والبحث، والأعمال القائمة على النصوص. ونظّمنا أيضاً رحلة إلى نهر الأردن في محاولة لم يكتب لها النجاح لتحدّي الفكرة السائدة بأن الناس غير قادرين على الوصول إلى النهر، لنكتشف أنها حقيقة، إذ لا يمكنك الوصول إلى النهر إلا في حالة ""التعميد"".لحسن الحظ، نحصل على الكثير من التغذية الراجعة حول أهميّة مشروعنا التي تتلخص في العمل على بناء جسور التواصل بين شعبين مترابطين جداً على المستوى الجغرافي، والاجتماعي، والثقافي، ولكنهما منفصلان سياسيّاً. ونجح المشروع في توفير الفرصة للعديد من اللقاءات ليتسنّى للناس التفاعل مع بعضهم البعض، وتبادل الخبرات على المستوى المهني، وإقامة صداقات جديدة.من خلال دعم إكمال برامجنا حتى نهاية عام 2013 وفي عام 2014، فإنك تساعدنا في خلق طرق جديدة غير مألوفة لجمع المبدعين في المنطقة في مكان واحد.فنانون استضفناهم في السابقحتى اليوم، استضفنا أو تعاونّا مع فنانين كثيرين وهم: نور عبد، طارق أبو كويك (الفرعي) ، جوزف عودة، ساندي هلال، بشار حميض، صبا عنّاب، آن ماري جاسر، خالد جرّار، ساندرا ماضي، وليمانس ماسيرشميدت، عريب طوقان، إلين سيمبسون، بين وايت، مهند يعقوبي، أحمد الزعتري. يمكنك مشاهدة قائمة بكل الأحداث والفعاليات السابقة، والمساهمات على موقعنا الالكتروني، كما يمكنك قراءة مراجعة حول برنامج العام الفائت على موقع ""جدليّة"".

""الفرعي"" يقدّم عرضاً في بير زيت في فلسطينماذا نحتاج منكم؟نحتاج إلى جمع 2000 $ من التبرعات الشعبيّة. وسينفق هذا المبلغ كما يلي:- تكاليف ورسوم السفر لأربعة فنانين للانتقال من فلسطين إلى الأردن أو بالعكس، وعرض أعمالهم أمام جماهير جديدة.- تكاليف الترجمة من أجل تمكيننا من نشر كل نصوصنا بالإنجليزيّة والعربيّة.- إعلانات على الفيسبوك للترويج لفعالياتنا.لقد نجنا في تأمين الإقامة للفنانين في عمّان ورام الله من خلال دعم الفنادق الصغيرة السخي.  ما الذي تحصل عليه بعد الدعم؟إلى جانب امتناننا لتبرعكم، نقدم لكم المكافآت التالية:10 $ - نشكركم علنيّاً على صفحتنا على الفيسبوك على دعمكم. 25 $ - المكافأة السابقة بالإضافة إلى بطاقة بريديّة شخصيّة من تصميم المشروع وموقعة من قبل الميسرين. 100 $ -  المكافأة السابقة بالإضافة إلى ذكر اسمكم كمؤيدين للمشروع على صفحتنا الالكترونية.   500 $ - كل المكافأت السابقة، إلى جانب عشاء مكون من المقبلات وطبق رئيسي والحلوى، والذي نقوم نحن بطبخه وتحضيره من أشهى المأكولات من المطبخ المتوسطي. كما ندعو واحد أو اثنين من الفنانين الذين عملنا معهم في السابق، فقط عليك أن تصل إلى عمّان أو رام الله، او يمكننا أن نلتقي في مكان آخر إذا كان أي منا مسافر إلى مكان آخر في العالم.
إن لم نتمكن من الوصول إلى الهدف من التمويل، أو الحد المطلوب، سوف نكتفي بالمبلغ المتوفّر فقط. سنكمل العمل، ولكن قد نضطر إلى تقليل عدد الفعاليات لتناسب المبلغ المتوفر. يمكنك المساعدة بوسائل أخرىإذا كنت لا تستطيع دعمنا مالياً، لا تفقد الأمل. نتمنى أن تساهم في نشر حملتنا قدر الإمكان، لذلك نرجو منكم مشاركة المعلومات والأخبار حول الحملة مع أصدقائكم ومعارفكم.لكم منا جزيل الشكر.

</ul><ul>
<i>  </i><em></em>The Painted Pony™ is our idea of the perfect hacienda/bed and breakfast combined beautifully with an Artist/Writer/Photographer Residency Program.  This existing Hacienda (currently operational under a different name) sits on many acres of quiet, rolling land in the eastern foothills adjoining Santa Fe's city limits.  With authentic adobe structures, dedicated guest hacienda, a private casita, inviting and colorful guest rooms, kiva fireplaces, and hiking trails, The Painted Pony™ is destined to become a B&amp;B favorite!   There is also enough acreage to incorporate a horse rescue shelter, a goal that creates a safe and healthy environment for rescue horses, and offers the guests and artists who are in residence the opportunity to experience a horse ranch.  The Hacienda/Inn experience at The Painted Pony™ is all that it implies; a fusion of ART and culture, nature and beauty.  The B&amp;B and the Artist Residency will co-exist, offering the guest an experience unmatched anywhere.  The Painted Pony™  will tie the hacienda/B&amp;B experience to the Artist experience.  We will blend guest lodging with a gallery, and encourage nationally diverse artists<br/>to produce one of kind pieces to be appreciated here, in Santa Fe. </ul><ul></ul><ul>

<p><strong><em>Why we need your help:</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em></em></strong> </p>
<p><strong><em></em></strong> </p>
<p><strong>We have taken The Painted Pony/Artist In Residence Program as far as our resources and efforts will allow.  On our own, we have 1/3 of what we need to start.  We need your help to make up the difference and become operational!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We need to produce enough capital to acquire the transitioning locale, to cover the costs of marketing and initial operating expenses, and to set in place the residency program itself; within Institutions, galleries, notable websites, and publications. The goal with this campaign is to help get us there, and get us open for mid-summer! <strong> We need your help to make this happen!  </strong>The Painted Pony/Artist In Residence program operational costs, funding, and continued support thereafter will come from us, and from the operational budget of the B&amp;B.  By flow funding from the B&amp;B, the amount of residencies will increase each year, allowing for more concentrated programs, longer residencies, and collaborations for larger projects and larger teams. This keeps The Painted Pony Artist In Residence Program thriving, year after year!  </p>
<p><strong>Your help here, on our Indiegogo campaign, helps us get off the ground!</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong> </p>
<p><strong></strong>  <i><strong>Our goal:</strong></i></p>
<p>We need your help to allow us to: </p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Take over</strong> operations of the existing hacienda and build out an additional, dedicated artist workshop.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fund </strong>the Artists, Writers and Photographers In Residence Program, with free room and board, amenities, and provide workshops for the artists and guests who wish to attend. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Establish</strong> a network based referral and application system for artists and writers across the nation, through publications, website hosting and nominations through partnerships with galleries and art institutes.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Accept</strong> a minimum of 21 Residencies each and every year.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Provide </strong>art supplies, and create voluntary evening workshops for the guests who stay at The Painted Pony™ as a social, fun and engaging vacation experience.</p></li>
<br/><strong></strong><strong></strong><strong><em>Our Stretch Goals:  </em></strong><strong><em></em></strong>Should funding on our campaign surpass our goal, we can implement goals that are otherwise long-term or 2nd and 3rd year goals such as incorporating a horse rescue shelter on outlying acreage, to be maintained by a fully 501c non-profit organization, and accessible to our guests and our artists, building an additional Art Camp facility on site to offer annual summer art camps for children in the region, instructed by artists who have held residency with us.  </ul>
<ul></ul>
<ul></ul>
<ul>
<strong>Our goal is to be open for operation by mid-summer!</strong><strong></strong><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/322084/files/20140121133502-6_Aurora__T_Paden__WMM.jpg?1390340102"" src="""" style=""width: 340.03px; height: 253px;""/></p>

</ul><p><br/><i><strong>WHAT AN ""ARTIST IN RESIDENCE"" PROGRAM 						ACCOMPLISHES:</strong></i></p><p><strong><em></em></strong> </p><p>For the artist, a residency is <strong>opportunity</strong>. Artists, writers and photographers are invited to residencies or retreats to work, to create, to challenge themselves and to produce inspired work. It is a way for them to simultaneously disappear into seclusion, and awaken themselves to something new, fresh, and <strong>igniting</strong>. The city artist who comes to the Sangre de Christo mountains of Santa Fe leaves imprinted with the color of the city. The artist or writer from suburbia finds quiet stillness in the foothills and mountains, and is then inspired to <strong>infuse</strong> that emotion into their work.  </p><p><br/>These week or two week long stays are free to the artist, and often combine workshops, gatherings, and collaborations with other artists who are in residency as well. At The Painted Pony, artists and writers will be invited on an individual basis and group residencies. We will ask our artists to donate one piece of significant art, whether produced on-site or perhaps already in their collection, and those pieces will be auctioned off in fundraiser event annually to which ALL proceeds will fund youth art programs, specifically programs in need in the Santa Fe area. Art programs have  become the first to be cut in the ever-tightening budget belts of our schools. Support in the way of supplies and funding help keep them thriving and keep young generations exploring their creative potential.</p><p> </p><p>**<strong><em>Artist and Writer residencies are FREE to the artists/writers.  These are necessary programs that allow for creative reflection and production.  It is very much a respectful nod to the artist to say 'we appreciate what you give us, the imprint you leave on the world'. </em></strong></p><p><br/> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/314950/files/20140117175915-plaza_daytime.jpg?1390010355"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>Why Santa Fe?</strong></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> In Santa Fe, Art fights only with Culture, and often the two are wrapped and wound so tightly together that it's impossible to tell them apart. It is the backbone of the <strong>City Different</strong>. It is what defines this community as unique; the festivals, the individuality, the sheer abundance of culture and art, and the craft of creating. There are over 200 museums and galleries in the city center alone.  Art IS Santa Fe. However, Artist in Residence programs are only found at the Institute or Art College, and for a city of such inspired and saturated art, it is surprisingly devoid of free residencies for Artist, Photographers, and Writers, especially ones that offer vacation style residencies.  What we offer to the artist who takes up residency is inspiration on a <br/>magnificent scale, time to create, a place to showcase their work, and an open door to networking possibilities they otherwise may not have.</p><p><br/> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/322092/files/20140121133847-2_Bison_at_Dusk__T_Paden__WM_72dpi_10_in.jpg?1390340327"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>**For more information on our experience in the industry, relative facts and what makes us single-handedly the perfect combination to make this a success, please see our comments at the end and our ABOUT ME section!**<br/></p><p> <strong><em>Why Indiegogo?</em></strong></p><p><strong><em></em></strong> </p><p>Collaborative fundraising for projects that we can support and get behind has huge implications.  This act of crowd funding changes the way ideas, innovations, businesses, art, projects and charities are managed; the backer becomes you, the contribution becomes applause for what you are doing, the project becomes reality instead of cool 'what if's' and the communities that benefit from these projects see an increase in awareness and functionality.  It's taking back our power to create.  It is filling a void where there is a need, or a desire.  It is having the ability to say 'I helped do this'.  Great ideas are born everyday and good collaborations get them accomplished. </p><p> </p><p><strong><em>Ways you can help:</em></strong></p><p> </p><p>In the spirit of collaboration, we have put together the following list of ways that you can help us achieve our goal!  When we reach our goal, it is because of YOUR support and share power!

Crowd funding is a powerful option and by supporting through crowd funding you are becoming a part of a global, trending movement to put the power back in the hands of people.  You, the contributor, can say you not only support this, but you backed it, even if it's just a few dollars!  Read our mission, discover our perks, decide how much you can afford to donate and become a part of The Painted Pony™ forever!  REASONS WHY WE THINK YOU WILL WANT TO BACK OUR CAMPAIGN AND CONTRIBUTE TO HELP MAKE IT HAPPEN: 1.   Santa Fe, NM is largely known as the Art Mecca of the Southwest but surprisingly has only two art residency programs/options.  The Painted Pony™ can help fill that void.2. You support small business that gives back: *Unique guest lodging that gives free residencies for writers/artists/photographers to further their creative goals and to produce enduring work *A small business that fundraises and donates to help get funding to youth art programs and to dedicate space and donations to Horse Rescue Shelters.3. You really dig the artwork in our campaign.  (It's okay.  I'm fascinated by the work also! =)4.  The idea of our 'stretch' goals is not only charitable, but very much needed.  These goals are reached when we surpass our initial goal here, or in the coming future once we have reached our campaign goal.  5.  You believe that The Painted Pony™ is a unique idea (allowing guests to be a part of the artist movement, to join in on workshops, and to transform a simple guest stay/vacation into something a little more creative) and you want to see it succeed.6. You've just discovered that for the price of a pack of gum, you can help build something.  You can collaborate with others in the simple support of a goal and make something very cool happen. That is a powerful concept.                     Hi! We are Austin and Crystal and we are on an exciting mission to launch The Painted Pony™, a Bed and Breakfast/Hacienda coupled with an Artist In Residence Program, aimed at under-the-radar artists and writers from all over our nation to hold productive residencies at The Painted Pony™ in beautiful Santa Fe, New Mexico.  In exchange for your support, we have what we think are pretty great perks such as artwork by renowned Artist Theresa Paden, charitable contributions to phenomenal horse rescue groups, as well as vacation stays! We believe there is something for everyone!       What is The Painted Pony?

  The Painted Pony™ is our idea of the perfect hacienda/bed and breakfast combined beautifully with an Artist/Writer/Photographer Residency Program.  This existing Hacienda (currently operational under a different name) sits on many acres of quiet, rolling land in the eastern foothills adjoining Santa Fe's city limits.  With authentic adobe structures, dedicated guest hacienda, a private casita, inviting and colorful guest rooms, kiva fireplaces, and hiking trails, The Painted Pony™ is destined to become a B&B favorite!   There is also enough acreage to incorporate a horse rescue shelter, a goal that creates a safe and healthy environment for rescue horses, and offers the guests and artists who are in residence the opportunity to experience a horse ranch.  The Hacienda/Inn experience at The Painted Pony™ is all that it implies; a fusion of ART and culture, nature and beauty.  The B&B and the Artist Residency will co-exist, offering the guest an experience unmatched anywhere.  The Painted Pony™  will tie the hacienda/B&B experience to the Artist experience.  We will blend guest lodging with a gallery, and encourage nationally diverse artiststo produce one of kind pieces to be appreciated here, in Santa Fe. 

                                                        
 

 
 
 
Why we need your help:
 
 
We have taken The Painted Pony/Artist In Residence Program as far as our resources and efforts will allow.  On our own, we have 1/3 of what we need to start.  We need your help to make up the difference and become operational!
 
 
We need to produce enough capital to acquire the transitioning locale, to cover the costs of marketing and initial operating expenses, and to set in place the residency program itself; within Institutions, galleries, notable websites, and publications. The goal with this campaign is to help get us there, and get us open for mid-summer!  We need your help to make this happen!  The Painted Pony/Artist In Residence program operational costs, funding, and continued support thereafter will come from us, and from the operational budget of the B&B.  By flow funding from the B&B, the amount of residencies will increase each year, allowing for more concentrated programs, longer residencies, and collaborations for larger projects and larger teams. This keeps The Painted Pony Artist In Residence Program thriving, year after year!  
Your help here, on our Indiegogo campaign, helps us get off the ground!
 
  Our goal:
We need your help to allow us to: 

Take over operations of the existing hacienda and build out an additional, dedicated artist workshop.  
Fund the Artists, Writers and Photographers In Residence Program, with free room and board, amenities, and provide workshops for the artists and guests who wish to attend. 
Establish a network based referral and application system for artists and writers across the nation, through publications, website hosting and nominations through partnerships with galleries and art institutes.
Accept a minimum of 21 Residencies each and every year.
Provide art supplies, and create voluntary evening workshops for the guests who stay at The Painted Pony™ as a social, fun and engaging vacation experience.
Our Stretch Goals:  Should funding on our campaign surpass our goal, we can implement goals that are otherwise long-term or 2nd and 3rd year goals such as incorporating a horse rescue shelter on outlying acreage, to be maintained by a fully 501c non-profit organization, and accessible to our guests and our artists, building an additional Art Camp facility on site to offer annual summer art camps for children in the region, instructed by artists who have held residency with us.  



Our goal is to be open for operation by mid-summer!


WHAT AN ""ARTIST IN RESIDENCE"" PROGRAM 						ACCOMPLISHES: For the artist, a residency is opportunity. Artists, writers and photographers are invited to residencies or retreats to work, to create, to challenge themselves and to produce inspired work. It is a way for them to simultaneously disappear into seclusion, and awaken themselves to something new, fresh, and igniting. The city artist who comes to the Sangre de Christo mountains of Santa Fe leaves imprinted with the color of the city. The artist or writer from suburbia finds quiet stillness in the foothills and mountains, and is then inspired to infuse that emotion into their work.  These week or two week long stays are free to the artist, and often combine workshops, gatherings, and collaborations with other artists who are in residency as well. At The Painted Pony, artists and writers will be invited on an individual basis and group residencies. We will ask our artists to donate one piece of significant art, whether produced on-site or perhaps already in their collection, and those pieces will be auctioned off in fundraiser event annually to which ALL proceeds will fund youth art programs, specifically programs in need in the Santa Fe area. Art programs have  become the first to be cut in the ever-tightening budget belts of our schools. Support in the way of supplies and funding help keep them thriving and keep young generations exploring their creative potential. **Artist and Writer residencies are FREE to the artists/writers.  These are necessary programs that allow for creative reflection and production.  It is very much a respectful nod to the artist to say 'we appreciate what you give us, the imprint you leave on the world'.    Why Santa Fe?   In Santa Fe, Art fights only with Culture, and often the two are wrapped and wound so tightly together that it's impossible to tell them apart. It is the backbone of the City Different. It is what defines this community as unique; the festivals, the individuality, the sheer abundance of culture and art, and the craft of creating. There are over 200 museums and galleries in the city center alone.  Art IS Santa Fe. However, Artist in Residence programs are only found at the Institute or Art College, and for a city of such inspired and saturated art, it is surprisingly devoid of free residencies for Artist, Photographers, and Writers, especially ones that offer vacation style residencies.  What we offer to the artist who takes up residency is inspiration on a magnificent scale, time to create, a place to showcase their work, and an open door to networking possibilities they otherwise may not have.  **For more information on our experience in the industry, relative facts and what makes us single-handedly the perfect combination to make this a success, please see our comments at the end and our ABOUT ME section!** Why Indiegogo? Collaborative fundraising for projects that we can support and get behind has huge implications.  This act of crowd funding changes the way ideas, innovations, businesses, art, projects and charities are managed; the backer becomes you, the contribution becomes applause for what you are doing, the project becomes reality instead of cool 'what if's' and the communities that benefit from these projects see an increase in awareness and functionality.  It's taking back our power to create.  It is filling a void where there is a need, or a desire.  It is having the ability to say 'I helped do this'.  Great ideas are born everyday and good collaborations get them accomplished.  Ways you can help: In the spirit of collaboration, we have put together the following list of ways that you can help us achieve our goal!  When we reach our goal, it is because of YOUR support and share power! We have outlined our perks in detail and alternative ways that you can help support our campaign. Nothing is insignificant and any support is appreciated.

</div></div>","Dear Friends,I have been accepted for a residency beginning this month at the prestigious Vermont Studio Center.  Oh yes!  And I need your help to get there.  
The residency is  a great opportunity to develop my work, and to meet lots of other artists and writers.  Although I am receiving an artist's scholarship and work study grant to attend, I
still have to pay a portion of the cost of my residency, a significant amount for me.  And that's where you come in!  
If you are able to contribute to help me get to the Vermont Studio Center, I have some fabulous
prizes to offer you-- original artworks
made by me.
Check out these unique perks:


For $25. you get a 9 by 12 inch unique pastel drawing.
For $50. you get a unique handheld painting, 6 x 1-1/2 x 3/4 inches, painted in oil on all 6
sides.
For $75. you get to join me for a one-on-one studio visit in my studio, and pick out a handheld painting or a pastel drawing of your
choice.
For $100. you get a
private studio visit, a pastel drawing AND a handheld painting of your choice.
And for $200 you get all of the above, plus a NEW work that I will create this fall at the Vermont Studio Center!
Please contribute to my campaign and help me go to the
Vermont Studio Center residency.  Thank
you!Pastel Drawing (example)Handheld Painting (example)Studio ShotCheck out my website for more information about me and to see examples of my prior work:http://www.jefffrederick.netAnd if you can't contribute (and believe me, I understand), maybe you can share my campaign with someone who might like some original art?  It's easy to share an Indiegogo campaign.  Any attention you can help me get would be much appreciated!Thank you for your support!Jeff.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

If not you should keep an eye out for us on the playa. This will be her 9th year traveling to Black Rock City The last few years things have really started to show wear and tear.  So she finally got some much needed TLC this summer.  This year we will be much brighter than ever before with 6000 new LED's!  A big investment that really needed to happen. No more EL wire. We have also done a nice upgrade to the propane system. In the past we were only using small propane cylinders to make that big flame. Unfortunately it was very limiting as to how much we could burn. NOW... this year we have the capacity to carry 75+ gallons a night ! </p>
<p>We're looking to raise $1500.00 to help out with the propane costs this year. This will be our first attempt ever to raise funds for the Grasshopper.  Typically we would be OK but this year between the LED's, new generator to power all those strip lights, and other odds and ends for the propane system, we could really use your help!</p>
<p>We have put $1500.00+ into her already between the generator, lights, and propane system.</p>
<p>75 gallons x (appx.) 3.00 gallon = 225.00 a night x 7 =$1575.00</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we're going to do our best to provide as much heat as possible thats within our budget.</p><p>Theres something about providing that burst of fire to the people of the playa late at night.
