<p>This December, VAA is putting on their second annual Christmas production, <i>The Nutcracker Circus Suite,</i> which takes the classical tale of the Nutcracker and tells it through circus, theater, dance, modern music, and audience interaction. The action happens around and above the audience. </p>
<p>We are seeking funding to pay our cast members and help with production costs. Production of a full length show adds up; rehearsal fees, costumes, props, theater rental, and marketing are just a few of the expenses that we will be paying out of pocket. We have an amazing cast on board and our main goal is to pay them as much as we possibly can. All proceeds of our campaign will go towards paying our cast members. </p>
<p>We have a cast of 15 amazing artists who make a living as performance artists. Our cast has generously agreed to take on our low budget production. Our fundraising goal of $5000 will ensure that each of them is paid at least $300 for the run of our show. That breaks down to $75 a show. It is not much money, considering the the hours of rehearsal and time they have committed to this project, but it is a start. The more we can raise, the better!

Our mission is to use the arts as a platform to address a diverse array of modern social issues, increasing the awareness of the societal impact of these issues. By creating events focused on these issues, audiences are motivated to action.

 
We will launch our 2012 Season with the First Annual Real Love Concert, which will bring together poets, singers and musicians in a two-act, catered extravaganza. In-between acts, we will show video clips of notable personalities stressing the value and importance of self-love and self-acceptance.

What is ï¿½realï¿½ love? 
It is our strong belief that ï¿½realï¿½ love cannot have its foundation outside of us, but rather it must come from within. Many spend their lives searching for someone to celebrate them, someone to value them, or someone to tell them theyï¿½re beautiful. We believe it is imperative that these messages come from the most important person in our livesï¿½ourselves. 
 
Why a concert about self-love? 
AMIMS is launching its season with the First Annual Real Love Concert because we believe many of the social issues highlighted throughout our season would be remedied if self-love, self-respect and a positive self-image were engrained into the psyche of every human being. We believe that these fundamental ideals are central to the betterment of society. We will share the message that, regardless of what society tells us, we must think of ourselves as beautifully, wonderfully-made human beings. This February, we are celebrating the beauty of our uniqueness and individuality, and embracing real love by loving ourselves first.


What We Need & What You Get
Any size donation will help offset the costs and turn our vision into a reality. We are a start-up arts organization which is looking for $10,000 in order to fully realize the vision for this project. Some costs of producing The First Annual Real Love Concert include: securing a venue in New York City, booking performers, and renting audio and video equipment. Your support would be greatly appreciated. Also, there are perks for donating!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Alyce Finwall Dance Theater (AFDT) was established in 1999 by artistic director and choreographer, Alyce Finwall.  The mission of AFDT is to blend an unabashed movement language with dramatic expression to create a powerful vehicle for theatrical dance.  Alyce Finwall's choreography has been presented throughout the US and in Europe.</p>
<div class=""n"">
<p>We have been working on ""Angel"" for the past 4 1/2 months.  The piece premiered at the Garage Theater this past February to sold out and very enthusiastic audiences.  This July we will be performing it at ODC Theater as part of the WERK Collective performances.</p>
<p>""Angel"" is a very rigorous 40-minute duet for two incredible dancers/performers, Julia Hollas and Vivian Aragon.  This piece is the third ballet in the ""black ballets"" trilogy, all of which have the same themes of femininity, isolation, aggression and sexuality.  Influenced by the work of Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s “The Yellow Wallpaper” and Virginia Woolf’s “A Room of Her Own”, “Angel"" delves into the surreal and unnerving realm of sexuality and aggressions that pits the audience's glare against the demanding physicality and exposure of the performance. ""Angel"" is a tightly constructed dance piece that inhabits a dark and mysterious room.</p>
<p>The creation of this piece has been an incredible experience for me, and I can say without doubt, that I couldn't have done it without the candid and intelligent input from Julia and Vivian.</p>

<li>""The Constant Effort of Beginning"" – a product of our fall rehearsal season, this ever-moving poem of interlocking group-rhythms and disjunction evokes the uncertainty of an ever-changing world, and the eternal evolution of community.  </li>

<li>A collaboration with New York City-based video artist Sarah Outhwaite will mix dance and video in a never-before-seen exchange of light and motion.</li>
<li>... and other favorites from Quicksilver's repertoire!</li>
</ul><p>And our work doesn't end after the performance.  We are looking forward to beginning a whole new journey in the summer: for the first time, Quicksilver will be going on an international tour to the Montreal Fringe Festival in June 2014!  </p><h3 style=""color: #008822;"">$5,000 Today; Prized Careers Tomorrow</h3><p></p><p>This fundraiser will support nine Quicksilver dancers through three months of development, rehearsal, and performance of ""On the Threshold of Beginning."" <span style=""line-height: 1.45em; text-align: center;"">With the goal of $5,000, we will be able to:</span></p><p></p><ul>

""The Constant Effort of Beginning"" – a product of our fall rehearsal season, this ever-moving poem of interlocking group-rhythms and disjunction evokes the uncertainty of an ever-changing world, and the eternal evolution of community.  
For our newest work, we are beginning simply with a title: ""On The Threshold of Memory."" While the piece started by exploring the hazy world of our earliest memories, its fate is currently unknown... Come be one of the first to see how it develops at the April show!
A collaboration with New York City-based video artist Sarah Outhwaite will mix dance and video in a never-before-seen exchange of light and motion.
... and other favorites from Quicksilver's repertoire!
And our work doesn't end after the performance.  We are looking forward to beginning a whole new journey in the summer: for the first time, Quicksilver will be going on an international tour to the Montreal Fringe Festival in June 2014!  $5,000 Today; Prized Careers TomorrowThis fundraiser will support nine Quicksilver dancers through three months of development, rehearsal, and performance of ""On the Threshold of Beginning."" With the goal of $5,000, we will be able to:
Pay our dancers $12 per hour for ""On the Threshold of Beginning"" rehearsals and shows

Commission new scores for two dances from Boston-based composer Ryan Edwards 

Hire photographer Ganesh Ramashandran to document the performance

<p><b>A musical about the trafficking of women in Thailand</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p></p><p>Here is a story that almost no one knows. In northern Burma, the army is systematically attacking and slaughtering ethnic minorities.  Some of these minority women migrate to Thailand and become sex workers to support their families and keep their people alive.  But American and European aid workers are putting these women in prison for being “victims.”  <i>Land of Smiles</i> will change everything you think you know about human trafficking.</p><p></p><p>Many of you have already heard about Erin Kamler's <i>Land of Smiles</i>, a new musical about the complex issue of sex trafficking in Thailand. The musical just had a successful run of sold-out performances and standing ovations in Chiang Mai, Thailand and we are now working to raise funds for a production that will travel to the International Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August, 2014. The Edinburgh production will allow us the opportunity to expose the show to London critics, international audiences, and, we hope, garner respected festival awards. We are committed to international cultural diversity, so we are excited to be including a cast of actors from both the United States and Thailand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The total amount needed for the Edinburgh production is $75,000. Here on Indiegogo, we hope to reach a goal of between $20,000-$50,000. But to do this, we need your help! Please join us and help make this production happen. Donate to our campaign and bring this powerful dramatic musical to a wide international audience and give it the recognition it deserves.  No amount is too small or too large. We sincerely appreciate your support!</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of our donors will have our eternal gratitude and thanks for supporting this project.  The money raised from this campaign will augment the support of our already committed investors.  If you would like more information on how to join our investment team, please contact us directly.  Our total budget of $75,000 will cover only our transportation, housing, and production costs-- no one gets paid.  Due to the importance of this story, all of our artists and production team are volunteering their time and talents to make this production happen.  </p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><b>ABOUT THE PROJECT</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>The musical is designed to serve as a platform for dialogue and awareness about human trafficking, a subject that has recently exploded onto the international stage as one of the most disturbing, complex and, many claim, pervasive issues of our time. Often dubbed “modern day slavery,” the focus of the movement that has sprung up to stop trafficking has been to “rescue” girls from situations of labor exploitation—specifically having to do with sex work. The problem with these tactics, and indeed, the entire movement to end human trafficking, is that often the most well intended of advocates do little to empower the women they are trying to “save.”</p>
<p><i>Land of Smiles</i> responds to the crippled policies, practices and moralisms that underlie the anti-trafficking movement, by zooming in on Thailand and Burma, two countries in a region of the world known as an “infamous” trafficking hub. The story explores the way a U.S. funded non-governmental organization (NGO) responds to Lipoh, a young Kachin sex worker caught in the wrong brothel at the wrong time. Trying in earnest to “rescue” this exploited “victim,” the NGO relies on Lipoh’s victim status in order to secure the prosecution of her supposed “traffickers.” But as the narrative unfolds, we soon discover that Lipoh does not see herself as a voiceless, agency-less trafficking victim. Rather, she shares emotional, social, financial and political bonds with both her “carrier” – the woman who transported her from Burma into Thailand—and her “Mama San”-- the owner of the brothel where she worked. Far from experiencing her situation as oppressive, or akin to conditions of slavery, Lipoh finds strength in her relationships with her supposed “traffickers,” and will do anything to protect them.</p>
<p>Such a contradictory understanding represents what feminist scholar Joan Scott described as a “corrective” to the problem of dismissing women’s perspectives that is so prevalent in traditional, positivist research. By making Lipoh’s experience visible the story challenges the normative construction of the trafficking victim and exposes the histories and realities that have previously been obscured, buried, stigmatized and marginalized, time and time again. </p>
<p>The musical seeks to shed light on the “story” currently being told about human trafficking—a story used by advocates to reinforce ideas of Western superiority on the global stage and moralisms about sex work in the developing world. This story is rooted in ideas about intimacy, rights, and women’s proper role in society. It also grapples with notions of modernization and colonialism. But most importantly, the story we tell about trafficking is <i>our </i>story.

</p><p><b>SYNOPSIS</b></p>
<p><i>Land of Smiles</i> is a new musical about the trafficking of women in Thailand, as seen through the eyes of sex workers, grassroots activists, NGO employees and other members of the anti-trafficking movement. Based on field research including over 50 interviews, <i>Land of Smiles</i> presents a dramatic look at how the story about trafficking is told, and shows that finding a solution to this problem is even more complicated than it seems.</p>
<p>The story focuses on the aftermath of a brothel raid in Chiang Rai, Northern Thailand. Lipoh, a young Kachin (ethnic minority) migrant from Burma, seems to be underage, making her an automatic “trafficking victim” in the eyes of the law. Emma Gable, an NGO case worker from Cedar Falls, Indiana is sent to prepare Lipoh to be a witness in a trial to prosecute her trafficker. Emma must convince Lipoh to be the person everyone sees: a trafficking victim. But Lipoh is unwilling to cooperate. She insists that she is eighteen, and was working in the brothel willingly. Not only that—she wants to go back.</p>
<p>What transpires is a journey into Thailand’s anti-trafficking movement—a world burdened with politics, morality and the rhetoric of human rights. Through hearing Lipoh’s story, Emma discovers that grave atrocities are being committed against the Kachin people of Burma. But these atrocities are overshadowed by a narrative about trafficking that serves the needs of the anti-trafficking movement, rather than the women it is trying to help.</p><p><br/></p>

The musical, which was written as part of USC Annenberg PhD student Erin Kamler’s dissertation project, “From Victim to Subject: Dramatization as Research in the Anti-Trafficking Space in Thailand,” has received additional support from the Wallis Annenberg Chair of Communication Technology and Society, the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism Doctoral Program, the USC Graduate School, the USC Center for Feminist Research, and the USC Diploma in Innovation program.</p>
<p><i>Land of Smiles</i> was also recently produced as a fully staged production at the Gate Theater Group in Chiangmai, Thailand, where it ran for four sold-out performances and received a standing ovation at every performance.

Audiences included members of the local Thai and ex-pat community and tourists from around the world. As the project was designed to be a platform for dialogue around the complex issues of trafficking and migration, the production team hosted migrant and NGO groups at each performance, followed by focus groups in which participants discussed the issues raised in the piece. In this way, the musical has already proven to be a successful vehicle for engaging the important, timely issues of the trafficking and migration of women, and serve as a launching point for dialogue among audiences.</p><p><br/></p>

A musical about the trafficking of women in Thailand


Here is a story that almost no one knows. In northern Burma, the army is systematically attacking and slaughtering ethnic minorities.  Some of these minority women migrate to Thailand and become sex workers to support their families and keep their people alive.  But American and European aid workers are putting these women in prison for being “victims.”  Land of Smiles will change everything you think you know about human trafficking.Many of you have already heard about Erin Kamler's Land of Smiles, a new musical about the complex issue of sex trafficking in Thailand. The musical just had a successful run of sold-out performances and standing ovations in Chiang Mai, Thailand and we are now working to raise funds for a production that will travel to the International Edinburgh Fringe Festival in August, 2014. The Edinburgh production will allow us the opportunity to expose the show to London critics, international audiences, and, we hope, garner respected festival awards. We are committed to international cultural diversity, so we are excited to be including a cast of actors from both the United States and Thailand.

The total amount needed for the Edinburgh production is $75,000. Here on Indiegogo, we hope to reach a goal of between $20,000-$50,000. But to do this, we need your help! Please join us and help make this production happen. Donate to our campaign and bring this powerful dramatic musical to a wide international audience and give it the recognition it deserves.  No amount is too small or too large. We sincerely appreciate your support!

All of our donors will have our eternal gratitude and thanks for supporting this project.  The money raised from this campaign will augment the support of our already committed investors.  If you would like more information on how to join our investment team, please contact us directly.  Our total budget of $75,000 will cover only our transportation, housing, and production costs-- no one gets paid.  Due to the importance of this story, all of our artists and production team are volunteering their time and talents to make this production happen.  

Thank you so much for your support in bringing Land of Smiles to a larger audience, and helping us tell a story that sheds light on the untold side of trafficking.WHAT AUDIENCES ARE SAYINGLOS ANGELES, USA“A unique, ambitious, extraordinary musical, about an ultimately heartbreaking subject.”      – Craig Bolotin, Screenwriter (Black Rain, Light it Up)“An important story and compelling musical...

ABOUT THE PROJECT

The musical is designed to serve as a platform for dialogue and awareness about human trafficking, a subject that has recently exploded onto the international stage as one of the most disturbing, complex and, many claim, pervasive issues of our time. Often dubbed “modern day slavery,” the focus of the movement that has sprung up to stop trafficking has been to “rescue” girls from situations of labor exploitation—specifically having to do with sex work. The problem with these tactics, and indeed, the entire movement to end human trafficking, is that often the most well intended of advocates do little to empower the women they are trying to “save.”
Land of Smiles responds to the crippled policies, practices and moralisms that underlie the anti-trafficking movement, by zooming in on Thailand and Burma, two countries in a region of the world known as an “infamous” trafficking hub. The story explores the way a U.S. funded non-governmental organization (NGO) responds to Lipoh, a young Kachin sex worker caught in the wrong brothel at the wrong time. Trying in earnest to “rescue” this exploited “victim,” the NGO relies on Lipoh’s victim status in order to secure the prosecution of her supposed “traffickers.” But as the narrative unfolds, we soon discover that Lipoh does not see herself as a voiceless, agency-less trafficking victim. Rather, she shares emotional, social, financial and political bonds with both her “carrier” – the woman who transported her from Burma into Thailand—and her “Mama San”-- the owner of the brothel where she worked. Far from experiencing her situation as oppressive, or akin to conditions of slavery, Lipoh finds strength in her relationships with her supposed “traffickers,” and will do anything to protect them.
Such a contradictory understanding represents what feminist scholar Joan Scott described as a “corrective” to the problem of dismissing women’s perspectives that is so prevalent in traditional, positivist research. By making Lipoh’s experience visible the story challenges the normative construction of the trafficking victim and exposes the histories and realities that have previously been obscured, buried, stigmatized and marginalized, time and time again. 
The musical seeks to shed light on the “story” currently being told about human trafficking—a story used by advocates to reinforce ideas of Western superiority on the global stage and moralisms about sex work in the developing world. This story is rooted in ideas about intimacy, rights, and women’s proper role in society. It also grapples with notions of modernization and colonialism. But most importantly, the story we tell about trafficking is our story. For it is our Western—indeed, American desire to rescue and prove ourselves “exceptional” on the world stage, that haunts us as a nation and as a culture. Unless we change these tropes, grapple with complexity, and embrace women in the developing world as our equals and our partners, the policies of the Western anti-trafficking movement will continue to fail.   
Land of Smiles represents the important values of free inquiry and risk-taking; values that form the core of any strong democratic society. The story engages the human experience of migration, and sheds light on under-represented communities and voices.
The strong support and warm reception from the international community, combined with the intellectual discussion and dialogue that Land of Smiles has generated thus far make us confident that this production will be of the highest caliber, providing audiences with a satisfying artistic experience while actively engaging thoughtful and important discussion.

I would love this opportunity to spread some of ""The Big Funny"" to the Big Sky Country (it just SOUNDS right, doesn't it?)With your help, I'll have the opportunity to be seen by agents, managers, producers, club owners and casting directors (can't you see me now, ""Harry and the Hendersons 2?"")I am asking for $650 for travel expenses. At the moment I'm typing this, a roundtrip plane ticket costs $450. It's probably already gone up. That's it, just a plane ticket. Coach. Hopefully exit row. PERKS - If you donate $5, you will receive a digital download of my CD, ""Funnier Than You Think.""  - If you donate $20 or more, I will record a personalized phone message for you in the voice of Redd Foxx, James Earl Jones, Bill Cosby or Louis Armstrong.  - For $100 I promise NOT to do the voice of Redd Foxx, James Earl Jones, Bill Cosby or Louis Armstrong around you for an entire MONTH. If you can't give anything, obviously I get it. However, if you could spread the word or post this on your Facebook for me, I'd be very grateful. Travis Simmons AKA ""The Big Funny""",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Based on her letters and stories, this exciting play is the definitive portrait of Mrs. F. Scott Fitzgerald:  the glamorous, fun loving, and tragic Zelda. As in ""The Bell of Amherst"", ""Lucifer's Child"", and ""Bronte"", Luce reveals the contradictions and mysteries of an extraordinary woman while fashioning a moving yet witty play.  Set in an insane asylum on the last day of Zelda's life, the play unfolds as a hypnotic session.  Zelda tells of her innocent rebellion as a southern belle, od her destructive marriage, and of her mental disintegration.



""A cry of the heart that relentlessly delivers the truth"" - The New York Times.


On a personal note, discovering Zelda was a life altering experience.  I discovered a woman so far ahead of her time, that her personal philosophies and view of life are still ground breaking for women 100 years later.  She remains an enigma to those who have studied the 1920's and the American ex-patriat movement.  Additionally, some believe that she was the actual author of many works attributed to her husband.


More of the world deserves to know this fascinating woman.

Producing a play takes a lot of collaboration and money.  The Red Door Theatre Company has always been committed to creating excellent theatre with integrity on a small budget.

<p>Thank you for visiting my fundraising page! Your support is greatly appreciated and will help me to successfully achieve one of my life long dreams...to create and perform in my very own dance show!</p>
<p>I have been involved in dance since I was a little girl, but began to realize the importance of dance in my life when I was in my teens. After high school, I continued my dance training at Ryerson University and absorbed as much as I could about this wonderful and expressive art form. I have had the pleasure to work with many choreographers, dance as an independent artist as well as a member of a few independent companies and collectives in Toronto.</p>
<p>I recently moved to Milton, a growing town, and found an amazing arts community here! I created a few projects that included not just dance, but multiple forms of art, and youth dancers, as Nutcase does as well. I believe that incorporating more then one form of art can help to expand your audiences experience and allow them to experience art at a deep level. This is what I hope to achieve through Nutcase.</p>
<p>Your support will help to provide adequate payment for all of those collaborators involved in Nutcase as well as additional needs such as costumes and advertising to name a few.</p>
By supporting Nutcase you are helping to show your support for the arts and recognizing the importance of the arts in our community and in our lives.</div>

<p>We have joined the Indiegogo bandwagon to bring you news of our latest show and to elicit your help with its funding!</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Our project:</span></p>
<p>We are bringing Euripides' <em><strong>The Bacchae</strong></em> to Montreal's famous Centaur Theatre, as this year's selection for their Brave New Looks program. Our own Joseph Shragge and Andreas Apergis have done another translation direct from the ancient Greek, just as they did with our award-winning production of <em>Medea</em> in 2010. Apergis will be directing a fantastic cast and brilliant design team, along with a chorus of beautiful voices who will bring Dionysus' ecstatic worshippers to life.</p>
<p>We are so excited to be mounting this famous greek tragedy that is considered one of the best of its time, yet is also difficult and rarely staged. We have a deep appreciation for this remarkable story and for the power of the artisits we have gathered. Our team is intensely commited and extremely talented, and our take on this story is unique.</p>
<p><span>The design for our version of the Bacchae will be inspired by the Second Great Awakening, an ecstatic religious revival that took place in a field in Cane Ridge, Kentucky in 1801. We chose this period of bacchanalian excess, drawing the link between Dionysian religion and ecstatic North American Christianity.</span></p>
<p>As everyone in theatre knows, it's tough to get funding, especialy lately. We we need to raise approximately $6500 in order to mount this production, which is scheduled to open <strong>October 12, 2012</strong> (closing October 20). It's an urgent situation we are in, so we are appealing to our friends, family, supporters, and to theatre lovers to help us create a piece of art.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">A bit about who we are:</span></p>
<p>Scapegoat Carnivale Theatre is an independent Montreal-based theatre company. We are interested in theatre that mixes classical, popular and experimental forms, employs heightened or poetic language and is expressionistic, unsettling or unreal. Our company is made up of artists whose mission it is to experiment with new methods and collaborate with artists and performers from diverse artistic and cultural traditions.</p>

<p>We need your contributions to make this production a reality, but we could also use your power to spread the good hellenic word. Like the frenzied female worshippers in the Bacchae, please go forth and tell everyone you know to check out our Indiegogo campaign and to come see the show!</p>

<p>Multi-disciplinary world premiere, <strong><em>You Need To Read Poetry!</em></strong> is a diverse cavalcade of over 40 American poets living and dead from 20<sup>th</sup> century to present--from Langston Hughes, Amiri Baraka, and Nikki Giovanni to Anne Waldman, Marge Piercy, Thom Gunn, Gary Soto and Lucia Perillo. Additionally, each performance includes a mini poetry slam or live reading, further highlighting a vibrant selection of local Bay Area poets.Curated and helmed by Artistic Director Scott Baker (himself a prize-winning, published poet),<em> You Need To Read Poetry! </em>opens at Bindlestiff Studio in San Francisco on November 30, 2012, running 12 shows through December 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2012.</p>
<p class=""p1"">Our ensemble (Shaye Acevedo, Rotimi Agbabiaka, Melvign Badiola, Geo Epsilanty, Valerie Fachman, Nazelah Jamison, Gloria McDonald, Gino Rose, and Carina Salazar) performs poetry in a wide variety of styles including storytelling, choral recitation, direct address, and dramatic scenes. We incorporate contact improvisation, interspersed with live and sound-tracked music, projected poems, documentary footage, and audience interactive segments like “the Explication Game” (dueling improvised explanations of classic and popular contemporary poems) and audience-created Exquisite Corpse poems.</p>
<p class=""p3"">Poetry allows us to share life’s most intimate moments (Childbirth, Love, Loss, Death, Illness) and its more public ones (War, Violence, Alienation, Celebrations) in ways ordinary language cannot capture.</p>

<p>To keep our theatre space alone costs $500 every month. To pay an understudy, an assistant director, and a live musician honoraria for their excellent work in rehearsal and performance, is about $500 <em>each</em>. This is the tip of the iceberg: the director, costume/prop designer, and managing director donate their work and much of their personal income towards productions. Recipients of a $4K Theatre Bay Area grant, we netted $800 in an independent benefit that took 2 months to organize. $20 full price tickets, $10 seniors/students/TBA members, 65-seat house, no one turned away for lack of funds.

<p>Everyone else will still be paid (maybe not as much, which is sad, as they’re not getting enough anyway.) We just won’t be able to tour this.

<p><em>Why read poetry? </em>As American literacy rates still declined in the past decade, we feel an obligation to produce theatrical events that bring literature to life. There is nothing like a great poem to distill a profound experience, to show a lifetime in a moment. A great poem creates a verbal/visual collage; it is the picture that paints a thousand words. We want to put poems in a physical and emotional context that reflects both the poet’s experience and era, and how those influenced where we are today. Without Langston Hughes, Gil Scott-Heron maybe never writes a poem. Without Gil Scott-Heron, Rap Music becomes something else. Without Ezra Pound, William Carlos Williams, T.S. Eliot and a myriad others never get a chance to publish; their poems are too different from the time. We don’t get the Imagists, who influenced the Surrealists, who influenced tons of rock musicians during the 60s.</p>

<p>Inspired by the literature of Samuel Beckett, PUS was formed in Chicago by writer/performers Scott Baker and Charles Pike. Recipients of Joseph Jefferson citations for theater work, they produced over 9 world premieres and original adaptations from 1991-99, including <em>Dead Soldier Walks Home</em>, Baker’s adaptation of Robinson Jeffers’ epic anti-war poem, and <em>Pound Bound</em>, commissioned for Chicago’s 2<sup>nd</sup> Rhinoceros Festival. Wired into a phone booth-sized cage, Baker portrayed Ezra Pound, recounting anecdotes of his life and poetry he composed while incarcerated in WWII Italy for fascism. Resurrected 2006 in San Francisco with Valerie Fachman, PUS has a growing ensemble of artistic associates including Geo Epsilanty and Sylvia Kratins, and continues to be praised for bare-bones productions of Samuel Beckett plays and original works. Previous Bay Area productions include the critically lauded <em>How To Love, Cancer Cells,</em> <em>Failure 2 Communicate, Mrs. Warren’s Profession</em>, <em>Sam I Am</em>, <em>Ghost Train Coming, tempestuous(ness) or HIStory Is Told by the Victor,</em> and<em> The Farmington Armada</em>. Baker assembled a program about the life of poet Richard Hugo with late veteran stage/screen actor Turk Muller, which held a pilot performance in 2011 at SF’s Bird &amp; Beckett Books and toured the Pacific Northwest, including Seattle’s Hugo House.</p>

<p> </p></div>","Multi-disciplinary world premiere, You Need To Read Poetry! is a diverse cavalcade of over 40 American poets living and dead from 20th century to present--from Langston Hughes, Amiri Baraka, and Nikki Giovanni to Anne Waldman, Marge Piercy, Thom Gunn, Gary Soto and Lucia Perillo. Additionally, each performance includes a mini poetry slam or live reading, further highlighting a vibrant selection of local Bay Area poets.Curated and helmed by Artistic Director Scott Baker (himself a prize-winning, published poet), You Need To Read Poetry! opens at Bindlestiff Studio in San Francisco on November 30, 2012, running 12 shows through December 23rd, 2012.
Our ensemble (Shaye Acevedo, Rotimi Agbabiaka, Melvign Badiola, Geo Epsilanty, Valerie Fachman, Nazelah Jamison, Gloria McDonald, Gino Rose, and Carina Salazar) performs poetry in a wide variety of styles including storytelling, choral recitation, direct address, and dramatic scenes. We incorporate contact improvisation, interspersed with live and sound-tracked music, projected poems, documentary footage, and audience interactive segments like “the Explication Game” (dueling improvised explanations of classic and popular contemporary poems) and audience-created Exquisite Corpse poems.
Poetry allows us to share life’s most intimate moments (Childbirth, Love, Loss, Death, Illness) and its more public ones (War, Violence, Alienation, Celebrations) in ways ordinary language cannot capture.
So much life is condensed into the several stanzas of a short poem. We attempt here to create a physical and synesthetic melding of movement, gesture, image, sound, perhaps even taste and smell, with our chosen poems. We draw a poet’s lines of influence, showing how their language and the compositions change the way we see things, how poems influence reality and, of course, the opposite. We live now in a society of sound bites. A poem can take the same space as a sound bite, but contain exponentially more worlds. Our goal is to bring those worlds to the audience.

<h3>The Renassiance Dueling Play has received a spot in a major theatre festival (the Midtown International Theatre Festival) and we are in need of funding to cover the initial cost.</h3>
<p>The show is a combining of a series of plays written by Michael Hagins that covers the history and legacy of dueling throughout the Renaissance period.  Maybe you've heard of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Duelist Code (part of C.A.G.E. Theatre's Night of Solitary, the Strawberry One-Act Festival and John Chatterton's One-Act Festival)</li>
<li>The Cavalier's Wife (part of C.A.G.E. Theatre's Night of Solitary and John Chatterton's One-Act Festival)</li>
<li>Wenches and Ale (part of C.A.G.E. Theatre's Night of Solitary, Shakespeare Saturday's Short Play readings, and Cupcake Readings)</li>
<li>The Decapitation of Thomas Kent (part of C.A.G.E. Theatre's Night of Solitary and Shakespeare Saturday's Short Play readings)</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, in a creative endeavor, I combined them into one full-length play of roughly 60-65 minutes, resulting in a comic journey throughout history tied together by an arrogant Spanish swordsman and his young, female assistant.</p>
<p>The money requested not only covers the entry fee into the festival ($998 to be exact) but covers rehearsal space, costume and weaponry repair, and the usual incidental costs that come with creating a show.  The show's budget is shockingly small, seeing as I own the costuming and weaponry, and the only set is a simple table and two chairs.  And if we don't get enough money in time for the festival, the money WILL go to putting up the show in its own space.  No matter what, the end goal is for the Renaissance Dueling Play to make its world premiere!</p>
<p>Please give whatever you can.  Even $1 would help!  (If all my Facebook friends gave me $1 I'd already be set!)  Not only would you make me happy but you'd make 12 artists would get to showcase their comic abilities and sword-fighting prowess to a large group of agents, managers, fellow artists and a whole array of new audience members!</p>
<p>We don't have a whole lot of time, so take a little time and donate a little something to the cause!</p>

Founded by Daniel Irizarry and Laura Butler Rivera, One-Eighth aims to bring out the physical extreme of the actor connected with the inner life of the character. Working with various artists from all parts of the world, One-Eighth was born of a hunger and a need, telling a story through the means of the actor, exploring the necessity of the human being, and examining the visceral connection of human nature. One-Eighth is a close up and an open shot to the micro and macro of Nature. Never in between.       </p>

But to be more specific here's my recipe: one ounce of 'Pataphysics, two spoons of Artaud's brain, three glasses of Jarry's favorite absinthe with his gun in hand, one pound of veggie Dada meat, Three hairs of Adam Szymkowicz's mangina, a little juice of futurist nectar, one quantum physics cat on Stephen Hawkins' lap while both swimming inside a black hole and collecting data, and finally 10 pounds of Japanese porn animation.

terraNOVA Collective, One-Eighth and IRT Theater are proud to announce the re-launch of UBU, the biggest grossing show of soloNOVA! Founded by Daniel Irizarry and Laura Butler Rivera, One-Eighth aims to bring out the physical extreme of the actor connected with the inner life of the character. Working with various artists from all parts of the world, One-Eighth was born of a hunger and a need, telling a story through the means of the actor, exploring the necessity of the human being, and examining the visceral connection of human nature. One-Eighth is a close up and an open shot to the micro and macro of Nature. Never in between.       
Written by acclaimed writer Adam Szymkowicz. The New York Times has called Adam Szymkowicz's plays ""sweet, sexy, neurotic friendly.....fabulously weird and weirdly fabulous....disturbing but touching.""
 
Directed and Performed by acclaimed artist Daniel Irizarry.

 
 ""...a monster of mammoth size and ravenous appetite, sort of like a tasmanian devil on steroids, by way of Monty Python's Mr. Creosote...""- -nytheatre.com by Martin Denton

 


‘…Irizarry’s singular stage presence and the productions beautifully grotesque little world make this…expanding universe worth a good look.’  -New York Theatre Review by Olivia Jane Smith

 
UBU is scheduled to open in New York at the IRT Theatre and will run from December 4th-16th.
 

UBU, inspired by Ubu Roi,  is the King of the Great Expanding Universe who will allow a privileged few into his mansion to watch him eat steak. Along the way, he may play music, read you poetry and tell of his lost loves and purchased politicians - it all depends on the mood of the King. A kinetic romp through the absurdist world of the most powerful CEO in the universe. 

UBU's creative team includes:

Your support will provide the means necessary to partially cover the period of rehearsals and production expenses such as artist’s fees for their time and expertise, acquisition of scenic material, and transportation fees. And, if we reach our goal we can give %10 to the Hurricane Sandy relief efforts

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Burlesque Classique is a modern-day traditional burlesque dance troupe directed by Lola Rose, who has the crazy idea that she would like to pay the dancers for their work. BC is presenting the Burlesque of Broadway for 7 shows at the Capital Fringe Festival.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We are asking for $3000 to pay for the Capital Fringe costs and to pay the dancers. The Capital Fringe Festival costs are $900. The rest of the money goes to 8 dancers.  If  the entire goal is not raised, the dancers will be paid first.</p>
<p>There are some great perks for donating – acknowledgement in the program, signed photos, tickets to future shows!</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>The dancers of Burlesque Classique show up to rehearsal each week after a long day of work only expecting to be paid a percentage of the tips collected at each show. We will not be collecting tips at the Fringe show. It would be great to be able to pay the dancers. They deserve it.</p>

<h3>Who I am, and What This Is About</h3>
<p>My name is Bethany Adams and I've been dancing since the age of 3. I started my training at the local recreation center. It was affordable and welcoming. As a teenager, I studied ballet at a pre-professional school. I discovered that ballet was my passion. I received a college scholarship where I danced full-time and performed in numerous productions. I knew I wanted to teach ballet. When I graduated in 2008, I started teaching at different studios.</p>
<p>Since 2010, I have been teaching at the same recreation center where I got my start. I love teaching at recreation centers because they reach a community that may not otherwise have had the means to enroll in a professional school. As their teacher, I also believe that high teaching standards should not be sacrificed based on location. That is why I find great satisfaction in bringing quality training to this community.</p>
<h3>What I Need aka Bottom Line</h3>
<p>Circumstances over the years have led me to divide my time between teaching and working for an unrelated industry. My goal is to make a career transition back to what I love the most: teaching. However, in order for me to engage my students physically and artistically, I need to be a commited student myself. </p>
<p><strong>Bottom line:</strong> Ballet training is expensive. When I cannot afford to fully participate in my art form, I feel like I'm not giving my students my best. Your funds will be allocated into two categories.</p>
<p>1) My personal training which includes classes and workshops. Your donation will allow me to train full-time with the best ballet schools in the metroplex. </p>
<p>2) A portion of the proceeds will go to a recital for my students in the summer of 2014. This includes costumes and production. All sponors are invited to attend. </p>
<p><span>The funds raised in this campaign are to be used for the 2013-2014 school year.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">The Impact</span></strong></p>
<p>Your support means the world to me and my students. Ballet as an art form can seem intimidating. It has been my personal mission to break down this ""fourth wall"" that encourages elitist attitudes and instead, promote equal opportunity for all. Recreation centers don't generally have the funding to produce an annual recital. Your donation will give me the training I need to become a better dancer and teacher, and give my students the chance to live their dream of performing.  </p>

<h3>Hi,</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Alexander Anderson and I would like to ask for your help. I am trying to attend a summer intensive overeas with a compnay called Nederlands Dans Theater in Holland. I was fortunate enough to recieve a full scholarship as well as a guest home for the duration of the program. The only problem is that I do not have the funds to fly overseas. It would mean the world to be given the opportunity to work and explore a territory outside my own.</p>
<p>The program begins on August 5th and ends August 17th</p>
<p>Tuition is € 950,-</p>
<p>Housing is € 364,-</p>
<p>Luckly I do not have to provide any funds to attend the program. My only request is finanical assistance for the flight to and from Holland :)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is a letter that explains why I feel so greatly about this program:</p>
<p align=""center""> </p>
<p>          I am excited to be accepted to the Nederlands Dans Theater summer course for the second time because of how much I learned from the program last summer. My reason for financial need stems from my family’s inability to support me financially. After my mother’s passing in 2007, I was moved into a family and was under legal guardianship until the age of 18. After which, I was classified as an independent with no ties of financial support except for health insurance. I have been to the Netherlands Danse Theater summer course before and while being there, I have gained an entirely new experience that has shaped my dancing to an extensive degree.</p>
<p>           I decided to audition for the Nederlands Dans Theater summer course last year because I wanted to grow. Not just grow, but to expand into the type of sponge that absorbed anything that was thrown in my direction. I needed that challenge. There is so much to say about the way dance has been represented in The States that I needed this route to see me through. I feel that the main value of this program was contributed by the company members who were able to teach the repertory with such maturity and grace. This program was more valuable than any other because I got to see the company members take pride in why they dance and why they love the art form. They allowed the students to make choices and feel like as though we were part of the work. I felt as if the course made me feel whole inside. I’m not quite sure how to put it. Whenever I entered the dance studio, I was happy and complete in whatever moment that was provided. As the course took off, I took off with it. I tried to stay total in every moment in order to keep myself focused and ready for the next challenge. I feel as though I have developed artistically and personally throughout this program; so much that I can still recall on all of the feedback that was given to me.</p>
<p>           I would be more than grateful for your financial support this year as I have never felt this way about a summer program before. I have never experienced a program such as this before and I feel that I can only benefit even more by going this year as it will be my final summer as a student at The Juilliard School. Looking for opportunities and expanding my knowledge is a vital component for my growth as a dancer and by attending the Nederlands Dans Theater summer course; I will be challenging myself in a brand new direction. I cannot voice loud enough my excitement for wanting to attend this year. I feel that because I am moving into my senior year at Juilliard, I believe that my exposure to the kind of movement and maturity of this environment is vital to the potential opportunities that can come my way. I am more than confident in saying that my desperation for attending this program would merely give me the route to successfully drive towards a dream that will soon hopefully become a reality.</p>
<p> Sincerely,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Alex </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Ever since I was 12, I have dreamed of being a professional dancer and choreographer. My training stems from a small hometown studio in Greenacres Florida, Alexander W. Dreyfoos Jr. High School in West Palm Beach, Florida and most recently The Juilliard School in New York City.</p>
<div> </div>
<p>In the video displayed are my choreographic expreiences as well as my own dancing. I hope you enjoy. This art form means more to me than anyone will ever know. This opportunity will not only allow me to attend this program; it will allow a hard working dancer the opportunity to expand his knowledge as well as make connections to the professional dance world in Europe. If I do not meet my goal, then everything that is earned will go directly back to you. Please help me attend this incredible program!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We have to move to a new studio space!  Caston Chamber Ballet Company and Caston's Ballet Academie have been blessed to be in a beautiful studio space with high ceilings, large sprung dance floors and floor-to-ceiling windows.  We have seen amazing growth in our dancers and created some beautiful new pieces here.  It has been our home for 5 and 1/2 years, but our landlord has other plans for this space so now it is on to a new adventure and we need your help.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The quality of our dance instruction is a hallmark of Caston Chamber Ballet and Caston's Ballet Academie.  Our dancers are known for their beautiful lines, feet and technique.  Like any athlete or artist, dancers need the right materials to work with.  Having large, marley-covered sprung floors, studios with high ceilings and large mirrors, and lots of natural lighting means our dancers have the best opportunity to grow and develop their skills and abilities.  Our marley-covered sprung floors are critical to ensuring dancers' feet and legs are protected from impact injuries.  We are proud to be one of only a few studios in St. Louis providing this specialized flooring.  Having a large studio with high ceilings is key for teaching stage-preparation and spacing, and lets us offer in-studio performances.  Observation windows allow families to watch their children grow and improve in their dance skills, a feature that families tell us they treasure.  These are essential elements for our new studio home.  </p>
<p>Relocating a dance studio can be an arduous and costly task. For Castons it will involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing all marley surfaces, sprung floors, mirrors, barres, and observation windows and reinstalling them in the new studio.  Buying and installing additional materials to compensate for the larger studio floors.</li>
<li>Removing the laminate flooring in the foyer of the current studio and reinstalling it in the new space. The purchase and installation of more laminate flooring and carpet to accommodate a bigger space.</li>
<li>Painting the new studio walls.</li>
</ul>
<p>The cost of the move and outfitting of the new studio is estimated between $5,000 and $8,000 to cover materials and essential moving-related expenses.  We will do most of the sweat-equity ourselves, along with friends, family, and our wonderful volunteers.</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Our organization's philosophy ""Ballet for EveryBody"" celebrates the belief that ballet encompasses an entire spectrum of performers and individuals.  An emphasis on each dancer's individual lifestyle, talents, and strengths ensures success and promotes self-confidence and personal growth within a positive environment.  Community outreach, with an emphasis on diversity among our dancers, our performances and our audiences, is central to who we are as a company and a school.</p>
<p>Caston's Ballet Academie was established in 2004 in Webster Groves, Missouri to provide exciting performance opportunities for dancers with a passion for ballet. Since our founding 13 years ago, our Company has doubled in size and increased in average age and skill level.  We have also established a successful Junior Company in recent years that is considered to be the best in St Louis! Just as we outgrew our original space in 2007, we now have the opportunity to move to a larger studio which will enable our continued growth and expansion in the St Louis community.  </p>
<p>Your support enables us to promote the art of ballet throughout St Louis, enriching the lives of all.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Your support means the world to us and will help ensure our continued growth and service to our community through the beauty of dance.  </p>
<p>Please help us to get the word out about this campaign, the Company and the Ballet Academie</p>

What We Need & What You Get


The quality of our dance instruction is a hallmark of Caston Chamber Ballet and Caston's Ballet Academie.  Our dancers are known for their beautiful lines, feet and technique.  Like any athlete or artist, dancers need the right materials to work with.  Having large, marley-covered sprung floors, studios with high ceilings and large mirrors, and lots of natural lighting means our dancers have the best opportunity to grow and develop their skills and abilities.  Our marley-covered sprung floors are critical to ensuring dancers' feet and legs are protected from impact injuries.  We are proud to be one of only a few studios in St. Louis providing this specialized flooring.  Having a large studio with high ceilings is key for teaching stage-preparation and spacing, and lets us offer in-studio performances.  Observation windows allow families to watch their children grow and improve in their dance skills, a feature that families tell us they treasure.  These are essential elements for our new studio home.  
Relocating a dance studio can be an arduous and costly task. For Castons it will involve:

Removing all marley surfaces, sprung floors, mirrors, barres, and observation windows and reinstalling them in the new studio.  Buying and installing additional materials to compensate for the larger studio floors.
Removing the laminate flooring in the foyer of the current studio and reinstalling it in the new space. The purchase and installation of more laminate flooring and carpet to accommodate a bigger space.
Painting the new studio walls.

The cost of the move and outfitting of the new studio is estimated between $5,000 and $8,000 to cover materials and essential moving-related expenses.  We will do most of the sweat-equity ourselves, along with friends, family, and our wonderful volunteers.



The Impact





Our organization's philosophy ""Ballet for EveryBody"" celebrates the belief that ballet encompasses an entire spectrum of performers and individuals.  An emphasis on each dancer's individual lifestyle, talents, and strengths ensures success and promotes self-confidence and personal growth within a positive environment.  Community outreach, with an emphasis on diversity among our dancers, our performances and our audiences, is central to who we are as a company and a school.
Caston's Ballet Academie was established in 2004 in Webster Groves, Missouri to provide exciting performance opportunities for dancers with a passion for ballet. Since our founding 13 years ago, our Company has doubled in size and increased in average age and skill level.  We have also established a successful Junior Company in recent years that is considered to be the best in St Louis! Just as we outgrew our original space in 2007, we now have the opportunity to move to a larger studio which will enable our continued growth and expansion in the St Louis community.  
Your support enables us to promote the art of ballet throughout St Louis, enriching the lives of all.
Other Ways You Can Help


Your support means the world to us and will help ensure our continued growth and service to our community through the beauty of dance.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Miss Julia is an international collaboration between renowned Colombian film and television actor Jhon Alex Toro, Australian international theatre artist Tina Mitchell, Colombian actress Gina Jaimes, and Italian Stage Director Lorenzo Montanini. This new adaptation by SITI Company's J.Ed Araiza brings together 5 artists from 4 different countries! In August, we will gather in Bogota, Colombia at Casa Ensamble to present the first fully staged realization of this bold and exciting venture.</p>
<p>Set in Colombia on Midsummer Eve, Miss Julia and her servant Juan have an encounter that will change their lives forever. As Juan tries to rise from the depths of his servile existence, Miss Julia wants to escape the bonds which tie her to a meaningless upper-class existence. The result is a power play of love, lust and a clash of classes which becomes violent and seemingly out of control.</p>
<p>This bi-lingual production, performed in English and Spanish, will be a clash of cultures, a dance of death combining heightened physicality and rich naturalistic text. This unique take on Strindberg's text makes Miss Julia as profound today as it was 100 years ago.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To make this international collaboration a reality we need to raise funds for the artists airfares to Colombia and production expenses. We have a number of exciting perks including personal cast photographs signed by the cast, audition coaching, sunset sailing cruises on the Hudson river and much much more. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our goal is to promote cultural exchange between Colombia, the US, Australia and Italy by presenting a classic piece of drama that is accessible to both Spanish and English speakers and to those who are not regular theatre goers. We also aim to attract the attention of international Festivals with the aim of touring the piece globally</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that not everyone has the means to make a contribution. Other invaluable ways in which people could help would be to share our campaign within your own social networks and if anyone living in Bogota has a spare room and can offer any of the international artists accommodation for their time in Colombia it would be a huge help! Thank you all so much.</p>

</h3>
<p>We are <a href=""http://www.perpetualvisitorstheatre.org/the-visitors.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Melissa and Kate</a>, and we tell real stories based on real events. In January 2015, we started <a href=""http://www.perpetualvisitorstheatre.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Perpetual Visitors Theatre Company LLC</a> to do just that. We believe in the power of storytelling to foster connection and in the power of theatre to spark conversation.</p>
<p>We're fascinated by that fact that the first question we always seem to ask one another is, ""What do you do?"" Are our jobs all others see of us? We just completed 40 interviews with people from all walks of life for our company's first full-length play about how what we do for a living shapes the rest of our lives. We asked them what they do, how they are perceived because of it, and what they value most in their lives.
</p>
<p>From these questions, people shared amazing stories -- about their dreams, about feeling invisible, about starting over, and about searching for employment and themselves. <span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>What began as a conversation

generation gaps, culture, identity, the definition of success, and 
ultimately what it means to both make a living and create a life.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span> <a href=""http://www.perpetualvisitorstheatre.org/shows-and-events.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Click here to read more about this play.</a><br/></p>
<p>We are eager to share these stories in Boston this October, but we can't do it alone. We are $1500 away from being able to produce a staged reading of our play, and we need your help to bring these stories to life.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need $1500 to help cover the cost of insurance and space rental for three performances this fall. Every dollar we get toward our goal helps to move these stories from 
the page to the stage! If we reach part but not all of our goal, we will still stage our show, but will limit the number of performances.</p>

</div></div>","Bringing Real Stories of Work and Life to the Stage

We are Melissa and Kate, and we tell real stories based on real events. In January 2015, we started The Perpetual Visitors Theatre Company LLC to do just that. We believe in the power of storytelling to foster connection and in the power of theatre to spark conversation.
We're fascinated by that fact that the first question we always seem to ask one another is, ""What do you do?"" Are our jobs all others see of us? We just completed 40 interviews with people from all walks of life for our company's first full-length play about how what we do for a living shapes the rest of our lives. We asked them what they do, how they are perceived because of it, and what they value most in their lives.

From these questions, people shared amazing stories -- about their dreams, about feeling invisible, about starting over, and about searching for employment and themselves. What began as a conversation 
about the work we do is woven into a larger story about economics, 
generation gaps, culture, identity, the definition of success, and 
ultimately what it means to both make a living and create a life. Click here to read more about this play.
We are eager to share these stories in Boston this October, but we can't do it alone. We are $1500 away from being able to produce a staged reading of our play, and we need your help to bring these stories to life.
  What We Need & What You Get We need $1500 to help cover the cost of insurance and space rental for three performances this fall. Every dollar we get toward our goal helps to move these stories from 
the page to the stage! If we reach part but not all of our goal, we will still stage our show, but will limit the number of performances.
With a $10 donation, you'll get a big thank you (on Facebook, Twitter, or our favorite, via snail mail. Supporter's choice.) For $25, you'll be listed as a supporter in the show's program. With a $50 donation, you'll get a free ticket to the show in October. And for $100, you'll get a signed copy of the script.

<p>The play we're taking up is called 'Can't Spell Right', and it's about witches in love. </p>
<p>Andrew and Lewis are two 20-year-old housemates. Only they're witches. Pretty powerful witches. But despite his magical talent, Andrew still has trouble wooing Nick. When he and Lewis try to summon Gazerath, the Spirit of Love to help Andrew win Nick's heart, they accidentally summon the flamboyant Gazra, the Spirit Queen of Sickness and Health. Andrew's plans to woo Nick go hilariously awry in this comedy of errors that features magic, spirits and a colourful cast. And like anything involving magic, absolutely anything can happen.</p>
<p>The theatre company and cast are student run, and while this may sound off putting, 'Can't Spell Right' is going to be our first step into the professional theatre world, and we want it to be the best it can possibly be. Your contributions to our campaign will be an incredible help.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The funding will go towards helping pay for our venue deposit and towards our advertising costs.

The money we raise here will help us advertise our show, print out program copies, fliers and posters, and get in as large an audience as possible. It will also go to help paying the larger of two deposits our production is required to pay for by the hosting venue.</p>
<p>As an upcoming theatre company, we don't have many perks to offer our funders, but we can guarantee you credit in our programmes, signed copies of our posters and DVD copies of our filmed performance. For our larger contributors, we'll also change a character's name to one of your choosing, within reason.</p>
<p>We've picked the flexibility payment method, so even if we don't reach our target funds, we'll use as much money as possible towards paying our costs while still aim to reward our funders. </p>

Since our inception in 2012, IRTE has received increased recognition from the downtown New York theater community and the national improvisation scene.  We love what we do. And we love to share what we do not only with an ever-growing audience, but also with our fellow artists. To that end we are delighted to share performance opportunities with other artists by hosting musical guests and inviting guest improvisers to join us for our shows. Your donations help us not only mount a successful new season but also enable us to continue to develop this artistic community as we move closer to our long-term mission of a fully sustainable professional improvisational theater company with a year-round season and a permanent home; thus bringing improvisation to a broader theater-going audience.We are so grateful for the impact our donors had on our 2015 season and for everyone who came out to see our shows, and we can't wait to get even bigger and better as we create a completely new season in 2016!

THE PLAY
A transgender entertainer named Tammy  takes the audience on a journey into a looking glass of  gender identity. Incongruence: A {trans} Gender Looking Glass, is about the other, or the misfit, whether seen or sensed,  that is reflected in anyone’s mirror.  Tammy's imaginative looking glass memoir weaves itself thru transgender related stories that are provocative, emotionally witty and gritty.  Public interest in transgender has grown and, as it has been recently noted on the cover of Time Magazine with Laverne Cox,  we are at a ""Transgender Tipping Point"" in terms of social consciousness .  Our play offers  a wonderful  opportunity to help build awareness for the issues relating to gender identity and gender non-conformity.  It  presents a compelling look into the lives of transgender women and men from a non-satirical point of view and, perhaps,  a shockingly relatable experience for anyone new to the topic and its exploration. 

THE PLAY'S HISTORY


Incongruence was written by first time playwright, Carla Pridgen.  It premiered in Asheville, NC at 35Below (ACT) and was produced by  Different Strokes Performing Arts Collective,  Directed  by C.J Breland.  Stephanie Hickling Beckman is the company's Artistic Director.   
The individual stories in the play were taken from over twenty-five interviews of a diverse cross-section of transgender experience, including parents, siblings, partners, friends — and of course out of  the playwright's  transgender life experience.  These stories were fictionalized and in many cases blended to make a play of interwoven plot lines developed from a treasury of transgender memoir.  
THE PLAY TODAY
Following the play’s world premiere, June 2013,  Ms. Pridgen assigned the rights to Incongruence  to her son, Will Pridgen. (It will not surprise you that Will calls his father, Carla, ""Dad""-- publicly.  Carla is cool with that! Well, this will not surprise you AFTER you get to know them!)  As an activist adult child of a transgender parent, Will took his play to New York and to his good friends, Audrey and Bobby Alford, with IVY Theatre Company.  After reading Incongruence,  Mrs. Alford, Founding Member of the company and now Director of Incongruence  said, ""This play has potential!""  With good guidance from Audrey, Carla has rewritten the play, and  Mr. Pridgen and Mr. Alford are now co-producing: Incongruence: A {trans} Gender Looking Glass.  

Ivy Theatre Company has begun a new annual venture with the inaugual production of the Trellis Project.   The good folk at Ivy describe it nicely as ""a page to stage partnership giving badass playwrights the structure to climb beyond the antiquated hierarchy of commercialism to change the conversation.""  We are honored and pleased to be one of the two plays,  with badass, et.al., to be first on The Trellis that is Ivy Theatre! 

To extend this metaphor, this fall  the branches of Incongruence  grew onto the trellis when The 4th Street Theatre, the black box theatre of The New York Theatre Workshop was booked,  the show was cast and production team formed. Carla went to the first rehearsal to meet the cast as a whole, and some individually.  She was there  to hear the play read,  to share the story of the play's development  and something of her journey too.  She did not feel a stranger, not in the least.

INCONGRUENCE LOOKING FORWARD
Of the play’s first production, key words from the Asheville Citizen-Times review were:  
powerful…  lyrical…  passionate… forceful and moving…  sensitive… veritable showcase of varieties. 
We believe  Incongruence will be those things again and  more refined by the New York experience.  It will not be without light moments and good comedy.  It will be an emotional roller coaster of entertainment.  We certainly  believe it is a fresh approach to an issue of human diversity too often  made trivial and  sensationalized.   There is something for anyone brave enough to pay attention and peer into the looking glass that is, INCONGRUENCE.  
   Taking the MIS out of the FIT!  

Where do you fit into this story?   


In  the New York production  nearly 40% of the expense will go to performance space (We are so fortunate... IVY has its own rehearsal space!), approximately 12% will go to actors and 18% for production and design staff. The remaining 30% not only provides the set, costumes and props, but pays for all marketing and  press, including web and funding services.  

The team for this campaign with Cast and Company asks for and appreciates your financial  support: small or large or something in between.
 WHAT'S FITTING SO FAR!
 
A generous donor has stepped up and promised to match every dollar given, dollar-for-dollar, up to $2500. This will double the first $2500 dollars given! So that is potentially half the campaign right from the start! Now that's a fit!
We boldly (if not humbly) ask other potential donors of exemplary means to follow the afore mentioned  be... fitting example.
Of course please note the PERKS to the right of your screen. Any of these make your fit?
One way you can certainly help is spread the word.  That would be very fitting indeed.  FaceBook, Twitter, emails... be bold, go old school and do the town crier bit...  ""Oh Yea, Oh Yea!"" (Talk about misfit!)  A better fit is found using the Indiegogo share tools! Oh yeah!
Your imagination. Let us know your ideas. We'll be adding them right here.

<p>For centuries, The Scottish Play has proved to be one of the most popular of Shakespeare’s tragedies.

</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the last 5 years, Poor Richard's Players has 
been producing important, challenging, fun, and award winning theatre 
throughout Las Vegas.  We were voted the ""Best"" at the Las Vegas Fringe 
Festival three years in a row.  At the inaugural Valley Theatre Awards, 
we won Best Production, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Sound Design
 for our production of RED by John Logan.  Some of our other 
accomplishments include ""Best of 2013"" by Las Vegas Weekly, ""Best of 
2012"" by CityLife Magazine, multiple nominations from the Review 
Journal's Best of Las Vegas, and Downtown Zen said, ""Poor Richard's 
Players is the future.""  Well, the future looks bright for us as we move
 on to our next big challenge.  A challenge that we want you to be a 
part of.  It is time for us to open our own theatre!</p>
<p>It is difficult being a gypsy theatre company, moving from venue to venue, not knowing where our next show will be, and producing theatre in other companies' venues comes with its own obstacles.  We want to produce bigger and better shows deserving of our audience.  With a little help from you, we can make that happen.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>We need to raise $15,000 towards converting and opening Poor Richard's Playhouse, our new venue.  Every little bit helps toward theater staples such as chairs, drapery, audio/visual equipment, and future show production costs.  This will ensure that our shows are offering the very best in Theatre technology. We hope to open by August 2015.<br/><br/>
<p>We are offering great perks for the Theatre-going audience, including tickets to our Opening Season shows that will feature some of the best productions by Poor Richard's Players:  5 Lesbians Eating a Quiche, The Bible: The Complete Word of God (Abridged), and Dick Johnson: Private Eye.  For those that are feeling more generous, we are also offering a permanent fixture in our facility to commemorate your contribution to PRP.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> </div><h3>The Impact</h3><div>The local Theatre community is growing strong.  Poor Richard's Players has played a part in that growth and we want to keep providing the quality live Theatre experience that Las Vegas has come to expect from its producers.  Poor Richard's Playhouse will also host other Theatre and arts companies, as well as feature classes and workshops in a variety of performing arts including acting, writing, improv and musical improv, and more.</div><div>Also, as the hosts of The LVTAP Show (a local theatre podcast), The PRP Team will be implementing a fully functional recording studio to suit both the needs of the podcast as well as the sound design and studio recording needs of the theatre community.<br/>
</div>
<div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>There is no proper reward without a little risk.  We cannot open Poor Richard's Playhouse without the support of friends, family, and the Theatre community.  If we don't make our goal, we may not be able open on our expected start date.  It will take a lot more than just our own family and friends to support this campaign.  But we are determined to make this a reality and we know we can do it with everyone's help.<br/>

studios are in a heated battle for survival when their opposing leading men,
 Lance Grant and Hoyt Baxter, fall in love.  Reminiscent of screwball
comedies of the past, this tuneful new musical tells the story of two movie
stars who suddenly find themselves having to navigate a dizzying world of
artifice, backstabbing, lavender weddings, double-crossing starlets, and a
moral crusader from the Legion of Rectitude, making it increasingly more
difficult to hold on to the one real thing each has ever found.</p>

<p>The show runs for five weeks only, this August, at the NoHo Arts Center.</p>
<p>If you buy your ticket in advance, as part of our pre-sales
campaign, you’ll save almost 30%!  For

<p><b>Who are we?</b></p>
<p>""The Max Factor Factor"" was developed by the New
Musicals Initiative for Celebration Theatre over the past couple of seasons and
now that Celebration has moved out of its theatre, we're stepping in to produce
this wonderful new musical this summer at the NoHo Arts Center in North
Hollywood, CA. And Celebration's own Michael Shepperd is at the helm as director!<br/></p>

goal, you'll still be able to get your tickets for $24 instead of $34.</p>
<p><b>WHY THIS MUSICAL?</b></p>
<p>We love this musical.  It's fun, tuneful, fast-paced
(VERY fast-paced in spots!), and it has a warm message of hope handed down to
us from silenced movie actors in the 1930's. </p>
<p>We've workshopped this musical from its very earliest days,
when it was only an idea in the minds of the producers at the Celebration
Theatre, through the enthusiastic and thorough first draft, to the
heart-stopping, spontaneous performance during Stages Musical Theatre Festival
in 2013, to its current state of musical theatre perfection. The Max

barriers to avenge the raped women of Bogota.  Based on the true story of a
group of female inmates selected every year as beauty queen contestants at the
Buen Pastor prison, this new play interweaves the ritualistic journey of a “parade
of prisoners” with Colombia’s social, political, and spiritual history. 
Your
generous contribution will directly fund this ambitious and socially relevant
undertaking.  All money from this campaign will be used to purchase
production materials and offer a modest stipend to the incredibly talented
artists that have dedicated their craft to fully realizing this dramatically
poetic undertaking.  Simply put, every single dollar donated directly
impacts and enhances our ability to present a polished and professional
premiere workshop production.

The

presented as part of the New Plays Now festival taking place at the
Pershing Square Signature Center in New York City April 2015.  But in
order to achieve the vision of this play from the page to the stage we need
your support!

is the artistic director and master teacher of Deena Levy Theatre Studio -
where she has been teaching and directing actors how to “unlock the secrets”
for 23 years.


Introducing:
The Deena Levy Theatre Studio



“The person you truly are is a thousand
times more interesting than any character you could ever play.” - Constantin
Stanislavski


The Deena Levy Theatre Studio is known for giving some of the best
performance showcases in New
York City, hands-down. Some of the actors who have studied at DLTS are Channing Tatum (Foxcatcher,
21 Jump Street), Juliana Margulies (The Good Wife), Kim Dickens (Gone Girl,
Treme), Mark Valley (Crisis, Body of Proof).
Over the
last 15 years DLTS has
produced four themed original plays that celebrate the actor as
writer/performer:
Child’s
Play, Small Circle of
Friends (Kim Dickens/Mark Valley), You/Actor
(documentary aired on Bravo & film festivals), New York/Solo (a highly acclaimed ode to 9/11).



Why “My Technology?” 
“My technology” is a funny production
that is dangerously relevant. We
are not going to spend all of our time lambasting the evils of Facebook
addiction, or the fact
that the quick fix of Internet porn is threatening to destroy true intimacy and make it a thing of the past. There are two sides to every story and this will glorify technology and its
virtues - just a little.
Today,
everything is technology, but something is lost. The theme is about getting back to who we are as human
beings through ten very
personal, poignant and sexy pieces.
""Technology is so amazing, it’s
ruining my life.”
What?







The
design of the piece is an interactive
multi media production that combines entertaining, raw, and truthful
stories and original music with
some hardcore technological surprises to illustrate the point.
The aim is to raise $15,000+.
We are
humbly grateful for any amount of money you can contribute to our production. Of course we are determined to reach our goal and beyond as the cost of production in New York City is growing. Each and every penny will be accounted for as the production expands.

<p>Hello my name is Corky Dominguez this summer 2012 I have the unique opportunity to study theater in Italy, in the Veneto region and more specifically within the historic city centre of Padua. For me, the opportunity to do any study abroad seems so far fetched. I work part time as a theatre teacher and as an independent theatre artist looking for work wherever I can. With these economic times being what they are, it is a constant struggle, challenge and I barley get by. But, being where I am in my life and career I have a strong conviction, a desire, and a gut feeling that “The Body Of Mask” program in Italy is exactly what I need to strengthen my knowledge and understanding of the world of masks as a theatre director, theatre artist and theatre educator. I am starting this campaign to raise the necessary funds to make this trip happen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE PROGRAM</strong></p>
<p>The dates are July 22 - August 5, 2012. This is an advance hands-on theatre program, that addresses performers, theater teachers, directors, playwrights, designers, choreographers, and musicians wanting to expand their creative tools or wishing to further their experience with physical theater approaches to artistic creation. This journey is not a method, but more importantly a provocation that gives meaning to an individual’s artistic path; it is not just an approach to training actors, but of educating theatre artists with very diverse skill sets.</p>
<p><br/> The program’s approach works toward the teaching of the theater arts as a communal and collaborative experience where each collaborator participates in many aspects of theatre: playwriting, directing, performing, and design. At the same time, the program offers a unique physical experience that challenges the participants to develop their body as a complete instrument. There will be a daily training regimen focused on: voice, spatial awareness, engagement in improvisation, levels of playing and the development of strong working relationships with the audience and the creative ensemble.</p>
<p><br/> By experimenting and creating theater in new ways, participants will gain new tools to use in their own teaching and directing work: from text-based stage work and approaches to film performance, to original theater creation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>PERSONAL INTEREST AND GOALS</strong></p>
<p>I am extremely interested in my continued experiences with masks in the theatrical field. I had basic training with mask workshops in my studies several years back. I’ve been afforded the opportunity to take what I’ve learned from those workshops along with my background in movement to explore the process of basic neutral mask work. As a play director I have incorporated masks in several productions I’ve directed as well as in my work as a solo performer. I’ve also built and created masks using plaster strips and paper products.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My goal is to bring back to my local and artistic communities the knowledge and information learned by teaching workshops to youth and adults. In addition, I am working with playwright, Josefina Lopez, on a theatre piece I will be directing at the end of this year at CASA 0101 Theater located in a predominately Latino community just east of downtown LA. The title of the play is “Piñata Dreams” about a young boy and his connection with his family and their business of making piñatas. Within the play there is the character of the grandmother who makes and creates “alebrijes”. Alebrijes are multi-colored, almost psychedelic colored creatures that are magical and surreal. I think masks will lend itself perfectly in this play. So the plan is to incorporate my basic mask knowledge along with what I will be learning and experiencing from this summer’s program towards this production.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>PLEASE SUPPORT BY MAKING A FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION</strong></p>
<p>For some reason masks fell onto my lap and I have since embraced this art form, it has become my passion. I know without a doubt that my experience in Italy will be most inspirational, give me additional tools, will open my eyes, and give me a solid foundation to continue building my work with masks. I will only benefit from a program like this while working and learning from the skilled instructors, and on top of all this, to be able to experience the rich history, tradition and culture of masks and Italy. This will most definitely be a dream come true.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you have the means to contributed and donate funds know that your support will be put to good use and will be extremely appreciated. Spread the word let others know about my campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you for your time and generosity!</p>

 The program’s approach works toward the teaching of the theater arts as a communal and collaborative experience where each collaborator participates in many aspects of theatre: playwriting, directing, performing, and design. At the same time, the program offers a unique physical experience that challenges the participants to develop their body as a complete instrument. There will be a daily training regimen focused on: voice, spatial awareness, engagement in improvisation, levels of playing and the development of strong working relationships with the audience and the creative ensemble.
 By experimenting and creating theater in new ways, participants will gain new tools to use in their own teaching and directing work: from text-based stage work and approaches to film performance, to original theater creation.
 
 
PERSONAL INTEREST AND GOALS
I am extremely interested in my continued experiences with masks in the theatrical field. I had basic training with mask workshops in my studies several years back. I’ve been afforded the opportunity to take what I’ve learned from those workshops along with my background in movement to explore the process of basic neutral mask work. As a play director I have incorporated masks in several productions I’ve directed as well as in my work as a solo performer. I’ve also built and created masks using plaster strips and paper products.
 
My goal is to bring back to my local and artistic communities the knowledge and information learned by teaching workshops to youth and adults. In addition, I am working with playwright, Josefina Lopez, on a theatre piece I will be directing at the end of this year at CASA 0101 Theater located in a predominately Latino community just east of downtown LA. The title of the play is “Piñata Dreams” about a young boy and his connection with his family and their business of making piñatas. Within the play there is the character of the grandmother who makes and creates “alebrijes”. Alebrijes are multi-colored, almost psychedelic colored creatures that are magical and surreal. I think masks will lend itself perfectly in this play. So the plan is to incorporate my basic mask knowledge along with what I will be learning and experiencing from this summer’s program towards this production.
 
PLEASE SUPPORT BY MAKING A FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION
For some reason masks fell onto my lap and I have since embraced this art form, it has become my passion. I know without a doubt that my experience in Italy will be most inspirational, give me additional tools, will open my eyes, and give me a solid foundation to continue building my work with masks. I will only benefit from a program like this while working and learning from the skilled instructors, and on top of all this, to be able to experience the rich history, tradition and culture of masks and Italy. This will most definitely be a dream come true.
 
If you have the means to contributed and donate funds know that your support will be put to good use and will be extremely appreciated. Spread the word let others know about my campaign.
 
Thank you for your time and generosity!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Coronde' Ware and I am producer/actor/playwright.  Back in 2009 there was a conversation between me, my wife, and my brother.  We all love music and my wife loves dance.  So we came up with the idea of a play that tells a story through song, but it is expressed through dance.  This lead to the production, ""I Tune into Love"".  I feel we are creating a new genre here, and I call it a ""dancical"" production.  In October 2009, we had our premiere and we got rave reviews from our audience.  The most amazing comment was from a couple that stated, ""this is something I have never seen, and this belongs on Broadway"".  We're planning on making this production bigger and better, and we need your help to make this a success.  Our next production will be in October 2011.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We're looking to raise $10,000 for the production of ""I Tune into Love"".  All the money donated will go towards paying for rehearsal space, the venue, the dancers, costumes, and marketing.  In the past productions we paid for all the production costs out of pocket.  In order for us to stay within our budget we had to ask people for a lot of favors, and individuals took lower pay for the production to go on.  We would like to change that this time and pay everyone what they are worth. If we do not reach out goal of $10,000 we will continue to press on and still have the show in October of this year.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Also we have some perks so please check them out!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<em>This is Not a Pipe Dream</em> is a play for young audiences based on the childhood of surrealist artist René Magritte. This inspiring show takes its viewers on a touching and whimsical journey through art, theatre, and life.  </li>

<h3><strong>The Story</strong></h3>
<p><em>This is Not a Pipe Dream</em><span> is based on the life and work of surrealist artist Rene Magritte, and is a whimsical celebration of art, imagination, and the mysteries of life. The play follows the young Magritte, a boy who wants to be an artist against his father's will, as he learns to express himself and question the world around him. In the spirit of his artwork, this story brings magic, slapstick comedy, and Magritte’s own beloved images to the stage as it tumbles through his life. </span><em>This is Not a Pipe Dream</em><span> is about finding your own unique mode of expression and finding joy and beauty in the unknown.</span></p>

This is Not a Pipe Dream is a play for young audiences based on the childhood of surrealist artist René Magritte. This inspiring show takes its viewers on a touching and whimsical journey through art, theatre, and life.  
Northwestern University's Purple Crayon Players is so excited to bring this wonderful play to campus this November!
Written by Barry Kornhauser, Produced by Sally Lindel, Directed by Meg Lowey

The Story
This is Not a Pipe Dream is based on the life and work of surrealist artist Rene Magritte, and is a whimsical celebration of art, imagination, and the mysteries of life. The play follows the young Magritte, a boy who wants to be an artist against his father's will, as he learns to express himself and question the world around him. In the spirit of his artwork, this story brings magic, slapstick comedy, and Magritte’s own beloved images to the stage as it tumbles through his life. This is Not a Pipe Dream is about finding your own unique mode of expression and finding joy and beauty in the unknown.
Purple Crayon Players
The Purple Crayon Players is a student-run theatre company on the Northwestern University campus committed to creating high quality productions, events, and educational materials regarding all aspects of theatre for young audiences. Purple Crayon Players believes that audience of all ages can appreciate, be inspired by, and grow through exposure to this unique art form.
Furthermore, we understand the importance of training the future leaders of the TYA field, and strive to provide Northwestern University students with opportunities to direct, produce, design, perform, teach, and explore new ways of expanding the field both on campus and at large.

significa ""obbligato a muovere"". Negli scacchi si riferisce alla

<p><i>Zugzwang</i> è uno spettacolo in cui quattro personaggi alla
deriva, esibendosi in una serie di attrazioni, si raccontano attraverso diversi
linguaggi  - la danza, la musica, il
comico, il teatro di figura -  nel
contesto decadente e ironico di un dark cabaret. <b><span>E’ l’allegoria di una realtà che
racchiude in sé la scandalosa necessità di stupire per esistere, in
un’accozzaglia di performance che servono solo a sopravvivere con
fatica.</span> </b></p>
<p>C’è
una dimensione unica, una sorta di posto segreto che vive intorno al teatro ed
è inafferrabile come la risposta a una domanda senza senso. È proprio lì che ci
porta <i>Zugzwang</i>: siamo spettatori di
eventi che solitamente sono negati ai nostri occhi. Per una volta ci è concesso
il privilegio di guardare oltre e incontrare frammenti di un esistere che c’è,
è concreto ma visibile solo nelle conseguenze del suo essere.</p>
<p>L’Attesa,
il Potere, la Vita e la Morte danzano sullo sfondo decadente e impolverato di
un Teatro deserto. Ed in questo luogo incontriamo quel che resta. Quel che
resta dopo le luci della ribalta, dopo gli applausi, dopo il sipario.</p>
<p>Obbligati
a muoversi sulla scacchiera dell’esistenza pur sapendo che ogni passo conduce
ad una inevitabile sconfitta. Quel che conta è esserci e restare legati anche ad un solo filo,

Chi siamoArtisti Aquilani onlus nasce nel 2009 per unire artisti capaci di indagare la realtà attraverso le arti performative
e di unire la passione alla professione. In questi anni la ricerca dei contenuti e quella formale sono andate di pari passo,
realizzando progetti sociali e artistici  che hanno coinvolto sia il
nostro territorio sia territori
oltreconfine.Siamo fieri costruttori
autofinanziati del primo spazio teatrale, rinato a L’Aquila dopo il terremoto
- La casa del Teatro - che teniamo
in vita attraverso rassegne, festival, corsi, conferenze, seminari.Il nostro
lavoro è interamente autoprodotto.
Non siamo sostenuti da alcun Ente o Ministero e riusciamo a sopravvivere grazie
al sostegno del pubblico oltre che alla nostra tenacia.Le nostre
peculiarità sono la versatilità - un
mix di tecniche e tradizioni artistiche (dal clown alla danza classica Indiana)
- e il bisogno di far dialogare la formazione permanente e il lavoro con la vita e la storia.http://www.artistiaquilani.it/

ZugzwangIn tedesco
significa ""obbligato a muovere"". Negli scacchi si riferisce alla
situazione in cui un giocatore si trova in difficoltà perché qualsiasi mossa
faccia, è costretto a subire lo scacco matto oppure una grossa perdita di
materiale.
Zugzwang è uno spettacolo in cui quattro personaggi alla
deriva, esibendosi in una serie di attrazioni, si raccontano attraverso diversi
linguaggi  - la danza, la musica, il
comico, il teatro di figura -  nel
contesto decadente e ironico di un dark cabaret. E’ l’allegoria di una realtà che
racchiude in sé la scandalosa necessità di stupire per esistere, in
un’accozzaglia di performance che servono solo a sopravvivere con
fatica. 
C’è
una dimensione unica, una sorta di posto segreto che vive intorno al teatro ed
è inafferrabile come la risposta a una domanda senza senso. È proprio lì che ci
porta Zugzwang: siamo spettatori di
eventi che solitamente sono negati ai nostri occhi. Per una volta ci è concesso
il privilegio di guardare oltre e incontrare frammenti di un esistere che c’è,
è concreto ma visibile solo nelle conseguenze del suo essere.
L’Attesa,
il Potere, la Vita e la Morte danzano sullo sfondo decadente e impolverato di
un Teatro deserto. Ed in questo luogo incontriamo quel che resta. Quel che
resta dopo le luci della ribalta, dopo gli applausi, dopo il sipario.
Obbligati
a muoversi sulla scacchiera dell’esistenza pur sapendo che ogni passo conduce
ad una inevitabile sconfitta. Quel che conta è esserci e restare legati anche ad un solo filo,
invisibile forse, ma ancora capace di sostenere il volo.

Perché il crowdfunding
Abbiamo scelto il crowdfunding  perché è una pratica di
micro-finanziamento che parte dal basso (come il nostro teatro) e che mobilita
le persone oltrepassando le barriere tradizionali dell'investimento
finanziario. 

5 buoni motivi per sostenere Zugzwang
1.  Per rispondere creativamente al cambiamento che
sta avvenendo nel mondo culturale italiano.
2.  Perchè avete sempre pensato che il teatro e la
musica siano una cosa meravigliosa ma non avete mai potuto dedicarvi a questa
passione e per poter dire agli altri e a voi stessi : questo l’ho fatto anche
io!
3.  Perchè pensate sia una modalità intelligente,
efficace e innovativa per promuovere la cultura
4.  Perchè vi piace dare fiducia ai giovani e
credete che con la cultura si può mangiare ma anche vivere meglio per sè e per
gli altri.
5.  Per avere su questa terra sei persone che vi
saranno grate per sempre e parleranno sempre bene di voi!

<p><b></b></p><b>Why is the Piñata so
interesting? Where did it come from? How does it reflect life?</b><p></p>
<p>The Piñata holds ancient and contemporary implications of
celebration, loss and regeneration for Latina/o culture and the world at large. 
Originally, before it was the paper mache sculpture filled with candy that
children smash open with a blindfold and stick, the Piñata was birthed in China
as a New Year celebration and a ritual for planting. During his travels in
China, Marco Polo gathered it up and brought it back to Italy where it was
appropriated to Catholicism representing 7 deadly sins. From Italy it swung to
the Spaniards who colonized Mexico.  The Aztecs had their own ritual
during the winter solstice that included the breaking open of a clay pot filled
with water as a prayer for the return of the Sun God, “Huitzilopochtli”-which
translates as “Hummingbird on the Left”. In essence, it was a prayer for
sustainability which is relevant for our precarious world today.  Now, La
Piñata is used for many occasions including birthday parties which personalizes
the game, singing “Dale Dale Dale, no pierdas el tino, porque si lo pierdes,
pierdes el camino…”(Hit it Hit it Hit it, don’t lose your aim, if you lose it,
you lose your way”). La piñata is a survivor and a symbol for creativity that confronts
centuries of pain and confusion to release old paradigms and bring communities
together through the beauty of art and re-story telling. Also, the Piñata is
not limited to paper mache Sponge Bobs and Explora Doras. It is a ritual for
growth and can be an embodied meditation on regeneration.</p>
<p>The work I am showing on May 4<sup>th</sup>,
is a work in progress for a future full-length production called “<i>Piñatas Spaghetti and Lace</i>”. It’s very exciting because I am collaborating
with traditional Chinese dancers, an Aztec dancer, plus 6 contemporary dancers
and musicians who will take the audience on a visual and musical journey through
the history of La Piñata.<span>  We will also give
the audience an option to participate in a blindfolded exploration and other
interesting surprises at Shawl Anderson. In addition, I
will be choreographing part of Piñata with dance students at Cal State
University East Bay this Spring. After I
return from Mexico, I have a few images of various piñatas in my head to paint
and I plan to incorporate an aerial piece in a future production.  I am presently seeking a venue and funding to
hire a production manager to produce the full-length show and will continue to offer
Piñata Breakthrough performance labs “What do you want to breakthrough in your
life right now?  What will you sacrifice
to get to the goodies on the inside? In 2015, I plan to curate a show with the
theme of Piñata that celebrates other choreographers of the Latina/o diaspora.</span></p>

<h3>Ben &amp; Rita <br/>
</h3>
<p>a romantic-comedy<br/>by Wendy-Marie Martin<br/></p>
<p><i>Sometimes fate lives right next door.</i><br/><br/>Rita's desperate need for attention has driven away everyone she's ever known. Ben never got close enough to anyone to scare them off in the first place. In fact, he hasn't left his apartment in ten years. But When Rita's recently widowed daughter, Eve, and teenage child, Sammy, come to live with Rita, the walls are broken down, literally. As Rita &amp; Ben's worlds collide, they are faced with a choice. Continue to live in fear or take a chance on love?<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Production Info<br/>
</h3>
<p><i>Ben &amp; Rita</i> is slated for a February 2014 production on the Waldron Stage at Mill Mountain Theater in Roanoke, Virgina. This is a co-production between Hollins Playwright's Lab and Mill Mountain Theater and will be directed by Chicago's one-and-only Ms. Cheryl Snodgrass. PLUS my AMAZING husband, Arne, is designing the set!<br/></p>
<p>Since these guys are taking a chance on me and my work, I have made it my goal to raise a portion of the production costs myself. I figure if I can get 200 people to donate $10, we can hit this goal in 30 days.<br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I know it's not always easy to help out but I sure would appreciate the support if you can!</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why Should You Donate?</h3>
<p>Because the world needs more plays that fill your heart and make the room gush ""awwww"" at the end, and <i>Ben &amp; Rita</i> does just that. </p>
<p>And we all know the right director makes all the difference in the world, so I'd like to start by raising funds to cover expenses to bring in our PHENOMENAL director. YOUR DONATION WILL HELP COVER OUR DIRECTOR'S STIPEND AND HOUSING.<br/></p>
<p>This is my way of putting the wheel in motion and making my career as a playwright happen. And someday, when my plays are being produced around the world and I'm accepting a Pulitzer, you can say you helped me get there!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're just too strapped to help out, I totally understand. Maybe you have friends or family on your FaceBook that wouldn't mind chipping in, so please share this with as many people as you can. Thank you!!!<br/></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Ben & Rita

<li>Help us promote our show.</li>
<li>Support our cast financially.</li>
<li>Ensure that we can maintain our goal of being ""Finally something that rivals Chicago Shakespeare"". -Chris Jones (Chicago Tribune)</li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our theatre space is a pirate ship that actually sails so your donations will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create weather adaptive costumes.</li>
<li>Spread the word about our unique theatre.</li>
<li>Augment our cast salaries. (Our actors do get paid to perform but this will help provide stipends for the rehersal process.)</li>
<li>Help purchase this year's new props that need to be bought and built.</li>
<li>Make you part of the process! Our perks are amazing! A ghost story CD, a cast album, the ever-curious Pirate-Gram, a handmade Cutlass from Rogue Steel and more!</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Let us take you back in time--twelve years ago our Producer (Orion Couling) and his sister (one of our Co-Directors Emma Couling) came up with a crazy idea to build sustainable theatre on an actual sailing vessel.

<p>Our production team has literally 40+ shows beneath thier collective pirate boots including <em>Treasure Island-</em>Lake Superior Theatre, <em>Romeo vs Juliette (Pirate vs Ninja</em>)- Pretty Windy, and last years sold out and critically acclaimed debut of this very show!</p>

<p>Hi I’m Joe Hill. About a year ago Travis Coe and I decided that it was time to start creating projects that meant more to us than what we were doing at school. We started The Unexpected Laboratory. While both studying Directing, Travis at Columbia College in Chicago and me at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, we have managed to create projects beyond what we had ever expected. Members of our company have creating shows in Cincinnati, a show in Chicago and our newest member Shaun Sutton sent a show to the Onyxfest in Indiana. Antigone is the biggest project The Unexpected Laboratory has planned. We are performing in Boulder Colorado in a beautiful space in The Dairy Center for the Arts called The East Theatre. This project will be the culmination of over a year of planning and it is time to truly make the push to make it a reality!</p>
<p>The house has 100 sharp red seats and a long catwalk over the stage. We envision a classical Greek Antigone where the Greek Chorus is a documentary film maker, the sooth sayer is a jive speaker jazz man, the king is a media giant, and the rest of the world lives in poverty and drug abuse. We need television screens to show the press conferences when Creon gives them, we need dirt to coat the stage when you see the reality of the poverty stricken streets that are often ignored by the cameras, we need costumes for the actors to wear that accurately show what kind of world they live in and we need spray paint for the graffiti that will cover the walls of our set.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to donate to our show we understand but there are other ways you can help our campaign! Social Media will ultimately be our best friend. Please share our page on your Facebook and Twitter. Just share us as much as you can and spread the word. Also, if you would like to help the production first hand or even be part of the cast contact either Joe Hill or Travis Coe for details.</p>

<h2>What if Shakespeare had written Pulp Fiction?</h2>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.hermajestyssecretplayers.com/artwork/NewPulpPoster_350.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin-left: 7px; margin-right: 7px;"" title=""Poster""/>Pulp Shakespeare imagines what it may have been like had the 1994 cult film Pulp Fiction been written by William Shakespeare, and presented as classical theatre. Set in Elizabethan England, this wildly entertaining parody weaves the story of a pair of murderers, their boss’ alluring wife, and a desperate knight.  While paying homage to the films witty dialogue and colorful characters, the production is firmly grounded in the language and rhetoric of Shakespeare’s time.</p>
<p>After being selected as a “Best of Fest” winner at the 2011 Hollywood Fringe Fest, our critically acclaimed play went on to three extensions in Hollywood, garnering two LA Weekly Award nominations in the process (Best Comedic Ensemble; Best Adaptation). And now we have been selected to participate in the 16th annual New York International Fringe Fest!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Help Us Get There!</h3>
<p>13 actors! Elizabethan Era Costumes!! Broad Swords &amp; Crossbows!!! And a set!!!! All of which have to get to New York from Los Angeles...</p>
<p>Being accepted into FringeNYC is an incredible opportunity that we are grateful for, and one that we hope leads to furthering our production (perhaps on tour to a theatre near you!). However, it's also an expensive opportunity that we would very much appreciate your help in realizing!</p>
<p>We need to raise <strong>between $10-$15K</strong> to make this trip happen. Your generous donations will go to the following:</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Airfare for our cast of thirteen</li>
<li>Lodging</li>
<li>Costume/Set/Prop rentals</li>
<li>Insurance</li>
<li>Stage Manager and Booth Operator fees</li>
<li>New York City publicist</li>
<li>Printing costs</li>
<li>And of course the occasional meal...</li>

</div></div>","What if Shakespeare had written Pulp Fiction?
Pulp Shakespeare imagines what it may have been like had the 1994 cult film Pulp Fiction been written by William Shakespeare, and presented as classical theatre. Set in Elizabethan England, this wildly entertaining parody weaves the story of a pair of murderers, their boss’ alluring wife, and a desperate knight.  While paying homage to the films witty dialogue and colorful characters, the production is firmly grounded in the language and rhetoric of Shakespeare’s time.
After being selected as a “Best of Fest” winner at the 2011 Hollywood Fringe Fest, our critically acclaimed play went on to three extensions in Hollywood, garnering two LA Weekly Award nominations in the process (Best Comedic Ensemble; Best Adaptation). And now we have been selected to participate in the 16th annual New York International Fringe Fest!
 
Help Us Get There!
13 actors! Elizabethan Era Costumes!! Broad Swords & Crossbows!!! And a set!!!! All of which have to get to New York from Los Angeles...
Being accepted into FringeNYC is an incredible opportunity that we are grateful for, and one that we hope leads to furthering our production (perhaps on tour to a theatre near you!). However, it's also an expensive opportunity that we would very much appreciate your help in realizing!
We need to raise between $10-$15K to make this trip happen. Your generous donations will go to the following:



Airfare for our cast of thirteen
Lodging
Costume/Set/Prop rentals
Insurance
Stage Manager and Booth Operator fees
New York City publicist
Printing costs
And of course the occasional meal...

We have a lot of great perks for those who donate!

T-shirts
Posters
Our Soundtrack
Speech and Movement classes taught by our own cast memebers
And much more!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<div class=""im"">
<p>I grew up in three different countries, but since I remember I have been surrounded by art. My grandma was a songwriter and a singer as well as my mom and aunties. </p>
<p>The idea of saying things through music and images was something that always caught my attention. My sisters and I used to make telenovelas, and for some reason I always ended being the director or the producer of the homemade novela.</p>
<p>Somehow I got involved in the production business at a very young age, and the idea of becoming a director was getting stronger. Unfortunately life took a different direction and I had to wait for the opportunity to arise.</p>
<p>Bit by bit the pieces fell in place and Burley Man came to me in a peculiar way.  </p>
<p>I was working in a play at a New York festival. Upon visiting with Ken Terrell, the director of the play, he told me about a script that he had for many years but to date he had not yet accomplished putting it on stage. He provided me with a copy of the script.  I read it and immediately fell in love with it. I wanted to direct more than ever.</p>
</div>
<div class=""im"">
<p><span>For some time, the director and I discussed the possibility of putting on a production of the play. Unfortunately, Terrell passed away before we could make the dream come true.</span></p>
<p>In Terrell’s honor, I have decided to produce and direct the play.</p>

</h3><p>In a new cabaret play about Weimar Berlin, including the French, British and American influences on this time, we follow the story of two New York City burlesque performers as they tire of America and follow their dreams of dancing and adventure to Europe, naturally ending up in Berlin in the 1920s. All told through song, dance, story telling (and a little bit of striptease). Along the way they perform traditional vaudeville burlesque, tableaux vivant, can-can, charleston and experience true 20s Berlin, both glamorous and gritty. There are appearances by stars of the time including the Mata Hari, Claire Waldorf, Marlene Dietrich, Anita Berber, and even Maria from the film Metropolis. The play ends with an audience sing-a-long to Berliner Luft, leaving everyone in high spirits and loving the city. <br/></p><p>Immoral Babylon Productions is writing, producing and performing the play.

</h3> <b>The Weather Project</b> is a year-long art and science community engagement project, culminating this summer (August 9th) with a spectacular outdoor musical play, art exhibition, and weather-climate-energy expo at the Yulan Ball Field in Yulan, NY!<br/><br/>The seed of the project was planted in the winter of 2012, when <b>NACL</b> Artistic Director Tannis Kowalchuk, a native of Winnipeg, felt an odd sensation from the absence of snow upon the western Catskill landscape. <i>""It was weird. I wanted to know why. I never really thought about the weather until it wasn't there; and then I started reading about what's going on with the climate--I became obsessed with climate science, weather data--and umbrellas. Everybody talked about how weird the weather had been, and of course the talk of climate change had been going on for years, but I felt unclear about what I could do, and just like Mark Twain (or whoever said it) said:</i> ""Everybody talks about the weather, but nobody ever does anything about it."" <i>But when I started digging around I found that some people, like the </i>Sullivan Alliance for Sustainable Development (SASD)<i>, were quite actively engaged in the matter, and that local town boards in Sullivan County, NY were considering climate measures at their meetings. I met with our Town of Highland Supervisor and a co-director of SASD about creating an event that would bring more people into the conversation--and </i><b>The Weather Project </b><i>was born.""</i> <br/><br/>We were awarded a ""creative placemaking"" grant from the National Endowment for the Arts which laid the foundation for this huge community endeavor involving seven local arts, environmental, and civic organizations, one Yulan resident who happens to be a climate scientist for NASA, 25 professional artists, and over 35 individual community members from all walks of life who will participate in the play--not to mention the participants and attendees of our climate symposium and other Weather Project events over the past year.<br/><br/><p></p> <p></p> <p> </p><h3>When It Rains, It Pours<br/>
</h3> <p>That's what we're hoping for here—a deluge of support! An amazing amount of energy and time have been committed to this project
 by the various participants, and now we turn to you, our friends around
 the country and the world to join with us and help us into the final 
stretch to make sure The Weather Project's message can engage and 
galvanize as many people as possible. Because, as our scientist 
collaborator, Elaine Matthews, puts it in plain English: ""We are already
 committed to climate change. If we were to turn off all the greenhouse 
emissions in the whole world today, the Earth would continue to warm for
 another 60 years."" Scientific data shows it is happening. Models 
predict that the effects in some parts of the world will be 
catastrophic. Are we going to just continue on and hope for the best? 
Should we change the course we're on? Can we? How can we move from ""it's
 a hopeless cause"" to ""what can I do to help?"" These are the important 
questions of The Weather Project.</p><br/><h3>What We Need<br/>
</h3>We currently need to raise another $15,000 to successfully mount the production we have envisioned and have been preparing for over a year. With your help we hope to raise a portion of that amount through this Indiegogo campaign. These funds will help us pay for critical expenses including advertising in local media outlets, promotional materials, and signage. Your donation will help pay for costumes, staging, microphone rentals, and technical support, and will also help us
 create a professional video documentary of the performance to serve as a
 model for others who wish to energize and mobilize their communities,

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Julia Siedlanowska and Kara Nolte: the directors of
Shakespeare Unchained. We have a mutual love for the ridiculously
serious and theatrically rhythmic. Our paths first crossed while
studying theatre at Douglas College and have just begun
producing, directing and creating our first show together.</p>
<p>The inaugural incarnation of Shakespeare Unchained is set to premiere
in June 2014. We are seeking funds to pay all the people involved in
creating the show. That means the directors (us), performers,
photographer, sound designer and marketing. We need to be able to put
our ideas into action and get this party off the ground!</p>
<p>Shakespeare Unchained breaks down the text of classic Shakespeare
plays and interprets it through the actions of the performers' voices
and bodies. We will use techniques from contemporary, classical dance
and physical theatre and all will be accompanied by an original sound
score.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $2184 to get the first phase of development going. Here is
where the money will go if we make our goal:</p>
<p><i>Indie GoGo's Cut of 4%: $84</i></p>
<p><i>Performers fees (approximately eight rehearsals of three hours
each = 18 hours per performer, plus one evening of performing. Equals
about $11/hour) $250 honorarium x four performers = $1000</i></p>
<p><i>Directors/Choreographers fees (approximately five hours per
week of researching, promoting, and completing administrative tasks,
preparing rehearsals, plus 100 plus hours of rehearsal time Equals
about $2/hour) $400 honorarium x 2 directors/choreographers = $800</i></p>
<p><i>Rehearsal space: Generously donated by Black Suns Studio and
Douglas College</i></p>
<p><i>Sound Designer Honorarium: $100</i></p>
<p><i>Photographer Honorarium: $100</i></p>
<p><i>Advertising: $100</i></p>
<p>We have some pretty rad perks for our generous donors:</p>
<p><i>Personal online thank you on Julia and Kara's Social Media
pages, the Shakespeare Unchained Blog and the Shakespeare Unchained
FB Page! Shout out!</i></p>
<p><i>Early bird emailed preview of characters interpreted for show
and backgrounds on the play! Get the text breakdown behind the
movement!</i></p>
<p><i>Handmade, signed Shakespeare themed cards from directors! You
will want to frame these!</i></p>
<p><i>One hour personalized dance or acting class by one of the
directors! We would love to get into the studio with you!</i></p>
<p><i>Exclusive invite to last rehearsal before show and cast wrap
party! Get to know our performers and share your feedback with them
once you've seen the show!</i></p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, we will split the money using
the same breakdown of resources we have set in our goal. Everyone
involved will be compensated as fairly as we can manage.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We want to create exciting work for our communities to enjoy.
Shakespeare is recognizable and filled with dramatic, entertaining
characters. We want to show people another interpretation of these
classic characters.</p>
<p>The potential we see in maximizing the audience's enjoyment by
blending dance and theatre is endless. Bringing these two ways of
interpreting character together makes the experience more accessible,
more fun and more versatile. A show of this sort could be performed
anywhere! We see it going into schools, senior's centres, festivals,
and coffee shops. This is a high impact idea for our community!</p>

A director from Italy, an actor from Colombia and an actress from Australia began an epic journey of cross-cultural collaboration. The idea was to create a theatrical experience exploring the disparity between the rich and poor in contemporary society which would speak to a diverse international audience. The result was a modern re-imagining of August Strindberg's Miss Julie, performed in English and Spanish. Our dream was to eventually perform in the Iberoamericano Festival in Bogotá, and this year that dream will come true. After a season in Bogotá in August 2013, Miss Julia was invited to be a part of the festival's 2014 Colombian program. <br/><br/><a href=""http://festivaldeteatro.com.co/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://festivaldeteatro.com.co/</a> (full Colombian program to be announced soon)<br/><p>
</p>This new bi-lingual 
adaptation by SITI Company's J.Ed Araiza brings together 7 artists from 4
 different countries! Miss Julia is an international collaboration between renowned 
Colombian film and television actor Jhon Alex Toro, Australian theatre artist Tina Thurman, Colombian actress Gina 
Jaimes, Italian Stage Director Lorenzo Montanini, with music by US violinist Helen Yee and Colombian percussionists Juan Manuel Vergara and Daiana Mutis.  <br/><br/><p>Set in Colombia on Midsummer Eve, Miss Julia and her servant Juan 
have an encounter that will change their lives forever. As Juan tries to
 rise from the depths of his servile life, Miss Julia wants to 
escape the bonds that tie her to a meaningless upper-class existence. 
The result is a power play of love, lust and a battle of the classes which 
becomes violent and seemingly out of control.</p>
<p>This bi-lingual production, performed in English and Spanish, will be
 a clash of cultures, a dance of death combining heightened physicality 
and rich naturalistic text. This unique take on Strindberg's text makes 
Miss Julia as profound today as it was 100 years ago.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To make this international collaboration a reality we need to raise 
funds for the artists airfares to Colombia. We 
have a number of exciting perks including unique photographs 
of our time in Bogotá, personalized behind the scenes DVD's, audition coaching, sunset sailing cruises on the 
Hudson river, personal concerts and dinners cooked in your home, by members of the cast. <br/></p><p>Other ways in which people can help is by sharing this campaign on social media or we will also take donations of Frequent Flyer points.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our goal is to promote cultural exchange between Colombia, the US, 
Australia and Italy by presenting a classic piece of drama that is 
accessible to both Spanish and English speakers and to those who are not
 regular theatre goers. At the Iberoamericano Festival we will also have the chance to perform for and meet international producers and presenters with the ultimate goal of touring the piece globally.<br/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><br/><p></p><p></p></div>","Short SummaryThree years ago, a chance meeting of three theatre artists in New York spawned a dream.

</div></div>","THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HELPING TO MAKE OUR CAMPAIGN A SUCCESS!

We're so humbled by all of the generous support - but we're not done yet!  We still have time in our campaign and have heard that there are still people out there that want to donate so we've set a new goal - $2500!
Why $2500? (Or why can't we just be happy about the $1500?)  Because this venture isn't a one time project.  Our last company meeting was electrified with all the ideas our members have for future projects and productions!  Every dollar we fundraise and don't use for this production of Island helps us be that much closer to making those exciting productions a reality - here's a teaser of some of the inspiring work we're looking forward to bringing you:
A full production of Island outside of the Festival format
A series of plays structured around the work of an underappreciated Japanese playwright with actors and puppets sharing the stage
A top secret project that will allow our group to produce our first collaboratively created show
A fun romp through the brain of one of our group's own members
An existential production that is updated for today's audience

and much, much more!


Our Story

Island is the inaugural presentation of the newly formed Black Cat Theatre Group - a venture over 10 years in the making.  We have been working on the play for several weeks in anticipation of a presentation in August 2011 but we just received word that we have been accepted to present at the BoCoCa Arts Festival!What does that mean?  That means we have just over a month to raise the funds we need to produce in the festival - and that's where you come in...The Impact
Your financial support of this project not only secures our ability to produce this production but also demonstrates to future funders that we have a base of supporters for our organization, allowing us to have a strong showing for foundations and companies that may grant funds for future projects.  
Your donation today ensures our success and sustainability tomorrow.


Why $1500?
Why $1500?  With complete funding we will be able to: secure our spot for the festival, build costumes for our performers, purchase props, rent lighting and sound equipment, execute a marketing plan that we hope will sell out our tickets, and cover any last minute details or emergency expenses.
Additionally, every dollar that we fund above the $1500 goal goes towards securing a venue for our August 2011 presentation of Island.  And we cannot say enough that whether you donate $5 or $500 your donation MATTERS.

Other Ways You Can HelpThere are so many ways to help other than donating money (although we hope you'll do that too)!Follow us on Twitter, Like our page on Facebook, share this campaign with others (via the neat tools above and below), and/or buy a ticket to the show (details coming soon)!

<h3>Help Further Nia's Passion:</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Join TEAM Nia today! Nia has the honor of being selected by world renowned Dance Theatre of Harlem to attend the 2013 Summer Intensive program which is two weeks long, Nia has also been selected by Northwest Tap Connection to attend The Chicago Rhythm Festival to participate in their intensive week long training workshops! I'm sure you'll agree this is a big deal. Nia loves various aspects of dance (as you'll see in her video). Nia promises to do her best which if you know her...you <strong>KNOW</strong> that's true. She will apply the same dedication and work ethic that she applied in becoming Student Body President. What an honor this is for Nia. She's simply buzzing with excitement. Her family sees this as a gateway to further her education with scholarships for college (which both her parents feel is coming quickly). Having these accomplishments on her transcripts will give Nia the edge that is needed for both academic and social advancement. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; Why We Need It</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>This is the part that's tough...just being honest. However, you deserve to know especially since you are joining TEAM Nia. Although both parents are active in Nia's life let's face it the concept that it takes a village is more real today than ever before. Nia's mom Shawnette (for description purposes only) is technically a single mom. An incredible one if I may add. With that, she is the breadwinner for her family. She has never wanted to impede or stifle her children's ability to go after their dreams based on budget. This requires everyone to reassess what's important. The total amount needed is $7,777.00. This will cover travel expenses, food and lodging for Nia, Shawnette (her mom), and her sister Bria. They are definitely a package deal. The best part of this process is what it does for each of them. Nia gets to follow her bliss! Nia, indirectly gives Bria permission to go for her dreams (organically she does by watching their mother Shawnette) on an even grander scale. Shawnette gets to step outside of her comfort zone and watch her both of her daughters learn that there truly are no limitations if you work hard! What greater gift is there for a parent? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>One of the things that we think would be cool to offer for your support is a postcard from N.Y, Chicago or both (depending on your level of help). Nia will personally write them to each friendly sponsor. Another item is a ticket to one of her live performances if you live in the state of Washington (or have a scheduled trip that correlates). If you are out of area, a dvd of her performance will be provided in AVI format.</p>
<p>Although we can't imagine it happening if we don't with your help reach our entire goal we will continue to use the resources raised and you may see Nia &amp; Co. tapping in Downtown Seattle to raise the difference. She's raised $200.06 so far. Don't you admire that she is out there doing her part? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Another reason to join TEAM Nia!</p>

<h3>What's Important About Joining TEAM Nia?</h3>
<p>Glad you asked! I say that somewhat facetiously I admit. Allow me a couple of sentences to share. We ALL hear and read about children that are aimless, do we not? Well, here is an opportunity to help a child that has her head on straight, passionate about several things, well-rounded and kind. Here's a chance for you to actively make a difference. For the amount of your Starbuck's budget or one less pair of shoes from Macy's or Nordstrom's (Nordstrom's Rack included) you can send Nia to Dance Theatre Of Harlem and The Chicago Rhythm Festival. It will be greatly appreciated. Imagine how much her confidence will soar knowing that YOU believe in her! That's what's important about joining TEAM Nia.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>It Takes A Village</h3>
<p>We can't get Nia to both Chicago and New York alone we need your help! Please let people know about Nia. Tweet it, share the link on Facebook, Pinterest, MySpace (it's new and improved they say), email, Linked In and any other sites you are affiliated with. We are envisioning GREAT things for Nia. What's even better is that Nia is envisioning great things for herself! If people can spread links about cats, jokes, hollywood break-ups and everything in between...surely spreading the word about an incredible young lady is okay. I guess I should say imo (in my opinion) on that one.</p>
<p>Thank you for your consideration. To quote lil Miss Nia herself, ""she'll do her best""!</p>

I started a dialogue with Marzia Caccioppoli and with the association Noi genitori di tutti www.noigenitoriditutti.it (We are the parents of all), an association of mothers and fathers from the region who have lost their children to cancer. Marzia lives in Casalnuovo di Napoli. Her family left Naples looking for a pleasant place with clean air in the countryside. Instead, her son Antonio died of cancer at the age of nine. But we need your support. We need $9,000.00 to cover the last expenses of the project. We ask that you consider lending your financial support with the understanding that no donation is too small and all donations are tax-deductible for U.S. residents. A percentage of the donation will be given to Marzia and her Association.To accompany the performance, an informational booth will provide details about the toxic waste situation afflicting Campania Felix and how this situation can be compared to others around the globe.  We aim to provide further education in the increasing land and water contamination issues facing our global community. Today, I am joined by an entire company of dedicated artists of excellence from Campania, and neighboring communities, in the creation of Terra dei Fuochi / Land of Fire, including Composer Alberto Falco (Napoli, Campania), Lighting Design concept Marcello Falco (Napoli, Campania), Dancers Bianca Delli Priscoli (Salerno, Campania) and Laura Orfanelli (Abruzzo).We are proud to announce that La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club has invited Terra dei Fuochi / Land of Fires to receive its world premiere in March 2017, as part of their 55th season, and in doing so lend their support to the mission of the project.We have been granted a residency as well by prestigious Chashama Org.. The residency took place December 7-20, 2016 with performances on December 15, 16, 17, 18. *Performance photos by Barbara Gentile Photography",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We are a a newly emerging theatre company (founded by a British Australian – Bj McNeill and a Pole - Nastazja Somers) born from the need
to create contemporary, challenging and political work and to bring theatre
back to the people. </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We met during our training at drama school and discovered that, despite being from opposite sides of the world, we share the same values and ideas when it comes to creating theatre and this is how No Offence Theatre was born! </span><br/></p>
<p>We want to work against the current trend that theatre and art in general is becoming an elitist industry, and create theatre for all people no matter who they are or where they are from. Whether our work is liked by many, few or none; we want to create for everyone. </p>
<p>As artists we do not
believe that the objective of theatre, or any form of art, should be solely
entertainment. We do not believe in theatre that exists only to entertain people, and too often entertains only those select few that can afford it. We feel that creatives should be responsible for exploring
all types of issues and problems surrounding humanity and the world we live
in. We strive to create unconventional, raw and truthful work that will both
challenge people emotionally and make them question the status quo. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>This Project... </h3>
<p>This project is particularly important to us as it is not only the debut play by Bj but also because it is our first project as a theatre company so it is our first offering to society as artists under <i>No Offence Theatre. </i>Our reputation relies on the journey of this play being a successful one. (Check out our video for what <i>Torn Apart </i>is about!!)</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What you help us achieve.. </h3>
<p>Although it sounds idealistic, we do believe that theatre can change the world and instigate positive shifts in society. Even if it is just one person in the audience during one show that takes a message away that promotes equality, awareness or understanding about humanity<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> it means we are doing our job right!<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">If we can finance our project we will be able to propel ""Torn Apart"" further to reach a greater audience and have a better chance of achieving our dream of effectively instigating positive change in society. </span></p>

<p>We could not agree more with this statement. Art is
one of the most important facets for humanity. Over the last couple of years
the art industry in the UK has suffered immensely from all the cuts implemented
by the Tory Government. People from less privileged backgrounds are often
completely shut out from the world of theatre, as it is something beyond their
financial reach. We do not agree with this and it makes us want to change
things. We want to create for EVERYONE! Theatre is about change and looking at
its history we can really see that!</p>
<p>This is why supporting companies like ours,
companies that start from absolute scratch and have nothing, but passion and
dedication, is so vital to the society we live in. After all theatre is about truth, so why should anyone be deprived of the right to explore it?<br/></p>

more money, which of course is an extreme challenge, but it also means richer more thoughtful art.  Our impetus to have a longer process comes from the need to explore and not be restricted in our explorations.  <br/><br/>Since <i>""Torn Apart""</i> is our first project for <i>No Offence Theatre</i>, our reputation relies on the success of this piece. <br/></span>

We are a a newly emerging theatre company (founded by a British Australian – Bj McNeill and a Pole - Nastazja Somers) born from the need
to create contemporary, challenging and political work and to bring theatre
back to the people. We met during our training at drama school and discovered that, despite being from opposite sides of the world, we share the same values and ideas when it comes to creating theatre and this is how No Offence Theatre was born! 
We want to work against the current trend that theatre and art in general is becoming an elitist industry, and create theatre for all people no matter who they are or where they are from. Whether our work is liked by many, few or none; we want to create for everyone. 
As artists we do not
believe that the objective of theatre, or any form of art, should be solely
entertainment. We do not believe in theatre that exists only to entertain people, and too often entertains only those select few that can afford it. We feel that creatives should be responsible for exploring
all types of issues and problems surrounding humanity and the world we live
in. We strive to create unconventional, raw and truthful work that will both
challenge people emotionally and make them question the status quo. 

This Project... 
This project is particularly important to us as it is not only the debut play by Bj but also because it is our first project as a theatre company so it is our first offering to society as artists under No Offence Theatre. Our reputation relies on the journey of this play being a successful one. (Check out our video for what Torn Apart is about!!)

What you help us achieve.. 
Although it sounds idealistic, we do believe that theatre can change the world and instigate positive shifts in society. Even if it is just one person in the audience during one show that takes a message away that promotes equality, awareness or understanding about humanity it means we are doing our job right!
If we can finance our project we will be able to propel ""Torn Apart"" further to reach a greater audience and have a better chance of achieving our dream of effectively instigating positive change in society. 
   What We Need & What You Get 
Unfortunately
nowadays our artistic freedom is often tested by the reality of living in a
capitalistic world. As a new company we stand no chance in getting government funding, hence we rely solely on the kindness of strangers and our
own pockets (and there isn’t much in them). We are aiming to raise £3000. To cover the costs of the following...

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>""The truth doesn't always set you free!""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A desperate desire to learn the truth about a tragic and traumatizing childhood event drives siblings Evan and Jessica to clash while their last parent lays on his death bed.</p>
<p>Jessica’s emotional roadblock continually prevents Evan from regaining his sanity which he is convinced can be returned to him by revealing this childhood secret from his father before he dies.</p>
<p>Will the revelation and truth from this traumatic childhood event bring peace and sanity to Evan like he hopes? Or is it best to keep some things hidden forever?  Time is the enemy, as the two siblings want vastly different outcomes from this life - changing situation.</p>
<p>Writer John Pastore teams up with Italian born director Maria Riboli to bring New York City a tale of family secrets and emotional rollercoasters with this gripping play. This spring, the clashing, secrets and dynamics of family life will be brought to life with an amazing and versatile cast at the Roy Arias Studios and Theaters in March of 2013.</p>
<p>No family is free of secrets, shame or lies. Will the truth of past events bring peace to this family or catapult them into a world they were not prepared to enter?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It is just like looking into someone's window during their most dramatic moments in their family life!</p>
<p>I've been in this business since I was 6 years old! I've acted and directed in Italy, Paris, London and of course NYC where I also teach acting at my own acting studio (<a href=""http://www.mariariboliactingstudio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>www.mariariboliactingstudio.com</strong></a>)</p>
<p>I was the executive producer, co-director and female lead in the theater production of ""<strong>BAAAHHH!!!</strong>"" which was accepted at the 2007 Fringe Festival, and then we extended the show for a full sold out month at the Payan Theater at The Roy Arias Studios &amp; Theaters, and taken to London! This, amongst many other theater productions, Broadway readings, voiceover projects for <strong>Verizon</strong>, <strong>Rosetta Stone</strong>, <strong>Barilla</strong> and now being the spokesperson and Director of Beauty and Wellness for Borghese on <strong>NBC</strong> Shopping Network, has given me amazing experience in how to bring things to LIFE! </p>
<p>My latest production was “Want &amp; Need” (<a href=""http://www.want-need.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.want-need.com</a>). I was the producer, director and female lead in the play. We had an amazing sold out run in November in the heart of the theater district in NYC! </p>

<p class=""p1""><b>The Story</b></p>
<p class=""p1"">The House’s fantastical re-imagining of this holiday classic centers on Clara’s journey to save her family from the Rat King before Christmas, with the help of a Nutcracker, a gift from her beloved Uncle Drosselmeyer. What unfolds is an epic holiday story that weaves riveting dialogue, astonishing puppetry, beautiful song and spellbinding spectacle together into a darkly moving story of magic and mystery.</p>

<p class=""p1""><i>The Nutcracker</i> is an adaptation of the original tale by E.T.A.
