<p><strong>CoronaCore</strong> is an Open Source project which allows you the relive the original
<a href=""http://blizzard.com/games/wow/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">World of Warcraft</a> and the <a href=""http://blizzard.com/games/burningcrusade/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Burning Crusade expansion</a> on your server,
your desktop or anywhere else you want.</p>
<p>As the original World of Warcraft is continually evolving and expanded with new
content, and game features, we started this project to give those who missed out
on the good old days when the game was different. Which means, if you’re a casual
player and haven’t gotten to see all of <a href=""http://blizzard.com/games/burningcrusade/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Burning Crusade</a>, this is your
chance to see and enjoy it fully.</p>
<p><strong>CoronaCore</strong> <em>enables</em> you, to install and run your own local or hosted
server for <a href=""http://blizzard.com/games/burningcrusade/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Burning Crusade</a>. The project <em>is not</em> about creating a
private server, it is about developing the software to do so and enabling you
to run it for friends and family!</p>

<a class=""headeranchor-link"" href=""#who-is-behind-it"" name=""user-content-who-is-behind-it"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span class=""headeranchor""></span></a>Who is behind it?</h3>
<p>The project is developed openly on <a href=""https://github.com/CoronaCore"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GitHub</a> by Christian Schamara and
Daniel S. Reichenbach. Daniel founded the original project to create free World
of Warcraft servers in 2005 and to this day continues to be involved in the
community. As developer his primary interest are delivering great software and
fun to the community. Christian joined the scene in 2007, and since then has
been contributing code and game content almost daily.</p>
<p>After almost <strong>nine years</strong> of development which we funded ourselves, we have
reached a point where we finally require community support to continue active
development, and continue providing <a href=""http://blizzard.com/games/wow/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">World of Warcraft</a> and the
<a href=""http://blizzard.com/games/burningcrusade/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Burning Crusade expansion</a> for your enjoyment.</p>
<p>In order to achieve continued development we started this campaign to let you take
an active part in the development and the continued growth of the project.</p>

<p>Due to the increased amount of time required to continue development of the <strong>CoronaCore</strong>
server for <a href=""http://blizzard.com/games/burningcrusade/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade</a>, we have to invest
much more time into development, which exceeds what we can privately fund.</p>
<ul>
<li>to increase our output of new features, bug fixes and content updates,
  we would love to work full time on the project which means roughly 30
  hours per week for each of us,</li>
<li>to provide better support for you, our users, we have to invest further
  resources into supporting material, e.g. to provide pre-built installers,</li>
<li>to provide user friendly documentation that lets you install our software
  and game content on your own server or desktop, we have to invest further
  resources.</li>
</ul><p>This combined exceeds what we can achieve with our spare time currently, thus
we would love to spend <strong>three months</strong> working full time <em>only</em> on bringing you
the best <a href=""http://blizzard.com/games/burningcrusade/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade</a> experience ever!</p>
<p>For two developers to expand the projects features for <em>three months</em> we would have
to collect <strong>1.800€</strong> for each developer monthly, or simply said <strong>3.600€</strong> for the
two of us to work one month full time to make our server software a greater experience
for you and your friends!</p>

<li>fix incoming bugs on a daily schedule,</li>
<li>revamp game content for zones, instances, battlegrounds, etc.</li>

CoronaCore is an Open Source project which allows you the relive the original

Who is behind it?
The project is developed openly on GitHub by Christian Schamara and

community. As developer his primary interest are delivering great software and

What We Need & What You Get
Due to the increased amount of time required to continue development of the CoronaCore

to collect 1.800€ for each developer monthly, or simply said 3.600€ for the

The Impact
With your support we could:

implement missing features much faster,
fix incoming bugs on a daily schedule,
revamp game content for zones, instances, battlegrounds, etc.
create missing game content such as world events,
finish incomplete features.
On top of that, we could expand our user support, allowing you to easier run your
own World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade server for your friends and
family.

Perks we offer!
As we are an Open Source project, we offer that will make our software
more fun for you to use. With each perk, you can chose an increased level of support

Risks & Challenges
If we do not get sufficient funding for working full time on the project, we will
still invest what we can gather to improve the project.

For centuries, Cobalt has been ruled by corporations seeking to enhance their wealth and influence with Brass. Brass doesn’t just fuel the economy but literally fuels the technology and transportation of the world through its unique thermodynamic properties. Every day these companies compete and battle to expand their territory and authority. Companies work to optimize their labor force and resources to mine the most Brass in each territory through corporate espionage, technology, security, and even sabotage. You work for such a company and have been tasked with expanding into a new region by constructing a new corporate complex, hiring employees, and battling other companies in the area.

<li>
<b>Reserve Decks - </b>Each player selects a corporation and has a small set of cards that only they can purchase from giving each faction it's own flavor and starting strategy. Advanced players can customize these decks.</li>
<li>
<b>Dual Center Rows - </b>One row represents the typical resource generating cards while the other row is comprised of cards that stay in play to sabotage players or give you an ongoing buff.</li>
<li>
<b>Combat - </b>Powerful units can attack and destroy any permanent design cards.  Be sure to strike first so an opponent doesn't take out your mining platform.</li>
<li>
<b>Mining Platform - </b>As long as this building stays operational you can convert the construction resource into victory points, but if a devious opponent takes it out - you'll have to rebuild or change your strategy!</li>

Welcome to the Steampunk world of Cobalt. For centuries, Cobalt has been ruled by corporations seeking to enhance their wealth and influence with Brass. Brass doesn’t just fuel the economy but literally fuels the technology and transportation of the world through its unique thermodynamic properties. Every day these companies compete and battle to expand their territory and authority. Companies work to optimize their labor force and resources to mine the most Brass in each territory through corporate espionage, technology, security, and even sabotage. You work for such a company and have been tasked with expanding into a new region by constructing a new corporate complex, hiring employees, and battling other companies in the area. The player who earns the most Brass will lead his company to victory in the region.Each turn, you will play Employee cards from your hand to gain resources. These resources will allow you to acquire new Employees, Buildings and Units for your deck. Along the way, you will acquire buildings to enhance your hold on the region and command units to attack other companies and mine for Brass. At the end of the game, the player with the most Brass is the winner.""(Brass Empire). A deck-builder with deeper player interaction. Played 8 times since PAX!"" -Ziggy @arrogantgamerIn short, Brass Empire is kinda like if Ascension/Dominion (Deckbuilding games) had a baby with Magic/Hearthstone (Battle Mechanics) and it was Steampunk. Check out some of the videos below to learn more about how to setup and play Brass Empire:Brass Empire has a lot more player interaction than other deck builders.  It is essential that you observe and adapt to the other players' strategies.  Here are some of the mechanics that make Brass Empire unique from other deckbuilding games:

Reserve Decks - Each player selects a corporation and has a small set of cards that only they can purchase from giving each faction it's own flavor and starting strategy. Advanced players can customize these decks.

Dual Center Rows - One row represents the typical resource generating cards while the other row is comprised of cards that stay in play to sabotage players or give you an ongoing buff.

Combat - Powerful units can attack and destroy any permanent design cards.  Be sure to strike first so an opponent doesn't take out your mining platform.

Mining Platform - As long as this building stays operational you can convert the construction resource into victory points, but if a devious opponent takes it out - you'll have to rebuild or change your strategy!

Download the (older and out of date) art-free Print and Play prototype here. You can learn more about the game on BoardGameGeek:https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181393/steamcraft""Played this at PAX Prime 2015 in the Indie MEGABOOTH and had a blast! This game plays like Dominion meets Magic The Gathering, with 5 factions that each have a unique and valid strategy. Very well thought out with just the right amount of strategy and each game takes just the right amount of time."" - AngelKatalyst  ""When all the Brass was collected and only one corporation remained, all the Child Geeks thought (Brass Empire) was a winner."" - Indepth Preview by Father Geek""Played it with a friend of mine who had never played a Deck Builder before, and the game is so well designed he was able to pick it up and soundly thrash me. It is great to see another card game come out that is not based in the fantasy realm, I think it ranks up there with Star Realms, both in gameplay and artwork."" - WolvenGarde Selected as one of 10 Games for the Indie Megabooth Tabletop showcase ""After playing through the #PAX2015 Indie Mega Booth tabletop games, @mgnade's (Brass Empire) was my favorite.

Nobody knows exactly when or where the company was created, but rumors say its origin can be traced back to the beginning of Egyptian civilization. Although their HQ can be found on Earth, several branches have been placed on populated planets to keep control on the company’s expansion through the galaxy.</p><p>According to the intergalactic committee of food critics, the company is rated number one on the “Milky Way's top list” of popular food chains, and third on the Local Galactic Group's list of most popular franchises, right after BoomBoomCandy Corp. and KokeKola. Its success can be attributed to two main factors: its willingness to localize their products for the taste of the local customers, and the hard work of their carefully trained delivery forces: known as the “Delivery Braves”</p><br/><p><b>The Pizza Brave Clients</b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/NSusJz5spbgVJT1IxIGkXgDLDmRXOVEPwHYERXXEGTKOusspqSvsDDzwdN6e2nAG3CMIqcBFChQ5kGUzFoToozuL0pUPOgvXvqzm0ZYQZP4tpykZopOPuoKm76HuKfeoqXZOr94"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><a href=""http://pizzabrave.com/mino-t-aurus/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Mino T.

Nobody knows exactly when or where the company was created, but rumors say its origin can be traced back to the beginning of Egyptian civilization. Although their HQ can be found on Earth, several branches have been placed on populated planets to keep control on the company’s expansion through the galaxy.According to the intergalactic committee of food critics, the company is rated number one on the “Milky Way's top list” of popular food chains, and third on the Local Galactic Group's list of most popular franchises, right after BoomBoomCandy Corp. and KokeKola. Its success can be attributed to two main factors: its willingness to localize their products for the taste of the local customers, and the hard work of their carefully trained delivery forces: known as the “Delivery Braves”The Pizza Brave ClientsMino T. AurusA friendly surfer who lives on a tropical paradise. He’s a cool guy who is always ready for a party.Mr. YetiAlways stressed, this grumpy businessman hates wasting time. Be fast on your feet or forget about your tip.The company takes pride on the efficiency of their delivery service, upholding their motto of “Be Brave, Face the Risks, Keep the Tips”. It’s for this reason that the aspiring future deliverers are provided with obstacle training and courage tests to evaluate and improve their performance (and they have to like cats too, for some reason). The explosive success of the company on the Milky Way has attracted lots of attention from the population of planets with less popular gastronomy (whoever controls the food controls the universe, after all), and all kind of alien species have traveled to Earth, the home planet of pizza, to prove themselves worthy of working for such prestigious company. While the company continues its seemingly unstoppable expansion across the galaxy, its employers compete among themselves to be the fastest, strongest and bravest of them all, dreaming with the day they could win the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of becoming the employee of the month.Martin BraveMartin and his twin sister Marlene left their little country house to look for adventures and opportunities in the big city. He is looking to prove his worth by becoming the employee of the month.Marlene BraveMarlene and her twin brother Martin left their little country house to look for adventures and opportunities in the big city. She is looking to prove her worth by becoming the employee of the month.FlameyFlamey is an “Ignus”, the only known species of the universe to inhabit a star. Her inner heat keeps the pizza warm, reason why she's known as one of the best Delivery Runners of the company, even when she sometimes burns the pizza box. However, her popularity doesn't stop her from reminding people that she's only working there half-time to pay for her studies on Nuclear physics.Tyrannosaurus Regina, Movie StarRegina was born in a closed jurassic community, located on an abandoned island. Even though her peers were happy living simple lives, she knew she was destined to greater things. Following her dreams of becoming a movie star, she moved to the continent and got the best job available for someone of her skills, saving money and performing auditions until her dreams can finally come true.Dr. Nado, Science ResearcherDr. Nado was a member of Pizza Brave’s research wing, the group in charge of creating new pizza flavors. After an accident resulted in a group of test animals earning self-awareness, the company demanded their researchers go through the security-awareness training taken by the runners. Dr. Nado enjoyed the experience so much he decided to become a Delivery Brave himself.Get to know more about Pizza Brave, the Delivery Braves, and more Clients at www.pizzabrave.comWe prepared lots of cool rewards to thank you for helping us!

<div>The Indie Game Riot is a weekly podcast hosted by three people with a passion for indie games and the community that surrounds them. Our show seeks to accomplish these goals every week:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Support indie games and their developers by ""Starting a Riot"" to garner attention for them through our show.</li>
<li>Strengthen the community around indie games by enabling discussion, camaraderie, and support between developers and gamers alike.</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">""Enable the Evolution"" that indie gaming has already started within the video game industry.</span></li>
<li>Entertain the hell out of the ears of anyone that wants to listen!</li>
</ul>This campaign was created in order to improve the show and allow us to better attain the goals stated above. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Indie game developers injected passion back into the gaming industry. They are creating extremely innovative games that are usually very affordable (sometimes free!) and without the constraints of large corporations, have created a spark in the industry using their own imaginations and personalities that have inspired millions of people around the world, including us. We want to return the favor by giving developers as much support as possible and doing our part to strengthen the community that has bonded around their games.</span>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>Tony Y: </b><i>Please never stop posting. This podcast is one of my favorite ways to catch up on my fellow indie devs.</i>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<b>""Ilehsadam"" (Mod of Reddit.com/r/IndieGaming):</b><i> A lot of podcasters don't have a good flow going. You guys are great. You could probably talk about door knobs and I'd listen.<br/></i>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</div>
<blockquote><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Anthony P</b><i>: </i><i>I'm officially addicted to this podcast. The production quality put into this goes a really long way and every recommendation so far has been a great discovery. Lovin' this stuff, so keep it up!</i></span></blockquote>
<blockquote><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>""Inevpatoria"": </b><i>I’ve really grown to like the Indie Game Riot crew, their podcasts, and their streams. Reverend, Tekedo, and JaShinYa are three really good guys with a lot of passion for this burgeoning community. They approach indie games with care and enthusiasm. And they dedicate a staggering toll of effort to inform their listeners about the really cool things going on and the cool people making it all happen. Whether that means interviewing people just trying to get games off the ground, or by getting you connected to major events throughout the industry.</i></span></blockquote>

<p>If you are here, we can only assume that you love indie games as much as we do. The show's goal from the very beginning was to support the indie game community as much as we possibly can. With your help, we can do so much more!</p>
<p>For you, the backer, this means spreading the news about indie games you may have missed. If it weren't for the fact that you and many others, discovered them through us and supported them by playing their games, they may have been otherwise discouraged or financially unable to continue doing great work. For instance, imagine an indie gaming world where Castle Crashers has failed and subsequent games like BattleBlock Theater never came into fruition.</p>
<p>Not to mention how aspiring developers, who may have the next incredible indie game concept, may not have the resources to get the game started or have the ability to get the word out to more than their friends and family. With a better Indie Game Riot, we can not only tell everyone about their project, but improve their lack of resources through crowd funding, sales of the game, helping them network within the industry or even eventually helping through our ""Enable The Evolution Scholarship"" program!</p>

<p>Also, The Indie Game Riot has helped several developers push attention and sales of their games. We even helped a Kickstarter go past the tipping point of reaching their goal at the last minute!</p>
<p>Lastly, many fans of the show have expressed their thanks for showing them games they've enjoyed playing, but would have never known about if it wasn't for IGR!</p>

</div></div>","The Indie Game Riot is a weekly podcast hosted by three people with a passion for indie games and the community that surrounds them. Our show seeks to accomplish these goals every week:


Support indie games and their developers by ""Starting a Riot"" to garner attention for them through our show.
Strengthen the community around indie games by enabling discussion, camaraderie, and support between developers and gamers alike.
""Enable the Evolution"" that indie gaming has already started within the video game industry.
Entertain the hell out of the ears of anyone that wants to listen!
This campaign was created in order to improve the show and allow us to better attain the goals stated above. Indie game developers injected passion back into the gaming industry. They are creating extremely innovative games that are usually very affordable (sometimes free!) and without the constraints of large corporations, have created a spark in the industry using their own imaginations and personalities that have inspired millions of people around the world, including us. We want to return the favor by giving developers as much support as possible and doing our part to strengthen the community that has bonded around their games.


Here are what some listeners, as well as developers, have had to say about Indie Game Riot!



 (Makers of ""Papo & Yo""): Thank you for that beautiful and meaningful talk you had about Papo & Yo on your show!


Tony Y: Please never stop posting. This podcast is one of my favorite ways to catch up on my fellow indie devs.


""Ilehsadam"" (Mod of Reddit.com/r/IndieGaming): A lot of podcasters don't have a good flow going. You guys are great. You could probably talk about door knobs and I'd listen.




Anthony P: I'm officially addicted to this podcast. The production quality put into this goes a really long way and every recommendation so far has been a great discovery. Lovin' this stuff, so keep it up!
""Inevpatoria"": I’ve really grown to like the Indie Game Riot crew, their podcasts, and their streams. Reverend, Tekedo, and JaShinYa are three really good guys with a lot of passion for this burgeoning community. They approach indie games with care and enthusiasm. And they dedicate a staggering toll of effort to inform their listeners about the really cool things going on and the cool people making it all happen. Whether that means interviewing people just trying to get games off the ground, or by getting you connected to major events throughout the industry.

For an example of what we do and how our show is in its current state, check out our most recent episode:






The Hosts:

 JaShinYa: JaShinYa (Josh Musser) is the creator of ""Indie Game Riot!"", 

professional voice actor, as well as a Let's Player on Youtube. He creates videos of an 
eclectic assortment of games and hosts the podcast episodes on his channel. Indie 
games became a passion as he discovered more and more creativity and ingenuity 
within the community while also empathizing with the developers who work extremely 
hard to put their works of art into the public's hands. He lives in Pennsylvania with his 
wife, 2 year old daughter and a mystery baby living inside of his wife.Contact JaShinYa:Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/JaShinYaGamingFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/JaShinYaTwitter: https://twitter.com/JaShinYa

What Indie Game Riot means to Josh:





Tekedo: Tekedo (Dillion Schmidt) Is an award winning editor and film maker from eastern US. When not behind a camera or editing a film, Tek loves sitting back and playing video games. His Youtube channel, showcases his escapades in Planetside 2, as well as other titles that include incredible indie games. He is a video game lover and is 
always excited for the next independent release. Whether it be on Youtube or in his free 
time, there is never a moment that isn't a good time for a great game.Contact Tekedo:Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/TekedoPlaysFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TekedoPlaysTwitter: https://twitter.com/tekedo_

Why the indie game community is important to Tek:




 Reverend: Reverend (Bryan) is a professional IT guy. With a focus on 
systems administration and networking, he's worked with some pretty big names in the 
IT sphere. Despite being extremely active in other gaming hobbies (LARPing, tabletop 
games, etc.), he loves to kick back and spend some time going murder-hobo in various 
games. Lately though, he's becoming more and more disillusioned by the AAA scene andhas found himself more interested in the Independent Developer's scene.Contact Reverend:Youtube https://www.youtube.com/DSReverend Twitter: https://twitter.com/ReverendDS
 
What the indie game community and Indie Game Riot mean to Rev:




We need funding to move the show past the good level to GREAT. With a better, enhanced version of The Indie Game Riot, we will draw in new people to watch or listen to the show which will allow us to garner more attention for the games we feature. Below is an approximate breakdown of where the money will go:



More specifically, we will need: 



A website designed with back end capability that allows us to edit as needed.

A domain and hosting capable of giving us plenty of storage and bandwidth.
Professional motion graphics for the segment bumpers and possibly the intro and splash screen.
A similar, but upgraded logo design to give us a better presence online.
Better audio equipment (Mics, mixers, etc...). The better quality we have, the more people will stop and listen to what we have to say.
PC upgrades. In order for us to not only test out games that may potentially deserve a feature on the show, a better PC means more editing power.



Here are some of the things you get when you contribute!



  
  
   
   
  
  
 







If we exceed our goals, we definitely have plans for the additional funding:










On the other hand, if do not meet our goal, we will still be able to use whatever funding was given to us. Our needs are prioritized as such:

IndieGoGo/Paypal Fees and Perks (Note that IndieGoGo will take 9% as opposed to 4% if we do not meet the goal)
Website Design and Domain/Hosting
Updated and Professional Graphics
Equipment Upgrades
Stretch Goals

<p>Die Nachtblume - the Night Flower is a retro-style RPG centered on the character of Alexandra diCourtne, a pious young woman who wants nothing more than to help others.

""Hi Guys! looks good so far! keep up the good work. I worked on HoMM 3 and 4 creating all of the skill and spell icons and HoMM interface graphics and would be interested in possibly helping out with your great game. Let me know if you might need something that I could provide. Good Luck!"" Brian Kemper. Senior Artist 1997 - 2002, New World Computing
""Wow — your project is such a flashback!""Lisa Farina. Assistant Designer 1994 – 2001, New World Computing""Palm Kingdoms 3 is classic 'Heroes' gameplay at its finest""Review at TouchArcade
About The Game.Palm Kingdoms 3 is a heroes-inspired turn-based strategy for iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Mac OS X, and Windows.If you played games like Heroes of Might and Magic (TM), or Civilization (TM) from the 1990s, this game is just what you enjoy to play.If you are participating in Early Access for our Royal Bounty HD (download for Windows/Mac OS/Android) - then you know the level of attention to detail we will give to Palm Kingdoms 3.   Gameplay.You use your heroes to explore the map, gather resources, hire armies, and conquer castles. The castles are highly important for victory. In castles, you can build various constructions to improve your income, hire and upgrade monsters, learn new spells, and recruit heroes.We've got 7 castle types (and heroes), and each type has unique creatures, and playing strategy. We have Knight, Sorceress, Wizard, Barbarian, Necromancer, Warlock, and Varangian.The combat mode is also turn-based, and hexagonal, like the map. Each creature moves in its turn, according to its speed stat. Heroes can use one magic spell per round. Some creatures are melee, some are shooting, and some have the ability to fly over obstacles. We learn from the best strategies of the 90's. We're keeping what you liked in them, and take it a step further. Check out our work on Royal Bounty HD, an isometric one-hero RPG, built using the same game engine:
Map ScreenshotCity Building Screen
City Main Screen - SorceressCombat ScreenThe Graphics.We have hand-crafted pixel art graphics of huge size, suitable for modern ultra high-DPI screens. And it looks just fantastic.War Academy in three sizes for different DPI screens
Interface.Palm Kingdoms 3 will get a major facelift. The mobile version will gain extra functionality, while keeping the interface minimal and simplistic.The Desktop version will have a full-fledged PC GUI. It will feel just the way a PC game should. The Tablet version will use the desktop GUI, adapted for touch-screens.
Mobile User InterfaceWhy Crowdfunding?It is a very large project. And we want to make it right. We need extra artists, extra programmers, and map designers. And testing.Programming: this is a huge project, and we will hire extra programmers to speed up coding.Graphics: The biggest part of the total budget is reserved for pixel art sprites, and cut-scenes.Voice Acting and Soundtrack: This is another big part of the project development. We will use the funds to complete the soundtrack, and voice acting for cut-scenes.Level Design: this can only be done when the game is 100% complete. We will get experienced map makers that made maps for classic turn-based strategies.Rewards.We have carefully thought about rewarding our backers. In addition to each reward tier, we add a bonus: a DRM-free copy of Dwarf Tower for Windows.  Moreover, each backer will get this bonus Dwarf Tower reward even if our campaign fails.  Stretch Goals.------- 25,000: Campaign --------The most important thing we would like to be introducing in Palm Kingdoms 3 is the campaign mode. Playing single scenarios is fun enough, but you always wanted to be involved in something bigger. So here we are: introducing a story mode! It's main feature is non-linearity. You will have more that one way to complete it, resulting in different tactics. It has greater replay value, since every time you choose another playing style, you get different heroes, different spells and fight on different maps. Campaign Hero, transformed into a Knight, or a Necromancer Campaign Cut-Scene - 30,000: Random Map Generator -What really adds the replay value is the long-awaited random map generator. A good random map generator must give you challenging and non-trivial maps that can be still be passed if you try hard enough. ------- 40,000: Improved AI -------- Palm Kingdoms 2 Artificial Intelligence was good enough. However, experienced players new how to trick it into doing something stupid, like buying ships constantly or taking unnecessary risk. It all has changed now. The AI in Palm Kingdoms 3 will be significantly improved with random elements added and challenge increasedOld AI is trying hard to overcome the new AI---- 50,000: Built-in Map Editor ----- Building maps for Palm Kingdoms was always complicated because the official Map Editor was only available on Microsoft Windows. Not anymore! We are going to built a fully-functional map editor right into the game. You can change the world as you go. Then click Save and that's it. A new map is ready. Perfect, isn't it?------- 60,000: Linux Version -------- Linux gaming is growing. It is important for us to provide Linux users with a quality build for most popular Linux versions.------- 80,000: Mods Support -------- For all of you who always want some more there is one feature of Palm Kingdoms 3: the mod studio. Now you can tweak each and every aspect of the game: monster costs, map rules, visitable buildings actions, spells, castles and so on. Beware! You really need to think what you are doing. Ruthless customizing might ruin the game for you or even make it unplayable! Got more designs for The Paladin?

The Platform


It just works: Choose a name for your game project, send a link to your friends, you're up and running!
Simple, straight-forward editing tools, rethought to be usable by mere mortals.
Community of people to partner with and projects to contribute to.
A store to find and publish models, maps, behaviors or entire games. The idea is that you'll be able to share stuff on the store for free or charge for it. Note that you don't have to use the store. You will be able to export your game and distribute / sell it without owing me anything!
Much more:

Built-in revision system, you can go back in time and restore old versions of your assets. (already implemented)

Collaborative rich-text document editing à la Google Docs for laying out your game's story or gameplay mechanics (already implemented)

Project access policies & moderation features so you can choose whether your project is private or anyone can join and help. No text files editing, it's all part of the main client. (partly implemented)


It will run on Windows / MacOS X / Linux when finished (currently Windows-only)



By removing the technical hurdles and connecting people with one another, I hope CraftStudio will start a revolution in how games are built.

</p><h2>Le contexte</h2><p>
</p><p>La mémoire est une fonction qui permet
d’apprendre et de conserver toutes sortes d’informations, dans le but de les
réutiliser par la suite. C’est la mémoire qui permet de reconnaître des objets
et des personnes, en associant leur aspect avec leur nom et leur fonction.
C’est également la mémoire qui permet d’apprendre à parler ou à faire du vélo,
en apprenant les successions de gestes à produire. C’est encore la mémoire qui
nous permet de raisonner, en faisant appel à des concepts abstraits que l’on a
déjà mémorisés, pour les appliquer sur de nouvelles informations.</p><p>
</p><p>La
mémorisation se décompose en plusieurs étapes : l’encodage des
informations, leur stockage, et leur récupération. Il est possible d’améliorer
sa mémoire en s’exerçant à mieux encoder les informations, pour récupérer plus
facilement les souvenirs par la suite.</p><p>
</p><p>Il
en va de même pour les autres fonctions cognitives : l’attention (qui
permet de se concentrer longtemps sur quelque chose, ou de faire plusieurs
choses à la fois), les fonctions exécutives (qui permettent de planifier ses
actions, de s’organiser, ou encore de raisonner sur des choses complexes), le
langage (qui permet de s’exprimer, en choisissant les termes corrects, sans
hésiter sur les mots). </p><p>
</p><p>Tous
ces aspects de la cognition sont des éléments essentiels d’un bon
fonctionnement dans les activités quotidiennes, et d’une bonne qualité de vie,
en particulier lorsqu’ils sont associés à une bonne motivation. La mémoire et
la motivation, ainsi que d’autres fonctions cognitives, peuvent être altérées
par de nombreuses pathologies cérébrales, comme la maladie d’Alzheimer ou
encore un Accident Vasculaire Cérébral.</p><p>
</p><ul><li>Entrainer
sa mémoire et les autres processus cognitifs peut donc contribuer à maintenir une
bonne autonomie. Pour cela, il est indispensable de disposer d’exercices
ludiques et motivants, et donc d’avoir du plaisir tout en s’entraînant.</li></ul><p>
</p><p>En
France il existe un réseau de 506 Centres Mémoire. Chacun de ces centres
adresse des informations, pour chaque consultation, à une base de données
Nationale (la BNA). En Février 2015, il y avait 579.798patients dans
cette base de données.</p><p>
</p><p>8,9%<span>  de ces sujets présentaient une plainte
mnésique, et 59% une Maladie d'Alzheimer ou une pathologie associée. Cet instantané
reflète une situation qui est commune à de nombreux pays.</span></p><p>
</p><p>En
dehors des consultations pour faire une évaluation et un diagnostic, et des
quelques traitements médicamenteux disponibles, il est important de proposer
aux patients et aux familles des solutions pour entraîner la mémoire et les
fonctions cognitives d'une manière motivante et innovante. </p><p>

</ul><p></p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p></p><h2>The context</h2><p></p><p>
</p><p></p><p>Memory
is the cognitive function which allows learning and storing information, to be re-used
later. Memory allows to recognize objects and persons, and to associate the
person’s aspect to her name and function. Memory allows learning talking and
biking, by storing the sequence of movements to be performed. Memory also sustains
reasoning, thanks to the abstract concepts memorized before that can be applied
to new domains and information. </p><p></p><p>
</p><p></p><p>Memory is a multi-stage ability,
which includes information encoding, storage and recovery. Memory can be
improved by training our ability to encode the information. Better encoded
information will be easier to recover in a second moment. </p><p></p><p>
</p><p></p><p>Similar observations can apply to
other cognitive functions, such as attention (which allows to concentrate on
something for a long time, or to make several things at the same time),
executive functions (which allow actions planning and organization, or to
perform complex reasoning), and language (which allows us to express ourselves
using the right words without any difficulty). </p><p></p><p>
</p><p></p><p>All these aspects of cognition
are crucial for a normal functioning in the activities of daily living, and for
a good quality of life, in particular when associated to high motivation.
Memory and motivation, similarly to the other cognitive functions, can be
impaired due to different brain diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease or a
stroke.</p><p></p><p>
</p><p></p><p>Training our memory and the other
cognitive functions can contribute to maintain a good autonomy. But to train
ourselves it is necessary to have exercises which are entertaining and
motivating, so that we can have fun while working.</p><p></p><p>
</p><p></p><p>In France there is a network of
506 Memory Centers. Every center enters the data collected for each patient,
and for each consultation, into a national database (BNA, Banque Nationale
Alzheimer). In February
2015, the BNA contained data from 579.798 patients.</p><p></p><p>
</p><p></p><p>8,9% of these patients presented
a subjective memory complaint, and 59% had Alzheimer’s disease or related
disorders. These numbers are aligned to what happens in many other countries. </p><p></p><p>
</p><p></p><p>In addition to the consultations
for assessment and diagnosis, and to the few existing pharmacological
treatments, it is important to propose to the patients and their families
solutions to train the memory and other cognitive functions in a motivating and
innovative way.</p><p></p><p>

jeux sont développés très rapidement, directement au sein d'une équipe composée
de cliniciens et d'ingénieurs

Ces jeux sont gratuits
pour les usagers. Vous pouvez les tester dès maintenant sur le site www.memory-motivation.org




Le contexte
La mémoire est une fonction qui permet
d’apprendre et de conserver toutes sortes d’informations, dans le but de les
réutiliser par la suite. C’est la mémoire qui permet de reconnaître des objets
et des personnes, en associant leur aspect avec leur nom et leur fonction.
C’est également la mémoire qui permet d’apprendre à parler ou à faire du vélo,
en apprenant les successions de gestes à produire. C’est encore la mémoire qui
nous permet de raisonner, en faisant appel à des concepts abstraits que l’on a
déjà mémorisés, pour les appliquer sur de nouvelles informations.
La
mémorisation se décompose en plusieurs étapes : l’encodage des
informations, leur stockage, et leur récupération. Il est possible d’améliorer
sa mémoire en s’exerçant à mieux encoder les informations, pour récupérer plus
facilement les souvenirs par la suite.
Il
en va de même pour les autres fonctions cognitives : l’attention (qui
permet de se concentrer longtemps sur quelque chose, ou de faire plusieurs
choses à la fois), les fonctions exécutives (qui permettent de planifier ses
actions, de s’organiser, ou encore de raisonner sur des choses complexes), le
langage (qui permet de s’exprimer, en choisissant les termes corrects, sans
hésiter sur les mots). 
Tous
ces aspects de la cognition sont des éléments essentiels d’un bon
fonctionnement dans les activités quotidiennes, et d’une bonne qualité de vie,
en particulier lorsqu’ils sont associés à une bonne motivation. La mémoire et
la motivation, ainsi que d’autres fonctions cognitives, peuvent être altérées
par de nombreuses pathologies cérébrales, comme la maladie d’Alzheimer ou
encore un Accident Vasculaire Cérébral.
Entrainer
sa mémoire et les autres processus cognitifs peut donc contribuer à maintenir une
bonne autonomie. Pour cela, il est indispensable de disposer d’exercices
ludiques et motivants, et donc d’avoir du plaisir tout en s’entraînant.
En
France il existe un réseau de 506 Centres Mémoire. Chacun de ces centres
adresse des informations, pour chaque consultation, à une base de données
Nationale (la BNA). En Février 2015, il y avait 579.798patients dans
cette base de données.
8,9%  de ces sujets présentaient une plainte
mnésique, et 59% une Maladie d'Alzheimer ou une pathologie associée. Cet instantané
reflète une situation qui est commune à de nombreux pays.
En
dehors des consultations pour faire une évaluation et un diagnostic, et des
quelques traitements médicamenteux disponibles, il est important de proposer
aux patients et aux familles des solutions pour entraîner la mémoire et les
fonctions cognitives d'une manière motivante et innovante. 



Qui sommes nous ?
Créée en 2011,
Innovation Alzheimer (IA) est une association de loi 1901 qui a pour principal
objectif de mettre l’innovation au service
des usagers, tout particulièrement pour les
personnes présentant une
maladie d’Alzheimer, des
pathologies apparentées ou des troubles
neuropsychiatriques.

http://www.innovation-alzheimer.fr/accueil/

IA est composée de psychologues, de
médecins, d’ingénieurs et de chercheurs.
A l’interaction entre clinique et recherche, IA est la structure idéale pour àla fois développer et valider en clinique des solutions
innovantes.
L’association IA est
le support de l’équipe de recherche
CoBTeK (Cognition Behavior Technologies) de l’Universitéde Nice Sophia-Antipolis et du CMRR (Centre Mémoire de Ressources et de Recherche) du CHU de Nice, dirigés par le
Professeur Philippe Robert.  
IA est une association sans but lucratif.
IA est localisée à l’Institut Claude
Pompidou à Nice, France.
Dans le cadre de la recherche, IA est déjà impliquée dans de nombreux
projets de recherche nationaux ou internationaux:
FP7: Dem@Care: http://www.demcare.eu/

Notre
motivation
MeMo est la suite logique aux actions de recherche
et de soins de l’association IA : offrir aux usagers le moyen de continuer
à entrainer et stimuler cognition et motivation, indépendamment des visites
dans un Centre Mémoire.
En tant que
professionnels de santé, nous prenons en charge des patients atteints de
troubles cognitifs lors de consultation médicale ou d’ateliers de stimulation
mnésique. Mais également, nous animons des ateliers de prévention pour les
séniors soucieux d’entrainer leur mémoire. Les personnes dont nous nous
occupons nous demandent souvent comment continuer à s’exercer chez eux. 
Nous avons
essayé plusieurs solutions, mais malheureusement aucune ne répond à ce besoin
de façon satisfaisante tant sur le plan de l’efficacité thérapeutique qu’en
terme d’accessibilité financière.  
Nous
souhaitons développer une solution qui pallie à tous ces manques : 


Conçue par des professionnels de santé,

Développée directement et rapidement dans l’équipe

Adaptée selon le niveau d’efficience cognitive,

Accessible à tous gratuitement
Multi-langues



Notre méthode de travail
Nous avons défini une méthode de travail
pour atteindre nos objectifs rapidement et efficacement qui met à contribution du début à la fin du
processus toutes les compétences dont nous disposons.Nous organisons chaque fin de mois des tests utilisateurs, 2 ont déjà eu lieu, en janvier et février. 


Budget
Le
financement a pour objectif d'engager des prestataires pour apporter la main
d’œuvre supplémentaire nécessaire à la réalisation du projet (développement,
graphismes, ergonomie). Aujourd'hui,
le projet MeMo a pu démarrer grâce aux fonds propres de l'association et
grâce àdes premiers dons,
notamment du Lions Club International District Côte d'Azur.
Nous
souhaitons sur 1 an financer les moyens humains et matériels pour :


Développer 12 exercices
ludiques pour tablettes et PC,


Organiser des évènements de tests et de présentation du projet,


Sécuriser le projet en définissant un modèle économique viable, social et
non lucratif,


Cadeaux de remerciements. 

Si nous ne collectons pas la totalité des fonds demandés, les doncs collectés seront utilsés avce les mêmes objectifs mais nosu développerons moins de jeux. 

Comment nous aider ?

English version


For Whom?


For persons of any age with cognitive impairment 



Persons with Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders

Persons who had a stroke or a traumatic brain injury


For everyone willing to train his/her memory,
concentration and other cognitive functions


Where and with whom? 

With clinicians, who
will select the exercises most adapted to the patient’s difficulties in the
context of a rehabilitation program or of a cognitive stimulation activity. In
the consultation office, or at the memory center, or in institution.

At home, based on the personal needs and willingness
to train any cognitive function
Which innovation? 


MeMo is an innovative project because :

The games are conceived by the clinicians
together with the final users


The games are developed very rapidly by a team including clinicians and
engineers


The games are online and free
for the users. You can test them with the following link (soon in english) : www.memory-motivation.org




The context
Memory
is the cognitive function which allows learning and storing information, to be re-used
later. Memory allows to recognize objects and persons, and to associate the
person’s aspect to her name and function. Memory allows learning talking and
biking, by storing the sequence of movements to be performed. Memory also sustains
reasoning, thanks to the abstract concepts memorized before that can be applied
to new domains and information. 
Memory is a multi-stage ability,
which includes information encoding, storage and recovery. Memory can be
improved by training our ability to encode the information. Better encoded
information will be easier to recover in a second moment. 
Similar observations can apply to
other cognitive functions, such as attention (which allows to concentrate on
something for a long time, or to make several things at the same time),
executive functions (which allow actions planning and organization, or to
perform complex reasoning), and language (which allows us to express ourselves
using the right words without any difficulty). 
All these aspects of cognition
are crucial for a normal functioning in the activities of daily living, and for
a good quality of life, in particular when associated to high motivation.
Memory and motivation, similarly to the other cognitive functions, can be
impaired due to different brain diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease or a
stroke.
Training our memory and the other
cognitive functions can contribute to maintain a good autonomy. But to train
ourselves it is necessary to have exercises which are entertaining and
motivating, so that we can have fun while working.
In France there is a network of
506 Memory Centers. Every center enters the data collected for each patient,
and for each consultation, into a national database (BNA, Banque Nationale
Alzheimer). In February
2015, the BNA contained data from 579.798 patients.
8,9% of these patients presented
a subjective memory complaint, and 59% had Alzheimer’s disease or related
disorders. These numbers are aligned to what happens in many other countries. 
In addition to the consultations
for assessment and diagnosis, and to the few existing pharmacological
treatments, it is important to propose to the patients and their families
solutions to train the memory and other cognitive functions in a motivating and
innovative way.



Who we are

Created in 2011,
Innovation Alzheimer (IA) is an association (law 1901) which aims at putting innovation at service
of users, specifically of people suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders, and
from neuropsychiatric problems.http://www.innovation-alzheimer.fr/accueil/
IA includes psychologists, medical doctors, engineers and researchers. Thanks to
the close interaction between clinical work and research, IA is the ideal place
to develop and validate innovative solutions in the clinical domain.
IA sustains and supports the research team CoBTeK (Cognition Behavior
Technologies) of the Universityof Nice Sophia Antipolis and of the CMRR (Centre Mémoire de Ressources et de Recherche) of
the Nice Hospitals, directed by Professor Philippe
Robert.  
IA is a non-profit association.
IA is located at the Institut Claude Pompidou in Nice,
France.
In the research domain, IA
is already involved in many national and international research projects:

FP7 Dem@Care : http://www.demcare.eu/

FP7 VERVE : http://verveconsortium.eu/

FP7 IN MINDD : http://www.inmindd.eu/

AZ@GAME ""Investissements d’Avenir Développement de l’Economie Numérique AAP e-santé n°1 : Santé et autonomie sur le lieu de vie grâce au numérique"" : http://www.azagame.fr/

SafEE (Safe and Easy
Environment for Alzheimer’s disease) ANR –13 –TECS –0002 –0.

IA is also involved into prevention
and education activities:


Since 3 years, IA organizes memory workshops for elderly people of the
Nice Municipality, 

It organizes training meetings and events, and an annual workshop, which
in 2014 has been followed by more than 300 peopl. 

Azur TV - French news report on serious games during annual workshopFrance 5 - Allo Docteurs - French health programme with a report about serious games for Alzheimer patientsFrance 3 Régions - French news report on serious games for Alzheimer patientsOur
motivation

MeMo is the natural consequence of the research and clinical activities
of the IA association: it is meant to offer to the users a way to keep training
and stimulating their cognitive functions outside the visits done at the Memory
Center.
In quality of health professionals, we work with patients with cognitive
impairment during clinical consultations and workshops dedicated to memory
stimulation. But we also organize workshops more focused on prevention of
memory loss, dedicated to healthy seniors willing to train their memory. All
these people (patients and healthy eledely people) often ask us how they can
keep training at home.
We explored several existing solutions, but unfortunately none of them
was completely adapted to satisfy this need, either because the therapeutic efficacy
was unknown, either because they were too expensive.
Our aim is to develop a solution which can fix all these issues. Our
solution:


Is conceived and designed by health professionals

Is developed directly and rapidly by our team

Is adaptable to different levels of cognitive functioning

Is free and accessible to everyone online

Is multi-language

Our
method

To reach rapidly and effectively our goal we defined a
work method which makes use of all the competence available from the beginning
to the end of the process. Users tests are organized monthly. the first 2 users tests have been realized in January and February 2015. 


Budget
The funding will be employed to
consult experts working on specific aspects of the project (game development,
graphics and ergonomic).
MeMo project started
thanks to the funds of the association IA and to some early donations, in
particular those of the Lions Club International District Côte d'Azur.
Now we aim at funding
persons and materials for 1 year in order to: 

Develop 12
motivating exercises for tablet


Organize events to present the project and test
the games

Define a viable business model to keep our social non-profit nature

To thank the donations with rewards

If we won't manage to collect all the funds, we will use the available funds for the very same objectives, reducing the number of games.

<p></p></div>","Kasaria is an upcoming virtual pet site / rpg mix! Players partner up with a companion, which will help you settle into Kasaria to explore, battle, and more. The more time you spend with your companions, the quicker they'll learn English so that they can communicate more easily with you. Of course, the alternative is that you could learn their language instead!Involve yourself with your Human Avatar. Dress up to your heart's content and level it up through a variety of tasks to explore further areas of Kasaria.Customize your companion too with many accessories! All companions (apart from the basic colors) have unique poses, so you can resize or rotate accessories to fit them. If our selection isn't enough for you, you can even draw your own accessories and sell them in a marketplace for others to purchase!Discover many hidden secrets of Kasaria. Find clues in books, maps, or elsewhere and go treasure/knowledge hunting. There is a lot of land and treasure just waiting to be discovered!Battle wild creatures or other enemies to earn monster drops. Monster drops may be clothing, food, or other trinkets that can aid you through your travels.Play games, complete different types of quests, and interact with your companion! Or if you just want something relaxing to do, gather some bait and choose from a selection of spots to fish at. Currently, we have over 20 games!Communicate with other explorers through a shoutbox, private messages, or the forum! NPCs (non-player characters) may even make guest appearances.Of course we have a bounty of rewards to share with those who help out! In addition to the prize packs, all backers will be put on a honors wall that will remain on the site forever as our way of saying thanks!Everything is EXCLUSIVE unless otherwise stated.**GREEN DEALS - GET THEM WHILE THEY LAST**((short quick deals in limited quantity in order to help reach our goal! Keep an eye out on our social media sites to be notified when these deals are posted))*Restrictions: Provide a theme (ex: constellation, woodland, slime, etc) and our artists will take care of the rest! Initial concept sketches will be provided for your approval. Note - we will not accept themes that do not fit the Kasaria universe , or may be considered offensive to others. (No Earth-based holidays, cultures, copyrighted material, or other ideals - but animals or plants may be referenced. Also nothing that may be considered beyond something ""realistic"" for a planet. Some companion types may include accessories, but they should be kept to an absolute minimum.)Feel free to ask questions about what may or may not be accepted, but there is only one slot available! Should you purchase this perk and have your idea rejected, you are free to provide other ideas! We're happy to work with you for as much as necessary to make you happy :)*Choose from a list of companion or human NPCs to name! Restrictions: No blatant copyrighted names (Spongebob),no offensive or inappropriate names. While not many NPCsare named, duplicates are not allowed, and names still needto fit in the Kasa universe (like no ""Watermelon"", ""Wolfeschlegelsteinhausenbergerdorff"""")*Supply a photo reference and some likes that would best represent your pet.

<div>SUNK! is a social skill and action game requiring a steady hand, impenetrable concentration, and sharp wits combined with an appetite for suspense and intense laughter.  SUNK!:</div>
<div><ul>
<li>Social Game with tons of interaction</li>
<li>Skill is required to pour carefully while performing silly stunts</li>
<li>Sabotage is fully encouraged!  Can I screw up my opponents by pushing my turn to the limit?</li>
</ul></div>
<div>Geared to anyone from ages 5 and up (how about an adult version??), the goal of the game is to add water to the cup without causing it to sink. Seem simple enough?  Can you pour 1 drop while hopping on one leg or 2 drops with one eye closed??  What if the base starts shaking?? (See our alternate versions below!) The stress of performing silly stunts, combined with the ""strategy"" of sabotaging your opponents with aggressive pours, and now you have yourself a challenge! Hilarity ensues around the table with all players laughing and waiting for the next round to begin.  Feeling confident? Good luck!</div>

<p>During the first 2 weeks, we developed a functional prototype, created, designed, and printed our challenge cards, die, SUNK tank, and base.  We burned through many, many versions of each before submitting our idea into the Hasbro challenge.  2 weeks later, we were notified that we were selected as a top 5 finalist in the contest.  Wait what??  We were pretty excited to say the least, but now the real work had to begin.  </p>
<p>With 15 days remaining to prepare this crowdfunding campaign we still had a lot of work to do. We needed to make this product viable and polished.  15 days of hard work and late nights have brought us to this point and to the product you see today.

The Game:
SUNK! is a social skill and action game requiring a steady hand, impenetrable concentration, and sharp wits combined with an appetite for suspense and intense laughter.  SUNK!:

Social Game with tons of interaction
Skill is required to pour carefully while performing silly stunts
Sabotage is fully encouraged!  Can I screw up my opponents by pushing my turn to the limit?

Geared to anyone from ages 5 and up (how about an adult version??), the goal of the game is to add water to the cup without causing it to sink. Seem simple enough?  Can you pour 1 drop while hopping on one leg or 2 drops with one eye closed??  What if the base starts shaking?? (See our alternate versions below!) The stress of performing silly stunts, combined with the ""strategy"" of sabotaging your opponents with aggressive pours, and now you have yourself a challenge! Hilarity ensues around the table with all players laughing and waiting for the next round to begin.  Feeling confident? Good luck!





Object:

Don’t sink the cup!! Steady yourself, pour, but beware of taunting and distracting opponents, as breaking YOUR concentration is a surefire way for the other players to survive in this game. A player is eliminated once they have sunk the Float Cup in the Sunk Tank, thus removing them from the rotation of the game. The remaining players will empty the Float Cup and continue the rotation with the other participants. This rotation will continue until there is only one player remaining. The final remaining player is the winner of the game and SUNK champion!
Full Game set includes:  SUNK! Tank, Float cup, special die, and over 100 challenge cards
Challenge Cards and Dice

A few examples of the coated challenge cards (Currently over 100 Available):


Hop on one foot while pouring 2 drops
Pour 3 drops with your opposite hand
Pant like a dog while pouring 2 drops
Blank cards included so you can come up with your own party challenges!


Depending on the roll of the die, you may have to:

Pour 1 drop
Pour 2 drops
Pour 3 drops
Reverse (R)- Play switches directions
Skip (X) - Skip your current turn and pass your turn to next player
Challenge (C) - Take your chances and pick a challenge card





******WARNING---Good Times Ahead---Adults Only****** Having a party?  Grab your friends, a drink and try a different way to play!  You know what we mean ;-) so be sure you have our personalized SUNK! shot glasses (see perks below) handy when it's time to play!  Could you even fill the SUNK! tank with a special beverage?  The possibilities are endless and we promise we won't tell.

The aim was to create a game that we enjoyed playing, while at the same time it could serve a greater purpose by providing foremost an education and reward system for vaccination.</p><p>However, it was crucial for us to create a game worth playing for adults as well. It was key to have good character design, game mechanics and aesthetics that were build to maximize the fun value. and through many hours of discussion and play testing they are very excited to release this innovative game.</p><p><strong>Help us build it and join the herd.</strong></p><p>During this launch, we are providing backers with the chance to receive the full vaxcards set.

The aim was to create a game that we enjoyed playing, while at the same time it could serve a greater purpose by providing foremost an education and reward system for vaccination.However, it was crucial for us to create a game worth playing for adults as well. It was key to have good character design, game mechanics and aesthetics that were build to maximize the fun value. and through many hours of discussion and play testing they are very excited to release this innovative game.Help us build it and join the herd.During this launch, we are providing backers with the chance to receive the full vaxcards set. In the future, we plan to translate this to many languages and hopefully distribute alongside vaccination programs that need the education and reward for vaccination the most. We also wish to create expansions into other fields of medicine for gamifying education on other topics.So we are currently building a funding model that will allow us in phase two after our launch to widely distribute core components of the game to focused areas requiring education.

<p><strong>Lamentations of the Flame Princess presents Horror Among Thieves by Kelvin Green</strong></p>
<p>""The Tenebrous Hand don't rule the city, but they may as well. If they can't bribe you, they can sneak into your home and threaten you and yours. That's why they get away with it. But you know what I think’s fishy? No one's seen one of their men for a while. No one's been collecting the protection money and I've got this constable mate who says that there aren't so many robberies these days. I’ll tell you another thing: he also says that the people in charge are more worried than ever, because if a thief's going through your pockets, you at least know where he is, you know what I mean? And you’ve got to wonder, if the Hand really are gone, then what’s happened to all their loot?""</p>
<p><strong>About the Author</strong><br/> Kelvin Green is a regular artist for both the comic series Too Much Sex &amp; Violence and the old school roleplaying magazine Fight On! He has also drawn all sorts of gribbly things for The Girly Comic, The B/X Companion, The O Men, PJANG! and the upcoming Petty Gods and Dwimmermount Codex. As a writer he has contributed to NintendoLife, has been a regular at Comics Bulletin for years, created the Call of Cthulhu scenario ""Dinner With Susan"" and was one of the winners in both the 2011 and 2012 One Page Dungeon contests, despite not submitting a proper dungeon either time. His favourite roleplaying game is Call of Cthulhu. Or maybe Pendragon. Or Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay. Kelvin lurks in Brighton on England's allegedly sunny south coast, waiting for a chance to backstab a seagull for triple damage.<br/><br/><a href=""http://junkopia.net/kelvinsdirtybits/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://junkopia.net/kelvinsdirtybits/index.html</a><br/><a href=""http://brightonandhoveroleplayers.blogspot.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://brightonandhoveroleplayers.blogspot.co.uk/</a></p>

<p><strong>About the Campaigns</strong></p>
<p>The ""Extras"" aka ""What I Would Do With This"" sheets are each a single A5 sheet written by James Edward Raggi IV advising how he would change an adventure to give it a different sort of twist or fit into his own campaign.</p>
<p>There are risks for choosing bundle options - if the project you chose the bundle options on does not fund, you'd end up with nothing. If fewer than expected adventures fund, you're paying more than you would have by contributing to each adventure individually. Be aware of how you are contributing and what cost/benefit ratio you're willing to risk.</p>
<p>The perks above the single adventure levels are leaps of faith representing a desire to help get things funded and a hope of a better deal - but this is crowdfunding, we cannot guarantee results.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Pembrooktonshire Gardening Society?</strong></p>
<p>That's the LotFP Fan and Discount club. It costs 10€ to join (+23% VAT for EU orders), and you get a 1€ discount on all print products in the LotFP store forever. Sometimes other benefits too, like saving $50 on an exclusive hardcover set in these campaigns. Details on joining the Society <a href=""http://www.lotfp.com/store/index.php?route=product/product&amp;path=40&amp;product_id=71"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Where Does the Money Go?</strong></p>
<p>Two-thirds of the money goes to the talent working on the project: The writer, artist, graphic designer, editor. The rest goes towards printing and shipping (and IndieGoGo's fees). The exact figure varies depending on how many of which perks are chosen, but LotFP will not begin making money on these projects until they hit $7000. LotFP's profits will (hopefully) come after the adventures are released and you all start raving about how cool the adventures are so the non-hardcore supporters go for them.</p>
<p><strong>Other Notes</strong></p>
<p><strong>July 10 Update</strong>:<br/> (see the July 10 entry in the Updates tab for more info on these points)<br/> All funded adventures will include a PDF supplement with conversions to the ""OGL 3.PF"" rules system.<br/> A new funding level has been added: The 3.PF Faithful, with all these conversion notes and stats included in their own booklet<br/> New perks and information for The Faithful and Collecting Faithful levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you go in for The Faithful level or above, and that adventure is the only one that funds, you will receive a 100€ coupon for the LotFP store. If only that and one other funds, you will receive a 50€ coupon.</li>
<li>An exclusive 64 page adventure by James Edward Raggi IV. This adventure will never again be printed in this format (only an abridged 32 or 48 page version in the future), only those pledging at the Faithful or Collecting Faithful levels on funded adventures will receive it. There will be no PDF version of this adventure. This adventure does not count against the ones mentioned in the previous bullet point. It will be included in your Collecting Faithful package but will not be a hardcover inside the slipcase.</li>
<li>A booklet with all of the ""How I Would Fit This Into My Campaign"" sheets, with cover art by Zak S (Vornheim, Playing D&amp;D With Porn Stars, etc), will be included with these perks (will not be made as a hardcover for the slipcase).</li>
</ul><p>For the Grab Bags, you may choose which adventures you want.<br/> A new perk: ""Retail Support"" has been added<br/> Three random Collector-level contributors on funded projects will get to have a character of their choice drawn by Jez Gordon in a situation from a funded adventure of their choice, with this art appearing in the Extras booklet.<br/><strong>(end July 10 Update)</strong></p>
<p>It is our intention to go to press in late November/early December. However, with a potential 19 authors and 18 artists involved, someone is likely to be late so the adventures may not ship out until the new year.</p>
<p>Some of the adventures in these campaigns will be for ages 18+ because of (im)mature content, so be aware of that before contributing to any adventures or multi-adventure perks. If you want to double-check whether any individual adventure will be an 18+ affair, leave a note in the comments and we'll get back to you shortly.</p>

""Overflow"" from one project cannot be transferred to another. Consider your choice to contribute carefully and be sure you mean it before you hit that payment button.
If you contribute and it doesn't fund, YOU GET IT FOR FREE ANYWAY! (PDF at $10+ contribution, print at $20+) See the July 22 update for full details.
July 23 Update: $30+ contributions get a 16 page sandbox setting by Rob S Conley (Majestic Wilderlands, Points of Light 1 & 2, etc.) in print + pdf as an added Extra. Not to be released in any form outside these campaigns. Grab Bag contributions get to choose their adventures (up to 6). $160+ get an exclusive 64 page James Edward Raggi IV LotFP adventure.

Lamentations of the Flame Princess presents Horror Among Thieves by Kelvin Green
""The Tenebrous Hand don't rule the city, but they may as well. If they can't bribe you, they can sneak into your home and threaten you and yours. That's why they get away with it. But you know what I think’s fishy? No one's seen one of their men for a while. No one's been collecting the protection money and I've got this constable mate who says that there aren't so many robberies these days. I’ll tell you another thing: he also says that the people in charge are more worried than ever, because if a thief's going through your pockets, you at least know where he is, you know what I mean? And you’ve got to wonder, if the Hand really are gone, then what’s happened to all their loot?""
About the Author Kelvin Green is a regular artist for both the comic series Too Much Sex & Violence and the old school roleplaying magazine Fight On! He has also drawn all sorts of gribbly things for The Girly Comic, The B/X Companion, The O Men, PJANG! and the upcoming Petty Gods and Dwimmermount Codex. As a writer he has contributed to NintendoLife, has been a regular at Comics Bulletin for years, created the Call of Cthulhu scenario ""Dinner With Susan"" and was one of the winners in both the 2011 and 2012 One Page Dungeon contests, despite not submitting a proper dungeon either time. His favourite roleplaying game is Call of Cthulhu. Or maybe Pendragon. Or Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay. Kelvin lurks in Brighton on England's allegedly sunny south coast, waiting for a chance to backstab a seagull for triple damage.http://junkopia.net/kelvinsdirtybits/index.htmlhttp://brightonandhoveroleplayers.blogspot.co.uk/
About LotFP LotFP is the publisher of Weird Fantasy Role-Playing, a horror-fantasy tabletop RPG. It is a second-generation retro-clone, which means that adventures compatible with LotFP are also compatible with over a dozen different games.

About the Campaigns
The ""Extras"" aka ""What I Would Do With This"" sheets are each a single A5 sheet written by James Edward Raggi IV advising how he would change an adventure to give it a different sort of twist or fit into his own campaign.
There are risks for choosing bundle options - if the project you chose the bundle options on does not fund, you'd end up with nothing. If fewer than expected adventures fund, you're paying more than you would have by contributing to each adventure individually. Be aware of how you are contributing and what cost/benefit ratio you're willing to risk.
The perks above the single adventure levels are leaps of faith representing a desire to help get things funded and a hope of a better deal - but this is crowdfunding, we cannot guarantee results.
What is the Pembrooktonshire Gardening Society?
That's the LotFP Fan and Discount club. It costs 10€ to join (+23% VAT for EU orders), and you get a 1€ discount on all print products in the LotFP store forever. Sometimes other benefits too, like saving $50 on an exclusive hardcover set in these campaigns. Details on joining the Society here.
Where Does the Money Go?
Two-thirds of the money goes to the talent working on the project: The writer, artist, graphic designer, editor. The rest goes towards printing and shipping (and IndieGoGo's fees). The exact figure varies depending on how many of which perks are chosen, but LotFP will not begin making money on these projects until they hit $7000. LotFP's profits will (hopefully) come after the adventures are released and you all start raving about how cool the adventures are so the non-hardcore supporters go for them.
Other Notes
July 10 Update: (see the July 10 entry in the Updates tab for more info on these points) All funded adventures will include a PDF supplement with conversions to the ""OGL 3.PF"" rules system. A new funding level has been added: The 3.PF Faithful, with all these conversion notes and stats included in their own booklet New perks and information for The Faithful and Collecting Faithful levels:

If you go in for The Faithful level or above, and that adventure is the only one that funds, you will receive a 100€ coupon for the LotFP store. If only that and one other funds, you will receive a 50€ coupon.
An exclusive 64 page adventure by James Edward Raggi IV. This adventure will never again be printed in this format (only an abridged 32 or 48 page version in the future), only those pledging at the Faithful or Collecting Faithful levels on funded adventures will receive it. There will be no PDF version of this adventure. This adventure does not count against the ones mentioned in the previous bullet point. It will be included in your Collecting Faithful package but will not be a hardcover inside the slipcase.
A booklet with all of the ""How I Would Fit This Into My Campaign"" sheets, with cover art by Zak S (Vornheim, Playing D&D With Porn Stars, etc), will be included with these perks (will not be made as a hardcover for the slipcase).
For the Grab Bags, you may choose which adventures you want. A new perk: ""Retail Support"" has been added Three random Collector-level contributors on funded projects will get to have a character of their choice drawn by Jez Gordon in a situation from a funded adventure of their choice, with this art appearing in the Extras booklet.(end July 10 Update)
It is our intention to go to press in late November/early December. However, with a potential 19 authors and 18 artists involved, someone is likely to be late so the adventures may not ship out until the new year.
Some of the adventures in these campaigns will be for ages 18+ because of (im)mature content, so be aware of that before contributing to any adventures or multi-adventure perks. If you want to double-check whether any individual adventure will be an 18+ affair, leave a note in the comments and we'll get back to you shortly.
Adventure titles are all subject to change although I'll roast the authors' bits if they turn in something ridiculously different than their supplied description.
All prices include first class shipping from Finland, or a tracked parcel if your stuff comes out to over 1kg.
Each adventure is scheduled to be an A5 sized 32 page book and would retail for 10€-13€ ($13.00-$16.00 depending on exchange rates) not including taxes or shipping. The $20 single copy purchase price is the best approximation of the price including first class shipping worldwide but the real amount may or may not match that. Some adventures, depending on the adventure structures, may be more than 32 pages.
Each funded adventure will have a full print run done for distribution.
The author of a funded adventure will get 10% of all money raised above the $7000 mark, and the artist will get 5% of all money raised above that amount, in addition to their agreed-on fees. Additional profits go into the LotFP war chest.",0.0,0,"9 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey guys, I am Gabriel. I am currently a young student and about 30 days ago, I got a free trial for a program called Unity. Unity allows you to develop video games and while I have had some previous experience with the program, so I decided to try and use those 30 days of free trialing to develop a game for iOS devices. I got really into it, and before you know it, BAM! My trial ended! I can no longer work on the game. All hopes were lost! But, wait, I smell, help! And here you are reading my Indiegogo project! The game that I am working is called Rollé (Pronounced: Roll -ay). The game is a marble rolling game, where you roll the ball through a series of challenging obstable courses. The thing that I think makes this game different from other games is not only the courses and the art, but the fact that it uses virtual joysticks on the iOS device, which makes things easiar to control. I do plan on supporting accelerometer in the future. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So the basic license fee for Unity iOS is $400. I am asking for $500 simply because that is the minimum. The money will go directly into paying for the license so I can get right back into development. After recieving and then purchasing the license, I will continue testing a development and send my contributors several copies of the game. If you contribute enough, you can even design your own level to appear on the release version of the game. Contributors will also recieve the game with customs level (And optionally, a custom ball character)</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>You'll be helping a kid make his hopes come true, and getting some good in return! </p>
<p>If you would like, I have included a link to try desktop versions of the un completed game. Thank you very much for taking a look at my project!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>P.S. You can download an alpha copy of the game for Windows/Mac computers at </p>

<p>Beyond the fact to reclaim their place as King and Queen, they must  find their answers. Their answer to ensure the destiny of Zama against the ideological conflicts of their world.</p>

<p>The world where the game takes place is called Auriona (yes we like it simply lol). <span class=""null"">It's formed by six continents</span>. Antoria The Enzo’s continent was spared by the geopolitical game that maintains a delicate balance between all the others… until now.</p>

<p>Those who use it in combat can increase their strength and have access to unprecedented fighting techniques for a brief moment.<br/> However, these techniques seem to ""come from somewhere else."" The Warriors hear voices of their ancestors in combat, so the fighting art of the Aurion is called <strong>Legacy</strong>.</p>
<p>The Aurion can be seen as a living form of energy which exists on another astral plan.</p>
<p>An Aurion comes from the sum of emotions and thoughts of one or more individuals, and can be completed in, progressively generations by generations of the same family. That is the concept of <strong>Legacy</strong>.</p>

<p>We arrived so far as the Spartans (as you can see in the video). We use paper and old …no, very old PC (and we prefer to not explain you how we make our lightened table…).</p>
<p>So it is becoming important for us to raise funds to equip and work under normal conditions. Imagine what we will be able to create !!</p>
<h3><em><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">                                  The budget :</span></strong></em></h3>
<p>The Main investment of the studio is on the good way by venture capital. During this month of August many private investors have started to give funds to garantee the release of the game.</p>

<p>Beyond a simple game, it is a part of video game history that you will write with us: the birth of Kiro'o.</p>
<p>Years ago young geniuses have created the manga, comics. Others created the space opera, science fiction, etc. and nothing since.</p>
<p> We want to create the new Eldorado of the imagination by defining through our games a new graphic, audio and even narrative benchmark: the kiro'o tales.</p>

<p>Support us and when history will talk about this, you will say :  </p>
<p>“I was there when it started. I am one of those who carried this 10-year story on the final meters.”</p>
<p> We really hope that you will be with us for this last step to ensure that we offer the masterpiece for which we gave everything.</p>

<h3><em><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">                                  FAQ :</span></strong></em></h3>
<h5><br/></h5>
<h4>Question 1: Why there is not a trailer with in-game phase? </h4>
<p>If you watch our Pitch video with the studio's story, you will understand that the studio is in creation process. The new team is pre-recruited but they will be available at full time when the physical studio will be set-up with all the equipment.</p>
<p>We have done all this works with no equipment, without even a graphic tablet. It is impossible to make good animation for our game engine in these conditions</p>
<p>But we have already wanted to share our works and concepts and get feedbacks before starting the real crunching works. You can say that we are at the early stage development.</p>
<p>That's why the team produced fixed screenshots, but by following real gamedesign process. All the materials were done to be available for the real game.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>Question 2: But if the studio is not set-up yet, how will you be able to create this game, with this gameplay in 9 month? </h4>
<p>I dedicate this answer to my friends of JOL. As you have seen in the pitch video of our studio's  story we have created 2 versions of the game before</p>
<p>Each previous versions of AURION had a purpose on our gamedesign ""training"" process  to be sure to have what it takes, to create the 1st pro version of AURION.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://img96.xooimage.com/files/b/1/6/werawi-4090919.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As described in this pictures above, consider that AURION in 2014 will be a HD graphical conversion of the amateur version AURION that we were coding since 2 years. We were amateur only because we were using graphics of others games. But we already have all the project management and game programmation experience (for  2D games)<br/></p>
<p>Our previous versions was playable, and a demo was released and tested by our fans in february 2013. There were not combats, but the  conceptions was already ok, and we were on the coding phase before we decided to jump on pro stage. </p></span></span></div>","Believe in the Potential ...

Kiro'o is coming from the word  « Kiroho Maono » in Swahili which means « spiritual Vision ».
Hi everyone,
Since 10 years I (Madiba) works to create the perfect RPG. Perfection lies on the emotion and inspiration the game will provides to players.So I decided to build myself on the following areas :

Improve and master my programming skills at the university
Become a good narrator : I wrote a novel
 Learning how to create an innovative gameplay but within the limits of feasibility.
Become a team leader : I create a company in my country.

In 2003, I started this journey with the game project AURION, which had several versions since. I preferred to improve the same project to keep the soul of the game and give the player a masterpiece when ready.Many people have taken part in this journey, wonderful people who gives themselves to my dream. Today, a professional team of 20, is finally ready to create this great game based on African myths. 

 All we need now, is someone special, the last member of the kiro'o team: YOU.
 






                                  Story  Pitch:
Enzo Kori-Odan, prince of Zama, undergoes a putsh from his brother in law on the day of his crowning and marriage with Erine Evou. Enzo and Erine are then exiled by the traitor.

The Weeding and crowning of Enzo and Erine
 The young fallen couple decides so to travel the world to acquire the Kori-Odan’s warrior Legacy in order to regain their throne. In their quest, they will realize the existential and geopolitical dilemmas behind the putsh they have faced.
 
Beyond the fact to reclaim their place as King and Queen, they must  find their answers. Their answer to ensure the destiny of Zama against the ideological conflicts of their world.
                                  The World :
The world where the game takes place is called Auriona (yes we like it simply lol). It's formed by six continents. Antoria The Enzo’s continent was spared by the geopolitical game that maintains a delicate balance between all the others… until now.
 
Every nation suffers in his own way the consequences of a widespread selfishness and their cultures will put Enzo and Erine in face of ideological dilemmas that constitute their initiatic path to maturity.
                                  Aurion :
The Aurion is both a mystery and evidence on the planet Auriona. This energy appeared long ago, and it manifests itself in many ways in daily life (combat, crafts, etc.).
 
Enzo gathering his Legacy throught the 1st AURION. 22 Aurionic states will be available
Those who use it in combat can increase their strength and have access to unprecedented fighting techniques for a brief moment. However, these techniques seem to ""come from somewhere else."" The Warriors hear voices of their ancestors in combat, so the fighting art of the Aurion is called Legacy.
The Aurion can be seen as a living form of energy which exists on another astral plan.
An Aurion comes from the sum of emotions and thoughts of one or more individuals, and can be completed in, progressively generations by generations of the same family. That is the concept of Legacy.
 
                                  Gameplay (Gamer spirit Design !!) :
Our goal is to create an Action RPG in high definition  2D graphics. We are inspired by “tales of destiny” in the form but we will provide plenty of innovation and dynamism :
 - Horizontal Exploration in beautiful scenery with possible vertical movement (as in the classic beat them all of Snes)

Walk, run
Jump, wall jump, climb
swim
Feed your characters while respecting their culinary tastes to make them evolve faster.
etc.

 
-  Epic and strategic Real-Time Fighting!!

Facing enemies with Enzo and the support of Erine
Visual evolutive Combos !!
Several allies to recruit during  your journey
Gather your Legacy ,merge the Aurions,  to create new (22 aurionical transformations can be done !)
Touching duels with immersive fighting dialogs.
A new generation of events that will surpass the classic QTE: The Cognitives Battles Event

 

 

 

-  Many great secondary activities !!

One guild for secondary quests
loot and item crafting
Hunt rare monsters and create your equipment with their aurionical essences.
And so many other cool stuff!!

 
 
  

We arrived so far as the Spartans (as you can see in the video). We use paper and old …no, very old PC (and we prefer to not explain you how we make our lightened table…).
So it is becoming important for us to raise funds to equip and work under normal conditions. Imagine what we will be able to create !!
                                  The budget :
The Main investment of the studio is on the good way by venture capital. During this month of August many private investors have started to give funds to garantee the release of the game.
 You can also check that we are selected on the investment fundraising website there for exemple: 
 So there is what we need from the campaign now to give a best quality to the game




 
  The Rewards you will earn !!!There you can have a look on some of these cool Rewards stuff you will have




                                  Beyond the Game :
Beyond a simple game, it is a part of video game history that you will write with us: the birth of Kiro'o.
Years ago young geniuses have created the manga, comics. Others created the space opera, science fiction, etc. and nothing since.
 We want to create the new Eldorado of the imagination by defining through our games a new graphic, audio and even narrative benchmark: the kiro'o tales.

Support us and when history will talk about this, you will say :  
“I was there when it started. I am one of those who carried this 10-year story on the final meters.”
 We really hope that you will be with us for this last step to ensure that we offer the masterpiece for which we gave everything.
 

 
 Check all the perks details below:
Consider you are now at the gates of Zama, the next step of your story depends on your move.

 



 

 

 


 

 

 

 
 

 
If you can't back us, you can however support us by sharing our campaign near you. Bring everyone there.
Thanks, #Kiro'o Team

# UPDATE 1:
You can ask question about the project on crowdfundingforum in our thread there, thanks to them to help us with this very helpfull tools.



                                  FAQ :

Question 1: Why there is not a trailer with in-game phase? 
If you watch our Pitch video with the studio's story, you will understand that the studio is in creation process. The new team is pre-recruited but they will be available at full time when the physical studio will be set-up with all the equipment.
We have done all this works with no equipment, without even a graphic tablet. It is impossible to make good animation for our game engine in these conditions
But we have already wanted to share our works and concepts and get feedbacks before starting the real crunching works. You can say that we are at the early stage development.
That's why the team produced fixed screenshots, but by following real gamedesign process. All the materials were done to be available for the real game.

Question 2: But if the studio is not set-up yet, how will you be able to create this game, with this gameplay in 9 month? 
I dedicate this answer to my friends of JOL. As you have seen in the pitch video of our studio's  story we have created 2 versions of the game before
Each previous versions of AURION had a purpose on our gamedesign ""training"" process  to be sure to have what it takes, to create the 1st pro version of AURION.

As described in this pictures above, consider that AURION in 2014 will be a HD graphical conversion of the amateur version AURION that we were coding since 2 years. We were amateur only because we were using graphics of others games. But we already have all the project management and game programmation experience (for  2D games)
Our previous versions was playable, and a demo was released and tested by our fans in february 2013. There were not combats, but the  conceptions was already ok, and we were on the coding phase before we decided to jump on pro stage.",35.0,1,"1 Campaign

<hr/><h2>Hi!</h2>
<p>We are <strong>Pi-Dev</strong> - a team of indie developers. We are 3 students, and we are interested in high-tech stuff and, very strongly, in <strong>game development</strong>.</p>
<p>We started our ""carreers"" with small <strong>hobby 2D game</strong> projects, musicmaking, web development and design. Togehter, we made a <em>tetris</em> remake, a <em>Mario</em> remake and similar sort of small games. We primarily used <strong>middleware</strong> <strong>game creation tools</strong> for this purpose.</p>
<p>But with the time we gained <strong>experience</strong>. And we decided that the tools we use do not give us enough flexibility. That bored us and we just decided to start developing a <strong>game engine</strong> that offers the <strong>flexibility we need</strong>. We started studing how a game engine works and analyzing what kind of games exist and what a decent game engine not tied to particular game actually needs.</p>
<h2>Then we started the project pi|engine.</h2>
<p><strong>pi|engine </strong>is a game creator for you. It’s fast, it has its own development environment, and the games from it will work on your desktop, your macbook, your smartphone and even your game console. It has been a secret for two years, now we are ready to go public and amaze you. Oh, did I mention it’s not just a <em>planned</em> thing, but an <em>actual</em>, almost-<em>working </em>set of programs? </p>
<p><strong>pi|engine</strong> is different than most other game creation software and engines. Instead of producing funky kinds of data that the runtime interprets, <strong>pi|engine</strong><strong>’s CREATOR IDE</strong> is a <strong>high-level code generator</strong>. And that’s a good thing – it will make everything run rapidly.</p>
<p><strong>Now, let's get just a bit more technical than that.</strong></p>
<p>Graphics, scenes and object classes are stored in a native XML-based file format. A language exporter runs and converts the project file to an actual programming language, such as C++ or JAVA and then passes the code to the real compiler for compilation. Then it runs your game.</p>
<p>The development itself is based on <strong>the haXe </strong><strong>programming</strong><strong> language</strong><strong> </strong>and some kind of <strong>visual programming</strong><strong> </strong>will come up later. Import the assets - graphics, sounds, models, build object classes and place these in scenes.</p>
<p>There will be different kind of <strong>pre-made object templates</strong> that will help creation of common types of functionalities: FPS behaviors, artificial intelligence, inventories, shooting, physics simulations - just to name a few.</p>
<p>Empty classes will be allowed for any kind of usage for any custom object types, that makes pi|engine usable for development of <strong>any kinds of games</strong> – be it RPG, FPS, sidescroller or just a solitaire.</p>
<p>While <strong>pi|engine</strong> targets mostly 2D game development at its early youth, 3D features will definitely appear in the future, making it <strong>fully-functional</strong> <strong>multi-purpose 2D and 3D game engine</strong>.

<h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
<p>The World of Nathakra has been more than a project for the past couple of years - it has been my passion. Creating a new fantasy world from scratch has been a dream of mine for as long as I can remember.  I have been writing a book, designing a board game and a trading card game (TCG).  I have designed maps for the realm, created brand new races and formed back stories.  Furthermore I have created it all entirely from my imagination.</p>
<p>The TCG is something I have played with friends and family (printed on plain white paper with no graphics or art) and they have given me nothing but praise regarding it.  Now I am ready to try and market a full-fledged game; locally and online first and then hopefully it will expand from there. It is my ultimate dream.</p>
<p>Through your support and funding, all the money raised will go towards custom game pieces (such as the custom-made dice it requires and the cards themselves), website design and especially artwork, some of which I have completed already and can be seen below.</p>
<p>Contributors fund ideas they can be passionate about.  There is nothing I am more passionate about than this idea.  It is my hope that 20 years from now, my world will stand among the greats such as Krynn, Middle Earth or the Forgotten Realms, to name a few.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>The bulk of the funding needed is for the artwork; artists can be costly to hire and it can take quite a while to complete the pieces. Being able to hire 2 or 3 artists at once would speed up the process and offer more variety in the game.</p>
<p>Another huge chunk would be used for getting the cards themselves printed.  This is another large expense as often orders require a minimum order of 2000-10000 cards.</p>
<p>If my entire goal is not reached, the funds raised will still go directly to my hired artists and the printing of the cards, bringing me that much closer to my dream.</p>
<p>I will not lie; a creation this complex will not be complete in a flash. There are many factors to take into account.  This means that even after my campaign ends, there still may be a lot of work to do. The good news is, the 12 cards I prize most above the rest are complete and are simply awaiting an order to print.  These cards will be rare, limited cards and will be included in my featured perks.</p>
<h2><strong>$5000</strong></h2>
<p><strong>W</strong>ill allow me to complete the artwork for all cards, cover art and packaging.</p>
<h2><strong>$2000</strong></h2>
<p><strong>M</strong>ore will allow me to complete the custom dice, order the needed tokens and print the manuals</p>
<h2><strong>$1000</strong></h2>
<p>More will allow me to create a custom made website with card databases, online shops and all the little costs them come with making a game such as this such as advertising.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>Why fund ""The World of Nathakra: TCG""?  It is a unique game unlike any I have ever encountered.  It uses the same basics as many other card games but adds more strategy, cunning and luck to the fold.  This is achieved by adding dice into the card game.</p>
<p>Players build custom decks choosing a minimum of 60 cards from a large range of options such as creatures, spells, equipment and more.  They then cast their spells and summon creatures using either relic points (represented by tokens within each player’s possession) or by rolling the ""Dice of Fate"".  The harder the spell, the lower your chances of success (for instance, a black die has a 1/6 chance of succeeding).</p>
<p>Players clash until their opponents are either reduced to 0 life or they cannot draw any more cards from their deck.</p>
<p>The other great thing about my fantasy realm is that Greek mythology is woven into the story. This means that many of my cards feature Greek mythological creatures or events complete with details straight out of the legends themselves. You can learn while you play!</p>
<p>Lastly, my realm and story leaves massive room for expansion.  I already have future plans to expand into Egyptian, Celtic, and Nordic mythology, as well as the vast world of fantasy (i.e. Dwarves, Elves, Orcs, etc.)!  The possibilities are almost endless!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Break down of the game</strong></h2>
<p>The World of Nathakra TCG is a new type of card game. It introduces even more strategy, risk and chance into this type of game than ever before.  It does so by introducing dice into the card game, four different types of dice to be exact, all with different odds assigned to them.</p>
<ul>
<li>RED dice which have a 50% success rate</li>
<li>GREEN dice which have a 83% success rate</li>
<li>BLUE dice which have a 66% success rate</li>
<li>YELLOW dice which have a 33% success rate</li>
<li>BLACK dice which have a very low 16% success rate</li>
</ul><p>Each player has a custom-made deck of cards which adhere to the standard rules of card games; these will be explained later on in this booklet.</p>
<p>Each player begins the game with 15 life and 5 Relic Power points (RP) which are represented by 5 counters that each players receives.  Each player shuffles their deck and then draws 5 cards from the top of their own deck.  The game then proceeds with players casting spells, summoning creatures etc. They do this by using a combination of RP and rolling the Dice of Fate until there is only one left standing, <strong>the</strong> <strong>Nathakra Relic Master</strong>.  A player loses either by having his or her life reduced to 0 or has no more cards to draw from his or her own deck. </p>
<p align=""center"">****</p>
<p align=""center""><em>The fate of The World of Nathakra lies in the balance.  Will you save it from the ever approaching evil? Or will you leap forward into the darkness bringing the entire Realm with you…</em></p>
<p align=""center""><em>The Relic Master is the only one who can determine the answers and he alone will determine the fate of all...</em></p>

Why fund ""The World of Nathakra: TCG""?  It is a unique game unlike any I have ever encountered.  It uses the same basics as many other card games but adds more strategy, cunning and luck to the fold.  This is achieved by adding dice into the card game.
Players build custom decks choosing a minimum of 60 cards from a large range of options such as creatures, spells, equipment and more.  They then cast their spells and summon creatures using either relic points (represented by tokens within each player’s possession) or by rolling the ""Dice of Fate"".  The harder the spell, the lower your chances of success (for instance, a black die has a 1/6 chance of succeeding).
Players clash until their opponents are either reduced to 0 life or they cannot draw any more cards from their deck.
The other great thing about my fantasy realm is that Greek mythology is woven into the story. This means that many of my cards feature Greek mythological creatures or events complete with details straight out of the legends themselves. You can learn while you play!
Lastly, my realm and story leaves massive room for expansion.  I already have future plans to expand into Egyptian, Celtic, and Nordic mythology, as well as the vast world of fantasy (i.e. Dwarves, Elves, Orcs, etc.)!  The possibilities are almost endless!
 
Break down of the game
The World of Nathakra TCG is a new type of card game. It introduces even more strategy, risk and chance into this type of game than ever before.  It does so by introducing dice into the card game, four different types of dice to be exact, all with different odds assigned to them.

RED dice which have a 50% success rate
GREEN dice which have a 83% success rate
BLUE dice which have a 66% success rate
YELLOW dice which have a 33% success rate
BLACK dice which have a very low 16% success rate
Each player has a custom-made deck of cards which adhere to the standard rules of card games; these will be explained later on in this booklet.
Each player begins the game with 15 life and 5 Relic Power points (RP) which are represented by 5 counters that each players receives.  Each player shuffles their deck and then draws 5 cards from the top of their own deck.  The game then proceeds with players casting spells, summoning creatures etc. They do this by using a combination of RP and rolling the Dice of Fate until there is only one left standing, the Nathakra Relic Master.  A player loses either by having his or her life reduced to 0 or has no more cards to draw from his or her own deck. 
****
The fate of The World of Nathakra lies in the balance.  Will you save it from the ever approaching evil? Or will you leap forward into the darkness bringing the entire Realm with you…
The Relic Master is the only one who can determine the answers and he alone will determine the fate of all...

Can't chip in right now? There Are Other Ways You Can Help
Spreading the word of my idea is an invaluable source to me.  The more people know about the game and are interested in it, the better chance it has to succeed.  Posting it on Facebook, Twitter, or other sites like it is of great help to me.
Anything you can do to help me reach for my ultimate dream would be unbelievable.  It truly is my passion.  Comments, feedback, suggestions even plain old criticism can be sent via my website www.nathakra.com or e-mailed directly to rmgpstudios@gmail.com

<p><b>Why crowdfunding?</b></p>
<p align=""justify"">After the
release of the ultimate Lizardmen Team and the ultimate Kaos Dwarf Team, Meiko <span>Miniatures new project is the ultimate Ratmen
Team. We have been showing the initial greens of this team. All these greens received
good reviews from our customers, so we decided to go on with the project. This
team will include: 4 Gutter Runners, 2 Blitzers, 2 Throwers, 4 Linemen, 1 Rat
Ogre and 5 Star Players: Hamflek with Two Heads, Klark Smash with
Strength 4 and three optional Claws, Fechglitz with Ball and Chain, Skipper the
Assassin and the Rat Ogre Headsmasher. Also, this campaign will include
several more items: racial Turn Counter, Ratmen Plastic Gaming Mat, racial Range
Ruler, racial d6 Dice, </span><span>racial Football,</span> Ratmen Mutation Sprues… </p>
<p align=""justify"">The sculpting of most of these miniatures has already
been made. But we need your help to speed up the casting process. That way, we
will be able to release the Meiko Ratmen Team much sooner than what was
initially planned. Using Indiegogo as a platform to rise funds helps us a lot
since we can finance new miniatures and other interesting items, obtain
feedback from our customers and it gives us confidence to keep working
on. In exchange you will get some cool rewards.</p>
<p align=""justify"">All the miniatures will be casted in metal, including
the Ratmen Turn Counter. The master moulds will be made by Miniaturas Alemany,
the mouldmaker of other successful Fantasy Football Indiegogo campaigns like the
Chaos Team and the 2 Halfling Teams of Willy Miniatures. </p>
<p align=""justify""><span>Pedro Ramos (a.k.a. Poncho) is the
skilled sculptor of all the miniatures of the Meiko Ratmen. He has also sculpted
the Ratmen Turn Counter and the Ratmen football, two great accessories for a
great team. Pedro Ramos is currently considered by many Fantasy Football fans
as one of the best Fantasy Football sculptors worldwide. His sculpting style
specially fits with the Ratmen race, since he has a special gift to give shape

</div></div>","My name is Csaba Marosi. I’m a 23-year-old
college student in Budapest. I’ve been developing ’Defend Your Kingdom’ for
circa six months, and this is my first project for commercial use. I designed
the graphics and wrote the code all by myself. The creation consumes a lot of
time, energy and money; that’s why I’m asking for your help. My dream is that once I will establish my own indie gaming company, The Burning Pick Entertainment. Your donation would help to that dream come true.


’Defend Your Kingdom’ is a unique fantasy mobile game where you need skills of dexterity, strategy, and stamina! In this software I tried to unite popular puzzle games and strategy defence games.


The screen is divided into two parts. The bigger
lower part is a simple puzzle game; basically we can interact with the game and
control our hero on this surface. The task is to build a big triangle out of
four same-coloured stones. After that, the four same coloured stones merge into

upper part, there is a constant wave of evil creatures trying to kill your
wizard. With these triangles, your wizard can cast spells to attack or set back
the forces of hell. On higher levels, you can combine the stones for stronger
spells.                                                        Example: Earth +Fire + Life = Stone
GuardianThe
game ends when the wizard dies. The main objective of the game is evolving. When you reach higher levels, you can unlock more abilities, gears, and allies to help
you set back the enemy for a longer time.The Stages
Jungle, Northern Sea, Desert, and Mystical
swamp. From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak, fight with your mage against the
hordes of evil.The game includes 10(+1 tutorial) stages, where you will need
different tactics for victory. To unlock the next stage you have to survive
for a given time. It never will be easy.  Fine tactics, dexterity, and the proper level of the mage will be necessary to win.
Enemies
and allies            

The waves of enemies will ensure you to
never use the same strategy since every stage has new opponents with diverse
abilities to threat the peace of the realm. 

          

Luckily, you are not alone in this epic war. With your magic power, you can summon skeletons, stone giants or even mesmerize enemies to attack their own. First of all, your most loyal companion is Fenrir, the direwolf.     


During the adventures,
you have to learn a lot. Killing monsters and perform powerful spells gives you experience points.After
reaching a level, you receive an upgrade point. There are 40 talent points in
total; you can use it in a talent tree to Learn new spells, upgrade previous
ones, or you can also spend them on your direwolf.              You can loot not only

<strong>Create History</strong></span><br/><br/>Welcome to one of the most ambitious massively multiplayer online games currently under independent development. A game of total freedom - and its consequences. Set in a low-fantasy medieval world (similar to <em>Game of Thrones</em>), <em>Might &amp; Fealty</em> offers you tense battles, the building of great cities, and political intrigue and betrayal that will decide the fate of nations<em>. </em>Equal parts strategy, roleplaying, and sandbox, this game has a world that will be shaped by its players and their choices, and a history that will be created by them as they play<em>.</em><p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Updates:</b></p>
<p>We are currently running a <b>closed alpha test</b> for all funders. If you become a funder, you will get an invite key to join the alpha. See the updates tab or the forum (link at the bottom of the page) for details.</p>
<p>Budget details have been added below.<br/></p>
<p><br/><br/><span class=""bbc_size"" style=""font-size: 1.35em;""><strong>Gameplay and Setting: Freedom and Consequences</strong></span><br/><br/>In<em> Might &amp; Fealty</em>, players take the role of one or more nobles, all of whom are active in one persistent sandbox world similar to that of our own Middle Ages. You will march, form armies, conquer villages, build them into towns or cities; swear fealty to and fight alongside a large number of other players and possibly even create kingdoms. The point where other games end is the point where <em>Might &amp; Fealty</em> really begins:<br/><br/>This game is all about empowering you to play as you want to play, and allowing you to make infinite choices. But every choice comes with consquences. Choosing to be a hero to some, might make you a villain to others. Natural resources are inherently limited, so choosing to expand your villages will mean someone else gets less. Choose to be a loyal friend or choose the path of betrayal. Choose to spread your holdings by sword, - or by trade and diplomacy. Choose to be a loving spouse or an unfaithful lover. Infinite choices, but always with consequences.<br/><br/>Play as a landless knight who wanders the world, a small-time lord, or the monarch of a huge kingdom. Get married, have children, and see your family stretch through generations. Choose any path you want, and it all depends on your skills and nothing else. <em>Might &amp; Fealty</em> will never block your ambitions - but other players might! Interaction with other players is the core of the gameplay, and they all have their own ambitions and choices to make. Best of all, every player will create their own unique story as they play and that will be recorded in the game world. There will be a living, evolving, history that is made by the players as they play.</p>
<p><br/><br/><img alt=""our heraldry designer"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9638874/maf/heraldry.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/><span class=""bbc_size"" style=""font-size: 1.35em;""><strong>Highlights</strong></span></p>
<ul class=""bbc_list"">
<li>
<strong>Economy</strong><br/>Manage villages, towns, and cities with options to construct more than 30 unique building types, including weaponsmiths, archery schools, mines, alchemists, town halls, temples, and more! Trade and build within an economic system designed to balance itself so you don't need to constantly micro-manage everything. Defend your towns by constructing walls, towers, and castles. Will you be happy with wooden palisades or will your goal be the mighty stone castle?</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""bbc_list"">
<li>
<strong>Evolving History</strong><br/>Everything that happens shapes the game world, and it's all recorded on an in-game history.  Your actions in the game become part of the history of the world, and that history is never lost. Sophisticated options allow research into the past of characters, cities, or Empires.</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""bbc_list"">
<li>
<strong>Military</strong><br/>From recruitment to funeral, your army is more than a collection of statistics, and it will travel the world with you. The game models individual soldiers, down to them having names and a home to return to when their tour of duty is over. Want to know how Hans fared in the last battle? This game will tell you. Total freedom to customize every soldier with a combination of different types of weapons and armour, including swords; axes; spears; shields; javelins; bows; leather, scale, or plate armour; and the feared warhorses. Recruit NPC specialists to your warband, such as scouts, spies, prospectors, heralds, merchants, and more - each with unique abilities.</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""bbc_list"">
<li>
<strong>Politics</strong><br/>An entirely free-form hierarchy system unlike anything you've ever seen before: built around oaths of fealty entered into by nobles of different players - or even between those nobles you yourself control. Build your relationships with other players in any way you want: You will need others to fight beside you - or to fight for! Have your holdings form a county, a duchy, a barony, a kingdom or an empire with hundreds of other players as your vassals. Plot, scheme, fight, or marry your way to power! Your social skills will be as important as your gaming skills if you want other players to support your ambitions.</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""bbc_list"">
<li>
<strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9638874/maf/map4.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>Sophisticated Maps</strong><br/>Might &amp; Fealty uses one of the most powerful mapping systems you've ever seen in a game. It uses real geography and there is huge scope for players to make it their own - rename towns, build roads, bridges, and watchtowers. Or destroy them! Explore a huge world that features multiple different terrain types, such as grasslands, scrublands, mountains, and deserts.</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""bbc_list"">
<li>
<strong>Educational Value</strong><br/>While Might &amp; Fealty is not a medieval simulation, the politics and diffuse relations between acting parties come much closer to real history than most other games. Teachers and even professors have shown an interest in the predecessor (BattleMaster), and Might &amp; Fealty will be even deeper as a tool to understand diplomacy and politics in a setting where real ambitions and proper constraints force even the kings hand.</li>
</ul>
<ul class=""bbc_list"">
<li>
<strong>Multi-Lingual</strong><br/>The game is designed from the ground up to be both playable in several languages and also allow interaction between players who don't speak the same language. I don't consider language barriers to be barriers at all, but something to be integrated into the gameplay. Recruit an NPC translator and you can send automatically translated messages to other players.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><span class=""bbc_size"" style=""font-size: 1.35em;""><strong>Gameplay</strong></span><br/>The game is turn-based with every turn representing one day in the game world and every real-life day having 4 turns/days of game time. The actions you can take fall into three broad categories, each with dozens of possible actions within them.</p>
<p>Some actions are simply resolved immediately, such as sending messages or disbanding troops. Some actions are started immediately, but take time to complete, such as the construction of buildings or the recruitment of new troops. And finally, some actions are queued and resolved at the turn, mostly those that potentially conflict with other players, such as battles or plundering your enemies villages.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9638874/maf/construction.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>Turn-based gameplay was picked intentionally to remove the need for being ""always on"" to react to enemy actions. In addition, the game is getting a sophisticated reaction system where you can specify how to react to events without the need of clicking the button yourself. For example, you can define a list of enemies that your troops will attack if they move into attack range. This way, the enemy can not sneak past you while you are asleep in real life.<br/><br/>A deep event system informs you about events that happened to your characters as well as within settlements under your control or realms you are a member of. You will also be able to get important events sent to you outside the game (via email currently, other notification systems may be added in the future).</p>

<p> </p>
<p><span class=""bbc_size"" style=""font-size: 1.35em;""><strong>Who am I ?</strong></span><br/>I'm a computer security expert with an internationally renowned reputation. Creating games has been a passion of mine for most of my life, and I've created several board, roleplaying and computer games. Most importantly, I created a browser game that is the spiritual predecessor of <em>Might &amp; Fealty,</em> and I've been successfully running it for over 12 years now.

<p>I have over 15 years of experience with free-form gameplay like this, and <em>Might &amp; Fealty</em> is the dream project I've wanted to create for the last two decades. Now, both the technology and my personal development have met at a point where it can finally be made. <em>Might &amp; Fealty</em> will be a commercial game because a proper budget allows me to pay for the graphics artists, user-interface designers and additional coders that are needed to make a game of this scale a reality.<br/>Crowdfunding is the solution to the investor problem - I have a clear vision for this project and I don't want it to be compromised for corporate marketing or portfolio reasons.<br/><br/><br/><span class=""bbc_size"" style=""font-size: 1.35em;""><strong>Current Status</strong></span></p>

<p></p>
<p>An alpha prototype version of <em>Might &amp; Fealty </em>has already been through two early testing phases, with over a hundred volunteers forming realms, waging wars and marching armies across a small test map with just 600 villages and towns. I've been working on this game for more than half a year already, and it is getting close to beta status.</p>
<p><br/>That is why the campaign has a flexible target. I'm so passionate about this game that it <strong>will</strong> happen even if I have to fund it myself over the course of years. But this is my dream project and I want you to be able to play it this year. That's right! Given successful funding here, I have plans in place to launch in (late) 2013.</p>
<p>The current development focuses on gameplay, not graphics. The initial game client will be browser-based for two reasons. Firstly, this allows for the most rapid development; and secondly, it's a good stepping stone towards a full 3D standalone client as the current game client can later be turned into the server backend for the standalone client.</p>
<p>I've assembled a small team of supporters who help with everything from forum moderation to video editing, and I have two graphics artists who are already looking forward to working on the game.<br/><br/><br/><br/><span class=""bbc_size"" style=""font-size: 1.35em;""><strong>Funding and Budget Plans</strong></span><br/>My first goal is for 40 000 €, which is the money I need to continue development at full-time speed as well as for graphics and user interface design, some software licenses and a bit of marketing.</p>
<p>This is the seed money for the project. A game of this size and complexity is not complete in a few months. I plan to keep adding features and improving gameplay after launch for years to come. My other project BattleMaster proves this <a href=""http://buildingbrowsergames.com/2009/01/29/battlemaster-post-mortem/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">development model</a>.</p>

<br/><p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Create HistoryWelcome to one of the most ambitious massively multiplayer online games currently under independent development. A game of total freedom - and its consequences. Set in a low-fantasy medieval world (similar to Game of Thrones), Might & Fealty offers you tense battles, the building of great cities, and political intrigue and betrayal that will decide the fate of nations. Equal parts strategy, roleplaying, and sandbox, this game has a world that will be shaped by its players and their choices, and a history that will be created by them as they play.

Updates:
We are currently running a closed alpha test for all funders. If you become a funder, you will get an invite key to join the alpha. See the updates tab or the forum (link at the bottom of the page) for details.
Budget details have been added below.
Gameplay and Setting: Freedom and ConsequencesIn Might & Fealty, players take the role of one or more nobles, all of whom are active in one persistent sandbox world similar to that of our own Middle Ages. You will march, form armies, conquer villages, build them into towns or cities; swear fealty to and fight alongside a large number of other players and possibly even create kingdoms. The point where other games end is the point where Might & Fealty really begins:This game is all about empowering you to play as you want to play, and allowing you to make infinite choices. But every choice comes with consquences. Choosing to be a hero to some, might make you a villain to others. Natural resources are inherently limited, so choosing to expand your villages will mean someone else gets less. Choose to be a loyal friend or choose the path of betrayal. Choose to spread your holdings by sword, - or by trade and diplomacy. Choose to be a loving spouse or an unfaithful lover. Infinite choices, but always with consequences.Play as a landless knight who wanders the world, a small-time lord, or the monarch of a huge kingdom. Get married, have children, and see your family stretch through generations. Choose any path you want, and it all depends on your skills and nothing else. Might & Fealty will never block your ambitions - but other players might! Interaction with other players is the core of the gameplay, and they all have their own ambitions and choices to make. Best of all, every player will create their own unique story as they play and that will be recorded in the game world. There will be a living, evolving, history that is made by the players as they play.

Highlights


EconomyManage villages, towns, and cities with options to construct more than 30 unique building types, including weaponsmiths, archery schools, mines, alchemists, town halls, temples, and more! Trade and build within an economic system designed to balance itself so you don't need to constantly micro-manage everything. Defend your towns by constructing walls, towers, and castles. Will you be happy with wooden palisades or will your goal be the mighty stone castle?



Evolving HistoryEverything that happens shapes the game world, and it's all recorded on an in-game history.  Your actions in the game become part of the history of the world, and that history is never lost. Sophisticated options allow research into the past of characters, cities, or Empires.



MilitaryFrom recruitment to funeral, your army is more than a collection of statistics, and it will travel the world with you. The game models individual soldiers, down to them having names and a home to return to when their tour of duty is over. Want to know how Hans fared in the last battle? This game will tell you. Total freedom to customize every soldier with a combination of different types of weapons and armour, including swords; axes; spears; shields; javelins; bows; leather, scale, or plate armour; and the feared warhorses. Recruit NPC specialists to your warband, such as scouts, spies, prospectors, heralds, merchants, and more - each with unique abilities.



PoliticsAn entirely free-form hierarchy system unlike anything you've ever seen before: built around oaths of fealty entered into by nobles of different players - or even between those nobles you yourself control. Build your relationships with other players in any way you want: You will need others to fight beside you - or to fight for! Have your holdings form a county, a duchy, a barony, a kingdom or an empire with hundreds of other players as your vassals. Plot, scheme, fight, or marry your way to power! Your social skills will be as important as your gaming skills if you want other players to support your ambitions.



Sophisticated MapsMight & Fealty uses one of the most powerful mapping systems you've ever seen in a game. It uses real geography and there is huge scope for players to make it their own - rename towns, build roads, bridges, and watchtowers. Or destroy them! Explore a huge world that features multiple different terrain types, such as grasslands, scrublands, mountains, and deserts.



Educational ValueWhile Might & Fealty is not a medieval simulation, the politics and diffuse relations between acting parties come much closer to real history than most other games. Teachers and even professors have shown an interest in the predecessor (BattleMaster), and Might & Fealty will be even deeper as a tool to understand diplomacy and politics in a setting where real ambitions and proper constraints force even the kings hand.



Multi-LingualThe game is designed from the ground up to be both playable in several languages and also allow interaction between players who don't speak the same language. I don't consider language barriers to be barriers at all, but something to be integrated into the gameplay. Recruit an NPC translator and you can send automatically translated messages to other players.

 
GameplayThe game is turn-based with every turn representing one day in the game world and every real-life day having 4 turns/days of game time. The actions you can take fall into three broad categories, each with dozens of possible actions within them.
Some actions are simply resolved immediately, such as sending messages or disbanding troops. Some actions are started immediately, but take time to complete, such as the construction of buildings or the recruitment of new troops. And finally, some actions are queued and resolved at the turn, mostly those that potentially conflict with other players, such as battles or plundering your enemies villages.
Turn-based gameplay was picked intentionally to remove the need for being ""always on"" to react to enemy actions. In addition, the game is getting a sophisticated reaction system where you can specify how to react to events without the need of clicking the button yourself. For example, you can define a list of enemies that your troops will attack if they move into attack range. This way, the enemy can not sneak past you while you are asleep in real life.A deep event system informs you about events that happened to your characters as well as within settlements under your control or realms you are a member of. You will also be able to get important events sent to you outside the game (via email currently, other notification systems may be added in the future).

 
Who am I ?I'm a computer security expert with an internationally renowned reputation. Creating games has been a passion of mine for most of my life, and I've created several board, roleplaying and computer games. Most importantly, I created a browser game that is the spiritual predecessor of Might & Fealty, and I've been successfully running it for over 12 years now. It's called BattleMaster, and it's been enjoyed by thousands of players all over the world.
I have over 15 years of experience with free-form gameplay like this, and Might & Fealty is the dream project I've wanted to create for the last two decades. Now, both the technology and my personal development have met at a point where it can finally be made. Might & Fealty will be a commercial game because a proper budget allows me to pay for the graphics artists, user-interface designers and additional coders that are needed to make a game of this scale a reality.Crowdfunding is the solution to the investor problem - I have a clear vision for this project and I don't want it to be compromised for corporate marketing or portfolio reasons.Current Status

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Mendenbarr! Those of you who recognize my name will know me from the theorycrafting work I do for death knights for World of Warcraft. </p>
<p>I've always loved games of any type, and WoW has been a huge part of my life for the past 8 years. Blizzcon is the WoW convention, and I've always wanted to attend, but I've never had the means to. So, this year I'd like to go to Blizzcon! </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need about ~$1000 to pay for my coach class airfare, my ticket, and a few snacks along the way, and pay for a portion of a hotel room. I remain hopeful I'll be able to find someone to share a hotel room with.</p>
<p>If you have a hotel room/place that has room on the floor for me and my sleeping bag and isn't that far from the convention center, I'm very interested in purchasing it. </p>
<p>If you have a spare blizzcon ticket, I'm also very interested in purchasing it. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>To be 100% clear, the successfulness of this will have no impact on my theorycrafting whatsoever. While I'll be a little sad if it fails, I'll continue devoting the same time and effort into producing useful information for all of you. I was thinking about several ideas for perks for contributors:</p>
<p>Access to all my theorycrafting work: It's already freely available on my blog, and will stay that way as long as I keep doing it. </p>
<p>1 on 1 help with your death knight: I already give this out freely to any who ask. </p>
<p>Answering any dk related questions: Already do this on both MMOC and EJ for free. </p>
<p>So I've settled on a personal thank you to anyone who contributes, and the other benefits listed below. I'm also an indie game dev, and will be giving out free beta access to my games to contributors. If anyone has any suggestions for other perks I can often, I'm all ears. </p>
<p>I've also set this campaign on fixed funding, so in the likely event I do not reach my goal, everyone will have all their money returned. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Any amount over the goal will be saved for blizzcon next year. </p></span></span></span></div>","Short Summary

<p><em>Ἡ Ῥαψωδή (The Rhapsode)</em> is a single-player puzzle-based adventure RPG set in a ""columnpunk"" version of ancient Greece. Rhapsodes were employed by the Greeks to sing and recite the epics, primarily Homer's <em>Iliad</em> and <em>Odyssey</em>. Eupheme (Ἐύφημη), our hero, learns of a lost story from the <em>Odyssey </em>and, hoping to make a name for herself and expand the repertoire of rhapsodes everywhere, sets out in search of it - a search that leads her across Greece and deep into ruins ancient even to her.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Noëlle Anthony and Mischievess Studios</h3>
<p>Noëlle Anthony, the creator of <em>Ἡ Ῥαψωδή</em>, has a long background both with games and with the classics. She programmed her first games from a Marvel Comics BASIC magazine at age 5, and has never stopped developing. Likewise, she began learning Latin in the 7th grade and earned a Bachelor's degree in Classical Studies in 2007 after more than a decade of immersion in the language and culture of ancient Greece and Rome.</p>
<p>Noëlle came out as a transgender woman in 2011, and has since founded Mischievess Studios, a game-development studio intended to give women a start in the game industry. It seemed like an obvious step to combine her loves - classical studies and game design and programming - into <em>Ἡ Ῥαψωδή, </em>the first game to be developed under the Mischievess banner.</p>
<p>Funding the development of this game will allow Mischievess Studios to pursue projects beyond <em>Ἡ Ῥαψωδή</em>, which in turn will allow Mischievess to begin and promote the careers of other women in game development and design. It's a small but significant step in equalizing the game industry.</p>
<p>Currently, Noëlle is the sole creative contributor to the project, but meeting stretch goals will change that!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Where will my contribution go?</h3>
<p>The first $36,000 of this campaign will go toward allowing Noëlle to make this game her full-time job for one year; $9,000 will go toward making necessary infrastructure changes to the studio. (Specifically, this will allow the studio access to broadband internet - a necessity which, due to the studio's location in rural Maryland, is not yet available.)</p>
<p><strong>If the primary goal is met</strong>, further contributions will be directed toward providing professional art and music for the game. Although Noëlle enjoys creating art and music, taking these off her plate will free her up to concentrate on story and programming.</p>
<p>Any contributions above $50,000 will be split evenly between art and music for <em>Ἡ Ῥαψωδή.</em> At $120,000, Mischievess Studios will attempt to retain art and music directors for the full year.</p>
<p><strong>In addition,</strong> if this project reaches $100,000 in contributions, Mischievess Studios will add an ancient Greek language option to the game.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What does my contribution get me?</h3>
<p><strong>Everyone who contributes $10 or more</strong> will receive a copy of the game when it is released, as well as free updates for the life of the game. You will also be listed as a contributor in the game's credits.</p>
<p>Larger contributions carry larger rewards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Multiple copies of the game (for friends!)</li>
<li>Alpha/beta access</li>
<li>Exclusive wallpapers and icons</li>
<li>The official <em>Ἡ Ῥαψωδή </em>soundtrack</li>
<li>Higher-status credit within the game</li>
<li>Access to exclusive in-game items</li>
<li>The ability to name an in-game NPC (within reason)</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<h3>What if I can't contribute financially?</h3>
<p>You can still help by spreading the word! <strong>Every single share, tweet, Facebook post, Tumbl, and blog post helps. </strong>And if you're a musician or artist who would be willing to contribute to <em>Ἡ Ῥαψωδή</em><em>, </em>please drop us a line and let us know!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How do you pronounce <em>Ἡ Ῥαψωδή</em>?</h3>
<p>Roughly: ""hey rhah-psoh-DAY"". (But nobody will be upset if you just call the game ""The Rhapsode"".)</p>
<h3>How can I get in touch?</h3>
<p>You can find Noëlle on Twitter as @noellejoyeuse, or send an email to noelle.d.anthony at Gmail. Noëlle will also be starting a podcast discussing the development process - watch this space for details!</p></div>","The Rhapsode

Noëlle Anthony and Mischievess Studios
Noëlle Anthony, the creator of Ἡ Ῥαψωδή, has a long background both with games and with the classics. She programmed her first games from a Marvel Comics BASIC magazine at age 5, and has never stopped developing. Likewise, she began learning Latin in the 7th grade and earned a Bachelor's degree in Classical Studies in 2007 after more than a decade of immersion in the language and culture of ancient Greece and Rome.
Noëlle came out as a transgender woman in 2011, and has since founded Mischievess Studios, a game-development studio intended to give women a start in the game industry. It seemed like an obvious step to combine her loves - classical studies and game design and programming - into Ἡ Ῥαψωδή, the first game to be developed under the Mischievess banner.
Funding the development of this game will allow Mischievess Studios to pursue projects beyond Ἡ Ῥαψωδή, which in turn will allow Mischievess to begin and promote the careers of other women in game development and design. It's a small but significant step in equalizing the game industry.
Currently, Noëlle is the sole creative contributor to the project, but meeting stretch goals will change that!
 
Where will my contribution go?
The first $36,000 of this campaign will go toward allowing Noëlle to make this game her full-time job for one year; $9,000 will go toward making necessary infrastructure changes to the studio. (Specifically, this will allow the studio access to broadband internet - a necessity which, due to the studio's location in rural Maryland, is not yet available.)
If the primary goal is met, further contributions will be directed toward providing professional art and music for the game. Although Noëlle enjoys creating art and music, taking these off her plate will free her up to concentrate on story and programming.
Any contributions above $50,000 will be split evenly between art and music for Ἡ Ῥαψωδή. At $120,000, Mischievess Studios will attempt to retain art and music directors for the full year.
In addition, if this project reaches $100,000 in contributions, Mischievess Studios will add an ancient Greek language option to the game.
 
What does my contribution get me?
Everyone who contributes $10 or more will receive a copy of the game when it is released, as well as free updates for the life of the game. You will also be listed as a contributor in the game's credits.
Larger contributions carry larger rewards:

Multiple copies of the game (for friends!)
Alpha/beta access
Exclusive wallpapers and icons
The official Ἡ Ῥαψωδή soundtrack
Higher-status credit within the game
Access to exclusive in-game items
The ability to name an in-game NPC (within reason)
 
What if I can't contribute financially?
You can still help by spreading the word! Every single share, tweet, Facebook post, Tumbl, and blog post helps. And if you're a musician or artist who would be willing to contribute to Ἡ Ῥαψωδή, please drop us a line and let us know!
 
How do you pronounce Ἡ Ῥαψωδή?
Roughly: ""hey rhah-psoh-DAY"". (But nobody will be upset if you just call the game ""The Rhapsode"".)
How can I get in touch?
You can find Noëlle on Twitter as @noellejoyeuse, or send an email to noelle.d.anthony at Gmail. Noëlle will also be starting a podcast discussing the development process - watch this space for details!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.YourGamerCards.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.YourGamerCards.net</a> is popular and growing.  With the addition of v3 we are gaining more and more users.  We also can now bring you even more features including many things you have asked for.  There is only one problem, our servers.  We are already spending a ton of money each month to rent servers.  Unfortunately it costs too much to upgrade what we are renting so we are going to buy servers that will suit our needs.  This campaign is to help offset the high upfront costs and make sure YGC can continue to grow and server the Playstation community.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The funds raised from this campaign will go to funding the purchase of new servers and covering any additional costs like software licensing, taxes, bandwidth, advertising, and anything else we run into.</p>
<p>Currently our database server if in dire need of more RAM.  To rent any more would be a waste of money.  Instead most of the funds is going to a new database server with tons of RAM.  We also need better, faster hard drives to make the cards update more frequently (we already update the fastest but we want them to go even faster), and to handle more users efficiently.  More RAM and better hard drives will also help us to bring out new friend comparison features we have developed.  We also would need a new webserver at this point so that we aren't renting one server and renting space for the other server somewhere else.  In the end this will also make our monthly upkeep cost lower dramatically.  This will help us keep our site free for everyone.  I took over the site with the goal of never requiring a subscription and I intend to keep it that way.</p>
<p>Other than the hardware costs we also have software costs.  When converting to v3 we wanted to be legit so we made sure our IPB and other site licensing was up to date.  Things like chat, forums, guides and other parts of the site were developed by others and require licensing fees.  </p>
<p>Lastly we have rent and bandwidth expenses.  With the hardware update we plan to be self sustaining but we will fall short from month to month.  Any remaining funds will be put toward these costs.</p>
<p>I took over this site and community not to make money but to keep it running indefinitely.  I make no money here and this is not a business to me.  For me YGC is for all lovers of Playstation gaming.  All staff volunteer our time and talents to better the community for all.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Rewards</h3>
<p>Some of you really just want to help out.  Others need incentives.  Personally I like rewards too.  We've tried to come up with rewards that make sense with the donation levels.  Please ask any questions or voice concerns.  Otherwise pick a level you want and help support the cause.  If you wish to donate and give the reward as a gift to another user of the site we can do that as well.  We will send out surveys to handle all rewards at the end of this campaign.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Thank you for your support and let's make YGC even better!</h3>

What We Need
The funds raised from this campaign will go to funding the purchase of new servers and covering any additional costs like software licensing, taxes, bandwidth, advertising, and anything else we run into.
Currently our database server if in dire need of more RAM.  To rent any more would be a waste of money.  Instead most of the funds is going to a new database server with tons of RAM.  We also need better, faster hard drives to make the cards update more frequently (we already update the fastest but we want them to go even faster), and to handle more users efficiently.  More RAM and better hard drives will also help us to bring out new friend comparison features we have developed.  We also would need a new webserver at this point so that we aren't renting one server and renting space for the other server somewhere else.  In the end this will also make our monthly upkeep cost lower dramatically.  This will help us keep our site free for everyone.  I took over the site with the goal of never requiring a subscription and I intend to keep it that way.
Other than the hardware costs we also have software costs.  When converting to v3 we wanted to be legit so we made sure our IPB and other site licensing was up to date.  Things like chat, forums, guides and other parts of the site were developed by others and require licensing fees.  
Lastly we have rent and bandwidth expenses.  With the hardware update we plan to be self sustaining but we will fall short from month to month.  Any remaining funds will be put toward these costs.
I took over this site and community not to make money but to keep it running indefinitely.  I make no money here and this is not a business to me.  For me YGC is for all lovers of Playstation gaming.  All staff volunteer our time and talents to better the community for all.


The Rewards
Some of you really just want to help out.  Others need incentives.  Personally I like rewards too.  We've tried to come up with rewards that make sense with the donation levels.  Please ask any questions or voice concerns.  Otherwise pick a level you want and help support the cause.  If you wish to donate and give the reward as a gift to another user of the site we can do that as well.  We will send out surveys to handle all rewards at the end of this campaign.


Thank you for your support and let's make YGC even better!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Through my online fitness initiative I have discovered that younger kids don't know a lot about healthy lifestyle choices! They learn more bad habits from bad role models than they do in health class! I want to create a mobile game that kids can play that will also teach them about a healthy lifestyle!

If we reach only partial finance goal ?The acquired resources will go on equipment according to the collected amount. We will provide full disclosure on how we spend the acquired resources.
What if we don't reach even minimal amount ?Of course, we will continue development same as before: very slowly and with great difficulties, according to our limited options.
What if I have question which wasn't explained !We will gladly answer any question about our project and campaign here on Indiegogo. U can contact us at indiegogoinfo@jwkk.biz .
Can I help even if I can't make contribution ?Yes. U can use the share option (referral up and down) of our campaign, so as many people as possible will find out about our project.",16.0,1,"2 Campaigns

<p>Years after the last fight for ""Ria Masa"", the former human capitol which was completely destroyed during the battle, Orcs and Humans alike gained strength and will to rule the world of  ""Asir'el"" alone once and for all again. What started with a few incidents has become another big war which won't end until the sea turns red. </p>

<h3>F.A.Q.</h3>
<div>The last days I received some questions and concerns, so let me try to clear some things up:</div>
</div><div>Q: ""Your lack of experience is concerning""</div><div>A: I've been working as a Programmer for a big Company (AVL Group) for several years. I've been developing with Unity for over 3 years now, and have used several other engines before. I've graduated from the higher technical school of Kaindorf, and started programming when I was 11 years old. All in all, I don't see that I lack any experience.</div><div><br/></div><div>Q: ""The budget is too low. I assume that means you will be working on it solo for half a year to a year?""</div><div>A: Exactly. But, the budget is only meant to finance the final part of the development. Most assets, and all the previous development is on me.</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>

5000 $ - What can I say, that's amazing! If you happen to be a developer, I'd love to give you the complete source code and all the asset's that I made myself! Of course only after I released the game.

F.A.Q.
The last days I received some questions and concerns, so let me try to clear some things up:
Q: ""Your lack of experience is concerning""A: I've been working as a Programmer for a big Company (AVL Group) for several years. I've been developing with Unity for over 3 years now, and have used several other engines before. I've graduated from the higher technical school of Kaindorf, and started programming when I was 11 years old. All in all, I don't see that I lack any experience.Q: ""The budget is too low. I assume that means you will be working on it solo for half a year to a year?""A: Exactly. But, the budget is only meant to finance the final part of the development. Most assets, and all the previous development is on me.
About the Developer

I am Alexander Stacher, a 23 year old student from Graz, Austria. Besides attending University I have been working as a programmer for the AVL Group for the last years. 
Ever since I have been a kid I've been developing games. It all started with RPG Maker (good times), and brought me here. 
After working with Unity for severall years, and almost a year of developing Pocket Crusades, I'm willing to take it one step further, and fully focus on game development.",14.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is CPL Damon Williams.  I am an active duty soldier in the Guard and I serve the people of the United States.  Whether it be natural or man-made disasters, lost or injured children, or just helping you launch your kite at the Kite Festival, I am there for you.   I respond in your time of need. </p>
<p>When not deployed or training, I am an electrical engineer that designs electronics for sporting and medical equipment.  I've developed and brought to market hundreds of products in my lifetime and will continue to better the world with the products I create.</p>
<p>During my time in the Guard, I have constantly been frustrated by my inability to know exactly where my soldiers are.  Whether in a training scenario or actually deployed to a disaster, I only know where a soldiers is if he/she can tell me where they are over the radio (and they get lost a lot...).  And with the recent death of a soldier during land navigation training, I decided to create a system that would never allow a soldier to become lost again.  Not only would we always know where they are, but if they get into trouble, help would be only a push of a button away.  And when help is needed, their exact GPS location can be sent to a Med-Evac to allow faster than normal response. </p>
<p>The system is already created and implimented.  It works perfectly.  I'm already selling to Paintball teams and outdoorsmen.  Now I need your help to get it into the hands of those that need it the most FOR FREE.  That's right, 100% of this funding will go toward supplying as many firefighters, search and rescue, soldiers, disaster responders or any other Local, State, or Federal support agency with these systems.    And not at retail price, not as wholesale price, but at actual cost.  They will be supplied with as many tracking nodes, base stations, software, and phone apps as they need.  ALL FOR FREE!!  If you or someone you know has ever been in need, please consider contributing...  Please help us protect and ensure the safety of our men and women in the field when they need us the most.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As stated earlier, these are on the market and in the field.  Unfortunately state and federal budgets have been reduced and reduced over the years and many of these organizations simply don't have the funds to allocate the purchase of these.  So I decided to create this project to ask for help in supplying these tracking system FREE of charge to all that need them...</p>
<p>Every $100 donated to the Track Our Heroes Project will supply ONE tracking node for a responder/soldier/fireman.  I will supply all base station hardware and software out of my own pocket.  If we reach our goal, that's 400 men and women that will have their locations know while in the field and I will supply 40 base station hardware and software packages.  (10 tracking nodes and one base station and software).  And realize these tracking nodes cost $100 to manufacture.  So every dime you donate goes toward supplying nodes.  None of that ""admin cost"" garbage!!</p>
<p>As for you generous people, other than knowing you are helping the men and women that help those in need, you can receive either a Cert of Appreciation, Gratitude Plaque, or Bronze Resin Gratitude Plaque.  We already have an agreement from plaque marker to donate as many plaques as we need.  So no money for plaques will come out of donated funds..  As well as weekly updates to whom has received the nodes and pictures of them being used in the field.  Imagine if another Katrina hits and every one of our responders can be accounted for at any time.  And if they find someone in need, thier exact location is known.  Even if the power is out and the cell towers are down, we'll still know where they are.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, that's OK.  We will still supply as many tracking nodes as we can with whatever we get.  Even if I only get a couple hundred bucks, that's a couple responders we can help protect...  and if I exceed my goal, then I will supply as many systems to as many local, state and federal agencies that need them until the money is gone. </p>

<h3>The System:</h3>
<div class=""WordSection1"">
<p>The POINTS (Personal Outdoor Intelligent-Networked Tracking System) node is a personal, non-cellular, GPS tracking transceiver that will transmit your location, Emergency status, or give an audible indication to you from Base.  The POINTS node has been designed for outdoor activities ranging from civilian sports events, search and rescue, wide area damage assessment, and even training/deployment of military personnel.  With up-to-the-minute location reporting you will always know where your people are.</p>
<p>The POINTS node is the smallest, lightest real-time tracking node avail on the market.  And by using self-healing, sleep supported mesh networking; each node can also act as repeater gaining maximum range at minimal power consumption.  And without the need for external support systems, like cellular or satellite, there are NO MONTHLY FEEs and will work anywhere on the planet that GPS is avail.</p>
<p>POINTS nodes also have integrated Bluetooth to allow communication with Android smart phones running our POINTS Radar app.  This app allows for individuals in the field to “see” where other nodes are located as quickly as they update.  This can be instrumental in quickly finding lost/injured searches, coordinating team play, or conformation of movements.</p>

<p align=""center""><strong>POINTS Node Features</strong></p>
</div>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<div class=""WordSection4"">
<p><strong>No fees – EVER</strong></p>
<p>Since our system uses public frequencies, there are no fees (and no license required).  Plus even if you are in a location with no power, no service, or even no inhabitants, you will be able to locate and track all your nodes</p>
<p><strong>Lightest GPS Node on the market</strong></p>
<p>At 3.0oz, the POINTS node is, hands down, the lightest node avail.  And by using standard AAA batteries, you will never have to worry about not being able to find replacement batteries.</p>
<p><strong>Smallest non-cellular Node</strong></p>
<p>The POINTS Node was designed to also be small.  It easily fits in a shirt packet or the shoulder pocket of an Army ACU.  Plus with its industrial Velcro, it can be attached to any surface, including helmets and vehicles</p>
<p><strong>Simple to use</strong></p>
<p>For the most part, the POINTS Node is plug and play.  No setup is needed.  Just insert the batteries and place in your pocket.  The Base Station software will take care of the rest.</p>
<p><strong>Long Range</strong></p>
<p>Because we use a self-healing, sleeping mesh network, each of our nodes can act as a repeater.  This allows for a node's location to “hop” from one node to another until it reaches the base station.  Greater battery life and higher reliability means safety for the user.</p>
<p><strong>Online or Offline</strong></p>
<p>Our Base Station software supports both online system (using Google Maps) and offline system (using a pre-downloaded satellite image or a Crayon drawing for you SEALs).</p>
<p><strong>Military Grid support</strong></p>
<p>Once calibrated (about 30 seconds) the Base Station software can give you the exact military grid coordinate of any node on the map (fixed location online or pre-downloaded maps only).</p>
<p><strong>Battery Life</strong></p>
<p>Holy Cow!!  You never thought 2 standard AAA batteries could last so long.  But with low power transceivers, a sleeping mesh network, and ultra-low power electronics, you can go WEEKS without having to change batteries.</p>
<p><strong>Multiple Networks</strong></p>
<p>With up to 8 networks supported, you can have multiple teams operating in the same location and each have its own independent Network.  Great for Sports activities (paintball) where you don’t want the other team to know where you are</p>
<p><strong>Emergency/Indicator</strong></p>
<p>Each node is equipped with an Emergency button that reports the node's location back to the base station and all Bluetooth active nodes.  And each node is equipped with an auditory beeper that can be activated by the base station to signal the node.  There is also an option to activate the beepers on ALL Nodes on a network at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Development Kits Avail</strong></p>
<p>For all of you that enjoy writing your own code, we support Developers with both our open source Base Station Software and our Open source hardware.  Although our hardware is protected by Copyright/Patent laws.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth (POINTS Radar)</strong></p>
<p>With our Smartphone app, each node wearer has the ability to know where all other nodes are located at a glance.</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div class=""WordSection5"">
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p align=""center""><strong>Applications</strong></p>
<p><strong>Outdoor  Sports:    </strong>Paintball, Airsoft and other outdoor sports activities have numerous players in the field.  This system would allow you know exactly where you buddies are.  Even Equip referees with nodes on a separate network to identify if any refs are grouping together…  Plus hunters are able to know exactly where their hunting buddies are; preventing accidents.</p>
<p><strong>Search and rescue:</strong> While searching for lost or injured individuals, a command post must know where all of their searchers are.  And with the Emergency button on each node, if a searcher gets lost or hurt, they can call for help at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Military/Police:      </strong>Training can be dangerous.  Especially during land navigation or wide area training.   Make sure you know exactly where your soldiers are to keep them safe and track their path to see how they can improve.</p>

<h3>Why We Are Fundraising</h3>
<p>This game will cost $247,000 to develop for PC and Mac. Some of this money will come from this campaign, some will come from grants, most of it however, will come from our own pockets. This campaign is not a means to pay for the entire game.</p>
<p>The budget for this game is roughly 1/4 the budget of a similar quality game. There are three reasons for this:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>The game will be developed using the Unity engine. This game engine is low cost and has many prefabbed scripts, which drastically lowers programming costs.</li>
<li>Most of the concept, writing and game design work was done for free by the game's creators.</li>
<li>The people working on the game have multiple talents. Your average game studio would have each person assigned to a specific task. Each member of our team is responsible for multiple different types of tasks. Less salaries means a cheaper game.</li>
</ol>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Game Details</h3>Bowhead will be developed for Microsoft Windows  and Apple OSX using the Unity engine. This powerful game engine allows for multiple styles of gameplay. In Bowhead you will regularly switch between first and third person view depending on your environment. Unity also allows for extensive graphics card options, which allows you to make the game look as good as possible on your computer.<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Mobile Plans</h3>
<div>We plan to port Bowhead to Android and iOS if we can raise $350,000</div>

We are Humanoid Interactive, an independent development studio based in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. 
Our small company consists of artists, animators and programmers. We work well together as a team and we hope to make a game that is not only fun to play, but also teaches people about Canadian and Aboriginal culture.
The Thule culture (pronounced Too-Lee) were the ancestors of all modern Inuit. They developed in coastal Alaska by AD 1000 and expanded eastwards across Canada, reaching Greenland by the 13th century. 
These people lived in incredibly harsh arctic conditions hunting Bowhead whales for survival. They used whale oil for burning, they made clothing from animal skins, they even built their houses out of whale bones using tools also made from whale bones. 
We decided to make this game not only to teach people about Aboriginal heritage but to incorporate Canadian culture as well. This game is about a seal hunter from Newfoundland in 1908 who finds himself lost in the North Atlantic after disaster strikes his sealing vessel. The first part of the game centers around rural Newfoundland life in the early 20th century.
People who contribute to the creation of this game are helping to spread Canadian culture to the whole world.

Enemies you defeat, loot you pick up, dialogue choices, and much more are fed into the artificial intelligence powering the Wheel of Fate.  The wheel then sifts through all those choices and upon spinning, delivers decisions about what should happen next. When we say your choices matter in Wheel of Fate, we mean your choices decide: side quests, branches in the main quest, the dungeon theme, elemental effects, enemies, loot, and more. Will friends or foes appear at your gates? Only the Wheel of Fate knows.</p><h3> </h3><h3>Ring 1 - Force</h3><p>The force ring sets the prevailing ""theme"" that is in effect within the world it has 5 segments:</p><p><strong>Knowledge</strong> - Knowledge will lead you down a path where using lore, your wits, and your skills to prove your mental acuity can overcome anything!</p><p><strong>Conflict</strong> - Conflict will lead you down a path of aggressiveness, fighting, and using your might to crush the bones of your enemies beneath your feet!</p><p><strong>Fortune</strong> - Fortune will lead you down a path of subtlety, opportunity, and using your shrewd nature to always come out ahead!</p><p><strong>Industry</strong> - Industry will lead you down a path of productivity, efficiency, and using your resources to build your empire as a shining beacon of progressiveness!</p><p><strong>Adventure</strong> - Adventure will lead you down a path of well.. a little bit of everything! You go where the winds take you and no one can deny your wanderlust!</p><h3> </h3><h3>Ring 2 - Rank and Quality</h3><p>This ring tells you what to expect in terms of loot, shops inventory, difficulty of enemies in the dungeon, scale of quests.  If you see Rank 5, be prepared! What you face will be difficult and expensive. With great risk, comes great reward!</p><h3> </h3><h3>Ring 3 - Zodiac (Element)</h3><p>This ring is the ""spice"" ring.  It changes the ambiance, lighting, available lore, elemental buffs and debuffs, and types of enemies.  As a player, when you choose a zodiac at the beginning of the game, you are choosing to align with a specific element.  On days where your element matches the zodiac, you are buffed! On days where your element is opposite to the element of the wheel spin, you are debuffed.  Let's just say... ""Avatar of Fate"" isn't used lightly!</p><p>With each Chapter of Wheel of Fate we release the A.I will be smarter!  We will work with our players to create intelligence where it's desired. We have started exploring incredible features like fortune telling, intelligent chat bots for NPC's, Game wide A.I decisions based on player choices, etc.  The possibilities are very exciting and we can't wait to explore them with you!</p><p>Some people call it luck; others call it destiny. But on the world of Providence, Fate's presence was felt everywhere. Fate is the central force that combines Creation, Destruction and Change, which brought the universe into existence.  That is, until The Affliction appeared. Born out of people's disbelief, the Affliction cut off living beings from Fate's influence, turning them Fateless. The Fateless were defeated in the Zodiac War, but then the world itself was removed from Fate's influence, as the Temple, the Wheel and the Avatar of Fate vanished into thin air.</p><p>One thousand years later, Fate, the Fateless and the Zodiac War are nothing but legends, mostly forgotten. Until one day, a lone adventurer reawakens the Wheel of Fate, and the legends of old are realized true.

As many kids did, they had 1 TV and 1 console to playon.  When one of them would get ahead it would spoil the story. This ruined the fun! As a result, he was fueled by a desire to create a single-player RPG where players could have their own stories. Daniel had to find a way to make a dynamic game. Fast forward many years later, and he was heavily modding a player made Neverwinter Nights world called The World of Avlis.  The experience as a player, dungeon master, level designer, writer, and coder helped to cement what would become Wheel of Fate. Daniel then went on to work heavily with random number generators and probability. This led to his “AHA!” moment while he couldn’t recreate the DM experience, he saw a way to emulate it. Combining RNG knowledge from previous work with new machine learning techniques is how Wheel of Fate was born. From that moment onward, UDX Interactive has had many fateful moments which has lead us here and fueled our desire to make rich games filled with excitement and endless fun!</p><h2><a href=""https://www.udxinteractive.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571254952/id7cqjsyllwgodfm2h62.png"" src=""""/></a></h2><p> </p><p>We are a company that crafts games we LOVE to play.

RPG's are difficult to make which is why we chose to go single player and PC only first. It allows us to focus on delivering a great game and then porting or adding multiplayer later. We have a veteran passionate team that is willing to push really hard to see Wheel of Fate completed.</p><p>We further mitigate the risk of making a big RPG with an extensive story by breaking Wheel of Fate into chapters. Releasing a chapter at a time tests a smaller segment of the game, learn what our players like and dislike, and grow from the experience. You can choose to pick up a chapter at a time, reducing your upfront cost. This allows us to build content based on each chapter's feedback. We want to make our relationship with players as mutually beneficial as possible.</p><p>Building a game that is tied to your choices, then having an A.I dynamically deliver the content and build the world based on those choices is a risk. We have mitigated this risk in 3 ways:</p><p>1) We have an incredibly experienced team including a PHD in Cybernetics who helped us develop the A.I.</p><p>2) We have contained the world to known variables it's a town and a dungeon. So the A.I doesn't have to account for infinite points of data. Fixing the size of the world helps us lower our risk. This also allows us to focus on dynamic content that delivers the most exciting parts of Wheel of Fate.</p><p>3) This was the first challenge started when envisioning the game years ago, giving us time to work through what it meant to create this innovation.</p><p>We are open and honest about issues and address them directly with the community. This has been our mantra from the very beginning of development through our social media and discord channels.</p><p>When we start testing phases we may have to change design, systems or methods in order to deliver a truly fun experience. Our goal is to make a game that we all love to play. While we can't change everything or make every person happy we will do our best to make gameplay, story, and value-added choices that benefit all of us. We will also explain those choices as clearly and openly as possible. We are gamers that love this genre and we are our very hard on ourselves. However, we need your input to make sure we are heading down the right path.</p><p>We are confident we will overcome any challenge because of the great team we have to make it happen. We will release Wheel of Fate no matter what happens. However, to truly deliver the full experience we want for our backers and ourselves, we need to expand what's available. We are looking to Crowdfunding to make it happen.</p><p>Here's what we promise to our backers:</p><p>- We will include our fans, backers, and players feedback in the development of each chapter of the game. Each chapter we put out will focus on growing Wheel of Fate to higher degrees of quality and new, different, and interesting content. Your feedback is vital to making that a reality.</p><p>- Where we are not able to release the first installment of the project on a digital marketplace we will refund our backers.</p><p> </p></div>","AboutWheel of Fate (WOF) is the first chapter of our single player RPG with turn-based combat.  Our goal is to bring back this incredible genre with a unique, modern twist.

Enemies you defeat, loot you pick up, dialogue choices, and much more are fed into the artificial intelligence powering the Wheel of Fate.  The wheel then sifts through all those choices and upon spinning, delivers decisions about what should happen next. When we say your choices matter in Wheel of Fate, we mean your choices decide: side quests, branches in the main quest, the dungeon theme, elemental effects, enemies, loot, and more. Will friends or foes appear at your gates? Only the Wheel of Fate knows. Ring 1 - ForceThe force ring sets the prevailing ""theme"" that is in effect within the world it has 5 segments:Knowledge - Knowledge will lead you down a path where using lore, your wits, and your skills to prove your mental acuity can overcome anything!Conflict - Conflict will lead you down a path of aggressiveness, fighting, and using your might to crush the bones of your enemies beneath your feet!Fortune - Fortune will lead you down a path of subtlety, opportunity, and using your shrewd nature to always come out ahead!Industry - Industry will lead you down a path of productivity, efficiency, and using your resources to build your empire as a shining beacon of progressiveness!Adventure - Adventure will lead you down a path of well.. a little bit of everything!

With great risk, comes great reward! Ring 3 - Zodiac (Element)This ring is the ""spice"" ring.  It changes the ambiance, lighting, available lore, elemental buffs and debuffs, and types of enemies.  As a player, when you choose a zodiac at the beginning of the game, you are choosing to align with a specific element.  On days where your element matches the zodiac, you are buffed! On days where your element is opposite to the element of the wheel spin, you are debuffed.  Let's just say... ""Avatar of Fate"" isn't used lightly!With each Chapter of Wheel of Fate we release the A.I will be smarter!  We will work with our players to create intelligence where it's desired. We have started exploring incredible features like fortune telling, intelligent chat bots for NPC's, Game wide A.I decisions based on player choices, etc.  The possibilities are very exciting and we can't wait to explore them with you!Some people call it luck; others call it destiny. But on the world of Providence, Fate's presence was felt everywhere. Fate is the central force that combines Creation, Destruction and Change, which brought the universe into existence.  That is, until The Affliction appeared. Born out of people's disbelief, the Affliction cut off living beings from Fate's influence, turning them Fateless. The Fateless were defeated in the Zodiac War, but then the world itself was removed from Fate's influence, as the Temple, the Wheel and the Avatar of Fate vanished into thin air.One thousand years later, Fate, the Fateless and the Zodiac War are nothing but legends, mostly forgotten. Until one day, a lone adventurer reawakens the Wheel of Fate, and the legends of old are realized true. The nearby village of Kismet's Fall becomes the center of the world, as all the races of Providence converge on this sleepy backwater town. The Fateless are poised to reclaim the world that had evaded their grasp. All that stands between them and their victory is one adventurer; the protector of Kismet's Fall and the Avatar of Fate. Click to listenAll our music is completely original and incredibly done!  We have a veteran of the music industry and a rock-legend helping us produce the best music for our game!Terry Brown is the legendary producer of Rush.  He's also worked with Jimi Hendrix, The Who, and more!

<p>The gameplay background is based around terrible consequences of Extraterrain Invasion in a form of parasitizing biological specimen hacking the Human Genome.</p>
<p>You have no guns for a good reason. Aliens almost immediately can tame your consciousness with their brain waves. The only hope for humanity, not to get enslaved, is the Resist.</p>

<p>Resist is super intelligent group of engineers, stalkers and scientists hiding in secret labs. Their strategy is creating of authonomous battle robots, insensitive to alien's waves. They ugently need to find as many Data Engineers and Data Scientists as possible to acomplish this plan.</p>
<p>And here is your role: beginning Data Scientists who needs to embark on crash course of Machine Learning using Python programming language.</p>
<p>The brain is your main weapon and strength, quadrupled by deep networks forecasting the future.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554309203/piuno4i1dowh1ltbgsnw.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>To dilute the depressing flow of the scenario, some weak points of Aliens were discovered. For example, their brain waves, usually deadly for humans, can be effectively reflected by a small dog of Pug breed. The secret is hidden in the structure of Pug’s brain which operates as a shortcut (absolute zero of Intelligence) for sophisticated brains of Aliens. So as a RPG player, your first task will be finding a Pug and keeping him happy with dog food artifacts. Also don’t miss AID artifacts, as they come handy. Stay away from Aliens Machines Lights - they are harmful.</p>

<p>In complete realization of our Game we are planning to have 3 episodes guiding you from most basic knowledge to pretty sophisticated level.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;&gt;First episode: joining Resist.</p>
<p>You approach the sector A, fully controlled by Aliens. The reason why you are here is Education Corner - a computer, installed by Resist in StarPugs cafe. This computer includes crash course of Python, REST and Data Engineering as well as statements of your 3 tasks for this level.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554309410/a9h4uhifcvv25v8bt1ju.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>You have to visit this Education Corner 3 times - each time learning some knowledge and applying earned codes to the game world.</p>

<h3> </h3>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","The gameplay background is based around terrible consequences of Extraterrain Invasion in a form of parasitizing biological specimen hacking the Human Genome.
You have no guns for a good reason. Aliens almost immediately can tame your consciousness with their brain waves. The only hope for humanity, not to get enslaved, is the Resist.

Resist is super intelligent group of engineers, stalkers and scientists hiding in secret labs. Their strategy is creating of authonomous battle robots, insensitive to alien's waves. They ugently need to find as many Data Engineers and Data Scientists as possible to acomplish this plan.
And here is your role: beginning Data Scientists who needs to embark on crash course of Machine Learning using Python programming language.
The brain is your main weapon and strength, quadrupled by deep networks forecasting the future.

To dilute the depressing flow of the scenario, some weak points of Aliens were discovered. For example, their brain waves, usually deadly for humans, can be effectively reflected by a small dog of Pug breed. The secret is hidden in the structure of Pug’s brain which operates as a shortcut (absolute zero of Intelligence) for sophisticated brains of Aliens. So as a RPG player, your first task will be finding a Pug and keeping him happy with dog food artifacts. Also don’t miss AID artifacts, as they come handy. Stay away from Aliens Machines Lights - they are harmful.
  
In complete realization of our Game we are planning to have 3 episodes guiding you from most basic knowledge to pretty sophisticated level.
>>>First episode: joining Resist.
You approach the sector A, fully controlled by Aliens. The reason why you are here is Education Corner - a computer, installed by Resist in StarPugs cafe. This computer includes crash course of Python, REST and Data Engineering as well as statements of your 3 tasks for this level.

You have to visit this Education Corner 3 times - each time learning some knowledge and applying earned codes to the game world.
Remember, at the initial level, you are defenseless against the searchlights of Aliens machines. But you can domesticate a Pug whose brain waves can hide you from Invaders.
To keep the Pug near you - you have to feed him with dog food, hidden across the sector area. . If you don`t do this, your faithful defender will run down.

You will have 3 educational lessons on this level. Each lesson has a sequence of Python commands to be performed in Google Colab - the top notch online Python editor with pre-installed Machine Learning tools. In the result of each lesson you will receive a secret code stored on your Virtual Tablet. This code should be applied to some specific object inside the gaming world - like citylight or ATM machine.

The first episode covers the following 3 topics from our Machine learning agenda:
Lesson 1. Intro to coding in the Gaming World.
Lesson 2. Quick intro to Python - the main modern language used for ML
Lesson 3. How to manipulate your Data with Pandas, visualize and analyse them with Matplotlib.

This journey was chosen with the aim of quick understanding of main concepts in modern Machine Learning.

</div></div>","My name is Andreas Propst; I am a mid-twenties artist and designer of board and card games from a rural part in Upper Austria. Initially I studied social work but had to discontinue my studies after a severe tropical illness contracted during a practical placement with an Indian development agency in 2008. A crisis can be a chance so they say, and that has become true for me. Due to my utterly changed life situation I was able to commit myself fully to what I am most passionate about: Designing tabletop games. For about 7 years now I have put tremendous thought, effort, time and also money into a game project of mine going by the name of Elemental Clash. Elemental Clash is a fantasy-themed, non-collectible yet highly customizable card game. What was the result of one long night's epiphany back in 2006 has seen ups and downs, has been tended with care, evolved tremendously and developed with passion and commitment. What you see now in the Elemental Clash card game, is the result of an odyssey. With my own, meager financial resources I gave the game, which I had illustrated myself before, a total visual makeover in 2012. After several unsuccessful Kickstarter campaigns I was able to release ""Elemental Clash: The Master Set"" on www.thegamecrafter.com featuring about 100 exciting cards with professionally done illustrations. Parallel to that, a crafty crew of software developers from Indonesia teamed up with me to take Elemental Clash to your Mobile Device in the form of an App for Android and iOS (You can download the free trial version for Android right now, but more on that later).Now in the middle of realizing the first, full, 100 cards-strong expansion set to Elemental Clash: The Master Set......sadly, the Elemental Clash project, which is my beloved ""brain-child"", has come to a halt more or less, since my life's savings are spent quite literally. I have countless cards and expansion sets all planned out and the only limiting factor is the financial aspect, specifically the art budget. And this is where I would need YOUR assistance. Please read on as I explain why this is important to me and how you could profit, at the very least in an idealistic sense. I will also showcase some of the grand artwork and the terrific reviews the game has received from renowned games reviewers.Funding a customizable card game with state-of-the-art illustrations is not easy to accomplish for a single person. Reviewers have said Elemental Clash: The Master Set can compare to popular CCGs like Magic: the Gathering and others when it comes to visuals - and to gameplay. I am proud what I achieved with the Master Set. Now the first expansion, Legendary Legacy, is in the middle of being realized and this is where you come in.The sole goal of this campaign is to get the artwork for the Legendary Legacy Expansion fundend. I have previously announced that I plan on releasing the expansion towards the end of the first quarter of 2014. I am NOT raising money for getting a larger print run funded - Elemental Clash: Legendary Legacy will be available via print-on-demand on www.thegamecrafter.com. However I would need approximately $2500 USD for the creation of the second half of the expansion set artwork. The first half of the art is already finished but alas I have run out of money and this is why I am reaching out to you, dear friend of fantasy customizable card games, to get the job done!For your information: One high-quality artwork of the likes of what you have seen so far costs me $50 UD on average. The expansion set will feature  over 100 exciting, new cards and, as mentioned before, about half of the artwork is already done and paid for. That means I would be needing another $2500 USD for the rest of the artwork.The main goal of this campaign is to raise the remaining money needed to fund the art for the Legendary Legacy expansion.The secondary or ""stretch goal"" for this campaing would be to make $5000 USD, which would mean my previous and future expenses for the expansion would be covered. In any case I can assure you that 100% of the money you kindly donate will go towards the furthering of the Elemental Clash Project as a whole, being invested in art for future sets or into the development of add-ons and updates for the Elemental Clash Mobile App for example.If you should decide to support the Elemental Clash project, your rewards shall be bountiful!I am offering some very unique rewards which will be bestowed on you for any donation starting at as little as 5 dollars and with no upper limit. Literally every dollar counts in this campaign.If you decide to support Elemental Clash with just 5 or 10 dollars, you will get nice desktop wallpapers featuring the unique and awesome artwork from Elemental Clash: Legendary Legacy or the Elemental Clash Master Set and Legendary Legacy Expansion digital version in PDF format for your print-and-play pleasures.If you think Elemental Clash is something you would like to play with your friends and family, back the project on the intermediate levels which will get you professionally printed copies of the game.If you deem the project worthy of considerable montetary support and if you ever wanted to be in or contribute to a fantasy CCG, the higher levels might be something for you to consider. At these levels you will get the chance to design 1 or even 2 cards yourself, to be included in the upcoming Legendary Legacy Expansion as well as a huge package of goodies such as copies of the game and a poster featurnig amazing artwork right out of the game. You can either have yourself ""immortalized"" on an Elemental Clash card, have a friend or loved one immortalized, which would make for a great surprise or gift for any card gamer, or design any card you can think of, to be included in the expansion. Here are some samples so you see what my artists are capable of when it comes to depicting the likenesses of supporters of the game:If this project does not reach its goal of $2500 USD, any funds raised will go 100% towards creating the artwork for the Elemental  Clash: Legendary Legacy expansion.So again, quite literally every dollar counts and is direly needed to release the expansion set on The Game Crafter towards the end of 1st Quarter 2014.Here's some ""Cool Factors"" that may help you decide if you want to give your support or not:
Get an amazing, indie Customizable Fantasy Card Game!

Ensure the future of the Elemental Clash Project!
Actively contribute to Elemental Clash with your card idea(s)!

<p><strong>Wouldn't it be great to be a part of history? Nik Wallenda achieved his lifelong dream of walking across the Grand Canyon untethered and doing so, strong in his faith and conviction. His message was to inspire others to dream and achieve the impossible and to always keep trying.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This is our chance to be part of chess history:</strong></p>
<p>Coach Mike Hoffer is my son's chess teacher. We are here to support his dream of competing and winning the World Chess Open this July. He has been training National Champions since 1994 and now it is his turn to claim his spot at this prestigious venue. Throughout his coaching career he has been devoted to training young children of all ages, nationalities, and abilities to pursue their interest in chess and hone it into a winning skill while mastering good sportsmanship. My family has seen what his coaching can do turning our shy 8 year old son into a winning competitor locally in a matter of a few months. Our fundraising efforts are our way of saying ""Thank You Coach Mike!"" </p>
<p>If you were wondering about his track record, he has been a Chess Correspondence Champion for many years, 1989 TCC North American Correspondence Champion, undefeated with 62 wins &amp; 9 draws, clear 1st place in all 10 events, is rated 2800+ Internet Chess Club, &amp; has won many USCF events.</p>
<p>His achievements are highlighted on Yes2Chess.com, yet I would like to share something that you will not read there. Coach Mike was recently diagnosed with diabetes &amp; sleep apnea. His strong work ethic and devotion to his family and chess students took center stage through his career and his health suffered. He dropped 70 pounds after the diagnosis and has since been learning how to manage his diabetes through proper nutrition and exercise. He is now again ready for competition and we think he deserves every chance possible of getting to the World Open.</p>
<p>If you are still reading, thank you, and please consider contributing $25 or more, but any amount will be most appreciated. The real target goal is $1200 to cover fees, hotel, gas, and food. This is a short campaign as Coach Mike needs to arrive in DC by July 3, so time is of the essence and that is why the goal stated is $500. </p>
<p>And reaching that goal is important because the fee will only be 4% if it is reached, it becomes 9% if it does not. It's wonderful that many who have read this campaign have donated directly to Coach Mike, but if you haven't yet please consider doing so on this campaign. </p>
<p>The quickest and easiest way to donate is through PayPal. You do not need a PayPal account to use their service. It's quick, easy and painless and Coach doesn't have to wait till next week for the funds, it's instant. </p>
<p>We understand that this may find you unable to contribute and we hope that things look better for you soon. Could you please help us by passing this on to your FB friends and contacts? If you are able to help out ""THANK YOU"" for helping one man live out his dream and proving to himself that he still has it in him to compete. </p>
<p>To sweeten your contribution our online company fivestarskin.com is giving perks for contributions. Thank You in advance!</p>
<p>Much success and happiness to you,</p>

<h3>
<i>Expand</i> your Farm!</h3>
<p>In this game you'll play as a newcomer farmer in a semifuturistic setting who must build up from modest beginnings and progress to success through strategic planning, resource management and lots of fun with the NPC's!</p>
<p>I'm a guy who loves BE, cowgirls and games. I'm a wacky programmer and dedicated expansion story writer who loves to get great things done. I've participated in other visual novel projects such as Minddrone and Choun Yurr own Adventure, and with your help, I'd like to develop an in-depth, interesting and visually awesome game. A Cow Girl Farmer game. If you can help me out a bit, we can make this experience a reality. Here is what its all about:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3></h3>
<p></p>
<h3>Gameplay:</h3>
<p>The game has two main parts:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/62388/files/20130909062347-chee.png?1378733027"" src="""" style=""""/> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/62391/files/20130909062901-whw.png?1378733341"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b><i>Part 1: Social Interaction: </i></b>Your relationship with the NPCs is very important, and it will be mainly done through a Visual Novel-like experience. Discover the lives and unique personalities of your fellow farmers and friends as you delve into quests and explore the unique personalities of cowgirls as you develop your bonds. And who knows, maybe you just might find something special :3. Romance is included in the game, in the form of ""Scenes"" - intense sentimental moments. Important desicions will be made as this segment will be choice-heavy. Will you ask an NPC out with a sly joke or will you just ask her directly? Everthing counts - make the most of your memory and skill to achieve your conquest! </li>
<li>
<i>Interrupt function: </i>Unlike conventional Visual Novels, CGF allows you to interrupt the flow of events at any time to make an intervention. Maybe you want to have more details on a certain issue or maybe you need to give a little push to a shyer character. Interrupt lets you do precisely that.</li>
<li>
<i>Stats &amp; Predisposition: </i>Characters have different, unique personalities. The game uses two stats to measure your relation with others: Intimacy (how much they have ""Opened up"" to you) and Love (Romantic interest). The progress of these stats are influenced by each characters predisposition - a shy character will have a hard time raising her Intimacy with others wereas a lovestruck one will have an easy time raising her Love stat. However, the players interaction with the NPC's will ultimately decide which course thier relation take.</li>
</ul>
<br/><p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/62386/files/20130909061638-cheese.png?1378732598"" src="""" style=""width: 199.57471264367817px; height: 179px;""/>   <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/62387/files/20130909061922-che.png?1378732762"" src="""" style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em; width: 203.68421052631578px; height: 180px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">
<b><i>Part 2: Strategy and Management: </i></b>Scheduele your livestock's timetable with different activities and decide the proper diet. Contact different companies and individuals to get hold of clues, special products (foods, pills, equipment), and more profit. Analyze, decide and <i>grow</i>!</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">
<i>Scheduele:</i> You have three timeslots per livestock. Each slot can be filled with a different activity that can be progressively improved as a skill.</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">
<i>Diet:</i> They have to eat! Nutrition is important, and depending on your diet choices, growth and progress will occur in one area or another.</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">
<i>Emails:</i> Contacting your allies is important. Negociate, make buisness and get info on the latest changes in the market so that you don't get left behind.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>

<p>Every dialogue, every text description and action will take into account its context, and create the story with <b>generative grammar</b>. What does this mean? Not only does this mean that gameplay experience will have millions of possibilities, If you're talking to a fat NPC who giggles a lot, the system will take that into account and modify the descriptive narration accordingly, by ""filling in"" the gaps that have been pre-set as sentance syntax - which will take one form or another (Deep/Surface) depending on what the NPC is thinking and wants to say, or what is appriopriate for the narrator to describe, in the line of the giggling fat NPC in this example. Not only will the narration adapt to the enviroment, it will also mutate to create different phrases, adding to a more colorful and engaging experience.</p>
<p>Within this, each character has thier own personality, mannerisms and vocal patterns. One character may use ""I like strawberries"" in one situation whereas another would use ""In my opinion, strawberries are great"". Context-free grammar is just awesome!</p>

In this game you'll play as a newcomer farmer in a semifuturistic setting who must build up from modest beginnings and progress to success through strategic planning, resource management and lots of fun with the NPC's!
I'm a guy who loves BE, cowgirls and games. I'm a wacky programmer and dedicated expansion story writer who loves to get great things done. I've participated in other visual novel projects such as Minddrone and Choun Yurr own Adventure, and with your help, I'd like to develop an in-depth, interesting and visually awesome game. A Cow Girl Farmer game. If you can help me out a bit, we can make this experience a reality. Here is what its all about:




Gameplay:
The game has two main parts:

 


Part 1: Social Interaction: Your relationship with the NPCs is very important, and it will be mainly done through a Visual Novel-like experience. Discover the lives and unique personalities of your fellow farmers and friends as you delve into quests and explore the unique personalities of cowgirls as you develop your bonds. And who knows, maybe you just might find something special :3. Romance is included in the game, in the form of ""Scenes"" - intense sentimental moments. Important desicions will be made as this segment will be choice-heavy. Will you ask an NPC out with a sly joke or will you just ask her directly? Everthing counts - make the most of your memory and skill to achieve your conquest! 

Interrupt function: Unlike conventional Visual Novels, CGF allows you to interrupt the flow of events at any time to make an intervention. Maybe you want to have more details on a certain issue or maybe you need to give a little push to a shyer character. Interrupt lets you do precisely that.

Stats & Predisposition: Characters have different, unique personalities. The game uses two stats to measure your relation with others: Intimacy (how much they have ""Opened up"" to you) and Love (Romantic interest). The progress of these stats are influenced by each characters predisposition - a shy character will have a hard time raising her Intimacy with others wereas a lovestruck one will have an easy time raising her Love stat. However, the players interaction with the NPC's will ultimately decide which course thier relation take.




   



Part 2: Strategy and Management: Scheduele your livestock's timetable with different activities and decide the proper diet. Contact different companies and individuals to get hold of clues, special products (foods, pills, equipment), and more profit. Analyze, decide and grow!

Scheduele: You have three timeslots per livestock. Each slot can be filled with a different activity that can be progressively improved as a skill.

Diet: They have to eat! Nutrition is important, and depending on your diet choices, growth and progress will occur in one area or another.

Emails: Contacting your allies is important. Negociate, make buisness and get info on the latest changes in the market so that you don't get left behind.



The cows are procedually generated. What does this mean? Given its amount of ""pieces"", the system sensibly tailors a co. As of now, there should about about millions of different permutations, considering personality details, innate talents and appearance traits.
The cows appearance (including thier growth) will be generated from the pieces, similarly how other Girl Maker games work, but in 2D. In order to get the pieces and to make the graphics accurate, I need to make a collaborative effort between artists (who need to be comissioned) and myself (coding) 

Day by Day
Gameplay itself will be segmented into days, in a dating sim-like structure. At the beginning of each day, you will check and plan (scheduele, dieting) your day, as well as answer and deliver emails. After that, you will play the day itself.
Playing the day will be like playing a visual novel (Like Katawa Shoujou) - but much more interactive. You will be presented with a novel-like storyline and events that occurr according to your schueduele. However, you may interrupt the flow to make an intervention - and even the NPCs will sometimes do the same too!
Here is the interesting part:





Every dialogue, every text description and action will take into account its context, and create the story with generative grammar. What does this mean? Not only does this mean that gameplay experience will have millions of possibilities, If you're talking to a fat NPC who giggles a lot, the system will take that into account and modify the descriptive narration accordingly, by ""filling in"" the gaps that have been pre-set as sentance syntax - which will take one form or another (Deep/Surface) depending on what the NPC is thinking and wants to say, or what is appriopriate for the narrator to describe, in the line of the giggling fat NPC in this example. Not only will the narration adapt to the enviroment, it will also mutate to create different phrases, adding to a more colorful and engaging experience.
Within this, each character has thier own personality, mannerisms and vocal patterns. One character may use ""I like strawberries"" in one situation whereas another would use ""In my opinion, strawberries are great"". Context-free grammar is just awesome!

Who's Making this Super Word Game?
MoxieArts was founded by Eric Petersen who has over 20 years of game development and design experience.  After working for Electronic Arts and Midway Games, he was inspired to set out on his own to create an original word game that adds a twist on classic favorites. MoxieArts contracted ARB Studios, based on their success of multiple mobile apps, to develop Grabble.

<p>Despite there will be place for exploration, puzzles and obstacles, the main point of the game is the combat. We want to make it as diverse as possible, yet understandable, to give you a lot space for creativity and style. There will also be a leveling system, which we will show in later updates here.</p>
<p>Here's an example of a simple combo you can do:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/BFQ1Swh.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Not every attack/combo will be good against different monsters. For example, you shouldn't use a slow charged attack against a quick monster or a group of them. What you can do is to knock them back first, or to not let them hit you by using something fast. Some of the harder enemies will require a unique approach, like those who are protected from the front, but vulnerable from the back, and, of course, every boss.</p>

This is a game app for people on the move, running on the mobile platform, you can play it offline and online. Our company, Snowdrifts, is a family owned company solely setup to create this project and if it succeeds, The Last Prince 2 will also be beautifully made, having all your possessions from The Last Prince transferred over in various ways so any purchases made, and achievements unlocked will not be lost ever!
Our game design of The Last Prince, is made by Alan and a group supportive friends and family members who contributes their various skills to its development. The programming is outsourced to The Rocket Studio, a mobile app developer with many years of experience in mobile app development in Singapore
We have actively played games throughout the release of wonderful old school titles on various platforms like the famous FF7, Azure Dreams, Xenogear, Chrono cross, Suikoden 2 and Atelier, just to name a few, We grouped together to form our company, Snowdrifts, in order to create games that match or exceed the high-expectations of gaming quality in the mobile industry

With this goal in mind, our team gathered to create an interesting game design, never seen before on this platform or perhaps even in the extensive history of gaming. With solid packed content and polished it over and over like fine art, we wanted to deliver an uncompromised piece of work for your entertainment. We are proud to present The Last Prince.

An
action-packed, savage wilderness and greedy civilizations…. you are in the center of it all as a....Young merchant? Well, do your best but don't expect people to be kinder to you since you're only twelve. Join us in this exciting story filled with
intriguing choices and strategy in which every path to what you desire must
carved out by your own two hands.
We bring to you
a young noble, separated from his family by greed and entering the world alone,
armed with only his wits.
Enter into a
savage world on your mobile device that requires heavy strategic planning on your part
just to survive. You will need to raise funds, forge equipment, hunt for extremely rare eggs of fearsome monsters & demons that had given you pain and hatch as your companions, nurture them and they will serve you well. Solve puzzles, customize your adventurer and upgrade your town, your deeds will not go unrewarded!
But do you desire more than just surviving? Then you have to decide your ultimate goal! Mold your own story for revenge on the world, or perhaps by your choice to look for Fame or Fortune. Maybe it is in your preference to build your empire or a wish to sit upon the throne? The world is yours for the taking, and you to decide what to do with it through your choices!
But first, we
have to start at the beginning. 



Gameplay
You will run an item shop, not too unlike your very own lemonade stall, where your popularity and success will greatly determine your profits. 
The game will place you in a similar role as the head of a corporation, and in-game mechanics will assist you in place of a company's accountant, pricing department or other valuable departments that you'll find in most companies.
Prices of items on display in your shop will be pre-determined by various factors, and you can fully immerse yourself with larger business decisions, investments and upgrading. Your only resources are time and money.

You will also take control of your hero; a partner to you, whom ventures into the wilderness. The play style is turn-based and revolutionized! Hostiles will not die when defeated, but turn into valuable friendly units for that battle, and the condition for winning is to convert all hostiles into your friends! Beware, you will be facing overwhelming enemies forces, be prepared or you'll lose your lives and items.

Please note that this game is geared towards a challenging difficulty, you will need to be ready for losses as all business encompasses risks, each venture into the wild could reap priceless rewards or spell the doom of your adventure...

<p>Virtual reality as a concept has been around for the last 40 years, but until recently it was more of a fantasy. Many of us had our interest piqued in 2012 with the Oculus crowdfunding project only to learn we would still be tethered to a supercomputer. <b>In 2014, Google introduced ‘Google Cardboard’ and DODOcase became the first company to supply Cardboard VR viewers to the world. </b>We pioneered the space with the capacity touch functionality of our V1.2 and the ease of assembly of our Pop Up series of viewers. We even invested over $60K in open source software development via our DIYVR campaign to try to accelerate web-based VR development tools for easier and more accessible content production. For the last two years, we’ve been a leader in the Works with Cardboard program selling viewers directly to consumers but also working with brands and advertisers such as The North Face, Elle Magazine, Conan O’Brien and 100s more to deliver customized VR experiences to their fans.</p>
<br/><p>Working closely with dozens of industry professionals and with the experience of delivering 10,000+ consumer demos, we arrived at SMARTvr. We realized that as amazing as Cardboard VR is for your first taste of VR, in order to consume all the VR content that is pouring onto our smartphones, we needed something more portable and more durable. SMARTvr is the result of all these inputs. We wanted to build a product that would be your conduit to all the amazing content being created for your mobile phone. </p>

<p><span></span>Founded in 2010, DODOcase has been known globally for its tablet and phone accessories. In June 2014, DODOcase launched the first consumer Cardboard Virtual Reality headset and became Google's first partner in the Works with Cardboard program. We quickly became the source for quality Virtual Reality headsets and partnered with the world's premiere VR content producers. After 1000s of discussions with consumers and partners we developed SMARTvr. We can't wait to continue to define the smartphone VR market with you.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>

<p>SMARTvr supports all Android and iOS (Apple) Smartphones (iPhone 5 and wider). Our experience is that VR apps run best on Android 4.2 or greater / iOS 7 or greater. </p>
<br/><p><b>Can I leave my phone case on?</b></p>

<p>We are based in the Dogpatch Neighborhood of San Francisco. Yes, you are welcome to stop by.</p>
<br/><p><b>Why don't you have a head strap?</b></p>
<p>By requiring users to hold SMARTvr to their faces, we engage the entire torso when swiveling around enjoying VR experiences. An engaged torso helps retain equilibrium when standing using your viewer. This allows SMARTvr to be enjoyed in any environment. This is also a mandate of the 'Works with Cardboard' certification program from Google. </p>
<br/><p><b>Are you in the 'Works with Cardboard' program?</b></p>
<p>Yes, we were Google's first partner in the Works with Cardboard program dating back to 2014. We have a great working relationship with the Cardboard team which insures our products are the highest quality in the world. </p>

<p>Our 34 mm biconvex lens are made from acrylic. </p>
<br/><p><b>How do I install a neck lanyard onto SMARTvr?</b></p>
<p>You'll notice a slot in each of the metal hinges. Simply slot the cable through the hole and loop your lanyard through. </p>
<br/><p><b>Where was this product designed?</b></p>
<p>SMARTvr was designed in San Francisco, CA <em>with </em>engineers from MIT and San Jose State with advise from an ex Apple engineer.</p>
<br/><p><b>Can I create my own VR content?</b></p>
<p>Yes, simply phone apps like 'Cardboard Camera' can be used to great photo spheres. You may also use specifically designed 360 cameras such as 360Fly, Giroptic and Ricoh Theta to create content. </p>
<br/><p><b>Who will enjoy this product?</b></p>
<p>In short, everyone. We see an explosion of uses of VR from professional to entertainment. SMARTvr is designed to travel with you everywhere so you can enjoy content wherever you go. </p>
<br/><p><b>How do I hear the audio?</b></p>
<p>SMARTvr provides access to the audio port of your phone so you can enjoy sound via standard headphones or directly from your phone's speakers. </p>
<br/><p><b>Is the lens cover removable?</b></p>
<p>Yes</p>
<br/><p><b>How do I remove the lens cover?</b></p>
<p>Pinch the edge of the lens cover between your thumb and forefinger, pull up the corner slightly and slide the cover out either side. The cover sits in a U shaped slot on the top of SMARTvr. The slot has opening on either sides for removal. To reinsert, slot the cover rod into the U shape slot and slide across. </p>
<br/><p><b>What does the lens cover do?</b></p>
<p>The lens cover serves two primary purposes. 1) When not in use, the cover protects the lenses from scratches when in your pocket or bag. 2) While in use, the lens cover provides a shield from ambient light entering from above which aids in the sense of immersion. </p>
<br/><p><b>I'm planning on buying an Oculus, Vive or Playstation VR, why would I want this?</b></p>
<p>Smartphone VR is all about being on the go and being able to share experiences with friends. We love the high fidelity systems, but they will occupy a different part of the VR market and are designed for use in your home. SMARTvr will be your gateway to thousands of VR experiences and will allow you to show VR to friends and family with ease.

Virtual reality as a concept has been around for the last 40 years, but until recently it was more of a fantasy. Many of us had our interest piqued in 2012 with the Oculus crowdfunding project only to learn we would still be tethered to a supercomputer. In 2014, Google introduced ‘Google Cardboard’ and DODOcase became the first company to supply Cardboard VR viewers to the world. We pioneered the space with the capacity touch functionality of our V1.2 and the ease of assembly of our Pop Up series of viewers. We even invested over $60K in open source software development via our DIYVR campaign to try to accelerate web-based VR development tools for easier and more accessible content production. For the last two years, we’ve been a leader in the Works with Cardboard program selling viewers directly to consumers but also working with brands and advertisers such as The North Face, Elle Magazine, Conan O’Brien and 100s more to deliver customized VR experiences to their fans.
Working closely with dozens of industry professionals and with the experience of delivering 10,000+ consumer demos, we arrived at SMARTvr. We realized that as amazing as Cardboard VR is for your first taste of VR, in order to consume all the VR content that is pouring onto our smartphones, we needed something more portable and more durable. SMARTvr is the result of all these inputs. We wanted to build a product that would be your conduit to all the amazing content being created for your mobile phone. 







Founded in 2010, DODOcase has been known globally for its tablet and phone accessories. In June 2014, DODOcase launched the first consumer Cardboard Virtual Reality headset and became Google's first partner in the Works with Cardboard program. We quickly became the source for quality Virtual Reality headsets and partnered with the world's premiere VR content producers. After 1000s of discussions with consumers and partners we developed SMARTvr. We can't wait to continue to define the smartphone VR market with you.

What types of phones are supported by SMARTvr?
SMARTvr supports all Android and iOS (Apple) Smartphones (iPhone 5 and wider). Our experience is that VR apps run best on Android 4.2 or greater / iOS 7 or greater. 
Can I leave my phone case on?
SMARTvr can accommodate most slim cases. We recommend you proceed slowly if you have any question as you do not want to bend the arms beyond their base.

We are based in the Dogpatch Neighborhood of San Francisco. Yes, you are welcome to stop by.
Why don't you have a head strap?
By requiring users to hold SMARTvr to their faces, we engage the entire torso when swiveling around enjoying VR experiences. An engaged torso helps retain equilibrium when standing using your viewer. This allows SMARTvr to be enjoyed in any environment. This is also a mandate of the 'Works with Cardboard' certification program from Google. 
Are you in the 'Works with Cardboard' program?
Yes, we were Google's first partner in the Works with Cardboard program dating back to 2014. We have a great working relationship with the Cardboard team which insures our products are the highest quality in the world. 
What are your lens made from?
Our 34 mm biconvex lens are made from acrylic. 
How do I install a neck lanyard onto SMARTvr?
You'll notice a slot in each of the metal hinges. Simply slot the cable through the hole and loop your lanyard through. 
Where was this product designed?
SMARTvr was designed in San Francisco, CA with engineers from MIT and San Jose State with advise from an ex Apple engineer.
Can I create my own VR content?
Yes, simply phone apps like 'Cardboard Camera' can be used to great photo spheres. You may also use specifically designed 360 cameras such as 360Fly, Giroptic and Ricoh Theta to create content. 
Who will enjoy this product?
In short, everyone. We see an explosion of uses of VR from professional to entertainment. SMARTvr is designed to travel with you everywhere so you can enjoy content wherever you go. 
How do I hear the audio?
SMARTvr provides access to the audio port of your phone so you can enjoy sound via standard headphones or directly from your phone's speakers.

Yes

The slot has opening on either sides for removal. To reinsert, slot the cover rod into the U shape slot and slide across.

The lens cover serves two primary purposes. 1) When not in use, the cover protects the lenses from scratches when in your pocket or bag. 2) While in use, the lens cover provides a shield from ambient light entering from above which aids in the sense of immersion. 
I'm planning on buying an Oculus, Vive or Playstation VR, why would I want this?
Smartphone VR is all about being on the go and being able to share experiences with friends. We love the high fidelity systems, but they will occupy a different part of the VR market and are designed for use in your home. SMARTvr will be your gateway to thousands of VR experiences and will allow you to show VR to friends and family with ease. Remember, the only way to explain VR is to try VR!",53.0,4,"20 Campaigns

<h3><strong>Imagine being part of a team of marine archaeologists as they pinpoint the location of a historical shipwreck.

<h3><strong>Arqueonautas is a marine archaeological company that has been looking for and recovering ship wrecks for over 17 years.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>Recently they have paired up with a team of young game developers that have been turning their day to day adventures into a challenging and realistic game.</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>The Game</strong></h3>
<p>In this game the player will experience all the joys and frustrations of leading a treasure quest. Through Arqueonautas extensive experience this game is going to be as real as it gets.</p>
<p>The game is being developed for PC and is intend to be released on multiple platforms</p>
<p>Expeditions are extremely expensive so in order to survive the cutthroat competition the player must manage his team and resources very well.</p>
<p>The player must hire his team, chose a location, get historical archival research, apply to government licenses, get financing, buy boats and buy equipment.</p>

<p>When the expedition is launched he must stock up on supplies, such as, water, fuel, food, spare parts and diving supplies that will enable him to search, find and remain the maximum time at the wreck location.</p>
<p>The player must survey the seabed and send down divers once the wreck is positively identified.</p>
<p>During excavations the player must manage his divers work by assigning tasks such as scanning with a metal detector, marking an area, excavating or lifting objects to the surface. He must also pay close attention to the air available in the tanks and decompression time.</p>

Practice your dating skills from the comfort of your home



We want to save men and women from awkwardness, eerie silences and bad conversations. SAY SOMETHING will turn confusing first dates into an enjoyable, fun play.
That's the promise of SAY SOMETHING, an iPhone app designed to introduce users to other singles, allowing them to practice their chat up lines and dating conversations. From the FIRST CONVERSATION all the way to a DATE. Its all completely anonymous so users never meet. We can proudly say this is the first app of its kind in the world! 



What is the Problem with Dating? 




50% of all single adults now use online dating

80% of these users have a terrible first experience

That's a BIG problem!
How do we know? We love facts - they tell the truth. So we analyse and study online and mobile dating behaviour or real people. By the way, we have just presented our latest Online Dating Deconstructed 2013 study at Google Campus.  




The reason?
The biggest reason for failed dates is lack of dating skills - awkward dates and boring conversations. 


We have the solution!






We want to stop people getting slapped on their first date!
The app allows men to practice their conversational and dating skills with real women. It presents a situation, for example, 'You're standing at a bar and she smiles at you', then asks the player to type what they would say. Female players can immediately give feedback, giving it thumbs-up or down. Then they also type their response, to which the men can provide feedback too. 
So SAY SOMETHING uses CROWD SOURCING to gather dating advice. In other words the more you play, the more valuable feedback you get.

There are two key premises:


Dating practice is virtual, players will not meet in real life;
No direct personal contact makes honest feedback possible.








Where the idea came from


A few years ago when I tried online dating, I send over 50 messages to potential dates only to see 2 responses. Including an 'out of office' auto reply. True story :) I asked a few experts for advice, but there gurus often contradicted themselves.
Then it hit me: Dating is personal and what works for one person, may not work for another. Dating advice MUST be personal!
It seems like a revolutionary idea. As a matter of fact, it is. It makes dating gurus obsolete. Luckily we don't need them anymore, because with SAY SOMETHING people can help each other just by playing a simple game.  



We are going for Gold!
We have already developed two other apps with over 23 thousand happy users. Sure, we learn every day and are humbled by our customers' feedback. Yet, this is not our first app project and we know how to make it happen. We know that when we say we will go live in Oct 2013, we will. That is our team's promise.




We are crazy about constructive feedback, it makes us work harder. We also like positive feedback and are happy to share it with you. Our prototype has been shortlisted for the Most Innovative Dating Service Award of 2013! This is the Oscars of the dating world! The deadline for final votes is Oct 31st, we will launch on Oct 1st. As you can see, we HAVE to launch on time. 

Meet the team behind SAY SOMETHING:

We are passionate about helping others help themselves. There is nothing more fulfilling in the world for us.

Fish Astronaut - Concept Art
What is Fish Astronaut?
Fish Astronaut came from an idea that big things can happen to little people if they put all their effort in it, even if it collides with nature.

Fish Astronaut - The Fish
The game itself will feature great graphics, retina display for the iphone, hi-def images for other platforms, with an original soundtrack being composed by a Puerto Rican composer with many years making good music.

Fish Astronaut - Rocket Transformations
The game will feature 3 main stages, Underwater, Air, Space. Each of these stages will have their own obstacles, feel and of course rocket; which also means different maneuverability for every rocket.

Fish Astronaut - Game Launch Pad and Some Obstacles
It will feature a ""title"" system in which the player has to do certain objectives according to which title he's got. And the higher the title the more score (multiplier) he's got.

Fish Astronaut - Early Launch Pad Concept
The stars you collet on the actual flight can be used to buy upgrades to the ship, to reach further and further every time you launch. Until you reach your destination, the Moon. High replay-ability value.

<h3>The Impact</h3>My name is Christian and I started an Artists Collective called Solo 
Projects Studios for aspiring creators of games and films. Since 2008 we
 have been self funded and slowly building up to going public. Currently
 Rogue has 4 people on it's crew and needs and additional 6 artists to 
complete it. On the 18th of April we were awarded the use of the 
HeroEngine(<a href=""http://swtor.gamingfeeds.com/2011/02/13/heroengine-owner-idea-fabrik-founds-new-us-dev-studio/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">link</a>) for a second project. This is one of the most powerful 
MMO engines in the world and a true opportunity to expand and help 
dozens of artists. At this point I realized that I could no longer fund 
all that was happening alone. Completing Rogue is critical in that it 
will contribute to profits, but it also opens the door for improvements 
on future projects. Nothing breeds success better then success. All 
Artists will receive a share of the profits for the entire lifespan of 
the game.<br/>

<h3>Story Prologue</h3>One of the last memorable moments of the American Revolution was 
Benjamin Franklin’s invention of the“High Torque Gearbox."" When asked 
what his inspiration was, he stated that it was an accidental discovery.
 He had originally planned on flying a kite during a lightning storm to 
test some theories but the storm dissipated. So instead, he stayed home 
and attempted to fix his broken clock. That was the moment when 
inspiration hit.<br/><br/>
Sadly America’s history of ingenuity, hope, and independence   seems to 
have ended there. General Washington fled to parts unknown to avoid 
Prosecution for various High Morale crimes. Shortly after, the American 
Revolution was swiftly crushed.<br/><br/>
The British Empire chose wisely to use the Americas as a base of 
operation to expand their influence worldwide. The Native population was
 used as a labor force and breeding stock to add to Britain’s population
 for the ever expanding campaign of land conquest.<br/><br/>
In the final days of the campaign Russia and Asia were the last 
hold-outs. The Queen annexed Germany’s strongest troops (a group known 
as the S.S), and the Natives from the America territory, then hit Russia
 with a final deadly blow. It was just a matter of time after that. Asia
 fell in less then a year. To their credit, they were fierce enemies and
 the death toll was so large that decades later, Germany’s male 
population still has not fully recovered.<br/><br/>
Today the world is in a perpetual state of Renaissance thanks to the 
Empire. Churches were unified into a single institution ""The Royal 
Angelical Church”. As the protectors of Morality and Goodness they were 
put in charge of the arts and sciences. Under their control society 
maintains an acceptable moral balance. A few years after the war, the 
royal family pressured the church to accept the use of magic and 
alchemy. Under the Queen's steady pressure (and a few beheadings) the 
Church accepted these fields as sciences ordained by God. They are 
closely monitored by the church and are rumored to have increased the 
wealth of the Empire greatly.<br/><br/>
Every individual is comforted by knowing their place in society. The 
class system has become accepted as the norm. Now a man can relax and 
spend his life working and caring for his family without the pressure to
 become anything beyond his means. Families prosper knowing that what 
they have today, they will have tomorrow. Of course there is some 
shifting of social and political power through marriage, but this is 
minor compared to the stable structure the Royal House was gracious 
enough to give to us all.<br/><br/>
Do not fret citizen, the rumors of Rogues openly defying the Royal House
 are simply not true. These are fairy tales used to scare children. 
After all, who could know better then the Crown and the Church how every
 man should live his life.</div><div>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">eSports meets IT Training</h2>
<p> </p> <h3>HOW IT WORKZ</h3>
<ol>
<li>Young people (ages 16-24) will engage in practice individually for 4 weeks at multiple Detroit Public Library branches. They will input Python code to move characters further into the game.</li>
<li>At the end of practice, students with the most progress in game will combine into teams for a multiplayer bracket tournament.</li>
<li>FINAL eSPORT COMPETITION FOR CASH PRIZE in front of a LIVE  audience.</li>
<li>Winners will be offered FREE admission to the Programming Essentials in Python Course, a 16 week instructor-led that prepares them for the Python Certified Associate Programmer certification and jobs earning an average of $103,492.</li>

</div></div>","SUMMARY
 
I  am Ida Byrd-Hill, Director of Automation Workz 4 U,  a Cisco Networking Academy that provides certification training for those  ages 16+ in the IT Professional Trades of computer networking, computer programming, cybersecurity, data analytics and quality. Uplift, Inc. began AUTOMATION WORKZ 4 U December 2017
 
Uplift, Inc. registered 360 Detroit residents for Introduction to IoT and Intro to Cybersecurity class  -- 90% People of Color, 60% Women, 51% over the age of 40 and 12.5% below age of 18 Perplexed that we have  registered a few student ages 16-24 for our FREE IT certification training, I began to look for ways to attract them to our program. I asked a young person to sample the video game prototype we had just developed when the young person stated, ""I wish school was like a video game.""
 
 

eSports meets IT Training
  HOW IT WORKZ

Young people (ages 16-24) will engage in practice individually for 4 weeks at multiple Detroit Public Library branches. They will input Python code to move characters further into the game.
At the end of practice, students with the most progress in game will combine into teams for a multiplayer bracket tournament.
FINAL eSPORT COMPETITION FOR CASH PRIZE in front of a LIVE  audience.
Winners will be offered FREE admission to the Programming Essentials in Python Course, a 16 week instructor-led that prepares them for the Python Certified Associate Programmer certification and jobs earning an average of $103,492.
 Uplift, Inc. piloted this concept at a charter school, Covenant House Academy -SW
LOOK AT HOW FOCUSED THE STUDENTS ARE!!!!
 

While they are competing to win $100 dollars, they are learning Python an emerging computer language corporations are desperately seeking. TOP EMPLOYERS LOOKING FOR PYTHON DEVELOPERS

    
IT TRAINING in a VIDEO GAME Students learn Python programming as they play the game preparing them for industry certification as a Python computer programmer to secure one of the thousands of open jobs.

These young people join millions of others who have fallen in love with eSports - Video Game Competitions - where they compete for cash. Singularity Hub reports “This week, dozens of professional video game players will descend on Toronto during NXNE, an annual music and arts festival, to compete in different games for prizes of up to US$1,000. Not a bad payday, perhaps, but still chump change in the eSports scene. For example, Dota 2, a popular battle arena game published by Valve, recently handed out US$20 million to its top players during its finale.” “As a  spectator sport, video games generate viewership at least on par with professional leagues. “Take, for instance, 2016’s League of Legends tournament that drew 36 million viewers, five million more than the NBA Finals, in front of a sellout crowd at the famous Bird Nest stadium in China.” Bird Nest stadium seats 80,000 people.

The Goblin Trainee


The Goblin Brewmaster


The Goblin Lore Keeper

Tiny Little Bastards is a game about the love of a man for his beer. You’ll play as Ivarr, a viking tavern owner who had his tavern mysteriously sacked by a horde of annoying little creatures, the Goblins. Ivarr now has to take up arms to recover his stolen goods and save a desperate world from the severe beer drought the Goblins are causing.Through exploration, resolution of quests and dialogue options, player’s choices will have meaningful impact on the world - from little brother and sister fights to nation-wide conflicts such as civil wars and more!Our priority is to deliver you a game made with fun mechanics coupled by tight execution, focused on detailed gameplay that will keep players coming back to it. We aim for Tiny Little Bastards to be what we want to play ourselves.Tiny Little Bastards is a 2D platformer Action RPG for PC (windows, Mac & Linux). Its character progression is similar to action RPGs such as Diablo and Torchlight while the level design is deeply inspired by all-time classics like Castlevania.This means the player will be able to control character stats, talents and talent-based abilities while progressing in a vast and beautiful platform world with many bizarre, sometimes otherworldly regions, ranging from huge pumpkin dungeons to lands where sheep float in the sky!





The player will also be able to collect many different items such as weapons, trinkets, crafting materials, potions… and manage his own inventory. Items will be in ARPG-inspired style, appearing through the game by means of looting, crafting and exploration, as well as sold by charismatic vendors, and posessing a variety of randomized stats to allow for different playstyles.


To create strange potions and high value weapons, players can make use of the detailed crafting systems available. Each crafting system is attached to a different NPC (a smith can create weapons, a witch can make potions and an enchanter can craft trinkets). You’ll find a diverse cast of crafters with compelling backstories and quests along the way and, if they like you, they’ll follow you around the world making your journey more interesting!Through the journey, the player will have to overcome obstacles and puzzles based on the levels themselves. An infinity of dreadful traps and deadly pits are there to test your abilities, but you can beat them with the right moves and choices… if you’re skilled enough.The combat is simple and yet very detailed. A wide variety of enemies will try to block the way as the game goes on.The actual combat involves both player skill and stats:
Stamina will be drained when most actions are taken (especially using abilities)
Avoiding getting hit is crucial and equally items and talents will all play big part in deciding whether you’ll survive or not!
Every enemy will act acordingly to its own characteristics, so you’ll have to adapt your strategies on the fly.
A combination of good timing, knowledge of enemy patterns, resource management and smart character building are what makes the combat in Tiny Little Bastards a fun experience!

You can't always face your enemies with direct front hits. Remember, attacking consumes stamina!




Some foes take more damage while stunned.
The road will not be easy and there will be tons of obstacles on your way... Including awesome bosses, obviously!
We've been Greenlit in just 10 days! Thank you!Overlord Game Studio is an independent game studio. This means we do not have a sponsor or a publisher behind us to cover the development expenses.We are 100% dedicated to the development of Tiny Little Bastards and to do that, we had to quit our main jobs and focus all our energy at Overlord Game Studio and Tiny Little Bastards, and we did it because we love it. We have a strong passion for game devlopment and we wanna see our work become a reality.That's what drives us!  And for that, we’ll need your help as well.Chosing IndieGoGo enabled us to get in touch directly with the players and to transform Tiny Little Bastards into a game people would want to play! For this reason, we want you to be part of the team with us! Communication is the essence of what we’re trying to develop, a game WE ALL love!Making a great game, just like other great things, costs money. What we do with the money will define the outcome of the whole project and below is pie-chart (it's actually a shield-chart) defining the destination of the budget! ""When developing a game, history tells us that cake is the best fuel for creativity.

<p>Posse Creative LLC is a startup app design company located in Dallas, TX. Our first prototype of the Word Sphynx app (1.0) was approved for sale by Apple on the App Store on 02/03/2012. After extensive testing and feedback review, Posse Creative is ready to aggressively launch and market a retail version of Word Sphynx (2.0).  What’s different?  The new app – Word Sphynx 2.0 – will have a leaderboard for awarding prizes instead of a convoluted dungeon theme.</p>
<p>If you’re at all worried about us not having any “skin in the game” - don’t - we already have countless hours and closing in on $15,000 of our own money invested in this idea via development, legal, marketing and administrative fees.  We BELIEVE in this idea!  We have invested every spare dollar we had over the past two years into this project, but we need your help to cross the finish line.</p>
<h2>The GOAL </h2>
<p>The purpose of this Indiegogo campaign is to raise the money needed to COMPLETE development ($9,920), re-submit the app to Apple for approval (free), and BEGIN the hard work of marketing the app to players ($2,500).  Wait, that doesn't add up to your funding goal?  Yep, we've got to include 9% for Indiegogo ($1,118) and 3% for the credit card processing fees ($373).  We overreached on our previous crowdfunding efforts by trying to include an iAd campaign, but those are simply too expensive for our first marketing efforts (about $15,000).  We believe we can accomplish the needed marketing using virool.com (video marketing) for a fraction of the iAd campaign.  Of course, our greatest marketing resources will be YOU.</p>
<p>Perks.  YOU are an integral part of this campaign and will be rewarded for your contribution.  Even $1 will earn you a perk.  For every $1 you support us with, we’ll MATCH with in-game currency once the app is live.  And the perks go up from there – check them out.</p>
<h2>The APP </h2>
<h3><strong><em>Word Sphynx's competitive edge:</em></strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>It's a new type of word puzzle game with a prize delivery system unlike anything on the App Store – you can win REAL rewards in the form of gift cards to major retailers. </li>
<li>It uses word clues to create word puzzles in a way that isn't being done anywhere else. </li>
<li>Word Sphynx's iOS app content rating is 4+ (not all apps can make this claim), which means it's available to all iPhone users young and old. <strong><em> </em></strong>
</li>
</ul><p><strong><em>Freemium:</em></strong><em> ""Freemium"" is a model that allows the app to be distributed for free, but has premium content for sale inside the app.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>IAP:</em></strong><em> Abbreviation for “In App Purchase” and the method by which only 4% of all apps are generating 72% of ALL iPhone App Store revenue (most use the “freemium” model).</em></p>
<p>Word Sphynx uses the ""freemium"" model and creates incentive for monetization through a prize delivery system. Quite simply, the biggest button on the screen (the “LEADERBOARD” button) reveals the prize competition for that week. We’ve got a strong understanding of who our players will be and are rewarding them for their efforts. We know this because we ARE players &amp; gamers ourselves - we have downloaded, played and spent many hours and a lot of money on many of the top rated apps on the App Store for years. As gamers ourselves, this is what we would want. If our core demographic changes, we can adjust the rewards being offered. </p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h2>
<p>If you can’t support Word Sphynx with a contribution, PLEASE help us by spreading the word.  Use the links below the video to share this project with your friends.  Here are some additional ways you can help:</p>
<h3>Follow us on Twitter &amp; Like us on Facebook (at our website):</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.wordsphynx.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WordSphynx.com</a></p>
<h3>Download Word Sphynx 1.0 so you’ll be immediately notified when Word Sphynx 2.0 is AVAILABLE:</h3>
<p><a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/word-sphynx/id487668639?mt=8&amp;uo=4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""itunes_store""><img alt=""Word Sphynx - Posse Creative"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://r.mzstatic.com/images/web/linkmaker/badge_appstore-lrg.gif"" src="""" style=""border: 0;""/></a></p>
<h3><strong><em>1) Is Word Sphynx simple enough for me to understand and buy into? </em></strong></h3>
<p>In a word, YES.  Simply put, it’s a word puzzle app with a unique prize delivery system. Apple has already approved the prototype. It’s been copyrighted and trademarked.</p>
<h3><strong><em>2) Does Word Sphynx solve a problem or meet a need? </em></strong></h3>
<p>Yes. It challenges the user to think creatively, and creates a friendly, competitive environment with a built in prize system. This allows the users to match their skills against thousands of others. The game is unique in two ways. 1 - it uses word clues to create word puzzle in a way that isn't being done anywhere else. 2 - it has a prize delivery system unlike anything on the App Store - you can win real rewards in the form of gift cards.</p>
<h3><strong>3) Is there a big enough market and customer base for Word Sphynx?</strong></h3>
<p>Yes.  The app content rating is 4+, which means it's available to all iPhone users young and old. The game caters to English speaking players, because the current word puzzles are in English. We are ready to react to demand and offer it in numerous languages.</p>
<h3><strong><em>4) Does Posse Creative have the right people on their team to pull it off?</em></strong></h3>
<p>Our current team includes the ""idea"" guy (Marc Jennings), a iOS developer, legal counsel and a marketing consultant. We've invested thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours into creating Word Sphynx. We've got skin in the game right now. </p>
<h3><strong><em>5) Do development duties reside with one person, or is there a team in place? </em></strong></h3>
<p>Initially, the puzzle making duties were handled by Marc Jennings. After realizing the potential danger in having the app “go dark” if new puzzles were not being created, Marc wrote a set of guidelines for puzzle making and shared it with family. Now puzzles are created by not just Marc, but by multiple family members and trusted friends. Believe it or not, the most creative puzzles have come from our kids and they continue to contribute weekly. After making an initial sweep through the entire dictionary to prove puzzles could be made long term, the database of puzzles currently holds near 1000 puzzles and we haven’t even made it out of the “A’s” in the dictionary. 1000 puzzles is about 1 year worth of content for Word Sphynx. </p>
<h3><strong><em>6) Why did we choose to launch on iOS and follow up on Android, Facebook? </em></strong></h3>
<p>The answer is in the statistics. According to recent data announced at the Apple WWDC (World Wide Developer's Conference), about 80% of all iOS users are using the latest OS platform while only about 5% (or less) of all Android users are running the latest OS version of that platform. What is the ""read"" here? iOS users appear to be more likely to adopt the latest software updates and download the latest app content. The Blackberry and Windows Mobile markets have shown consistent declines since 2010 and are trending downward. It is for that reason we have ruled out those markets in favor of the iOS and Android markets. The Facebook market may not be experiencing the exponential growth that it once was, but even as it begins to level out with 1 billion users (as of early Oct. 2012), we believe this will be a viable market for Word Sphynx outside of the mobile device customer base. The fact that nearly 40% of Facebook users are mobile app users provides an ideal opportunity for cross promotion.</p>

Perks.  YOU are an integral part of this campaign and will be rewarded for your contribution.  Even $1 will earn you a perk.  For every $1 you support us with, we’ll MATCH with in-game currency once the app is live.  And the perks go up from there – check them out.
The APP 
Word Sphynx's competitive edge:

It's a new type of word puzzle game with a prize delivery system unlike anything on the App Store – you can win REAL rewards in the form of gift cards to major retailers. 
It uses word clues to create word puzzles in a way that isn't being done anywhere else. 
Word Sphynx's iOS app content rating is 4+ (not all apps can make this claim), which means it's available to all iPhone users young and old.  

Freemium: ""Freemium"" is a model that allows the app to be distributed for free, but has premium content for sale inside the app.
IAP: Abbreviation for “In App Purchase” and the method by which only 4% of all apps are generating 72% of ALL iPhone App Store revenue (most use the “freemium” model).
Word Sphynx uses the ""freemium"" model and creates incentive for monetization through a prize delivery system. Quite simply, the biggest button on the screen (the “LEADERBOARD” button) reveals the prize competition for that week. We’ve got a strong understanding of who our players will be and are rewarding them for their efforts. We know this because we ARE players & gamers ourselves - we have downloaded, played and spent many hours and a lot of money on many of the top rated apps on the App Store for years. As gamers ourselves, this is what we would want. If our core demographic changes, we can adjust the rewards being offered. 
Other Ways You Can Help
If you can’t support Word Sphynx with a contribution, PLEASE help us by spreading the word.  Use the links below the video to share this project with your friends.  Here are some additional ways you can help:
Follow us on Twitter & Like us on Facebook (at our website):
WordSphynx.com
Download Word Sphynx 1.0 so you’ll be immediately notified when Word Sphynx 2.0 is AVAILABLE:

1) Is Word Sphynx simple enough for me to understand and buy into? 
In a word, YES.  Simply put, it’s a word puzzle app with a unique prize delivery system. Apple has already approved the prototype. It’s been copyrighted and trademarked.
2) Does Word Sphynx solve a problem or meet a need? 
Yes. It challenges the user to think creatively, and creates a friendly, competitive environment with a built in prize system. This allows the users to match their skills against thousands of others. The game is unique in two ways. 1 - it uses word clues to create word puzzle in a way that isn't being done anywhere else. 2 - it has a prize delivery system unlike anything on the App Store - you can win real rewards in the form of gift cards.
3) Is there a big enough market and customer base for Word Sphynx?
Yes.  The app content rating is 4+, which means it's available to all iPhone users young and old. The game caters to English speaking players, because the current word puzzles are in English. We are ready to react to demand and offer it in numerous languages.
4) Does Posse Creative have the right people on their team to pull it off?
Our current team includes the ""idea"" guy (Marc Jennings), a iOS developer, legal counsel and a marketing consultant. We've invested thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours into creating Word Sphynx. We've got skin in the game right now. 
5) Do development duties reside with one person, or is there a team in place? 
Initially, the puzzle making duties were handled by Marc Jennings. After realizing the potential danger in having the app “go dark” if new puzzles were not being created, Marc wrote a set of guidelines for puzzle making and shared it with family. Now puzzles are created by not just Marc, but by multiple family members and trusted friends. Believe it or not, the most creative puzzles have come from our kids and they continue to contribute weekly. After making an initial sweep through the entire dictionary to prove puzzles could be made long term, the database of puzzles currently holds near 1000 puzzles and we haven’t even made it out of the “A’s” in the dictionary. 1000 puzzles is about 1 year worth of content for Word Sphynx. 
6) Why did we choose to launch on iOS and follow up on Android, Facebook? 
The answer is in the statistics. According to recent data announced at the Apple WWDC (World Wide Developer's Conference), about 80% of all iOS users are using the latest OS platform while only about 5% (or less) of all Android users are running the latest OS version of that platform. What is the ""read"" here? iOS users appear to be more likely to adopt the latest software updates and download the latest app content. The Blackberry and Windows Mobile markets have shown consistent declines since 2010 and are trending downward. It is for that reason we have ruled out those markets in favor of the iOS and Android markets. The Facebook market may not be experiencing the exponential growth that it once was, but even as it begins to level out with 1 billion users (as of early Oct. 2012), we believe this will be a viable market for Word Sphynx outside of the mobile device customer base. The fact that nearly 40% of Facebook users are mobile app users provides an ideal opportunity for cross promotion.

<p>Inspired by famous literary characters, each Infamy mini is twisted to fit into a steampunk version of London in the late 19th Century.</p>
<p>This campaign started out as a way to get this somewhat psychotic version of Doctor John Watson (sculpted by ex-Rackham supremo <a href=""http://artmikh.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">MIKH</a> at 32mm scale) cast, but now the second stretch goal has been passed things change a bit.</p>

<p>A full production run on Watson is already covered, so thank you to everyone who has contributed.</p>
<p>Now I'm working towards other cool stuff. First up is Edwina Hyde and if contributions continue I'll be able to push her into production ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>I promised some previews of her if the second stretch goal was reached, so here she is.</p>

<p>You'll notice the material looks rather different to the Watson sculpt. That's because Hyde is a digital model, so she doesn't yet exist in a physical state.</p>
<p>Here's her concept art by Martin McKenna to give you a better idea of her final look.</p>

<p>I've created different perks depending on how much you'd like to contribute. From a print of Martin McKenna's cool concept art, all the way to getting your likeness on a future Infamy model, there is a geeky reward for all budgets! :D</p>
<p>Postage costs are included in all the perk totals (wherever you may be in the world) so you'll save yourself money on the combined retail and postage price Watson will cost in my webstore (£14.99 before postage).</p>

By eliminating the need to steer we can provide you, the player, with unparalleled freedom to focus on that which matters most: Enjoying the Intuitive speed, leaps, physics and puzzles that the game has to offer. As a backer you will be one of the first people to try out this exciting new approach to gaming, with the opportunity to become involved in, or brand this little bit of history with your name.  </p>

<p><b>Cinematic camera angles</b></p>
<p>Another unique feature of O3DX is our proprietary spline based camera system that allows the artist to place the camera in the perfect spot at exactly the right time, no matter how you decide to play the game. This creates the feeling that you are the star in a blockbuster movie, with cinematic camera positions that will immerse you in the dust or fly you over valleys and canyons.</p>

AAA visual fidelity:
Through harnessing the latest rendering technology and fine tuning resources to match your device, you are presented with immersive, realistic rides through breath-taking terrains of exquisite detail and class leading special effects.

Unlike any predecessor:
By rethinking and redesigning the way you interact with a vehicle, O3DX presents a whole new gaming experience.
Intuitive controls, maximum playability and camera angles that keep you in the thick of the action at the right moments. Ensuring a healthy dose of addictive adrenaline in what promises to become a whole new game genre. 
Smell the diesel, taste the dust! O3DX will be the new game you love..





Complete the level.


Overcoming obstacles is the focus of the fun; daring physics, brainteasers, speed and leaps will test your off road skills. Subsequent levels can only be unlocked by successfully finishing a level.



Beat the clock.

If that's it for you then continue to the next level, but if you're up for a titanic challenge you have to do it all over again, except that this time you have to beat the clock as well in order to unlock the second milestone of each level. 


Collect the stars.
Collect the stars as you go along in order to unlock future bonus levels. For each bonus level you need to have collected all the stars in the preceding levels. If you're really brave you will try to beat the clock while collecting all the stars. (Not for the feint hearted).



Much more:
- Easy controls.
- Ridiculously Realistic physics!
- Spectacular graphics!
- More level packs in development for non-stop entertainment.










Classic 4x4 vehicles, Military Off road Vehicles, Modern sporty all terrain vehicles and more.










and more..

New Genre
O3DX is not just a new game, it heralds the birth an entire new game genre. Welcome to the Self Steering Physics Obstacle Genre. By eliminating the need to steer we can provide you, the player, with unparalleled freedom to focus on that which matters most: Enjoying the Intuitive speed, leaps, physics and puzzles that the game has to offer. As a backer you will be one of the first people to try out this exciting new approach to gaming, with the opportunity to become involved in, or brand this little bit of history with your name.  


Cinematic camera angles
Another unique feature of O3DX is our proprietary spline based camera system that allows the artist to place the camera in the perfect spot at exactly the right time, no matter how you decide to play the game. This creates the feeling that you are the star in a blockbuster movie, with cinematic camera positions that will immerse you in the dust or fly you over valleys and canyons.



O3DX was built using Unity Pro Game Engine in combination with Grinder. 




Unity ProUnity is arguably the leading game engine around with a powerful rendering engine and class leading multi platform distribution. Unity contains the powerful 3D physics engine NVIDIA® PhysX® Physics. Expect immersive and visceral scenes with tires that screech and burn; walls that crumble and glass that shatters. We would not put our money behind any other game engine.GrinderGrinder is our in-house developed 4x4 engine that integrates with Unity and brings the 4x4 world to your screen. It was developed over the last 3 years undergoing 3 design iterations. Hundreds of thousands of downloads later, Grinder has matured into an off-road beast with no equivalent.  Smell the diesel...taste the dust! 





What do we aim to achieve with the Indiegogo campaign funding? 
The game is 95% complete and currently in the late alpha phase of the development cycle. We're almost there and we have a sufficient budget to complete the game. This Indiegogo campaign has been created with you in mind. We want to offer enthusiastic individuals the opportunity to get involved and create a pre-launch community around this exciting game. We want to offer you the game on pre-order with perks only available to our backers. Have a look at the different backing opportunities and choose the option best suited to you. This is a once off opportunity. Once this campaign is over these perks will never be available again.




However, if we were to exceed our base goal then it would allow us to implement many of our stretch goals and improve the overall experience of the game. Our list of stretch goals:
$20 000

Old man Bob the mechanic. Old man Bob becomes the voice enabled mechanic character that will guide you, upgrade your engines and give all round advice to you as you progress through the levels. He is the mechanic that no 4x4 enthusiast can live without.
More game assets (trucks, terrain assets, etc).


$30k-$50,000

An additional level pack with 10 more levels!

Cross platform versions for Mac and PC and possibly Oculus Rift.
Even more game assets.







$50K-$100,000

Oculus Rift guaranteed.

Two additional level packs with 20 more levels!

Our love and appreciation.
Much more game assets.








$100 000+

Playstation + Xbox (Possibly WII)

Three additional level packs with 30 more levels!

Tons of additional game assets.

Our undying love and eternal appreciation!





Accountability
It is our commitment to you, our backers, that we will maintain consistent communication throughout the process. This means regular updates, product screenshots, and plenty of behind the scenes insight as we complete the creation of O3DX. After all, we built this game for you..

<div>Hello all!<br/>I'm Kalle Alanen a miniature gaming enthusiast from Finland. I have played miniature wargames for 14 years more or less actively and during this time I have tried my hand at modelling too. I decided one day to make resin bases for my Malifaux miniatures. After I made all the bases for my miniatures, I still had the moulds. And so I thought to myself, maybe I can make some more of the bases to sell to my friends, and if they like them, I'll try something bigger - to provide some income with my talents.</div>
<div>The campaign is basically me making bases and you paying me for them. I try to keep the prices low so anyone can get them yet get something out of my work.</div>
<div>Buy my bases, and you will see more different kinds of them in the future.</div>
<div>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/>
</div>
</div><div> <p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Due to Finnish laws, this is a pre-sale. You purchase the items and so you and I enter into a legal contract for you to pay me and I to deliver the items. So it doesn't matter if the goal is not reached - you will still get the items. I have to ask you to pay exact sums though.</span><br/></p>
<p>If you are interested enough, I will launch other campaigns and/or set up a webstore in future. You can offer ideas for the future base sets if you want to - I'll try to make those ideas a reality.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>You get nice looking bases while I get to make more designs. As I mentioned above, please leave ideas for what you would like to see in the future. I want to keep making different base styles and later on other bits and pieces as well, and you can help me get to the road.</div>
<div>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</span><br/>
</div>
</div><div>
<div>There are some challenges of course. The moulds will break, the moulding process might fail, the bases itself might not come out perfectly. All these are problems to be overcome.</div>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>If you can't or don't want to contibute, please tell your friends and ask them to do the same. There are the share tools to share this project on Indiegogo as well.</div>
</div><div><br/></div><div>Thanks for reading! </div><div><br/></div><div>
<h3>How to order?</h3>
<div>You need to choose what you would like to purchase. I have three different sized bases, 30mm, 40mm and 50mm. When you make the purchase, you pay for as many sets as you want, with basic sets being 3 euros and the collection with one set of each being 6 euros. So, if you want two sets of 30mm and one set of 40mm you would pay 7 euros + s&amp;h total. If you want only 2 sets of 50mm bases, you'd pay 6 euros + s&amp;h. For 20 sets (2 x 10 sets) you would pay 40 euros + s&amp;h.</div>
<div>I will be sending all purchasers a message after the campaign is over to check with you what you wish to get.</div>
</div><div><br/></div><div>
<h3>Shipping and Handling:</h3>
<div>If you want to pick the items up from my place, then S&amp;H is free. Otherwise, please keep reading.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>S&amp;H fees will depend on the amount of bases you want to order. The bases will be sent 2nd class mail using Itella Posti (Finnish Postal Service) packed in a bubble wrapped cardboard mailing box.</div>
<div>The S&amp;H prices are as follows</div>
<div><b>Pickup:</b></div>
<div>1-many sets: 0,00€</div>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hello all!I'm Kalle Alanen a miniature gaming enthusiast from Finland. I have played miniature wargames for 14 years more or less actively and during this time I have tried my hand at modelling too. I decided one day to make resin bases for my Malifaux miniatures. After I made all the bases for my miniatures, I still had the moulds. And so I thought to myself, maybe I can make some more of the bases to sell to my friends, and if they like them, I'll try something bigger - to provide some income with my talents.
The campaign is basically me making bases and you paying me for them. I try to keep the prices low so anyone can get them yet get something out of my work.
Buy my bases, and you will see more different kinds of them in the future.

What We Need & What You Get

 Due to Finnish laws, this is a pre-sale. You purchase the items and so you and I enter into a legal contract for you to pay me and I to deliver the items. So it doesn't matter if the goal is not reached - you will still get the items. I have to ask you to pay exact sums though.
If you are interested enough, I will launch other campaigns and/or set up a webstore in future. You can offer ideas for the future base sets if you want to - I'll try to make those ideas a reality.

  The Impact
You get nice looking bases while I get to make more designs. As I mentioned above, please leave ideas for what you would like to see in the future. I want to keep making different base styles and later on other bits and pieces as well, and you can help me get to the road.

Risks & Challenges


There are some challenges of course. The moulds will break, the moulding process might fail, the bases itself might not come out perfectly. All these are problems to be overcome.

  Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't or don't want to contibute, please tell your friends and ask them to do the same. There are the share tools to share this project on Indiegogo as well.
Thanks for reading! 
How to order?
You need to choose what you would like to purchase. I have three different sized bases, 30mm, 40mm and 50mm. When you make the purchase, you pay for as many sets as you want, with basic sets being 3 euros and the collection with one set of each being 6 euros. So, if you want two sets of 30mm and one set of 40mm you would pay 7 euros + s&h total. If you want only 2 sets of 50mm bases, you'd pay 6 euros + s&h. For 20 sets (2 x 10 sets) you would pay 40 euros + s&h.
I will be sending all purchasers a message after the campaign is over to check with you what you wish to get.

Shipping and Handling:
If you want to pick the items up from my place, then S&H is free. Otherwise, please keep reading.

S&H fees will depend on the amount of bases you want to order. The bases will be sent 2nd class mail using Itella Posti (Finnish Postal Service) packed in a bubble wrapped cardboard mailing box.
The S&H prices are as follows

1-many sets: 0,00€

1-3 sets: 2,40€4-12 sets: 3,00€13-29 sets: 4,80€30-58 sets: 6,60€59-116 sets: 10,20€European Region*:

I highly recommend Elementos. The game quality and game play are both phenomenal - a wonderful Kickstarter project to support.""
 Uwe Eickert, Academy Games
""Elementos is one of those rare games that combines a simple rules-set with layers of strategy. It can be very intense to play, yet can be taught in a matter of minutes. I highly enjoyed my plays of Elementos and I can see gamers enjoying it over and over again. Combined with a beautiful presentation, Elementos is a winning abstract strategy game that I'm sure will be loved by a wide variety of people!""  
 David Harding, Grail Games (creator of ""101 The card game"", ""Guns & Steel"")
HOT OFF THE PRESS - UNDEAD VIKING REVIEW

Words like ""surprising depth and tactics"", ""easy to learn"", ""cool elements"", ""feels good"", ""fun experience"", ""cool box"", ""play at work over lunch"", ""teach kids basic strategy"", ""really really enjoyed playing"" just keep echoing in our proud heads.
""Wood you like to play a unique new game? quite a revolutionary game, in which the basic elements face each other, and any move might be changed and reversed. Wooden, compact, neat game inspired by Rock-Paper-Scissors logic, in a fresh approach. Water, Wood and Fire are the elements in stake, light strategy will lead you across the board to win!""
Boaz Coster, partner and game designer, Theora Design (inventors of ""Guess who?"")


""Great-looking campaign! We featured it today on Casual Game Revolution""
 Chris James, founder, Casual Games Revolution (bringing positive change to the board game industry)
""Elementos - is a two player strategy game where players will each try and get their wand to their opponents side of the board. To do this ... It sounds cool and the wooden components (including the box that folds out to become the board) are very well done. Check it out.""
Kick the Table, Mike Minutillo, as reviewd in Board Game Geeks








We both believe in quality and strive to give you not only a superb game experience, but also deliver a top quality product. We decided to produce the game using silkscreened prints on wood to make it a portable game that will last. Game is ready to go, tested, and admired by plenty of game makers who saw it. 
Thanks! Enjoy!",17.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>We are currently planning Q1 2017.  We'd like to break even and secure funds to continue processing chips.  For reference, as of 2016-01-08 we've spent over $2500 of our own funds on chips already processed and in the pipeline.  This doesn't count the time we put into this project and also ignores equipment we already had.  Expenses include things like:</p>

<h3>The Fantasy Baseball Game that allows Players to Make Money!</h3>
<p>The PSX is a brand new leading edge Fantasy Sports game that allows players like you and me to make money by buying and selling virtual shares in professional sports leagues from around the world. This real money fantasy game will test your ability to analyze sports team match-ups and try to predict which team will be in line to receive dividends during the regular and post season.</p>
<p>There will be numerous opportunities to increase the value of your portfolio through your trading skills or through the Dividend prizes that are awarded throughout the season. Which ever way you make a profit, we guarantee you will have more fun and be more involved than any fantasy sports game you have ever played.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have been developing this game quietly for a period of time using our own money and also from our friends and family but the time has come to launch this extraordinary game in time for the upcoming Major League Baseball season. We have run into an impasse in trying to raise money through the Venture Capital and Angel route for the money needed to finish the programming and marketing.</p>
<p>Since the PSX fantasy game involves the trading of Virtual shares, we will credit your account to build your own portfolio with a 20 times return on your pledge.</p>
<p>If you pledge $20.00, we will credit your account with $400.00 worth of credits to purchase any virtual team shares from the Virtual IPO which will take place prior to the start of the MLB season and remain in effect until the end of the first month of play. At this time, the Virtual IPO will close and trading will begin. Based on a team’s performance and other fundamentals relating to sports, prices will change.</p>
<p>Teams that didn’t perform well last year might start at a price of $0.10 but in this new season their worth could go through the roof in turn making you money!</p>
<p>The funds collected here will be used to bring this exciting product to the market. It has been in production for a few years and now we just need to develop it for the new platforms (web, mobile devices).</p>
<h3>Why The ProSports Exchange?</h3>
<p>Traditionally, the fantasy sports games have all been based on players and not teams. The PSX focuses on the teams giving players a long term playing platform that eventually can spread over many different leagues (NFL, NHL, NBA, EPL etc.).</p>

Ray Easterling, a safety for the Atlanta Falcons in the 1970s and a plaintiff in a high-profile lawsuit against the N.F.L. over its handling of concussion-related injuries, died on April 19 of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. In February 2011, the former Chicago Bears star Dave Duerson shot himself in the chest, <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/20/sports/football/20duerson.html"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">saying in a note</a> that he wanted his brain donated to the study of <a href=""http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/f/football/head_injuries/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"" title=""More articles about the head injuries in football."">football head injuries</a>. THIS HAS GOT TO STOP!  We want to shoot this documentary, ""A Head Of The Game"", to educate America on the dangers of concussions via the NFL athletes that suffer from them every day.  We will hear from expert neurolgist's like Dr. Daniel Amen who is doing the largest study on CTE, and chronic brain disorders in NFL athletes. We also plan to donate a significant amount of money for research for ongoing studies that relate to all athletes and chronic brain injuries. This is a serious issue and I intend to showcase the severe issues past NFL players are having from chronic brain injuries.  Again, will be donating a portion of the funds collected to Dr. Daniel Amen's research project with NFL athletes and chronic concussions. </p>
<p><strong>WHY WE ARE DOING IT</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sports Girls LLC</strong> is a new company designed to educate america on sports via the athletes, coaches, and trainers that do it on a daily basis.  Our goal is to spend time with athletes, on and off the field and educate America on the game itself, the good, bad, and the ugly.  We decided to take a chance.  We are a young company that is trying to do the right thing.  The NFL is not helping some of these retired athletes like Brent Boyd, Rayfield Wright, and many more that you will hear from in this documentary.   These men are suffering on a daily basis.  They are not getting million dollar checks, nor did they ever!  Some NFL retired athletes cannot even get medical coverage from the NFL, and we are taLking about NFL athletes!  This is an incredible story that can only be told by the players that have lived it.  It will open up the eyes of many Americans, and we cannot let another athlete die.  There is help, and hope out there and we are going to show other athletes, moms, teachers, high school football players, dads, lawyers, children, college and even NFL athletes what really happened to these NFL players.  Concussions are a serious condition, and we are going to show you the medical proof!  We will even give Roger Goodell, and the NFL a chance to let America know what positive improvements and methodlogies are being put into place for current NFL athletes.  We will see if the NFL responds.  WE need your help.  Check out Dignity After Football on Face Book as Well.</p>
<p><strong>WHO IS UP STREAM MEDIA?~</strong></p>
<p>Up-Stream Media, Inc. is a multi-generational family of video and  musical professionals. We are also sports fans as are so many others.Members of our team have participated in over  40 award winning productions (including four Emmy nominated pieces) but never  one with such a complicated subject matter.As a full service HD production company who primarily produces television  and radio commercials, we are extremely aware of the market value of popular  athletes.We weren’t aware however, of  the probable cause for the decline of so many ex-pro football players until the Sport’s Girls asked us to come on board this project.  They shot our PSA for this fund raiser.</p>
<p>Up-Stream Media considers it an honor and privilege to participate  in the A-Head of the Game Documentary.As players become faster, stronger and more skilled there is no better  time than now, to aid those who have suffered such horrific repercussions  because of their commitments to greatness.Perhaps by becoming aware of the plight of past generations of football  players, we can not only help them, but present and future players as well.</p>
<p>We also will be using other media partners such as <a href=""http://starlingproductions.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">starlingproductions.com</a> with their permission.  We also may use various production companies as needed to get this documentary shot.</p>
<p>We may use footage and other production needs from cantonfilms.com. </p>
<p><strong>~~FAQ~~</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHAT HAPPENS IF THE MONEY ISN'T RAISED IN TIME?~  We will use your funding</strong>.  If our production goal ($25,000) isn't met before the deadline we will have to make some changes to the production but the documentary <strong>should</strong> get made in some form.  The worst case scenario would be we would donate ALL the raised money (minus Indiegogo fees and cost of campaign) to Dr. Daniel Amen's research or any related NON PROFIT CAUSE on this issue.  The athletes involved will be very disappointed if we don't meet our goal. WE CANNOT LET THIS HAPPEN..  PLEASE HELP US.  We want to really show you what the NFL athletes are going through, and give the NFL a chance to let you know what improvements are being made.  We need to reach the goal, but will try to make this no matter what.  If we hit the $25K goal we can make this documentary happen.</p>
<p><strong>CAN I INCREASE MY PLEDGE ONCE IT'S BEEN MADE?~  YES!!</strong> Once you donate to a campaign, you may want to change your incentive reward to a different one, or increase your pledge amount.  To do so, go to Indiegogo and sign in.  If you go to our campaign page, you can select your new donation package.   Please click it and you can enter a new amount, or choose a new incentive. </p>
<p><strong>CAN WE EXCEED THE GOAL?~</strong>  <strong>YES!!</strong>  That would be amazing as we are not a 501 (c)(3)  corporation, but want to help players suffering with CTE. We will not be able to shoot this documentary without your support.  All money will be used to produce this much needed documentary. However, as stated earlier we will DONATE all extra funds raised to Dr. Daniel Amen and possibly one other concussion awareness study for non profit.   </p>
<p><strong>WHEN IS THE VIEWING PARTY?~</strong>  We cannot schedule the party until we have shot and edited the entire documentary.  We will first have to raise all of the funds in order to make that happen.  The viewing party will be prior to the documentary airing to the public and we will let you know way in advance.</p>
<p><strong>HOW DO WE CONTACT YOU?~</strong>  So happy you asked me that.  Please send all inquiries to <a href=""http://mailto:thesportsgirls@aol.com/"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">thesportsgirls@aol.com</a>.  We will get back to you within one week. </p>
<p><strong>IF I DONATE, WHEN CAN I REDEEM THE INCENTIVE?~</strong> All incentives big and small, will only happen if our goal is met.  If we do meet our goal, immediately after our deadline will will start to manufacture and ship all physical merchandise directly to you.  It will be our priority to schedule the more personal incentives as soon as possible.  You will be hearing from our Team.<strong>  WE NEED TO MAKE OUR GOAL!</strong></p>
<p><strong>WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?~</strong>  Every penny (minus the fees for Indiegogo's involvement) will go directly to The Sports Girls LLC, Owner and Creator of A Head Of The Game to produce this documentary!!  Your money goes directly to the funding of this documentary.  We cannot do it without YOU!  ANY MONEY RAISED ABOVE OUR GOAL WILL BE DONATED TO NON PROFIT RESEARCH!</p>
<p>Please e-mail us with any other questions.  Please tell every person you know about this project!  We want to help save lives and show America the truth about concussions and the NFL.  We will also try and get an official statement from the NFL or NFLPA on this imperative issue.</p>

WHO IS UP STREAM MEDIA?~
Up-Stream Media, Inc. is a multi-generational family of video and  musical professionals. We are also sports fans as are so many others.Members of our team have participated in over  40 award winning productions (including four Emmy nominated pieces) but never  one with such a complicated subject matter.As a full service HD production company who primarily produces television  and radio commercials, we are extremely aware of the market value of popular  athletes.We weren’t aware however, of  the probable cause for the decline of so many ex-pro football players until the Sport’s Girls asked us to come on board this project.  They shot our PSA for this fund raiser.
Up-Stream Media considers it an honor and privilege to participate  in the A-Head of the Game Documentary.As players become faster, stronger and more skilled there is no better  time than now, to aid those who have suffered such horrific repercussions  because of their commitments to greatness.Perhaps by becoming aware of the plight of past generations of football  players, we can not only help them, but present and future players as well.
We also will be using other media partners such as starlingproductions.com with their permission.  We also may use various production companies as needed to get this documentary shot.
We may use footage and other production needs from cantonfilms.com. 
~~FAQ~~
WHAT HAPPENS IF THE MONEY ISN'T RAISED IN TIME?~  We will use your funding.  If our production goal ($25,000) isn't met before the deadline we will have to make some changes to the production but the documentary should get made in some form.  The worst case scenario would be we would donate ALL the raised money (minus Indiegogo fees and cost of campaign) to Dr. Daniel Amen's research or any related NON PROFIT CAUSE on this issue.  The athletes involved will be very disappointed if we don't meet our goal. WE CANNOT LET THIS HAPPEN..  PLEASE HELP US.  We want to really show you what the NFL athletes are going through, and give the NFL a chance to let you know what improvements are being made.  We need to reach the goal, but will try to make this no matter what.  If we hit the $25K goal we can make this documentary happen.
CAN I INCREASE MY PLEDGE ONCE IT'S BEEN MADE?~  YES!! Once you donate to a campaign, you may want to change your incentive reward to a different one, or increase your pledge amount.  To do so, go to Indiegogo and sign in.  If you go to our campaign page, you can select your new donation package.   Please click it and you can enter a new amount, or choose a new incentive. 
CAN WE EXCEED THE GOAL?~  YES!!  That would be amazing as we are not a 501 (c)(3)  corporation, but want to help players suffering with CTE. We will not be able to shoot this documentary without your support.  All money will be used to produce this much needed documentary. However, as stated earlier we will DONATE all extra funds raised to Dr. Daniel Amen and possibly one other concussion awareness study for non profit.   
WHEN IS THE VIEWING PARTY?~  We cannot schedule the party until we have shot and edited the entire documentary.  We will first have to raise all of the funds in order to make that happen.  The viewing party will be prior to the documentary airing to the public and we will let you know way in advance.
HOW DO WE CONTACT YOU?~  So happy you asked me that.  Please send all inquiries to thesportsgirls@aol.com.  We will get back to you within one week. 
IF I DONATE, WHEN CAN I REDEEM THE INCENTIVE?~ All incentives big and small, will only happen if our goal is met.  If we do meet our goal, immediately after our deadline will will start to manufacture and ship all physical merchandise directly to you.  It will be our priority to schedule the more personal incentives as soon as possible.  You will be hearing from our Team.  WE NEED TO MAKE OUR GOAL!
WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO?~  Every penny (minus the fees for Indiegogo's involvement) will go directly to The Sports Girls LLC, Owner and Creator of A Head Of The Game to produce this documentary!!  Your money goes directly to the funding of this documentary.  We cannot do it without YOU!  ANY MONEY RAISED ABOVE OUR GOAL WILL BE DONATED TO NON PROFIT RESEARCH!
Please e-mail us with any other questions.  Please tell every person you know about this project!  We want to help save lives and show America the truth about concussions and the NFL.  We will also try and get an official statement from the NFL or NFLPA on this imperative issue.

<p>SCAMS, ISSUES, DEVELOPMENT, CORRUPTION, PAY PER VOTE, BOGUS VOTING and everything that real politics have!</p>
<p>'Politics of India' is a pure strategy based board game with unique but easy to understand game play. 'Politics of India' simulates the Parliament elections of India and gives you a chance to become the best political party in India and make government. Either you can fight for election on the issues like 'Development', 'Women safety' etc. or you can play dirty politics and use unethical methods such as 'booth capturing', 'bogus voting' or 'bahubali' and try to win maximum number of seats. But when you are using unethical resources, be aware of 'election commision raid' during voting otherwise your candidate will be disqualified.</p>
<p>It's a game which you can play with friends, family and even with children.</p>
<p>Game play duration can be as short as 30-45 minutes or can be increased for power users. It's not a just roll-the-dice , but a pure strategy game, with lots of twist and tricks.</p>
<p>If you have loved games such as Monopoly, Power grid or likes, you are certainly going to love 'Politics of India'.</p>
<p>Our target is to ship at least 100 game pieces in the first installment. We also want to keep the price reasonable, such that average Indian can buy and enjoy the game. Some of the games today available in the market are so costly that even we have to think twice before buying.</p>

<p>You won't have access to weapons or be able to freely shoot at enemies. Instead, you will have to <b>explore the uses of your handy laser racket</b> to send enemies bullets flying straight back at them. But be careful, for some bullets can't be striked back!<br/>However, if you manage to master your tennis skils, you will be able to turn a ball into a deadly sphere of ominous destruction to lay waste to everything in sight. </p>

<p>We are aware that game development is always a risky business. From team members getting sick, to insane game-breaking bugs, all sorts of problems may happen when you're making a game. <b>Our time planning always has a percentage of extra hours, considering potential problems and bug solving</b> that will be a part of the process. We have already taken into consideration the prices of producing the rewards, so don't worry about that. </p>
<p>What matters the most is that our team is formed by very dedicated professionals who will stop at nothing to see this game done in the best way possible. So rest assured that <b>the more</b> <b>backers help us, the better the game will be. It's all up to you! </b></p>

Help Racketboy save his planet from a horde of cute-yet-deadly foes who will stop at nothing to bring pain and suffering to our hero's homeland. We built a very fun concept in 72 hours for a game development competition. Now we want to create the full version with your help! Here's what we are planning:
6 Insane Worlds with 2 different Acts each
30 kinds of enemies
6 Powerful Mini-bosses
15 Epic Bosses
6 Power-ups
6 Buddies Species
6 Ball Powers to choose from

Awesome retro art style, inspired by the great cute'em ups from the past

Procedurally generated enemy waves and random bosses to assure that no playthrough is the same as the one before

Endless Mode to challenge your limits! 

Leaderboards for you to compete with the world and conquer the top with the best racketing skills!





Platforms
With Unity3D, we plan to launch the game initially for Windows, Mac and Linux. If the campaign is funded, we'll check the possibility of making the game available for mobile devices as well.
Estimated launch : Mid 2016





 
After some heavy brainstorming, mechanics experiments, and a whole lot of dying while playing insane arcade shooters, we developed a combination of two classic genres to create a completely unique experience. Racketboy will challenge you in a new and exciting way.



You won't have access to weapons or be able to freely shoot at enemies. Instead, you will have to explore the uses of your handy laser racket to send enemies bullets flying straight back at them. But be careful, for some bullets can't be striked back!However, if you manage to master your tennis skils, you will be able to turn a ball into a deadly sphere of ominous destruction to lay waste to everything in sight. 
  



 
Despite our different approach to the genre, we want fans of the good old shoot'em up games to feel encouraged to compete for high scores and perfect runs in our game.
That's why we will make our best efforts to bring a worthy challenge to hardcore fans, rewarding them for achieving a perfect run through a game or a perfect boss battle, and many other skill related achievements.


There will also be leaderboards to house the all-time best players, so get ready for some really tough competition!And if you want to test your endurance, the Endless Mode will also be available, taking you into an intense challenge that forces you to face everything you already unlocked in the game for as long as you can go.

 



 
We are developing a lot of tools to provide you with tons of power and to allow for many different strategies. There are many ideas still being discussed and developed, but we'll be listing some features you can already expect to see !
Power-ups
You will count on a variety of different power-ups to help out on your fierce battles. They will provide special advantages to turn the tides in your favor. 
Big Racket      Projection  Racket
Power RacketForce Field Racket
Sticky Racket
 Payback ScarfShield Scarf
Speedy Scarf    Teleport Scarf 
 
Buddies
Tiny satellite allies that assist you with some very special skills! Buddies come in all shapes and types, complementing your play style with all sorts of abilities.




Balls
Racketboy has the ability to charge his strikes to the point where a shot transform into a much more powerful one. And the player will have quite some options of final forms he can choose from his super shot. 
Growing BallHoming Ball
 Laser BallPiercing Ball
Power BallShatter Ball
Stun Ball
 




The universe is filled with cute, cuddly, friendly-looking faces... and they’re all out to destroy you and everything you love! You will be facing the cutest and most vile creatures in the universe, all armed with intense bullet hell patterns and destructive-yet-vulnerable balls of destruction. You will also encounter many different approaches to the classic block breaker patterns, all designed to enhance Racketboy’s unique sense of challenge. 

 



 
 






No shooter is complete without gigantic bosses with overwhelming bullet patterns, and rest assured you will encounter as many as you can fight ! Each level will have a single boss waiting for you in the end, and new bosses can be unlocked through achievements, increasing the roster more and more. Minibosses are there to make it even more challenging, trying to beat you at your own game of space tennis, using every dirty strategy they can to completely destroy you.

We created the prototype using Construct 2, a very simple game making engine, in a 72 hours competition. Therefore, a lot of mistakes were made and almost no optimization due to time constraints. We are re-building the whole game on Unity3D with a much more stable and organized build, which means we are creating the game from scratch!
We all love our work very much, and dedicate as much of our time as possible to Double Dash's projects to ensure a game that every one of us would love to play.
Sadly, we all have work to make money while we don't complete the game. That reduces drastically the amount of time we can put into the creation of Racketboy.
We want to be able to work 100% of our time on Racketboy, and that's why we need your help. Every dollar invested on this project will be dedicated to covering development costs, fees and other expenses, as well as making sure that you receive quality rewards.
                              
This amount also covers the fact that a big chunk of that money is lost to taxes, sadly. 

Double Dash is an indie developer studio from Brazil, formed by 5 talented members that are completely passionate about retro gaming and simple fun. The team focus their efforts in creating intense challenges through different approaches, trying to explore well-known mechanics in original and unseen manners.

We are aware that game development is always a risky business. From team members getting sick, to insane game-breaking bugs, all sorts of problems may happen when you're making a game. Our time planning always has a percentage of extra hours, considering potential problems and bug solving that will be a part of the process. We have already taken into consideration the prices of producing the rewards, so don't worry about that. 
What matters the most is that our team is formed by very dedicated professionals who will stop at nothing to see this game done in the best way possible. So rest assured that the more backers help us, the better the game will be. It's all up to you!

</div><div></div></div>","Artipia Games is proud to present Briefcase. It is a new and exciting game by two Greek designers, Sotiris Tsantilas and Nikolas Sakaloglou. In a game of Briefcase, two to four players take over the role of young entrepreneurs aiming for wealth and success. By acquiring and activating various companies, players strive for financial supremacy.








Our main goal is to raise $10,000. We have a busy and ambitious production schedule for 2012 and your contributions will help us bring this game to life.






The English version of the Briefcase rulebook can be downloaded by clicking on the link below:
www.artipiagames.com/briefcase/rules/Briefcase_ENG_Rulebook.pdf
The game is language independent and several languages will be available online.








Inside the box you will find:



Rulebook (English, German, French rules with more languages available online)


96 Company cards (large square 8x8cm)


30 Company Randomizer cards (large square 8x8cm)

48 Buy Decision cards (standard euro 5.9x9.1cm)

36 Activate Decision cards (standard euro 5.9x9.1cm) 


45 Obstacle Decision cards
(standard euro 5.9x9.1cm)


16 Hire Decision cards
(standard euro 5.9x9.1cm)

24 Personnel Resource cards (4.35x6.75cm) 
20 Steel Resource cards (4.35x6.75cm)  
20 Concrete Resource cards (4.35x6.75cm)  
20 Paper Resource cards  (4.35x6.75cm)  
20 Imported Resource cards  (4.35x6.75cm)  

20 Energy Resource cards  (4.35x6.75cm)  

2 Resource Block cards  (4.35x6.75cm) 
1 Company Block card  (4.35x6.75cm)
20 Victory Point cards  (4.35x6.75cm)  
1 Central Bank Board 
(23x11cm) 









Briefcase uses a combination of deck building and resource management mechanisms producing an interesting and unique result. 

Each player begins the game with the same Decision cards which form the Decision Deck. Each turn a player draws 4 cards from his deck and uses the cards to acquire and activate companies. During his turn a player can also purchase resources from the resource market in order to pay for the activation costs of his companies. Whenever player activates a company he collects its production and adds it to his Decision Deck.



Company Cards

Steel Factory Company card.

On the top of each company card is the buying cost, status, title and victory point value.
On the bottom is the activation cost, the ability and the production.

The Steel Factory is one of the 30 different companies included in the game. The artwork of the game is done by Antonis Papantoniou, illustrator of Drum Roll. It is still under development. Several company cards in the rulebook are not ready yet. They are currently being created and should appear as updates as our campaign progresses.

Decision Cards




The deck building mechanism evolves around four different decision cards. Those are:

Buy: allows the player to acquire new companies, resource and can also be converted to victory points through the central bank.

Activate: allows the player to activate his companies and produce more decision cards to enrich his deck with.

Hire: allows the player to temporarily use another player's company card by paying him half the production cost.

Obstacles: does nothing but through various company cards becomes a very useful card.


 Decision Card Back



Resource Cards 



After acquiring companies, a player needs to activate them in order to produce more decision cards for his deck and score their victory points when the game ends. Each company consumes resources and has a production cost the player must pay each time he wants to activate it. There are 5 basic resources. Personnel, Concrete, Steel, Paper and Energy. A player can purchase the first 4 from the Resource Market in order to activate companies. Energy can only be produced from the Power Plant which is the company each player begins the game with. After one of the resources is exhausted, a sixth resource enters the market, the Imported resource. They can be used as any basic resource but cost double to buy.















Briefcase is language independent. Everything is described through symbols.

<p>Equals is a strategic card game for 2-6 players that can also be used to help teach younger players mathematical skills. I have personally tested this with my own 6 year old who loves playing it!</p>
<p>Players take turns playing cards from their hands in an attempt to make the value of both sides of the playing field equal. Each time the sides are equaled the player receives points.</p>
<p>The first player to the designated point value wins the game!</p>
<p>I am currently waiting for my first proof of the game from the manufacturer and will update this campaign with pictures and more video when I receive it.</p>
<p>The game will retail for $14.99 plus s/h once the first production run has been made.</p>

Equals is a strategic card game for 2-6 players that can also be used to help teach younger players mathematical skills. I have personally tested this with my own 6 year old who loves playing it!
Players take turns playing cards from their hands in an attempt to make the value of both sides of the playing field equal. Each time the sides are equaled the player receives points.
The first player to the designated point value wins the game!
I am currently waiting for my first proof of the game from the manufacturer and will update this campaign with pictures and more video when I receive it.
The game will retail for $14.99 plus s/h once the first production run has been made.
About Me:
I LOVE games, especially board games and card games. I love games so much that I've decided to try my hand at designing them.
I have lots of other game ideas and I look forward to getting these games into homes all across the U.S. starting with this project.
About the Campaign:
My goal with this campaign is to be able to make my first production run of 100 units.
$2000 will allow me to purchase all 100 production units as well as provide all perks, including shipping.
Thanks in advance for your contribution. Let's bring back family game night!

Local governments, state governments, the U.S. Federal Government and many international governments are all facing budget shortfalls, spending cuts and reduced services. All of us -- ordinary citizens, elected officials, civic and community leaders -- know that we must make dramatic changes and tough choices to solve this crisis. But how do we engage our communities in identifying and prioritizing the best possible solutions? How do we create more engaged and informed citizens?

Our Answer?  Fix Broke(n) Governments through Serious Games
On January 29, 2011, The Innovation Games® Company designed and produced an in-person serious game to help more than 100 citizens, community leaders and city officials in San Jose, CA collaboratively prioritize possible cuts to the city budget. 
Instead of polling residents individually, our specially designed Innovation Game®, the San Jose Budget Games, created an opportunity for ordinary citizens to negotiate with one another, listen to their neighbors and create budgets that reflected not only their own but others viewpoints. Civic leaders left the San Jose Budget Games with both a clear and actionable list of the proposals citizens could compromise on and also a record of why they had found common ground—and the game results have impacted the actual city budget.  
Our experience with the city of San Jose has convinced us that games are a powerful tool for civic engagement: Thus we’re seeking funds to extend our existing in-person version of Budget Games into an online version.  Instead of engaging hundreds of citizens, we want to powerfully connect tens of thousands or even millions of motivated citizens with their elected officials—and we need your help to get this done.
Democrat, Republican, or Libertarian?

We think asking people about their political affiliation before engaging in real discourse about complex topics is not helping us develop the solutions that we need to solve problems. Decades of research in cognitive psychology and organizational behavior have shown us that the optimal group size for collaborative problem solving is between 5 and 8 people. So, we've optimized our in-person and online games for that number. And guess what? When you have a small number of people playing our games, they don't hardly ever ask if their fellow players are Democrats or Republicans or Libertarians or whatever other political party they might fancy. Instead, they work together as citizens. And citizenry is more important than political party. 







We also want to stress that we're not trying to change the structure of our government. We believe in representational democracy. What we seek is increased civic engagement. What We Need to Bring Budget Games To Your Community!We at Innovation Games have already committed many resources to Budget Games. We have assembled a team of developers who are ready and waiting to help us put Budget Games online and hired a summer intern who has already started working on our outreach program.  We have also trained more than 400 facilitators in cities across the U.S. and around the world, and attracted that interest of several major corporations willing to provide hosting and analytic services to help cities hosting games take action against the results.
While we have built a solid foundation, we need your help to bring Budget Games to the next level!  Here is how your funds will be spent: 


Building an online version of Budget Games produced for San Jose. We'll extend our current virtual market game, Buy a Feature Online to accommodate Government’s special needs, like allowing people to bid on both funding and cutting budget items and restricting enrollment to a set geographic area (i.e. city limits). Note that this approach reduces a tremendous amount of risk. We're not starting from scratch!  


Playing Budget Games in more communities.  We will recruit enough people to play 3,000 to 5,000 online budget games (since each game is based on roughly 8 people, that's somewhere between 24,000 to 40,000 citizens of a major U.S. city). Three cities that have expressed interest in participating in this project, including San Jose, CA, Lafayette, LA, and Portland, OR.

Making you a part of the development process!  The most important goal of the Budget Games is to create a more engaged civil society and so we will keep our IndieGoGo community updated with regular postings, videos of new Budget Games, videos and blog posts of other civic games, and we'll respond to your feedback as we progress.  

What Happens if We Raise More Than $25K! 
Any funds raised in excess of $25,000 will be used to further “gamify” Budget Games to promote extended civic engagement. For example, the creation of a ""citizen leaderboard"", made up of ""citizen levels"" to allow citizens who play multiple games to ""level up"" and play games of ""increasing difficulty"" with other players.
Other cool ideas we have for your money are: 


Make coordination of game facilitators much easier when managing extremely large numbers of players and games.

Provide our Innovation Games® training for free or at cost to civic and community leaders; we want to help you change your community for the better.
Provide enhanced facilities to manage and protect identity so that citizens can explore very sensitive topics.

Internationalize the Budget Games (Buy a Feature), so that citizens around the world can use our online virtual market games to tackle similar issues in their communities.


Integrate our system into Facebook to make it easier to play games to promote civic engagement.

Closing: Our Pitch in 60 Seconds or Less 
Why Are You Doing This?

Participation in government is declining and that’s not good. 
Elected officials need to understand our preferences so that they can make the tough choices necessary to resolve our budget crises.

Citizens need to work together. Our games promote thoughtful engagement over simplistic adherence to a party.


The hard problems we’re facing can only be solved through engaged dialog and debate.


Ultimately, a lack of broad participation means that we simply won’t realize the benefits of a representational democracy: Too small of a set of citizens will wield a disproportionate influence over the political process.
Why Should I Get Involved? 
We believe that Innovation Games and other serious games can help solve the problem of citizen engagement. Our experiences with the San Jose, CA, City Budget Games confirm this idea. And taking this online will enable massive engagement.  
Finally and most importantly games are fun!  When was the last time you had a chance to change the world and have a heck of a good time doing it? E.B. White would be proud of your donation!
Want Even More Information on Innovation Games® and Civic Engagement? 



Check out our the Innovation Games® website for our collection of in-person and online games and more information on the private sectors businesses like Qualcomm, Reed Elsevier, Cisco, Vendavo, Armstrong Flooring and Emerson Climate Technologies that have used our games collaborate with internal and external stakeholders to solve a variety of complex problems. 
For more information on the work we have done over the years to support many nonprofit and government agencies see:

Attack Poverty Project with Grameen America and PDMA : In this video, Katherine Rosenberg of Grameen America gives us her initial impressions of the Attack Poverty games.

Pro-Bono Work by our Globally Trained Network of Facilitators:  Over the years, we've helped churches and other faith-based communities, the Agile Alliance, the Scrum Alliance, the Agile Product Leadership Network and the Project Management Institute, to name a few.

We have a proven record of using serious games to solve complex problems. Our unique approach is such that the same game design can be used with both in-person and online populations. But we need your help to bring these tools to the global community.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Alex Richmond and I’m the lead designer at ZAMA Game Design. While I love creating and designing (and of course, playing) board games, I’m also a high school history teacher in upstate New York.</p>
<p>For the last several years, I’ve been working to create games and historical simulations that are fun, engaging, and have a strong educational value. I’ve designed countless games for my students and my classes, but now I’ve begun to create games that I hope to share with a much greater audience.</p>
<p>And that’s what Swords and Heroes is all about.</p>
<p><strong><img alt=""What is Swords and Heroes?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.zamagamedesign.com/IGG/HEAD_WhatisSwordsandHeroes.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></strong></p>
<p>Swords and Heroes is my first attempt at designing a game with a broader audience in mind. It’s a two-player tactical board game, based on some of history’s greatest classical civilizations.</p>
<p>In Swords and Heroes, players will be able to choose their civilization, build their army, and then lead that army into battle. Gameplay can be severely altered by the actions of your general, and each culture carries with it a variety of different advantages based on the history of those people.</p>
<p>The rules are simple and easy-to-learn, but the experience is complicated and diverse enough to keep even the most seasoned gamers interested.</p>
<p><strong><img alt=""Swords and Heroes Game Board"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.zamagamedesign.com/IGG/Board.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt=""What are we trying to do?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.zamagamedesign.com/IGG/HEAD_Whatarewetryingtodo.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></strong></p>
<p>The problem with many of the games that are similar to Swords and Heroes is the overall cost. Similar tactical table-top games are made incredibly expensive by intricate miniatures or are burdened by overly-complicated rules. We’re hoping to produce a game that’s simple and easy-to-learn, but is – more importantly – cheap and accessible.</p>
<p>We want to create something with the convenience of a card game but with the complexity of a full-scale tabletop game.</p>
<p>Thus far, we’ve been working with a great print-on-demand company, but in order to drive costs down to retail values, we need to print our product on a larger scale. This is certainly a major and expensive undertaking, and we’re going to need help – your help.</p>
<p><strong><img alt=""How can you help?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.zamagamedesign.com/IGG/HEAD_Howcanyouhelp.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></strong></p>
<p>We’re looking for eager participants to help generate the money that we need to make this happen. While we plan on first releasing our “<strong>STARTER SET</strong>,” we’d like to consider adding expansion packs that offer new, additional armies to compete with. We’ve got big goals for Swords and Heroes, but as it’s said, every journey begins with a single step.</p>
<p>We’re looking to raise <strong>$20,000</strong> to print and distribute our product outright. We’ve already begun small-scale distribution, but we’d like to further expand our market and drive our cost down considerably. To do this, we’ll need a good chunk of change, and we hope that you’ll join us in raising it.</p>
<p><strong><img alt=""Where does the money go?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.zamagamedesign.com/IGG/HEAD_Wheredoesthemoneygo.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></strong></p>
<p>The vast majority of the money goes directly to the printing costs associated with creating the game. Whenever you’re producing an item like this, cost for the consumer will always drop based on the publisher’s quantity. This method isn’t cheap for the publisher, but it’s the most effective way. Additional funds will go toward our marketing and distribution. We’ve already been promoting the game through local game stores and online venues, and we’d like to see this continue to grow.</p>
<p>In our initial prototyping of the game, we partnered with the incredibly talented <strong><a href=""http://www.benlinalexander.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Benlin Alexander</a></strong>, who designed the beautiful artwork you see on our box-top and many of our promotional items. The final piece of the funds we hope to raise will go to Benlin so that he can make Swords and Heroes look even more amazing – not only the box but what’s within it as well.</p>
<p>$20,000 is a lofty goal, and we realize that. In the event that we don't reach this mark, that money will still be collected and will still go towards developing Swords and Heroes -- albeit on a smaller scale. We'll continue to use the services of our print-on-demand company and use the money from this campaign to drive down retail prices as far as we can.</p>
<p><strong><img alt=""What do you get?"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.zamagamedesign.com/IGG/HEAD_Whatdoyouget.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></strong></p>
<p>In addition to our undying appreciation, there’s plenty that we’d like to offer you as a ‘thank-you’ for your support. Most donations over $50 will earn you one of the pre-release copies of the game itself but we’re also looking to give away some of our eye-catching posters and awesome t-shirts (sporting the insignia of either the Romans or the Germanic Tribes… your choice!).</p>
<p>Best of all, this fundraising campaign is one of the few places where you’ll be able to get a hold of our limited edition expansion pack: <strong>THE WARRIORS OF SPARTA!</strong> This is a rare opportunity to take control of the battlefield with some of the most legendary warriors in all of history. This expansion will never hit stores and will never be available online, but we’re going to offer it up to you as a thank-you for our generous support of our campaign.</p>

I always try to listen to the people who join my server so if any suggestions are given I always try to look into them and see if there is a viable option!</h3>
<h3>If you are at this web page because you would like to donate to the server, i want you to know how awesome you are. Obviously you will recieve perks based off of how much $ you pay! Im still working on what you get for each level of $ you pay, so any suggestions will be more then welcomed!</h3>
<h3>All the money that is given will either go straight back into the server or given to admins. Due to this any money that is given wont be refundable unless you send me a msg and we can work something out due to the fact that the money will most likely be spent instantly.. lol.</h3>
<h3>I hope everyone has an awesome time on the server!</h3>

<h3>Keep in mind, while rage is going to happen, please try to keep it to a minimum! Would be much appreciated and would save a lot of work for the admins!</h3>
