</div><p>Dear Fellow Cooperators, Allies and interested others,</p>
<p>Please consider helping CO-SOUND with our project of building our
exchange with the Cecosesola cooperative of Venezuela. We hope to bring 4
members of Cecosesola to the South Sound region of Washington State in October
2015 and send 4 representatives from different local coops to Venezuela in
February 2016. This will be our second exchange with Cecosesola. We are setting our goal at $6000 which will pay for airfare, costs associated with
getting a visa, and partial living expenses for 3 of the 4 companeros.  The
rest of the funds will come from other organizations participating in the exchange such as:
The Evergreen State College, The Olympia Food Coop, The New Moon Cooperative Café,
and other community partners. </p>
<p><b>The History of the Exchange:</b></p>
<p>The United Nations designated 2012 the International Year of the
Cooperative. In the spirit of this declaration, a group of
""cooperators"" and community members in Olympia, WA. together with members
of the Cecosesola cooperative in Venezuela, organized an exchange. Two members
of the Olympia Food Coop, along with a group of students from the Evergreen
State College, went to Barquisimeto in January 2012. They worked with
Cecosesola, learned about its history, experienced the organizational process
and brought that knowledge back to share with our own community.  In May 2012 four members of Cecosesola came
to the South Sound region where they worked with the Olympia Food Coop, visited
community organizations, and met with community groups seeking economic
alternatives. The exchange culminated in a two- day conference on cooperatives
that brought over 100 participants from Thurston, Mason and King Counties. The
experience was an enriching, educational and productive one for all involved. </p>
<p>The knowledge gained from our exchange with Cecosesola has contributed
to the development of new cooperatives in the Olympia area, including the New
Moon Cafe and the Northwest Construction Cooperative (NWCC). As Micheal Snow,
administrative coordinator of the NWCC said in a recent letter addressed to
Venezuelan national representatives, ""CECOSESOLA has been instrumental in
demonstrating to us, and the rest of the world, that cooperatives and
cooperativism are a real challenge to capitalism and all its defects... without
the inspiration and example of CECOSESOLA, I sincerely doubt we would be in the
place we are today.""</p>
<p><b>Who are we?</b></p>
<p>CO-SOUND (South Sound Cooperative Network) is a networking and mutual
support organization for cooperatives in our area. We seek to educate our
community about cooperative development, and support the formation of new
cooperatives. Currently, our organization is comprised of representatives from:
The Olympia Food Co-op; The New Moon Collective; The Flaming Eggplant Cafe; The
Northwest Cooperative Development Center; The Evergreen State College; Shelton
Youth Advocacy; and The Northwest Construction Cooperative.</p>
<p>VISION </p>
<p>We are committed to building a vibrant, inter-cultural cooperative
network in our community that includes  current
cooperatives and expands beyond them. We are committed to improving access to
the goods and services offered by these organizations and disseminating
knowledge about how cooperatives work. We commit to supporting groups seeking
economic self-determination through cooperative practice, and to letting social
justice and respect for differences guide our work with one another and our
community.</p>

quality services for low income and working class people at below average cost.

What he found there was a treasure-trove of complete or nearly complete skulls and skeletons of dinosaurs, turtles, snakes, crocodiles, frogs, birds, and even mammals. His early field crews spent time searching for these fossils and camping near the village of Berivotra in northwestern Madagascar (about an hour from the coastal city of Mahajanga). Shortly after beginning work there, Dr. Krause and the members of his expedition found themselves surrounded by children who were observing their work. These are some of the most destitute children in the world. The children that are the focus of his humanitarian work face lives in which basic education and health care are difficult, if not impossible, to come by. These children often die from very treatable medical conditions and face an uncertain future in a country that is one of the most impoverished in the world. Very quickly it became clear that the paleontologists were in a unique position to help these children. They were amazed to discover that $500 US dollars would pay the salary of a teacher for an entire year, and that $300 could buy school supplies for an entire classroom for a full year.

<p>In 2006, I traveled to Nepal, because I was fascinated by the country's culture and unique terrain. Nepal is one of the poorest country's in the world, lacking many basic needs such as clean water, sufficient food and good education. After spending a few months in Nepal I decided I wanted to help educate children in a rural village. That is when my dear friend Rajesh Pariyar (a local Nepali and orphan) and I decided to start the organization Sapana Nepal. Since March 2009, Sapana Nepal has been providing free services to the local villagers of Pumdi, Nepal; services that the rural people did not have access to before our organization was launched. Our services have been very successful and include an Early childhood center that's been running for over six years by local villagers. We have built over 150 Improved Cooking Stoves, a water reserve tank and we continue to tutor local children on a weekly basis. We help villagers in need with medical assistance and community support. All of our projects have been funded by our organizations members along with fundraising projects and private charitable donations. For more information about Sapana Nepal and our projects visit SapanaNepal.org or email <a href=""mailto:SapanaNepal@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SapanaNepal@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><strong>OUR CAMPAIGN</strong></p>
<p>Since the 7.9 earthquake hit Nepal on April 25, rural villages have been devastated, almost decimated and the aftershocks continue to rock the country weeks after the initial earthquake. On May 14th, Sapana Nepal united with the Red Cross and traveled to a village in Gorkha, a small village known as Aruasru  Bang; home to 130 people and 35 households to bring them food. They carried lots of rice, lentils, cooking oil and salt; this staple diet of ""dahl bhaat"" that Nepali's enjoy twice a day. Fortunately, only two deaths were confirmed in the area due to the massive earthquake; however food is scarce and 95% of homes where affected, most of them destroyed. As the villagers try to rebuild, build makeshift homes and continue on with their daily lives they are concerned about the coming monsoon. We hope the food brought to them will last 3-4 weeks. We were the first group of aid to visit the area and we know there are many more villages nearby that could use some assistance as well. Our goal is to raise enough money to help other rural areas in need by bringing them food and materials to rebuild and mend shelters. </p>
<p>It only costs $35 to help feed a family of five for three weeks. However, the transportation costs are extremely expensive due to the rugged terrain of the remote areas. We are focusing our efforts on the most rural areas that are not otherwise receiving relief, areas that can take hours to hike to by foot after the road ends.  We have redirected some of our monthly budget to help with this cuase, but it's not enough!!! We need your generous support in helping the rural villages of Nepal that have been affected by this horrible natural disaster. All proceeds go to delivering food, shelter and medical supplies so that these wonderful people can simply survive as well as start rebuilding their lives. Stay tuned for our weekly updates. Thank you for your time and consideration. Namaste from Sapana Nepal and all of the Nepali people.</p>

Purpose of Perspective

Have you ever heard of a publication that reports the future as if it has already happened?  Neither have I.  Which is why this is a brand new form of entertainment.

Perspective is presented from a alternative reality outlook in the future.  Hyperreality is defined as ""as a condition in which what is real and what is fiction are seamlessly blended together so that there is no clear distinction between where one ends and the other begins.""  Perspective is written from a near future perspective.

The funds go directly to cover the cost to review the magazine and we want to produce a YouTube station for the publication.  
This will be divided into phases this crowdfunding campaign.  The $500 will be to just get the flagship issue launched by editors and proofreaders.

Twenty years ago, in the first dance class I took, I immediately knew that I could not live anymore without having dance in my life.  No matter what I walked into a dance class carrying on my shoulders, I always left feeling liberated and reenergized.    Once I got to class, everything in my life was left at the door.    This is the what I want to provide the youth of the world with--a safe haven for them to let go of any of life's issues, a place where they can release and revitalize themselves in a nurturing and healthy way.  We are empowering the next generation to preserve the traditions of their ancestors and ground them in an ever-changing world, giving them the strength to overcome the challenges of life through musical expressions. We are supporting the organizations that keep them safe within music and dance.

<h3>Pilot Project Specifics</h3> <p>Our initial goal is to raise $50,000 to complete the Pilot Project and continue planning other projects.

<p>Successfully raising $50,000 for the Pilot Project will enact a sustainable change for the folks in the villages we mentioned, and will also serve as training home base to branch out to other villages once the program is in place.

<p>Once students can access energy to use tools like computers and printers
 reliably, they are able to work on school projects unencumbered by an 
unreliable power source. They can begin working with other students 
world wide on collaborative issues and enact the changes they want to 
see happen in the world.<br/></p>
<p> The Pilot Project is intended to create the platform for an ongoing DFS

<h3>Just a Few Challenges</h3>

<p>Because we are working with villages in Africa, but are located in the United States, we face a geographical challenge.

Our mission has, and always will be to prepare students for a life after they leave our school; part of that mission means helping them to establish healthy, active lifestyles and mature socialization skills. What better way to do so than by learning on a playground with other children! Can you help us  raise an additional $5,000 to create a  play area for students who need it the most?</p><p></p><h3>Here's how you can help!</h3><p>With your contribution we will be able to build a play area complete with slides, swings, climbing walls, and other fun components adventurous kids can enjoy! As a special ""thank you"" for supporting we have a variety of gifts based on the amount of your donation .</p><p></p><h3>No donation is too small to make a BIG impact</h3><p>Children with special needs and disabilities can benefit so much more than most from having a playground, here's why:</p><ul>
<li>It helps them to build crucial social skills, as the children interact with others through the simplicity of play.</li>

<div>
<p>Each user chooses how much they want to give, buying from someone 'replicates' their 'giving-behavior' (temporarily), buying from someone who gives nothing (someone outside the system) replicates that behaviour, and so on and so forth. This might sound weird, but it's really not. A lot of smart people believe in it, and I was recently featured in the mensa (super-high IQ-people) organization's newsletter. So, it might sound weird, but it's smart. <br/><br/><br/><i>Andre Coehlo </i>explained this beautifully,<br/><a href=""http://basicincome.org/news/2015/04/bitnation-basic-income-application-set-for-bitnation/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://basicincome.org/news/2015/04/bitnation-basic-income-application-set-for-bitnation/</a><br/><br/>and <i>Amin Rafiee</i> too,<br/><a href=""http://coinssource.com/bitnation-decentralized-borderless-government-universal-basic-income/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://coinssource.com/bitnation-decentralized-borderless-government-universal-basic-income/</a><br/><br/><br/>I'm not asking you to believe in it. I am asking you to trust me, and the others who believe in me, and to back my work with a couple of dollars.<br/><br/>A core concept is <b>dividend pathways</b>, <br/><br/><br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fvideoseries%3Flist%3DPLb5pvPPb-bHO1ZKHWMq1YhM866vL-TeMy&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DbK6RyAhPgXg%26index%3D8%26list%3DPLb5pvPPb-bHO1ZKHWMq1YhM866vL-TeMy&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FbK6RyAhPgXg%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><br/>These pathways are also really smart, but also a bit hard to grasp. Every time you buy something from someone who's part of Basicincome.co, you will create a dividend pathway. When the node that you bought from sells stuff to other people, it will pay dividends (you can also call it tax) to the Basicincome.co network, and this tax will be divided on the users of the network, but not directly, instead based on the pattern of dividend pathways that exist between consumers and producers. <br/><br/><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434748444/kiz1ddrthly1ps8fk4no.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/>A nodes tax is not only shared on the nodes that have dividend pathways to it, but on every node that has a dividend pathway to any of the nodes that have a dividend pathway to the node.  This is better said with the visualization above. <br/><br/>A way of understanding this is to think about how profit is shared in different types of organization. Corporations give the profit to the CEO, which is smart if you want top-down executive decision making. Co-operatives give the profit to the workers and to the costumers, which is good if you want a more democratic organization. My system gives the profit to an extended network, and lets the co-operative model network, which grows its power and its influence. A co-operative can use my system to put pressure on its entire supply chain to also join Basicincome.co. People who like the co-operative model can join forces to grow their impact. It's very smart. Basicincome.co<i> feeds growth back into the network, </i>and actually makes<b> growth a good thing.<br/></b><br/><br/><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fvideoseries%3Flist%3DPLb5pvPPb-bHO1ZKHWMq1YhM866vL-TeMy&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dbxyjt2T_nLQ%26list%3DPLb5pvPPb-bHO1ZKHWMq1YhM866vL-TeMy&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fbxyjt2T_nLQ%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><br/>When you receive money via your pathways, they will get used up. But you will be creating new pathways as your weeks go on, and these pathways will be constantly adapting to your life and your locality. I said in my pitch to Bitnation that <i>""your safety net emerges through the sum of your financial interactions""</i>, which is pretty spot on. Again, this might sound weird, but 400 mensa members, a couple of famed political persons, a lot of entrepreneurs, some academia people, and some other high-impact people, have all been very impressed by the idea. One person said that I was like his morpheus, he'd been looking for my eureka for 10 years.<br/><br/>There's a lot more to dividend pathways then I could possible go through here. One thing is that <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxyjt2T_nLQ&amp;list=PLb5pvPPb-bHO1ZKHWMq1YhM866vL-TeMy"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">dividend pathways</a> created to someone who gives a lot provide higher flow. This means that you will want to buy from people who give a lot, and they will want to give a lot to compete over customers. This incentive structure <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/voluntary-basic-income-on-a-co-op-dividend-scheme/www.bitnation-blog.com/voluntary-basic-income-on-a-co-op-dividend-scheme/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">has been used by co-operatives for a century</a>, and I evolve it. There's a lot of patterns in my system that has existed in one form or another in the past, and I'm sort of remixing the best ideas out there, adding a bit of my own ingenuity, and creating what has been promised to <i>'lead the way for people to see the true power of decentralization and peer to peer technology'.</i><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><i><br/></i></span><br/><br/>

<b><br/>Bitnation </b>is a sort of pirate party 2.0, that has taken the world by storm in the past year. The movement was born out of the Bitcoin-movement, and uses the technology that makes Bitcoin decentralized to decentralize everything, from money to law to parlament to welfare. Decentralization is a natural reaction to evolution, and Bitnation is the logical conclusion of the internet. We have already decentralized social media, and we are about to decentralize everything.<br/><br/><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434817869/otkadd9xrzbhogzs8t6p.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>The movement that has grown fast in the past year, and Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, the charismatic leader of Bitnation, has had frequent invitations to speak at high-profile networks such as Google and TED. She discovered my work almost a year ago, and has since been promoting it as what might become an important part of the future Bitnation ecosystem.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><h3><b>The Blockchain</b></h3>
<br/>The invention that started it all is the blockchain. The blockchain will let you network with those you trust, and it will let those you trust network with those they trust, and this will let networks of trust, overlapping networks throughout which we extend our trust, it will let those networks rule the world. <br/><br/>Exactly how the blockchain works, and what it's good for, is really hard to explain. People often make sarcastic remarks about people mumbling something to explain Bitcoin, and, yeah, I see what they mean by that, but the problem is really that we don't have a language for these things yet. They are so new, it's like trying to explain the internet 30 years ago,<br/><i><br/>""and you'll be able to send electronic signals to anyone anywhere and send messages and do all kinds of things""</i><br/><br/><i>""why would I want that when I can just go to the post office !?""<br/></i><br/>So, I won't try to tell you about what the blockchain is in detail, but it's good that you know that it has pawed the way for systems like my Resilience. <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><h3><b>TOMORROW</b></h3>

IntroductionI'm creating something wonderful. A new kind of taxation infrastructure, and the first use case will be unconditional basic income. You don't have to wait for your authorities to give basic income to you, you can use the internet to create new authorities.You might think that my system is just another hype. But, it's not. I've been at this for a year now, there's been a steady increase in attention. Take a couple of your dollars, put it into my startup-phase with Basicincome.co, and see it turn into a global peer-to-peer basic income network.REFERENCES:""To be able to create what is the beginning of a decentralised financial security – basic income – but without relying on a government, instead relying solely on technology and your own personal network, feels incredible. I know I’ll be the first one to sign up! What Johan Nygren has come up with is truly amazing!”https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/bitnation-announces-decentralized-application-basic-income-based-bitcoin-2-0-technology-voluntary-fees/
 ""The BitNation team displayed their excitement to incorporate this platform and highlighting its aim to provide a naturally peaceful solution. ""
http://coinssource.com/bitnation-decentralized-borderless-government-universal-basic-income/""We have a Bitnation 3rd Party DApp, called basicincome.co developed by the Swedish prodigy Johan Nygren, using p2p cryptoledgers to create a voluntary basic income system. ""
http://hplusmagazine.com/2015/02/18/interview-bitcoin-pioneer-susanne-tarkowski-tempelhof-on-bitnation-and-m/""Basicincome.co is a part of the Resilience protocol, which is a 21st century web-based standard for dividend allocation within a co-operative. ""
http://www.basicincome.org/news/2015/04/bitnation-basic-income-application-set-for-bitnation/""Instead of receiving a share of the profit of a centralized network, each person would receive a share of the profit from a vast number of smaller decentralized clusters. The accumulative dividend flow would be pretty much the same, as in the amount of basic income. ""
http://www.bitnation-blog.com/voluntary-basic-income-on-a-co-op-dividend-scheme/
""Perhaps the most eyecatching digital basic income out there is the one associated with BitNation. ""

TECHNICAL:


My plan is to support all currencies on all financial platforms. I use subscribe functions from APIs, which makes it easy.


Each user chooses how much they want to give, buying from someone 'replicates' their 'giving-behavior' (temporarily), buying from someone who gives nothing (someone outside the system) replicates that behaviour, and so on and so forth. This might sound weird, but it's really not. A lot of smart people believe in it, and I was recently featured in the mensa (super-high IQ-people) organization's newsletter. So, it might sound weird, but it's smart. Andre Coehlo explained this beautifully,http://basicincome.org/news/2015/04/bitnation-basic-income-application-set-for-bitnation/and Amin Rafiee too,http://coinssource.com/bitnation-decentralized-borderless-government-universal-basic-income/I'm not asking you to believe in it. I am asking you to trust me, and the others who believe in me, and to back my work with a couple of dollars.A core concept is dividend pathways, These pathways are also really smart, but also a bit hard to grasp. Every time you buy something from someone who's part of Basicincome.co, you will create a dividend pathway. When the node that you bought from sells stuff to other people, it will pay dividends (you can also call it tax) to the Basicincome.co network, and this tax will be divided on the users of the network, but not directly, instead based on the pattern of dividend pathways that exist between consumers and producers. 

A nodes tax is not only shared on the nodes that have dividend pathways to it, but on every node that has a dividend pathway to any of the nodes that have a dividend pathway to the node.  This is better said with the visualization above. A way of understanding this is to think about how profit is shared in different types of organization. Corporations give the profit to the CEO, which is smart if you want top-down executive decision making. Co-operatives give the profit to the workers and to the costumers, which is good if you want a more democratic organization. My system gives the profit to an extended network, and lets the co-operative model network, which grows its power and its influence. A co-operative can use my system to put pressure on its entire supply chain to also join Basicincome.co. People who like the co-operative model can join forces to grow their impact. It's very smart. Basicincome.co feeds growth back into the network, and actually makes growth a good thing.When you receive money via your pathways, they will get used up. But you will be creating new pathways as your weeks go on, and these pathways will be constantly adapting to your life and your locality. I said in my pitch to Bitnation that ""your safety net emerges through the sum of your financial interactions"", which is pretty spot on. Again, this might sound weird, but 400 mensa members, a couple of famed political persons, a lot of entrepreneurs, some academia people, and some other high-impact people, have all been very impressed by the idea. One person said that I was like his morpheus, he'd been looking for my eureka for 10 years.There's a lot more to dividend pathways then I could possible go through here. One thing is that dividend pathways created to someone who gives a lot provide higher flow. This means that you will want to buy from people who give a lot, and they will want to give a lot to compete over customers. This incentive structure has been used by co-operatives for a century, and I evolve it. There's a lot of patterns in my system that has existed in one form or another in the past, and I'm sort of remixing the best ideas out there, adding a bit of my own ingenuity, and creating what has been promised to 'lead the way for people to see the true power of decentralization and peer to peer technology'.
I have alot of content online. Look it up, learn, explore, and back me so I can transform the world. That is my dream. This is my dream. And, again, Basicincome.co is built on my Resilience protocol, and it's just the first use-case of what will become a new taxation infrastructure.

Bitnation is a sort of pirate party 2.0, that has taken the world by storm in the past year. The movement was born out of the Bitcoin-movement, and uses the technology that makes Bitcoin decentralized to decentralize everything, from money to law to parlament to welfare. Decentralization is a natural reaction to evolution, and Bitnation is the logical conclusion of the internet. We have already decentralized social media, and we are about to decentralize everything.The movement that has grown fast in the past year, and Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof, the charismatic leader of Bitnation, has had frequent invitations to speak at high-profile networks such as Google and TED. She discovered my work almost a year ago, and has since been promoting it as what might become an important part of the future Bitnation ecosystem.The Blockchain
The invention that started it all is the blockchain. The blockchain will let you network with those you trust, and it will let those you trust network with those they trust, and this will let networks of trust, overlapping networks throughout which we extend our trust, it will let those networks rule the world. Exactly how the blockchain works, and what it's good for, is really hard to explain. People often make sarcastic remarks about people mumbling something to explain Bitcoin, and, yeah, I see what they mean by that, but the problem is really that we don't have a language for these things yet. They are so new, it's like trying to explain the internet 30 years ago,""and you'll be able to send electronic signals to anyone anywhere and send messages and do all kinds of things""""why would I want that when I can just go to the post office !?""So, I won't try to tell you about what the blockchain is in detail, but it's good that you know that it has pawed the way for systems like my Resilience. TOMORROW
""Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.""I give you Susanne Tarkowksi Tempelhof, the disruptor who's co-ordinating the evolution of Bitnation,",7.0,6,"2 Campaigns

<ul>

<li>Lack of ""real"" graduate job placement assistance</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So as you can see there are several problems with colleges and universities these days and we will solve them starting with cost.</p>
<p><strong>Question:</strong>  Why do most people who want to go to college end up NOT going?</p>
<p><strong>Number 1 Reason:</strong>  The cost!</p>
<br/>
<h3>Problem 1:  High Cost of College</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433164685/rygn82z5c2x6fbigumpt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

As you may have noticed, the cost of college is astronomical!  And there is no reason for it.  For example, there are colleges that get billions of dollars in endowments and donations each year, but the tuition for those schools are the highest!  It doesn't make sense.  Also, have you noticed that colleges nickel and dime you to death with fees?  They have admission fees, graduation fees, transfer fees, technology fees, registration fees, student activity fees, and many others!  By the time all those fees are added to your tuition, your tuition has doubled.  Again, it does not make sense - especially for on-line schools!  The tuition should easily be able to take care of everything, and it should be reasonable.

<br/><br/>
<h4>Our Solution to High Cost:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Change the business model.  Our realistic and common sense infrastructure and business model will ensure that our tuition rate will be one of the lowest in the country, if not the lowest.  We researched private colleges that offer similar programs to those that we will be offering, and we were shocked.  For example, a basic two-year associate degree ranged from $24,000 to over $38,000!  And that is just for an associate degree!  You can double those costs for a four-year bachelor degree.  <b>Our associate degree will be one fourth the cost of their programs!  That's 75% less, and for a better degree!</b>
</li>
<li>There will be <b>no fees</b>!  Period!</li>
<li>We will establish a not-for-profit foundation and 100% of all donations will go to pay for tuition scholarships and grants for those who need it.  Any funds received above and beyond our funding goal for this campaign will be applied to other phases of the project or go to the not-for-profit foundation.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h3>Problem 2:  Difficult Admissions Requirements</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433162937/gzdimshg6fhdz4qaalkb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
Most schools have strict and sometimes very difficult admissions requirements, such as credit transfer rules, GPA requirements, admissions test, letters of recommendations, etc.

<br/><br/>
<h4>Our Solution to Difficult Admissions Requirements:</h4>
<ol>
<li>We will not have any strict requirements.  Our requirements will be what are minimally required by the State Department of Education and Regional Accreditation Boards.  And remember, there will be no admissions fee.</li>
<li>You will be able to enroll at any time and get accepted very quickly.  You will not have to wait for a specific enrollment period.</li>
<li>We will have the most flexible course credit transfer rules possible.  We will allow the maximum number of transfer credits based on what are minimally required by the State Department of Education and Regional Accreditation Boards.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Our goal is to make getting into college extremely simple.</strong></p>
<br/>
<h3>Problem 3:  Scheduling Flexibility</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433163011/ygsevphuwg2mzdjifum2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

There are two huge problems you often see with colleges: 1) having to wait for the start of a term; and 2) the courses you need are not offered in a term.

<br/><br/>
<h4>Our Solution to Scheduling Flexibility:</h4>
<ol>
<li>There will not be any terms.  Our schedule will not be based on terms.  You will be able to enroll in a course at any time.</li>
<li>All of our courses will be on-line and available at any time.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h3>Problem 4:  Degree Program and Course Issues</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433163146/kaeuisbnqrqb7mbbwgvd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Often degree programs are not marketable and courses are not relevant to the program.  We have engineered processes to solve these problems.  All of our degree programs will be highly sought after and marketable.

<br/><br/>
<h4>Our Solution to Degree Program and Course Issues:</h4>
<ol>
<li>We will perform a needs analysis for all of our programs and courses.  We will research the needs of employers.  Our courses will be current and relevant based on what knowledge and skills employers are looking for.  It only makes sense!  Why take a course that is not needed?</li>
<li>All of our professors will be required to have several years of ""real world"" experience in their field of expertise and not just have a college degree.  Our students will greatly benefit from this experience being passed on to them in their courses.</li>
<li>Our programs and courses will focus on how to apply the knowledge you learned in a course, rather than just bookwork or memorization.  In most cases our students will be learning by doing.</li>
<li>Our courses will be smaller, bite-sized, and cover the specific information you need to know.  Most courses offered by colleges are long and drawn out over a period of time, often causing unnecessary information added to the courses just to meet course size requirements.  We will not add fluff to a course just to meet course size requirements.</li>
<li>We have designed detailed review processes in place to ensure our programs and courses remain current and relevant.  We will continue to review the knowledge and skills employers are looking for.</li>
</ol>
<br/>
<h3>Problem 5:  School Issues</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433163275/q9lprfutxjxsjzw0c9mv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>Schools are often not very transparent about their programs, costs, 
staff, and requirements.  You have to dig or talk to admissions staff 
member, who is often a sales person, just to find out something.  There 
are schools that don't even post their tuition costs on their website.  
You have to call them and talk to a salesperson to find out.  Usually, 
this means they have something to hide, such as high tuition rates.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Additionally, most schools don't offer much in terms of graduate job placement assistance.  Often they simply offer counseling and not much more.  We will offer ""real"" graduate job placement assistance to help our graduates find work when they graduate.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h4>Our Solution to School Transparency:</h4>
<ul>
<li>We will be extremely transparent.  You will be able to easily find any information about our programs, costs, staff, or any other information on our web site and school catalog.  We will also have academic advisers, not admissions or sales staff, available to answer any questions.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h4>Our Solution to Graduate Job Placement Assistance:</h4>
<ol>
<li>We will partner with state employment agencies, recruiters, and employers to bring them and our graduates together.</li>

<h3>Project Goals</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433163896/vd0rz5qeh15caffdgprl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h4>Phase 1:  Infrastructure</h4>
<ul>
<li>In this first phase we will need to develop the infrastructure and processes to design, develop, and deliver our programs and courses to our students.  This is required and needs to be in place for licensing and accreditation purposes.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Phase 2:  Course Development</h4>
<ul>
<li>In this phase, our instructors, subject matter experts, and academic staff will develop the needed courses for the degree programs.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Phase 3:  Department of Education License and Approvals</h4>
<ul>
<li>In this phase we will secure the required approvals and licensing through the state Department of Education.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Phase 4:  Accreditation</h4>
<ul>
<li>In this phase we will apply for accreditation.  School accreditation is extremely important because it shows that a school meets certain standards of quality.  It also helps with program acceptability and recognition by other schools for the transfer of credits and validity of the program by employers.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h3>Project Team</h3>
<ul>
<li>The project team consists of several higher education professionals with years of experience in teaching, education administration, education development, and licensing and accreditation.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>The project team is lead by Gary Harris, a long time educator, who was a former Dean of a large on-line university, and is retired from the United States Air Force.  His impressive credentials and passion for education has spanned more than 30 years.  Gary has developed and taught several courses and has managed the design and development of over 120 courses.<br/><br/>

<p>We can accomplish these goals with your support and start a new college like no other.</p>
<ul>
<li>A college that has reasonable tuition rates and does not put a financial burden on students.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>A college that is easy to get in and be able to enroll in the courses you need.<br/><br/>

<li>A college that offers relevant and quality programs and courses with degrees that are highly marketable.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>A college that will ""really"" help their graduates find work.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
<h3>How will the funds be used?</h3>
<p>As you can see, this sizable undertaking will require some serious funding needs.  But with your support, we can do it.</p>
<ul>
<li>The goal of this campaign is to raise the funds for phase 1 of the project which is to develop the infrastructure and processes to deliver our programs and courses.  This will include the development of needed systems such as a learning and student management and mobile web systems; and the development of processes and policies, such as course development and delivery processes.  This will also help fund two new positions for this work.  All of this sounds boring, but it is required to be in place before applying for licensing and accreditation.

</li>
<li>Any funds received above and beyond our funding goal for this campaign will be applied to other phases of the project or go to the not-for-profit foundation.  If we don't reach our funding goal, we will still apply the funds received to the project and continue to work to fund the project because we believe in this project.  This will simply slow the project, but not stop it.<br/><br/>

<ul>
<li>The risks are minimal.  None of the risks will stop the project, but simply delay it, such as limited funding.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>The one main challenge we have is the requirement to have everything in place prior to applying for Department of Education approvals and licenses.

<p><strong style=""color: Blue;"">Together, we can make a difference in many people's lives - maybe even yours.</strong></p></div>","Let's build a college!

Join us in starting an accredited college that will ""truly"" be reasonably priced and help those who need and desire get a quality college education.

Problems we will solve:

High Cost

High Tuition
Fees for just about anything


Difficult Admissions Requirements

Strict credit transfer rules
High GPA requirements
Admissions tests
Letters of recommendations


Scheduling Flexibility

Having to wait for the start of a term
Not offering the courses you need in a term


Degree Program and Course Issues

Courses are not relevant to the program
Degree not marketable


School Issues

Schools are not transparent
Lack of ""real"" graduate job placement assistance



So as you can see there are several problems with colleges and universities these days and we will solve them starting with cost.
Question:  Why do most people who want to go to college end up NOT going?
Number 1 Reason:  The cost!

Problem 1:  High Cost of College


As you may have noticed, the cost of college is astronomical!  And there is no reason for it.  For example, there are colleges that get billions of dollars in endowments and donations each year, but the tuition for those schools are the highest!  It doesn't make sense.  Also, have you noticed that colleges nickel and dime you to death with fees?  They have admission fees, graduation fees, transfer fees, technology fees, registration fees, student activity fees, and many others!  By the time all those fees are added to your tuition, your tuition has doubled.  Again, it does not make sense - especially for on-line schools!  The tuition should easily be able to take care of everything, and it should be reasonable.


Our Solution to High Cost:

Change the business model.  Our realistic and common sense infrastructure and business model will ensure that our tuition rate will be one of the lowest in the country, if not the lowest.  We researched private colleges that offer similar programs to those that we will be offering, and we were shocked.  For example, a basic two-year associate degree ranged from $24,000 to over $38,000!  And that is just for an associate degree!  You can double those costs for a four-year bachelor degree.  Our associate degree will be one fourth the cost of their programs!  That's 75% less, and for a better degree!

There will be no fees!  Period!
We will establish a not-for-profit foundation and 100% of all donations will go to pay for tuition scholarships and grants for those who need it.  Any funds received above and beyond our funding goal for this campaign will be applied to other phases of the project or go to the not-for-profit foundation.


Problem 2:  Difficult Admissions Requirements

Most schools have strict and sometimes very difficult admissions requirements, such as credit transfer rules, GPA requirements, admissions test, letters of recommendations, etc.


Our Solution to Difficult Admissions Requirements:

We will not have any strict requirements.  Our requirements will be what are minimally required by the State Department of Education and Regional Accreditation Boards.  And remember, there will be no admissions fee.
You will be able to enroll at any time and get accepted very quickly.  You will not have to wait for a specific enrollment period.
We will have the most flexible course credit transfer rules possible.  We will allow the maximum number of transfer credits based on what are minimally required by the State Department of Education and Regional Accreditation Boards.

Our goal is to make getting into college extremely simple.

Problem 3:  Scheduling Flexibility


There are two huge problems you often see with colleges: 1) having to wait for the start of a term; and 2) the courses you need are not offered in a term.


Our Solution to Scheduling Flexibility:

There will not be any terms.  Our schedule will not be based on terms.  You will be able to enroll in a course at any time.
All of our courses will be on-line and available at any time.


Problem 4:  Degree Program and Course Issues


Often degree programs are not marketable and courses are not relevant to the program.  We have engineered processes to solve these problems.  All of our degree programs will be highly sought after and marketable.


Our Solution to Degree Program and Course Issues:

We will perform a needs analysis for all of our programs and courses.  We will research the needs of employers.  Our courses will be current and relevant based on what knowledge and skills employers are looking for.  It only makes sense!  Why take a course that is not needed?
All of our professors will be required to have several years of ""real world"" experience in their field of expertise and not just have a college degree.  Our students will greatly benefit from this experience being passed on to them in their courses.
Our programs and courses will focus on how to apply the knowledge you learned in a course, rather than just bookwork or memorization.  In most cases our students will be learning by doing.
Our courses will be smaller, bite-sized, and cover the specific information you need to know.  Most courses offered by colleges are long and drawn out over a period of time, often causing unnecessary information added to the courses just to meet course size requirements.  We will not add fluff to a course just to meet course size requirements.
We have designed detailed review processes in place to ensure our programs and courses remain current and relevant.  We will continue to review the knowledge and skills employers are looking for.


Problem 5:  School Issues


Schools are often not very transparent about their programs, costs, 
staff, and requirements.  You have to dig or talk to admissions staff 
member, who is often a sales person, just to find out something.  There 
are schools that don't even post their tuition costs on their website.  
You have to call them and talk to a salesperson to find out.  Usually, 
this means they have something to hide, such as high tuition rates.


Additionally, most schools don't offer much in terms of graduate job placement assistance.  Often they simply offer counseling and not much more.  We will offer ""real"" graduate job placement assistance to help our graduates find work when they graduate.


Our Solution to School Transparency:

We will be extremely transparent.  You will be able to easily find any information about our programs, costs, staff, or any other information on our web site and school catalog.  We will also have academic advisers, not admissions or sales staff, available to answer any questions.


Our Solution to Graduate Job Placement Assistance:

We will partner with state employment agencies, recruiters, and employers to bring them and our graduates together.
We will establish our own on-line jobs board.  Our graduates will be able to post their resumes at no cost.  Employers and recruiters will be able to search and access those resumes.  Additionally, employers and recruiters will be able to post jobs to the job site that our graduates will be able to access.
Our graduates will have access to a trained career counselor on staff that will provide guidance, answer questions, and review resumes.
Our graduates will have access to professional development and continuing education courses after graduation to help you keep your skills sharp, current, and relevant so you can stay competitive in your career.  They can help you with career and salary advancement by becoming more effective in your job.


Project Goals

Phase 1:  Infrastructure

In this first phase we will need to develop the infrastructure and processes to design, develop, and deliver our programs and courses to our students.  This is required and needs to be in place for licensing and accreditation purposes.

Phase 2:  Course Development

In this phase, our instructors, subject matter experts, and academic staff will develop the needed courses for the degree programs.

Phase 3:  Department of Education License and Approvals

In this phase we will secure the required approvals and licensing through the state Department of Education.

Phase 4:  Accreditation

In this phase we will apply for accreditation.  School accreditation is extremely important because it shows that a school meets certain standards of quality.  It also helps with program acceptability and recognition by other schools for the transfer of credits and validity of the program by employers.


Project Team

The project team consists of several higher education professionals with years of experience in teaching, education administration, education development, and licensing and accreditation.

The project team is lead by Gary Harris, a long time educator, who was a former Dean of a large on-line university, and is retired from the United States Air Force.  His impressive credentials and passion for education has spanned more than 30 years.  Gary has developed and taught several courses and has managed the design and development of over 120 courses.



Gary has a master's degree in Engineering Management, has project management credentials from PMI and Stanford University, and is currently working on an Education Specialist degree at the University of Missouri.


The Impact - A College Like No Other

We can accomplish these goals with your support and start a new college like no other.

A college that has reasonable tuition rates and does not put a financial burden on students.

A college that is easy to get in and be able to enroll in the courses you need.

A college that offers relevant and quality programs and courses with degrees that are highly marketable.

A college that will ""really"" help their graduates find work.

This will include the development of needed systems such as a learning and student management and mobile web systems; and the development of processes and policies, such as course development and delivery processes.  This will also help fund two new positions for this work.  All of this sounds boring, but it is required to be in place before applying for licensing and accreditation.



52% of the funds received will go to perks and rewards and 48% will go to the project phase to develop the infrastructure and processes to deliver our programs and courses.


Any funds received above and beyond our funding goal for this campaign will be applied to other phases of the project or go to the not-for-profit foundation.  If we don't reach our funding goal, we will still apply the funds received to the project and continue to work to fund the project because we believe in this project.

This includes the infrastructure, processes and policies, degree programs and courses, headquarters facility, instructors, and support staff.

Now, you might have heard Woody Allen’s warning, ‘Just don’t take any courses where they make you read <i>Beowulf</i>.’ But take, for example, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> or <i>Game of Thrones</i> with their grand battles, fearsome monsters and brave heroes. The epic motion pictures of today owe much to the heroic epic of old. Even though <i>Beowulf</i> was written more than a thousand years ago, its message is surprisingly modern: what it takes to be a hero. After all, is it not so that everyone wants to be one? Some want to destroy the Ring, others – power. And <i>I</i> want to take a course where they would make me read <i>Beowulf</i>.</p><p>Like a hero does, I set off on a journey, since Poland’s distance from Northwest Europe can be a bit of a disadvantage when it comes to Anglo-Saxon and Viking studies. The lack of experts and sources prompted me to leave home in summer 2013 and make for Britain, where I had to fight monsters – like a hero.</p><p>The brutal life of an immigrant was the first to come: as a newcomer to the UK, I had limited job opportunities, which usually meant underpaid labour. No matter my first class degree, I mopped the floor, washed grime dishes, and cleaned toilets.</p><p>Time was next: often holding more than one position, I tried to balance my professional life and academic pursuits. After work, I was writing my personal statement for postgraduate study at Durham and I was rewarded when my offer letter arrived.</p><p>And the most fearsome, money, comes last: I come from a lower-class background; my family cannot support me financially. Through my hard work I have accumulated approximately £13,500, the best part of what I need to cover tuition, meals and accommodation, books and resources. But the total cost of study is £17,000. Hence my kind request for your support in this fight.</p><p>Ally yourself with me and donate. You can change my life!</p><br/><div>

Now, you might have heard Woody Allen’s warning, ‘Just don’t take any courses where they make you read Beowulf.’ But take, for example, The Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones with their grand battles, fearsome monsters and brave heroes. The epic motion pictures of today owe much to the heroic epic of old. Even though Beowulf was written more than a thousand years ago, its message is surprisingly modern: what it takes to be a hero. After all, is it not so that everyone wants to be one? Some want to destroy the Ring, others – power. And I want to take a course where they would make me read Beowulf.Like a hero does, I set off on a journey, since Poland’s distance from Northwest Europe can be a bit of a disadvantage when it comes to Anglo-Saxon and Viking studies. The lack of experts and sources prompted me to leave home in summer 2013 and make for Britain, where I had to fight monsters – like a hero.The brutal life of an immigrant was the first to come: as a newcomer to the UK, I had limited job opportunities, which usually meant underpaid labour. No matter my first class degree, I mopped the floor, washed grime dishes, and cleaned toilets.Time was next: often holding more than one position, I tried to balance my professional life and academic pursuits. After work, I was writing my personal statement for postgraduate study at Durham and I was rewarded when my offer letter arrived.And the most fearsome, money, comes last: I come from a lower-class background; my family cannot support me financially. Through my hard work I have accumulated approximately £13,500, the best part of what I need to cover tuition, meals and accommodation, books and resources. But the total cost of study is £17,000. Hence my kind request for your support in this fight.Ally yourself with me and donate. You can change my life!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

We, the Trustees and Friends of CARE Pakistan in the UK, beleive that the best tribute possible to each life lost is to invest in the one thing that can directly undercut the criminal ignorance that took their lives. EDUCATION.
The sad fact is that Pakistan has the second largest number of children out of school in the world, at more than 7 million.  Even sadder is the fact that there are tens of thousands of government schools across the country which are non functional.

CARE is the only Pakistani charity that focuses on adopting, repairing and equipping government schools and running them at a standard comparable to the better private schools. Presently CARE educates 175000 children in 257 schools across Pakistan. 
When CARE adopts these schools they have a basic building but no facilities at all;  no electricity, no fans, no black boards, no furniture and most importantly no teachers who teach and so no education.  CARE repairs the buildings and adds more rooms according to need, puts in fans, electricity, toilets, running water, furniture, a library, a laboratory and most importantly  teachers it has trained with  Montessori and other state of the art teaching methodologies.  The result is that children flock to the CARE schools .

We believe CARE's model is the most economically efficient and effective way to counter the education crisis in Pakistan.


It only takes £14000 to repair and equip a school of 350 children and run it for a year. 
If 500 people were to give £28 each we could have the school up and running within 2 weeks....that is all it takes.

NEWS FLASH!  Sunday, April 19, 2015!  The Shillers have just donated  $2000 in fulfillment of their offer of a matching grant!  This is a wonderful BOOST to our fund-raising effort!  Thank you to ALL our supporters for stepping up to the challenge!  (Please take a look at our new perks, especially for our many grateful Shiller fans!)
In Haiti, people with disabilities need rehab — and they need to receive their therapy from Haitian therapists!  A new Rehab Department is about to open  at the Episcopal University of Haiti  ( UNEPH*).  The new department is affiliated with their well-respected School of Nursing (FSIL*) .The nursing school started the first four-year degree in nursing, in just the same way, at UNEPH, ten years ago.  It now also has a master's degree program for Family Nurse Practioners!
We will offer 4-year degrees in Occupational Therapy (OT, or in French érgothérapie) and Physical Therapy (PT, or in French physiothérapie). For the first time Haiti will have its own team of rehab professionals: OTs and PTs who will be able to do it all:


evaluate patients
plan therapy
supervise rehab technicians
assess progress
implement prevention programs

advocate for rights of persons with disabilities


The healthcare system of this remarkable country is about to take a step into its promising future — with your help! 
We are a group of volunteer OT and PT faculty, a nurse, a public health analyst, a Haitian rehab technician, and a social worker.  We work  in partnership with Haitian rehabilitation clinics and UNEPH.  Our hands are full with planning for curriculum, clinical education sites, materials, and faculty. 

Right now, we need to stock the library!  We need $22,400 to buy a class set of textbooks in French for one year, for each class, and to buy a tablet for each student, which will be pre-loaded with curricular resources. 

We also need scholarship money for our first class of students and for salaries for our Haitian staff.  We are in the process of submitting formal grant applications for operating funds for the first two years, and for construction of additional classrooms to begin next fall.   Our full budget for the first year is posted on our website, at www.haitirehab.org.

We need your help!  And we have two new PERKS, staying with our theme of BOOKS!


All donors  will receive Gabby's recipe for Sōs Pwa: a delicious vegetarian supper entrée! 


For a gift of $40 we will send you a beautiful book of photographs, called Two Good Feet, by Marc-Yves Regis 1, a Haitian photojournalist.  See a picture of the book on the Gallery page! 


Donors who give $60 will have a textbook dedicated in their name.  


If you can give $100 or more, you will also receive a one-pound bag of marvelous rich Haitian coffee, from the Singing Rooster (even-more-than-fair-trade) Company.  


A unique gift for yourself or someone you love is available for a donation of $100!  Robert J. Shiller will autograph a copy of the new 3d edition of Irrational Exuberance - the book that brought psychological insights to economics! 


And if you can give us $15,000 toward our dream, you will be flown to Haiti as our VIP guest, to attend the opening ceremonies of the new rehab department, at the end of September 2015, in Léogâne!

Can't make a contribution now?  Please help by sending on our link, spreading the word and keeping the excitement going!

Much of their summer is spent at home wasting time, and not preparing for their future responsibilities and obligations as our next generation of leaders.</p>
<br/><p>We also see in today’s workforce people who simply don’t have a good work ethic. Many are unable to get past entry level positions, and frequently bounce from job to job. In short, they lack the necessary foundation and tools needed to succeed and thrive in a career and thus become stricken in poverty.</p>
<p>SOLUTION…</p>
<p>Traverse Life Center decided to take these two problems and marry them together with a solution.  Our solution is an educational program called Life Works.  Life Works is designed to stop generational poverty before it gets started by educating young people with employable skills.  We offer young people ages twelve to fifteen an eight week training program in employment and life skills that will help equip them for their future.  The boy’s education program runs five days a week from 8:00-4:00 and the girl’s education program runs 3 days a week 8:30-4:00.</p>

The Traverse Life Center is a non-profit organization dedicated to reducing poverty and family breakdown in our community. Our core values state that all people are designed and gifted to make a positive contribution in this world. The Traverse Life Center attacks the problem of poverty and family breakdown in unique ways.
Life Works Program Overview:
PROBLEM…
Our future leaders from ages 12-15 years old are old enough to stay at home unsupervised during the summer months, yet are too young for most entry level jobs. Much of their summer is spent at home wasting time, and not preparing for their future responsibilities and obligations as our next generation of leaders.
We also see in today’s workforce people who simply don’t have a good work ethic. Many are unable to get past entry level positions, and frequently bounce from job to job. In short, they lack the necessary foundation and tools needed to succeed and thrive in a career and thus become stricken in poverty.
SOLUTION…
Traverse Life Center decided to take these two problems and marry them together with a solution.  Our solution is an educational program called Life Works.  Life Works is designed to stop generational poverty before it gets started by educating young people with employable skills.  We offer young people ages twelve to fifteen an eight week training program in employment and life skills that will help equip them for their future.  The boy’s education program runs five days a week from 8:00-4:00 and the girl’s education program runs 3 days a week 8:30-4:00.


What they're taught:
They’re taught that each one of them have value and are wired with different gifts and talents that are meant to be used to generate income and make a difference in the world.

They’re taught how to be responsible.  They are required to set their own alarm clocks to get up in the morning.  Their parents are not allowed to do this for them.  If they’re going to be absent for the day they need to call their crew leader and explain why, not their parents.  Just like a real job.
They’re taught useful and employable skills such as: how to use tools, power equipment, cook, sew, how to communicate with others, how to set proper boundaries, how to handle finances, how to maintain and take care of things they own and use, how to respect authority, and that actions have consequences.

They’re taught that the world does not revolve around them but was made to be impacted by them.  They learn this by doing work projects for people in our community.  They have built a brick walkway for a fire department, worked with Team Elmer’s to plant flowers at the Women’s Resource house and installed a handicap accessible walkway at an adult care facility. They’ve also worked at Reining Liberty Ranch doing projects for the veterans around the ranch, they have stained decks, put up drywall, painted, chopped wood, bailed hay and many other projects for people.
They're taught that working hard has its rewards. Each day they have a time card and are paid “shekels” based on their performance. These factors include: timeliness, coming prepared, participating as expected during the workday, how they interact with their family at night, obedience, and helping out around the house. Parents are able to add or subtract shekels based on their daily home interaction. Every few weeks they’re able to spend those shekels on items in an auction. It might be a gift card, bike, football, fishing pole, camera or other item available. It requires them to figure out how much they need to save to get what they want, and it teaches them a very important life concept of delayed gratification.

Since the inception of the Life Works Education Program in 2013 we have had 43 young people participate and benefit from it.
Purpose and specific use of funds:
 The Traverse Life Center is seeking assistance in the purchase of student tools, shirts, boots, auction items, and instructional fees.
2015 Life Works Proposed Budget:

$9,556.10 Student tools, shirts, boots, auction items, instructional fees
$6,360.38 Program purchases; misc. tools, supplies, fuel, community project supplies
$32,000 Crew Leader expense

The actual cost per young man is $1,446.52 and per young lady is $1,100.00. However, we believe that every young person should have the opportunity to learn these very important skills, so we only charge $50.00 per student.  Life Works is a yearly education program that is sustained by grants, donations and fundraising.
Number of people served and benefited:  304+

36 students with an average family size of 4 = 144 people

Advice and guidance is from the following credited
psychologist and professors, whose support and mentorship is much appreciated.
Dr Paul Jose –
Associate Professor Psychology, Victoria University
Dr Aaron Jarden
– President of The Positive Psychology Association of NZ, Senior Lecturer AUT,
Lead investigator for International Wellbeing Study, Co-editor for
International Jour al of Wellbeing, Senior scientist for Assessing Wellbeing in
Education.“Sometimes it takes a while to recognise that someone has a special ability to get us to believe in a better and different way of living, and to imagine that together we can do great things to impact the wellbeing of our youth, and thus the future of our society. With Brainy Box Tamara is that person who is reaching beyond current limitations of what we know is possible with our youth, and in doing so is utilising a range of contemporary, fun, engaging, and interactive materials.” - Dr Aaron Jarden
Anouk Kelling - MSc
(Hons), PGDipClinPsych, BCA, BA, MNZCCP, Clinical PsychologistThe student's user journey:
· 
Student registers for Brainy
Box
· 
Student fills out survey 
· 
Student requests or is assigned their Box Theme which best seems to identify with their needs
· 
Box is delivered to student's
school
· 
Student receives box, opens it and interacts with gifts
· 
Student logs into Youth Hub:
creates profile and connects with their mentor
· 
Mentor ‘onboards’ student
to Youth Hub and sets their challenge
· 
Days 1-30: Student is required
to log in daily and submit their challenge results with either an image or word find
from their set challenge.
·  At completion of each challenge the student receives a reward and climbs the Brainy Box leaderboard. Students can connect with the online social space and with other students in their
box theme or in the wider Brainy Box community.
· 
Day 31, the student fills out
same original survey and results calculated
·  In the following week or soTamara Waugh interviews each student to find out what worked and what could be improved

Risks and challenges:
1.  Falling short of the funding amount requiring a downscale of the trial
2.  Any hiccups with logistics, distribution and production of boxes
3.  Youth not engaging with boxes
4.  Corporates and charities unable to facilitate mentoring


Solutions:
1.  Funding grants and corporate partnerships
2.  Allowing enough time for box production and organisation
3.  Focus groups with youth to define their interests and engagements4.  Finding
a ‘buy in’ for charities and corporates that will make this partnership irresistible!

</p>
<p>In June 2014, Latina 50 Plus was launched and is in
the process of building programming to support Latinas over 50 who want to
pursue different career paths,  a degree or career development. The
program will also focus on a mentoring program for younger Latinas who are
looking for support for those with more life experience.  The response to
Latina 50 Plus has been overwhelmingly positive with a strong support base from
many Latina 50 plus professionals from a wide range of career paths. The heart
of Latina 50 Plus is development of the scholarship funds for Latinas over 50
who are interested in moving forward in difference career paths or professional
development. </p>

where women can gather to network, share life experiences and provide a
platform to encourage positive outcomes from self-improvement and development.
Since the June 2014 launch, Latina 50 Plus has hosted a networking event called,
“Café Fuerte Mujeres Fuerte” where Latina’s over 50 met over brunch to discuss
current issues that they are dealing with today as Elders. This event was in
partnership with AARP Latino. March 2015, Latina 50 Plus hosted its’ first
Networking Event at the Bronx Museum of the Arts.<span>  The event included artist’s and business such
as, New York Life, All State, The Bronx Women’s Resource Center, with a
networking panel consisting of our 2014 Latina 50 Plus Honorees.  The panel discussion focused on career paths

<p>In helping build Latina 50 Plus transparency is key,
so therefore there you will be contacted via email on all fundraising sources and
updates as to what programming is being funded and how. This information will be
listed on the Latina 50 Plus website and will be emailed to all funders
periodically. As the creator/founder of Latina 50 Plus in order to launch
Latina 50 Plus, personal funding was used for the 2014 launch. Creating and
managing a budget with limited funding was challenging, but when you believe in
something you make it happen. But I also received support from our community
who believed and continues to believe in the importance of honoring our elders

<p>Here at MSU Denver, our SEDS chapter is currently competing in the<a href=""http://seds.org/projects/usrc/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> 2015 University Student Rocketry Challenge</a><b></b>. This year's challenge is to construct a multi-stage rocket capable of carrying a 1/2lb electronics payload to an altitude of 3000' or greater using less than 640N total impulse. Our team aims to hit at least 5280' carry an additional electronics package with an onboard camera, and include a dual-deploy recovery system. We have our design ready, but now we are in need of enough money to buy the parts to actually build it.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need...</h3>
<p>To make this project a reality, we need your help. In order to buy all the parts and supplies for our rocket we need to raise about $1100. This total includes all the materials, electronics, motors, and tools we need to construct our rocket. </p>

<p>Professional licensure in architecture can be a long, laborious, and expensive proposition, which has led to many young professionals delaying theirs goals of licensure, or giving up on them altogether. The <b>PASS</b> aims to highlight recent changes that make the path to licensure simpler, while maintaining the rigor and value of the license, and to encourage young professionals to commit to making a plan and starting early to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>To promote the launch of the PASS Fund, this campaign will run for duration of the <b>AIAS 7-in-7 Campaign,</b> in which the AIAS National President, Charlie Klecha, will prepare for and take <b>all seven ARE Divisions</b> in seven days at the end of May. During the campaign, Charlie will be sharing his experiences getting ready for the exams, and conclude with a reflection on the entire process.</p>
<div><h3>The Full Story:</h3></div>
<p>Professional licensure in architecture entails a combination
of Education, Experience, and Examination. In the past, these three components
had to be achieved in series, beginning with a professional degree program,
followed by internship and other related experience in a professional setting,
and concluding with a series of registration exams. </p>
<p>Changes made by the National Council of Architectural
Registration Boards, or NCARB, have made it possible in many places to
accomplish these three components in a more parallel fashion than was
previously possible, allowing for experience to be logged as early as high
school graduation, and allowing testing to begin before the experience
component is complete. </p>
<p>To date, trends have not indicated that young professionals
are capitalizing on this new opportunity to achieve licensure earlier in their
careers, and in fact many prolong the process for many years after graduation.
The longer the process is delayed, the more difficult it becomes to stick to a
rigorous schedule of achieving these benchmarks. Some, in fact, delay the
process for so long that they give up on becoming licensed altogether. </p>
<p><b>The world is in increasing need of licensed architects</b>, particularly with respect to a rapidly urbanizing
population, and the myriad new technologies and methods for a more sustainable
and responsible built environment. It is the hope that the PASS will serve to help bring ambitious and passionate young leaders into practice.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>How We Hope to Help:</h3>
<p>There are currently <b>seven divisions</b> of the Architect Registration Exam, <b>each costing $210</b>, which can make it a daunting endeavor for
a recent graduate. On top of this, there is a broad, complex, and ever changing wealth of resources and information on the process and how to get through it. </p>
<p>The PASS is intended to encourage young professionals to
make a plan to move toward professional licensure, and begin on that path as
soon as possible. The scholarship will be made available to alumni of the AIAS
who pass a division of the registration exams <b>within one year of graduating</b>,
and will reimburse them for the full cost of that exam. </p>
<p>To launch the PASS Fund, the AIAS will be producing a weekly series of videos and blogs, called the <b>7-in-7 Campaign</b>, which concludes with AIAS National President Charlie Klecha sitting for all seven exams in one week. The content produced will help young professionals navigate the vast world of resources and information, and craft a plan that is attainable and ambitious. By setting and
achieving these goals, young professionals will no longer see the process of
preparing for and taking the ARE as a distant and difficult task, and <b>will be
more likely to continue </b>moving toward licensure.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>How You Can Help:</h3>
<p>By backing the PASS Fund with a donation today, you will be
actively contributing not only to the progress and stability of the
architectural profession, but also helping young professionals achieve their
ambitious goals to help improve their communities and the world through
architecture.  </p>
<p>Every donation is essential to the success of this program,
and as little as $21 can make a huge difference. Each donation of $210 or more
will match you with one or several recipients of the scholarship so that they
can personally express the importance of the support you've provided and keep
you apprised of the progress they've made. </p>

<h3>Some Questions You Might Have:</h3>
<p><i>Why have you set your target at $50,000?</i></p> <p>In order to establish a fund that is substantively self-sustaining, we estimate an initial need for $50,000 to fund the first few years of scholars. Based on the success of our fundraising, and the number of applicants observed in the first year, we plan to adjust our strategy to suit the expressed needs of the program. </p>
<p><i>How many scholarships will be awarded?</i></p>
<p>For the first year, based on the $50,000 target, we plan to limit the scholarship to 100 recipients. We'll continue seeking ongoing support for the fund, and evaluate ways to promote the opportunity to those on the path to licensure. If successful, this program could eventually be extended beyond the AIAS to the entire emerging professional community.</p>
<p><i>What if a young professional's firm already pays for the exam?</i></p>
<p>Great question. We put a lot of thought into this one, and decided that it doesn't matter. Existing support does not render one ineligible for the program. Based on what we've seen, only a small handful of recent graduates currently take on an ARE division in the first year. If their employer offers funding, the PASS is a way of even further reducing the financial burden on someone already likely to be coping with a relatively low income. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Given the currently perceived income potential in the field of architecture, the prospect of effectively making a profit from moving toward licensure seems to be an apt incentive! </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Perhaps the additional funding from the PASS will make it possible to schedule the next exam! </span></p>

<p>In November 2007, the horrific living conditions of two local elderly men in need of life end care, prompted me to beg some furniture from the local Hilton Hotel to furnish the unused second bedroom in my rented house.  The two gentlemen were moved in and cared for throughout their last days, by myself and two local volunteers.  <strong>The Sanctuary was born.</strong>  Shortly after this, a sibling group of three children (18mths, 3yrs and 5yrs of age) took up residence.  A few months later another sibling group of three children arrived (6, 8 and 12yrs of age) which necessitated more begged furniture.  <b>The Sanctuary has been the only place that our sibling groups can remain together as a family,</b> nurturing growth and providing an environment that facilitates healing from their shared past of abuse, neglect and violence.</p>

We wish to thank all supported this campaign through donations, spreading the word and praying with and for us.  Whilst we may not have made all our goal we will be able to fully kit out the boys bathroom and install new toilets in the other 3 bathrooms, we have been donated the fencing, we still have other equipment and fittings to purchase.  But thanks to you all, we are making a good start.  We will continue our ongoing fundraising and progress news on our  https://www.betterplace.org/en/projects/6480-th...   please join us there.


It has come to our notice that there are some (particularly from the USA), who think because this is coming from Jamaica, that this appeal is a scam.  Not so at all, anyone looking for confirmation of our existence and work need only Google ""Grffin Trust Jamaica"" or ""Moira Morgan Jamaica"", our history is there for all to confirm.  Please check us out and help us if you can.......

My name is Moira Morgan, born in Dublin to a long line of social activists and, as my father would say 'penniless philanthropists'.   From tweens to date volunteering, campaigning, lobbying, and working with and on behalf of children and youth has been my passion and is second nature to me.  

I first came to Jamaica in 1977, spending a couple of months in the then, up and coming working class, residential area of Tower Hill, Kingston 11.  This was just before the political 'war' that preceded the 1980 election.  On my return to Tower Hill eighteen years later, I found, a zinc fenced, poverty stricken, socially disenfranchised, politically tribal, inner city garrison community with a different gang and 'don' on every corner.  What haunted me most was the sound of children crying. Their heart wrenching cries constantly being heard above the sounds of gospel singing churches, raucous dance hall djs and the nightly barrage of gunshot.
With the help of family and friends The Griffin Charitable Trust was established to support the work which I had already begun and it became a charity in its own right in Jamaica in 2005.
Through the Griffin Charitable Trust education and literacy programmes have been established.  Refuge and safe havens have been provided for young children, girls fleeing sexual predation and for women fleeing domestic violence.  Other projects undertaken have included gang mediation programmes and care for the elderly.

In November 2007, the horrific living conditions of two local elderly men in need of life end care, prompted me to beg some furniture from the local Hilton Hotel to furnish the unused second bedroom in my rented house.  The two gentlemen were moved in and cared for throughout their last days, by myself and two local volunteers.  The Sanctuary was born.  Shortly after this, a sibling group of three children (18mths, 3yrs and 5yrs of age) took up residence.  A few months later another sibling group of three children arrived (6, 8 and 12yrs of age) which necessitated more begged furniture.  The Sanctuary has been the only place that our sibling groups can remain together as a family, nurturing growth and providing an environment that facilitates healing from their shared past of abuse, neglect and violence.

</div>Carlos wakes up at dawn, or even a few minutes earlier, and with the empty belly he goes to the landfill of his town in Nicaragua: the chureca, the basurero!<br/>The day starts with a ""hook"" in hand...his best mate: a stick with three tied harpoons at the bottom, which allows him to hook the ""worth"" waste before others (plastic and aluminum can be sold for a few pesos)!<br/><br/>The chureca gets soon crowded with children, the truckloads of waste arriving continually and raising a big fuss, feeding the enthusiasm of the ""researchers"" who often jump on them while still driving; hearths multiply during the day, the air becomes black with toxic smoke, and with watery eyes Carlos’ hands dig incessantly.<br/>Carlos eats what he finds in the trash; his brother, who has a noticeable mental delay (it was indeed caused by some toxic product he ate during childhood) and his mother joins him in the evening holding his sister in her arms, born just a few months ago. She bends over the mountains of garbage and collects a can, the baby bursts out crying. She coughs and calls Carlos, it's time to go home.<br/><br/>Carlos lives in a metal sheet shack, without floor.

</p><p><b>HELLO!</b></p>
<p>I’m Amelia McGee—mother,
parent educator, master of public health, and Seattle resident. I am asking you to donate to my
campaign to start an educational program for new parents in the Seattle area.
It’s called <a href=""www.happybabiesparenteducation.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Happy Babies Parent Education</a>. It will support new parents in their
journey, connecting parenting peers to each other and to a trusted educational
resource. </p>
<p><b>WHY YOU SHOULD DONATE TO HAPPY BABIES</b></p>
<p>In modern
parenting, so many of us live far away from our families. We lack our
proverbial village for childrearing. We don’t know where our mentors are. We
are seeking our people. Parenting is THE
HARDEST thing we will ever do and we need to be supported!</p>
<p>I am asking you to donate to Happy Babies Parent
Education because you know the value of having:</p>

<span><span></span></span>Someone who can answer ALL. THE. QUESTIONS. and
help you find your way as you care for your baby and grow yourself as a parent.</li>

<br/></div>","HELLO!
I’m Amelia McGee—mother,
parent educator, master of public health, and Seattle resident. I am asking you to donate to my
campaign to start an educational program for new parents in the Seattle area.
It’s called Happy Babies Parent Education. It will support new parents in their
journey, connecting parenting peers to each other and to a trusted educational
resource. 
WHY YOU SHOULD DONATE TO HAPPY BABIES
In modern
parenting, so many of us live far away from our families. We lack our
proverbial village for childrearing. We don’t know where our mentors are. We
are seeking our people. Parenting is THE
HARDEST thing we will ever do and we need to be supported!
I am asking you to donate to Happy Babies Parent
Education because you know the value of having:


Someone who can answer ALL. THE. QUESTIONS. and
help you find your way as you care for your baby and grow yourself as a parent.

Somewhere for you and your baby to get out of
the house on a regular basis.

“Peer-ents”! You are in the
3-am-up-to-your-eyeballs-in-poo-and-tears trenches together and their questions are your
questions. 

Maybe you had these pillars of support or maybe you
longed for them. Either way, you know how critically important they are. I know because I
had them—and I am invested* in bringing them to other parents. 
*While
I personally believe that parenting support is priceless, I have also literally invested over $700 of my own money in
creating this program. 
WHAT YOU ARE
SUPPORTING
Your donation towards our goal of $5,000 will pay for the
first quarter of our bare bones operating expenses. This includes: 


$2,000 for two facilitators—a postpartum doula
and a lactation consultant—who are ready to lead two different weekly support groups
for new parents—one for new parents and one for lactation help

$2,500 to cover renting a space at a local yoga
studio, as well as advertising and supplies—like snacks and hair ties (postpartum
shedding!)

~10% to cover crowdfunding fees

HOW WE WILL GROW
Over time, we hope to make enough through our classes to
cover our expenses. We also will be seeking to build a fiscal sponsorship relationship
with a maternal and child health-related 501c3 to further help ensure that Happy
Babies Parent Education is a sustainable endeavor.

<div>
<b>Sky News:</b>""Children are the unseen victims of Greece's debt: abandoned because of a crisis that began before many were even born""</div>
<div>
<b>Daily Mail</b>:""Athens' Ark of the World youth center said four children, including a newborn baby, had been left on its doorstep in recent months.""</div>
<div>
<b>Washington Post</b>:""Either deserted at maternity wards days after their birth, bundled inside pillowcases, or packed in cardboard boxes dumped on the doorsteps of churches, clinics and charity centers, abandoned babies are turning up all over the country.""</div>
<div>That is just a vague description of the big picture we are currently witnessing in Athens and the rest of the country.Whatever you imagine is not even close to reality.Just a short walk around Omonoia Square and Metaxourgeio is a proper slap in the face,a hard welcome to the cruel actuality.Street children (though the term 'street children' is problematic as it can be employed as a stigmatizing label) are among the most physically visible of all children, living and working on the roads and public squares of cities all over the country. Yet, paradoxically, they are also among the most 'invisible' and therefore hardest children to reach with vital services such as education and health-care, and the most difficult to protect.I could have  uploaded hundreds of photographs depicting kids sleeping under bridges or searching garbage bins for some food but what would be the point in that?The problem exists and gets gigantic proportions as days go by.The headlines and broadcasts of major international news channels serve as uncontradicted evidence of the obvious.</div>
<div>I have decided to set up a crowdfunding project exactly because i want to better the future of these children.I am quite realistic to know that i cannot change it,i cannot provide them with a decent family environment no matter how hard i want it.But every little help can make a big difference. I did not know about the crowdfunding platforms to be honest.Just very recently became familiar with this entire ""new world"" for me, and i believe that can really connect people of different ethnic groups,different religions and beliefs and improve our world.The economic recession has been causing an ever-increasing influx of social and economic problems and, consequently, an increase in the calls for assistance, to which the association felt the compelling need to respond to. Many people affected by the crisis have not been able to cover for their everyday needs, and child welfare organizations are experiencing dramatic budget cuts and reduced funding</div>
<div>I am not asking you to raise funds for the payment of the Greek debt.I do not believe that you must pay for all the corruption of Greek political scene,the tax evasion of payers and the financial mismanagement of Greek authorities. </div>
<div>What i am asking you is to support our effort  for the children.In Greece there are many decades of non-profit voluntary Organizations and Institutions for Children (with special needs or not) and quite a few hundred of  Social Welfare organizations (more than 100 in Attica alone). Their main concern is defending children's rights, not just on paper but in practice as well, providing services to children on a 24-hour, 7 days a week, 365 days a year-basis, working for their physical, mental, and psychological stability. With zero financial liquidity and zero donations at the current moment are experiencing a financial deadlock, while requests for help and assistance are soaring from children and families with children.Every single Institution  receives, on a daily basis, tens of requests for help from children and families across the country. They are truly anxious about whether they will be able to continue standing by the thousands of children supported until now, but also the thousands in need from now on.The vast majority of these children are so-called “social orphans,” meaning one or both of their parents are still alive. In most of these cases, the government took the children away because of abuse or neglect. Others were simply given up by their families. Many children abandoned in Greece have disabilities or suffer from medical conditions caused by a lack of pre- and neo-natal care. Their parents tend to be poorer and less educated than the general population. Some are struggling with drug or alcohol addictions. Others still live with their parents or grandparents and have a hard time finding work. In many cases newborn abandonment is caused by the hard living conditions of their mothers. These vulnerable parents have little emotional support. They feel unprepared to take care of a baby and believe the state can offer their child a better life.Unfortunately,nowadays, that just isn’t the case. </div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
</div><p>We are seeking to raise 300000$  in order to
support Children Institutions and ensure their supply with  vital necessities </p><p>like <b>heating
oil </b>(on average an orphanage needs 8000 ltrs of heating oil per month)<b>, medicine and food</b>.  Principle goal is to fund at least three (3) institutions working for children who are orphaned, abandoned or whose families are
unable to care for them, as possible. Mainly orphanages, children villages and shelter
Foundations will get benefit from your contributions. Due to the large amount
of NPO’s, Social Welfare organizations and Children Institutions acting in
Greece at the moment, the selection of the ones getting funded is very
difficult. Certain criteria should be taken into account and some serious
scrutinizing must occur. That is the most intractable part of the campaign in
my opinion. <b>Having to manage and dispense other people’s money is a very
demanding and blameful role by itself. But when those funds are destined to
support abandoned children, then , automatically, you start to feel you have so
much on your plate that you’re left feeling overwhelmed and stressed out. That
thought is  utterly terrifying.</b></p>
<p>What I am planning to do is distribute the funds

<div>
<p><b>Why do you offer perks since this is a charity campaign?</b></p>
<p>For 2 main
reasons: A)I strongly believe
that every act of philanthropy must get rewarded with a small token of
appreciation and B)All products are handmade and Greek, thus your contribution
has a dual significance and support.</p>
<p>In any case, should
you want to get involved but you don't want a perk, you can  simply add your contribution without

<p><b>Do you have a company (or any connection to one) that produces any of
the offered perks?</b></p>
<p>Absolutely
not. Neither myself, nor any of my relatives have any affiliation to any of the
manufacturers/producers of the perks whatsoever. The selection of the perks was
made based on : the fast availability of the products in large volumes, and the
traditionality of them.</p>
<p><b>What is the main reason behind the organization of this charity campaign?</b></p>
<p>The main
reason? The support of abandoned children due to Greek crisis, like stated on
the title. There is no hidden meaning or catch. I am a Greek scientist, member
of the academic staff of Medical School of University of Athens for more than 9
years. The reason for pursuing a scientific orientation in the field of Human
Genetics was (and remains) the eradication of Genetic diseases and
abnormalities in children. I am doing the best I can in order to alleviate
children suffering, both in my professional career and my personal life.  Having to watch kids’ sleeping on the streets

<p>Hi, my name is Stephen Haray. I have devoted my life to running and building medical centers throughout the United States and abroad including in the war zone of Baghdad, Iraq. In Hawaii, I was the Executive Director of an island hospice. Now that I've settled down to live the aloha life, I've decided to devote my skills to leading the Accuracy Review of Wikipedias Foundation, because together we can do more for humanity and future generations by improving upon the best methods of crowdsourcing to prevent inaccuracies, bias, difficult to read, and out-of-date passages in the reference material on which the whole world has come to depend.</p>
<p>I'm asking you to donate to hire professional fact checkers and proofreaders to create current, accurate and easy to read Wikipedia articles. By donating, you won't just help insure that Wikipedia content is higher quality for yourself, you will also be helping billions of your fellow human beings.

</p><h3>What we need and what you get</h3>
<p>We're trying to raise enough money to hire as many checkers and proofreaders as possible. We could easily use several million dollars per year, but it will be easier to get grants from the the WikiEd Foundation and Wikimedia Foundation donors once we have proven our technology on a statistically significant number of paid task trials, and we think the minimum required to do that is $5,000. Even a fraction of that would go a long way to demonstrating our multi-level accuracy review technology.</p>

<p>We pay professional fact checkers and proofreaders, and accept the help of volunteers in the best traditions of crowdsourced encyclopedia improvements, along with sysadmins and Python programmers to improve the Mediawiki bots we use to find candidate passages in Wikipedia for review, improve automation of reviewer workflow, maintain servers with an auditable reviewer reputation database, and produce the necessary reports.</p>

If we raise at least $100,000, the first twenty donors of $2,500 or more will be invited to a party at Steve Haray's farm on Maui.</p>

Accuracy Review of Wikipedias Foundation is dedicated to maintaining accurate, unbiased, easy to understand, free, and open Wikipedia articles.
Hi, my name is Stephen Haray. I have devoted my life to running and building medical centers throughout the United States and abroad including in the war zone of Baghdad, Iraq. In Hawaii, I was the Executive Director of an island hospice. Now that I've settled down to live the aloha life, I've decided to devote my skills to leading the Accuracy Review of Wikipedias Foundation, because together we can do more for humanity and future generations by improving upon the best methods of crowdsourcing to prevent inaccuracies, bias, difficult to read, and out-of-date passages in the reference material on which the whole world has come to depend.
I'm asking you to donate to hire professional fact checkers and proofreaders to create current, accurate and easy to read Wikipedia articles. By donating, you won't just help insure that Wikipedia content is higher quality for yourself, you will also be helping billions of your fellow human beings.

What we need and what you get
We're trying to raise enough money to hire as many checkers and proofreaders as possible. We could easily use several million dollars per year, but it will be easier to get grants from the the WikiEd Foundation and Wikimedia Foundation donors once we have proven our technology on a statistically significant number of paid task trials, and we think the minimum required to do that is $5,000. Even a fraction of that would go a long way to demonstrating our multi-level accuracy review technology.

We pay professional fact checkers and proofreaders, and accept the help of volunteers in the best traditions of crowdsourced encyclopedia improvements, along with sysadmins and Python programmers to improve the Mediawiki bots we use to find candidate passages in Wikipedia for review, improve automation of reviewer workflow, maintain servers with an auditable reviewer reputation database, and produce the necessary reports.
We are offering the following perks with the AROWF logo: 
stickers, t-shirts, hoodies, canvas tote bags, water bottles, a USB thumb drives, USB battery chargers, and wall posters of Steve Lewis's accuracy review process diagram shown above. If we raise at least $100,000, the first twenty donors of $2,500 or more will be invited to a party at Steve Haray's farm on Maui.
The impact
The importance of accuracy on Wikipedia can not be overstated. Everyone in all walks of life in the developed and developing world depend on Wikipedia for basic information, skills, news, and obtaining assistance. How many times have your questions been answered by Wikipedia?
The Wikimedia Foundation can't spend any of the millions of dollars they raise on opposing paid advocacy by improving articles without risking libel and defamation lawsuits, and less than a quarter of their budget is spent on ""direct support to the communities."" Former Wikimedia Foundation Director Sue Gardner warns that donating to the Wikimedia Foundation is not supporting Wikipedia article quality improvements, and may lead to corruption within Wikipedia Editor Chapters.
Moreover, Google uses Wikipedia to detect news events and measure their magnitude, and to improve the accuracy of its PageRank search results. Wouldn't you prefer to support those efforts directly, instead of having to wait for a Wikimedia grantmaking effectiveness review committee to recommend spinning off a new Foundation? You don't have to wait; please contribute generously today.

and youths about local herbs and their uses as well as empower them to create
Herbal Clubs and establish Herbal Gardens in their schools as a means to help improve on their health, the
environment as well as their general living standards</p>
<p>I remember using Aloe Vera to rub on the bruises I
obtained during play. Today, it is rather unfortunate that a majority of children

<p>World Health organization reports state that some 80% of the
world’s population depends on traditional medicines for their primary health
care needs, but while herbal plants are in demand, the tradition and culture
associated with them is fading.  As such,
if young people do not develop an appreciation for herbs and conserve them,
then the knowledge and herbs that have developed over generations within
various societies is at risk of becoming extinct.</p>

</h3><p>Dear friends and athletes everywhere,</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Welcome to our TRACK IN THE WOODS @ Harwood Union High School crowd funding page! Here's our vision and story.</span><br/></p><p>OUR GOAL!</p>
<p>We are going to raise $400,000 to build a new, unique, environmentally friendly state-of-the-art 8 lane
destination track and field complex – a TRACK IN THE WOODS - for
Harwood Union High School in Vermont's Mad River Valley, the state of Vermont, and the Northeast as a whole. </p><p>We are starting our project with this $40,000 IndieGogo campaign to show the world that we've got grassroots support for this exciting and unique idea. Join us as a donor!</p>
<p>WHY A NEW TRACK?</p>
<p>Here's the story. Harwood Union High School’s current track is decades-old, covered with grass, and in dramatic disrepair. (CHECK OUT OUR FUN VIDEO). This,
despite the fact that 10-15% of the Harwood student body participate in track
and field related sports throughout the school year, AND Harwood's boys and girls
cross country and track teams have won a total of THIRTY FIVE Vermont state
Division II championships during the past FORTY years. “The Harwood Track &amp;
Field program prides itself on being an all inclusive program, allowing varying
abilities to participate, while still being one of the top Teams in Vermont Division
II, with multiple Team State Championships as well as numerous individual State
titles,” explains head coach Taggert Haslam. ""We always ask  - how hard are you willing to work for your
teammates’ success?""  </p><p>WHY NOW?</p><p>Given our incredible legacy at Harwood, we feel it is now time to build
our high school, our towns, and our state a Harwood TRACK IN THE WOODS that reflects the
history, pride, and future prospects of our community – a track we can all celebrate
and enjoy!</p>
<p>WHAT IS A ""TRACK IN THE WOODS,"" EXACTLY?<span><br/></span></p>
<p> Picture this. We imagine our Harwood TRACK
IN THE WOODS complex as a unique athletic facility in the heart of central Vermont that matches our region’s
character. We will design and build our TRACK IN THE WOODS in an
environmentally-friendly way: selectively cutting trees, harvesting on-site wood
and stone for on-site facilities, and tapping into the local wisdom of our
foresters, designers, architects, construction engineers, coaches, and athletes
to create a destination complex of which all of us can be proud, AND a site
that attracts athletes from all over the state and region.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">$40,000 - IS THAT ENOUGH MONEY TO FUND THIS INCREDIBLE IDEA?</span></p>
<p>Not quite. We have a two-phase plan
to fund the Harwood TRACK IN THE WOODS, based on an estimated  $320,000 cost for the 400 meter track itself.
(WONKY MATH ALERT: 8 lanes of 400 meters each = 3200 meters; so $40,000 buys a single lane, and $100 buys one meter of each lane).</p><p>So...</p>
<p>Phase 1: We will raise $40,000 from
the HUHS running community, alumni, friends, families and supporters to support
a single lane through our INDIE GOGO crowd-funding campaign. (September through December 2015).  ($100 buys a meter; all $100 donors or more
will have their names affixed on a plaque that will grace the Harwood TRACK IN
THE WOODS entrance.)</p>
<p>Phase 2: We will raise $280,000
through business sponsorships and foundation partnerships to complete Harwood TRACK IN THE WOODS funding for
the track itself – businesses and foundations can buy /fund lanes or share the
cost of lanes, and will be honored on our site in some public way.

<div>Every summer, thousands of high school (and a few middle school) students from all across the United States and several countries across the globe converge on the campus of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to celebrate, share and participate in fantastic theater. For decades, the International Thespian Society, a students organization  that focuses on service through and to educational theater, has held and grown this maxing event to become the ""Broadway of High School Theater"". Supported by the Educational Theater Ascociation, schools participate at many levels. Any school can bring a group and see dozens of shows, attend educational workshops, meet college reps and share their passion with other like minded students from all over the world. Students come with their own ideas, mounting shows within the week with the new friends they have met. Troupes can sign up for limited stage space to perform in play marathons that run all week. Some schools compete in their own states to earn a spot on the chapter select Showcase, where states and region show off their best work on stage in short cuttings or one acts.  And then, full length shows can apply to be one of a very few of the Main Stage performances that highlights the week.</div>
<div>This is where we are. We have very ambitiously applied with two shows, from two of our high schools, Bradford High School and Indian Trail High School and Academy. The shows have two completely different groups of students from all over the county to represent Kenosha on the Mainstage. </div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3>
<div>The cost per student for is trip is $850.00. That includes room and board for the week and transportation to and from the festival. This does not include the production costs, which we try to raise separately. We have 100 members of our company, cast and crew, from our two shows. That's it, that's what we're fundraising for; room, board and transportation for our students. We refuse to leave anyone behind.</div>
<div>Our first show:</div>
<div>Representing Indian Trail High School and Academy, Hello! My Baby, an original musical written and directed by Cheri Steinkelner. Cheri lives and works in California, but came to direct the festival entry after work shopping her production with us last year. The show includes memorable songs from the 19-teens and a gender bending plot that Shakespeare would be proud of. This show was adjudicated and accepted to the festival in November. </div>
<div>Our second show:</div>
<div>Representing Bradford High School, Disney's The Little Mermaid. Our hope in picking the classic story that so many of our students grew up watching was actually to do a joint project with a performing school in China, where the story is well known and very popular. Sadly, due to the way the school calendars, the festival and our potential new friends exam schedules lined up, the joint project did not go through, but our very dedicated group did not want to put the project aside. This show will be adjudicated March 7th. We have decided not to wait to fund raise, but to plan ahead and work our butts off so we will all be at the festival together.</div>
<div>If we don't make our goal, we will spread the money out and lessen the cost on individual families. If we can take the bus per student cost off the top, then students will only be paying room and board.</div>
<div>The total bus cost will be 200.00 per student.  <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Room and board make the balance.</span>
</div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>I could write a book on why theater is an important part of education and what the value of the arts in society is, but I will spare you that and tell you what this festival does for our students.</div>
<div>On the very practical side, this allows them to be seen by colleges who come specifically to scout students for their programs. And the Mainstage is the best way to do it. They can also audition for scholarships even if they are not planning to go into the performing arts for a living. </div>
<div>Less tangible, but even more important, they connect and communicate with people they will never forget and would never have met otherwise. Careers have started at this festival. Life long friendships have started at his festival. New found passions and untapped confidences have grown at this festival. </div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>Being between two major metropolitan areas, we have a lot of students who are economically challenged. We are not arts schools, we are not private schools. Kenosha Unified is a public school district with a high number of families that fall into the free and reduced lunch programs. Raising money is a challenge for us. As adults, we are artists, dedicated to our students and our work, but not wise in the where's and how's of pulling in funds. We hope to start changing that and we hope you will help us to do it.</div>
<div>What we have going for us is this: KUSD Theater produces great art. Our great art is the result of the talent and dedication of our students. Every student deserves to be on the Mainstage. We will not leave one of these talented, hard working, deserving young artists behind because of money. As educators, as parents, and as a community, this is our goal.</div>
<div>Our parents are planning local fundraisers, we canvas and sing at local farmers markets and our students produce benefit shows to help raise money for the trip. We are reaching beyond the borders of our county to ask for your help to get us to the International Thespian Festival this year. </div>

We have alumni all over the country, working in and out of the arts. You know you're out there! Spread the word and help your successors have the same amazing experiences you did.

<div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>As the publisher of The Paper Maché children's newspaper I see my background     experience and training as a perfect marriage for this work.  I studied journalism and was a reporter for a small town Prairie newspaper  where I was editor of a children's column.  Later I obtained a degree in Education and  taught at several elementary schools.  It was no wonder the idea to have children's work published in a newspaper stayed with me since the mid 80's and is is now a real and exciting dream come true.</p>
<p>I think the motivating energy to keep pursuing the idea of children having an opportunity to see their work published came from my first hand experience as a reporter.  It was always thrilling to see my work in print after working hard on a story.  My research revealed that there was a lot of literature out there that was written for children by adults, including my column, but nothing exclusively dedicated to publishing children's writing  and artwork.  So why not a newspaper . . . and The Paper Maché was born!</p>
<p>Of course like every story there is the short version and the ""how long do you have "" version but for the purpose of this campaign let's say that there has been a lot of good fortune and many angels along the way.  This is our third year of publication and we have just published issue number 31 and issue 32 is ready to be laid out.   <br/></p>

<p>The Society prints 6,000 copies of the 16 page newspaper every month during the school year and they are delivered to all the elementary schools in the Victoria, British Columbia capital region.  Approximately 15,000 students have an opportunity to read the paper and readership increases considerably when the paper is shared at home with parents.  You can read our past issues here - <a href=""http://papermpublishing.com/past_issues.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://papermpublishing.com/past_issues.htm</a></p>
<p>In the first couple of years of publishing advertising was the way to cover part of the cost of production.  However it's common knowledge in the newspaper industry that advertising revenue has dropped off considerably and most publications are struggling. This is certainly true for The Paper Maché.<br/></p>
<p> And that is what brought this campaign about.  We need $7,000 for next year's  production.  This includes printing, administration, design, car/gas and contingencies.  This will cover the monthly expense of $700 for the 10 month school year 2015 - 2016.  <br/></p>
<p>This is a remarkable and unique cause and the Paper Maché is a valuable venue for children's creativity. By 
publishing children's writing and art work we are supporting, developing  and 
growing  literacy that inspires and influences children's self-esteem.<br/></p>

The initial plan for the platform was to help comic book store owners broaden their customer base, but we quickly learned that our platform could be the answer to an even bigger problem. With the right features, Reality Comics could make the world of comics easier not just for store owners, but for the indie creators trying to sell their books, and for the enthusiasts looking for a place where they are celebrated. <br/><br/>We also spent those 3 months creating a companion app to the platform for both Android and iOS.

You have to have a website, a ton of social media accounts, an eCommerce page to sell your work, and a host of bills just to keep those sites up. Why has there not been a social network that combines all the features of social media with the direct sale benefits of eCommerce yet?Well, that is what we are here to accomplish!We launched the alpha build of the community in October2014 at www.reality-comics.com to test our initial ideas, features, and code. Over the past 3 months, through constant feedback from our 100 plus alpha testers, we refined our approach and design. The initial plan for the platform was to help comic book store owners broaden their customer base, but we quickly learned that our platform could be the answer to an even bigger problem. With the right features, Reality Comics could make the world of comics easier not just for store owners, but for the indie creators trying to sell their books, and for the enthusiasts looking for a place where they are celebrated. We also spent those 3 months creating a companion app to the platform for both Android and iOS. We recently launched the Android version to the Google Play Store and in the weeks to come, plan to submit the iOS version as well to the Apple App Store as well.Download the android app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.slinfy.realitycomics&hl=enWe need your support and help in finishing this project. We have created the alpha build of the website at reality-comics.com and apps for iPhone and Android, but the features we want to introduce that will benefit the indie creators and store owners the most  require a lot of man power and financial resources, something we do not currently have.By helping fund this project, we will be able to hire the rest of our programming team, buy more servers, and invest heavily in the architecture of the platform so that it is safe, easy to use and always online.Buy and Sell comics: For the indie creators out there looking to get their comics into as many hands as possible, this is the place to be.  Your profile is your business. With a store front, you can sell your comics directly to other members without requiring people to go to another website. It is a great place for readers to discover and support indie comics.Auction House: A place where members can post their comics up for auction. With only a 2.5% transaction fee, this is the cheapest auction system that is also safe and easy to use.Reality X-Change: The best companion to all comic book collectors! Look up the current value of your comics, find out if it is gaining value or losing value, and get alerts on what new books you should buy that may be valuable over time.Badges: take part in community challenges to earn badges and points from local comic book stores, and indie creators. The biggest game of achievement hunting now comes to the world of social networking in a whole new way!Social Centric: listen to podcasts or upload your own, watch and share videos, participate in forum discussions, discover new stores, and make new friends in a fun, safe and supportive online community.Custom Gift Box Reward Example (See Below)If you want to partner up with us, and offer your comic book as a reward to our backers, email us at community@reality-comics.com and we will work out a partnership agreement.Account levels:Will the platform be free to use?Yes. Everyone can create an account for free and use the platform free of charge. But there will be specific features that will require a subscription to use.

</p>
<p> Smart Kids Don’t Get High Foundation is about saving children lives. Our
vision is to help millions of children Worldwide say “No” to marijuana and
“Yes” to education.</p>


Education is the key to our children’s future,

<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>
<p>Billions of dollars are being spent to legalize
marijuana and there has been very little money spent on marijuana awareness for
our children about the harm it can cause. It appears that America has forgotten
about our kids. </p>
<p>Marijuana continues to be the most commonly used
illicit drug, according to Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration7.3 percent of Americans over 12 reported using pot last year. </p>

Smart Kids Don't Get High Foundation have assist children with books and lesson plans to teachers. </div>
<div>
<p>A study
from <i>The Lancet Psychiatry</i>, found that people who smoke marijuana, as
teenagers are more likely than people who don't to drop out of high school,
become dependent on cannabis.  
We need to provide books
and posters in communities and schools to educate our youth.</p>
</div>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>
<p>In
order to provide these resources, we are looking for funding. Here's how you
can help!</p>
<p>$5.  Give one classroom a 18”x24” color poster </p>
<p>$10. Give a book to
one child </p>
<p>$250. Give a book to a
classroom of 25 students</p>
<p>$10,000. Give books to
an entire school</p>
<p><b>Every $10 you donate will give a child an offer of literacy
and the tools to say “NO” to marijuana. 
</b></p>
<p><b><i>We need your contribution, your support and your help in
spreading the awareness of drug prevention</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p>
<p><b>Help us
fight the war on marijuana use!</b></p>
<p></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary 

 Smart Kids Don’t Get High Foundation is about saving children lives. Our
vision is to help millions of children Worldwide say “No” to marijuana and
“Yes” to education.


Education is the key to our children’s future,
but with the legalization of marijuana, our children’s future will be
jeopardized by poor choices of the use of marijuana and it’s affect on their brains.    
What We Need & What You Get 

We hope to
give 55,000 books to kids and 10,000 color posters for classrooms. We need to raise a minimum of $50,000
All funds will go toward buying books for kids and providing posters to classroom.


The Impact

Billions of dollars are being spent to legalize
marijuana and there has been very little money spent on marijuana awareness for
our children about the harm it can cause. It appears that America has forgotten
about our kids. 
Marijuana continues to be the most commonly used
illicit drug, according to Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration7.3 percent of Americans over 12 reported using pot last year. 

Smart Kids Don't Get High Foundation have assist children with books and lesson plans to teachers. 

A study
from The Lancet Psychiatry, found that people who smoke marijuana, as
teenagers are more likely than people who don't to drop out of high school,
become dependent on cannabis.  
We need to provide books
and posters in communities and schools to educate our youth.



    Other Ways You Can Help

In
order to provide these resources, we are looking for funding. Here's how you
can help!
$5.  Give one classroom a 18”x24” color poster 
$10. Give a book to
one child 
$250. Give a book to a
classroom of 25 students
$10,000. Give books to
an entire school
Every $10 you donate will give a child an offer of literacy
and the tools to say “NO” to marijuana. 

We need your contribution, your support and your help in
spreading the awareness of drug prevention.
Help us
fight the war on marijuana use!

The child you don’t help could easily
be your own child. We need to come together and make a difference. Marijuana is
the # 1 drug choice among underage teens in America.

Why | What | Our Campaign | The Scientists | The Science | Supporters | FAQs


The Science
Psychedelics have long been recognized as an ancient spiritual practice, protected under freedom of religion and belief. In surveys, most people who use psychedelics say that they do so to induce deeply personally meaningful mystical experiences.
In clinical studies, most participants say that the psychedelic experience was among the most significant and transformative events of their lives, comparable to the birth of their first child.
Research from the EmmaSofia founders is featured in Nature this week:

Participate in the 2016 UN General Assembly Special Session on drugs in NYC, in order to, in the words of the Global Commission on Drug Policy: ""Ensure that the international conventions are interpreted and/or revised to accommodate robust experimentation with harm reduction, decriminalization, and legal regulatory policies.""
Assist in human rights court cases involving MDMA and psychedelics.
Prepare for clinical trials in Norway. We will seek state funding for the trials themselves, but protocol development, project acquisition, and application processes are resource-demanding.
Develop an MDMA/psychedelic clinic in Oslo, which will welcome international clients. The clinic will treat posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), alcoholism, drug addictions, and other disorders.

<p>STTV was my school counseling master's project in 2003.  I create STTV because I saw the effects that poor social skills were having in the classroom and on the playground and because I struggled with these same kinds of issues when I was in school. I knew that if I could help teachers and students talk about bullying and social emotional literacy, I could effect how students did in class and how they interacted with each other. I was right. <br/></p>

</div></div>","My name is Rusty May and the founder of the Bullying and School Safety (BASS) Foundation and SchoolToolsTv (STTV). STTV is a daily one minute anti-bullying and social skills curriculum that teachers access with their class online. 


STTV helps teachers and students connect and create a conversation about the social skills our children need to really succeed and currently reaches over 800 schools and classrooms and over 25,000 students watching the show everyday in the US and Canada.


Do you have one minute (yes, just one) to see what we do?





Teachers that have used STTV say that their students ""achieve better academic results"".
And we want to do so much more.
This year, we want to raise $25,000 to fund a free subscription to 500 schools who desperately need this kind of support. We will focus on schools that serve primarily under privileged populations (Title 1 Schools)  and military families and their children.

Our goal of $25,000 a year for the next 5 years which will allow us to provide the show to 500 new schools a year. The schools we're targeting have an average population of 500 students and that will enable us to be reaching 1,000,000 by 2020. Please help us reach 1,000,000 Children by 2020 and give them the social skills they need to really succeed.


When you donate $5, you'll receive a free copy of our children's eBook entitled Red which is a poem that helps children learn how to notice and deal with anger. We have a version for 4-6 and one for 7-10.

When you donate $25, you'll receive a Peace Out T-Shirt, that I use on the show everyday. Youth and Adult sizes available, depending on stock.

When you donate $50, you'll also receive a free 1 year subscription to STTV for the classroom of your choice.


When you donate $100, you'll also receive a 30 minute Skype visit from me to your classroom.


When you donate $500, you'll receive a free 1 year subscription to STTV for the school of your choice.


When you donate $1,000, you'll also receive an assembly visit from me to the school you chose for the 1 year subscription. 

 
More about STTV and this project:

STTV was my school counseling master's project in 2003.  I create STTV because I saw the effects that poor social skills were having in the classroom and on the playground and because I struggled with these same kinds of issues when I was in school. I knew that if I could help teachers and students talk about bullying and social emotional literacy, I could effect how students did in class and how they interacted with each other. I was right. 
The impact of this mission is huge. These are not bad children, they just have bad habits. We get cards and emails everyday from teachers and students telling us that the show is working and making a difference, both in terms of academic achievement and in terms of healthier, safer classrooms. 
Suspensions and expulsions are a pathway to prison. We can't continue to throw children away because they haven't been taught the skills they need to succeed. If not us, who and if not now, when?
 The biggest challenge that we face is getting the word out to the schools who need our help and convincing them to try the program in this test driven educational environment. 
Teacher need to be told that it's okay to develop the whole child and to realize that a child won't succeed in their classroom unless the child knows that the teacher cares more about them as a person then they do about their test scores.

Android tablets on which a digital library app developed by our technology partner, Library For All, will provide access to picture books in Khmer (the local language) and
English. After the pilot phase, we will scale the project in Cambodia and adapt <i>Let’s Read!</i> for roll out to other
countries in Asia. </p>
<p>As children learn first and best
in their mother tongue, we are curating a starter collection of 50
Khmer-language books comprised of some of the best children's books published in Cambodia. Few children's e-books exist so we are collaborating with Cambodian publishers to license and digitize their material. By participating in this project, the publishers will gain valuable
experience working with e-books, receive digitized copies of their books, and
have access to usage data.  Since
bilingual ability improves educational and employment opportunities, we are
additionally supplying 50 English-language books.</p>

with 60% under the age of 30. As smartphones and tablets become increasingly
affordable, more and more people are accessing information from mobile devices.

few educational resources in Khmer are available online for children. To bridge
this gap, we’ve worked closely with our tech partner to render Khmer

Action for Primary Education (KAPE) and Sipar, who have the experience and know-how to
successfully implement the digital library. They will work with their
affiliated schools and libraries to develop fun reading programs and activities
to bring the books alive. We’ve entered into licensing agreements with
Khmer-language publishers already producing beautiful stories.  And
we’ve partnered with the Cambodian chapter of International Board on

the pilot project will include the purchase of tablets, content licensing fees,
and teacher training, baseline testing, monitoring and evaluation, app refinement and support benefiting 5 schools, 2 mobile libraries.</p>

We are thrilled to announce special edition perks from Dengue
Fever, the popular indie band known for their signature blend of Cambodian pop
and psychedelic rock. They’ve generously donated signed CD’s of their new
album, The Deepest Lake, and kramas
(traditional Cambodian scarves) embroidered with the Dengue Fever cyclo logo. We
only have a limited number of these perks, so hurry and tell your friends! 
Check out their endorsement video of Let’s Read! Asia:

You can find more on Dengue Fever and their amazing work here. 


Thanks to our supporters for helping us raise more than $25,000 in the first week! Here's a video message from our colleague in Phnom Penh.




Look who's talking about us


        






Many children in Asia do not have
access to engaging, colorful storybooks
that inspire a lifelong love of reading. Often, school textbooks are the
only reading material available as children’s books are too expensive for the
average family, especially in rural areas. Realizing this great need, Books for
Asia is launching Let’s Read!, a
project that uses low-cost technology to enable underprivileged children to
attain the most essential of childhood experiences – the magic of becoming lost
in a story. 





The Cambodia Pilot Project
 Let's Read! will pilot in 5 schools and 2 mobile libraries serving low-income communities in Cambodia. Each site will be equipped with
Android tablets on which a digital library app developed by our technology partner, Library For All, will provide access to picture books in Khmer (the local language) and
English. After the pilot phase, we will scale the project in Cambodia and adapt Let’s Read! for roll out to other
countries in Asia. 
As children learn first and best
in their mother tongue, we are curating a starter collection of 50
Khmer-language books comprised of some of the best children's books published in Cambodia. Few children's e-books exist so we are collaborating with Cambodian publishers to license and digitize their material. By participating in this project, the publishers will gain valuable
experience working with e-books, receive digitized copies of their books, and
have access to usage data.  Since
bilingual ability improves educational and employment opportunities, we are
additionally supplying 50 English-language books.








Khmer storybooks by Sipar, which will be available through the library
How does the digital library work?

The digital library app created by Library For All was designed for developing country contexts where internet and electricity access is often limited. The app does not need internet access to be used, only to download additional books. Data and battery usage is minimal. And, the app interface is entirely in Khmer, allowing ease of use by Cambodian students and teachers. 
The e-book collection will be used for weekly storytime sessions, reading festivals, and other related activities. The participating schools and mobile libraries will utilize the app's robust analytics to track student progress and provide individualized attention.

                                                           Sipar Mobile Library                 Photo by: Kwanseok Lee  
Isn't it too soon for a digital library?


Cambodia is a young population,
with 60% under the age of 30. As smartphones and tablets become increasingly
affordable, more and more people are accessing information from mobile devices.
Until recently it was very difficult to render the Khmer language digitally so very
few educational resources in Khmer are available online for children. To bridge
this gap, we’ve worked closely with our tech partner to render Khmer
storybooks.  As a result, e-book
donations now hold the promise of being a more cost-effective, scalable model
than print books, which have high production and transportation costs. 



What have we done so far?
The Asia Foundation's Books for Asia staff on the
ground have formed partnerships with two phenomenal Cambodian education
organizations, Kampuchean
Action for Primary Education (KAPE) and Sipar, who have the experience and know-how to
successfully implement the digital library. They will work with their
affiliated schools and libraries to develop fun reading programs and activities
to bring the books alive. We’ve entered into licensing agreements with
Khmer-language publishers already producing beautiful stories.  And
we’ve partnered with the Cambodian chapter of International Board on
Books for Young People (IBBY) to act as our a local content advisory board to ensure
that the library’s collection responds to students’ needs.
How will your money be used?





We have the right local partners and
the technology ready to go, but need your help to get Let’s Read! off the ground! The net proceeds from this campaign
will enable Books for Asia to launch a successful pilot project in Cambodia and
allow us to apply the knowledge gained to other Asian countries. In Cambodia,
the pilot project will include the purchase of tablets, content licensing fees,
and teacher training, baseline testing, monitoring and evaluation, app refinement and support benefiting 5 schools, 2 mobile libraries.

There are many motorists who see cycling as a threat to their way of life.   The Status quo, drinking and driving, is very powerful.  Many people feel they have a right to endanger others' lives!    Other Ways You Can Help: Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:

Stop by and have a drink, buy a bike, or get your bike repaired.
Tell your friends about who we are and what we are trying to achieve.
 We may survive without your help, but we can BLOW UP if you take part!   two&liquor

<h3>About Nobis Project<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
Founded in 2008, Nobis Project, Inc., is a non-profit
educational organization that supports and collaborates with educators in
providing young people with an education that prepares them to become informed,
active, caring and responsible global citizens, both at home and abroad. Every
year Nobis Project works with hundreds of teachers across the US. More and more we hear from
them that our schools need to rekindle the connection between education and
citizenry, ethics and empathy. In
     service-learning projects the classroom walls disappear and
     teachers and community leaders work together as partners in teaching
     youth. When this happens learning becomes more relevant and meaningful for
     students and through altruism they learn the value of actively participating
     in their community. Nobis Project is committed to making sure that
teachers have the tools, knowledge and confidence to engage their students in
globally focused, service-learning projects. <br/></p>
<h3>We Need You</h3>
<p>This campaign seeks funding to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convert our Nobis
     Global Action Curriculum into a free ebook for teachers. This
     research-based and teacher-tested, service-learning curriculum prepares
     educators to teach their K-12 students to critically analyze issues that
     impact our global society and to take action in a meaningful way. <br/>
</li>
<li>Host a three-day Think
     Tank workshop to bring together highly innovative teachers, scholars,
     community leaders, and students to develop an accompanying toolkit for
     the ebook. The toolkit will include interactive lesson plans and
     corresponding materials to use with grades K-12 that will support the
     Nobis Global Action Curriculum and help educators overcome the initial
     preparation hurdle. </li>
</ul>
<p>The ebook has already produced positive results in pilot
projects by a handful of teachers. By completing the ebook, with expanded
examples from real classrooms and the accompanying toolkit, we hope to make it
available to thousands of educators around the world! </p>
<p></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What Are the Components of the Project?<br/>

<h3>Where Will Your Contributions Go?<br/>

<li>
<span><span></span></span>Think Tank: workshop space rental ($200), lodging ($1000), food ($1400), travel stipends for participants ($3,000)<br/>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>Our previous experience in developing, producing, improving
and delivering educational resources to educators across the U.S. means we are
already prepared for many eventualities. Every project has challenges, but it
is unlikely that there will be challenges we haven't come across already or
won't be able to tackle. We want our backers to feel as important as we think
they are and to receive their rewards on time or early. </p>
<p>We commit to keeping you informed of progress in the months
following the campaign. Our promise to deliver is always going to be challenged
by the complexities of manufacturing, production scheduling, shipping and more.
Therefore, if unexpected issues occur in the delivery schedule, we will do our
utmost to minimize the impact on our backers and devote ourselves to providing
the best experience we can.</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Financial contributions are always appreciated, but there are many other ways to help this campaign! You can:</p> <ul> <li>Help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.

</li> <li>Do you know someone we should invite to participate in the Think Tank? Email us with their contact information!</li>
<li>Do you know a teacher who would be interested in piloting the toolkit, tell them about the project and have them get in touch with us!</li>

the circus all my life.</b> That's me, standing on the shoulders of my friends
and brothers, living my dream of a life in the circus.  <span style=""background-color: initial;"">I started performing professionally in Morocco and
Spain at the age of 13, with the Ali Hassani Troupe, and later, the famed Ben Karim Troupe.  My time with the Hassani and the Ben
Karim troupes was the beginning of my dream come true:  To travel the world with
circus.  </span></p>
<p>When I was a child in the circus, I had to be
tough.  Luckily, I had my eyes open: I was born in
Tangier, and I was a street-wise boy. <b>You could say that circus
gave me a second chance.</b>  </p><p>I came from a large family, and I had their
love following me around the world.  But I saw other kids who did not have
such support.  <span style=""background-color: initial;"">This is not an easy industry.  You push your
body to defy gravity, every day.  You know you must do your best, or you
will be replaced.  With so much pressure, it is easy to get hurt. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> <b>I
learned how important it was to have good mentors, not just good coaches.</b></span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> 
A mentor helps you to train your mind, in addition to your body.</span></p>
<p>In the end, I worked for over 26 different circuses
and performed on 3 different continents.  I even performed for the Queen
of England – twice. <b>Circus has been my life . . . </b></p>
<p>After 30 years of performing, I discovered
coaching, and that is when I became truly happy in the circus.  In 2008, I
transitioned to full-time coaching and retired as a performer. </p>
<p><b>Now, I am doing something I never dared to dream
before:  I am opening my own circus school. And I need your help.</b></p>

the circus belongs to everyone,
and access to Master-level training should be, well - <i>Sahela!</i>    </p>
<p><b>What We Do</b></p><p>The Sellam Circus School (LLC) is a circus arts academy based in Biddeford,
Maine, that will offer both
recreational and professional-level classes in circus skills and performance,
as well as forums on circus history, technical courses in rigging, and practical
introductions to tent
maintenance and mechanics.  Ideally, The Sellam Circus School’s Professional Circus Arts Training (PCAT) course and
PCAT Preparatory course is designed to conclude with one month of training and
performance in the big top tent.  Our
goal is to bring our students into the ring, and connect them with the tradition
of circus, by ensuring their access to Master-level coaches, and the enchanting
environment of the big top tent.   For our first year, we plan to rent our big top . . . but we will quickly be working toward the purchase of our very own chapiteau. </p><p>Poised between circus instruction and cultural
anthropology, The Sellam Circus School is based upon two principles:</p>
<p>· 
Easy
access to world-class, professional circus arts coaching; and</p>
<p>· 
Preservation,
sharing and promotion of the culture and traditions of traveling circus.</p>

what I have learned. </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">My students know that there is one standard that I will insist upon from all who attend my classes:  You must train from the heart.  Coaches enjoy students who love what they do,
and students learn best from coaches with a deep love and appreciation of
circus. </span><br/></p>
<p><b>The mission of The Sellam Circus School is to pass on excellent performance technique, actively preserve the traditions of
circus, and provide a performance venue for graduating students.</b>  The Sellam Circus School is committed to creating avenues for
students to connect with the rich history and traditions of circus.  For that reason, the coaches at
The Sellam Circus School will be carefully selected for their long experience
performing in the circus ring, their effective and safe technique, and
their proven understanding of the culture of circus.  Through over
three decades of performance and coaching around the world, I have been
connecting with the incredible people - students and coaches - that will make The Sellam Circus School a success.  There is just one last ingredient

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The most important tool you can have, as a circus artist, is a strong
foundation of skills.  The Sellam Circus School is working to build the
same strong foundation for itself - starting with a permanent headquarters in a
historically significant building in the downtown district of Biddeford.</span></p><p></p>
<p><b>About Biddeford, Maine . . . </b></p>
<p>Biddeford, Maine pretty
much has it all:  A former mill town, the
vast campus of brick factory buildings that comprise the bulk of the downtown
district are now home to a thriving live/work arts community, a vibrant farm-to-table
restaurant scene, tech and maker studios, and now . . . a circus school!  We’ve had our eye on Biddeford for some time,
and we have a chance to make a very special building in the heart of the
downtown district our permanent home. With a total of over 6,000 useable square feet, and a maximum ceiling height of 35 feet, this location offers the space and
vertical pitch to work every level of aerial tricks, from beginner to advanced.</p>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Right Here, Right Now!</b><br/></p>
<p>Meeting our IndieGoGo goal will provide us the
first, simple ingredients for a great start to our school. 
Here are some of the things your donations could help us to pay for:</p><ul>
<li>Deposit to secure our lease for permanent school space</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Purchase of all needed
     circus equipment</span><br/>
</li>
<li>An operating budget
     (coaching salaries, etc) for first months of business</li>
<li>Insurance and safety
     certification fees</li>
</ul>
<p><b>. . . We Have A Wish List, Too!</b></p>
<p>Here are some of the other needed items and
equipment your donations could help purchase:</p>
<ul>
<li>Points and rigging
     to get some air time</li>
<li>Back stage curtains,
     ring mat and other tent dressings</li>
<li>Used, quality
     bleacher seating</li>
<li>A sign for the top
     of our tent and entrance by a local artist</li>
<li>Crash mats and
     foam-core tumbling tracks</li>
</ul>
<p>We have already received some equipment donations
from generous supporters, and we welcome any further such donations.  We are on our way to a well-dressed school!</p><p></p><p><b style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></b></p><p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Future dreams . . .</b><br/></p><p>At The Sellam Circus School, we believe that opportunity to train in a big top tent is essential to the comprehensive education and evolution of every circus student - whether they are looking to simply build confidence, or build a career.  Our Professional Circus Arts Training program (PCAT) is designed to make big top time a central focus, and we have a handful of future programs that are planned for the chapiteau - including immersive camps, traveling workshops, and much more.  </p><p>However, <b>as a startup company, our immediate focus is to establish our permanent headquarters</b> - and your contribution to this IndieGoGo will help us accomplish just that.  We know that buying our very own tent will take time and hard work, and our business plan accommodates this reality.  Our phases of development include a progression from short-term tent rental, to the eventual purchase or our very own chapiteau.</p><p><b>A Little Bit About Tents </b></p><p>Buying a circus tent is more complicated than you might think!  Traditionally, the best tents tend to come from Italy.  You can find good, used, well-made tents throughout Europe; unfortunately, a good tent is not always easy to find in the U.S.  For that reason, we plan to purchase our tent through European contacts and have it shipped back to the U.S.  We know it will take us a little time to buy our tent – it won’t happen instantly!  But here’s what we can tell you right now about the tent we are working to purchase:</p><ul>
<li>Approximately 24 - 36 meter round tent (121 – 131 feet)</li>
<li>Capacity of up to 1,500 seats</li>
<li>Oval cupola</li>
<li>Minimum 40 foot interior height</li>
</ul><p>This tent size is spacious, and can be used in a variety of ways:  Without seating, the expanse of space will allow us to create peripheral practice areas outside of the center ring, perfect for disciplines such as hand balance, contortion, juggling, clowning, and other activities that do not require full height.  For performances and forums, construction of bleacher seating will allow us to produce profitable, high-volume events. </p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>The Hook-Up</b></p>

and performed on 3 different continents.  I even performed for the Queen
of England – twice. Circus has been my life . . . 
After 30 years of performing, I discovered
coaching, and that is when I became truly happy in the circus.  In 2008, I
transitioned to full-time coaching and retired as a performer. 
Now, I am doing something I never dared to dream
before:  I am opening my own circus school. And I need your help.
A Little Bit About The Sellam Circus School . . . . . . The Sellam Circus School is you.  In Morocco, we have a word:  Sahela.  ""Sahela"" is the word we use to say many things - including honest, good, and simple.   I believe that
the circus belongs to everyone,
and access to Master-level training should be, well - Sahela!    
What We DoThe Sellam Circus School (LLC) is a circus arts academy based in Biddeford,
Maine, that will offer both
recreational and professional-level classes in circus skills and performance,
as well as forums on circus history, technical courses in rigging, and practical
introductions to tent
maintenance and mechanics.  Ideally, The Sellam Circus School’s Professional Circus Arts Training (PCAT) course and
PCAT Preparatory course is designed to conclude with one month of training and
performance in the big top tent.  Our
goal is to bring our students into the ring, and connect them with the tradition
of circus, by ensuring their access to Master-level coaches, and the enchanting
environment of the big top tent.   For our first year, we plan to rent our big top . . . but we will quickly be working toward the purchase of our very own chapiteau. Poised between circus instruction and cultural
anthropology, The Sellam Circus School is based upon two principles:
· 
Easy
access to world-class, professional circus arts coaching; and
· 
Preservation,
sharing and promotion of the culture and traditions of traveling circus.
The Sellam ApproachThe Sellam Circus School is my way to give back
what I have learned. My students know that there is one standard that I will insist upon from all who attend my classes:  You must train from the heart.  Coaches enjoy students who love what they do,
and students learn best from coaches with a deep love and appreciation of
circus. 
The mission of The Sellam Circus School is to pass on excellent performance technique, actively preserve the traditions of
circus, and provide a performance venue for graduating students.  The Sellam Circus School is committed to creating avenues for
students to connect with the rich history and traditions of circus.  For that reason, the coaches at
The Sellam Circus School will be carefully selected for their long experience
performing in the circus ring, their effective and safe technique, and
their proven understanding of the culture of circus.  Through over
three decades of performance and coaching around the world, I have been
connecting with the incredible people - students and coaches - that will make The Sellam Circus School a success.  There is just one last ingredient
missing . . . 
Our Home!
The most important tool you can have, as a circus artist, is a strong
foundation of skills.  The Sellam Circus School is working to build the
same strong foundation for itself - starting with a permanent headquarters in a
historically significant building in the downtown district of Biddeford.
About Biddeford, Maine . . . 
Biddeford, Maine pretty
much has it all:  A former mill town, the
vast campus of brick factory buildings that comprise the bulk of the downtown
district are now home to a thriving live/work arts community, a vibrant farm-to-table
restaurant scene, tech and maker studios, and now . . . a circus school!  We’ve had our eye on Biddeford for some time,
and we have a chance to make a very special building in the heart of the
downtown district our permanent home. With a total of over 6,000 useable square feet, and a maximum ceiling height of 35 feet, this location offers the space and
vertical pitch to work every level of aerial tricks, from beginner to advanced.
Right Here, Right Now!
Meeting our IndieGoGo goal will provide us the
first, simple ingredients for a great start to our school. 
Here are some of the things your donations could help us to pay for:
Deposit to secure our lease for permanent school space

Purchase of all needed
     circus equipment

An operating budget
     (coaching salaries, etc) for first months of business
Insurance and safety
     certification fees

. . . We Have A Wish List, Too!
Here are some of the other needed items and
equipment your donations could help purchase:

Points and rigging
     to get some air time
Back stage curtains,
     ring mat and other tent dressings
Used, quality
     bleacher seating
A sign for the top
     of our tent and entrance by a local artist
Crash mats and
     foam-core tumbling tracks

We have already received some equipment donations
from generous supporters, and we welcome any further such donations.  We are on our way to a well-dressed school!Future dreams . . .At The Sellam Circus School, we believe that opportunity to train in a big top tent is essential to the comprehensive education and evolution of every circus student - whether they are looking to simply build confidence, or build a career.  Our Professional Circus Arts Training program (PCAT) is designed to make big top time a central focus, and we have a handful of future programs that are planned for the chapiteau - including immersive camps, traveling workshops, and much more.  However, as a startup company, our immediate focus is to establish our permanent headquarters - and your contribution to this IndieGoGo will help us accomplish just that.  We know that buying our very own tent will take time and hard work, and our business plan accommodates this reality.  Our phases of development include a progression from short-term tent rental, to the eventual purchase or our very own chapiteau.A Little Bit About Tents Buying a circus tent is more complicated than you might think!  Traditionally, the best tents tend to come from Italy.  You can find good, used, well-made tents throughout Europe; unfortunately, a good tent is not always easy to find in the U.S.  For that reason, we plan to purchase our tent through European contacts and have it shipped back to the U.S.  We know it will take us a little time to buy our tent – it won’t happen instantly!  But here’s what we can tell you right now about the tent we are working to purchase:
Approximately 24 - 36 meter round tent (121 – 131 feet)
Capacity of up to 1,500 seats
Oval cupola
Minimum 40 foot interior height
This tent size is spacious, and can be used in a variety of ways:  Without seating, the expanse of space will allow us to create peripheral practice areas outside of the center ring, perfect for disciplines such as hand balance, contortion, juggling, clowning, and other activities that do not require full height.  For performances and forums, construction of bleacher seating will allow us to produce profitable, high-volume events. The Hook-Up

Your support for the Sellam Circus School comes with great perks!  Hey . . . we know:  It’s
always nice to get a gift.  Here are some
of the rewards you may enjoy for joining us in our dream: 

Autographed, authentic reproduction photo postcard sets from Sellam’s touring days in the circus!

A tee-shirt emblazoned with an always
     original, always hilarious #Sellamism  

A year of tickets to any and all Sellam Circus School shows and events! 
Private lessons with Sellam, and a tee-shirt to take home with you! 
A chance to explore Tangier, Morocco with Sellam, and experience the Moroccan technique of beach acrobatics  
Your name in lights!  An homage to your
     significant contribution in the form of your name added to an authentic
     circus sideshow banner, to be created by a Maine artist . . .
     and displayed in the school.  
Our undying gratitude and total
     happiness!  

A Message From Sellam

""I created The Sellam Circus
School for those who feel they belong inside the dream of circus:  Those
who want to make circus their profession, those looking for a new source of
recreation, adults, children – all are welcome.  I am committed to creating an inclusive environment, and my belief that the circus belongs to everyone. 

The Sellam Circus School
is intended for any size dream, be it a student who wants to build a
career, or simply build confidence.  In my country, the name ""Sellam"" means peace . . . and that is what I hope to build with my school:  A gentle, supportive environment to learn, connect with community, and experience the joy of circus.
The Sellam Circus School will offer a range of classes,
from after-school and summer programs, to technical workshops and private
sessions, to semester-based professional training.  We will always work to provide opportunities for students in need, and to reflect the special community that is circus, back to our neighbors. 
Many of you who are
visiting this page are my friends . . .  I invite all who
have discovered this project to join in the dream of circus.  Perhaps I have worked with your son or daughter, or I have been
your coach.  Maybe you have seen your children grow up in my classes,
or maybe – hopefully – you have realized some of your own circus dreams during
our training time together.  Perhaps we have yet to meet, and your own
story of circus has yet to unfold . . . 
The Sellam Circus School
needs your help.  Together, we can build a school that draws upon the
beauty, discipline, and the love of the circus.""

Because educating the next generations of artists, just like other fields, deserves attention.

The Impact

The research and teaching materials produced by the Open Voice Project will benefit teachers, teaching artists, professors and aspiring playwrights pursuing self study. 
At Higher Education Institutions: There is no comparable study on this topic yet. This project will advance the understanding of important teaching techniques that will develop the next generation of playwrights.
For High School Teachers: The teaching handbook will provide materials for teachers who use creativity to help empower students to find their voice. 
For Aspiring Playwrights: The handbook materials will enable low cost self-study with new information that is normally restricted to Academia or expensive teaching institutions.

In 2013 I got in touch with Theory U and in 2014 I got first time in contact with SPT through Daniel Ludevig and later Arawana Hayashi from Presencing Institute, who co-founded SPT.<br/>Since, I have been applying it in my work with groups as good as possible.<br/>I perceive it as a tremendously powerful and truly innovative tool for action research, especially in high complex stuck situations related to systemic dynamics. It helps in a gentle yet powerful way, building resilient teams and re-connecting to ones higher self. But, I am kind of self-trained in applying it so far. To take my ability working with SPT to a next level, It's time for me to attend the advanced SPT training.<br/><br/><br/>WHAT I HOPE TO<b> <b>PERSONALLY</b> ACHIEVE </b>THROUGH MY PARTICIPATION IN THE YEAR-LONG ADVANCED SPT TRAINING. <br/><br/>Despite having successfully integrated SPT in my work so far, I feel I am just at the beginning of what is actually possible.<br/>For accessing the highes future possibility I hear calling me, I must integrate SPT deeper into my work and being and also spread it into my communities. Therefore I would like to attend the year-long advanced training program, that takes place in New York State (for three intensive week-long blocks) and Berlin (local integration all year long), starting in June 2016 ending May 2017.<br/>The training will support me to grow personally and to bring my work of contributing to societal change to a next level.<br/><br/><br/><p><br/></p>WHAT I HOPE TO ACHIEVE THROUGH MY PARTICIPATION IN THE YEAR-LONG ADVANCED SPT TRAINING IN TERMS OF<b><b> GLOBAL IMPACT FOR CHANGE<br/><br/></b></b>Besides my personal learning, that will contribute to the local SPT community and the projects I am working with, I see huge possibility on another level: CONNECTING TO THE GLOBAL FILED OF CHANGE MAKERS through visiting the US and sharing deep experiences with international participants of the training program, connecting with the Presencing Institute and visiting projects and communities in America before or after the training blocks.

</h3>
</div><div>
<div>The Yachay Wasi, translated from Quechua, means ¨house of knowledge¨. We are a small kindergarten located in the Sacred Valley of Peru, in the small Andean town of Ollantaytambo. Starting out as a cornfield, with the love and determination of over 150 volunteers, we have transformed into an environment for 29 children to learn and grow. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We are a flowering project of a seed planted by Guillermina Sanchez and Jose Manuel, who wanted to help the children of the Sacred Valley--a place where education is not a priority. Jose and Guillermina have committed themselves so entirely to this project, that they now live in the school with their own two children. With this type of commitment comes a lot of sacrifices, and a need for the love and support of others. </div>

</span><h3>Our Mission</h3>
<div>Search ¨Ollantaytambo¨ in any search engine, and you will be flooded with images of the Incan ruins scattered throughout our town. What cannot be expressed by these photos, is the rural beauty and charm that the town itself holds. With its cobblestone streets, buildings older than you can imagine, and rich culture experienced through food and interaction with the locals, it´s as if you have stepped back in time. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The way of life here has maintained a lot of its simplistic and traditional aspects. With this, comes certain mindsets that have remained the same over the years. Most notably is the thought that violence within homes is normal. Violence between a husband and wife, or parents and children, is not viewed here the way it is in other parts of the world. There is a huge lack of education on this topic, and without that, this is a problem that will be continued to be perpetuated through the coming years. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Here at the Yachay Wasi, we acknowledge that violence is not a solution to any problem that may be faced. With this ideal, we strive to educate the children on the importance of problem solving. As a non-traditional school, we find creative ways for the children to interact with their teachers and classmates, while learning valuable life skills. We express learning and growth through love, empowerment, and respect for others and nature. Therefore, establishing a peaceful foundation for these children to build their lives. </div>

<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>-<b>Our Staff</b>: The teachers here are the core of this project. We currently have two classrooms with a teacher and a teacher's assistant in each room. They not only create an intimite, comfortable environment for the children, but also prepare lunch, clean the dishes, create the lesson plans, and organize activities, while still empowering all 29 children with the freedom of love. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>-<b>Supplies for the Children</b>: With certain tools and supplies we can continue to allow the children to explore their creativity. Having a variety of supplies allows us to create activities to develop their fine motor skills and a strong understanding of problem solving.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>-<b>Maintenance: </b>One of the fundamental aspects of keeping this community afloat is being able to keep the electricity on, the telephone and internet running, and paying the rent. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>-<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Expansion: </b>One of our goals for the future is to create another classroom that will provide more children of Ollantaytambo the opportunity to learn and grow with us. There is a high demand from parents in the community who need a place for their children to go while they work. Right now, we are able to support the education of 29 students, but are hoping to raise this number to 45 over the next year. In order to make this happen we need to expand our staff and materials. Being a non-government organization we depend on people such as yourself who deem education a necessity in life. <br/>

<div>
<p>World Repair is an organization dedicated to creating and promoting positive change in the world.</p>
<p>This winter we're thinking about the less fortunate who will struggle with cold temperatures, hygiene concerns and lack of food.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we've decided to create care packages that we can deliver to them as gifts. </p>
</div> <p><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">The Emotional Challenges Of Living On The Streets</span><br/></p>

<p>Unfortunately, unlike most folks these individuals living on the streets don't get to find peace and comfort on these cold winter days by sharing it with their loved ones.</p>
<p>Too often these fellow human beings are faced with disgruntle looks and rejection on a daily basis. We believe this kind of behavior is counter productive on many levels and adds on to the negative feelings of despair and being neglected. </p>
<p>The campaign ""Handout A Smile"" was created to help work against this, by not only giving them things that they may need but also adding ordinary items they could appreciate; all while shaking their hands and sharing a smile.</p>

World Repair is an organization dedicated to creating and promoting positive change in the world.
This winter we're thinking about the less fortunate who will struggle with cold temperatures, hygiene concerns and lack of food.
With this in mind, we've decided to create care packages that we can deliver to them as gifts. 
 
The Emotional Challenges Of Living On The Streets


Unfortunately, unlike most folks these individuals living on the streets don't get to find peace and comfort on these cold winter days by sharing it with their loved ones.
Too often these fellow human beings are faced with disgruntle looks and rejection on a daily basis. We believe this kind of behavior is counter productive on many levels and adds on to the negative feelings of despair and being neglected. 
The campaign ""Handout A Smile"" was created to help work against this, by not only giving them things that they may need but also adding ordinary items they could appreciate; all while shaking their hands and sharing a smile.

The Build Up Process

Through our efforts, we hope to accumulate $2500 to create several care package gifts that can be brought directly to people in need of a helping hand.

With this campaign, we want You to be as involved as possible with the process of giving and sharing.
With each level of donnation you can hand pick what you would like to be included and help build the care packages. 


$5 - Magic Gloves 
       
One size fits all unisex gloves to keep warm on those chilly nights. 
$10- Warm Winter Tuque + The Gloves
                                                     
With each extra dollar you can afford to donate the more we can include in the care packages! At $10 we'll be able to add a tuque to the care package.
$25- Personalize Your Donnation!  Include An Inspiring Note. 


Write a little something special. Your favorite inspiration quote or just a short personal message of hope. Along with the gloves and tuque we'll be able to add a warm scarf and also print out your personalized message to deliver with the care packages.

Please note that if you wish to include a personalized note with this contribution you can do so by sending us a message directly on Indiegogo or by email at promote@worldrepairvisions.com

<p><span><span><span>Everyone that is pitching in now is not only helping the kids with 
cancer but the future of the world.  That's what this is y'all.  If they
 keep this law they already passed?  SB 277 forcing vaccinations on our 
kids?  The rest of America will follow along with the other rich white 
bank owned countries.  We are all so fucked if this happens.  So this is
 it folks.  D Day.  I'm on front lines.  Appreciate all the love.  If 
you can't donate money send light.</span></span></span><br/></p>
<p>My name is Ian Jacklin and I'm
 not going to take it anymore!  I was already pissed off when I found 
out that although I know how to cure cancer thanks to making my last 
film ""iCureCancer.com""...  yet, I'm not allowed to use that kind of 
medicine on my own children?  I want all children to be free of the 
tyranny of the Nazi government trying to take over America.  So I'm 
picking up my camera, since I can't use a gun...  to capture the truths 
and spread the truths in order to save what freedom we have.  <br/></p>
<p>As many of you know I never got any kind of sizable investment last time and we fell way short of goal so here we go again.  Especially because:<br/></p>
<p>When
 I found out that California Governor Pan and Brown both took bribes, 
not to mention ""legally"" financially benefiting from passing the Nazi 
law in to place...   I snapped on my religious friends.  lol.  I blamed 
them at first.  lol.  Sorry guys.  But I had to let off steam and get 
everyone riled up for this.  We have to recall Senator Pan in Northern 
California and support the referendum of Jerry Brown and SB 277...  
Or... We are done!</p>
<p>It 
is not only un-American; it is murder.  The Gardasil vaccine will be 
murdering 1 in 912 girls next year if California imposes this law!  If 
this happens I wash my hands of the USA and free world and go 
underground.  So this is my last ditch effort to help humanity.  Please 
help me keep gas in my Jeep and food in my belly while I continue across
 this country with my camera from Mexico to Canada this summer visiting 
different folks to interview for my film along the way.  I have decided 
to make iCureCancer2 - Baby Killers include the vaccination horror show 
going on right now in America.  Califuckenfornia of all places?  Does 
Nazi Germany ring a bell at all folks?  They will be injecting your 
children without your say next year!  One in 912 girls will die from 
Gardasil alone and that vaccine does nothing for them!  Vaccines are a 
myth!  A total myth by Big Pharma.  End of story.  Follow the money 
trail.</p>
<p>If you too are sick 
and tired and don't want to take it anymore then support me.  Help me 
help you.  I was able to get from Tijuana to Northern California thanks 
to donations.  I need to get back and forth from Mexico and then across 
to the East Coast and up to Canada and back.  This trip will only cost 
gas and lodgings for me.  I can shoot and edit myself on the way and you
 will see my progress in youtube video's.  I will eventually have ""Baby 
Killers"" in the can and edited to continue our revolution to wake people
 up.  I mean this is our children folks.  Fuck the pink!  ACS (""American
 Cancer Society"") is bullshit.  Donate here to a real cause.  If nothing
 else we get a ton of great information on youtube.  And in time, an 
amazing award winning film.  Baby Killers.  The name will go down in 
history.  Mark my words.  They fucked up.</p>
<p>So
 needless to say, my thanks to each and everyone one of you that has my 
back!!!  I send back a million fold in warrior light.  They say I have 
Arch Angel Raphael in me.  So for whatever that's worth...  Love and 
light all around!</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>An executive producer.  The plan is to take my Jeep to Montana, where my 
good friend and old producer of my yesteryear films, Fred Stallone, has a
 Ford Truck Conversion waiting for me.  He is chipping in for some gas 
and we are hoping the rest can be raised on here. Only 5 an a bit of the origninal 20 was raised so we are trying again.  $37,000 
is enough to make sure I survive on the road and have a little to get 
the post production rolling with.  We want the film out ASAP to go with 
the vaccine murders they are about to force on Cali mothers.  </p>
<p>Again,
 the movie is coming out in chunks anyway on youtube for those that want
 to subscribe!  Make sure you follow me on facebook:  gijacklin and on <a href=""http://youtube.com/icurecancer2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">youtube.com/icurecancer2</a>
 and the icurecancer group on facebook etc....  <br/></p>
<p>Thank you so much!  </p>

</div></div>","Everyone that is pitching in now is not only helping the kids with 
cancer but the future of the world.  That's what this is y'all.  If they
 keep this law they already passed?  SB 277 forcing vaccinations on our 
kids?  The rest of America will follow along with the other rich white 
bank owned countries.  We are all so fucked if this happens.  So this is
 it folks.  D Day.  I'm on front lines.  Appreciate all the love.  If 
you can't donate money send light.
My name is Ian Jacklin and I'm
 not going to take it anymore!  I was already pissed off when I found 
out that although I know how to cure cancer thanks to making my last 
film ""iCureCancer.com""...  yet, I'm not allowed to use that kind of 
medicine on my own children?  I want all children to be free of the 
tyranny of the Nazi government trying to take over America.  So I'm 
picking up my camera, since I can't use a gun...  to capture the truths 
and spread the truths in order to save what freedom we have.  
As many of you know I never got any kind of sizable investment last time and we fell way short of goal so here we go again.  Especially because:
When
 I found out that California Governor Pan and Brown both took bribes, 
not to mention ""legally"" financially benefiting from passing the Nazi 
law in to place...   I snapped on my religious friends.  lol.  I blamed 
them at first.  lol.  Sorry guys.  But I had to let off steam and get 
everyone riled up for this.  We have to recall Senator Pan in Northern 
California and support the referendum of Jerry Brown and SB 277...  
Or... We are done!
It 
is not only un-American; it is murder.  The Gardasil vaccine will be 
murdering 1 in 912 girls next year if California imposes this law!  If 
this happens I wash my hands of the USA and free world and go 
underground.  So this is my last ditch effort to help humanity.  Please 
help me keep gas in my Jeep and food in my belly while I continue across
 this country with my camera from Mexico to Canada this summer visiting 
different folks to interview for my film along the way.  I have decided 
to make iCureCancer2 - Baby Killers include the vaccination horror show 
going on right now in America.  Califuckenfornia of all places?  Does 
Nazi Germany ring a bell at all folks?  They will be injecting your 
children without your say next year!  One in 912 girls will die from

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>To offer yoga playdates at parks, beaches, makerts, community events and festivals is a great way to share peaceful, mindful and playful moments with families and bring more love and joy in this world. It allows people to stop and connect where they are, rather than asking them to commit and drive to a yoga studio. It makes it accessible to everyone, together. </p>
<p>Since I completed the Rainbow Kids Yoga Teacher Training in 2013, I have been struggling working odd side jobs in order to get the yoga project started. The projects are flowing and I need to move forward, register the business and get organized to rock these little yogis' summer!</p>
<p>In order to share the essence of my work, I created the website <i>Peace. Love. Yoga. </i>in February 2017, in hope this will be helpful for parents, educators, teachers, kids yoga teachers, peacebuilders, changemakers, leaders, and most of all, kids, to be part of <i>the change we wish to see in this world.</i></p>

Bio - Leelou completed a bachelor degree in Education (2011) and a short program in Kid’s Literature (2012) at Université du Québec à Trois-Rivières, a Reiki certification (levels 1 & 2) with Reiki Samasati school in San Cristobal de las Casas, Mexico (2013), and the Rainbow Kids Yoga Teacher Training in Montreal (2013). She became Ambassador of Nutopia in June 2009, when visting Yoko Ono's mind-blowing, heart-melting exhibition in Montreal: IMAGINE: The Peace Ballad of John and Yoko. She visited alternative schools in Québec, France and Belgium, cultivating a passion for self-directed education and connected learning movements, yoga and mindfulness for children and families.
In the past ten years, she worked and volunteered with children from different cultures, countries and mother tongue,  in various environments such as schools, daycares, French Immersion programs, outdoor base camps, community events, festivals, etc. Since she moved to the Okanagan in 2014, she shared rainbow yoga love and joy at Apex Moutain Resort daycare, Jumping Beans Play Café, Naramata Community Market, Naramata Playschool, and more. She created the Website Peace. Love. Yoga. to support her work and as contribution to make this world a better place.
She launched this IndieGoGo campaign to support her work and move forward with business registrations, insurances and other expenses to get started properly and share more rainbow yoga love Online and in her community.

The Impact
To offer yoga playdates at parks, beaches, makerts, community events and festivals is a great way to share peaceful, mindful and playful moments with families and bring more love and joy in this world. It allows people to stop and connect where they are, rather than asking them to commit and drive to a yoga studio. It makes it accessible to everyone, together. 
Since I completed the Rainbow Kids Yoga Teacher Training in 2013, I have been struggling working odd side jobs in order to get the yoga project started. The projects are flowing and I need to move forward, register the business and get organized to rock these little yogis' summer!
In order to share the essence of my work, I created the website Peace. Love. Yoga. in February 2017, in hope this will be helpful for parents, educators, teachers, kids yoga teachers, peacebuilders, changemakers, leaders, and most of all, kids, to be part of the change we wish to see in this world.
 

Risks & Challenges
Risk: make this world a better place.
Challenges: naysayers.
Plan for solving these challenges: keep on believing.
