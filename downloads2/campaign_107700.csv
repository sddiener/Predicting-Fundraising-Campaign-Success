<h3>Story:</h3>
<p>Hi everyone! My name is Nikki Hudgens and I’m a graduate student in Loyola Marymount University's Writing and Producing for Television MFA. I also need your help to make the sizzle reel for my half-hour dark comedy series—So Fucking Funny- a reality.</p>
<p>So Fucking Funny is told through the stand-up of Jules “AfroDite” Carter,  the queen of 70s comedy porn who regains full-custody of her estranged son after her mother’s untimely death, just as she ages out of the industry.</p>
<p>This project is gritty, raunchy and unapologetically flawed, just like Jules and I can’t wait to share her story with you; it’s unlike anything you’ve ever seen, I assure you. My goal is to raise five thousand dollars; if you donate a hundred dollars or more you will receive a So Fucking Funny T-Shirt and donors of fifty dollars or more will receive a So Fucking Funny Poster, though all donations are much needed and very much appreciated.  </p>
<p>Thank you for giving a few of your hard-earned coins to my humble little comedy—it will make a massive impact. Thanks again! Peace. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where the Money Goes:</h3>
<p>Your donations help fund location rentals, crew equipment, craft services, elements of production design, <i>amazing</i> actors and so much of the key aspects it takes to make a killer piece a reality. Thank you in advance for your kind contributions!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our last campaign reached 110% of our goal and helped us get our pilot episode ""Celestial Misconduct"" seen in film festivals all across the country, and there are still many festivals to go. It's been an incredibly exciting run so far and we can't thank those who donated to our initial campaign enough. </p>
<p>But, we want to keep going. The exploits of Donovan Mulray are far from over. There is so much more story to tell, you won't be disappointed.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are asking for $5000 to make ""Celestial Orientation."" This modest budget will go a long way in securing locations, actors and making our post production go smoothly.</p>
<p>This is a more ambitious production than our pilot episode. More characters, locations, and special effects. It's a much bigger story that we are about to tell which is both very exciting and just a bit daunting. Even if we don't make our goal, we can make use of any assistance you are able to offer, be it just $5 or $10. Anything helps, and we will love you forever and always.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With the success of ""Celestial Misconduct"" we have become emboldened as filmmakers to continue to tell our unique brand of stories.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">SYNOPSIS</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>When manipulating sociopath, Alex, checks himself into the same rehab as Haylee, his fag-hag best friend that he pinned a crime on, it’s going to take a lot of blackmailing in order for her to not only forgive him, but to also help find a way to pay off the crack-crazed drug dealer that awaits them both on the outside. The two friends will be forced to confront if their friendship can survive their personal addictions and the separate ways in which they’re attempting to deny them. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, dealing with the hidden abuse of his relationship, Carter prepares himself for an audition into a creative arts school... as a drag queen. Unaware of where this world may eventually take him, Carter's naivety may come at a cost far greater than anyone else's. Meanwhile, Jake uses his authority as a police officer to take his internalised anger out on those around him without consequence. But for how long can someone keep up the act of protect and serve when he's already abusing the ones that he claims to love?<br/> </p>

<p>Is addiction stronger than love, or is love simply another addiction?<br/><br/>This is a question that has followed me around for most of my life. Was I truly in love with the ones that seemed to hurt me most, or was I just addicted to the feelings only they could seemingly provide? Why did some of my friends fall down the rabbit hole and never return? Did I ever really return?</p>
<p>My story is somewhat universal, but the specifics are where it gets a <i>little</i> dangerous.</p>
<p>I'm not the first to fall in love and I'm not the last to have had my heart broken...but have you ever had a police officer, going through a meth rage, demand that you come and meet him out on the street or be forced to deal with the consequences of him putting a bullet into his skull...all the while telling you how much he loved you?  An abuse of power that went down a far darker path than I could have imagined...<br/><br/>Have you had your head bashed in and been left for dead, your closest friends being too lost in a sea of parties, drugs and semen (gross, but fair) to be able to come and check on you?<br/><br/>It took me leaving the country and fleeing from all of my 'addictions' to clearly see what was right and wrong for me...and even over there I was still a deeply flawed human being, but it should make for some fascinating television.</p>
<p>'COMMITTED' is an extremely raw and personal story about my life, my friends, my enemies, our addictions, and all the dramas that unfolded around us.  (Yes, I was responsible for a lot of them). The story of four lives, all connected through the worst of ways, doing their best to stay alive and to stay addicted without consequence.</p>

<h3>Sumário</h3>
<p>SANTY PONTO COM,  uma comédia pura, conta a história de Santiago, um jovem de 16 anos, completamente desajustado à realidade. Santiago é expulso, por equívoco, do colégio extremamente elitista onde estudou a vida inteira, após ter sido acusado de ter explodido a casa de banho.  Lara, mãe de Santiago decide que é altura de fazer o seu filho crescer e coloca-o numa escola pública, uma experiência que se revelará inédita para Santiago. É nesta escola que a realidade de Santiago e o mundo real colidem. Após uma breve pesquisa de “como ser fixe” o nosso protagonista descobre que a melhor maneira é ingressar num grupo e decide então juntar-se ao clube de futsal da escola sem nunca ter praticado qualquer tipo de desporto. Santiago acaba por ficar na equipa após o seu treinador que é uma espécie de Mister Miyagi ver nele um potencial oculto e a solução para os problemas da equipa. Santy.com é o blogue onde Santiago partilha com o mundo as suas aventuras e os seus pensamentos mais estranhos.</p>

SANTY PONTO COM,  uma comédia pura, conta a história de Santiago, um jovem de 16 anos, completamente desajustado à realidade. Santiago é expulso, por equívoco, do colégio extremamente elitista onde estudou a vida inteira, após ter sido acusado de ter explodido a casa de banho.  Lara, mãe de Santiago decide que é altura de fazer o seu filho crescer e coloca-o numa escola pública, uma experiência que se revelará inédita para Santiago. É nesta escola que a realidade de Santiago e o mundo real colidem. Após uma breve pesquisa de “como ser fixe” o nosso protagonista descobre que a melhor maneira é ingressar num grupo e decide então juntar-se ao clube de futsal da escola sem nunca ter praticado qualquer tipo de desporto. Santiago acaba por ficar na equipa após o seu treinador que é uma espécie de Mister Miyagi ver nele um potencial oculto e a solução para os problemas da equipa. Santy.com é o blogue onde Santiago partilha com o mundo as suas aventuras e os seus pensamentos mais estranhos.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Chapstick Web Series, a comedic LGBTQ series that is trying to come back for a second season. We loved creating the first season and seeing the response we received. We can't wait to get back to work, creating Season 2 of Chapstick Web Series.</p>
<p>Chapstick follows the lives of two best friends, Marlo and Addy, and their daily struggles of being artists, being women, liking women, and finding their place in this vast world. Fans have described the show as a ""gay Broad City"" and we were so blown away that someone would ever reference us to those queens!</p>
<p>Chapstick has been featured in publications such as: VICE, Curve Magazine, Snobby Robot, Study Breaks, LOTL, The Columbia Chronicle, and ScriptMag.</p>
<p>Chapstick Web Series was created by myself, Charlotte Kennett, and my co- creator, Kearney Fagan. Both Kearney and myself were Comedy Writing &amp; Performance majors at Columbia College Chicago. We love to create comedic content, especially for the community we so strongly identify with: LGBTQ.</p>
<p>Kearney and myself always cast LGBTQ people in LGBTQ roles, we also try our best to crew our sets with as many LGBTQ people, females, and POC. We strive to give opportunities to the marginalized. When you invest in Chapstick you are investing in opportunities for LGBTQ people, females, and POC. </p>
<p>We are launching this Indiegogo campaign to raise<strong> $1800 </strong>dollars. We need this money in order to create Season 2. Without it... we won't have a show that we feel good about.</p>
<p>We did the math (believe it or not) ... and IF every single one of our subscribers donates <strong>$1 </strong>we will reach our goal. </p>
<p>If YOU donate <strong>$1 </strong>we will have a Season 2 of Chapstick Web Series.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise<strong> $1800</strong> in order to create Season 2 of Chapstick Web Series.</li>
<li>WHERE THE MONEY IS GOING: <strong>Equipment, Set Dec, Costumes, Food, and Locations.</strong>
</li>
<li>We have some awesome perks for you to check out... A dinner with the creators, a personalized postcard, or an autographed copy of your favorite script.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal, the funds will still be put towards a show. We just might have less episodes in a Season due to lack of funding. So instead of a 10 or 12 episode season we might have a 6 or 8 episode season.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will be the difference between having a second season of Chapstick and not having a second season. Your donation of $1 (or more) goes a long way. Any way you can contribute to this campaign WILL HELP.</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapstick is an important show for the world because the subject matter that we focus on needs more attention. We need to keep creating media for everyone, and that includes the LGBTQ community.</li>
<li>We have over 100,000 views on Youtube for Season 1! We think that's pretty great. It's clear that the show got a good reception and we are ready to create more content for our subscribers/ viewers.</li>
<li>Chapstick was created by two LGBTQ female filmmakers from Chicago. We love this show so much. We are so pleased to see that it has affected the community in a positive way. Any way we can strengthen the LGBTQ community is a good way. </li>
<li>In general: more comedic content needs to be created for LGBTQ people. We need to have accurate representations in television.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always risks in creating comedic television, especially when it pertains to LGBTQ culture. The creators and the producers of this show take the task of creating a vulnerable and valid show very seriously. We promise that every episode is fully thought out and conscious of our viewers and the community.</p>
<p>We also risk not being able to create a second season if we can't reach our funding goal. Unfortunately, filming a web series takes time and money. We really want to be able to give our viewers high quality content and if we can't do it right: <strong>we don't want to do it at all.</strong></p>
<p>Help us reach our goal and overcome the obstacles! If we fund hard we can make sure that season 2 happens!</p>

<p>Just because YOU can't donate DOESN'T mean you can't help us out.</p>

<p>FrankenSITTER is an upcoming spooky, family-friendly web series being filmed July 2018 in Memphis, TN.</p>
<p>The story begins on Halloween night when a group of outcasts accidentally kill their babysitter. Using science and magic, they devise a plan and successfully bring her back to life…But the the plan only partially works: She is back with the living, but the kids notice something VERY different about her. She has changed into what we can only describe as something incredibly spooky.</p>
<p>In each 10-minute episode, the kids hope to fix their mistake only to discover that each time, Sam’s personality changes into something completely unexpected. One episode she might believe she is a zany 50s housewife, while in the next she becomes the world’s most powerful villain.</p>
<p>Every character the babysitter becomes throughout the series taps into a deep fear from one of the kids in the group. With teamwork, bravery and a lot of creativity, the friends overcome and stand up to each manifestation.</p>
<p>With a fun and spooky twist at the end, we hope to make you laugh, cry, and leave feeling like you are not alone in this world.</p>

We have fun and spooky FrankenSITTER merchandise including stickers, T-shirts, hats, and more! Including signed posters, designed by comic book artist Ioannis Roumpoulias, and genuine screen and IMDB credits, so you can SEE and be forever credited for your impact in bringing FrankenSITTER to life. 


Without reaching our entire goal, the project will be very limited in what we can offer our aspiring artists. We do not want to compromise or limit the professionalism in their first industry experience and exposure, so every little bit helps!

</div></div>","Overview
We're a couple of filmmakers and producers out of Texas, now living in LA. After college, we decided to make our own content. 
DirtyWorks presents its newest limited web series of action packed comedic drama about intelligence, betrayal, and conquering fear. Nate, a junior private investigator, must prove he can fight organized crime without knowing where his friends stand and where the enemy lies.
""The Applicant"" is our latest series and if we reach our goal, we want to reward our viewers with not just the completed project, but the perks of achieving something just as we have.
This campaign centers around bringing DirtyWorks to the next level and expanding our future projects to the realm of great quality.

What We Need & What You Get
We need $2500 to pay for all the expenses below. This will really help the next episodes shine.
And if we don't reach our goal (we will), we'll still be able to crank out the final episodes with whatever donations we receive!


 
Ultimately, your coin might be contributed for anything from costumes and makeup to our lighting equipment, to paying our wonderful crew or to even feeding us while we work! 
So... we set up a cool little rewards system that we think everyone will enjoy. And, we'll make sure to reach out to everyone who qualified for those perks, so make sure you give us your name so we can get your contact info later.
Otherwise, we understand if you're not interested in the perk or would just simply like to remain anonymous to forego contact and are equally as grateful for your donation!
The Impact
The Applicant series is the next step in taking DirtyWorks to the level we want to reach.
We've made full episodes (icons next to our campaign video) and even a whole season of a show without any funding before.
Here's an example:

 
That's just what we can do with no budget and a tape recorder. So if we're being honest, just imagine what we can do with some real production budget!
 

Risks & Challenges
The filming process sometimes takes weeks, so you won't be able to see the great results your donations will bring immediately.
Your donations go a lot further than you think, no matter what you're contributing. Donating is ultimately an investment, and sometimes that investment may fall short.
But we guarantee that all of our funding will be worth every penny and each backer will receive our utmost thanks and appreciation. Without you, we wouldn't be already where we want to be!
However, we plan on giving you guys content along the campaign to keep you ready and entertained (Just check out our sick rewards)!

Other Ways You Can Help
Whether your donation is $5 or $500, you spreading the word is worth more than any dollar amount. 
So share, share, share!
Remember to use the Indiegogo share tools and spread the word on all social media platforms if you can!

<p>Destination Celebration began as an original idea from the wild mind of Kyle LaMontagne. In 2016 Kyle produced, directed and hosted three episodes of Destination Celebration, a show where he journeyed to exotic countries and had cool, and sometimes hair-raising, adventures on his way to one of the country's iconic festivals.</p>
<p>That limited release won Destination Celebration a Southwest Regional Emmy for best Lifestyle Series.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528302987/jhssh2cmo2jm4v3amvkj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>For the next year, while working his day job in film production, Kyle honed his idea and asked his filmmaker sister Maddy to bring her creative fire to the project and the concept of a wise-ass brother and sister combo adventure road-tripping to crazy festivals while immersing themselves in the wonder of the planet's peoples and cultures fell into place.</p>

<p>Hey, everyone, we're Maddy and Kyle LaMontagne and our aim is to produce a network quality adventure travel series that we'll package and pitch to Cable channels, conventional networks and streaming services like Netflix, Amazon and Sony's.</p>
<p>This Indiegogo campaign will help fund both the first episode of Destination Celebration and a wide marketing campaign that includes select film festivals and pitching to sponsors and investors.</p>
<p>In the pilot episode, we'll land in magnificent Barcelona, Spain, our destination the Tomatina Festival in the mountain village of Bunol. In Barcelona, crazy Spaniard Gonzo will give us a tutorial on how to negotiate authentic Spanish tapas bars and the rollicking Catalan club scene before we all head down the rugged Mediterranean coast for more adventure.</p>
<p>After exploring the Valencia street art scene, secret beaches and a bull leaping competition-- the recently revived ancient, cruelty free version of bullfighting,--we turn east to the mountain village of Bunol.</p>
<p>A town of 9,000 people, Bunol welcomes an additional 20,000 revelers for a three day street party that culminates in a town-wide free-for-all tomato fight, <strong>La Tomatina</strong>.</p>

<p>In each episode we'll be joined by area natives who share secrets of their locales. And every show will feature an animated map of our route and tips on hostels, eateries and opportunities for adventure.</p>
<p>Our plan is to package this episode--our proof-of-concept--along with a business plan and the conceptual synopses for six to eight subsequent episodes and then go wide with it pitching to cable, network and streaming channels; hitting the festival circuit and, at the same time, self-distributing it as a web-series. <i><strong>S</strong><strong>o, yes, you'll be able to see the shows no matter what!</strong></i></p>

<p>Because we love adventure and we love to travel.</p>
<p>We believe that celebrations and festivals are the most vibrant expression of a country's unique culture. For a few days, or even hours, each year, a festival creates a window into a country's past, showing us traditions that have been celebrated for sometimes hundreds, or even thousands of years.</p>
<p>In the end, what travel has shown us is that, despite our outward differences, human beings are surprisingly the same when it comes to what we value and honor. Above all, this is the  underlying theme of Destination Celebration.</p>

Jessica can’t seem to escape them or find any answers, so she uses these nightmares as inspiration for her writing. After she enters a short story “Before She Was” in a national high school story competition, she unexpectedly wins.

Forming in January 2020, we came together as a committed and passionate team with a multitude of strengths and perspectives that can bring this production to life. ‘Before She Was” is a coming-of-age psychological thriller television series that was written and conceptualized by our very own writer and producer, Deni Valchev and Sharla Sidon. We’re so excited to share this project with the world, but we can not bring it to fruition without your support.Please read on to learn more about our project!  Jessica Wilson’s life isn’t all that bad. She lives in a small town called Maplewood with her loving parents and has a great group of friends. However, something’s been off - she sees images of a strange man while she sleeps and is constantly being taken over by her nightmares. Jessica can’t seem to escape them or find any answers, so she uses these nightmares as inspiration for her writing. After she enters a short story “Before She Was” in a national high school story competition, she unexpectedly wins. As the local news channel broadcasts her achievement, things take a turn when a troubled man named Ronnie Jackson drops everything to find the girl he’s been trying to hunt down for years.Teaser 1: The Making of Before She Was:

 
 Inspiring from the cinematic works of Fincher and Villenueve, this series’ naturalistic cinematography treads the line between upbeat teen shows and dark thrillers, immersing the audience in the turbulent world of Jessica’s new reality. Focusing on perspective and movement, the camera is an omnipotent character in every scene, capturing the drama unfolding before the lens in the most human way possible. Tech Specs:A-Cam: Arri Amira with Sony CineAltasB-Cam: Blackmagic Pocket 4K with Sigma Arts   Sharla Sidon (Producer)Sharla is the producer and co-creator for Before She Was. She has  over 5 years experience working on several productions for television,  film and commercial behind and in front of the camera. She prides  herself on bringing a positive and creative energy to every project she tackles. With a passion for storytelling, she enjoys taking stories and bringing them to life.“I am so excited for everyone to see this story come to life. I have been with it from A to Z, and I am so fortunate to have had Deni turn my concept into a captivating story that the audience will enjoy.”  Deni Valchev (Writer & Co-Producer)Deni is the writer and co-producer of Before She Was. He's passionate about producing and the business and legal aspects of the entertainment industry. He's excited for audiences to dive into the story and its multifaceted characters. “I’ll tell you truthfully that writing this story has presented a lot of creative challenges for me. Being a pilot, I found that there needs to be a healthy mix of grabbing the audience's attention, but also being careful not to reveal what’s to come for the rest of the season.I’m forever grateful that my story was chosen to get produced. I’ve always wanted to write a psychological thriller and when I heard Sharla’s idea, I knew I could expand it into a whole world filled with twists and turns. I’m passionate about producing the story because the characters all have so much history to uncover about others and even themselves. I’ve put in an awesome cliff hanger and can’t wait to get audiences excited about the next episode and the season to come!”  Parnika Raj (Director)Parnika is passionate about telling stories not traditionally told. She has been honing her skills by being a part of various music videos, web series, commercials and other projects throughout her RTA career. She is very excited to put those skills and experiences to work on Before She Was. “Telling stories that aren't traditionally told and giving opportunities to people who don’t usually get them are things I keep in mind while directing. We are very strong in having a BIPOC lead and mixed cast in order to honour this philosophy.”   Philip LeMoyne (Cinematographer)Philip LeMoyne is a Montreal-born cinematographer with 17 credits to his name on major productions, with an overall focus on dramatic narratives. Having committed the past eight years to the creation of moving images, recent accolades include Excellence in Cinematography at Buffer Festival 2019 for his role as Director of Photography on Émile Roy's ""My Life is Scripted"" (FR: J'écris ma vie), as well as the 2020 William F.

<h3>The Show</h3>
<p>The fellowship between a group of obsessive Live Action Role Players (LARPers) is broken when a player rises up against their tyrannical leader. With the declaration of war, their fantasy exploits begin to seep into their everyday lives. No nine-to-five office space is safe.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Characters</h3>
<p>LORELAI: Protagonist. Charming and spunky with an unwavering, intimidating degree of confidence. She’s always ready for battle, whether it be in the form of hand-to-hand combat or shutting down ignorant idiots.</p>
<p>AIDAN: The world builder. Stubborn and dramatic. He believes that he has surpassed the geniuses of JRR Tolkein and George RR Martin combined and will tell you so...in one of the eight functional languages he developed himself. Endearing, but kind of an asshole.</p>
<p>SARAH: Meek and mousy by day, noble and powerful in character. She finds her voice in the game. She has a passion for storytelling and yearns to one day reach Aidan’s level of “genius”. Vastly underestimated.</p>
<p>MICHAEL: A stocky yet docile man. Despite being on the local police force he resigns himself to the role of a humble potter. He LARPs not for the battle, but for the friendship.</p>
<p>ARTHUR: Lorelai’s boss. No funny business. Anti make-believe, pro historical reenactment.</p>

<h3><u>The Imagination that led to Imagine PD</u></h3>
<p>Like many great TV shows, Imagine PD came to fruition while creator, Mai Linh, was sitting in LA traffic. As she glanced at the people in the cars around her, she began to imagine a world where they all had their Imaginary Friends in the passenger seats -- someone to talk to when life got slow. One thing led to another, and Eric Ford and his pal Duke were born. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>Eric, Duke and the Funky Bunch</u></h3>
<p><i><strong>The Party Just Get's Better With More Characters</strong></i></p>
<p><u><i>Detective Sally ""Sal"" Kieu - Eric's ball busting partner.</i></u></p>
<p>Sal is intense, hard to please, and begrudgingly works with Eric. Despite his obvious personality shortcomings, Sal knows she's partnered with the best of the best and puts up with his idiocracies because... Well, hell.  Because he makes her look sane. Completely without her knowledge, Sal's childhood imaginary friend, Princess Pony, reappears alongside Duke -- but only Eric can see and hear them.</p>
<p><u><i>Princess Pony - Sal's edgy, doe-eyed imaginary  best friend.</i></u></p>
<p>Princess Pony is a bright, innocent, and sometimes wry contrast that has haunted Sal since childhood. She desperately tries to get Sal to soften up and to be kinder to her fellow human beings. The only problem -- After the age of 7, Sal doesn't know that Princess Pony still exists. </p>
<p><u><i>Detective Harold ""Smitty"" Smith - Beloved by all. Hated by Eric.</i></u></p>
<p>Smitty is the precinct's boy scout.  Not only does he serve the badge with his quick wit and irresistable charm, he also serves the community by volunteering his heart out for any cause possible.  Your grandma loves him, the gangbangers who are carjacking you LOVE him, and even Sal tolerates him moderately!  Which is all the reason why Eric can't stand the guy.  The office rivalry between the King of OCD and Prince of Boyish Charm is going to be one for the books at Imagine PD.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>The Heart of The Story</u></h3>
<p><i><strong>This Show Is Really About The People That We Wish We Could Be</strong></i></p>
<p>Eric Ford is a stiff, by-the-book rule follower. He gets lost in his drive for order and justice that he never learns how to enjoy the little things that life has to offer.</p>
<p>Enter: Duke.  The loud, unrestrained imaginary best friend that never hesitates before speaking his mind.  Duke does what he wants and when he wants it.  He irritates Eric endlessly, but is exactly what Eric needs... and really, what Eric wishes HE himself could be -- after all, Duke manifested from his childhood subconscious.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>What Happens Once the Pilot is Shot</u></h3>
<p>After we shoot this pilot, with your generous help, it will be submitted to film and television festivals, Pilot competitions, agents, and producers. We feel that we really have something charming and wonderful here, and we will launch it full force at the world. </p>
<p>It won't be available for public viewing for quite some time after we finish shooting and editing, which is why YOU should contribute at a perk level that gets you early viewing! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>Where is Your Money Going?</u></h3>
<p>Making an episode of television requires a ton of people, costumes, sets, equipment, etc. </p>
<ul>
<li>Our pilot is SAG, which means it is protected by the actors' union. We love the union because it makes sure actors get paid accordingly for their work! We, in turn, must pay our actors at least SAG minimum for their work with us. </li>
<li>We have to pay a Director, a Director of Photography and a whole camera crew for him or her, Makeup Artists, Wardrobe people, and so much more. It is exciting to ensure that people in this industry really are getting paid for their special talents!</li>
<li>We have to pay for locations. Renting spaces, building small set pieces, and filling out the sets with props is all coming out of your contributions. </li>
<li>Food! We have to feed our cast and crew each day of filming. Full tummies make for great television. Gandhi said that, I think. </li>
</ul>
<p>We have designed perks that we hope get you excited about getting involved. This is a team effort!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>What if we don't reach our goal?</u></h3>
<p>If we don't make it all the way, we will accomodate accordingly. This amount really is what we need to make a quality episode that has a shot at getting picked up by a network, but IF we don't reach our goal, we will still work hard to make either a minisode or a webseries for you. You will still get to find out what happens to Eric and Co., no matter what!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></h3>
<p>The hardest part of this show is that it involves realistic Police characters, sets, and situations. When we shot our trailer, we already had to overcome a few hurdles and learned a lot about how we can make it as authentic as possible. </p>
<ul>
<li>We had a retired Policeman on set as a consultant. He made sure Eric and Sal's uniforms were authentically correct and taught them the proper footwork and gun handling for entering a dangerous scenario</li>
<li>We got permits for the use of fake weapons</li>
<li>We secured the use of a set that looked like an authentic setting for a crime scene</li>
</ul>
<p>As we shoot the pilot, we will continue to take every necessary step to keep our show as authentic as possible. </p>
<p> </p>

<p>If you can't contribute, we understand! Here are some ways you can still help:</p>

Eric Ford is a stiff, by-the-book rule follower. He gets lost in his drive for order and justice that he never learns how to enjoy the little things that life has to offer.
Enter: Duke.  The loud, unrestrained imaginary best friend that never hesitates before speaking his mind.  Duke does what he wants and when he wants it.  He irritates Eric endlessly, but is exactly what Eric needs... and really, what Eric wishes HE himself could be -- after all, Duke manifested from his childhood subconscious.
 
What Happens Once the Pilot is Shot
After we shoot this pilot, with your generous help, it will be submitted to film and television festivals, Pilot competitions, agents, and producers. We feel that we really have something charming and wonderful here, and we will launch it full force at the world. 
It won't be available for public viewing for quite some time after we finish shooting and editing, which is why YOU should contribute at a perk level that gets you early viewing! 
 

Where is Your Money Going?
Making an episode of television requires a ton of people, costumes, sets, equipment, etc. 

Our pilot is SAG, which means it is protected by the actors' union. We love the union because it makes sure actors get paid accordingly for their work! We, in turn, must pay our actors at least SAG minimum for their work with us. 
We have to pay a Director, a Director of Photography and a whole camera crew for him or her, Makeup Artists, Wardrobe people, and so much more. It is exciting to ensure that people in this industry really are getting paid for their special talents!
We have to pay for locations. Renting spaces, building small set pieces, and filling out the sets with props is all coming out of your contributions. 
Food! We have to feed our cast and crew each day of filming. Full tummies make for great television. Gandhi said that, I think. 

We have designed perks that we hope get you excited about getting involved. This is a team effort!
 
What if we don't reach our goal?
If we don't make it all the way, we will accomodate accordingly. This amount really is what we need to make a quality episode that has a shot at getting picked up by a network, but IF we don't reach our goal, we will still work hard to make either a minisode or a webseries for you. You will still get to find out what happens to Eric and Co., no matter what!
 

Risks & Challenges
The hardest part of this show is that it involves realistic Police characters, sets, and situations. When we shot our trailer, we already had to overcome a few hurdles and learned a lot about how we can make it as authentic as possible. 

We had a retired Policeman on set as a consultant. He made sure Eric and Sal's uniforms were authentically correct and taught them the proper footwork and gun handling for entering a dangerous scenario
We got permits for the use of fake weapons
We secured the use of a set that looked like an authentic setting for a crime scene

As we shoot the pilot, we will continue to take every necessary step to keep our show as authentic as possible.

<p><strong>Summary and Impact:</strong></p>
<p>My name is Lisa D. Adams, Seed Sowing Maven, I am an award winning author, filmmaker, actor, and most importantly a youth leader. Help Me Help Son the Documentary was originated by the request of an American American mom seeking books for her African American son. Although I did not have a book specified for the well-being of African American young men, her zeal and command conceived the birth of Help Me Help My Son. </p>
<p>As a parent and grandparent of African American boys, I have made mistakes. I do not claim to have all the answers but I am committed to establishing better relationships. It is important to allow our youth to voice their concerns. How else can we resolve the problem unless we address the root which entails the stigmatism of expressing emotions as a sign of weakness, lack of communication, and the feeling of being unheard. </p>
<p>Help Me Help My Son the documentary has segue into a multi series of episodes titled Help Me Help My Son the Ongoing Conversation. The variety of episodes will open lines of communications that were once considered as a barrier. The goal of this venture is to create a healthier dialogue and ultimately break risky cycles and bring awareness while providing solutions.</p>

</div></div>","About Gay Accent

I'm a very gay boy who has dealt with depression for most of his life--luckily I also write and act! So I decided to create something funny about the struggle of pursuing your dreams whilst dealing with mental illness.
We've made it to the final stages of the project, and we're ready to pop this gayby out for the world to see, but we have to get the sound fixed up first.
By contributing to this project, you will help us wrap post-production and get the project posted online, as well as submitted to festivals.


What We Need & What You Get

We only need $500, which will go straight to the sound edit!
$5 gets you a personalized thank you email!
$10 gets you a thank you email, and a shoutout in the credits of an episode!
$25 gets you above prizes, and a link to the episodes before they premiere!
$50 gets you above prizes, and a producer credit!
If you donate $100 or more, you will get all of the above plus a special Gay Accent t-shirt!
Whether you're an artist yourself or not, this is a chance for you to be apart of creating something!


Risks & Challenges

If we don't reach our goal, the money we do get would still go towards the sound edit and I'll just have to figure out another way to pay my rent...
But we're going to reach the goal! Since I announced this web series, I've received so much moral support, and felt the excitement of family and friends. I know we can reach the finish line together.

<h3>Now it's time to <i>talk shop</i>...</h3>
<p>I'm Karen Joseph Adcock, a third year MFA student in Loyola Marymount University's Television Writing and Producing Program. <strong>Talking Shop</strong> is my graduate thesis project. I’m hoping to raise $5,000 to fund production and post-production for the first two episodes of this digital series.</p>
<p><strong>Talking Shop</strong> is a project that’s incredibly special to me and has been a long time coming. It follows Leslie Thompson, a 40-something beauty salon owner whose shop and presence are both staples in her neighborhood. The season takes place over the course of one day, and each episode focuses on a woman or girl who comes to the shop for an appointment. As we learn about the women in her chair, we also learn more about Leslie, where she is in life and what she's keeping from her clients.</p>
<p><strong>Episode One </strong>centers on Rochelle. Rochelle’s… doing her best. Two months out of jail and three months clean, she’s determined to regain custody of her two young kids at a court hearing later in the day. When she starts to become uneasy about the process, it’s up to Leslie to encourage her to not give up hope.</p>
<p><strong>Episode Two</strong> focuses on Isabel, a young girl getting her first relaxer. As far as Isabel knows, she needs straight hair to be beautiful and that’s all that matters. Isabel’s the embodiment of the kind of values parents sometimes push on their children. Her steadfastness makes Leslie rethink her own parenting.</p>
<p>Outside the doors of the salon, life throws everything at these women. Inside these doors, however, they’re allowed and encouraged to literally let their hair down. The shop chair mimics the therapist’s couch and they’re able to let it all out for their stylist and confident, Leslie.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>You Scratch My Scalp and I'll Scratch Yours!</h3>
<p>Did you like what I did there?</p>
<p>While <strong>Talking Shop</strong> will eventually have a 10-episode season, I’m currently shooting the first two episodes as my thesis. The $5,000 you help me raise will be used for food, cast and crew, equipment, locations and post-production fees.</p>
<p>Any donation counts and will push me closer to my goal! Nothing is too small!</p>
<p>There are also great perks! The right side of this page details what you can get in return for helping fund this project. Each donation tier is named for a black hair style I’ve either enjoyed or admired from afar. Perks include social media shout outs, personalized thank yous and merch featuring original artwork designed by <strong>Talking Shop </strong>resident graphic artist Sasha Hollomon!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our web series will be set and shot in St. John's, Newfoundland. It will tell a tale of vanishing trust, moral ambiguity, the recent Fentanyl epidemic and how your decisions impact everyone around you. ""Blue Moon"" is a crime thriller as told through the eyes of a young, innocent woman who's approach to the situation she finds herself in will leave the audience wondering: what would I do?</p>
<p>We are excited to have the opportunity to tell a fast-paced crime thriller with a young woman at the helm and to showcase the lesser talked about side of the beautiful St. John's.</p>
<p><b>What makes us different than every other web series?</b></p>
<p>A web series is a great professional development tool as it gives you an opportunity to have your work seen by a wider audience. It is our goal for ""Blue Moon"" to be a professional development/learning experience for as many people as possible.  We plan to create a crew made up of professional and experienced department heads who will have assistants/crew working under them who are students or people in the early stages of their film careers. This will allow a mentorship for the students involved and an opportunity for them to network with local professionals.</p>
<p><strong>What would your funding be put towards?</strong></p>
<p>Not to pay ourselves! Production is expensive and any and all contributions wouldn't go a stray. Your funding will be spread between the production of each of the four episodes and will be distributed amongst props, production design, wardrobe and equipment rental. We are a micro-budget project operating under a $20'000.00 budget for all four episodes combined.</p>

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>Hey! Hello! So, here’s the thing. Last year, I ran a Kickstarter campaign for Mr Biffo’s Found Footage – a campaign that was successful beyond anything I could have imagined.</p><p>Thanks to that money – a shade over £18k – I’ve learned a lot in the past year about how to make TV and film projects a reality.</p><p>One of the most important things I’ve learned is that making things is really bloody expensive. Even something like catering can eat up nearly a hundred quid a day.</p><p>Given that some of the money we raised must be earmarked for venue hire for our premiere, and DVDs, and the like… and the fact that Kickstarter takes a cut of the money… £18 grand isn’t even what we had to spend on the show. </p><p>Still, since the completion of the Kickstarter campaign, we’ve bought props, costumes, software, equipment... we’ve hired studios, we’ve paid actors’ expenses, and the only way we’ve been able to do this, frankly, is because so many people were so generous in the first place, and because almost everyone who has done work on the series thus far has given their time and expertise for free. </p><p>Because of that, I’ve tried to ensure that your faith in my ability to pull this off will be rewarded. This September, there will be at least six episodes of lunacy from Mr Biffo’s Found Footage – possibly more. I think the show looks at least as good as anything you’ll have seen on proper telly – and will be considerably stranger. We've songs, cartoons, sketches, bizarre TV shows - and more!</p><p><strong>STYLE</strong></p><p>I really want to end the series in style. The finale we have planned brings together the threads of backstory that are woven throughout the series. It's part of the series, but also something rather different. It is also going to be the most ambitious episode we’ve attempted – nothing less than a short science fiction movie, clocking in at around 20 minutes. To get an idea of what's planned, watch the video at the top of this page - though the actual finale will be even bigger, better, and more widescreen...</p><p>We’ve already booked a stunning location for two days filming later this month, started building the props and finishing the costumes, and we’ve got commitment from our cast. You WILL learn the strange and secret origin of Goujon John and Xenoxxx Industries. </p><p>However… to realise this on screen isn’t cheap. I’ve already dipped quite deeply into my own pocket in order to make it a reality. As a result of the main series being funded – and then some - a number of you have suggested I try to avoid poverty by launching another Kickstarter to help pay for the finale. </p><p><strong>EXPENSES</strong></p><p>Here are the three main outstanding expenses on the Location hire: £800 Accommodation for cast and crew: £650 (approx.) Vehicle hire: £300 (approx.). </p><p>That doesn’t take into account the props, costumes, and equipment (such as a camera jib, a new DLSR, and a Steadicam) purchased already with the finale in mind. So, ideally, we need to raise at least £1750 to cover the above. That's what I'm asking for (plus a little extra to cover fees etc.).</p><p>If we make more than I'm asking for, I'll ensure all of it goes into the filming. We still need to pay for a number of prosthetic masks, pyrotechnics, and prop purchases, plus CGI effects. I promise that every penny will be up there on the screen for you to enjoy - and I'll find a way to use your donations creatively. If you've always wanted to see a version of Aliens where the monsters are living bums... then this is what you've been waiting for.</p><p><strong>NO OBLIGATION</strong></p><p>I know a lot of you reading this will have given already to Mr Biffo's Found Footage via Kickstarter - and I completely understand you not wanting to fork out again for the finale. There's absolutely no obligation here: the finale will be getting made one way or another. </p><p>However, we've come up with what I think are a nice selection of unique rewards for those who do fancy backing it.

I will hopefully see you in the vortex...</p><p>Paul</p></div>","Hey! Hello! So, here’s the thing. Last year, I ran a Kickstarter campaign for Mr Biffo’s Found Footage – a campaign that was successful beyond anything I could have imagined.Thanks to that money – a shade over £18k – I’ve learned a lot in the past year about how to make TV and film projects a reality.One of the most important things I’ve learned is that making things is really bloody expensive. Even something like catering can eat up nearly a hundred quid a day.Given that some of the money we raised must be earmarked for venue hire for our premiere, and DVDs, and the like… and the fact that Kickstarter takes a cut of the money… £18 grand isn’t even what we had to spend on the show. Still, since the completion of the Kickstarter campaign, we’ve bought props, costumes, software, equipment... we’ve hired studios, we’ve paid actors’ expenses, and the only way we’ve been able to do this, frankly, is because so many people were so generous in the first place, and because almost everyone who has done work on the series thus far has given their time and expertise for free. Because of that, I’ve tried to ensure that your faith in my ability to pull this off will be rewarded. This September, there will be at least six episodes of lunacy from Mr Biffo’s Found Footage – possibly more. I think the show looks at least as good as anything you’ll have seen on proper telly – and will be considerably stranger. We've songs, cartoons, sketches, bizarre TV shows - and more!STYLEI really want to end the series in style. The finale we have planned brings together the threads of backstory that are woven throughout the series. It's part of the series, but also something rather different. It is also going to be the most ambitious episode we’ve attempted – nothing less than a short science fiction movie, clocking in at around 20 minutes. To get an idea of what's planned, watch the video at the top of this page - though the actual finale will be even bigger, better, and more widescreen...We’ve already booked a stunning location for two days filming later this month, started building the props and finishing the costumes, and we’ve got commitment from our cast. You WILL learn the strange and secret origin of Goujon John and Xenoxxx Industries. However… to realise this on screen isn’t cheap. I’ve already dipped quite deeply into my own pocket in order to make it a reality. As a result of the main series being funded – and then some - a number of you have suggested I try to avoid poverty by launching another Kickstarter to help pay for the finale. EXPENSESHere are the three main outstanding expenses on the Location hire: £800 Accommodation for cast and crew: £650 (approx.) Vehicle hire: £300 (approx.). That doesn’t take into account the props, costumes, and equipment (such as a camera jib, a new DLSR, and a Steadicam) purchased already with the finale in mind. So, ideally, we need to raise at least £1750 to cover the above. That's what I'm asking for (plus a little extra to cover fees etc.).If we make more than I'm asking for, I'll ensure all of it goes into the filming. We still need to pay for a number of prosthetic masks, pyrotechnics, and prop purchases, plus CGI effects. I promise that every penny will be up there on the screen for you to enjoy - and I'll find a way to use your donations creatively. If you've always wanted to see a version of Aliens where the monsters are living bums... then this is what you've been waiting for.NO OBLIGATIONI know a lot of you reading this will have given already to Mr Biffo's Found Footage via Kickstarter - and I completely understand you not wanting to fork out again for the finale. There's absolutely no obligation here: the finale will be getting made one way or another. However, we've come up with what I think are a nice selection of unique rewards for those who do fancy backing it. Some are designed for those who didn't get to support the series first time around, and some may be of interest to those who have already. Take a look!And thanks for reading this. I will hopefully see you in the vortex...Paul",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2><i><u><strong>Summary</strong></u></i></h2>
<p>For the past 8 months, I’ve been sharing what I’ve learned in 27 years of art study with each of you through my Facebook Live videos.  I’ve been honored and astounded by the reception these videos have received – often with over 3,000 of you tuning in to enjoy the live videos.   It has brought me an incredible amount of joy.  Through the process, I got the idea to develop this into something more, and have collaborated with Emmy-award winning producers to develop a TV show concept called ""Paint Your Adventure.”  The theme of the show will be all about capturing the heart and soul of plein air painting (painting in the outdoors), while exploring adventure and honoring and preserving our nation’s parks and natural areas.  </p>
<p>Recently, I shared that I am a cancer survivor. Getting into the outdoors to paint and explore has had healing and inspirational benefits for me, and I want to share that experience on a broader spectrum.  </p>
<p>In order to make this possible, I’ll need your support.  I’m looking to raise $10,000 to fund a Pilot episode and sizzle reel of “Paint Your Adventure” which we will use to present the concept to distributors… which means that if everyone who has been enjoying my videos donated just $10, we’d easily reach our goal!  </p>
<p>My vision for the full series is about embracing the beauty of nature by plein air painting coupled with the adventure offered at specific locations - from horseback riding in the Rocky Mountains to hiking the Grand Canyon, to kayaking, camping and exploring Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and so on!  It’s part art instruction, part travel, part adventure.</p>
<p>I'd love to raise enough to allow for guests to come along this adventure with me.   Sometimes that guest may be a seasoned professional artist sharing inspiration and conversation, or the guest may be a beginner, ready to explore the joys of painting in the great outdoors for the first time.  I want to encourage others to realize the possibility of discovering a the joy and experience of painting en plein air, and discovering a new adventure that awaits!</p>
<h2><u><i><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></i></u></h2>
<p>Jeremy Salo, Emmy-winning producer of “Your Brush with Nature” on Netflix has teamed up with me to create this series.  He and his crew are based in Michigan, and for $10,000 we could shoot in the beautiful Great Lakes area, so I set the fundraising goal at $10K. </p>
<p>I am very excited about this opportunity to bring this to the world and since I am asking you for help, it is not without incentive, so I’m giving my art to top donors to thank them for their help in achieving this goal!</p>
<p>I will be gifting original plein air oil paintings that I have done to top donors:</p>
<p>$10 signed postcard of one of Jessica Henry's paintings, thanking you for your donation.</p>
<p>$30 A signed 16"" x 12"" Print of ""Open Mind &amp; Open Sea"" Jessica's newest painting.</p>
<p>$50 A signed print plus a one time special offer of 30% OFF any art work from Jessica's web site (Less work that is currently at Sunti World Art Gallery)</p>
<p>$100 The same as the ($50) offer, but 50% off any art work from Jessica's web site (Less work that is currently at Sunti World Art Gallery)</p>

<p>And if you are one of those amazing souls who would like to donate $5,000, I will send you a very large spectacular landscape oil painting, approximately 24’’ x 48.” </p>
<p>All things considered, if everyone that has enjoyed one of my videos gave just $10, it would more than help us get the ball rolling on this fantastic journey.  </p>
<h2><u><i><strong>The Impact</strong></i></u></h2>
<p>I’ve shared the experience of plein air painting with my 10 year old daughter, and we have created incredible memories together.  As a cancer survivor, I would also love the possibility of offering interested children of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital the opportunity to paint along with me in the restorative ambiance of nature, and feel the joy of creating a painting outside!</p>

</div></div>","Think The Flying Nun, All the fun but without the Aerodynamics!! Thank you for stopping by just now! I am Jacqi Bowe, creator of the show. My roots in comedy go way back when in third grade, I begged my mom to enroll me in Catholic school. Yes, it's true! At age seven,  I decided we needed religion and  after shopping around signed right up with the Catholics. So into Parochial School I marched, incredulous to some of my fellow students some who had been dragged screaming and kicking into the 3rd grade.  Our delightful Sister Katherine played folk guitar and made us laugh. This all changed in the 4th grade when we got Sister-To-Remain-Nameless and I realized the dire necessity of comedy to make it through homeroom and life! At Sacred Heart Parochial school I found my calling. To become a nun...on television!!!!!My past credits so you will know I have the chops to be a show runner!I have been touring non-stop with The Jacqi Bowe Variety Show for the past fifteen years. Notable gigs before this whirlwind run, include the
national company of A CHORUS LINE,
dancing for Kenny Ortega on Young Turks
industrials with celebrities including Tim Conway,
performing in ""Show Biz Is"" as a Kid Of The Kingdom at Disneyland, 
starring in the comedy sit com pilot-""In The Soup""
guest starring in Spike TV's  Reality Show World Worst Tenant. (Please don't tell my landlady)
I have written, produced and acted in numerous videos on youtube for Life Boat Coaches and Our Lady of Hollywood and Vine. And have been encouraged by the thousands of views and enthusiastic comments from fans. I have romped on stages doing 
Improv at Second City, The Comedy Store and Bang Theater. 
A national Stand-Up Tour of the Pacific Northwest and Mid-West USA
AND

I won first place for my cartoon strip ""The Add-ventures of Pam'la Pesto Perfekt-The Perfekt Estrogen American"" in the Charles M Shultz Cartoon Contest at the Marin County Fair and was published in The San Jose Mercury News, Campbell Times and Santa Cruz Good Times. 
The Consecration of Sister Mary MallarkeyI created this unorthodox Irish Catholic Nun in my solo character solo show, ""Jacqi Bowe is Not Quite Herself"" and ""Emotional Garage Sale"".  Sister Mary Mallarkey was an instant onstage hit and my audiences insisted I write a sit com for her. So for the past few years I have done just that!Why it's time for a comedy starring Sister Mary MallarkeyNot since the Flying Nun has there been an American comedy set in the Catholic Church. With the scandals surrounding this institution in recent years, we can probably see why no network has been green lighting any Sister Beatrice-centric pilots! HOWEVER!! There are many recovering Catholics out there that could use some healing from laughter,  devout Catholics, lapsed, ex-Catholics, who appreciate the irreverent and atheists who have a daily requirement for the spiritually absurd. Mischief Mission StatementI am dedicated to bringing laughter to the world.Funding the Fun, Helping out with The Hilarity, 
Our immediate goal is to raise enough money to get this series off the ground. We will use the funding to shoot the pilot and one more episode to jump start the show’s first season. We hope to follow the business of ""High Maintenance"" which started as a web series and is now a comedy show on HBO.
Our Lady has been in research and development for a couple of years,  and I just know it will bring you joy and laughter. Let's make this together. With your help we can produce a visually stunning show and a side-splitting hit. We can all say we knew each other when!
I have surrounded myself with a top notch cast so we can't go wrong! Robert Babish, Jake Novak, Steve Cardwell, Garrett Miller, Linda Lodge, to name a few! 

Here are some of the things for which we shall use your love offerings!
Equipment  rentals
Locations and sets (Churches don't come easy!)
Director and Crew
Lighting (Sister Mallarkey is fussy about her close ups)
Sound (Gotta hear the jokes)
Props and wardrobe (Hollywood Costume Shoppe got us thus far but it's time for authenticity)
Insurance and legal
Pre-production
Stipends for the writing team and crew - it’s important to pay artists and technicians for their work!
Food for hungry staff during 12-hour shoots 
Post-production
Celebrity Cameos (A listers have a price)
Marketing (God is omnipotent but the people need to be told about it!)

This is just the beginning.  We have lofty goals and are well aware that Comedy Central, Hulu, Amazon, Netflix are all looking for the next new funny thing! Let's make this IT!

The show is about WNKD Darien, a fictional NPR member station in a fictional town in suburban Ohio that is profoundly bored by the smooth voices and smooth jazz of wannabe-NPR. Our series follows Eliza, a smart but hypersensitive pipe dreamer with a This American Life-esque show perpetually on the brink of cancellation, and the rest of WNKD Darien staff as they face budget cuts, bored listeners, and their own lofty ambitions trying to hang onto their jobs and pay tribute to the town they call home.I Swear It’s Not Boring is a full-length pilot and four 10 to 15 minute subsequent episodes. It’s a quick-witted character comedy and a love letter to public media, relentless optimists, Ira Glass, dying industries, strategy board games, suburban boredom, and people who cry in public. Gabbi Boyd as Eliza, the host of thematic storytelling show Our Darien Everyday (very different from This American Life, and, in fact, if you close one ear, better); a hopeless optimist with an emphasis on the hopeless(She's also the writer and showrunner, so here's a bit about her if you're gonna give our show money: Gabbi is a Chicago-based funnygirl.

She studied writing and acting for the stage and screen at Ball State University where she won awards for her full-length sketch show Nobody Panic and her one-act play Friends in High Places and got lucky enough to have conversations about writing and acting with smart people like Mindy Kaling, Spike Jonze, and Ted Griffin. She’s been featured on the web as an actor in series like The Soon to be Cancelled Sketch Show and Go Fund Yourselves (which she also co-created). She likes writing jokes and characters much more than writing boastful paragraphs about her work and thus would like to stop bragging now.) Laura Petro as Gina, WNKD's sound engineer; cold as ice and full of hot air.(She's also the producer, so here's a bit about her if you're gonna give our show money: Laura is a graduate of Depaul University's Digital Cinema program.

<h3>What's so special about Fancy-Free?</h3>
<p>Fancy-Free is a found footage style music video web series occuring in Uncanny Valley-- a dystopian resort located  in the heart of Death Valley, frozen in 2007 after a national government collapse. This story aims to please music-lovers and binge-watchers alike with 12 weird and wacky narrative episodes and 8 intermittent music videos from a concept album. It's a sci-fi crime show wrapped in a whimsical Tim Burton-esque look, and driven by a cast of badass girls struggling with power dynamics and what it means to be human in a mass-market dystopia.</p>
<p>Riley Buffington began Psykobreak! in his senior year of high school performing at his talent show and battle of the bands. Since then, he's directed four music videos underneath the same story-driven concept, the last three of which have been with Klopfgeist Amusement, a production group he helped to form after moving from California to the DC area.</p>
<p>The plan has always been to make Psykobreak! into a series, and now is the time. Riley has a dedicated team of filmmakers, and an amazing group of performers ready to bring the characters to life on the screen as well as sing on the show's concept album.</p>
<p>We hope this series will also serve as a proof-of-concept, potentially paving way for four albums chronicling the adventures and mishaps of the doll-girls and their ever-plotting creator.</p>
<h3>Here's where you come in...</h3>
<p>Our team is so dedicated to bringing this story to life, and we are unbelievably excited to take on this challenge. With songs and scripts already in the works, we need your help so that we can film Fancy-Free this summer!</p>
<p>With your support, we can cover the costs of everything that goes into making this web-series, from wigs and gaff tape, to food for our crew.</p>
<h3>Where's your money going?</h3>
<p>We're going to be working with a shoestring budget considering the scale of this project, so we're lucky to have a cast and crew ready to volunteer their time, talents, and hardwork. To keep costs down, we have to be creative. We're working as much as possible with what we already have, thrifting for our new costumes, and making some DIY equipment. That still leaves us needing $4,700, and as a group of aspiring artists, we can't cover for everything out of pocket. Here's what you'd be helping us pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need about $900 to assemble costumes for our otherworldly characters</li>
<li>To feed our lovely cast and crew throughout filming of all episodes will cost about $800</li>
<li>We have most of our equipment already, but will need $1,130 more for some upgrades</li>
<li>All our props, production design materials, and special FX have an estimated budget of $570</li>
<li>To cover travel costs of going between locations around MD/VA/DC will be about $500</li>
<li>The new makeup will run us around $300</li>
<li>On top of that, unexpected costs for last minute materials are sure to come up, and we're budgeting in $500 for that</li>
</ul>
<p>No matter what, we're going to see this series through in one form or another, but the more help we get from you, the more resources we will have to construct a believable world for Fancy-Free.</p>
</div><div><h3>What's in it for you? The perks:</h3></div><div>
<div><p>In addition to the personal fulfillment of helping to see a unique passion to fruition, we've got some Fancy-Free swagger to sweeten the deal.</p></div>

<h3>Short Summaries Of Each Show</h3>
<p>Fitting:</p>
<p>Wanting independence away from the legacy of his family’s restaurant, Sam Liu makes a deal to move into the apartment upstairs while still working part-time. But inside the cramped New York apartment, Sam finds Zoya, an inspiring stand-up comedian having doubts about her arranged marriage back home. Now, the two 20-something year olds must help one another break expectations and discover who they are before their families’ legacies fully take over.</p>
<p>Lapsed:</p>
<p>Amber should be knocking it out of the park, but right now she’s striking out. Once a bright engineering student, Amber’s future becomes uncertain when her occasional drinking turns into full blown alcoholism. Whether by random chance or divine intervention, Amber’s older brother Vincent finds her at her lowest moment and takes her in to help “solve” her issues. In Lapsed, Amber’s closed off, sarcastic demeanor clashes with her uber-Catholic brother’s sickening positivity. The dark comedy looks at how these two learn to live with each other while exploring addiction, family, faith and annoying the ever-loving hell out of your siblings.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

Fitting:
Wanting independence away from the legacy of his family’s restaurant, Sam Liu makes a deal to move into the apartment upstairs while still working part-time. But inside the cramped New York apartment, Sam finds Zoya, an inspiring stand-up comedian having doubts about her arranged marriage back home. Now, the two 20-something year olds must help one another break expectations and discover who they are before their families’ legacies fully take over.
Lapsed:
Amber should be knocking it out of the park, but right now she’s striking out. Once a bright engineering student, Amber’s future becomes uncertain when her occasional drinking turns into full blown alcoholism. Whether by random chance or divine intervention, Amber’s older brother Vincent finds her at her lowest moment and takes her in to help “solve” her issues. In Lapsed, Amber’s closed off, sarcastic demeanor clashes with her uber-Catholic brother’s sickening positivity. The dark comedy looks at how these two learn to live with each other while exploring addiction, family, faith and annoying the ever-loving hell out of your siblings.
What We Need & What You Get

We are aiming for a goal of $5,000. This amount will be split evenly in half for each of the 2 shows to use towards budgeting. That way each show will get $2,500.
Showrunners Alex Tolerico and Kevin Loh have been refining their ideas on each series since this past spring, and the crowdfunding will be used to make these ideas into production realities.
Even if we do not meet our goal of $5,000, the amount that we do receive will be split evenly and will still be put towards making these shows, so any amount helps!
Money from crowdfunding will be put towards budgeting equipment, locations, company moves, and more in order to put out the best shows we can.
Estimated series release dates are in this spring, so those who support us will be able to see how their contributions have helped.

The Impact
Thoughtfully written and passionately made, here's why we care about these stories and how your donation is directly supporting us students:

Based in personal experience and heritage, Kevin's and Alex's stories show the creativity of the film industry's next generation.
Each student in the class is committed to putting out incredible work and have done so every other semester during their time at NYU, so the same can be expected from Fitting and Lapsed.
Not only are these projects a culmination of our hard work and learning technicality-wise, but also story-wise, as both shows have a little bit of each student's personal experiences in them as put forth in the writer's rooms.

Risks & Challenges
As TV series rookies, Lapsed and Fitting will have a learning curve for all of us, here's what to know:

Despite these mini series having new territory for all of us, we have plenty of guidance from our production advisors and Professor Goutman here at NYU.
We look forward to putting out the best work we can and overcoming the challenges.

<p>Here's our first episode - check it out! It's a proof-of-concept, not up to the level of quality we anticipate for future episodes... but that's where <i>you </i>come in!</p>

<h3>The Gist</h3>
<p>We're a bunch of people, most of whom reside in the Los Angeles, CA area.​</p>
<p>Some of us are actors. Some of us are writers. Some of us are editors, production assistants, camera operators or craft service picker-uppers. ​</p>
<p>But all of us share a passion. We envision a better world than the one we've currently got, and we want to have a hand in changing it for the better. </p>
<p>Why are we creating this show? So that we can convince the progressive-minded, forward-thinking old people of tomorrow (i.e. young people) to use their votes and activism to stem the current tide of political corruption in this country, and start replacing all the baddies with smart, principled people of high integrity and admirable vision. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are working toward a goal of $15,000. That amount would be enough to finance the next half dozen episodes of <i>We Can't Even</i>, at which point we hope to be significantly monetizing shows from that point forward, mainly through YouTube advertising clicks and views. </p>
<p>Here are some of the things that the money raised will cover: </p>
<ul>
<li>Lighting, sound and camera equipment</li>
<li>Props and costumes</li>
<li>Minimal pay for actors, writers, editors, camera operators, etc., so that we can reward our artistic talent for their time and effort, and attract better talent to cover the technical aspect of the show (which is currently lacking)</li>
<li>Website maintenance and fees</li>
<li>Set pieces and design</li>
<li>Graphic design</li>
<li>Craft services</li>
<li>A foosball table (jk; we're more into air hockey)</li>
</ul>
<p>What do <i>you </i>get out of it? Other than contributing toward a project that's trying to save the freaking world? </p>
<ul>
<li>If you make a donation of at least <strong>$25</strong>, we'll mention you in the credits of an upcoming episode</li>
<li>If you make a donation of at least <strong>$50</strong>, you'll get a credit mention, plus we'll send you advance footage of an upcoming episode, weeks before anyone else sees it!</li>
<li>If you make a donation of at least <strong>$100</strong>, you'll get all of the above, plus you'll have access to some outtakes and bloopers. </li>
<li>If you make a donation of at least <b>$500</b>, you'll get all of the above, plus one of us will call you on your birthday and sing you a song. </li>
<li>If you make a donation of at least <b>$1,000</b>, you'll get all of the above, plus calls on the days before and after your birthday. And we'll be naked. </li>
</ul>
<p>In the unfortunate event that we do not hit our goal, we will still film as many episodes as our bankroll will allow. If we feel that we have not raised enough to reasonably embark on any more episodes (which we do not anticipate), all funds raised will be donated to the ACLU, or returned to you if you would prefer. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We know we're setting our sights high. We don't expect this one little show to flip the world's script entirely. But doing what we can to engage America's youth and get them active in politics seems - to us, at least - like a pretty big deal. </p>
<p>And who knows? Maybe this thing will really take off, and we'll become the <i>Daily Show </i>of the interwebs. The actual <i>Daily Show </i>had a large hand in getting Obama elected in 2008; it isn't completely outside the realm of possibility that another show could have a similar effect in the coming years, especially if it is one specifically targeted at first-time voters, answering their questions and addressing their needs and interests.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're excited about this project but don't have a dime to spare, here are some other ways you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word! Use Indiegogo's share tools to let your friends, enemies and loved ones know what we're all about. </li>
<li>If you know someone who's smart, funny, politically interested and willing to work for peanuts, send them our way! We might have a boom mic for them to hold!</li>
<li>VOTE. Make other people vote. Yes, that's right - MAKE THEM. </li>

<p>Hi, I am the Creator and one of the Executive Producers for PRIDE: The Series, Dorell Anthony. Our show is currently on Amazon Instant Video and is gearing up for production on the second half of the second season of our show. We are looking for potential sponsorship partners and contributors for our series. Our show strives to be more than entertainment; we promote a mission statement that empowers the LGBTQ community and, in general, those who are underrepresented.</p>

<h2>Bloodsquirt XL, and the meaning of denim</h2>
<p>Evan Rollo had a vision, an idea, of a man who sought justice at costs- Bloodsquirt XL, formerly Detective Yahn Yandle, is that man. Slipping on his signature jean jacket, Bloodsquirt XL feels the power overcome him...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>A Little More On Walter Smits and Evan Rollo</h3>
<p>Evan Rollo has spent the majority of his time writing trying to create pieces that anyone can relate to. He doesn't always succeed. He currently lives in Duluth MN and is always looking for ways to be a better listener, so his writing can be even easier to relate to.</p>
<p>Walter Smits graduated from University of Milwaukee Wisconsin film school last spring. During his time at UWMilwaukee he started the Queens of Scot stop motion club where the team created a dark-comedy about the future of robots… Henry Sellick even approved and they won First Place prize at the student film and video festival.</p>
<p>Walter has been making movies since 2004 when he debuted GIJOE the movie living in the jungle and JEDI vs PIRATE. Since then he has made animations, puppetry, and live action shorts. This is his first time creating a multi-episodic series.</p>
<p>Note: Walt insists you read the “DEAD BIRD” Calvin and Hobbes strip.</p>
<p>Walt is forever interested and driven by surreal beauty and the absurd. </p>
<p>On BSXL:</p>
<p>“Evan came to me with this idea and said, Bloodsquirt and then proceeded to giggle. He told me that he has an idea. “Bloodsquirt,” he repeated, again giggling. He told me about this denim-clad idiot who was overly intense about fighting justice. I said ok, write it…. and he did. Three episodes down, here we are. There is a lot of denim, a lot of justice, some blood, and one dream donkey. We have two episodes left to shoot. </p>
<p>The series grows from goofy, to bizarre, to surreal, to over the top and is set entirely in DULUTH MINNESOTA, my hometown and only true love.</p>
<p>Oh, and, Bloodsquirt XL kinda made me love denim. So, I’m pretty into denim now. In fact, I literally just bought a denim jacket.”</p>
<h3>How We'll Use The Money</h3>
<p>Making a webseries ain't cheap! Especially one with copious amounts of fake blood and fine denim. We're looking for your support to finance the production of BSXL episodes 4 &amp; 5, the grand culmination of the BSXL series. We need help with all sorts of production related items, including: </p>
<ul>
<li>Wardrobe (primarily the aforementioned fine denim)</li>
<li>Set Design (these episodes are gonna have some pretty sick sets)</li>
<li>Equipment (two words- dream sequence)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>THE GOODS</h3>
<p>I know, I know, ""get to the good stuff already!"" you're shouting. Well here it is, the section where we talk about the PERKS. </p>
<p>It's 2018, you can go out on Amazon and you can pretty much buy whatever your heart desires. We know that, and that's why our perks are unique to the project and are all designed by us, with several perks handmade by Walter Smits himself. We want to give your perks that are emblematic of the spirit of BSXL that you can hold onto for years to come. </p>

<p>My name is Rotana. I'm an independent artist from Saudi Arabia living in Los Angeles. <strong>I am F*D &amp; Blessed</strong>. I was born and raised in Saudi Arabia. I'm blessed because my culture  taught me devotion, and truly sees women as sacred. I am f*cked because I was also taught that sexuality was shameful and dangerous.<strong> I grew up with no sex education at all, I knew nothing about my body,</strong> how it worked, or the power available to me when I am in right relationship with it. </p>
<p>Yet, I always loved moving my body, being loud, drama and all things erotic. </p>
<p>This led me into internal<strong> confusion and self-hatred</strong>. It left me disempowered to set boundaries and say no.  <strong>I don't want anyone else to feel that way.</strong> I spent last two years in a deep dive reading and educating myself on these topics of body, pleasure, sexuality, consent and eroticism. I had so many<strong> aha! moments </strong>I couldn't contain myself anymore and decided to make a show.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><u><i><b>F*D &amp; Blessed is a hilarious educational, straight-to-camera show where I talk about things no one ever told me anything about (anatomy, pleasure, sexuality, eroticism, boundaries, consent) and more. </b></i></u></p>

<p><strong>Making this show has healed me, and I believe it can</strong> <b>heal so many in the Muslim community and beyond.

<p>It is a chance to normalize talking about sexuality in <strong>MENA and Muslim </strong><b>communities</b>.

<p>Our internal compass and intuition can only be felt <strong>through </strong>the body.  It is there where all of our freedom, power and liberation lies.

<h3>We're Taking Things Back to the Glory Days!</h3>
<p>Glory Daze is a comedic web series created by Ailish Elzy and David Larkin and will serve as our third-year thesis project for the Writing and Producing for Television Program at Loyola Marymount University. We both gained experience producing, writing and directing while at grad school and are ready to put it all to good use.<br/><br/>You know that feeling when your friends around you are succeeding and you're not? When your entire 20s seem like nothing is going according to plan and the only way to feel better is by getting drunk and reliving the past?</p>
<p>Oh, you don't? Uh, yeah... us either. But that's the story we're telling with Glory Daze anyway!<br/><br/>The episode we're producing is the story of four friends, Mia, Shane, Dexter and Marlo, who don't quite have their shit together. The night before Shane is supposed to move away for a job, they decide to have one last epic night of pregaming before a concert. As these things tend to play out, nothing goes according to plan and they all have to deal with the consequences.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>We're hoping to produce the first episode of this series, and we have a flexible budget of $5000 that will cover production and post-production costs. Although it all takes place in a single location, there are some expenses involved to really bring this epic night to life.<br/><br/>Aside from wardrobe, location, transportation, and feeding our awesome cast and crew, we'd also like to have a few trippy special effects, a ton of fun props, and license some original party music, and any donation will go a long way to helping get this off the ground. But that's not all...<br/><br/>We also have rewards! Each donation level comes with its own series of special perks, as seen off to the side. Not only will you be helping a couple film students' dreams come true, but you'll also get some cool swag for doing so!</p>
<h3>Other Ways To Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate to the campaign but still want to help, that's totally great too. Sharing our campaign on social media with all your rich, generous friends will also go a long way!</p>
<p>And we'd love any food, drink, or craft service donations!</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>'Mature' is a comedy web-series, created with the goal of breaking down the stereotypes surrounding middle-aged university students. As university students ourselves, we've seen first-hand the kind of gossip and down-grading comments that follow some of the older students around, and we aim to banish these stereotypes for good.</p>
<p>Combining comedy, family, and drama, 'Mature' is a series that everyone can enjoy and relate to, and we hope that you will join us on our journey to get our project filmed and out into the world.</p>
<p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534403377/s5wfq0xqjnwicrm3r0i6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where the Money Goes</h3>
<p>Let's start by saying where the money <i>doesn't </i>go. 'Mature' is a made-by-students, for-students, production, supported by the Queensland University of Technology. With the support of QUT, we are lucky enough to have access to top-notch film equipment, and editing software, as well the University itself, and we will be sure to make the most of it. </p>
<p><i>But what does University support mean to me, as the backer?</i></p>
<p>Having University support means that all money raised will go directly to the making of the film itself, that is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wardrobe - what the actors will be wearing</li>
<li>Production Design - what you see in the film (you see that lamp? that couch? that's all you)</li>
</ul>
<p>No hidden expenses. No wondering where your valuable contribution went. It's all visible, right there on the screen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Meet the Team</h3>
<p>No film can be made alone. Our team is comprised of a group of like-minded people who are eager to pool their resources and make their vision a reality. We all come from a wide-range of backgrounds, with many of us mature-age students ourselves; we consider this our strength, using our different perspectives to bring something new to our production, and make sure we're not leaving anyone out. It's never fun to be singled out - comedy should be enjoyed together, not laughing <i>at</i>, but laughing <i>with</i>.</p>

</div></div>","Summary
'Mature' is a comedy web-series, created with the goal of breaking down the stereotypes surrounding middle-aged university students. As university students ourselves, we've seen first-hand the kind of gossip and down-grading comments that follow some of the older students around, and we aim to banish these stereotypes for good.
Combining comedy, family, and drama, 'Mature' is a series that everyone can enjoy and relate to, and we hope that you will join us on our journey to get our project filmed and out into the world.
 

Where the Money Goes
Let's start by saying where the money doesn't go. 'Mature' is a made-by-students, for-students, production, supported by the Queensland University of Technology. With the support of QUT, we are lucky enough to have access to top-notch film equipment, and editing software, as well the University itself, and we will be sure to make the most of it. 
But what does University support mean to me, as the backer?
Having University support means that all money raised will go directly to the making of the film itself, that is:

Wardrobe - what the actors will be wearing
Production Design - what you see in the film (you see that lamp? that couch? that's all you)

No hidden expenses. No wondering where your valuable contribution went. It's all visible, right there on the screen.

Meet the Team
No film can be made alone. Our team is comprised of a group of like-minded people who are eager to pool their resources and make their vision a reality. We all come from a wide-range of backgrounds, with many of us mature-age students ourselves; we consider this our strength, using our different perspectives to bring something new to our production, and make sure we're not leaving anyone out. It's never fun to be singled out - comedy should be enjoyed together, not laughing at, but laughing with.
Our Directors:
 
        Stephen Rice                 Evie Hart-Reid
        ​(Episode 1)                      (Episode 2)
Our Producer:

 Annaliese Mauchline
Our Writers:
  
      Lucy Hamilton            Brittany McDonald          Letitia Thomas
         (Episode 1)                     (Episode 2)                     (Episode 2)

<h3>The Play</h3>
<p>WORLD SERIES tells the story of Adrian Page, a senior at Boston University who takes a side job sorting through the archives of retired LGBTQ rights lawyer Charles Finley. The play is about Charles remembering the early years of the AIDS epidemic, and Adrian learning why Charles cannot forgive the straight community for their behavior in those years. It is serialized into seven parts, each around forty minutes, and will be presented online starting on the first day of the World Series in October. The play will be free to stream online.</p>
<p>This play is about home, I’m from Massachusetts and went to Mass College of Art and Design in Boston. I now a performer at the iO Theater, where I am on an improv team and also where I had live recordings of my first radio play You and Eye.</p>
<p>It is very important to me as a writer to be a part of a gay tradition. With my work I want to honor those that came before me and push forward and keep working for those to come. History, the history of gay people in this country is so important to me.</p>

<ul>
<li>The funds for the cast will be split between the 8 actors. </li>
<li>There will be five days of production. I will need to pay the cast and crew for their days of work on recording and for the many days of work my editor and composer will spend on piecing the play together and making the score. </li>
<li>If I do not reach my goal I will put all the money into paying my cast and crew first. Who needs food when you have theater? </li>
</ul>
<h3>Why is this play important?</h3>
<p>In a world of huge productions and enormous budgets, the dignity of the story and the production can be lost, which is why I think it is tremendously important to support small productions. I am telling this story about gay history working with gay people, keeping the integrity of queer storytelling intact. </p>
</div><div>
<p>I wrote this play as a memorial for the people who died of AIDS in Massachusetts in the early years of the epidemic. I wrote it as an everlasting thank you to the activists who fought valiantly for fair treatment by their government and by the scientific institution.  I wrote this play as a warning to my generation. Do we want to repeat the behavior of our government and straight citizens exhibited when faced with AIDS? Do we want to stand back and watch ourselves die? Do we want to treat life as if it’s a game?

<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>Hey guys! Although we reside in Los Angeles, CA,  Dot (actress/producer ) and I (director) are both from Wisconsin. We connected through a mutual friend a year ago and our passion for film and creating made it inevitable that a collaboration between the two of us had to happen. I've already had the opportunity to gain a name and following for myself with my web series, Harley Quinn. I've gained over 12,000 subscribers proving that I have a great understanding of how to engage an audience.I've also had the privilege to work on TV shows such as Atlanta and Legion, and worked with companies such as DJI and Bleacher Report. Dot McDonald has produced shows for Issa Rae's Youtube channel &amp; keeps the people laughing in Buzzfeed videos. One in which went viral receiving over 30 million views.  Together we've laid out our best ideas on the table and combined our strengths to give you something unique and alluring.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Campaign</h3>
<p>Our campaign will run for 30 days. During this time, we will be in pre-production; holding auditions, scouting locations and building up momentum for our release. Influenced by movies like BELLY, Friday, and the TV series Power, we believe that the story of Noodles will resonate with our targeted demographic. Your contributions will play a crucial role in taking our film to the next level and assuring that there are no limitations to our vision. The money that we raise will go directly to actors, locations, equipment, crew, food, transportation, wardrobe, video post, audio post, music, insurance, legal, and marketing. Imagination Upgraded whole-heartedly believes in delivering high quality, and enticing work. With Noodles, we aim to exceed anything we've ever done!</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Coming from Wisconsin, we both feel a responsibility to not only represent our overlooked home state but also to instill inspiration in those who come from less.

</div></div>","The Team
Hey guys! Although we reside in Los Angeles, CA,  Dot (actress/producer ) and I (director) are both from Wisconsin. We connected through a mutual friend a year ago and our passion for film and creating made it inevitable that a collaboration between the two of us had to happen. I've already had the opportunity to gain a name and following for myself with my web series, Harley Quinn. I've gained over 12,000 subscribers proving that I have a great understanding of how to engage an audience.I've also had the privilege to work on TV shows such as Atlanta and Legion, and worked with companies such as DJI and Bleacher Report. Dot McDonald has produced shows for Issa Rae's Youtube channel & keeps the people laughing in Buzzfeed videos. One in which went viral receiving over 30 million views.  Together we've laid out our best ideas on the table and combined our strengths to give you something unique and alluring.

 
The Campaign
Our campaign will run for 30 days. During this time, we will be in pre-production; holding auditions, scouting locations and building up momentum for our release. Influenced by movies like BELLY, Friday, and the TV series Power, we believe that the story of Noodles will resonate with our targeted demographic. Your contributions will play a crucial role in taking our film to the next level and assuring that there are no limitations to our vision. The money that we raise will go directly to actors, locations, equipment, crew, food, transportation, wardrobe, video post, audio post, music, insurance, legal, and marketing. Imagination Upgraded whole-heartedly believes in delivering high quality, and enticing work. With Noodles, we aim to exceed anything we've ever done!
. 

 
What We Need & What You Get
We need people who are excited about supporting new entrepreneurs and are eager to cheer on dream chasers. We need backers who can not only see our vision but can also see the greater picture. Your contributions will help create a film that celebrates all truths. A film that says all walks of life deserve to be told. A series that will empower our women to find independence in this world and get it on their own!
Because Noodles wouldn't be anything without you, Imagination Upgraded has created some awesome perks that will allow you to get an exclusive experience to our process and see exactly how your contributions will be put to use.

The Impact
Coming from Wisconsin, we both feel a responsibility to not only represent our overlooked home state but also to instill inspiration in those who come from less. We want to motivate those back home and be proof that they can truly do anything. Noodles is a film that will force our viewers to evaluate their relationships, understand different motives for joining the street life and allow people to adventure on a journey they may never step foot on. Noodles is a film that gives a voice to the stories that are neglected. It's a reveal of a reality that seldom gets brought to the light.

<h3>Introducing us</h3>
<p>The video you see there is Episode 1 of Melbourne Survivor: Warrandyte (Season 2)</p>
<p>Melbourne Survivor is like the reality show 'Survivor' but played over a single weekend in Melbourne. For the contestants it's like a small taste of what it would feel like to play Survivor. </p>
<p>Our host and editor, Liz, started things back in 2018 with Season 1 which she hosted over 12 hours in a local park. It was filmed &amp; edited by a friend into a 30 minute video which was shown at a Survivor-themed 21st birthday. Being part of a 21st celebration was a great reason to get people trying something they otherwise might not have done. </p>
<p>Realising what was possible, Liz got together with some Season 1 contestants and started planning for Season 2 - this time over a weekend. Many emails, a Kickstarter campaign and a lot of Facebook posts later, Season 2 happened in a scout park in Warrandyte. It was a hectic week leading up to it with cast and crew pulling out and last minute replacements being found, as well as a stressful Friday picking up hired filming lights in the city - but it was a fantastic season and the weekend format proved to be pretty great, as every person got the chance to have a Survivor-y experience of sleeping on the ground, getting enough time to strategise and make friendships without so much time as to have major ill will or bitterness from being voted out. </p>
<p>The only thing missing was fire. That and some better visual and audio equipment. Also more an even male to female ratio, and more crew who were willing to </p>
<p>Now, we have all of that. (except we still have way less female applicants than male, women please apply) Because we're planning for October or more likely April because the Covid situation is not so great, we won't be in the fire restriction months and so instead of spending time putting cellophane in torches we'll be researching fire safety. Contestants will be cooking rice on a fire which they'll start themselves and when they get voted out a torch filled with fire will be snuffed. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Here's what we need funds for:</p>
<ul>
<li>$660 for buffs - we will reuse some of these for our trial games (same thing over a day, not filmed)</li>
<li>$189 or more for Public Liability Insurance - if we postpone to April we will have to rearrange or seek new cover. </li>
<li>$250 minimum for campsite booking. This depends on the amount of people present. It is likely to be more expensive if we have to change location by postponing the event. </li>
<li>$100 for props such as replacing broken buckets, balance beams, torches, permanent markers etc.</li>
<li>$85 for lighting hire</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Some of this is covered by previous buff purchases and we're grateful that food is being covered by the Reilly family. Some very keen production members have also used the lockdown period as a time to construct challenges at their own expense. The contestant fee goes straight to accommodation</p>
<p>If we have extra funds that means we can do a whole lot more. We can purchase or hire more filming equipment, to create a better result for viewers and an easier editing process for us. We can also create ads to get more traction and find people willing to help out or apply. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Without supporters we can't run the event. We're not a business, we don't have investors. Any money we need that isn't raised comes from our own pockets and those pockets do have limits. </p>
<p>Ultimately our goals with all of this are:</p>
<ul>
<li>to bring people together who wouldn't otherwise have met, forming significant friendships</li>
<li>to create a fun experience for everyone, including people who watch it on YouTube</li>
<li>to encourage people to get out of their comfort zone and try something new</li>
<li>promoting the idea of getting back to nature for a bit and taking a break from technology</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>While we have some really cool Survivor challenges, we also have some planning challenges, the main one being dealing with Covid. We would prefer to <strong>postpone</strong> rather than attempting to enforce precautions that would be near impossible to follow. Of course we won't be able to run the event if it is illegal to do so, but <strong>we also will not run the event if we believe it is unsafe.</strong></p>
<p>This means it could very well take a long time for Season 3 to happen. However, the longer it's delayed the better it will be. </p>
<p>The reason why we can still aim for <strong>October or April</strong> is that it will be outside and with a relatively small number of people. We will be prepared with hand sanitiser for everyone, cast replacements, change of format, and a refund and spot in a future season if someone who has been cast gets sick before the event. </p>
<p>There will also be a <strong>no-whispering rule</strong>, not just because talking right up to someone's face is not a good thing to do even if cases are lowered, but also because it's a pain to edit a narrative when you have no idea what people are saying. </p>
<p>The risks as you can see are health and safety related. There are precautions we need to take as we <strong>use fire for the first time</strong>, and will be guided by the scout park mangagers/rangers in doing so. If we are unable to book our preferred location for April we may go back to Clifford Park which will be a bit more expensive but also more familiar. </p>
<p>There is also a <strong>mental health risk </strong>in playing a social strategy game like Survivor. People will be lying and voting people out, and things can be hard afterwards particularly for people voted out early or those who weren't perceived how they thought they would be. In our experience the short time span and lack of focus on prize money helps with this as people aren't too invested in the game but rather can enjoy the experience.</p>
<p>This is also why no one gets voted out until after the first night, so that everyone still gets a solid Survivor experience. Upon being voted out contestants still get to watch challenges and tribal councils and crew members are open to discussing what's been happening. They understand as most of them have played games like this before. </p>
<p>There's also always a chance that <strong>something could go wrong with footage</strong>, a laptop could die or a hard drive or SD card could go missing. It was actually kind of a miracle that all we had to deal with for Warrandyte was 2 missing camera angles at Tribal Council, considering the laptop used to edit is 5+ years old and fell down 2 concrete steps once. <strong>This time there is much less chance of that happening </strong>as we just have more people involved and more contingency plans. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute financially, don't worry! There are still valuable ways you can help:</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Cornell Thomas. I'm a father, husband, author, speaker, and social entrepreneur from New Jersey. I travel all over the world sharing my story of overcoming adversity, chasing dreams, and finding purpose. I was raised in a single family home (my father passed when I was 3) by my mother the great Tina Thomas. She raised five of us with very little money. So who I am is a direct result of who she is. We were taught that if you don't like something don't sit around and complain about it just go out and fix it. You see a problem find the solution, and I have a big problem.</p>
<p>Non-Fiction television SUCKS!! Yes there are some pretty good shows out there, but for the most part we are inundated with crap. Every night we have to sit through another ""reality"" show where drama is the main focus. It's all scripted nonsense (I mean seriously how many arguments can you have at the dinner table) Why don't we ever see the good that happens in our world? Why are we force fed all the negativity? This is why this show is so important.</p>
<p>Each episode I will be traveling the world and interviewing ""ordinary"" people doing extraordinary things for humanity.  During the episode you will be able to support their causes, and help them help others. I want to bring a positive light to all the darkness we're seeing on television right now. I want to show my kids, and the next generation that they don't have to repeat the cycle. That they can be the change this world so desperately needs</p>

<h3>What We Need To Make It Happen</h3>

<p>Cost of 100 hours of editing: 7500K</p>

<p>Spread the word!!!! We all have people that we know that want to make a difference. Usually they're not sure how. All it takes is $5, share it with the world my friends!!! </p>

I want to bring a positive light to all the darkness we're seeing on television right now. I want to show my kids, and the next generation that they don't have to repeat the cycle. That they can be the change this world so desperately needs

What We Need To Make It Happen
The cost of shooting both the pilot and the first episode is 45K. Yes 45,000 dollars, and you might be asking yourself what does that COVER. Well here's the information you need:
Cost of a 3 man camera crew for a 15 day shoot: 12K 
Cost of 100 hours of editing: 7500K
Travel Expenses: (For Three People/Pilot Episode) 2K
Cost of entertainment lawyer: 15K
Cost of Venue For Fall Premiere Event: 8K

Your Contribution
There is a reason that anyone that contributes gets something in return. Because every single person that does is saying they are ready for a change. I have never been someone that talks about doing something, I'm about action, and you contributing to this cause shows me that you are too. Thank you so much for making this dream come to fruition. We love you all!!
Risk vs Reward
There are always risk when you are chasing a dream, but they pale in comparison to all of us sitting in front of a large movie screen and watching OUR show ""On Purpose"" will help change the landscape of the television world as we know it.

<h3>About Me and My Project</h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Hello! My name is Rachel Gordine and I am a student at The New York Film Academy where I am working towards a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Acting. This is my final semester, so I am tasked in creating a web series pilot. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My web series, <i>The </i><i>Apple Pie Affliction</i>, is about Elizabeth, a senior in high school who is completely alone. Her only escape is music, and that is what she plans to use to get out of her small town and to a place where she is surrounded by people who accept her.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I am from a small town of 8,000 in Nebraska, and while I didn't feel isolated like Elizabeth, I felt that in order to chase my dream I needed to leave. This story is very close to me and combines various truths in my life as well as fiction. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">​This is a great </span>opportunity<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> for me to showcase my writing, acting, and music skills. It also has a great message that everyone can understand.  </span></p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;'>What We Need </span></p>
</div><div>
<p>We need funding for the project as a whole. This will include funding for my talented crew, cast, and locations. Our budget of $2,500 will allow us to produce a professional pilot, which will give us a better opportunity to produce the rest of the series. </p>

<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: bold;letter-spacing: 0px;'>So What Do You Get?</span></p>
<p>We have many perks that vary by your contribution. Since Elizabeth, our main character, loves music, we have covers of songs available. I have been playing instruments since I was 4 years old, and have been singing for just as long. I would love to give you a gift that I personally create to show you how much I appreciate your contribution.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project has a great message. It tells people that they are never truly alone and not to be afraid of chasing your dreams. This is a message that is for everyone!</p>
<p>It also has a message against bullying. In school, no matter how much we try to preach bullying is bad, it happens anyway. I can remember having speakers come and talk about it and watching boring informational videos about it. I think that putting this message in an entertaining show, which would be on the internet, in a quick video will help kids accept the message. It is in a format that is really understood and used by them. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to learn about our new amazing project, <i><strong>""Unstable!""</strong></i> Our show is about two people learning how to deal with things thrown at them, day by day. Getting tested and still working on being their best selves! We're telling a story of growth. Taking situations that may seem unfortunate and always fight to find the positive in them.

We're so excited to share our truths with you and give you guys some giggles! This campaign is to help pay the amazing people who decided they believe in this, and us. They took a leap of faith by giving us something precious, their time. We're dedicated to using it to make something great happen! We can't wait to show you guys what we've got cooking over here!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We've set our goal at $10,000, but of course every donation matters! This money is going to be used in many spectacular ways.</p>
<p>We'll be using the funds raised for locations, production design, equipment, wardrobe, transport and of course to pay and feed our awesome cast and crew! </p>

<p>We have also added some awesome perks to bribe you all and thank you for helping us create this story.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Unstable is my baby. It's ready to start crawling, walking, and eventually one day running. With your help we will be able to achieve this. You have no idea how much your contribution means to me, and the impact it will have on my journey as a storyteller. It will be forever appreciated! We hope you will join us and be part of helping this beautiful project grow. You never know how strong you are until you need to be!</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div><p>As this is based on our personal journey navigating the ""Hollywood Hills and valleys,"" The most important thing is keeping the story honest, authentic, and fun! This is a slice of life from the bigger pie filled with the tantalizing tease of tinsel town...(whatever that is!) The story itself is powerful, encouraging and depressingly hilarious. I have no doubt we can help change the world if we take our time, have patience, and always do our best!</p></div><div>

<h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3>
<p>Filtered Water is a web series about an all girls high school swim team and their conversations that occur while stretching before practice. The oddities and seriousness of topics spoken during stretches is a fond memory for Dir. Dannah Eckhardt; she can distinctly remember hearing one of her teammates say loudly in front of the entire co-ed swim team, “My uterus hurts so much!” This series follows those moments of outrageous --- honesty? The series is about what it means to be a young woman and have your voiced denied as being “dramatic” or “silly” and the struggles this then causes when trying to find the courage to take action.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is $500 which will go to helping the project reach festivals. We have some great perks including a poster, a social media shoutout, and IMBD credit!</p>

<p>A bit about us and the project:</p>

<p>Director: La’Perria Harvin BA, AMPAS, production work from Philadelphia to Los Angeles podcasting as well as live events.</p>
<p>Producer and Top Billing Actor: Reginald Darby: Serious Actor with numerous credits as well as an established comedian.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This project is us taking action to bring to fruition a vision of the director. From inception to completion, this is a project from the minds of creatives and we have the passion to see this project through. Contributors will help young creatives continue their path and dream of creative new ways of expression and storytelling told from a BIPOC viewpoint.</p>
<p>We will continue to produce great works, made by people of colour. We are seeking to raise 5K to complete this pilot to be distributed to locations fees, casting fees, production- pre and post costs, crafty (nourishment) and promotional costs.</p>
<p>We anticipate reaching our goal, however if we don't the funds will still be allocated properly between order of importance of completing this pilot project.</p>
<p>We want to continue to produce more work and show those that have hopes and dreams that they too can achieve them.</p>
<p>As producers, actors and directors our time in the business, we understand the hard work, planning, and flexibility needed to complete a project like this. We are no longer bound by issues with filming. We are solution based and will see this project through.</p>
<p>Challenges are filming through this pandemic, however all precaution and safety measures will be taken. As we branch off and begin to create projects on our own, asking for monetary assistance is helpful.</p>
<p>Please make sure to spread this word to thoughts that are in production, those that like to help, those that watch tv and those that genuinely would like to help break generational curses. </p>

We felt  that we were onto something special back then, and judging by the positive feedback, it resonated with many viewers. Our <strong>TARGET GOAL</strong> is to raise $25000 to produce the first 6 webisodes of Season 1 and word on the street is you want in on the action. Today, the cost to produce a broadcast quality web series with professional actors and crew is roughly $1500 to $2000 per minute. That's a lotta cheddar. We believe we can achieve the same look for half of that. Are we overambitious? Maybe. Crazy? Fuggedaboudit!

Sit down (but not there, that's the good couch) and stay awhile. Last year, a bunch of us got together and shot a 2 minute proof of concept demo which you can watch below. We felt  that we were onto something special back then, and judging by the positive feedback, it resonated with many viewers. Our TARGET GOAL is to raise $25000 to produce the first 6 webisodes of Season 1 and word on the street is you want in on the action. Today, the cost to produce a broadcast quality web series with professional actors and crew is roughly $1500 to $2000 per minute. That's a lotta cheddar. We believe we can achieve the same look for half of that. Are we overambitious? Maybe. Crazy? Fuggedaboudit! With your involvement and generous donations, we're confident we can reach our goal and maybe then some, but before you dip into your wallets and purses, let me introduce you to our amazing TEAM: _____________________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________________________We are also very lucky and grateful to have some of Canada's finest actors in the supporting roles, like MARIA VACRATSIS - (Mama Mia - Here We Go Again), as Mob Boss Mrs. Scrota, MICHAEL MIRANDA - (Saw V) as Father Romano, DAN LETT - (The Shape of Water), MARY LONG - (Come Dance With Me), MELISSA D'AGOSTINO - (Tactical Girls), ALIA DeSANTIS - (Impulse) and MAURICE DEAN WINT - (Her Stolen Past) to name a few._____________________________________________________________________________________ On your right, you'll see a list of cool perks we're offering, depending on the size of your contribution.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, and thanks for at least looking at our crowdfunder!  You've made it this far, so that means we've basically already gotten your money, but in case we haven't, let's tell you a bit about us!</p>
<p>Aspire Productions is an independent production company based out of Northwest Indiana AKA The Region (AKA the county that has Gary, IN for you people not from around here).  For four years Aspire's been making shorts and comedy sketches in our free time, but our goal has always been to bring The Collector to life.</p>
<p>So what is The Collector?  The Collector is a web series about a man--known only as the Collector--who works for an agency that is contracted by criminals to collect debts as loan sharks and ""tie up loose ends"" (Kill them).  The Collector's been in production for four years.  We even shot an original pilot that was just so awful we needed to destroy it, rewrite, recast, and try again.  So that's what you're seeing now!</p>
<p>The Collector's universe that we constructed is vast, and there are plenty of colorful characters we want to bring to your screens.  Your contributions to this crowdfunder will allow us to create the very first 6 webisode season independently so that we can begin to garner interest for a full web series.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So why do we need money?!  Well if you didn't watch that video at the top with our little introduction, we'll break it down very simply for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Equipment Rentals:  This is probably the biggest one.  We have one decent camera, and a few lights amongst ourselves, but things that need to be rented will be dollys, jibs, better lights, better lenses; basically we need the type of equipment that will make it seem less like a student film and more like a professional web series.</li>
<li>Props:  We went through two pistols when we shot the original pilot of The Collector.  Those airsoft guns are so fragile.  To ensure we're not wasting money, we're going to need quality props.  And not just guns, we'll also need various props and set dressing to make each scene feel real (we have an episode with a creepy organ harvester that will need medical equipment, for example).</li>
<li>Cast Fees &amp; Transportation:  Actors always expect to be paid, at least for gas which is just the biggest inconvenience.  Unfortunately we need them, and since we're in the suburbs and a lot of our cast comes from Chicago or Indianapolis, we'll need to pay for them to get out here.</li>
<li>On Set Meals:  We'll be pulling long days to ensure all 6 episodes get filmed before August, so we're going to need to feed our cast and crew during those days.</li>
</ul>
<p>So you know why we need our money, but what's in it for you?  Well, you get an awesome web series of course!  Wait, that's not enough?  Crap.  Well we made up some perks that don't include you getting a Skype meeting with a couple of nobodies or getting an executive producer credit that you probably didn't care about.</p>
<ul>
<li>At $5 you get a shout-out on social media and your name in the credits of each episode.  It's 5 bucks, what'd you expect?</li>
<li>At $25 you get a digital download of the complete first season.  Better yet, you get those digital downloads one week before each episode comes out.  (Plus above perks)</li>
<li>At $50 you get a Blu-ray of the complete first season with bonus features AND a poster of the official cover of The Collector Blu-ray.  (Plus above perks)</li>
<li>At $100 you get a fancy pants t-shirt, and a walk-on extra role (if you want it).  (Plus above perks)</li>
<li>At $250 (only one of these), you get to help us create a character that The Collector kills.  You can even play him/her!  How cool would it be to be killed by our Collector?  (Plus above perks)</li>
</ul>
<p>This all sounds great so far, right?  But what happens if we don't reach our goal?  Well, we'll still go forward with the six episodes, but we can't guarantee what the quality's gonna be like out of this one.  $2000 is our bare minimum</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The indie film industry in Northwest Indiana continues to grow every day.  One of the great things that we aim to do with The Collector is spotlight iconic NWI areas, and let is secondarily serve as a sort of love letter to the area.  Not to mention, so many people have invested so much time, energy, and money into this project already (on the prologue alone!).  Why not help us finish it up?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With filming independently (and not, to be honest) there's always the risk of unpredictable variables ruining a shoot.  Anyone who's filmed knows this and--most importantly here--we know this.  We've run into pretty much every problem possible, and we've become experts at working around them.</p>
<p>So here's what we're saying:  No matter what risks hit us, we WILL power through to ensure you all get the best series that you paid for.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>SHARE SHARE SHARE SHARE!</p>
<p>Seriously, we of all people totally understand coming across a cool crowdfunder that we simply can't afford to support.  That's why we put up a $1 option to just give what you can!  Plus, share!  Tell your friends, tell your family, tell the world!  We want to make sure everyone knows about The Collector by the end of this campaign!</p>

A funny, heartfelt, LGBTQ+ inclusive series that will mix two of our most beloved mediums; film and podcasts.</strong></h3><p>Story and Film Crew Academy have been working together on Gotland for years. Writing and producing a TV show each year is a staple of their collaboration and education. The shows that have been made through the years range from sitcoms to action, from comedy to the most dramatic of dramas.</p><p>This year we’re making an emotional rollercoaster of a show. It’s low-key, it’s personal, and most of all: it’s an unapologetic queer love story without dramatic ""coming-out"" arcs, without explicit and violent homophobia. It’s simply two people falling in love.</p><p>Inspiration can be found in the Scandinavian hits Skam &amp; Sjukt Oklar, as well as American shows such as Shrill, Modern Love, &amp; Dear White People. </p><p>However, money makes the world go round, as we all know, and to make sure Sweet Talk lives up to our ambitions, we need more capital.

Gabriella isn’t quite as passionate but is okay with being dragged along to talk about Jonathan, her long-term boyfriend, as Frida goes on and on about her dates.</p><p>However, everything changes when Jonathan suddenly dumps Gabriella.</p><p>Old feelings between the two women resurface and a whirlwind romance between Frida and Gabriella begins on the heels of the break-up, throwing the whole dynamic of the podcast for a loop.</p><p>This will be the start of a passionate, complicated relationship where Gabriella quickly realizes that Frida is the one who she wants to be with. But Frida, who has secretly loved Gabriella since high school, quickly finds herself fumbling, having gone from pining in secret while dating every girl within a 20-mile radius to having the woman of her dreams.</p><p>It does not get any easier when Jonathan soon realizes that he has made the mistake of his life and wants Gabriella back. At the same time Billie, a nationally known radio celebrity,  discovers Frida and Sweet Talk and attempts to bring her to Stockholm, a city of possibilities.</p><p>In the end, it's all about choices. Will Frida opt-out of her new relationship with Gabriella for Billie and a brilliant podcast career? Will Gabriella dare to invest in Frida, or go back to the security of Jonathan?

Gotlands Folkhögskola is quickly becoming one of the top Film Schools in the country and is placed just a stone's throw from Ingmar Bergman's Fårö.

It's being written and produced in collaboration with Story Academy and Film Crew Academy at Gotlands Folkhögskola. A funny, heartfelt, LGBTQ+ inclusive series that will mix two of our most beloved mediums; film and podcasts.Story and Film Crew Academy have been working together on Gotland for years. Writing and producing a TV show each year is a staple of their collaboration and education. The shows that have been made through the years range from sitcoms to action, from comedy to the most dramatic of dramas.This year we’re making an emotional rollercoaster of a show. It’s low-key, it’s personal, and most of all: it’s an unapologetic queer love story without dramatic ""coming-out"" arcs, without explicit and violent homophobia. It’s simply two people falling in love.Inspiration can be found in the Scandinavian hits Skam & Sjukt Oklar, as well as American shows such as Shrill, Modern Love, & Dear White People. However, money makes the world go round, as we all know, and to make sure Sweet Talk lives up to our ambitions, we need more capital. We want to make sure art, actors, editing, and music.... well, all of it. We want it all to be the best it can possibly be.Help us make it so.Frida, an openly mega proud, lesbian, is stuck. In life, in love, and on the island of Gotland. Together with her best friend Gabriella, she runs the podcast Sweet Talk - A podcast about sex & relationships that she hopes will grow and kickstart her career. Gabriella isn’t quite as passionate but is okay with being dragged along to talk about Jonathan, her long-term boyfriend, as Frida goes on and on about her dates.However, everything changes when Jonathan suddenly dumps Gabriella.Old feelings between the two women resurface and a whirlwind romance between Frida and Gabriella begins on the heels of the break-up, throwing the whole dynamic of the podcast for a loop.This will be the start of a passionate, complicated relationship where Gabriella quickly realizes that Frida is the one who she wants to be with. But Frida, who has secretly loved Gabriella since high school, quickly finds herself fumbling, having gone from pining in secret while dating every girl within a 20-mile radius to having the woman of her dreams.It does not get any easier when Jonathan soon realizes that he has made the mistake of his life and wants Gabriella back. At the same time Billie, a nationally known radio celebrity,  discovers Frida and Sweet Talk and attempts to bring her to Stockholm, a city of possibilities.In the end, it's all about choices. Will Frida opt-out of her new relationship with Gabriella for Billie and a brilliant podcast career? Will Gabriella dare to invest in Frida, or go back to the security of Jonathan? And are they both willing to compromise their own dreams to make each other happy?The crew consists mostly of current or former students and we hire established directors, directors of photography, actors, production designers, composers, sound engineers, and so on. All these people need to be paid because no one should work for free in any industry.Your money would go directly towards all parts of production but most importantly:
Art-department (costume, make-up, paint, props)
Food (craft services is KEY to a successful production!)
Post-production (software to work remotely, royalties, fees)
Travel and Covid safety.
We want to make sure the story is told, but most of all that it’s told well and safely. Sure, the vaccine is just within reach but we’re still doing our best to be as prepared as possible, with or without it. Travel is always tricky, but during these times we need to take extra precautions to get people from mainland Sweden to Gotland. Therefore, most of our budget is for travel, to keep our options open and to keep everyone as safe as possible.Okay but if I contribute, what do I get? Just some of the most awesome perks around! Everything from your name in the credits, signed posters, and stickers to an invitation to our premiere, a guided tour of the second biggest studio in Sweden, and a co-producer credit!Sweet Talk takes place on Gotland, a beautiful island off the Swedish east coast. The show will highlight the gorgeous setting as well as make use of the incredible film talent that resides here, students and non-students alike.And about us? We’re a group of people, of all ages, from all over the world, with a passion for telling inclusive stories. Gotlands Folkhögskola is quickly becoming one of the top Film Schools in the country and is placed just a stone's throw from Ingmar Bergman's Fårö. Our classroom is the second biggest studio in Sweden and our lecturers include icons such as Chris Vogler and Cecilia Iversen. As mentioned above, every year Film crew Academy and Story Academy make a web series, led by a fearless showrunner. The students are mentored by established professionals. The showrunner, in this case, Evelina Saulo, is experienced in running a team and a production.We’ll be sure to introduce you to our entire crew at a later date. For now, here’s our cast:We get it.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In this pilot episode, four college student documentarians from 1985 get zapped to modern day via time traveling, shape shifting couch. What do a narcissistic director, apathetic rebel, timid outsider, raging party-goer, and aspiring bee-keeper/musician have in common? Not much. The show follows this motley crew on their journey to find a bridge back to their home decade, until things go awry when the gang has different ideas on how they want to handle the situation.</p>
<p>We drew inspiration from not only 1980s aesthetic for how the production will be edited, but we also wanted to incorporate some of the campy and exaggerated humor that comes from 1980s films and series. Combine these with both modern day and a couch that breaks all laws of physics, and you've got <i>That's a Warp! </i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>TV production is expensive, folks. Here's what your glorious funds will go to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u>Pre-production:</u> This includes things such as buying costumes and props. Thrift shopping exists, but it all adds up. We can't have kids from the 80's dressed in Yeezy's or the like. We have to keep things within their realm. Remember IZOD shirts? Excessive Denim? Leather jackets with safety pins? Those sorts of things. As for props, let's just say we need Play-Doh. Maybe a police baton. We won't include spoilers, so just trust us.</li>
<li>
<u>Equipment Rental:</u> Here's where the bulk of your money is going to go. This show is made by lower-division students at UT Austin, which means we can't rent equipment from the school for free yet, so we have to go to outside rental companies. Expensive equipment rental rate <i>x</i> each day <i>x</i> several weekends of filming = <i>pricey.</i> </li>
<li>
<u>Craft Services and Travel:</u> Our crew is comprised of students working on their own time. We are not able to pay them (although we'd love to, because they ROCK) so the least we can do is feed them. Also, gas prices may be better than they were in 2012, but we are a bunch of broke college students who could use your help.</li>
</ul>
<p>No donation is too small. Just like the prices of our needs, your donations all add up. And the great and exciting part is that there's stuff in it for you, too! Check out the <u>Perks</u> section of the page!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As lower-division college students looking to gain experience, the opportunity itself is incredibly rewarding for all of us. To even create this TV show, our three executives (wannabe screenwriters) had to apply to a writing class along with 60+ other people. 20 of those applicants were accepted into the class, then we had to pitch 2 ideas each. Out of those pitches, ours was selected, and <i>That's a Warp!</i> was born. We wrote a script, assembled a crew, and the rest is thanks to you.</p>
<p>Creating the show is a beast within itself, since none of us are professionals or advanced students. However, we're a talented and hardworking bunch that wants to create the best production we can. We enjoy coming up with cheap and creative solutions, but in some areas, we could really use an extra boost. Not only would you be supporting student television, but you'd be giving us opportunity leading to experience, which only helps us in the long run! Remember, this is a TV pilot, meaning it's the first episode of a series. You can say YOU were with us from the beginning, and helped gave the show its start.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>Together with his wife Laurie, Jay has been leading development events on the hallowed fields of America’s largest battlefield, Gettysburg, for two decades.  A 20 year Air Force veteren, Lorenzen's interest in Gettysburg and the Civil War was ignited when he was a professor at that Air Force Academy, fueled by the Turner Movie, <i>Gettysburg</i>, and enlightened by his studies in biblical leadership. </p>
<p>After decades of walking the fields with developing leaders, Jay describes Gettysburg is one of those “thin-places” where the temporal and the eternal are uniquely connected.  </p>

<p>Thomas Merton was a strong believer in pilgrimages and the spirituality of place.  He was drawn to sacred sites, not because he knew the places but because he believed the places knew him.</p>
<p>Gettysburg is one of these sacred places.  The “storied geography” of Gettysburg speaks to the heart.  It’s a place not only to study leadership, but also to experience “where great things were done for us (Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain).”  </p>

The High Ground at Gettysburg conference  is the best personal and leadership development experience I have been a part of. Jay and Laurie create a learning environment that is second to none... I have been to the conference 5 times. I love to bring colleagues and friends and each time they thank me for doing so. 
-- Andy Wineman, Pastor
 
PRODUCTION VALUES

As of the launch of this campaign, the team is overseas finishing up filming of the feature, Sabina: Tortured for Christ - the Nazi Years.
 
JAY LORENZEN

 

 
Together with his wife Laurie, Jay has been leading development events on the hallowed fields of America’s largest battlefield, Gettysburg, for two decades.  A 20 year Air Force veteren, Lorenzen's interest in Gettysburg and the Civil War was ignited when he was a professor at that Air Force Academy, fueled by the Turner Movie, Gettysburg, and enlightened by his studies in biblical leadership. 
After decades of walking the fields with developing leaders, Jay describes Gettysburg is one of those “thin-places” where the temporal and the eternal are uniquely connected.  
 

“In sacred places, something gets done to you that you’ve been unable to do for yourself.”  -- Thomas Merton
Thomas Merton was a strong believer in pilgrimages and the spirituality of place.  He was drawn to sacred sites, not because he knew the places but because he believed the places knew him.
Gettysburg is one of these sacred places.  The “storied geography” of Gettysburg speaks to the heart.  It’s a place not only to study leadership, but also to experience “where great things were done for us (Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain).”

My name is Gina Etlinger, and I am the creator, writer, and soon-to-be director of “Real Adult.” The original pilot for “Real Adult” was my full length, senior thesis at The University of the Arts two years ago, where I received my BFA in Writing for Film and Television. I was awarded the Philadelphia Women in Film and Television Writing Award for my work on the pilot of ""Real Adult"".  Who could pass up on that kind of validation? I know this script and this world like the back of my hand. In a huge way, it is my life. And I want it to be a part of your lives as well.  </p><p><strong>What's the Story?</strong></p><p>“Real Adult” is a dramedy that follows six friends in Philadelphia who have just graduated college: Chloe, Rachel, Gab, Matt, Nick, and Robby. They’ve managed to fool themselves into thinking that they know what adulthood is until they realize how not prepared for “adult life” they really are. The group of friends experiences different struggles: their fifth consecutive existential crisis, paying rent with no money, or losing someone they thought they’d always have. Throughout our five episodes, the friends will unravel themselves and the world around them as they struggle to make sense of life now that it’s time to figure it out. Each character is diverse in race and sexuality, and I’m hoping to achieve a broad spectrum of representation while telling stories that are relatable to any person in their early twenties, especially the LGBTQIA community. “Real Adult” presents an important reality: adults with adult responsibilities who don’t feel like adults at all.</p><p><strong>What makes “Real Adult” unique?</strong></p><p>The series is deeply connected to the LGBTQIA community in Philadelphia. I'm very passionate about my community and connecting to people through my writing. My main goal was to include and show off what I love about Philadelphia and the people in their early-mid 20s that thrive and struggle here. The creative community of Philadelphia is booming, and this is how I intend to tap into that. I don’t believe there is a series that presents an accurate representation of having the rug pulled out from under you when you graduate college. Especially, when others are making it work and you can barely get out of bed.</p><p><strong>The Format</strong></p><p>Since September, I've turned the pilot into smaller webisodes.

The web-series offers a major contrast, and now more than ever, it’s the time of web content. I believe that the web series format is a strong vehicle for new talent and innovative screenwriting and that our web series offers a fresh, authentic take that our audiences, particularly the LGBTQIA community, will appreciate. These characters represent us, as so-called millennials, written by the person having these experiences. It puts an emphasis on real life while meeting the necessary dramatic and comedic elements.</p><p><strong>Why Indiegogo?</strong></p><p>Filmmaking is a costly process and it’s easy to get discouraged, quitting before you even start.

<h3>About ""The Conspiracy Theorists""</h3>
<p>My name is Stephen Bittrich, the writer/creator of THE CONSPIRACY THEORISTS, and on behalf of myself and my co-executive producer, David Marantz, we'd like to thank you for coming to our Indiegogo campaign!</p>
<p>I am a playwright/screenwriter, and I had been writing a web series for some time when Covid-19 began to appear.  At first I was like, ""Well, maybe I can adapt slightly... oh... no... I'm done... and I have to stay home!""<br/><br/>I started writing this new series, inspired by the feeling of uncertainty that seemed to overwhelm everyone as we all were forced into isolation by the pandemic.  Soon there was lots of content being shared that was created on videoconference apps - playreadings and performances and such. Artists connecting on video while staying home. The idea for this series was to create something where the videoconference aspect was part of the conceit... instead of, ""We're doing a reading of Hamlet... really suspend your disbelief, okay?"" -- this series is “Here’s a show about people who only meet online in a videoconference app.""</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Contribute?</h3>
<p>I lived in New York City for 26 years.  (I'm in Austin now.). When Covid-19 hit New York hard, I called my artist buddies in New York, and they were really struggling.  Their work was mostly gone unless they were lucky enough to have some voice over work.  Traditional survival jobs like catering, gone.<br/><br/>I called Dave, who had helped to produce and starred in another webseries I wrote called Off Off.  He was game and ready, and so we were off to the races.</p>
<p>Many of us met through our theater home, The Drilling Company, Hamilton Clancy Artistic Director (and cast member of this show).  I wanted to create something to give us that sense of community that we have in the theater, now lost as we all are sequestered in our homes; a way to gather our talented buddies, create story, entertain people, give them a few laughs, bond with each other in creation, and and lift all our spirits. If we can also collect some donations to help the artists meet basic needs now and in the near future, that would be great, too.</p>
<p>The show is free for anyone who wants to watch it.  We're going to make it no matter what we raise.  But, if you are in a position at this time to help the artists and contribute what we're calling a ""tip"" for our hard work, we really appreciate it.  We have 13 main cast members (a big cast) and other surprise actors to be added later.<br/><br/>We're doing what is called an In-Demand campaign.  We keep any money raised.  We've set an achievable goal, and if we reach it, we can continue to raise money beyond the end date of the campaign.  We would like to raise MORE than $1500, but we wanted to set a safe goal.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Artists</h3>
<p>We've assembled an amazing cast and crew.  Let's single out a couple of them for now... one of our cast members, Meghan McGeary, performs musically under the name, Amity Rose, and she wrote us an amazing theme song.  I was so happy with the theme song, I asked her if she could write another SURPRISE song for another episode.  What she came up with is my new favorite song.  You are going to be so amazed when it comes out!  I can't say more....</p>
<p>Another of our accomplished actors, Brian Dykstra, has written plays produced around the US, performs Slam Poetry, performed on Broadway with the great Brian Cox, but he may go down in history for his part in one of the Dave Chappelle Show's most famous skits.  Look up ""Clayton Bigsby, the World’s Only Black White Supremacist - Chappelle’s Show"" on YouTube.  That's Brian at about the 4 minute mark.<br/><br/>Hamilton Clancy does not yet make his entrance in Episode 01, but look for him in Episode 02.  He has done guest starring roles in Orange Is the New Black, Mindhunter, One Dollar, Blue Bloods, among others.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Episode Frequency</h3>
<p>We are going to attempt to release and episode each week.  It's a lot of work!!  We will try our best to follow this schedule.  This will a be limited series.  So far just planning 1 season</p>
</div><div>

<h3>Hugging America from six feet away.</h3>
<p>We're going on tour! We'll be taping our podcast in some of our friends and listeners' driveways all over the country, and on the way, shooting all the footage for our new LIVE FROM [BLANK] web series (this is super exciting!!!).</p>
<p>We (Alison Burns and Lulu Picart) started our podcast in January of 2018, and since then have built a beautiful community. Since we can't tour in theaters this year, we're gonna take our show directly to our listeners. Like, right in their own driveway. With masks on  if they want. And probably lots of sanitizer. </p>
<p>To make this crazy weird tour happen, we need a little help with the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Renting a vehicle (because we want that maintenance package)</li>
<li>Renting equipment (we gotta make it look good!)</li>
<li>Paying a production manager and tour manager (that's just fair, right?)</li>
<li>Hiring a post-production team (if we raise enough money)</li>
<li>Food / gas / lodging for the trip (don't worry, we're keeping it cheap)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the course of three weeks, we're going to record tons of footage highlighting the uniqueness of towns and people across America, we'll visit our listeners and fans, and create a web series that aims to bring all of us together during this intense time. It's a love letter to our supporters and the people and places they love. </p>
<p>The only challenge we face is surviving three weeks in a vehicle together. But that's on us. </p>

<h3>A Brief History of The Pogo Adventure</h3>
<p>Pogoers have always connected through the internet. What began as a tiny collective of enthusiastic 'pogo kids' around the U.S. has expanded into a global extreme sport who's participants are largely limited to online interaction. Anyone who has experienced sports culture can understand that its followers are at their best when in the presence of one another - thus we have the Pogo Adventure. </p>
<p>The Pogo Adventure was born in 2009 when two top tier pogoers (Nick &amp; Fred) set off on an improvised road trip across America - their one goal; visit as many pogoers as possible and create a video series to share with the world.</p>
<p>Since that initial trip, The Pogo Adventure series has had five seasons all available online for free. Pogoing has also grown a great deal since that first trip, people are bouncing higher and doing crazier tricks than we could have ever imagined possible. So we're hitting the road again to capture the finest pogo action to ever go down, and share it all with you. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/2wU7mydLc5He0x7Zld/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>The 2018 Route</h3>
<p>This time around we're taking on the East Coast. The whole thing, Maine to Florida.</p>
<p style=""float:right;margin-left:25px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1523305992/bdgfszfef1v6foca3hmf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""float:leftt;"">We'll start our journey with a bang on May 25th in Philadelphia at the East Coast Pogo Meet, an invite-only street pogo competition that's sure to lead to some incredible pogoing. From there we'll be stopping in more major cities than ever on this route - that means bigger and better spots for street pogoing, jumping ledges, stair sets, and re-imagining the urban land scape. Between stops in the cities we'll be camping every night, taking in the fresh air and getting creative with whatever we can find to pogo on. Finally we'll make it to Key West, to pogo at the southernmost point in the United States.  </p>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>We've put together a team of a some of the most talented people to ever step foot on a pogo stick. This crew is not only at the cutting edge of the sport, but also well versed in video production with dozens of successful pogo video projects shot everywhere from Paris, to Hong Kong, Brazil, to Barcelona. </p>

</div></div>","A Brief History of The Pogo Adventure
Pogoers have always connected through the internet. What began as a tiny collective of enthusiastic 'pogo kids' around the U.S. has expanded into a global extreme sport who's participants are largely limited to online interaction. Anyone who has experienced sports culture can understand that its followers are at their best when in the presence of one another - thus we have the Pogo Adventure. 
The Pogo Adventure was born in 2009 when two top tier pogoers (Nick & Fred) set off on an improvised road trip across America - their one goal; visit as many pogoers as possible and create a video series to share with the world.
Since that initial trip, The Pogo Adventure series has had five seasons all available online for free. Pogoing has also grown a great deal since that first trip, people are bouncing higher and doing crazier tricks than we could have ever imagined possible. So we're hitting the road again to capture the finest pogo action to ever go down, and share it all with you. 

The 2018 Route
This time around we're taking on the East Coast. The whole thing, Maine to Florida.

We'll start our journey with a bang on May 25th in Philadelphia at the East Coast Pogo Meet, an invite-only street pogo competition that's sure to lead to some incredible pogoing. From there we'll be stopping in more major cities than ever on this route - that means bigger and better spots for street pogoing, jumping ledges, stair sets, and re-imagining the urban land scape. Between stops in the cities we'll be camping every night, taking in the fresh air and getting creative with whatever we can find to pogo on. Finally we'll make it to Key West, to pogo at the southernmost point in the United States.  
The Team
We've put together a team of a some of the most talented people to ever step foot on a pogo stick. This crew is not only at the cutting edge of the sport, but also well versed in video production with dozens of successful pogo video projects shot everywhere from Paris, to Hong Kong, Brazil, to Barcelona. 

Nick McClintock - Film maker and pogo veteran, the guy behind the previous Pogo Adventure edits

Dalton Smith - Reigning three time world champ and wizard with a camera.

Nic Patino - Killing it with the biggest street riding today and the man behind ECPM

Tone Staubs - Pogo Adventure veteran, king of grinds and cheesecakes 

Michael Mena - The world's highest front flipper and the O'est of the G's 

Henry Cabelus - A ball of energy ready to be unleashed any where + any time

Harry White - Canadian homie who will try anything for the hype

Tyler Phillips - Raw talent. Always flying high in the sky

Michael Brookhart - Xpogo intern with a cinematic eye. All around groovy pogo guy. 

Mystery Guests - We plan to meet up with as many pogoers as we can along the way!

Why We Need Your Help!
We need your help funding the travel costs of this adventure.
We'll be keeping costs as low as possible by camping every night we can and relying on a support network of fellow pogoers, but to get our crew the whole way down the coast we'll need to pay for some basic costs of being on the road.

Getting a large van back on the road and ready for the trip. 
We need to fuel three vehicles 
Pay for oil changes & emergency maintenance
Two or three nights in a hotel (for much needed warm showers)

<h2>Let's have a chin-wag (<i>a chat</i>)... </h2>
<p>Like a strong cup of tea, this project has been brewing for a while.</p>
<p>After moving from London to Los Angeles in 2010, I realized just how British I was. It's only until you leave your home do you realize who and what your comedy influences are. Basil Fawlty, French &amp; Saunders, Rik Mayell, Ricky Gervais, and Blackadder have all in their own way contributed to my sense of humo(u)r. Over the last few years, I went back to these roots and started to create a lot of characters from the UK, either with the Groundlings Sunday Company, or with close friends on sketch projects. It was during this weird and wonderful period of exploration that I created a blunt northern lass from England (Trudy Perkins). What better way to get her mingling with her neighbors than to throw her into the real estate market! It seemed like a beautiful combination; this bizarre, idiot, busy-body, trying to sell homes to her newly acquired community in Los Angeles. I am a huge fan of good ol' fashioned English farce, and I love a healthy dose of wit. I aim to squish both of these sensibilities together like a well-baked Jammy Dodger (<i>cookie</i>). </p>
<p>I plan to pitch this project to networks, and submit it to festivals as a Comedy Short. AND if I can make something that creates more jobs and opportunities for all of the talented people involved, then... it would be, quite simply, marvellous!  </p>
<p>I am so lucky to have a community of highly skilled friends and colleagues who are willing to give their time <i><strong>for free</strong></i> to make this project happen, and it would be wonderful to be able to pay them. </p>
</div><div>

<h3>The Telethon Show: A Summary</h3>
<p>Hello there, we're Cool Kid Comedy. And for the past seven years we've been performing around New York City, releasing sketch videos, and one of us even had a baby. But now we're doing something a little different.</p>
<p>We're producing a full length pilot and need your help to fund it. The show is called The Telethon Show, and is about a telethon that exists solely to raise money for the following week's episode of that very same show. It's a weird and hopefully humorous look at the classic Jerry Lewis style telethon, and it contains a mix of new and old Cool Kid Comedy sketches throughout.</p>
<p>We've been working on this project for over a year but there's still tons to be done, and that's where we could use your help. From production costs to festival entry fees, this whole project has been a slight drain on our personal bank accounts, which is why we hope that you can find it in your hearts to donate whatever amount you're able. Your donations will go towards offsetting everything from equipment rentals to craft services to jars of food for the aforementioned baby.</p>
<p>We sincerely thank you in advance for donating anything you can, and promise you that we're working hard to turn this show into something bigger. Whether that means making it a recurring web series, airing it on television, or a mystery third option that even we don't know yet, we hope that we can produce many more episodes of The Telethon Show down the line to entertain you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need And Where It's Going</h3>
<p>Our goal in this campaign is to raise $4,000. Your donations will help us to recoup our costs for renting equipment, paying crew, purchasing craft services, hiring editors, hiring talent, set decoration, purchasing props, and everything production-related under the sun.</p>
<p>In addition, our plan is to submit this project to countless festivals throughout the country, and your generous contributions will go towards our entry fees for those.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>We don't just want your money, but we want to give you things too as an additional thank you! By donating to this campaign, you can receive the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>$5 - An obligatory generic thank you</li>
<li>$10 - A personal heartfelt thank you</li>
<li>$20 - A digital copy of the pilot</li>
<li>$50 - A random headshot signed by Cool Kid Comedy</li>
<li>$100 - A special thank you in the show's credits</li>

<h3>Inspiration</h3>
<p><strong>I’m proud to be Haitian-American.</strong> Ever since I moved to LA from Florida I appreciate my family more and the things I took for granted.</p>
<p>In the entertainment industry appearance is everything. You have to know the right people and know how to package yourself.  You’ve got to look like somebody so that somebody might give you a chance. When you're not careful you can get lost in it. I find myself reflecting on my time at home because there’s comfort in remembering where I come from. When I remember what my grandparents and parents have overcome it serves as a reminder that I can make it on my own terms.</p>
<p>When I meet other Haitians in LA it’s a celebration in my heart. Four years ago, at the LA Film Festival, I met two Haitian-American artists and in that moment I got the idea for the web series. At the time I didn’t know exactly what it would be but I knew that I wanted to capture the resiliency and strength of our people.</p>
<p>Like the characters in the show I’m going to tap into what I have to make a mark.</p>

<h3>Beds: A web series</h3>
<p>What if a web series only took place in the bedroom? And what if we got to see a unique variety of relationships in it? Sure, romantic ones, but also familial dynamics and individual experiences?</p>
<p>Beds is here to deliver just that. From swanky studios to Airbnbs to childhood rooms revisited, Beds focuses on stripping away the outside world to reveal an honest, endearing and often funny look at what happens inside our most vulnerable spaces.</p>
<p>Each episode of Beds exists as an independent vignette intent on exploring the stories and characters we aren't likely to catch on primetime TV.</p>
<p>My name is Kirsten Shu-ying Chen and I'm the writer and creator of this series. And with the help of a fantastic team of creators - and hopefully you, dear contributor - I'm hoping to make something beautiful. Will you help us?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We're Asking For &amp; Why</h3>
<p>Our fundraising goal is $12,500. Here's where the money will go:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying cast &amp; crew </li>
<li>Renting and securing locations</li>
<li>Renting gear &amp; equipment</li>
<li>Making the show look and sound beautiful (think tech, music, props, costume etc.)</li>
<li>A VIEWING PARTY! And hopefully you'll be there.</li>
<li>Also, if we pull in at our target or higher, we may be able to film more than the four episodes we currently have planned.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Ultimately the purpose of Beds is to serve up great entertainment by exploring the unique people, relationships and stories we aren't accustomed to seeing on TV.</p>

<p>We are Coleman Films, the two brothers and amazing film crew that brought<br/>you ""Halloween Inferno"" and ""Inferno Part II"".  Our love for film making<br/>started at a very young age watching the original John Carpenter’s Halloween.<br/>In a way, that movie started our careers because the first couple of movies<br/>we made at the ages of 11 and 12 were our own versions of Halloween. We<br/>filmed them in the backyard, the basement, wherever we could, but they<br/>definitely were not very good.<br/><br/>As the years went on, we began making our own original horror films. Fast<br/>forwarding to today, we have worked on and produced multiple movies including<br/>distributed works such as “We are Still Here” and “Book of Evil”. We now<br/>own a production company that has been very successful in Rochester, New<br/>York.</p>
<p>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1583996615/jawqqqtes9qafk1hkfeg.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The reason we decided to start crowdfunding for part 3 is because of how<br/>well ""Halloween Inferno"" was received by the fans. We wanted to make a Part<br/>2 that was even better than the first one to bring the fans of Halloween<br/>(much like ourselves) what they want. Parts 1 and 2 were financed out of<br/>our own pockets and as much as we would love to make a Part 3, production<br/>costs are very expensive and to do it right we need *your help*.<br/><br/>Our goal is to raise enough to cover the basic costs of making a film the<br/>fans want to see. It has always been our dream to work on a Halloween film set<br/>and we want to make something so good that Hollywood will have no choice but<br/>to get us involved in the next one.<br/><br/>See ""Halloween Inferno"" (part 1) here:</p>

<h3>Why Raise Funding?</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise $20,000 to fund this 15-20 minute project. The team<br/>came up with this number after adding up the expenses from the first two<br/>installments that were done out of pocket.<br/><br/>The films were both filmed on industry standard cinema cameras, lenses and<br/>lighting equipment all rented from local production companies. For us to<br/>maintain the quality of the inferno series rentals are a must have.<br/><br/>This money will also go to paying and feeding our extensive cast and<br/>crew for their hard work and dedication. Locations will be a big part of<br/>the budget as we needed to rent multiple locations for several days<br/>for each film. Your contributions will go a long way in pushing production<br/>forward.</p>

<h2>Echo </h2>
<p>Created, and produced by Zenith &amp; Julieth, both of us are fresh to Los Angeles. We both bring an incredible amount of expertise from our respective homelands &amp; cultures. In case you don't know us, Zenith Ander is an Australian actor &amp; writer, and Julieth Restrepo is a Colombian actor.</p>
<p>The beginning of our story introduces you to two women from different backgrounds (and with different accents), who find themselves with more in common than is comfortable. Sound like a crazy idea?! It isn't. We are however breaking moulds long held by Hollywood by taking women from diverse backgrounds and placing them in the same situation. As foreigners in a new land, we want to tell our unique perspectives through a common eye. We've all been in love, and we've all been hurt. Echo is a story that showcases two compelling, genuine and capable female characters experiencing life through each others' eyes. Expect laughs &amp; tears and an overwhelming amount of love.</p>
<p>We want you to be a part of their journey. By contributing to this campaign, you are helping set a precedent for future filmmakers from all over the world. Together we can encourage bravery and boldness in storytellers everywhere!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal is $12,500. Every penny goes to paying our entire cast and crew fairly, keeping them safe, feeding and transporting them. Location costs, insurance costs, equipment costs - Filmmaking is EXPENSIVE. Rest assured that every cent contributed to Echo goes toward creating a safe, fair and fun environment for all involved, with the result of a cool show for you to binge watch at the end! (This largely comes down to our editor. Help us hire one!)</p>
<p>Don't forget to check out the perks you will receive for your contribution! Each amount gets you something cool and different. We are so excited to have you be a part of our campaign that we want you to have a memento - Receive a signed script, signed photo or even a one-on-one Spanish or English class!</p>
<p>While we really REALLY hope to hit our target before the end of this campaign, we will make Echo regardless. Our crew may be fed only tomatoes and basil that grows on Zenith's deck for the entire weeks shoot. Some may have to hitch a ride to DTLA in the back of a UPS truck hauling lighting gear. Many will dehydrate in Los Angeles' perpetual desert heat... The truth is that we desperately don't want to subject our precious people to anything less than a safe and fair set! You &amp; your contribution really does mean the world to us and to everyone involved!</p>

<h3>What is 'CHARACTERISTICALLY'? </h3>
<p><i>Characteristically</i> is a non-narrative web series (written by Dominique Salerno) that showcases the hilarious and  humiliating  realities of life as a character actor. What is a ""character actor"" you may ask?  In the broadest terms: we are the misfits of the entertainment industry. We are the Sassy Best Friends, the Jovial Shopkeepers, and the Bridge Troll #4s. We are the unsung heroes buried deep within the lead's narrative. In classic tragedies, we usually die early. But now, in this web-series, it's <u>our</u> time to shine!!  Each episode features a character actor struggling to survive.  <i>Characteristically</i>'s ridiculous vignettes are packed with humor and humanity, and these short scenes flesh out the often overlooked world of the quirky supporting actors. </p>
<h3><b>Why should I support 'CHARACTERISTICALLY'?</b></h3>

</div></div>","What is 'CHARACTERISTICALLY'? 
Characteristically is a non-narrative web series (written by Dominique Salerno) that showcases the hilarious and  humiliating  realities of life as a character actor. What is a ""character actor"" you may ask?  In the broadest terms: we are the misfits of the entertainment industry. We are the Sassy Best Friends, the Jovial Shopkeepers, and the Bridge Troll #4s. We are the unsung heroes buried deep within the lead's narrative. In classic tragedies, we usually die early. But now, in this web-series, it's our time to shine!!  Each episode features a character actor struggling to survive.  Characteristically's ridiculous vignettes are packed with humor and humanity, and these short scenes flesh out the often overlooked world of the quirky supporting actors. 
Why should I support 'CHARACTERISTICALLY'?

<h3>On Keith (Season 2 Docuseries)</h3>
<p>Season 1 of the On Keith docuseries was hugely successful with the release of 8 inspiring interviews.  Season 2 is just waiting to be launched but needs funds to complete the editing. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Theresa Robbins Dudeck, PhD</strong>, and Alicia Robbins, are the co-creators and producers behind the docuseries.  Theresa has taught improvisation and applied improvisation all over the world. She is a Fulbright Scholar and considered one of the foremost teachers of Keith Johnstone's Impro System. Theresa wrote the critically acclaimed Keith Johnstone: A Critical Biography (Bloomsbury 2013), serves as Johnstone’s Literary Executor, and is co-editor of two books on applied improvisation: Applied Improvisation: Leading, Collaborating, and Creating Beyond the Theatre (2018) and The Applied Improvisation Mindset (forthcoming 2021).  Her sister, <strong>Alicia Robbins</strong>, holds the record for being the first female cinematographer to shoot a Shondaland series.  Robbins was the lead DP on Grey’s Anatomy season 17, after also having shot season 16.  Her next venture will be one of the alternating DPs for a new Netflix series (still undisclosed).  She has been working as a cinematographer in Los Angeles for the past 17 years and filmed most of the content for the On Keith docuseries.  Theresa and Alicia also partnered with <strong>Dan O'Connor</strong> as a Co-Producer.  Dan was the Artistic Director and Co-Founder of the critically acclaimed LA based Impro Theatre. He is also a co-founder of BATS Improv in San Francisco. He directed the critically acclaimed hybrid sit-coms Sons and Daughters for ABC, and Campus Ladies for the Oxygen Network. He was a writer and the improv director for The Wayne Brady Show on ABC and co-created the improv comedy television show World Cup Comedy for NBC/PAX.  </li>
<li>There are many more interviews that are just waiting to be released!  The editing process can take time and money and funds are needed to release a Season 2.  </li>
<li>Some of the interviews and clips you can look forward to in Season 2 are interviews by Joel McHale, Jack Shepherd, Randy Dixon, Dan O'Connor, Derek Flores, Mariana Muniz and the Theatre Machine reunion with many of its original members at the Royal Court Theatre!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here is what we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>$5000 will help us get the 8 interviews we have already shot edited (Approximately 200 hours of work).  Also, we may be able to shoot one more interview for the season!  The funds will help us pay for minimal crew and equipment for the interview. </li>
<li>Anyone who donates $500 or more will get a co-producer credit! $100 to $499 will be part of the Special Thanks in the credits. </li>
<li>If we don't raiser our entire $5000, we will still launch as many interviews we can that are within the means of the funds that were raised.  </li>

<h3>What is Into You?</h3>
<p>Into You is a dramedy (Drama-Comedy) that follows our main character, Maya Russell, after a reality-shattering breakup. In order to defer her grief and jumpstart her dreams of becoming an idealized version of herself Maya resolves to complete a list of rather humorous tasks.</p>

<h3>Hello World,</h3>
<p>My name is Suzie Hicks. I'm a senior at Emerson College looking to make science fun and accessible for students of a school that doesn't offer it as a major. I grew up watching Bill Nye, and rapidly developed a love for the mind-blowing truth of science. Over the last year, as the climate has (wait for it) CHANGED and our administration has moved towards less scientific education for the public, I began to think of ways to make the important facts fun and relatable so that younger demographics can feel empowered to make a change. And thus emerged Suzie Hicks the Science Chick! SHSC is a feminist TV show laughing at the livelihood of college students (parties, dating, family, and careers) while giving helpful alternatives to potentially unsustainable practices.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>To make SHSC happen, we will be traveling to places like the New England Aquarium, the Museum of Science and multiple farms across Massachusetts to get footage, and will be doing segments about parties and social life on campus. </p>
<p>We are looking for funding to cover the cost of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Props</li>
<li>Costumes</li>
<li>Transportation</li>
<li>Publicity</li>
</ul>
<p>All proceeds left over from production will be donated to Mass Audobon, a local environmental non-profit encouraging the love of nature in young people.</p>
<p>If you are unable to donate, don't worry! All we ask is that you share our message, share this campaign or just watch the final product when it comes out. Your support in any capacity means a whole lot.</p>
