<p><i>17<sup>th</sup>  Seoul Marginal Theatre Festival 2015</i></p>
<p><b>""Fifteen W</b><b>ŏ</b><b>n Fifty </b><b>Ch</b><b>ŏ</b><b>n</b><b>”</b></p>
<p><i>21 July – 2 August 2015</i></p>
<div>
<p>This year's festival takes as its theme questions of exclusion that in recent times seem to have gained a certain velocity in South Korean society. Discrimination and marginalisation towards minorities; the isolation of workers within the capitalist system; over-commercialised universities; histories of confinement; border controls and other matters concerning the ""other"" as different to a supposed ""we"". </p>
<p>The expression ""Fifteen Wŏn Fifty Chŏn” comes from the period following the 1923 Great Kanto Earthquake in Japan and the massacre of Korean (""Chosŏn"") people accused of inciting rebellion against the imperial Japanese government in the wake of the earthquake's devastation across the Tokyo region. Not just Korean people, but also other minorities, particularly the Chinese Wenzho, those from Okinawa, the Rkukyu and Amami islands, and other people residing in Tokyo from other regions across Japan (particularly those from the Tohoku area) were also killed, imprisoned or tortured on being identified as ""other"" through their ""Korean"" pronunciation of this simple phrase: ""Fifteen Wŏn Fifty Chŏn"". </p>
<p>And so can be seen too how in contemporary Korean society are also divisions, distinctions, marginalisations and targets to provide scapegoats as a tool of domination. Are we not then also in the process of becoming a society all too willing to eradicate all possible thought of a shared human dignity?</p>
<p>With this year's Seoul Marginal Theatre Festival, through a communal space known as ""theatre"" within the ""stage"" of life, moving with our ""entire body""* across the borders of ""here"" or ""there"", recognising the respectful values of the many marginalised and oppressed, meeting with companionship and hospitable debate, we seek a recovery of feelings lost and offer the potential for a new communal solidarity. </p>

<p><i>“Human Lost” is a picture exhibition by one of the survivors of the Busan Brothers Bokjiwon Incident which was a major human violation issue that came to light after March 22 1987 when one person was killed and 35 escaped from the largest vocational rehabilitation facility in Korea, housing many young children and teenagers. As one of the “bokjiwon brothers” from 1984-1987, Han Jongsun through pictures, protests and other art works, including in 2012 a one person protest in front of the Korean government, has given witness to the violations that were perpetuated at the complex. As a group these men have continued to develop an active presence to speak their own “truth to power” and recover a sense of human dignity in Korean society. </i></p>

<p><i>“Face Reality 2” is another version of ”Face Reality”, which participated in 'The 1st Human Right Drama Festival 2014'. Both are pure creations where the whole process of writing, directing, acting, organizing is done by members of Giant Girls. Compared to first version which was was a more conventional fiction drama, this second version is a 'free-for-all discussion drama'. Such a change of form follows an aspiration to share the topic of the drama between audience and actors.  Therefore, ”Face Reality 2” will be an artistic space and also a discursive field that unravels the topic of 'Sexworkers' Rights' which in Korea has never been addressed properly.</i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>The performance begins with the story of the prospective writer Yongja Na who publishes her autobiographical novel 'Face Reality',  based on her own experience as a sex-worker. Yongja Na suggests a special event to the audience in the 'Writer’s Talk', which is held to commemorate the publication. She suggests to the audience to have a discussion with her and the ""thinking spirits"" who appear in her dream and argue with her every night.</i></p>

<p><i>Last winter, I landed in Berlin. I was selected as the P.s Berlin Residency artist. It is a programme of Can Foundation Seoul and I was the first and only artist it sent. However there was no support for the cost of living. It was a hard time because I didn’t have money. So ironically I had to work while I was being sent to make art work. </i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>I can`t work in Germany because I`m not supposed to (it is illegal), so I had to work in Seoul. Mainly it was writing and translation. And I also found another small business. It is bottle picking. Unlike in Seoul, Berlin has a funny system called 're-fund'. When you return an empty beer bottle, they give you back 8 cents for each bottle. Germans in general are beer lovers so it is a kind of easy job. So every daytime I went to exhibition and on the way home I picked up empty bottles. And in the night I write and think. So basically what I did in the last 4 months was live and think. </i></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>But I’m an artist so I have to think about art. I have to create something. Just living and thinking can not be creation. So I thought about how I can create art in the situation where I belong. I have thought and thought, thinking day and night. I thought a lot. And finally I came to a sort of conclusion that I can create art where I am now. It is a 'Living and Thinking' combination. I mean, 'Living and Thinking', not 'living' and 'thinking'. Just 'living' is 'living' and 'Thinking' is 'Thinking' but with 'Living And Thinking' combined, there are tiny possibilities that this could be a creation. A creation in the context of contemporary art.</i></p>
<p>Support / Production:<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">.</span></p>
<p>In 1999 when the Seoul Marginal Theatre Festival started with the motto of “Free creative and experimental minds”, through its dedication to become an ""experimental theatre festival"", an ensuing experimentalism developed in relation to new theatre language and forms.  </p>
<p>Through the mid to late 2000s, the institution of the theatre venue was joined with explorations into different kinds of space, including street theatre performances and public art projects. The topic of ""city and theatre"" was explored through the work of many artists and groups. The gaze of the ""marginalised"" was foregrounded in the voices of those subjects historically oppressed and marginalised, such as discharged workers and labourers. The festival attempted to exchange ideas about the contemporary and political possibility of, to echo the eponymous novel of Choi In-Hoon, the ""square"" of theatre. And so over 16 years the festival has continued to evolve as a project to discover the face, voice, discourse, new potentials and strength of imagination to be found in considering the possibilities that might be found within the phrase ""art and society"". </p>
<p>The festival has continued to exist through the support and policies of publicly funded art programmes.  For the 17th Seoul Marginal Theatre Festival however, due to changes in government and the conditions under which public policy continues to operate, it was not possible to ensure that the festival would be able to uphold its position of ""support is fine, but no interference"".</p>
<p>This is not a new phenomenon. In 1973, the Korean Literature Promotion Fund had diminished funds and works that could no longer be supported, or rather, which did not appeal to the central government became, in effect, directly censored. The process of art works lining up for the process of public funding was losing its autonomy. What was defined as a ""public"" arts funding body quickly revealed itself as a politicised ""non-public"" institution. Art is political, but art funders too need to become ""depoliticised"". Only then can art itself naturally grow to be diversely imagined, to consider and communicate the various unseen dimensions of the world. </p>
<p>Based on this philosophy, in order to secure more independent support and artistic autonomy, the 17th Seoul Marginal Theatre Festival is relieving itself of government support and is making efforts to produce its programme through community support and fund-raising. The act of not receiving government funding is predicted to bring difficulties even for the most basic support of artistic activities. But it is not just a proposal for artistic autonomy - it is also a proposal for beginning a new method of festival, where the artists, supporters and spectators are together and can more actively seek out and be responsible for the subjects that make a contemporary festival. </p>
<p>Through crowd-funding and invited donations, the 17th Seoul Marginal Theatre Festival welcomes the participation of supporters wishing for meaningful artistic experiment. <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></p>

Compared to first version which was was a more conventional fiction drama, this second version is a 'free-for-all discussion drama'. Such a change of form follows an aspiration to share the topic of the drama between audience and actors.  Therefore, ”Face Reality 2” will be an artistic space and also a discursive field that unravels the topic of 'Sexworkers' Rights' which in Korea has never been addressed properly.


The performance begins with the story of the prospective writer Yongja Na who publishes her autobiographical novel 'Face Reality',  based on her own experience as a sex-worker. Yongja Na suggests a special event to the audience in the 'Writer’s Talk', which is held to commemorate the publication. She suggests to the audience to have a discussion with her and the ""thinking spirits"" who appear in her dream and argue with her every night.
Slipping Away - Living Queer Reader's Theatre


An adaptation of the story “Slipping Away” by Jacqueline Woodson, first published in the groundbreaking U.S. collection of queer stories for young people, “Am I Blue” published in the 1990s. “Slipping Away” portrays the complexities and reactions experienced by young people confused about their sexual identity, including the perspecive of their parents; a story that gradually opens the eyes of understanding and sympathy. 


Special Lecture ""This is University"" - Eunyoung Kwon X Freecamp




A performance that questions “what is the university system?” so over-run by the pressures of entrance examinations and restructuring. How much should we, could we, be in control of it, and what would it Iook like if it could be changed?
""70 Years Old"" - Community Theatre of Seoulkedam X Bukjeong Maeul


What does it mean to reach the age of 70 in contemporary Korean society, a society so driven by capitalist growth, and structured on western-centric imperialism? What are the possibilities then for friendship and the memory of community once one reaches such an age? How can the strains of our time be replaced by a greater care for our environment and ecological values? This performance tells a story of group of older people who grew up post-1945 and live in Seoul’s Bukjeong neighbourhood. 



""Living And Thinking As Artist Practice""  - Byungseo Yoo




Last winter, I landed in Berlin. I was selected as the P.s Berlin Residency artist. It is a programme of Can Foundation Seoul and I was the first and only artist it sent. However there was no support for the cost of living. It was a hard time because I didn’t have money. So ironically I had to work while I was being sent to make art work. 


I can`t work in Germany because I`m not supposed to (it is illegal), so I had to work in Seoul. Mainly it was writing and translation. And I also found another small business. It is bottle picking. Unlike in Seoul, Berlin has a funny system called 're-fund'. When you return an empty beer bottle, they give you back 8 cents for each bottle. Germans in general are beer lovers so it is a kind of easy job. So every daytime I went to exhibition and on the way home I picked up empty bottles. And in the night I write and think. So basically what I did in the last 4 months was live and think. 


But I’m an artist so I have to think about art. I have to create something. Just living and thinking can not be creation. So I thought about how I can create art in the situation where I belong. I have thought and thought, thinking day and night. I thought a lot. And finally I came to a sort of conclusion that I can create art where I am now. It is a 'Living and Thinking' combination. I mean, 'Living and Thinking', not 'living' and 'thinking'. Just 'living' is 'living' and 'Thinking' is 'Thinking' but with 'Living And Thinking' combined, there are tiny possibilities that this could be a creation. A creation in the context of contemporary art.
Support / Production:.
In 1999 when the Seoul Marginal Theatre Festival started with the motto of “Free creative and experimental minds”, through its dedication to become an ""experimental theatre festival"", an ensuing experimentalism developed in relation to new theatre language and forms.  
Through the mid to late 2000s, the institution of the theatre venue was joined with explorations into different kinds of space, including street theatre performances and public art projects. The topic of ""city and theatre"" was explored through the work of many artists and groups. The gaze of the ""marginalised"" was foregrounded in the voices of those subjects historically oppressed and marginalised, such as discharged workers and labourers. The festival attempted to exchange ideas about the contemporary and political possibility of, to echo the eponymous novel of Choi In-Hoon, the ""square"" of theatre. And so over 16 years the festival has continued to evolve as a project to discover the face, voice, discourse, new potentials and strength of imagination to be found in considering the possibilities that might be found within the phrase ""art and society"". 
The festival has continued to exist through the support and policies of publicly funded art programmes.  For the 17th Seoul Marginal Theatre Festival however, due to changes in government and the conditions under which public policy continues to operate, it was not possible to ensure that the festival would be able to uphold its position of ""support is fine, but no interference"".
This is not a new phenomenon. In 1973, the Korean Literature Promotion Fund had diminished funds and works that could no longer be supported, or rather, which did not appeal to the central government became, in effect, directly censored. The process of art works lining up for the process of public funding was losing its autonomy. What was defined as a ""public"" arts funding body quickly revealed itself as a politicised ""non-public"" institution. Art is political, but art funders too need to become ""depoliticised"". Only then can art itself naturally grow to be diversely imagined, to consider and communicate the various unseen dimensions of the world. 
Based on this philosophy, in order to secure more independent support and artistic autonomy, the 17th Seoul Marginal Theatre Festival is relieving itself of government support and is making efforts to produce its programme through community support and fund-raising. The act of not receiving government funding is predicted to bring difficulties even for the most basic support of artistic activities. But it is not just a proposal for artistic autonomy - it is also a proposal for beginning a new method of festival, where the artists, supporters and spectators are together and can more actively seek out and be responsible for the subjects that make a contemporary festival. 
Through crowd-funding and invited donations, the 17th Seoul Marginal Theatre Festival welcomes the participation of supporters wishing for meaningful artistic experiment.

<p>America, and the Adventures of Nat Turn-Up!<br/></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>Nat Turn-Up, is an 18 year old rapper from Brooklyn, New York. After a taste of the
 ills of America's justice system, via the lens of a short stay in a 
juvenile detention center, he returns home to his community of family 
and friends on a mission. He is determined to become a 
revolutionary. To uplift and resurrect the minds of his people. Nat, 
along with his community are all fighting for their right to be heard, 
to be seen, to discover who they are and thrive in a world that both at 
times covertly and overtly oppresses them from being able to bask in the
 freedom which they all seek. As Gil Scott Heron once so poignantly said
 ""Who Will Survive in America?"" The characters in this play all ask this
 same question. What will it take to truly be free? Is it possible, and 
for who?<br/>

</h3>
<ul>
<li>""America, and The Adventures of Nat Turn-Up!"" is in the early stages of it's development. In the past I've jumped right into production mode but this time I want to take the time to really flesh this piece out because I believe it to be both powerful and special. It's extremely personal to me. Therefore, my goal is to produce a week and a half long developmental workshop that will culminate in 2-3 performances of the play being presented as a staged reading at The Faison Firehouse Theatre in Harlem, N.Y. this summer.<br/>
</li>
<li>Everything we raise will be going right into making this Staged Reading/Developmental workshop a success.</li>
<li>Your very generous donations will contribute to things such as allowing us to secure a rehearsal space, acquire rehearsal materials, provide transportation funds &amp; compensation for an extremely gifted and dope creative team, among other costs that may arise in the process of putting this project on it's feet. <br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>I was born and raised in Brooklyn, N.Y. The same borough that this play takes place in. It is really important to me to see my community reflected not only in the media, but on stage. I've always been very inspired by what August Wilson did in depicting the lives and stories of African American people in Pittsburgh, PA in his ten play cycle which spanned over the course of the twentieth century. My goal is to do something similar for Brooklyn. This play is to be the first part of a much longer cycle, giving voice to people and a community that often goes misrepresented and unheard. I too want to leave a legacy that honors those from which I come from and also delves into the complexities of our existence. I want my people to feel seen. I think that it's important for art to speak. To bring about social and 
revolutionary change. I want this play to inspire people to mobilize. To
 awaken and unite. I want my community to rise above the system that attempts to silence them, heal and feel empowered to reclaim the glory and royalty that has always been running through our veins. For any of these things to happen, it is essential that this developmental process has all of the tools that it needs. This is where you come in. : ) I really hope that you will consider donating to this project today.<br/>

""Comida de Puta
(F%&king Lousy Food)"" by Bronx native Desi
Moreno-Penson, winner of MultiStages 2013 New Works Contest. Congratulations, Desi! This year's production season is dedicated to supporting Latina women of Puerto Rican heritage. BRAVA!  Last Fall we produced the award-winning new musical Temple of the Souls set in Puerto Rico's El Yunque rain forest, and now we're moving Uptown to the Bronx.
Supporting new works by women of color is critically needed. The statistics of Latina playwrights getting their work produced in the United States is extremely low, and a great shame for all of us. We are missing these voices, perspectives, stories ... And it's time to LISTEN.
Please join us in our mission to support, encourage, and bring this amazing world premiere to the stage. We need you to make it happen!COMIDA DE  PUTA (F%&king Lousy Food) by Desi Moreno-Penson directed by Lorca PeressApril 8-26, 2015 West End Theatre at The Church of St. Paul & St. Andrew 263 West 86th St. New
York, NY 
AEA Showcase
Sex, magic, and  spoken-word poetry illuminate this dark erotic tale of Phaedra on the gritty  streets of the Bronx. A bodega owner’s new wife becomes strangely obsessed with  her husband’s son, the lunch counter boy. Driven by lust, she invokes the  vengeful power of the Santeria Gods who set off a vicious chain of events that  no one can stop. This multidisciplinary piece features a Cast of 6 onstage and 6 onscreen, an onstage musician, and 4 Videos shot on location. Your donation will help us reach both our artistic and financial goals. This multimedia piece requires a large technical staff and sophisticated technical equipment.

<h3></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Designed by Newell Taylor Reynolds for himself and his wife and partner, Bella Lewitzky, the PostHouse is a one-of-a-kind place for dance in Los Angeles. Formerly home to the Lewitzky Dance Company for twenty years, <i>the PostHouse now is at a critical crossroads.</i> In order to preserve this space as a resource for the Los Angeles dance community, we need to raise some funds to acquire majority equity in the property and keep it going.</p>
<p>Since 1997, we have offered rehearsal space, classes and workshops, with a diverse range of companies and individuals actively working in the dance field. During that time, more than thirty companies and many more individual choreographers have created dances and art here in the beautiful environment that Newell built, and that he and Bella maintained. </p>

<h4>A little about the history of the space:</h4>
<p></p>
<p>Bella Lewitzky was a protege and then a colleague of Lester Horton, forming the Horton Dance Group in the 1930s, a company which continued until the early 1950s. Horton was a multi-talented artist who realized his vision through the purity of expression in dance and developed, with Bella, the Horton technique, still taught widely around the world. Bella’s company, The Lewitzky Dance Company under Bella's artistic direction, along with executive directors Darlene Neel and Ruth Eliel, performed and taught nationally and internationally. Her work in the Artists in the Schools program and on many panels and committees to promote the teaching of art in the United States was highly influential and formed a generation of dance educators throughout the States.</p>
<p>Of the Horton Dance Group notable artists include Alvin Ailey, Carmen DeLavallade, James Truitt and fashion designer Rudi Guernrich. Newell was briefly associated with the HDG as a dancer and went on to design sets for dance as an adjunct to his career as an architect. The next generation of dancemakers who Bella trained have influenced dance students by their work in performance and education - June Morris, Fred Strickler, Gary Bates, Jan Day, Linda Davis, Kurt Weinheimer,  MaryAnn Kellogg, Iris Pell, Sean Greene, Loretta Livingston, Susan Rose, Amy Ernst, Walter Kennedy, Laura McKirihan <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Poole, John Pennington, Christopher Burnside, Nora Reynolds Daniel, Don Bondi and Charles Edmondson, among others</span></p>
<h4>Comments from artists who have worked here:</h4>
<div>
<p>I had the singular privilege of working as
a musician and musical collaborator with Bella Lewitzky and her company for
many years - and the PostHouse was a second home to me at times. I went on to
compose scores for many of Bella's alumni and much of it was created at the
space. The space was built by Bella and her architect husband to be exactly
what it is - a shrine for dancers and choreographers in Los Angeles.<br/>
<br/>
The history of dance in Los Angeles has in many ways centered around activities
at PostHouse - classes, master classes, workshops, choreography space,
rehearsals, video and photo shoots and numerous receptions for visiting
luminaries.<br/>
<br/>
Dancer/choreographer/educator Diana MacNeil has carried on the tradition of the
PostHouse as a creative place for the LA dance community - charging insanely
low fees for the use of the space for classes and rehearsals. <br/>
<br/>
The PostHouse needs our help to keep it alive. I will be making a donation and
I hope everyone with a love of dance will do so. We can't let this
one-of-a-kind legacy disappear - there is nothing else like it here for the
current generation of dancers and the next to come.<br/>
<b>Jeff Rona</b></p>
<p>Viver Brasil had a few very incredible experiences at the
Post House in our early years working with world renowned Brazilian teacher,
dancer, choreographer Rosangela Silvestre.  The space was inspiring and
the rent completely affordable. We had to move on as the neighbors did not love
our drums as much as we need. Nevertheless, Diana has fervently maintained the
space for all to use. This beautiful studio must survive! Give! </p>
<p><b>Linda

<p>I have so many fond memories of creating
works in this enchanted ground so conducive to the process.
""Cornfield,"" ""The Colorado,"" ""Dark Corner,""
""Miniatures,"" ""Sing to Me of Love,"" ""Primal

<p>For years The PostHouse was a second home
for me. It was in that space that I grew into an adult dancer and became
initiated in Lewitzky technique, thanks to <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/diana.macneil"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Diana</span></a>.
I found a wonderful dance community coming to class and rehearsals at The

<p>Thank you for having this wonderful space
available for the Dance Community of Los Angeles. I for one have spent many
years dancing in this space and learning how to dance in the style of Bella.
This has been an indescribable gift for me, and it has made my life in Los

</div></div>","Save the PostHouse for Los Angeles Dance!


Designed by Newell Taylor Reynolds for himself and his wife and partner, Bella Lewitzky, the PostHouse is a one-of-a-kind place for dance in Los Angeles. Formerly home to the Lewitzky Dance Company for twenty years, the PostHouse now is at a critical crossroads. In order to preserve this space as a resource for the Los Angeles dance community, we need to raise some funds to acquire majority equity in the property and keep it going.
Since 1997, we have offered rehearsal space, classes and workshops, with a diverse range of companies and individuals actively working in the dance field. During that time, more than thirty companies and many more individual choreographers have created dances and art here in the beautiful environment that Newell built, and that he and Bella maintained. 
The PostHouse today is a continuation of this commitment to dance as a living, relevant art form that speaks to and from the heart and spirit.

If we are forced to sell the result would most likely be a ""tear-down"" and the loss forever of this historic home and studio.




Those of us who want to lift up the talented dancers and dance-makers here in Los Angeles can come together and keep this resource alive.


                                                              


We have maintained this iconic building for 18 years without asking for any outside help and want to continue the work here without interruption and without dependence on outside influences. It is unfortunate that circumstances now compel us to seek your help. Please be assured that this is a one-time, not an ongoing, appeal.
How can you help?
The target amount is $160,000; of that we already have raised one quarter, leaving an approximate need of $120,000, which includes costs to run the campaign. You can donate through Indiegogo. Any amount is needed and welcome.
Please tell your friends and colleagues about the campaign!!
This campaign opens a broad public appeal - both to dancers and artists who have created here as well as to all people who are interested in preserving this unique and historic place for dance in Los Angeles. The studio has fed many artists and birthed many works of art - it has the capacity to do so for many years into the future. 

Thank you for your time reading this and please help if you can- the life dreams of many people are in your hands - and their feet! You can be a part of fulfilling those dreams with your generous contribution. Any donation will help us to meet the goal! With much appreciation and gratitude, we thank you!
Please send this message to your friends and colleagues - the more who see the need for support the more we can continue to DANCE ON!

A little about the history of the space:

Bella Lewitzky was a protege and then a colleague of Lester Horton, forming the Horton Dance Group in the 1930s, a company which continued until the early 1950s. Horton was a multi-talented artist who realized his vision through the purity of expression in dance and developed, with Bella, the Horton technique, still taught widely around the world. Bella’s company, The Lewitzky Dance Company under Bella's artistic direction, along with executive directors Darlene Neel and Ruth Eliel, performed and taught nationally and internationally. Her work in the Artists in the Schools program and on many panels and committees to promote the teaching of art in the United States was highly influential and formed a generation of dance educators throughout the States.
Of the Horton Dance Group notable artists include Alvin Ailey, Carmen DeLavallade, James Truitt and fashion designer Rudi Guernrich. Newell was briefly associated with the HDG as a dancer and went on to design sets for dance as an adjunct to his career as an architect. The next generation of dancemakers who Bella trained have influenced dance students by their work in performance and education - June Morris, Fred Strickler, Gary Bates, Jan Day, Linda Davis, Kurt Weinheimer,  MaryAnn Kellogg, Iris Pell, Sean Greene, Loretta Livingston, Susan Rose, Amy Ernst, Walter Kennedy, Laura McKirihan Poole, John Pennington, Christopher Burnside, Nora Reynolds Daniel, Don Bondi and Charles Edmondson, among others
Comments from artists who have worked here:

I had the singular privilege of working as
a musician and musical collaborator with Bella Lewitzky and her company for
many years - and the PostHouse was a second home to me at times. I went on to
compose scores for many of Bella's alumni and much of it was created at the
space. The space was built by Bella and her architect husband to be exactly
what it is - a shrine for dancers and choreographers in Los Angeles.

The history of dance in Los Angeles has in many ways centered around activities
at PostHouse - classes, master classes, workshops, choreography space,
rehearsals, video and photo shoots and numerous receptions for visiting
luminaries.

Dancer/choreographer/educator Diana MacNeil has carried on the tradition of the
PostHouse as a creative place for the LA dance community - charging insanely
low fees for the use of the space for classes and rehearsals. 

The PostHouse needs our help to keep it alive. I will be making a donation and
I hope everyone with a love of dance will do so. We can't let this
one-of-a-kind legacy disappear - there is nothing else like it here for the
current generation of dancers and the next to come.

Viver Brasil had a few very incredible experiences at the
Post House in our early years working with world renowned Brazilian teacher,
dancer, choreographer Rosangela Silvestre.  The space was inspiring and
the rent completely affordable. We had to move on as the neighbors did not love
our drums as much as we need. Nevertheless, Diana has fervently maintained the
space for all to use. This beautiful studio must survive! Give! 
Linda
Yudin/Artistic Director Viver Brasil
I have so many fond memories of creating
works in this enchanted ground so conducive to the process.
""Cornfield,"" ""The Colorado,"" ""Dark Corner,""
""Miniatures,"" ""Sing to Me of Love,"" ""Primal
Ground,"" ""Ave Verum Corpus,"" and a host of others made their
entrance in this special space. May it continue to host many, many creators of
dance in days to come.

For years The PostHouse was a second home
for me. It was in that space that I grew into an adult dancer and became
initiated in Lewitzky technique, thanks to Diana.
I found a wonderful dance community coming to class and rehearsals at The
PostHouse and will always treasure my time there

Thank you for having this wonderful space
available for the Dance Community of Los Angeles. I for one have spent many
years dancing in this space and learning how to dance in the style of Bella.
This has been an indescribable gift for me, and it has made my life in Los
Angeles so much richer. Performing modern dance whether in a class or as part
of a performance has allowed me to feel even in a small way, a part of the
Dance Community and I am so grateful that you have made this possible.

<p>We're aiming to raise £6500, which we know is a lot of money but this will give us the funding to take the show to The Etcetera Theatre in October, as well as festivals in 2017 that we're currently negotiating. We're particularly interested in taking it to international audiences in Canada and the U.S. This is ultimate direction we'd like the show to go in, however we're focusing on making the production at The Etcetera Theatre the best that it can be in order to start 2017 in a strong position. 
</p>
<p>Below is a list of things that your contributions will be funding:</p>
<ol>
<li>Theatre Hire - Including technician, use of music, projector etc</li>
<li>Set, Costume and Props -<strong> </strong>The play is set in 1934 in an unnamed Southern American state, and so we have to create an authentic environment that reflects this. This includes a wooden barn, glass bottles, temporary tattoos, food, and more. We also have to hire prop guns, which are costly. </li>
<li>Director Fees and Rehearsal Space </li>
<li>Transport - This includes transport around London during the rehearsal period/production period. It also includes transportation of the set which will require van hire.</li>
<li>Public Liability Insurance </li>
<li>Marketing - This includes photography, printing costs, leaflets etc. </li>
<li>Entrance into festivals in 2017</li>
</ol>
<p><br/></p>

<p><strong>What do you get? Let's talk perks!</strong></p>
<p>We know that we're asking you to be extremely generous, so first and foremost we want to thank you even for visiting this page and showing an interest in us. By contributing you can choose from a range of exciting perks that we've created, including the opportunity to have a drink with Bonnie and Clyde in a speakeasy. (They'll be paying, don't worry...) We've created perks to suit a range of budgets, so you can choose anything from extremely grateful social media shout-outs, to getting exclusive post-show party invitations, or even the chance to become a full executive producer of the show. Check out the full range of perks on the right &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/></p>
<ol>
</ol> <div> </div> <div><strong>Hang on, what happens if we don't reach our target?</strong></div>
<div>If we don't reach 100% of our target (fingers crossed this won't happen), then we'll have to forget any aspirations of taking the show to different festivals and audiences in 2017, as this requires a fair amount of funding. If we only reach 50% of our target we'll still be able to take the show to The Etcetera Theatre, but we won't be able to make the show that we've dreamed of and will have to put everything on an even more extreme budget which will negatively affect the show. We think this would be really unfortunate because the play is set in a wonderfully detailed world, and having the freedom to create that world with the set, props and costumes is something we're committed to providing we have the correct budget.</div>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div> </div>
<p>Your contributions will not only help this production, they <strong>are</strong> this production. The money we aim to raise is to cover every aspect of the plays production, from its very beginning to development in 2017 and beyond. We've chosen to embark on this journey because we feel we can do the play justice and create something truly special.</p>
<p>Even though the play is set in 1934 in America, we've already noticed many similarities between the social climate back then compared to the world we live in now. Bonnie and Clyde were young people that had struggled through the Great Depression, and even though the path they chose in life caused complete devastation to many families, it's important to understand what led them down this route. Since the economic crash in 2008 people all over the world have faced their own hardships, including huge amounts of unemployment and rising costs of living compared to the increase in wages. A study from the American Psychological Association has shown that young people aged between 18 - 33 are more stressed than the rest of the population, by quite a margin. Factors such as paying back student loans and the pressure of buying a house and starting a family contribute towards this stress, for instance in the UK it's now common knowledge that tuition fees have trebled to £9000, creating huge amounts of debt for young people and deterring many from higher education altogether. These themes of isolation and despair are beautifully brought to life in the text, and manage to make a play set 82 years ago resonate with modern audiences.</p>
<p>We feel extremely privaledged  to have Alexandra Spencer - Jones on board as she's well established within the arts industry and has had a wealth of experience in producing and directing theatre. Her theatre company <em>Action To The Word</em> currently has taken up residence at the Broadway Theatre in Catford, which will really help as this gives us flexible rehearsal space. Alexandra has worked with Tom in the past by casting him as Hamlet, and also as Harry Bagley in <em>Cloud 9</em> by Caryl Churchill. By working with her again we know that the show is in safe hands.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<div> </div>
<p>Our main obstacle will be making sure we market the show properly so that we hopefully sell out every night. Seeing as its only playing for one week we want to make sure that we're playing to full houses as often as possible, as this will also generate buzz for any future performances we do in 2017 etc. Another challenge is simply the logistics of moving the set, costumes, props across London and then storing them when they're not in use. Raising enough funds would eliminate this problem as we could afford to hire the required vehicles and storage facilities with little difficulty. In terms of taking the show to different venues in 2017, this would require a well planned strategy of applications as well as funding, as some international festivals charge fees to apply. </p>
<div> </div>
<p>Alexandra has a history of creating productions and then taking them to multiple venues, from fringe settings to West End theatres, and so we would draw from her experience in guiding us through these challenges to ensure the show becomes a success.</p>

Time is ticking - they're on the run from the law and from reality, but which one will catch them first?Based on the true story, and set in 1934 in an unnamed southern state of America, Bonnie and Clyde is an intimate re-telling of the final hours of one of the world's most infamous criminal couples.Bonnie and Clyde was written by Adam Peck (Bristol Old Vic Associate Artist) and first produced in 2010 at Theatre 503. The entire play is a two-hander featuring only Bonnie and Clyde whilst they're hiding out in an abandoned barn trying to escape the law, reflecting on their turbulent past and struggling to predict what their future holds. Adam has created such vivid characters that aren't the stereotypical 'Bonnie and Clyde' most people automatically think of, and as actors this really excites us. We also understand that there's a great deal of responsibility when it comes to playing real people, so we've already begun the process of thoroughly researching the two of them. In addition to this we both have to organise the details of the set, costumes, props, budget and marketing - so there's lots of work to be done. It's a huge logistical and financial challenge to produce any form of theatre, especially at this point in time when arts funding has been cut so drastically. By contributing you will literally be the backbone of this production, and will be giving an exceptionally dedicated team of people the opportunity to create challenging theatre that brings an iconic piece of American history to London.Our Company
Libitum Theatre is a new theatre company founded by Tom Nunez (Clyde) in late 2015. Our aim is really simple - when we find a play/project that excites us and we think we can work with, we'll do everything possible to turn it into a full production. Bonnie and Clyde will be a co-production with the award - winning theatre company Action To The Word, and we're lucky to have its founder and artistic director Alexandra Spencer-Jones on board as the director of our production. (Read below for more information)

Tom graduated from the Birmingham School of Acting in 2014, where he played the roles of Stucley in The Castle, Harry Bagley in Cloud 9, and Stone in City Of Angels. He has also played Hamlet for the award- winning theatre company Action To The Word. Other credits include BBC, ITV, and SKY television/commercial productions, as well as featuring as a Slytherin Student in multiple Harry Potter films.









Angel Parker (Bonnie) is our Associate Artist and has recently finished a foundation degree at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art (LAMDA). Whilst training she played the role of Miranda in William Shakespeare's The Tempest, as well as playing Irina Arkadina in Chekov's classic The Seagull. Other stage roles include Jane in The Wonderful World of Dissocia, and Victora in Cloud 9. Angel has been working in the acting industry from a young age, including featuring in both St Trinian's films and also gaining a place with The National Youth Theatre.







Alexandra Spencer - Jones (Director) is the founder and Artistic Director of the award-winning theatre company Action To The Word. She has produced and directed A Clockwork Orange which was met with critical acclaim. It was then taken up by West End producers Glynis Henderson Produtions, and subsequently has toured worldwide.

<h3>About the play...</h3>
<p><i>""Forgive me or kill me. That's the only choice you've got.""</i><br/><br/>New Year’s Eve. 1989. South Africa. A black night watchman is preparing for his shift at a small, shabby travelling amusement park encamped outside a Karoo town. A white former army noncom approaches the park preparing for a night of celebration. As the new decade begins, the two men are forced to confront the future, while struggling to forgive the past. From the internationally acclaimed South African playwright Athol Fugard, <i>Playland </i>is a microcosm of the political and social upheaval of the apartheid system drawn out as two men try to learn what it means to walk side by side.<br/>​<br/><i>""A metaphor set to the sad and sour music of apartheid."" </i> - The New York Post<br/>​<br/><i>""Fugard provides some meaty, at times searing arias for both men.""</i> - The New York Times</p>

<p><strong>Jerry Rudasill (Martinus Zoeloe)</strong> is a longtime Philadelphia based actor having worked with several Theater companies in the region including Azuka, Bootless Artworks, Philadelphia Shakespeare, Iron Age, Curio Theater Company, Hedgerow Theater, Shakespeare in Clark Park, Luna Theater Company, Plays and Players, and the Idiopathic Ridiculopathy Consortium, and was one of the original artists to participate in the inaugural season of the Philadelphia Fringe Festival over twenty years ago. He has served on the Board of the Philadelphia Dramatist Center and taught acting at New Freedom Theater and the Lawrenceville School. Notable credits include Feste in Shakespeare's <i>Twelfth Night</i>, Aaron the Moor in <i>Titus Andronicus</i>, Gerard Escobar in <i>Death and the Maiden</i>, RP McMurphy in <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</i>, and the Soldier in Sarah Kane's, <i>Blasted</i> to mention only a few. Jerry is a graduate of Dickinson College and a 1992 recipient of the Weiss Prize for the Arts. This is his first time returning to the stage in two years and is excited to participate in a production of  one of the works of Athol Fugard, a personal favorite playwright.</p>

<h3>Why this play now?</h3>
<p>In light of this country's current political and social climate, I felt the need to produce a play that is about acceptance, forgiveness, and respect. However, I also thought it was important to show that these three things are incredibly difficult to achieve, both for ourselves and for others. The act of obtaining them takes great sacrifice, self reflection, and sometimes painful honesty.</p>
<p><i>Playland </i>takes place near the end of apartheid in South Africa. It follows a black man and a white man as they attempt to find forgiveness in each other and in themselves. I have learned a lot about what it means to forgive by reading this play, and think it is an important piece that will surely promote active dialogue between audience members.<br/> </p>
<h3>Why support theatre?</h3>
<p>Before choosing to produce any play, I always ask myself why this piece must be seen in the theatre, and not on film or television. For this play, the answer came quickly: This play requires both stillness and risk. Various, quick camera angles would take away from the rawness of the piece. These men completely expose themselves emotionally, with no edits or touch-ups possible. Their breath is heavy, their hesitations filled with decades of fear and rage. This story can be told no other way than live.<br/> </p>

</div></div>","About the play...
""Forgive me or kill me. That's the only choice you've got.""New Year’s Eve. 1989. South Africa. A black night watchman is preparing for his shift at a small, shabby travelling amusement park encamped outside a Karoo town. A white former army noncom approaches the park preparing for a night of celebration. As the new decade begins, the two men are forced to confront the future, while struggling to forgive the past. From the internationally acclaimed South African playwright Athol Fugard, Playland is a microcosm of the political and social upheaval of the apartheid system drawn out as two men try to learn what it means to walk side by side.​""A metaphor set to the sad and sour music of apartheid.""  - The New York Post​""Fugard provides some meaty, at times searing arias for both men."" - The New York Times

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>We are Notapom Productions, a new Hamilton based theatre company looking to bring our vision to the stage in our first production: a contemporary retelling of Shakespeare's Romeo &amp; Juliet. This production will be incredibly of the moment, incorporating speeches and political statements surrounding recent elections in regards to racial tensions and tragedies between Islam and Catholicism, ripped right from the headlines of 2016. We will be paying particular attention to the way American politicians, including Donald Trump, use fear mongering and ""Terrorism"" as a buzzword to promote racism and create violent behaviour between neighbours.</p>
<p>We want to provoke people leaving the theatre to be more aware of how headlines and news biases affect their perceptions of others; we need your help to make this happen. </p>
</div><div>
<p>We are looking to raise $3000 to make this vision a reality. This money is an absolute necessity for renting theatre space, purchasing set materials, construction, costumes, props, lighting tech, and makeup. Reaching this goal will allow us to return  profit from ticket sales to the artists and designers.</p>
<p>Every cent we raise will go directly into this production.</p>
<p>Every dollar helps, but if you are interested we are offering unique perks that you can take advantage of, such as a signed cast photo, a shout-out in our program, and a personalized thank you video from cast members.</p>
<p>We are also planning on another wave of perks in the next few weeks so if you don't see anything you like right now, stay updated for more.</p>
<p>Theatre is not easy. It is a collaborative effort that takes hours of rehearsals and planning to accomplish. Luckily, rehearsals are well under way and the energy and trust everyone feels for each other is palpable. Everyone involved is passionate about sharing our message as we workshop the script and develop characters that are relevant to this adaptation.</p>
<p>If you do not have the means to become a backer at this moment, there are other ways you can help. If this sounds like something you could be invested in, spread the word on social media. Every little bit helps. </p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p><strong>Revolutionary Motion (RevMo)</strong> was founded in 2013 by Ben ""Drex"" Drexler, Caitlin Hauer, and Leslie Elmore as a <strong>creative collaboration with props and dance</strong>. We began recruiting performers and working with them to develop new work that would emphasize choreography and movement expression through prop manipulation while maintaining a highly professional commitment to skill development and creative collaboration.</p>
<p>What we didn't expect was that <strong>it would turn into a family</strong>. While we strongly emphasized expression and professionalism, the atmosphere it created led to deep friendships and incredible relationships.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471884177/l0zgpdynfdxqlsull74z.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We've had great success at performing at Burning Man as well as one-off fire and LED performances in the DMV, but we've long harbored a greater ambition: <strong>mount one of our performances as a dance concert</strong>. Put our work in a theatrical context and let it stand alongside ballet and modern dance concerts as a work of creative artistry.</p>
<p>This year, we created something very special. The piece we've written for Burning Man is unlike the ones we'd written in years past. The storyline, the dynamic, the characters that have come about are unlike any piece we have made before. It’s been a long time goal to put a flow arts production on stage and this is the perfect piece to do it with! It will be the first full length flow arts dance concert in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>Help us show the world what our art is capable of as well as share our art with our friends and our community!</p>
<h3>Our Project</h3>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/J9uYcLuQeIs?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>Our piece has been <strong>inspired by this year's Burning Man theme: DaVinci's Workshop</strong>. We took this as an opportunity to explore the historical significance of the Renaissance and Enlightenment from several different perspectives. </p>
<p>We didn't find any simple answers--mechanization has led us from the roots of industrialization and mass production to the last century's explosion in technology: <strong>landing men on the moon and making the world's information ever more accessible </strong>while simultaneously exposing workers to the horrors of factory labor and the emergence of weapons of ever greater destructive potential. Pushing back the tide of superstition into the age of reason has also led to a <strong>stigma toward traditional remedies and community resource structures</strong>, many of which are only now being rediscovered or implemented.</p>
<p>We believe <strong>the flow arts are uniquely suited to expressing these very complicated issues</strong> because our relationships with the objects around us can be complicated: we form a deep distrust of technology we don't understand while at the same time humanizing objects we have regular contact with, naming our cars or talking to our computers when they don't respond as we expect. Nowhere is the tension between object as extension of human while at the same time completely alien more apparent than in flow arts, where the movement of the props we spin is at once a <strong>marriage of intention</strong> as well as a constant <strong>struggle to produce the patterns and effects we see in our heads</strong>.</p>
<h3>Our Goal &amp; Your Perks</h3>
<p>We've done a great deal of the hard work already by writing the work--we can't wait to share it with you! What we need is help funding the production of the show. We have reserved the <strong>Anacostia Arts Center</strong> in Washington, DC for the evenings of <strong>October 21 and 22</strong> and paid our first deposit on the space, but we cannot complete the necessary funds for this show out of pocket. </p>
<p>Our baseline goal is <strong>$2,000</strong> for this production--this is an absolute bare minimum of the funds necessary to pull this off. This covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Rental of the blackbox theater</strong> at the Anacostia Arts Center.</li>
<li>
<strong>Purchase of black lights</strong> to enhance the experience of our performance--since we are not performing with fire we want to get people as close to that experience as we can muster.</li>
<li>
<strong>Paying a stage manager </strong>and a sound and light technician.</li>
<li>
<strong>Advertising materials</strong>, including postcards, posters, and Facebook ads to get butts in seats--we want people to see this show!</li>
<li>
<strong>Insurance </strong>for the event.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally, we'd like to raise <strong>$3,000</strong>! Here's what that would cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Paying all our performers</strong> for their effort and time!</li>
<li>
<strong>New costuming</strong> specifically designed for this show.</li>

<strong>Professional video recording</strong> of the show to share online--to inspire other artists with our work and make it available to the entire world for free!</li>

Revolution is a competitive show choir group from Olentangy Orange High School in Lewis Center, Ohio.  We have been competing since the High School opened its doors in 2008.  </p>
<p>As a competitive show choir, we travel around the state with a 20-minute production of singing, dancing, theatrics, and musicianship, smiling amid several costume and set changes and trying to win over the judges and the crowds.  The long hours of intense work and pressure, as well our love of music and performance, have together created a close-knit team and family.</p>
<p>Like many schools, our arts program does not get the level of funding it needs, but we still strive to put on the best show possible. Being a new school, we know we are the pioneers of what we believe will become a strong and proud tradition of performance and championships.  This is where you can help.  Please consider helping us in our pursuit of excellence that will keep our school and future students engaged in the arts. <br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are looking to add instruction from professional within the world of show choir to sharpen our abilities as a team as well as improving our set that has inhibited our ability to set up and present effectively.  </p>

</div></div>","Short Summary WE ARE! REVOLUTION!  That is how we introduce ourselves to the world. Revolution is a competitive show choir group from Olentangy Orange High School in Lewis Center, Ohio.  We have been competing since the High School opened its doors in 2008.  
As a competitive show choir, we travel around the state with a 20-minute production of singing, dancing, theatrics, and musicianship, smiling amid several costume and set changes and trying to win over the judges and the crowds.  The long hours of intense work and pressure, as well our love of music and performance, have together created a close-knit team and family.
Like many schools, our arts program does not get the level of funding it needs, but we still strive to put on the best show possible. Being a new school, we know we are the pioneers of what we believe will become a strong and proud tradition of performance and championships.  This is where you can help.  Please consider helping us in our pursuit of excellence that will keep our school and future students engaged in the arts.    What We Need & What You Get We are looking to add instruction from professional within the world of show choir to sharpen our abilities as a team as well as improving our set that has inhibited our ability to set up and present effectively.  
    The Impact In the end, you would be helping a bunch of kids that just want to dance, sing and be accepted for loving this so much.  There are more of us out there that just need an awesome tradition, and some outreach from members of a championship team to light that spark to want to sing and dance in front of the world.  We are fearless when we perform, and it helps us be fearless in our lives.  Help us reach our potential as a team, and encourage more students to embrace the arts and amazing experiences you can have.  
    Risks & Challenges Even with additional resources no one can guarantee a win.  That's why you play the game, right?  But the encouragement you'll provide by believing in us and helping us with our goal will last past a win or lose during competition.  
    Other Ways You Can Help Follow and post anything and everything on every social media account you can.  And if you can't give, but see our posts, send us some good vibes and positive attitudes!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</h3>
<p>In the past 2 years alone, we have staged over 780 performances in 65 theatres to over 250,000 people without a penny of public subsidy.</p>
<p></p>We can see that regional
public arts funding is heading towards a crisis point. Arts
venues are closing in local communities and there are an
increasingly smaller number of touring companies who
can afford to take good quality work on the road.
Audiences are invited to take fewer creative risks with
what they see – and touring theatre is not seen as important,
not vital, not something contemporary and relevant to
talk about with friends.
Yet, touring theatre still has the unique responsibility of
giving Great Britain access to stories and ideas proposed
from different perspectives, places to come and be
challenged, to hear different voices, to share stories with
neighbours and to laugh long and loud.</div><div>Of course, theatre
is still thriving in London and the UK’s big cities – it’s a
great time for story-telling – but is that inspiring if you live
in a small town without ready access to transport or the
inclination to travel for hours.
What was the last thing you saw in your local theatre? If it
didn’t excite you, why not? If it did – great! Now- what
would happen if everyone in your community could keep
having experiences like that week-in, week-out? Good
theatres bring people together. Good stories bring joy
and reflection and memories, and they remind us about
the very great power we have as people alive today with
beating hearts, emotions and passions.</div><div> We have a vision
to bring back great theatre to the regions with heart and
ambition... but we need your help.
We want to take the best writers, actors and artists and
make work that will ignite stages around the country. Not
made for the West End, but made for Hull, made for
Eastbourne for Basingstoke, for Darlington for Berwickupon-Tweed
and hundreds of other beautiful, vibrant UK
towns. No compromises and no live screening in cinemas. </div><div>Communication and collaboration has changed in the last
ten years and we know that our voices and wishes can
count for something.
We are asking now for your voice to join the voices of
thousands of others. We are not asking you to save a single
theatre, or a specific community or group, we are asking
you to stand up for original theatre in every town, for
every community, for everyone. Demand more, engage

churches. I am volunteering to create a self-sustaining, income generating show about 
Lalibela history, community and culture to be 
performed in the fine UNESCO
Cultural Center run by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism in the town of Lalibela. The
 intimate theater houses a stage and seats for 138 people.  The ongoing show will be performed by local adult Circus and Dance 
Association members working full time. Revenue from ticket sales will 
build 
sustainable income
for the Lalibela Circus and Cultural School and the community. Lalibela holds what some call the 8th wonder of the world, ancient 
architecture carved into the earth, instead of built upon it. We are creating business liaisons with 
the tourist industry to support this employment-creating project, while 
contributing to the community's rich ancient 
culture through modern voices.<br/></p><p></p><p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>We need $14,954 to cover
the costs of fixing the sound system and automated movie screen in the 
UNESCO Cultural Center, a new set of mats, three traditional Ethiopian 
instruments, lights, microphones, sound equipment, traditional costumes 
and
a rehearsal fee of $25 a week for 14  performers. We are planning for a 
2-month
rehearsal schedule. This will enable us to create a
professional show that will be performed regularly for the visitors and 
tourists who come to see the remarkable churches. They will be 
transformed through an experience which exposes them to the 
cultural life, beauty and challenges of the community. <br/></p><p>Here is the budget breakdown.</p><p></p><p>                                             <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449885447/pbxoqdjvqkuuywvdzihn.png"" src="""" style=""width: 280.946px; height: 189px;""/></p>Mats - $1930, Musical Instruments - $1684, Costumes - $1050, Lights - $1476, Sound equipment - $2467, Set - $1500, Cultural Space Work - $1200, Salaries for 14 performers - $2800,Transaction Fees - $847.

Cultural Center run by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism in the town of Lalibela. The
 intimate theater houses a stage and seats for 138 people.  The ongoing show will be performed by local adult Circus and Dance 
Association members working full time. Revenue from ticket sales will 
build 
sustainable income
for the Lalibela Circus and Cultural School and the community. Lalibela holds what some call the 8th wonder of the world, ancient 
architecture carved into the earth, instead of built upon it. We are creating business liaisons with 
the tourist industry to support this employment-creating project, while 
contributing to the community's rich ancient 
culture through modern voices.What We Need & What You Get
We need $14,954 to cover
the costs of fixing the sound system and automated movie screen in the 
UNESCO Cultural Center, a new set of mats, three traditional Ethiopian 
instruments, lights, microphones, sound equipment, traditional costumes 
and
a rehearsal fee of $25 a week for 14  performers. We are planning for a 
2-month
rehearsal schedule. This will enable us to create a
professional show that will be performed regularly for the visitors and 
tourists who come to see the remarkable churches. They will be 
transformed through an experience which exposes them to the 
cultural life, beauty and challenges of the community. Here is the budget breakdown.                                             Mats - $1930, Musical Instruments - $1684, Costumes - $1050, Lights - $1476, Sound equipment - $2467, Set - $1500, Cultural Space Work - $1200, Salaries for 14 performers - $2800,Transaction Fees - $847. Expenses will be prioritized. The show will go on even if full fundraising has not been met, it will just be pared-down.  
Once the show is created we could create a gross income of $345,000 a year. These funds will provide
a good salary for the performers, develop the Circus and Cultural School
as well as fulfill other educational needs of the community. Your contribution
to create this show will have a huge impact..
    I will oversee the distribution of these funds to produce the show.  In partnership with local Ethiopian Associations, we will create and publicize the performance. I will manage the day-to-day operations of
the project. 70% of the profit will go to the community and 30% will cover administrative costs.

Just when

a pregnancy test and having a talk with Sean. Ciara arranges a meeting with Sean but he stands her up. Immediately
Ciara comes home to find Sean, Mike, and crazy Duke watching a football game.
Ciara is upset and outwardly asks Sean why did he stand her up. Subsequently Sean
ignores her, so Ciara grabs the remote and shuts off the TV. She refuses to give
back the remote until Sean agrees to go into their room to talk.  Sean </span><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">grudgingly stomps into to the bedroom  and stipulates five minutes of his time. Ciara immediately let’s

Sean is against her gesture and Ciara asked him “What do I have to do, to get
you to start listening to me?” Sean thinks for a moment and then says, “When
you start wearing the pants, then I’ll start listening to you.” That’s when
Ciara has a light bulb moment, she thanks Sean and leaves out the house. Ciara's attitude instantly changes with a whole new wardrobe to match.</span>

<h3>ABOUT THE WRITER, DIRECTOR &amp; PRODUCER</h3>
<p>Hello my name is Ngozi Thomas, I am 47 years old, a mother, erotic poet, author, playwright and director. </p>
<p>For the past 6 years, I have been taking care of my father who suffers with dementia, diabetes,  and a host of other ailments. Caring for my father is an around-the-clock job which caused me to be extremely withdrawn &amp; depressed. Being a caregiver to your loved one is not easy and things get emotionally taxing. I kept up my strength to care for my father but I stopped taking care of myself. </p>
<p>In the beginning of 2014, I was cleaning out my office space (closet) and I came across one of my many ""in-the works"" scripts (Me &amp; My Girlfriend) and I started crying ""Why didn't I finish this, why did I allow so many years to pass without even attempting to finish it?"" I called a friend of mine and just blurted out that I was going to finished this script and put it on stage.  Yes, of course I freaked out and started to withdraw from the idea. Then Bam! I woke up and started doing whatever was necessary to save money for the theatre's rental fee, plus insurance, plus security deposit, plus my arm, plus... (Just kidding) Now look how thankful and happy I was after leaving the theatre. </p>

ME & MY GIRLFRIEND need to tour the world! Its storyline and the cast are incredible. Your contribution will get us on the road and on the stages of many well known theaters. 

Me & My Girlfriend is about CIARA TATE, who is a
beautiful and smart Entertainment Lawyer. Her life was fine until she meets SEAN
BOYD an intelligent intern with a passion for music. Ciara loved Sean's ambition. She invested a lot of
her time, energy, and love with Sean to only have reality to slap her in the face.
After seven
years of unwedded bliss and being just a “silent business partner”, Ciara takes a disliking
to Sean’s egotistical and narcissistic ways after help building his major
record company. On the eve of her birthday Sean’s arrogance became evident, when he makes an indecent proposal. Instead
of asking Ciara to be his wife, Sean asks her to have his baby. Of course Ciara

ABOUT THE WRITER, DIRECTOR & PRODUCER

For the past 6 years, I have been taking care of my father who suffers with dementia, diabetes,  and a host of other ailments. Caring for my father is an around-the-clock job which caused me to be extremely withdrawn & depressed. Being a caregiver to your loved one is not easy and things get emotionally taxing.

Unfortunately I had not finished the script, so I did what any writer with only fifteen pages of a script written would do... find a muse and have a discussion. Three days and 62 pages later... Presto a finished script and table read!

<b><br/></b><div>
<div><b>INTRODUCTION &amp; BACKGROUND </b></div>
<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">My name is Sebastian Karlsson, 33 years old, and living in Sweden. My father told me that when I was 5 years old I was out playing in the garden, suddenly turning to him and saying: ""Dad, I want to become an actor when I grow up."" I did become an actor. Theatre became a great passion of mine, in the community, in school, and at home. For many years it was my identity. Until God changed my priorities.  </span></div>
<p>In the years of 2006-07, I was studying acting at Blekinge Läns Folkhögskola (acting conservatory in Sweden). As my studies neared completion, a worry of what would happen next started to arise. My prayer was to continue studying theatre at one of Sweden´s four national acting schools. As I was walking on campus, suddenly, the Holy Spirit prompted me to go to the computer lab and search for ""Christian theatre schools in the United States."" I did, and found Abilene Christian University (ACU) in Texas, U.S. </p>
<p>The joy I felt inside when the website of ACU came up was incredible! It was like the theatre program at ACU was tailored just for me. It was just what I had been longing and praying for! </p>
<p>I applied and was accepted to the acting program at Abilene Christian University. (2007-2011 - B.F.A in acting.) Those years changed my life! My faith bloomed out, and Jesus became so real to me after having encountered Him in a powerful way. </p>
<p>During one special week at ACU God spoke to me about my identity. It was a week of transformation. My identity shifted from ""being the actor,"" and from putting my value in what I did on stage to being a child of God. </p>
<p><b>THE CAMPAIGN </b></p>
<p>Two years ago, I felt a prompting to make John´s gospel into a one hour long stage performance. What if theatre could help to spread the message about Jesus? My vision was to produce a high quality show that broke new grounds, touching people through the performing arts. The process of producing this show has truly been amazing. The people involved in completing the show were all non-believers, they were all inspired by it, and touched by it. </p>
<p>The show was named <i>The Gospel of John  </i>and opened on March the 28th 2014. After the curtain call, my neighbor came up to me in tears. The show had touched her and many others in a wonderful way. The show was performed six times. </p>
<p>Now, my wish is to revive the show and take it to new audiences across Sweden, and also abroad. I believe that it is a powerful tool to spread the message about Jesus, using theatre in a new and creative way. This show explores theatre and faith, stage acting and film acting, and dramatic effects through lights and sound. The show is a multimedia production, incorporating film, stage acting, and sound &amp; lights in an innovative and appealing mix, as some parts are prerecorded film clips interacting with live stage performance. All the roles are done by one actor. </p>
<p>It would be much harder to revive and tour with this show without the help and support of contributors. The funds raised would give me a solid base to stand on for this project, and they would greatly help to produce and tour the show. Thank you so much for considering supporting this project! </p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div><ul>
<li>The funds needed to revive the show and to take it on tour is: $18.600</li>
<li>My long-term financial goal for the show is to make it support itself. </li>
<li>The budget is as follows: </li>
</ul></div>
<p>Sound &amp; Light equipment for the show: $5.900                                                            <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Projector &amp; Projector Screen: $2.000                                                                               Salaries (actor &amp; director): $9.400                                                                                           Software: $700                                                                                                                                   Unexpected expenses: $600  </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">If the campaign does not reach the entire goal for the fundraiser, the funds raised will go towards sound &amp; light equipment for the show. This is to make it easier to tour with the show at any given time, without having to be dependent on renting the equipment needed.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>
<h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Perks</span><br/>
</h3>
<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The campaign offers a number of exciting perks. Here are some!</span></div>
<div><ul>
<li>Get a personal thank you note from the actor. </li>
<li>Get a digital download of the show.</li>
<li>Receive a DVD of the show + your name in the credits. </li>
<li>20 min Skype session with the actor. </li>
<li>Support the show and get a free weekend (Fri-Sunday) at Röda Huset café, shop, and hostel in Sweden. (Transportation to Röda Huset, such as airfare, is not provided in this perk).   </li>
</ul></div>
<div></div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>I believe this show can speak to both believers and non-believers in a powerful way. Many times, people who do not have a Christian background hesitate to enter a church building. They might feel uncomfortable to do so. This show has the potential to bring the message of Jesus to people outside the church, to schools, to corporations, to hospitals, to town halls, and other public places. </div>
<div>When the Gospel of John opened in 2014, it played in a small town hall, seating about 60 people. Having the show in that type of building opened up for new audiences. One performance was also given in a theatre space, and had about 40 people in it, of which only one was a Christian. The others were professional and semi-professional theatre people from the region. The response on the show has been very positive! </div>
<div></div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>The show does come with challenges. Sometimes, when promoting something new to churches, it can be met with suspicion. This has been, and might be a future challenge in promoting this show towards congregations. Pastors may ask, ""Is this credible?"" ""Can we trust him?"" and so forth. </div>
<div>When performing in more public venues, there is always a risk of not getting an audience. They might think that because it is the gospel of john then that is nothing for them. The audience can sometimes have a preconceived idea of what the show must be like, based on previous experiences with Christianity. </div>
<div>However, I believe all this can be overcome. By touring with the show, and marketing it in a good, non threatening way, it may open up for new audiences. </div>
<div>Also, by inviting church leaders to a preview of the show they can see what it is about, before taking it to their church venue. </div>
<p></p>

INTRODUCTION & BACKGROUND 
My name is Sebastian Karlsson, 33 years old, and living in Sweden. My father told me that when I was 5 years old I was out playing in the garden, suddenly turning to him and saying: ""Dad, I want to become an actor when I grow up."" I did become an actor. Theatre became a great passion of mine, in the community, in school, and at home. For many years it was my identity. Until God changed my priorities.  
In the years of 2006-07, I was studying acting at Blekinge Läns Folkhögskola (acting conservatory in Sweden). As my studies neared completion, a worry of what would happen next started to arise. My prayer was to continue studying theatre at one of Sweden´s four national acting schools. As I was walking on campus, suddenly, the Holy Spirit prompted me to go to the computer lab and search for ""Christian theatre schools in the United States."" I did, and found Abilene Christian University (ACU) in Texas, U.S. 
The joy I felt inside when the website of ACU came up was incredible! It was like the theatre program at ACU was tailored just for me. It was just what I had been longing and praying for! 
I applied and was accepted to the acting program at Abilene Christian University. (2007-2011 - B.F.A in acting.) Those years changed my life! My faith bloomed out, and Jesus became so real to me after having encountered Him in a powerful way. 
During one special week at ACU God spoke to me about my identity. It was a week of transformation. My identity shifted from ""being the actor,"" and from putting my value in what I did on stage to being a child of God. 
THE CAMPAIGN 
Two years ago, I felt a prompting to make John´s gospel into a one hour long stage performance. What if theatre could help to spread the message about Jesus? My vision was to produce a high quality show that broke new grounds, touching people through the performing arts. The process of producing this show has truly been amazing. The people involved in completing the show were all non-believers, they were all inspired by it, and touched by it. 
The show was named The Gospel of John  and opened on March the 28th 2014. After the curtain call, my neighbor came up to me in tears. The show had touched her and many others in a wonderful way. The show was performed six times. 
Now, my wish is to revive the show and take it to new audiences across Sweden, and also abroad. I believe that it is a powerful tool to spread the message about Jesus, using theatre in a new and creative way. This show explores theatre and faith, stage acting and film acting, and dramatic effects through lights and sound. The show is a multimedia production, incorporating film, stage acting, and sound & lights in an innovative and appealing mix, as some parts are prerecorded film clips interacting with live stage performance. All the roles are done by one actor. 
It would be much harder to revive and tour with this show without the help and support of contributors. The funds raised would give me a solid base to stand on for this project, and they would greatly help to produce and tour the show. Thank you so much for considering supporting this project! 

What We Need & What You Get

The funds needed to revive the show and to take it on tour is: $18.600
My long-term financial goal for the show is to make it support itself. 
The budget is as follows: 

Sound & Light equipment for the show: $5.900                                                            Projector & Projector Screen: $2.000                                                                               Salaries (actor & director): $9.400                                                                                           Software: $700                                                                                                                                   Unexpected expenses: $600  
If the campaign does not reach the entire goal for the fundraiser, the funds raised will go towards sound & light equipment for the show. This is to make it easier to tour with the show at any given time, without having to be dependent on renting the equipment needed.  


Perks

The campaign offers a number of exciting perks. Here are some!

Get a personal thank you note from the actor. 
Get a digital download of the show.
Receive a DVD of the show + your name in the credits. 
20 min Skype session with the actor. 
Support the show and get a free weekend (Fri-Sunday) at Röda Huset café, shop, and hostel in Sweden. (Transportation to Röda Huset, such as airfare, is not provided in this perk).   


The Impact
I believe this show can speak to both believers and non-believers in a powerful way. Many times, people who do not have a Christian background hesitate to enter a church building. They might feel uncomfortable to do so. This show has the potential to bring the message of Jesus to people outside the church, to schools, to corporations, to hospitals, to town halls, and other public places. 
When the Gospel of John opened in 2014, it played in a small town hall, seating about 60 people. Having the show in that type of building opened up for new audiences. One performance was also given in a theatre space, and had about 40 people in it, of which only one was a Christian. The others were professional and semi-professional theatre people from the region. The response on the show has been very positive! 

Risks & Challenges
The show does come with challenges. Sometimes, when promoting something new to churches, it can be met with suspicion. This has been, and might be a future challenge in promoting this show towards congregations. Pastors may ask, ""Is this credible?"" ""Can we trust him?"" and so forth. 
When performing in more public venues, there is always a risk of not getting an audience. They might think that because it is the gospel of john then that is nothing for them. The audience can sometimes have a preconceived idea of what the show must be like, based on previous experiences with Christianity. 
However, I believe all this can be overcome. By touring with the show, and marketing it in a good, non threatening way, it may open up for new audiences. 
Also, by inviting church leaders to a preview of the show they can see what it is about, before taking it to their church venue. 


Other Ways You Can Help
Thank you for considering supporting the project. I am very grateful for any support. Here are some other ways that you can help if you feel unable to support the project financially: 


Please consider to join in prayer for the project. I believe that prayer is very important when breaking new grounds.

</div><p></p><h3>""The 614th Commandment"" </h3><p>Performing on June 2nd, 2016 at 8pm as part of the Expat Expo | Immigrant Invasion Festival at English Theatre Berlin | International Performing Arts Center</p><p></p><ul></ul><ul>
<p></p>
<p>The 614th Commandment is a darkly funny play in which two actors embodying multiple characters examine both the role of Holocaust history in contemporary Jewish identity and American- Jewish perspectives regarding Germany in the <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">21st century, all through a critical, absurdist lens.</span></p>
<p>It is based on over 100 interviews conducted with Jewish people of a variety of backgrounds in Los Angeles, California, and was inspired by the writer’s experiences as an American Jewish woman living in Berlin.</p>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>English Theatre Berlin is providing us with 1000 euro (!!!). We'd like to raise another 2000. Here's where all that money is going:</p><ul>
<li>
<b>The artists!</b> We've assembled a wonderful team to bring this piece to the stage - two actors (Kellen York and Carrie Getman), a director (Adam Donald), and a writer/producer (Alissa Rubinstein). Alissa has been developing the play for over two years, Alissa and Adam have been working together since January, and Kellen and Carrie joined the team in early April. Currently the actors will each receive 300 euro for their time, the director will receive 600 euro and the writer/producer gets nothing because she's organizing the whole thing ;) These people are incredibly talented theater professionals who are dedicating a lot of time and energy to ""The 614th Commandment,"" and Alissa would love to pay them an additional 100-200 euro each, if possible. </li>
<li>
<b>Rehearsal space!</b> We rehearse approximately 10-15 hours/week (10 in April, 15 in May, depending on peoples' schedules), and pay 3-5 euro/hour for the room (depends on which rooms are available at Theaterhaus Berlin-Mitte). For the cost of a latte you could fund an hour of rehearsal time for us!</li>
<li>
<b>Transcription costs!</b> This is a documentary play based on interviews. 7 euro buys us 1 hour of transcription services! We'll spend no more than 300 euro on this. </li>
<li>
<b>Filming!</b> The goal is to make a DVD and/or high quality digital video file that includes the final performance, bits of rehearsal, interviews and other fun behind-the-scenes moments that will be given as a gift to contributors. Stay tuned for price quotes. </li>
<li>
<b>And if we don't make it to 2000 euro</b>...that's fine! Even the smallest contribution helps. Got 3 euro/~$3.50 USD lying around that you want to throw our way? You've just bought us an hour of rehearsal space! </li>
<li>
<b>The minimum we need to put on the show is 1500 euro</b> - that covers the minimum for the actors and director and hopefully most of the rehearsal space hours. If we only have 1500 euro to play with, Alissa has to eat the costs for the rest of the rehearsal space, transcription, filming and any unforeseen expenses. Ideal? No! Totally doable? Yes! No matter how much money we raise/don't raise, the show is HAPPENING.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>This is a funny show. Seriously. </p><ul>
<li>Many of you have probably wondered about the sorts of things ""The 614th Commandment"" addresses - what's going on in Germany right now? Why would an American Jewish millennial choose to live there? What <i>do</i> American Jews think about Germany today, anyway? What do Germans think of American Jews? And what are we all <i>doing</i> with this Holocausty history that ties us all together? </li>

The 614th Commandment is a darkly funny play in which two actors embodying multiple characters examine both the role of Holocaust history in contemporary Jewish identity and American- Jewish perspectives regarding Germany in the 21st century, all through a critical, absurdist lens.
It is based on over 100 interviews conducted with Jewish people of a variety of backgrounds in Los Angeles, California, and was inspired by the writer’s experiences as an American Jewish woman living in Berlin.
What We Need & What You GetEnglish Theatre Berlin is providing us with 1000 euro (!!!). We'd like to raise another 2000. Here's where all that money is going:

The artists! We've assembled a wonderful team to bring this piece to the stage - two actors (Kellen York and Carrie Getman), a director (Adam Donald), and a writer/producer (Alissa Rubinstein). Alissa has been developing the play for over two years, Alissa and Adam have been working together since January, and Kellen and Carrie joined the team in early April. Currently the actors will each receive 300 euro for their time, the director will receive 600 euro and the writer/producer gets nothing because she's organizing the whole thing ;) These people are incredibly talented theater professionals who are dedicating a lot of time and energy to ""The 614th Commandment,"" and Alissa would love to pay them an additional 100-200 euro each, if possible. 

Rehearsal space! We rehearse approximately 10-15 hours/week (10 in April, 15 in May, depending on peoples' schedules), and pay 3-5 euro/hour for the room (depends on which rooms are available at Theaterhaus Berlin-Mitte). For the cost of a latte you could fund an hour of rehearsal time for us!

Transcription costs! This is a documentary play based on interviews. 7 euro buys us 1 hour of transcription services! We'll spend no more than 300 euro on this. 

Filming! The goal is to make a DVD and/or high quality digital video file that includes the final performance, bits of rehearsal, interviews and other fun behind-the-scenes moments that will be given as a gift to contributors. Stay tuned for price quotes. 

And if we don't make it to 2000 euro...that's fine! Even the smallest contribution helps. Got 3 euro/~$3.50 USD lying around that you want to throw our way? You've just bought us an hour of rehearsal space! 

The minimum we need to put on the show is 1500 euro - that covers the minimum for the actors and director and hopefully most of the rehearsal space hours. If we only have 1500 euro to play with, Alissa has to eat the costs for the rest of the rehearsal space, transcription, filming and any unforeseen expenses. Ideal? No! Totally doable? Yes! No matter how much money we raise/don't raise, the show is HAPPENING.
The ImpactThis is a funny show. Seriously. 
Many of you have probably wondered about the sorts of things ""The 614th Commandment"" addresses - what's going on in Germany right now? Why would an American Jewish millennial choose to live there? What do American Jews think about Germany today, anyway? What do Germans think of American Jews? And what are we all doing with this Holocausty history that ties us all together? 
""The 614th Commandment"" is based off of more than 100 interviews that touch on these topics, but this is not your typical sentimental Holocaust story. It's silly, and dark, and absurd, and haunting, and thought-provoking, and hilarious.

We've got hundreds of hours of interviews, and two months to distill them down into 60 fast-paced minutes of exciting theater.

The mapping lineage project aims to document practitioner experiences of ensemble improvisation practices. The project collected over 60 practitioner lineage maps from artist participants at the Form in Question symposium hosted by the Institute for Creative Research at Tisch School of the Arts/NYU in January 2016.  We now wish to publish these lineage maps in an artist book with commentaries in order to provide a valuable resource to artists, practitioners and researchers in the dance field. 

 What We Need & What You Get
  The cost of publishing the book is £3000 GBP
 The book uniquely documents the lineage of prominent practitioners in ensemble improvisation since the 1970s. The maps are both artistically engaging and historically significant.  All funds will go to the cost of publishing the book. 
    
The Impact  The Form in Question Symposium brought together ensemble improvisation practitioners from across the generations.  It was a unique meeting of artists who have documented the lineage of their work through this project that was part of the symposium.

The book is a beautiful artifact and a historical document that will be of use to dance students, scholars, artists and historians.
    
Risks & Challenges  The book will be printed by the Guildford Street Press, a student run press at the University of Bedfordshire, UK.  The book will be bound with a french fold (subject to testing), with a green cover and black riso print on off-white paper inside.  The Guildford Street Press regulary produces book for exhibitions and degree shows.
 Using the Guildford Street Press will help to keep the publication costs down.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Harrison Lang and The Egremont Barn present:</h3>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Spring Awakening!</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Welcome to Harrison Lang's campaign to raise funds for the Berkshires' premiere  production of Steven Sater and Duncan Sheik's Tony Award winning Broadway hit musical, Spring Awakening. Harrison Lang grew up in the Berkshires and is currently a local actor completing his  degree in Musical Theatre at Tulane University.  Back in the fall, the owners of The Egremont Barn and Harrison decided that a new way to attract people to the venue would be to produce a full-fledged musical production in the space that showcases its versatility. This summer a brilliant piece of musical theatre, that has touched millions of people across the world and changed the course of Broadway, will be produced in The Egremont Barn. The Spring Awakening cast and creative team is comprised entirely of young Berkshire County actors who have worked both professionally and regionally. Your contribution to our production will help support the voices of promising up and coming actors as well as help produce a beautiful, important, and timeless piece of musical theatre. </p>
<p>Performances: June 21-24 @ 7:30pm, June 25 @ 2pm</p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>I feel it paramount to pay the people who are devoting their time and energy to his production. Since this is a grassroots project, any contribution helps. All funds raised will go directly to paying some actors, creative team members, and designers, as well as cover fees for costumes, lights, and props. The funds raised will also cover any miscellaneous expenses such as program printing and marketing fees. These things add up and every little bit helps. This is where you come in!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why it matters:</h3>
<p>There is no shortage of beautiful theatre in Berkshire County and I am so excited to share an  essential piece of musical theatre with this community. Spring Awakening is an incredibly meaningful show to me because it allowed me to accept myself for who I was, and I firmly believe it will do the same for our audience members. </p>
<p>By using local artists of different mediums I hope to expand the pool of people who support local theatre. My hope is to see a diverse community in our audiences; teachers, grandparents, musicians, mechanics, lawyers, bus-drivers, comedians, you name it! Good story telling should be accessible to everyone and I want to see you there!</p>
<p>Having done theatre in high school and college, as well as some local theatre since moving back, I've become committed to uplifting the work of young Berkshire County talent. Acting is an incredibly difficult, and often time fruitless profession, but I want to give young talent the opportunity to express themselves through a piece of theatre they are 100% devoted to and passionate about.  </p>
<p>Most importantly, I wish to make theatre accessible to  all  audiences. The arts is a fully accepting community and there is no room for judgement or discrimination. Spring Awakening is a show that is cast based on talent and passion, not race, gender, or religion. It celebrates individuality and the power of communication. </p>

<h3>Who are we, and what's this hullabaloo all about?</h3>
<p>We're Scapegoat Collective! Helmed by Daniel Pagett (Artistic Director) and Sonia Vaillant (Artistic Producer), we're an indie theatre company coming out of Toronto. With combined experience in directing, dramaturgy, acting, design, producing, marketing, playwrighting, and stage and production management, we've got big ideas and the background to make them happen. Scapegoat Collective has produced two shows previously - Big Plans by Jeremy Taylor (directed by Kat Sandler) and Hangman by Jason Maghanoy (directed by Daniel Pagett) - but now we're looking to create original new works, starting with <i>Cloud</i> by Daniel Pagett.</p>
<p>Starting with a small group of people and expanding to the population of Earth, <i>Cloud</i> tells of humanity's discovery of a practical collective consciousness – a more efficient internet, where files are shared in real time, directly to the brain. Not just audio and visuals, but thought files, emotion files, tactile files. What does empathy mean when it is immediately informed by another human’s real-time experience? What does that do to love? To hate? Can we still disagree once our entire life experience is unified? Won't it get lonely when we aren't connected? Won't it get lonely if we're all the same? <i>Cloud</i> explores these questions through traditional and untraditional narrative, and investigates themes of ownership, sex, love, non-monogamy, and the need to feel special.</p>
<p>We have an amazing cast and creative team lined up, and we'll be in the beautiful Artscape Sandbox for our performance run. <i>Cloud</i> is an ambitious, multi-disciplinary project that has the potential to be something really beautiful and meaningful - your contributions will help us craft this alternate world by providing funding for the talented artists making up our team and the materials required to make their vision come to life.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Oh boy, making art is EXPENSIVE, hey?! Luckily we've been on the case for months, and we've been pounding the pavement, staying up late applying for grants, and throwing some super fun events to raise funds for this production. With our extensive roots in indie theatre, we know how to hustle and make a dollar count. That said, we can all use some help.</p>
<p>Because <i>Cloud</i> is a multi-disciplinary production, there are lots of moving parts, which means lots of expenses, but lots of opportunities to work with and employ artists of different backgrounds. Some of our expenses include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Venue - $8,000</li>
<li>Tech costs and building materials - $10,000</li>
<li>Venue and Artist Insurance - $3,000</li>
<li>Marketing - $3,000</li>
</ul>
<p>And that doesn't even include fees for our lovely and talented artists who are making the dream come to life. Every dollar helps us actualize the world of <i>Cloud</i> and get us as much money into the pockets of our artists as possible, because we all know the starving artist trope is overdone and over-romanticized and we really just all love to eat. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>So why <i>Cloud</i> right now?</h3>
<p>As it stands, fear, division, and isolation are used as political weapons. <i>Cloud</i> explores a converse extreme – the possibility of ultimate empathy through a collective consciousness. Our approach for both this production and the development of Scapegoat Collective as an organization, is to combat this loneliness, fear, and isolation. It’s easy to question the value of art when it seems like the sky is falling, but it is through these creative outlets that - we believe - true change can be achieved. The theatre has always been a place for storytelling, discussion, and community. It is a place to safely and thoughtfully challenge ourselves and each other, and a place where anyone can find inclusion and solace. Theatre is a sanctuary that we need more than ever. The ability to sit with strangers and engage with each other and with a piece is pivotal right now. It creates community out of what was previously disconnect.</p>
<p>We know what we are fighting against. Both the production and our process demonstrate what we are fighting for. Community, compassion, and joy are our weapons. Fight with us.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Any theatre practitioner knows that it can be tricky getting people out to the theatre! This project is very ambitious, but luckily we're not afraid of a challenge and our combined experience means we've seen what works and what doesn't in indie theatre because - well, we've been there! We think this show is going to be something really special that people want to talk about and we're all about finding every way possible to make those conversations happen.</p>
<p>This production of <i>Cloud</i> is a springboard for things to come from Scapegoat Collective and we've been fortunate enough to have the support of some amazing organizations and companies so far, INCLUDING Artscape Sandbox, Bad Dog Comedy Theatre, Mugshot Tavern, and Forked River Brewing Co. We're part of a great community and your help strengthens that even more - every little bit counts and nothing goes unnoticed (did we mention how far we can spread a dollar?).</p>
<p>Putting on any theatre show involves a certain amount of risk and brings its fair share of challenges. We've been in the trenches before and we know that not only can we bring <i>Cloud</i> to life, but it's the first stepping stone in the growth of this big-hearted company and it'll allow us to tackle even bigger challenges in the future.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Hey man, we get it! If you can't make a donation, DON'T WORRY. You can support us by helping to spread the word by social media and/or email by using either the Indiegogo share tools at the top of the page, or by linking directly to our campaign!</p>
<p>And if you or anyone know is in Toronto in October, COME SEE THE SHOW! More than anything, we're thrilled to get this bad boy out into the world and start talking to people about it.</p>
<p>Thanks and ever thanks, from the bottom of our goofy indie-theatre hearts.</p>

Not just audio and visuals, but thought files, emotion files, tactile files. What does empathy mean when it is immediately informed by another human’s real-time experience? What does that do to love? To hate? Can we still disagree once our entire life experience is unified? Won't it get lonely when we aren't connected? Won't it get lonely if we're all the same? Cloud explores these questions through traditional and untraditional narrative, and investigates themes of ownership, sex, love, non-monogamy, and the need to feel special.
We have an amazing cast and creative team lined up, and we'll be in the beautiful Artscape Sandbox for our performance run. Cloud is an ambitious, multi-disciplinary project that has the potential to be something really beautiful and meaningful - your contributions will help us craft this alternate world by providing funding for the talented artists making up our team and the materials required to make their vision come to life.

What We Need & What You Get
Oh boy, making art is EXPENSIVE, hey?! Luckily we've been on the case for months, and we've been pounding the pavement, staying up late applying for grants, and throwing some super fun events to raise funds for this production. With our extensive roots in indie theatre, we know how to hustle and make a dollar count. That said, we can all use some help.
Because Cloud is a multi-disciplinary production, there are lots of moving parts, which means lots of expenses, but lots of opportunities to work with and employ artists of different backgrounds. Some of our expenses include:

Venue - $8,000
Tech costs and building materials - $10,000
Venue and Artist Insurance - $3,000
Marketing - $3,000

And that doesn't even include fees for our lovely and talented artists who are making the dream come to life. Every dollar helps us actualize the world of Cloud and get us as much money into the pockets of our artists as possible, because we all know the starving artist trope is overdone and over-romanticized and we really just all love to eat. 

So why Cloud right now?
As it stands, fear, division, and isolation are used as political weapons. Cloud explores a converse extreme – the possibility of ultimate empathy through a collective consciousness. Our approach for both this production and the development of Scapegoat Collective as an organization, is to combat this loneliness, fear, and isolation. It’s easy to question the value of art when it seems like the sky is falling, but it is through these creative outlets that - we believe - true change can be achieved. The theatre has always been a place for storytelling, discussion, and community. It is a place to safely and thoughtfully challenge ourselves and each other, and a place where anyone can find inclusion and solace. Theatre is a sanctuary that we need more than ever. The ability to sit with strangers and engage with each other and with a piece is pivotal right now. It creates community out of what was previously disconnect.
We know what we are fighting against. Both the production and our process demonstrate what we are fighting for. Community, compassion, and joy are our weapons. Fight with us.

Risks & Challenges
Any theatre practitioner knows that it can be tricky getting people out to the theatre! This project is very ambitious, but luckily we're not afraid of a challenge and our combined experience means we've seen what works and what doesn't in indie theatre because - well, we've been there! We think this show is going to be something really special that people want to talk about and we're all about finding every way possible to make those conversations happen.
This production of Cloud is a springboard for things to come from Scapegoat Collective and we've been fortunate enough to have the support of some amazing organizations and companies so far, INCLUDING Artscape Sandbox, Bad Dog Comedy Theatre, Mugshot Tavern, and Forked River Brewing Co. We're part of a great community and your help strengthens that even more - every little bit counts and nothing goes unnoticed (did we mention how far we can spread a dollar?).
Putting on any theatre show involves a certain amount of risk and brings its fair share of challenges. We've been in the trenches before and we know that not only can we bring Cloud to life, but it's the first stepping stone in the growth of this big-hearted company and it'll allow us to tackle even bigger challenges in the future.

Other Ways You Can Help
Hey man, we get it! If you can't make a donation, DON'T WORRY. You can support us by helping to spread the word by social media and/or email by using either the Indiegogo share tools at the top of the page, or by linking directly to our campaign!
And if you or anyone know is in Toronto in October, COME SEE THE SHOW! More than anything, we're thrilled to get this bad boy out into the world and start talking to people about it.
Thanks and ever thanks, from the bottom of our goofy indie-theatre hearts.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>The Goal</h2>
<p>Our goal is simple: Raise funds to pay our cast for the world premiere of this musical at the 2017 Hollywood Fringe festival. We don't want to have to depend on ticket sales to guarantee that the artists helping us get paid for their time and talent.</p>
<p>Small theater in Los Angeles is done because of passion for a project. But we also believe in showing our talented folk that their passion deserves SOMETHING as payment. Please help us make this a guaranteed reality that's not dependent on ticket sales.</p>
<p>We also want to bring this production to our friends all over who want to support us, and shouldn't miss out on this stunning show. This is a follow up attempt at raising funds at the behest of many friends who would be thrilled to see what we've all put so much into this project, and we want to do this right, with professional photography and videography. </p>
<h2>The Show</h2>
<p>Our preview is June 2nd, with only 4 performances following during June. We're focusing on ticket sales and getting audience in to see them, which you should absolutely do if you can, However, if you're not local, or if you can simply spare a few bucks to help us along the way, it would surely contribute to something fantastic!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We've covered so much of this show already. Registration for the festival. Cost of the venue. Promotional materials. Fantastic costumes for 10 performers. Insurance. Amenities during rehearsals. The list goes on producing a show like this, and we're happy to say that we've done it.</p>
<p>We're asking for $2,000 so we may</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay all 10 performers for all 5 performances</li>
<li>Pay for high quality professional pictures and video capture of this show.</li>
</ul>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, the show will go on! We'll use what we get to pay the actors before covering anything else and before paying ourselves back for expenses.</p>
<p>If we exceed our goal, we'll have a few surprises to share with our backers as a thank you. The extra money would put us on great footing for any extension of this show beyond Fringe, which we hope to do.</p>
<p>Simply put, your money goes to the show.</p>

<p><strong>Ehrstrand Dance Collective</strong> is a family of experienced artists representing four continents that works to create and continue international dance exchange and foster global artistic relationships. For the last ten years, we have explored and experimented with the creation of new and exciting work at our <strong>Styggbo Residency and Dansforum Festival</strong> in Sweden. Styggbo Residency, created in 2008 by Helena and Julia Ehrstrand, which began with only 7 dancers, has grown to more than double in size and has become a highly sought-after dance opportunity for contemporary dance artists. Though we, the artists of Ehrstrand Dance Collective, live and work throughout the year in many different countries—including Japan, Mexico, Brazil, Italy, Finland, Sweden, the U.S., and Spain—we come together each year at Styggbo Residency to share, grow, and create within our common language and love of dance. </p>
<p><strong>One of our foremost goals</strong> has always been to build a network of collaboration and community amongst international artists.  We believe that collaboration between artists of different cultures and identities only serves to enrich dance as an art form and a communal language across the globe. Most recently, one of our newest collaborators in Mexico invited Ehrstrand Dance Collective to create work and perform at <strong>Festival Internacional de Danza Contemporánea de la Ciudad de México</strong>, one of the largest dance festivals in Mexico. This is a huge and unique opportunity for us to create connections with new artists we might not otherwise have the chance to meet.  It is a big step towards furthering our goal of growing the current Styggbo Residency/Dansforum Festival into a broader <strong>global network of contemporary dance</strong> residencies and festivals.  <strong>For this project to succeed as we envision it</strong>, we need to raise money to fund transportation for our 9 dancers to travel to Mexico City.

<p>Now more than ever, the conversation between international artists is of extreme importance. We ask that you consider making a contribution to our project and to international contemporary dance as a whole. Please do not miss this opportunity to begin connecting the world through dance!</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>“Paradise Lost: Reclaiming Destiny”</strong> transforms Milton’s elegant text into an epic acrobatic dance on stage and in the air. Jones (Welsh) Talmadge’s innovative vision and dynamic partnering style will incorporate Not Man Apart’s unique brand of physical storytelling with the stunning digital animation effects of both J-Walt Adamczyk and video installation artist Hannah Beavers. You will see bodies flying through space, the creation of the universe and the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve’s Temptation, and the War in Heaven. The powerful visual spectacle integrates with the beautiful choreography to weave a tale filled with emotion and surrounded by evocative music, whether you are familiar with the story from Genesis, Milton’s text, or not at all.</p>
<p>This show offers up a new future, undetermined by the past, free from the need to dominate, and empowers the audience to fully claim a created destiny and connection to the whole.</p>
<p>It’s up to us. Right now. We are not waiting for anything -- we get to create a Heaven on Earth.</p>

<h3>Our Story!</h3>
<p>All the money you donate will help to keep the Storefront Theatre up and KICKING through 2017!</p>
<p>With a banner year behind it, the Storefront Theatre 2017’s Winter Season is all about starting a riot. Whether we’re screaming from the rooftops for water sustainability, crusading for forbidden love, or turning a historical masterpiece on its F#$%ing head, this season the Storefront stage is embracing anarchy and naughtiness to see what we can get away with.</p>
<p>The Storefront Arts Initiative provides affordable and inclusive studio and performance space to artists and collectives. The SAI prioritizes new play development and uses a collaborative model with an emphasis on collective responsibility between artists and administrators and provides meaningful learning opportunities for practitioners.</p>
<p>At the Storefront we value community, and this year our Holidaze Campaign features a fun way for you to give back to YOUR community as well! </p>
<p><strong>2 Ways to play the Break It Forward Challenge</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Donate to the storefront through this campaign then nominate a really hard working friend, family member or colleague to TAKE A BREAK. Make a vid of yourself taking a break, nominate them in the vid, then tag them on Facebook and include our #sftbreakitforward hashtag!</li>
<li>Get nominated by a friend to TAKE A BREAK! Donate to the campaign then create your own BREAK video and Break it Forward to a really hard working friend, family member or colleague. Remember to tag them in your video and don't forget to include our #sftbreakitforward hashtag!</li>
</ul>
<p>In the spirit of the season let's acknowledge and recognize those in our lives who give so much! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The Storefront Arts Initiative is a not for profit organization that operates the Storefront Theatre and Studio in Toronto, Ontario. we ALSO present and co-produce independent Canadian LIVE performance! We opened in 2012 and over the past four years have worked with over 500 artists and had over 75 independent productions take place in our old pharmacy turned theatre on Bloor Street. Our Board of Directors and Management is working diligently to establish the organizational infrastructure that will position us to spearhead a National Storefront Movement. And we do all of this without ANY large scale financial support. That's right kids. No GRANTS and No Corporate Sponsorships! </p>
<p>Your contribution to this campaign will see funds going directly to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Facilities: Front Signage, plumbing and electrical fixes and utilities payments</li>
<li>Artist and Design Fees: Our upcoming production of DIVINE is produced by our Resident Company the Red One Theatre Collective. We are eager to pay our artists, designers and production team a modest wage for this project. </li>
<li>Administrative Bonuses: Did you know that there are over 25(!!!) staff volunteers who work tirelessly to run the Storefront?? From facilities to box office to marketing and producing we are a BIG team! It would be amazing to be able to give all of our hard working staff a little holiday bonus!</li>
</ul>
<h3>SOME OF OUR RAD PERKS INCLUDE: </h3>
<p><strong>TIX TO OUR NEW YEARS EVE NASTY WOMYN/BADBADBOYS CABARET &amp; DUMPSTERDIVE GALA</strong> Real Talk. 2016 was an absolute clusterfuck. BUT WE SHALL NOT SPEAK OF IT. Let's get FABULOUS with no money &amp; usher in 2017 with glamour &amp; style. Spumante Bambino in a champagne flute from Dufferin Mall? Glittering Costume Diamonds paired with a Value Village ball gown/tuxedo. Wear your most fabulous dumpster dive gala chic outfit &amp; let's all pretend we're absolutely fabulous.</p>
<p><b>TIX TO OUR WINTER SEASON OPENER- DIVINE (JAN.20-FEB 6)</b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">#DIVINE It’s 2017, and it’s time to riot. The Storefront Theatre cracks a new year open with a political banger.  Natalie Frijia’s new Canadian play, DIVINE, takes place in an Ontario without water.  A pair of desperate bandits search for their last hope —a water diviner by the name of Penn.  But the bandits aren't the only ones hunting Penn down.  What if there's nothing left for Penn to divine? Co-Produced by the Storefront Arts Initiative’s resident company, the Red One Theatre Collective, DIVINE meshes art with activism, while featuring an all star, all female cast and design team, directed by Storefront Executive Director, Claire Burns. Set in Ontario’s dystopian future, DIVINE is a prophetic cautionary tale told through magical realism and true GRIT.</span></p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>The Storefront Arts Initiative has contributed to a valuable micro-infrastructure of Toronto's entertainment industry. Storefront Theatres act as cultural hubs in urban neighbourhoods and their reclamation of disused or old storefront spaces reinvigorates the tone of a city. In the past four years Storefront has become a local institution (if you can believe it or not!). We are currently in the process of applying for charitable status- once achieved the Storefront will be eligible for more funding opportunities from larger corporate and community donors. Your donation will make a tangible difference in the lives of the artists that work with the organization during this middle period. Thank you so much for your SUPPORT! </p>
</div><div>

All the money you donate will help to keep the Storefront Theatre up and KICKING through 2017!
With a banner year behind it, the Storefront Theatre 2017’s Winter Season is all about starting a riot. Whether we’re screaming from the rooftops for water sustainability, crusading for forbidden love, or turning a historical masterpiece on its F#$%ing head, this season the Storefront stage is embracing anarchy and naughtiness to see what we can get away with.
The Storefront Arts Initiative provides affordable and inclusive studio and performance space to artists and collectives. The SAI prioritizes new play development and uses a collaborative model with an emphasis on collective responsibility between artists and administrators and provides meaningful learning opportunities for practitioners.
At the Storefront we value community, and this year our Holidaze Campaign features a fun way for you to give back to YOUR community as well! 
2 Ways to play the Break It Forward Challenge:

Donate to the storefront through this campaign then nominate a really hard working friend, family member or colleague to TAKE A BREAK. Make a vid of yourself taking a break, nominate them in the vid, then tag them on Facebook and include our #sftbreakitforward hashtag!
Get nominated by a friend to TAKE A BREAK! Donate to the campaign then create your own BREAK video and Break it Forward to a really hard working friend, family member or colleague. Remember to tag them in your video and don't forget to include our #sftbreakitforward hashtag!

In the spirit of the season let's acknowledge and recognize those in our lives who give so much! 

What We Need & What You Get
The Storefront Arts Initiative is a not for profit organization that operates the Storefront Theatre and Studio in Toronto, Ontario. we ALSO present and co-produce independent Canadian LIVE performance! We opened in 2012 and over the past four years have worked with over 500 artists and had over 75 independent productions take place in our old pharmacy turned theatre on Bloor Street. Our Board of Directors and Management is working diligently to establish the organizational infrastructure that will position us to spearhead a National Storefront Movement. And we do all of this without ANY large scale financial support. That's right kids. No GRANTS and No Corporate Sponsorships! 
Your contribution to this campaign will see funds going directly to:

Facilities: Front Signage, plumbing and electrical fixes and utilities payments
Artist and Design Fees: Our upcoming production of DIVINE is produced by our Resident Company the Red One Theatre Collective. We are eager to pay our artists, designers and production team a modest wage for this project. 
Administrative Bonuses: Did you know that there are over 25(!!!) staff volunteers who work tirelessly to run the Storefront?? From facilities to box office to marketing and producing we are a BIG team! It would be amazing to be able to give all of our hard working staff a little holiday bonus!

SOME OF OUR RAD PERKS INCLUDE: 
TIX TO OUR NEW YEARS EVE NASTY WOMYN/BADBADBOYS CABARET & DUMPSTERDIVE GALA Real Talk. 2016 was an absolute clusterfuck. BUT WE SHALL NOT SPEAK OF IT. Let's get FABULOUS with no money & usher in 2017 with glamour & style. Spumante Bambino in a champagne flute from Dufferin Mall? Glittering Costume Diamonds paired with a Value Village ball gown/tuxedo. Wear your most fabulous dumpster dive gala chic outfit & let's all pretend we're absolutely fabulous.
TIX TO OUR WINTER SEASON OPENER- DIVINE (JAN.20-FEB 6)#DIVINE It’s 2017, and it’s time to riot. The Storefront Theatre cracks a new year open with a political banger.  Natalie Frijia’s new Canadian play, DIVINE, takes place in an Ontario without water.  A pair of desperate bandits search for their last hope —a water diviner by the name of Penn.  But the bandits aren't the only ones hunting Penn down.  What if there's nothing left for Penn to divine? Co-Produced by the Storefront Arts Initiative’s resident company, the Red One Theatre Collective, DIVINE meshes art with activism, while featuring an all star, all female cast and design team, directed by Storefront Executive Director, Claire Burns. Set in Ontario’s dystopian future, DIVINE is a prophetic cautionary tale told through magical realism and true GRIT.
The Impact
The Storefront Arts Initiative has contributed to a valuable micro-infrastructure of Toronto's entertainment industry. Storefront Theatres act as cultural hubs in urban neighbourhoods and their reclamation of disused or old storefront spaces reinvigorates the tone of a city. In the past four years Storefront has become a local institution (if you can believe it or not!). We are currently in the process of applying for charitable status- once achieved the Storefront will be eligible for more funding opportunities from larger corporate and community donors. Your donation will make a tangible difference in the lives of the artists that work with the organization during this middle period. Thank you so much for your SUPPORT! 

Last year we successfully raised $10,000 through our #project soundproof campaign. Those funds have been re-allocated into an investment fund that is being saved for moving costs- because people- we HAVE to move. We have a bigger vision for the Storefront than our current tenancy allows. We are currently working with OMG Real Estate to find a long term home! Moving Day Set for July 01, 2018!

While the animal acts and exhibitions have largely fallen out of favor, the unbelievable talents of trapeze artists, aerial performers, fire eaters, and more have become a fixture in America’s cultural history. The few years previous, however, have seen the demise of circus names like the Ringling Brothers, Big Apple Circle, and countless others. The large touring shows can no longer be sustained the way they used to despite the love that audiences have for the circus performers. Even with the impact that circus made in American history, the National Endowment of the Arts (NEA) has never recognized circus as an art form. Given these drawbacks, there’s the great chance that circus art may soon fall off the map of American performing arts within the next few decades.

Interfacing with the 1 million+ festival visitors could inspire the many spinoff projects that come from the Folklife festival, but appealing to the National Endowments of the Arts on how they can help circus arts thrive and flourish in the southeast and across the nation could give circus an official place in the performing arts.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Beyond these conversations, we will be actively seeking funding to produce additional circus productions and shows, build a better circus school and program, and open a circus cabaret performance space here in Atlanta Georgia where children and adults can watch regular performances.  Everything we do would directly impact the current population of circus and variety artists in Atlanta and the future generations that come after us find the resources that they need to produce shows of their own. Together, we keep circus alive!</p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486053447/cmgge3guajxnzf9mkri5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We see very little risks in this project and are fully intent on doing it, whether we send one person or the whole group of ten.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The Smithsonian has confirmed us to be part of the project already. We are confirming the performing artists who will go and best represent us and polishing the performance pieces we wish to premiere.  If we do not reach our full funding goal, we will use the funds we have to fly as many artist as we can (e.i. If we get $5004, we will bring two people to the event, if we get $10,008 will bring four people, etc.). We are intent on going, it's just with how strong of a voice we will have once we get there.</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We realize that some can’t help with a financial contribution and this is okay. While the monetary donation is the best course of action, you can help share this campaign with other circus lovers to help raise awareness of the Smithsonian Folklife Festival. Post it to your Facebook, share it on twitter, or even writing a blog article with links to our official website to talk about the festival. More voices will help spread the word of our mission.

We have worked with over 200 variety performing artists to help them earn a living in entertaining hundreds of thousands of people, taught kids and adults and we have had a sizable impact on the entertainment level and growth in Atlanta Georgia.With your help,  we can keep the circus art alive in America. Interfacing with the 1 million+ festival visitors could inspire the many spinoff projects that come from the Folklife festival, but appealing to the National Endowments of the Arts on how they can help circus arts thrive and flourish in the southeast and across the nation could give circus an official place in the performing arts.Beyond these conversations, we will be actively seeking funding to produce additional circus productions and shows, build a better circus school and program, and open a circus cabaret performance space here in Atlanta Georgia where children and adults can watch regular performances.  Everything we do would directly impact the current population of circus and variety artists in Atlanta and the future generations that come after us find the resources that they need to produce shows of their own. Together, we keep circus alive!Risks & ChallengesWe see very little risks in this project and are fully intent on doing it, whether we send one person or the whole group of ten.The Smithsonian has confirmed us to be part of the project already. We are confirming the performing artists who will go and best represent us and polishing the performance pieces we wish to premiere.  If we do not reach our full funding goal, we will use the funds we have to fly as many artist as we can (e.i. If we get $5004, we will bring two people to the event, if we get $10,008 will bring four people, etc.). We are intent on going, it's just with how strong of a voice we will have once we get there.Other Ways You Can HelpWe realize that some can’t help with a financial contribution and this is okay. While the monetary donation is the best course of action, you can help share this campaign with other circus lovers to help raise awareness of the Smithsonian Folklife Festival. Post it to your Facebook, share it on twitter, or even writing a blog article with links to our official website to talk about the festival. More voices will help spread the word of our mission. (Psst, Indiegogo has some pretty good share tools you can use!)If you would like to discuss other ways in which you can help (with an interview, press release, or tax-exempt donation through our fiscal sponsor Fracture Atlas, or who knows what else), we can also make that happen!Thank you. Truly.  Without people like you helping to support circus, this artform could possibly dwindle and die.  When we say “thank you,” it is from our hearts and from the heart of the Circus!With gratitude and and a loud OPA!-Tim--Timothy MackFounder and Creative DirectorWeb | http://theimperialopa.com",8.0,0,"3 Campaigns

Thus, every cent goes towards a crucial part of the show—and, of course, making <i>Double Vision</i> even more awesome! We can't do it without you.</p><p>Want some examples? With $10—you just printed us some posters. With $50—you rented us rehearsal space for a couple of days. With $100—you put together a fully-orchestrated song. With $250—you just built us a set piece.</p><p>Here's a full breakdown of where your contribution will be going.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>OUR TEAM: 30%</strong></p><p><i>We’re all about the people!  </i>With industry rates for storefront theatre (small, often festival-geared productions like this one) in Chicago, this covers seven incredibly talented cast members and our wonderfully skilled creative/production team:</p><ul>
<li>Director</li>
<li>Music/Vocal Director</li>
<li>Stage Manager</li>
<li>Scenic Designer/Technical Director</li>
<li>Costume Designer</li>
<li>Marketing Coordinator<br/> </li>
</ul><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>FESTIVAL FEES: 20%</strong></p><p><i>We couldn’t do it without the festival!  </i>This helps pay for festival costs like the performance space, a festival publicist, and some incredible festival lighting and sound designers. As one of the participating shows in the 2020 Chicago Musical Theatre Festival, we contribute a small part of the operating costs that make this magical festival possible. <br/> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>MUSIC AND ORCHESTRATIONS: 15%</strong></p><p><i>Hey, it’s a musical!  </i>Therefore, we’re placing a high priority on—you guessed it—our music. Our multi-talented music/vocal director <a href=""http://justinleecavazos.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Justin Cavazos</a> is orchestrating and producing instrumental tracks to both simplify the necessary moving parts and flesh out our music at the same time. Our March 2019 workshop had a four-piece band, and we were able to try out and develop our style through this process. Even though it might seem unconventional for a live show, we’re confident in our music and ready to take that next step to a new, bright, and energetic pop/rock-inspired sound. Get ready—we’ll pop/rock your socks off!<br/> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>MARKETING AND DEVELOPMENT: 15%</strong></p><p><i>We’re looking for more than just butts in seats!  </i>Every design and marketing element represents a crucial part of our show, and we want to make sure we do it justice. This covers graphics by our amazing illustrator/graphic designer <a href=""http://oliviasy.design"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Olivia Sy</a>, original artwork for postcards and exclusive DV prints (get yours through our PERKS!), and printing costs for all of the above. Underscore helps to publicize the whole festival, but we want to make sure our show stands out and that those excited about our show know about it! With five shows and the opportunity for extended dates, we’re investing this money towards expanding our audience.<br/> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>PRODUCTION DESIGN: 10%</strong></p><p><i>Let's bring it to life!  </i>CMTF isn’t geared towards Broadway-scale design or flashy spectacle. However, this covers just enough to add a splash of color and important aesthetic style to the show, including set, costumes, and props. Double Vision is inspired by retro/80s sci-fi, and we’re a show that involves a wormhole (folks, a wormhole—where else can you find that?). Therefore, our production design costs contribute to tools that we’ll use to make this the sci-fi comedy of our (and your!) dreams.<br/> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>REHEARSAL SPACE: 10%</strong></p><p><i>Practice (rehearsal?) makes perfect!  </i>We’re investing in the success of our show by devoting these funds to a rigorous rehearsal schedule for direction and vocal direction. These costs will be going into renting rehearsal spaces, which cost $10-15 per hour. Now, we know that’s a lot of hours, but we’re ready and excited to put in the work!</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569537225/nuvypvwi3bqzqbvjuvmk.png"" src=""""/></h2><p><br/>Hitting our initial campaign goal is awesome and gets us to a baseline for the festival, but going beyond is even more amazing!

Now that we’ve got the platform, we’re working towards change by prioritizing this.  Double Vision hinges upon the portrayal of many different types of love and relationships, including platonic love, romantic love, familial love, love for one’s work, love for one’s life, and love for oneself. The show is threaded with themes of commitment, motivation, love, discovery, and achievement through science fiction and comedic lenses.Through this show, we’re interested in breaking boundaries and subverting musical theatre tropes through the characters’ uniquely intertwining narratives, the diverse cast and creative team guiding this project, and providing an absurdist and comedic twist on musical theatre.We hope Double Vision is a new exemplar of what musical theatre could and can be going forward. We’re really proud of the show we're putting on, and we hope you will be too! Producing a show in Chicago isn't cheap—or easy. Thus, every cent goes towards a crucial part of the show—and, of course, making Double Vision even more awesome! We can't do it without you.Want some examples? With $10—you just printed us some posters. With $50—you rented us rehearsal space for a couple of days. With $100—you put together a fully-orchestrated song. With $250—you just built us a set piece.Here's a full breakdown of where your contribution will be going.OUR TEAM: 30%We’re all about the people!  With industry rates for storefront theatre (small, often festival-geared productions like this one) in Chicago, this covers seven incredibly talented cast members and our wonderfully skilled creative/production team:
Director
Music/Vocal Director
Stage Manager
Scenic Designer/Technical Director
Costume Designer
Marketing Coordinator 
FESTIVAL FEES: 20%We couldn’t do it without the festival!  This helps pay for festival costs like the performance space, a festival publicist, and some incredible festival lighting and sound designers. As one of the participating shows in the 2020 Chicago Musical Theatre Festival, we contribute a small part of the operating costs that make this magical festival possible.  MUSIC AND ORCHESTRATIONS: 15%Hey, it’s a musical!  Therefore, we’re placing a high priority on—you guessed it—our music. Our multi-talented music/vocal director Justin Cavazos is orchestrating and producing instrumental tracks to both simplify the necessary moving parts and flesh out our music at the same time. Our March 2019 workshop had a four-piece band, and we were able to try out and develop our style through this process. Even though it might seem unconventional for a live show, we’re confident in our music and ready to take that next step to a new, bright, and energetic pop/rock-inspired sound. Get ready—we’ll pop/rock your socks off! MARKETING AND DEVELOPMENT: 15%We’re looking for more than just butts in seats!  Every design and marketing element represents a crucial part of our show, and we want to make sure we do it justice. This covers graphics by our amazing illustrator/graphic designer Olivia Sy, original artwork for postcards and exclusive DV prints (get yours through our PERKS!), and printing costs for all of the above. Underscore helps to publicize the whole festival, but we want to make sure our show stands out and that those excited about our show know about it! With five shows and the opportunity for extended dates, we’re investing this money towards expanding our audience. PRODUCTION DESIGN: 10%Let's bring it to life!  CMTF isn’t geared towards Broadway-scale design or flashy spectacle. However, this covers just enough to add a splash of color and important aesthetic style to the show, including set, costumes, and props. Double Vision is inspired by retro/80s sci-fi, and we’re a show that involves a wormhole (folks, a wormhole—where else can you find that?). Therefore, our production design costs contribute to tools that we’ll use to make this the sci-fi comedy of our (and your!) dreams. REHEARSAL SPACE: 10%Practice (rehearsal?) makes perfect!  We’re investing in the success of our show by devoting these funds to a rigorous rehearsal schedule for direction and vocal direction. These costs will be going into renting rehearsal spaces, which cost $10-15 per hour. Now, we know that’s a lot of hours, but we’re ready and excited to put in the work!  Hitting our initial campaign goal is awesome and gets us to a baseline for the festival, but going beyond is even more amazing! We've set up some stretch goals that support not only the production right now, but also the future and longevity of the show. Plus, as our incredible backers, you get access to even MORE stuff!

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Who Are We?</h3>
<p>My name is Linus Karp and I am Artistic Director of Awkward Productions, a company committed to exploring contemporary writing and bringing controversial and taboo subjects to the forefront of our dramatic culture. 'Awkward Conversations with Animals I've F*cked' is the perfect example of just that. It puts an unseen voice centre-stage and challenges our audiences to question their perceptions throughout our hour long dark-comedy.</p>
<p>I first encountered this play on a bookshelf in London and I fell in love straight away. I bought it, read it, and re-read all in one evening. It was unlike anything I had ever encountered before and I knew I had to bring this text to life. I first performed the one-hour monologue in The Lion and Unicorn Theatre in London, a small venue above a pub, where it received an overwhelmingly positive reception. Reviews were filled with praise, and the wonderful Mark Gatiss came to the show and described  it as ""funny and unsettling"". </p>
<p>In August 2018 we were invited by Underbelly to perform at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival where we enjoyed sold-out shows to raving audiences. Following our success in Edinburgh we had a London transfer to the renowned King's Head Theatre in Islington for a three week run in Spring 2019. <a href=""https://twitter.com/edgarwright/status/1121340530972086272"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Edgar Wright</a> saw the show and had this to say...</p>

<p>Coming from Sweden and working as an actor in a second language as well as being a queer artist, the roles available to me are often limited or stereotyped. However, I have been able to thrive in this production. Amidst Brexit chaos and a continued struggle over LGBTQIA+ rights, this production puts a queer European centre-stage for our audiences. This tour is an opportunity for us to bring this incredible piece of work outside of a London-centric theatre scene and share it across the breadth of the UK, but we can only do it with your support!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why This Production?</h3>
<p>So far, I have self-funded the first three runs of this show however, while we have enjoyed success, financially it has been very difficult. This tour will be the biggest outing of the show so far and I need your help to make it a reality. My fantastic production team and I are eager to see this show on tour. I have always made sure that everybody working for me has been paid a fair wages for their work and want guarantee this for a tour. </p>
<p>What we need is financial support in order to secure a decent wage for the creatives involved, transportation for the cast and crew as well as our set and technical equipment, petrol, accommodation and marketing.</p>

<p>Realistically we need £3,200 in order to cover all of our expenses and guarantee that the show will be the best that it can be. I have been working for the past few months in order to pay for the venues, the rights to perform the play, and secure our director and producer for this run - all of which have already been paid for. This Indiegogo is going to help propel the show to even greater heights as I cannot fund the entire project alone.</p>
<p>We're excited to offer a wide range of perks for all of our contributors, ranging from personalised postcards from the theatres we visit to Executive Producer credits on the final production. Make sure to check out everything we have on offer to see what suits you best!</p>
<p>We're hoping to achieve our goals during the lead up to this production but we're prepared to work on a smaller budget if need be. We want to give this show the best space, materials and technical support to demonstrate everything it has to say in the most powerful and gripping way for our audiences.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3>
<p>""Hayes rampant exploration of loneliness, mental health and bestiality will have you moved whilst wetting yourself with laughter"" - <strong>Voice Magazine </strong></p>
<p>We're bringing a successful and acclaimed production that discusses both toxic masculinity and the effects of loneliness on a young man's mental health. This is a production that interrogates the relationship between fathers and sons, tackling how emotional abuse can impact and negatively affect the development of one's sense of self.</p>
<p>""my companion to the show, and I had a lengthy discussion afterwards about Awkward Conversations... if we hadn’t had to part for our separate trains, I think we could still be discussing Bobby and his actions now."" - <strong>London Theatre 1</strong></p>
<p>In bringing this production across the UK, we're hoping to provoke discussions amongst our audience while at the same time using humour as a bridge to make the uncomfortable topics within the play easily accessible. There is no other play like this to be found on the UK theatre scene at the moment. </p>
<p>This production has already thrived in London and Edinburgh with five star reviews and sold-out performances, we only expect it to soar to new heights on tour! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Going on tour, we will be taking the show to new cities where we don't have an immediate audience. However, we have a strong social media campaign and we are working with each theatre's marketing department in order to get the word out about the show before we arrive. We want to make sure that we are engaging with audiences from all walks of life as we know that this production has universal messages that everyone can connect to. </p>
<p>As we already have a finished production that is cast, designed, and ready to go, as well as venues already booked across the UK, we are in a very strong position to see this show succeed.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">I Can't Donate But I Want To Contribute</h3>
<p>We completely understand if you can't make a financial donation but there are still a ton of ways you can help support this project!</p>
<p>1) You can share this campaign on your social media platforms. </p>
<p>2) You can follow us on social media so you can stay up to date on Awkward Conversations as we travel the country. We're @AwkwardProds on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.</p>
<p>3) If we're not coming to a theatre near you and you want to see us there, tweet your local theatres that you want to see us there!</p>
<p>4) Last but not least, come and see our performances across Autumn 2019! We want to share this piece with you and we cannot wait for you to see it.</p>

I have been working for the past few months in order to pay for the venues, the rights to perform the play, and secure our director and producer for this run - all of which have already been paid for. This Indiegogo is going to help propel the show to even greater heights as I cannot fund the entire project alone.
We're excited to offer a wide range of perks for all of our contributors, ranging from personalised postcards from the theatres we visit to Executive Producer credits on the final production. Make sure to check out everything we have on offer to see what suits you best!
We're hoping to achieve our goals during the lead up to this production but we're prepared to work on a smaller budget if need be. We want to give this show the best space, materials and technical support to demonstrate everything it has to say in the most powerful and gripping way for our audiences.
 

The Impact
""Hayes rampant exploration of loneliness, mental health and bestiality will have you moved whilst wetting yourself with laughter"" - Voice Magazine 
We're bringing a successful and acclaimed production that discusses both toxic masculinity and the effects of loneliness on a young man's mental health. This is a production that interrogates the relationship between fathers and sons, tackling how emotional abuse can impact and negatively affect the development of one's sense of self.
""my companion to the show, and I had a lengthy discussion afterwards about Awkward Conversations... if we hadn’t had to part for our separate trains, I think we could still be discussing Bobby and his actions now."" - London Theatre 1
In bringing this production across the UK, we're hoping to provoke discussions amongst our audience while at the same time using humour as a bridge to make the uncomfortable topics within the play easily accessible. There is no other play like this to be found on the UK theatre scene at the moment. 
This production has already thrived in London and Edinburgh with five star reviews and sold-out performances, we only expect it to soar to new heights on tour! 
 

Risks & Challenges
Going on tour, we will be taking the show to new cities where we don't have an immediate audience. However, we have a strong social media campaign and we are working with each theatre's marketing department in order to get the word out about the show before we arrive. We want to make sure that we are engaging with audiences from all walks of life as we know that this production has universal messages that everyone can connect to. 
As we already have a finished production that is cast, designed, and ready to go, as well as venues already booked across the UK, we are in a very strong position to see this show succeed.
 

I Can't Donate But I Want To Contribute
We completely understand if you can't make a financial donation but there are still a ton of ways you can help support this project!
1) You can share this campaign on your social media platforms. 
2) You can follow us on social media so you can stay up to date on Awkward Conversations as we travel the country. We're @AwkwardProds on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

4) Last but not least, come and see our performances across Autumn 2019! We want to share this piece with you and we cannot wait for you to see it.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>When Nathanael Lee (producer, director &amp; actor) approached me (Zabet NeuCollins) to help him co-produce <i>The Mystery of Irma Vep - A Penny Dreadful </i>by Charles Ludlam, I was a little hesitant. It wasn't because the play didn't capture my attention -- quite the contrary! Reading the script had me giggling uncontrollably. No, I was more worried that the play would be too much of a production for us to put on. Both Nathanael and I have a very high standard in the work that we create. How could we expect to put on a professional show, up to our own standards, with our limited budget and resources? However, Nathanael was persistent and he soon convinced me that it was worth a shot.</p>
<p>It is without doubt that Nathanael's enthusiasm has got us where we are today. However, to my amazement, local actors and artists stepped out of the woodwork to support us in this venture. Ed Dillon, the set designer, is ingenious! To our first production meeting (literally just a ""meet-and-greet""), he brought miniature cardboard cutouts of the set! Thomas VanGorder, the other actor, brings levity to every rehearsal. And there are more:  Kate, the stage manager, Stephanie, the costume designer, Chuck the sound designer, Didi on lights, Mark the music-score man and Garrett, the poster designer. What's that saying? ""If you want to go fast, go alone; but if you want to go far, go together.""</p>
<p>We are so excited to be able to produce this show with the help of the Criterion Theatre in Bar Harbor, Maine. However, we are in need of $1500 to help us cover expenses such as rights, costumes, and stage props. With your help, we'll be able to make this show a top quality production that we all enjoy being a part of.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>The bulk of the money we fund-raise will go to the custom set Ed Dillon is creating, along with prop-pieces and furniture items we purchase to decorate the stage. The remainder will go towards custom-made costumes. This play has eight characters but only two actors, resulting in many  quick costume changes. Simple costumes that at the same time depict characters of different genders and statures are hard to find: that is why all our costumes will be custom made by Stephanie Urquhart.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if a financial donation is out of the question, we can sure use your help! First and foremost, please spread the word about our project. We would love to see you, your family, your friends, and your acquaintances in the audience!</p>
<p>Second, we are on the look out for stage-hands and any back-stage helpers that can assist us during the actual performance(s) to change the set, help with costume changes, and more. Please contact us if this is something you'd be interested in!</p>

<p>Club Sol Party went on to debut at The Canal Cafe Theatre to a sold out audience. It then moved closer into town to The Leicester Square Theatre where it also enjoyed a sold out run.

The Club Sol reps were in demand and began organising and delivering bespoke comedy events, parties and corporate gigs including organising Summer parties for regular clients Virgin Holidays.</p>
<p>The show is also well known for  giving notable cabaret and comedy performers the opportunity to come down and show what they've got at Club Sol's monthly comedy residency at the prestigious Century Club and various nights at the awesome Bethnal Green Working Men's Club.  </p>

<h3>Yes, and..The Beginning</h3>
<p>Back in 2009, at the dawn of the Improv Era in Bulgaria, 5 enthusiasts who just graduated the National Academy of Theatre and Film Arts, started improvising in a park. A few months later they hosted their first performance in the hallway of a rundown community center built in the 1930s. Out of the 40 invitees, 20 people showed up. You know it was before Facebook events were a thing in Bulgaria too.<br/>They did short form improv - fast and fun.<br/>In 2013, after a successful run in the 150 seat venue of the same community center, one of these enthusiasts - Zlatin - created the first longform improv company - ShiZi Pro.<br/>Now we are a growing community of improvisers, striving to create a variety of improv shows. Fast, fun, deep, meaningful, happy, with music, without music, in rhyme, but always in the rhythm of cooperation, trust, support and teamwork (group mind).  </p>
<p>In the last 8 years, more that 300 people of all ages and backgrounds were introduced to the art of improv via our training center.</p>
<h2>Yes, and...The Dream</h2>
<p>The community center ""Slavyanska Beseda"" did an essential role in nurturing the growth of improv in Bulgaria. Initially, when improv was unknown to Bulgarians, the center provided rehearsal space and the 150 seat venue rent-free. It has been a home for improv shows ever since. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, it hasn't been renovated for more than 12 years. The entrance and the staircase are in bad condition. So is the electrical system and the lights. Most needed is the replacement of the seats in the main venue and the repainting of the lobby, which will become a dedicated stage for improv performances. </p>
<p>We dream of opening the First Improv Comedy Club in Sofia at the very heart of the community center. It will host newly formed groups, both long and short form shows, seminars to spread the word of improv and much more. A place to relax and read a book about improv during the day or be inspired by an imaginative show at night. Where you can meet like minded collaborative ""yes, and""-ing individuals. A place worthy of hosting an International Improv Festival in Sofia, Bulgaria. </p>

<h3>The story so far</h3>
<p>Hello, I am Michael B. Judkins, and I would like to introduce you to my poetry collection, Interlude to Sentimental Me! It is the second in the Sentimental Me series and was released by aois21 publishing in May 2016. As I traveled promoting my book and reading my poetry, I decided that I wanted to do something more. After working with a playwright, we have turned the section Mercury Rising into a stage production, bringing my work to a new medium and a new audience. Help me as we bring my work to the stage!</p>
<p>Judkins announced December 1st on his Facebook page that Union Baptist Church- Brother Knoxley and the Youth committee will be the first venue to host the stage play production. With that information known, Judkins will be holding a table read for script review and such prior to announcing open auditions in January 2018. </p>

<h3>Short Summary/ Sommaire</h3>
<p><strong>Babellodrome</strong>:</p>
<p>BABELLODROME is a multimedia and multi-lingual audience participatory show presented by the collective collectif BUS 1.2.3. with the participation of the Element choir and Choeur Maha. The site-specific interactive performance looks at the following question: in today's globalized media chaos, in a world where fiction and reality (real and virtual) collide with ""alternative facts"" and ""fake news"", what is our own reality ... how do we define ourselves when confronted with commercial and political propaganda that tells us what to believe? Combining poetry, humour and fantasy, this show tackles the question in a series of scenes combining dia- logue, visuals, live music and audience participation.</p>
<p>Large-scale video projections and live music make it a unique and intriguing show that can inspire the imagi- nation of audiences of all ages. The performance is in the form of a journey, a procession along a path, tra- velling from one scene to another, It follows characters who are sometimes humourous, sometimes mythical, and who while in search of their identity, live through multiple technological and linguistic challenges: pro- blems of communication, erroneous translations, senseless games and fake ads. When they finally reach their destination, they rediscover their true nature, free of all media artifice: a return to their essence.</p>
<p>This piece is inspired by Argentinian author Jorge Luis Borges' short story ""Library of Babel"". We feel it's im- portant because it continues the dialogue about the immigrant experience shifting between cultures, and ex- plores the complexities of language, communication and identity.<br/>Babellodrome est un spectacle francophone participatif, multimédia et multilingue présenté par le collectif BUS 1.2.3. en collaboration avec le chœur Element. La performance interactive in situ se penche sur la question suivante: dans le chaos médiatique et globalisé actuel, dans un monde où s'entrechoquent fiction et réalité (réelle et virtuelle) jusqu'aux ""faits alternatifs"" et aux ""nouvelles fictives"", quelles sont nos réalités... comment se définir en opposition aux propagandes commerciales et politiques? Alliant poésie, humour et fantaisie, ce spectacle aborde la question sous forme de tableaux dialogués, visuels et musicaux, avec participation du public.<br/><br/>Les projections vidéo à grande échelle et la musique en direct en font un spectacle unique et intriguant qui inspire l’imaginaire d’un public de tout âge. Cette performance foisonne de personnages tantôt parodiques, tantôt mythiques, qui cheminent au travers des nouvelles technologies à la recherche de leur identité.<br/><br/>En cours de route, les protagonistes vivent de multiples péripéties: problèmes de communication, traductions erronées, jeux insensés et publicités fictives. Au moment où leur quête culmine, ils retrouvent leur nature véritable, dénudée de tout artifice médiatique: une renaissance de l’essentiel.</p>
<p><strong>Our Goals/ </strong><b>Nos Objectifs</b>:</p>
<p>There are three main goals to the project:<br/>The first goal is interaction with the public. We believe that members of the audience complement and com- plete the performance by participating in it and moving through the piece going from one scene to the other. The audience will be involved making sounds from typewriters according to timings determined by the per- formers, playing an abstract version of scrabble, and participating in a fake conference. They'll be asked to answer questions, tell stories, translate sentences.... By including them in the action of the piece, we hope to invite them to begin their own questioning on the themes of the piece.</p>
<p>The second goal is to have the location transform the piece. The benefit of performing in a site specific loca- tion is that it gives us the opportunity to draw from the area's local history and architecture and use the local environment to inform the work.</p>
<p>The third goal is to collaborate with Christine Duncan and the Element Choir, and Kathy Kennedy and the Choeur Maha. We feel we share the same creative processes that would greatly benefit this production, both in amplifying and complementing the themes of the project as well as bringing an inter-generational and multi-disciplinary element to the piece. </p>
<p><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>Le premier objectif est l'interaction avec le public. Nous croyons que le public complémente et complète la performance en y participant tout en se déplaçant d'une scène à l'autre. Les spectacles pop-up intégreront lee membres du public en les mpliquant dans la production de sons à partir de machines à écrire, en jouant une version abstraite de Scrabble et en participant à une fausse conférence. On leur demandera de répondre aux questions, de raconter des histoires, de traduire des phrases ... En les incluant dans l'action de la pièce, nous espérons les inciter à leur propre questionnement par rapport aux thèmes de la pièce.</span></p>
<p><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Le deuxième objectif est de permettre au site de transformer la pièce. L'avantage de se produire dans un emplacement spécifique est qu'il nous donne l'opportunité de s'inspirer de l'histoire et de l'architecture locales afin d'informer l’installation et le déroulement de la performance.</span></font></p>
<p><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Le troisième objectif est de collaborer avec Christine Duncan et le choeur Element. Nous estimons que nous partageons les mêmes processus créatifs qui profiteraient grandement à cette production, à la fois en amplifiant et en complétant les thèmes du projet et en apportant un élément intergénérationnel et multidisciplinaire à la pièce.</span></font></p>
<p> <strong>Collectif BUS 1.2.3:</strong></p>
<p>Collectif BUS 1.2.3.,based in Toronto, is a multi-lingual and multimedia not-for-profit professional collective formed in 1991. The group presented BUS 1.2.3, its first creation, at the Festival of Independent Dance Artists (fFIDA) in Toronto the following year. The play questioned the influence of new technologies on society at a time when the Internet was still in its infancy. </p>
<p>Twenty years later, many of the original members of the collective came together again to remount the piece and update it according to current issues. Thanks to several grants from the Ontario Arts Council (2012-2015) and a project grant from the Canada Council, the collective was able to conduct several intensive research residencies, based on improvisation and collaborative creation techniques. It went on to develop a finished theatrical piece presented in a theatrical setting in 2015. The new work, building on themes of language, communication and identity, became a multi-generational, multi-lingual and multimedia production titled Babelle et Barbarie. It was presented at the Winchester St. Theatre for four nights in September 2015. The collective then decided to re-imagine the work for the public space and focus on public participation. This new piece is title ""Babelledrome.""</p>
<p>The original piece was built on improvisation, a creative process the collective decided to keep. Motivated by the desire to critique media's place in contemporary society, the collective retains elements of its previous creations (videos, recordings, musical compositions and songs ...) and reintegrates them in new projects under development. The scenic writing of the collective is based on a rich language constructed from several vocabularies, including video, music, text and performance, exploring the themes of the piece in a multi-sensory technological environment. This approach requires collaboration between singers, actors, musicians and videographer; an approach the group has been practicing since its inception. The performance doesn't therefore rest solely on text and is thus more akin to performance art than conventional theatre.</p>
<p>Le collectif BUS 1.2.3 est un collectif multidisciplinaire et multilingue formé en 1991. Il a présenté sa première création BUS 1.2.3 au fringe Festival of Independant Dance Artists (fFIDA) à Toronto l'année suivante. La pièce questionnait la place des nouvelles technologies dans la société contemporaine au moment de la naissance d’Internet.</p>
<p>Vingt ans plus tard, des membres originaux du collectif se sont réunis afin de reprendre la pièce et d’en actualiser les enjeux. Cette nouvelle collaboration a conduit à la création du spectacle multilingue Babelle et Barbarie (B+B) présenté en septembre 2015 au Winchester St. Theatre à Toronto. Les thèmes utilisés cette fois-ci portaient sur le langage, l’identité et la communication. Après ces représentations, le collectif a décidé de poursuivre sa réflexion en ré-imaginant l’oeuvre dans l’espace public et en se concentrant sur la participation du public.</p>
<p>La pièce originelle avait été bâtie sur un travail d’improvisation, processus créatif que le collectif a décidé de conserver. Réuni par la volonté de proposer une réflexion sur la place des médias, le collectif conserve des éléments de ses précédentes créations (vidéos, enregistrement, compositions musicales et chantées…) et les réintègrent dans les nouveaux projets en cours de développement. La démarche du collectif est ainsi inscrite dans le temps et s’adapte aux nouveaux enjeux technologiques et aux nouveaux comportements des publics.</p>
<p>L’écriture scénique du collectif s'appuie sur un langage fécond s'abreuvant à plusieurs vocabulaires, dont celui de la vidéo, de la musique, du texte et de la performance, explorant les thèmes de la pièce dans un environnement technologique multi sensoriel.</p>
<p>Cette approche exige une confrontation entre chanteuses, comédiens, musiciens et vidéaste ; un travail collaboratif tel que le groupe le pratique depuis ses débuts. Le spectacle s'apparente ainsi plus à de la performance scénique qu'à un théâtre conventionnel où tout reposerait sur le textuel.</p>
<p><strong>Christine Duncan and the Element Choir:</strong></p>
<p>The Element Choir is an improvising choir from Toronto led by vocalist Christine Duncan. This is a group that works with both structured and non-structured elements, based primarily on a system of conduction cues. As an ensemble they explore textural and timbral sound qualities, soundscapes, rhythmic patterns, sound poetry, group and individual composition ideas, musical genre interplay and extended voice techniques. This cinematic approach to group vocalizing presents both tonal and non-tonal material in a constantly evolving and ‘in the moment’ sonic environment.</p>
<p>A musical chameleon with a near five octave range, Christine Duncan uses her voice as an instrument, exploring its full tonal, timbral and textural range. She is involved with everything from jazz, R&amp;B, gospel, improvised music, sound poetry, to new music and musique actuelle.<br/>She performs with many musical groups and projects, most notably Hugh Fraser’s VEJI (Vancouver Ensemble of Jazz Improvisation) and Barnyard Drama with drummer/electronic artist Jean Martin. Christine also teaches voice in the jazz programs at Humber College and the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>The Element Choir has performed and recorded with Tanya Tagaq, as well as participated in the Apocalysis (Luminato Festival) Barnyard Drama, with Tim Berne and Snake Oil,  Shelter Opera (Tapestry New Opera), Hard Rubber Orchestra tribute to Kenny Wheeler, Veryan Weston,  Inverted Mountains, with Coleman Lemieux &amp; Compagnie, Idiolalla West Coast Tour with DB Boyko,  L’Off Festival (Montreal) and William Parker (Guelph Jazz Festival)</p>

Babellodrome:
BABELLODROME is a multimedia and multi-lingual audience participatory show presented by the collective collectif BUS 1.2.3. with the participation of the Element choir and Choeur Maha. The site-specific interactive performance looks at the following question: in today's globalized media chaos, in a world where fiction and reality (real and virtual) collide with ""alternative facts"" and ""fake news"", what is our own reality ... how do we define ourselves when confronted with commercial and political propaganda that tells us what to believe? Combining poetry, humour and fantasy, this show tackles the question in a series of scenes combining dia- logue, visuals, live music and audience participation.
Large-scale video projections and live music make it a unique and intriguing show that can inspire the imagi- nation of audiences of all ages. The performance is in the form of a journey, a procession along a path, tra- velling from one scene to another, It follows characters who are sometimes humourous, sometimes mythical, and who while in search of their identity, live through multiple technological and linguistic challenges: pro- blems of communication, erroneous translations, senseless games and fake ads. When they finally reach their destination, they rediscover their true nature, free of all media artifice: a return to their essence.
This piece is inspired by Argentinian author Jorge Luis Borges' short story ""Library of Babel"". We feel it's im- portant because it continues the dialogue about the immigrant experience shifting between cultures, and ex- plores the complexities of language, communication and identity.Babellodrome est un spectacle francophone participatif, multimédia et multilingue présenté par le collectif BUS 1.2.3. en collaboration avec le chœur Element. La performance interactive in situ se penche sur la question suivante: dans le chaos médiatique et globalisé actuel, dans un monde où s'entrechoquent fiction et réalité (réelle et virtuelle) jusqu'aux ""faits alternatifs"" et aux ""nouvelles fictives"", quelles sont nos réalités... comment se définir en opposition aux propagandes commerciales et politiques? Alliant poésie, humour et fantaisie, ce spectacle aborde la question sous forme de tableaux dialogués, visuels et musicaux, avec participation du public.Les projections vidéo à grande échelle et la musique en direct en font un spectacle unique et intriguant qui inspire l’imaginaire d’un public de tout âge. Cette performance foisonne de personnages tantôt parodiques, tantôt mythiques, qui cheminent au travers des nouvelles technologies à la recherche de leur identité.En cours de route, les protagonistes vivent de multiples péripéties: problèmes de communication, traductions erronées, jeux insensés et publicités fictives. Au moment où leur quête culmine, ils retrouvent leur nature véritable, dénudée de tout artifice médiatique: une renaissance de l’essentiel.
Our Goals/ Nos Objectifs:
There are three main goals to the project:The first goal is interaction with the public. We believe that members of the audience complement and com- plete the performance by participating in it and moving through the piece going from one scene to the other. The audience will be involved making sounds from typewriters according to timings determined by the per- formers, playing an abstract version of scrabble, and participating in a fake conference. They'll be asked to answer questions, tell stories, translate sentences.... By including them in the action of the piece, we hope to invite them to begin their own questioning on the themes of the piece.
The second goal is to have the location transform the piece. The benefit of performing in a site specific loca- tion is that it gives us the opportunity to draw from the area's local history and architecture and use the local environment to inform the work.
The third goal is to collaborate with Christine Duncan and the Element Choir, and Kathy Kennedy and the Choeur Maha. We feel we share the same creative processes that would greatly benefit this production, both in amplifying and complementing the themes of the project as well as bringing an inter-generational and multi-disciplinary element to the piece. 
Le premier objectif est l'interaction avec le public. Nous croyons que le public complémente et complète la performance en y participant tout en se déplaçant d'une scène à l'autre. Les spectacles pop-up intégreront lee membres du public en les mpliquant dans la production de sons à partir de machines à écrire, en jouant une version abstraite de Scrabble et en participant à une fausse conférence. On leur demandera de répondre aux questions, de raconter des histoires, de traduire des phrases ... En les incluant dans l'action de la pièce, nous espérons les inciter à leur propre questionnement par rapport aux thèmes de la pièce.
Le deuxième objectif est de permettre au site de transformer la pièce. L'avantage de se produire dans un emplacement spécifique est qu'il nous donne l'opportunité de s'inspirer de l'histoire et de l'architecture locales afin d'informer l’installation et le déroulement de la performance.
Le troisième objectif est de collaborer avec Christine Duncan et le choeur Element. Nous estimons que nous partageons les mêmes processus créatifs qui profiteraient grandement à cette production, à la fois en amplifiant et en complétant les thèmes du projet et en apportant un élément intergénérationnel et multidisciplinaire à la pièce.
 Collectif BUS 1.2.3:
Collectif BUS 1.2.3.,based in Toronto, is a multi-lingual and multimedia not-for-profit professional collective formed in 1991. The group presented BUS 1.2.3, its first creation, at the Festival of Independent Dance Artists (fFIDA) in Toronto the following year. The play questioned the influence of new technologies on society at a time when the Internet was still in its infancy. 
Twenty years later, many of the original members of the collective came together again to remount the piece and update it according to current issues. Thanks to several grants from the Ontario Arts Council (2012-2015) and a project grant from the Canada Council, the collective was able to conduct several intensive research residencies, based on improvisation and collaborative creation techniques. It went on to develop a finished theatrical piece presented in a theatrical setting in 2015. The new work, building on themes of language, communication and identity, became a multi-generational, multi-lingual and multimedia production titled Babelle et Barbarie. It was presented at the Winchester St. Theatre for four nights in September 2015. The collective then decided to re-imagine the work for the public space and focus on public participation. This new piece is title ""Babelledrome.""
The original piece was built on improvisation, a creative process the collective decided to keep. Motivated by the desire to critique media's place in contemporary society, the collective retains elements of its previous creations (videos, recordings, musical compositions and songs ...) and reintegrates them in new projects under development. The scenic writing of the collective is based on a rich language constructed from several vocabularies, including video, music, text and performance, exploring the themes of the piece in a multi-sensory technological environment. This approach requires collaboration between singers, actors, musicians and videographer; an approach the group has been practicing since its inception. The performance doesn't therefore rest solely on text and is thus more akin to performance art than conventional theatre.
Le collectif BUS 1.2.3 est un collectif multidisciplinaire et multilingue formé en 1991. Il a présenté sa première création BUS 1.2.3 au fringe Festival of Independant Dance Artists (fFIDA) à Toronto l'année suivante. La pièce questionnait la place des nouvelles technologies dans la société contemporaine au moment de la naissance d’Internet.
Vingt ans plus tard, des membres originaux du collectif se sont réunis afin de reprendre la pièce et d’en actualiser les enjeux. Cette nouvelle collaboration a conduit à la création du spectacle multilingue Babelle et Barbarie (B+B) présenté en septembre 2015 au Winchester St. Theatre à Toronto. Les thèmes utilisés cette fois-ci portaient sur le langage, l’identité et la communication. Après ces représentations, le collectif a décidé de poursuivre sa réflexion en ré-imaginant l’oeuvre dans l’espace public et en se concentrant sur la participation du public.
La pièce originelle avait été bâtie sur un travail d’improvisation, processus créatif que le collectif a décidé de conserver. Réuni par la volonté de proposer une réflexion sur la place des médias, le collectif conserve des éléments de ses précédentes créations (vidéos, enregistrement, compositions musicales et chantées…) et les réintègrent dans les nouveaux projets en cours de développement. La démarche du collectif est ainsi inscrite dans le temps et s’adapte aux nouveaux enjeux technologiques et aux nouveaux comportements des publics.
L’écriture scénique du collectif s'appuie sur un langage fécond s'abreuvant à plusieurs vocabulaires, dont celui de la vidéo, de la musique, du texte et de la performance, explorant les thèmes de la pièce dans un environnement technologique multi sensoriel.
Cette approche exige une confrontation entre chanteuses, comédiens, musiciens et vidéaste ; un travail collaboratif tel que le groupe le pratique depuis ses débuts. Le spectacle s'apparente ainsi plus à de la performance scénique qu'à un théâtre conventionnel où tout reposerait sur le textuel.

No, no I mean, you know steal money from my tip jar, beat me out of a couple hours on my check. And an agent who, I think, had his eyes on the perfect body. They all seemed to be stroking you and fucking you at the same time. Sort of the worst kind of lover, the kind you can’t trust. This town is the kind of lover that lies to you with a smile on its face and it’s hand on your dick."" - Ruby's Arms</strong></i></p>

<p><i>""I come across a lot of actors. I’ve met bad ones, good ones and great ones. Everyone from 1st year acting students, to the actor who has no chops, but no one ever tells him; to some of the greats like James Earl Jones, Sean Penn and Glenn Close. I mention Glenn Close in particular, because what she seems like on screen she is not in person. On screen she seems like this 6 foot tall ball crunching beast. In person, Glenn Close is maybe 5 ft2, 5 ft3 at best (even though IMDB says she’s 5 foot 5) and speaks with a tiny voice to strangers and appears a bit detached. Sandy Duarte is the Portuguese Glenn Close. Blood, is certainly not a Vampire story. But it’s got teeth. And it’s coming at you with a mouthful, gnashing away at every fiber of your being in the form of Sandy Duarte.

</div>
<div>
<p>""I first saw Sandy Duarte in an independent production of Something Red. She was astounding. Through Sandy’s powerful performance, she somehow re-wrote Elizabeth, turning her into a character much more three dimensional than I’d thought possible. No other actor had managed to bring the role to life since the first production in 1978. I had always blamed the writing, but Sandy overcame any deficiencies of my own. For the first time, I liked the play.</p>
<p>I urged her to act in a production of Blood - it is the best role I've written for a woman and I knew it would give her a chance to stretch her wings. She won the 2011 Dora Mavor Moore Award for Outstanding Female Performance, along with a nomination for Outstanding Production, a nod to her multi-talents in her craft. I've never been happier than I was with her interpretation of the role.</p>
<p>I wrote the leading role in The Nun's Vacation for Sandy and she impressed me once again to such a degree that I am now writing a part in my new play specifically for her.</p>
<p>Sandy is among the best actresses I’ve ever seen and I know that she can do no wrong with anything she touches."" - Tom Walmsley</p>

""I figured Hollywood would be this place of dreams. Beauty and dreams. But it wasn’t like that. You couldn’t trust a goddamned soul. I had a boss who constantly tried to fuck me. No, no I mean, you know steal money from my tip jar, beat me out of a couple hours on my check. And an agent who, I think, had his eyes on the perfect body. They all seemed to be stroking you and fucking you at the same time. Sort of the worst kind of lover, the kind you can’t trust.

Sandy Duarte is the Winner of the prestigious Dora Mavor Moore Award [Canada's Tony Award] for her Outstanding Female Performance in the iconic production of Blood written by Tom Walmsley.

We're a collective of established theatre artists working under the name Below the Salt Theatre. Directed by Ken Schwartz, the stellar award-winning cast includes Jackie Torrens as Hamlet, Stephanie MacDonald as Queen Gertrude, Christian Murray as Rosencrantz & Guildenstern, Andrea Lee Norwood as Laertes, Marty Burt as Claudius and Micha Cromwell as Horatio. 

What We Need & What You Get
We've worked really hard for the last 2 years, raising money for this unique production of Hamlet. We've been fortunate to receive Canada Council and Arts NS money but we still need 8500.00 to help us stage this production the way we envision it. Funds raised will help us cover show expenses such as costumes, specialty props & set pieces, design & box office personnel.
But we need you! And we're willing to send you rewards for your help - please check out our Perks! We can also issue you tax receipts through Theatre Nova Scotia, our provincial organization that serves  professional theatre in Nova Scotia. 
FAQs about Our Campaign:
Can I get a tax receipt?
Yes! If you claim a reward, you can get a partial tax receipt. If you don't claim a reward, you can get a full tax receipt. We will need your full address, name and contact information in order to provide this. Theatre Nova Scotia will be issuing the receipt.
When can I get my rewards? 
We will be sending out rewards in April 2018. In the case of donors purchasing the private show, we will be in contact long before this to arrange dates for end of April 2018.
What if I don't want a reward, I just want to give you some money?
That's no problem. Just click on the ""Back It"" button, add the amount and select ""No Reward""
Can I increase my donation, once it's been made?
Yes! Just send a quick note to us at HalifaxHamlet@gmail.com and we'll take care of this on our end.
Can I give someone else my reward? 
Yes, O Saintly One! For billing purposes, make the donation in your name but send us a quick note at HalifaxHamlet@gmail.com letting us know who you would like to receive your reward and we'll take care of it!
What happens if for some reason the project does not occur?

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>A group of multicultural women actors who have come together to present an original play that challenges Hollywood expectations &amp; stereotypes.

<h2>WHO ARE WE (AP&amp;A)</h2>
<p><a href=""https://www.andreapena.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Andrea Peña &amp; Artists</a> is a Montreal based contemporary dance company known for their vigorous engagement between the physical body and the conscious individual self. Andrea Peña has collaborated with celebrated performers, visual artists and filmmakers in Canada, Europe, and the United States. Peña and her company, have been recognized with numerous awards and commissions, for their visceral and highly rigorous creations, including a recent award at the Hong Kong International Choreography Festival for best choreography. Andrea Peña &amp; Artists tours extensively around the world to Asia, Latin America, Europe, and Canada with productions that include UNTITLED I (2018), ZERO UNO UNO ZERO (2017),  KAIROS (2015), and VIUN (2014). The company focuses on developing alternative multi-disciplinary universes that rupture out notions of a sensible humanity, transformed as large ensemble installations that are experienced viscerally by the spectator. Difficult choreography that is highly intricate, vulnerable and raw, extending beyond mere movement.</p>
<p><i>""Peña holds a surprising and unpredictable artistic signature that reveals a new female discourse of contemporary... a language and a universe of astounding intelligence, and the shaping of an unusual and unique atmosphere.

<p>5 danseurs | 1 chanteuse d’opéra | 1 DJ en direct | 1 concepteur d’éclairage | 2 costumes designers</p>
<p><strong>Nous souhaitons collecter 10 000 $ avant notre départ, le 2 décembre 2018, au Banff Arts Centre pour une résidence de création magique.</strong> Le montant collecté couvrira les frais de billets d’avion et les frais d’artistes impliqués dans le projet. Avec votre soutien, nous aurons l’occasion de participer à l’une des résidences artistiques les plus réputées au Canada.</p>
<p>Après une résidence créative avec les prestigieux présentateurs internationaux DanseDanse, 6.58 (nouvelle création) entrera dans ses dernières étapes de transformation pour passer à la production finale, prête pour la tournée et la scène. Le célèbre Banff Arts Centre du Canada a invité AP&amp;A dans ses studios de création pour finaliser la création de cet univers performatif sauvage. C’est la première fois que la société se lance dans une création d’une telle envergure avec un large éventail de disciplines et d’artistes créatifs divers.</p>
<p>Nous prévoyons de faire quelque chose d’avant-gardiste, multidisciplinaire, futuriste, honnête, humain et surréel. MAIS nous ne pouvons pas vous en dire plus, parce que ça doit vous surprendre quand vous le voyez en direct. Faites-nous confiance!</p>
<p><strong>Contribuez à la création multimédia créée par l’une des meilleures compagnies de danse contemporaine montréalaise</strong></p>
<p>Andrea Peña &amp; Artists se lance dans une nouvelle création multidisciplinaire et nous avons besoin de votre soutien pour participer au prestigieux BANFF ARTS CENTER.

<h2>QUI SOMMES-NOUS (AP&amp;A)</h2>
<p>Andrea Peña &amp; Artists est une compagnie de danse contemporaine basée à Montréal reconnue pour son engagement vigoureux entre le corps physique et le moi conscient. Andrea Peña a collaboré avec des interprètes, des artistes visuels et des cinéastes de renom au Canada, en Europe et aux États-Unis. Peña et sa compagnie ont été récompensés par de nombreuses récompenses et commandes pour leurs créations viscérales et extrêmement rigoureuses, dont un récent prix au Festival international de chorégraphie de Hong Kong pour la meilleure chorégraphie. Andrea Peña &amp; Artists effectue de nombreuses tournées à travers le monde en Asie, en Amérique latine, en Europe et au Canada, notamment avec UNTITLED I (2018), ZERO UNO UNO ZERO (2017), KAIROS (2015) et VIUN (2014). L’organisme se concentre sur le développement d’univers multidisciplinaires alternatifs qui brisent les notions d’humanité sensible transformées en grandes installations d’ensemble vécues viscéralement par le spectateur. Une chorégraphie difficile, extrêmement complexe, vulnérable et crue, qui dépasse le simple mouvement.</p>
<p><i>« Peña possède une signature artistique surprenante et imprévisible qui révèle un nouveau discours féminin contemporain... un langage et un univers d’intelligence étonnante, ainsi que la formation d’une atmosphère inhabituelle et unique. La vérité de cette chorégraphe et du monde qui suit respire une belle grande force de conscience humaine ».</i></p>

</div></div>","Andrea Peña & Artists' NEW CREATION!
5 dancers | 1 opera signer |  1 live DJ |  1 lighting designer | 2 costume designers
We are looking to raise $10,000 before our travel departure Dec 2nd 2018 to the Banff Arts Center for an intensive creative residency. The amount collected will cover expenses for airline tickets and the artists' fees involved in the project. With your support, we will have the opportunity to participate in one of the most renowned artistic residencies in Canada. 
After a creative residency with prestigious international presenters DanseDanse, 6.58 (New creation) will be entering its final stages towards a final production ready for touring and stage. Canada's renowned Banff Arts Centre has invited AP&A into their creative studios to finalize the creation of this wild performative universe. This is the first time the company is embarking on such a vast creation with a large set of creatively diverse disciplines and artists. 
We plan on making something avant garde, multi-disciplinary, futuristic, honest, human and surreal. BUT we can't tell you any more than that, because it's gotta be a surprise for when you see it live. Trust us.

Andrea Peña & Artists NOUVELLE CRÉATION au Banff Arts Centre
5 danseurs | 1 chanteuse d’opéra | 1 DJ en direct | 1 concepteur d’éclairage | 2 costumes designers
Nous souhaitons collecter 10 000 $ avant notre départ, le 2 décembre 2018, au Banff Arts Centre pour une résidence de création magique. Le montant collecté couvrira les frais de billets d’avion et les frais d’artistes impliqués dans le projet. Avec votre soutien, nous aurons l’occasion de participer à l’une des résidences artistiques les plus réputées au Canada.
Après une résidence créative avec les prestigieux présentateurs internationaux DanseDanse, 6.58 (nouvelle création) entrera dans ses dernières étapes de transformation pour passer à la production finale, prête pour la tournée et la scène. Le célèbre Banff Arts Centre du Canada a invité AP&A dans ses studios de création pour finaliser la création de cet univers performatif sauvage. C’est la première fois que la société se lance dans une création d’une telle envergure avec un large éventail de disciplines et d’artistes créatifs divers.
Nous prévoyons de faire quelque chose d’avant-gardiste, multidisciplinaire, futuriste, honnête, humain et surréel. MAIS nous ne pouvons pas vous en dire plus, parce que ça doit vous surprendre quand vous le voyez en direct. Faites-nous confiance!

<h3>The Money Stuff</h3>
<p>It's really important to us to be fully transparent in this project. This is a collaborative effort to make a mark on society -- and we want you to be as involved in that process as possible. Unfortunately, we can't do it on our own -- so here's the breakdown of where your support would go: </p>
<ul>
<li>We're currently seeking roughly £5,000 in total.</li>
<li>This would go to paying performers, paying for travel and accommodation for the team, as well as paying for equipment and any other necessities. We sincerely believe that everyone should get paid for the work that they do as artists, and with a higher budget we could ensure more diversity with our performers and a bigger team, rather than having to essentially put this entire show on ourselves. </li>
<li>If we don't make our goal, the show will still be extremely limited to the scope, number of performers, diversity, longevity, and over all impact of the project. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Let's Make a Difference Together</h3>
<p>We would love to take this project much farther than the two scheduled performances we have right now. Some of our long term goals include: </p>
<ul>
<li>Turning the production into a national or even global educational theatre tour. </li>
<li>Transforming the production into a short film or even web-series focused on balancing education with entertainment. </li>
<li>Creating a compelling social media campaign of awareness for the dangers of mental illness in the LGBTQ+ community, where support can be found, and what we can do as a society to make meaningful change. </li>
</ul>
</div><div><p>Right now our biggest limitation is, truly, funding. We have the drive to make these dreams a reality, but both Izzy and Bradley have day jobs they have to work to pay the bills and rent. If we could get enough funding we could commit fully to this project and the impact it could have.</p></div><div>
<h3>Get Involved In Other Ways! </h3>
<p>We know that not everyone can afford to help, and we would love to still have you involved in this movement! Here's how you can get involved: </p>
<ul>
<li>Share this campaign on your social media, and encourage those around you to donate. </li>
<li>Get involved on social media, tweet us, make posts about the production, share our social media posts, and just generally make a lot of noise surrounding LGBT+ mental health! </li>

<h2>About us and the project...</h2>
<p><strong>pluck.</strong> make theatre.  They make slick, exciting, ruddy good theatre, because they got tired of waiting for other people to do it for them and tired of waiting for the phone to ring. ​</p>
<p>They decided to take matters into their own hands. To stop making excuses and start making work. So one plucky actress rang one plucky actor, and pluck. was formed.  </p>
<p>To date, pluck. have produced four full-scale shows and numerous new writing nights. Their most recent project was<i> BIRTHDAY SUIT</i> by David K. Barnes, which had a critically acclaimed run at the Old Red Lion in 2017 and was nominated for three <strong>OFFIE</strong> awards including <strong>Best New Play. </strong></p>
<p><i>Alkaline</i> is our biggest, most ambitious and most topical production to date. It's a complex and provocative play from an exciting talent. It poses difficult questions, challenges audience's preconceptions and allegiances, and introduces the world to five brand new and remarkable characters.</p>
<p><i>'People love being in control, don't you think? But you can't control something you don't understand.' </i></p>
<p><i>Sophie and Sarah have been best friends forever. Sophie is newly engaged to her fiancé Nick and wants to celebrate. Sarah also has a new fiancé, Ali, and some more big news – she has recently converted to Islam.</i></p>
<p><i>One hot summer evening the two couples have a get together. Sophie is desperate to meet Ali and even more desperate to rescue her drifting friendship with Sarah. Sophie also wants to ask Sarah if she’ll take off her hijab for Sophie’s wedding - a headscarf ‘just won’t quite go’ with the other bridesmaids, and Sophie likes things to match. It’s all going well (ish) until an uninvited guest arrives with some news that turns the evening – and the couples’ lives - upside down.</i></p>
<h3>What we need &amp; what will that do?</h3>
<p>With each production we have mounted, we have endeavoured to raise the stakes and the production values. In just four years, in this notoriously competitive, cut-throat and underfunded industry, we are now bringing a show to a venue with a profile and prestige that we could never have dreamed of back in 2014. </p>
<p>But with this ambitious new platform and level of exposure and ambition come ever-increasing costs. The list of necessary line items in the budget is quite frankly terrifying, and includes (but is by no means limited to): actors' fees, creative team fees, venue hire costs, rehearsal space costs, set construction materials and build costs, props and costumes, equipment hire, the design and printing of promotional materials, a marketing campaign, a PR representative, online advertising - the list goes on.  </p>
<p>To help cover all of the above and more, we are looking for your help to reach our funding goal of £5,000 - which is still only a small percentage of our overall production cost. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><i>Alkaline</i> hopes to speak to a community on the doorstep of the theatre that have not always seen themselves represented on their local stage. The piece aims to disrupt stereotypes, challenge audience's preconceptions and turn their normal allegiances on their head, holding a mirror up to self-professed liberalism to interrogate whether it sometimes only goes skin deep. </p>
<p>Our track record of darkly comic plays is proven. Our previous production of <i>BIRTHDAY SUIT </i>was a huge success, playing to packed houses and great critical reception - and three OFFIE nominations! </p>
<p>The impact of bringing <i>Alkaline</i> to the London stage will filter down to a younger generation of theatre makers, too. We started as two friends with a dream in a beer garden four years ago, and now we are here (and still sometimes in beer gardens). With each period of pluck's growth, we look to other production companies and theatre makers for inspiration and guidance. And in turn, we have seen numerous young graduates and actors who want to take the leap into producing seek us out for advice, which is a fantastic way to foster young talent. We like to think that we are proof that sometimes you can make your own luck - with lots of hard work and determination! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This isn't our first time at the rodeo and, of course, we have weathered many a storm to be where we are today. We've lost out on pitches, been denied numerous funding applications, venues have broken equipment that we'd secured use of as a favour, a key item of set once didn't arrive before press night - we have faced every possible logistical and creative challenge along the way in a production process. We've had to become pretty good at innovative and spontaneous problem-solving! All the knowledge we have gained in this field is through hard-won experience. </p>
<p>There's absolutely nothing unnecessary in our hefty production budget, and we are responsible for being able to honour the financial commitments we have made to everyone involved, which is no small obligation, and one that we take very seriously. Many projects even at this level would still be profit-share, as so many London theatre companies working on the fringe still seem to treat actors as the least important piece of the puzzle. We are paying everyone involved at every level for their time and their talent, and that is something that we are very proud of.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You may not be able to contribute to our fund here and that's fine; there's loads of other ways you can help....</p>

Alkaline is our biggest, most ambitious and most topical production to date. It's a complex and provocative play from an exciting talent. It poses difficult questions, challenges audience's preconceptions and allegiances, and introduces the world to five brand new and remarkable characters.
'People love being in control, don't you think? But you can't control something you don't understand.' 
Sophie and Sarah have been best friends forever. Sophie is newly engaged to her fiancé Nick and wants to celebrate. Sarah also has a new fiancé, Ali, and some more big news – she has recently converted to Islam.
One hot summer evening the two couples have a get together. Sophie is desperate to meet Ali and even more desperate to rescue her drifting friendship with Sarah. Sophie also wants to ask Sarah if she’ll take off her hijab for Sophie’s wedding - a headscarf ‘just won’t quite go’ with the other bridesmaids, and Sophie likes things to match. It’s all going well (ish) until an uninvited guest arrives with some news that turns the evening – and the couples’ lives - upside down.
What we need & what will that do?
With each production we have mounted, we have endeavoured to raise the stakes and the production values. In just four years, in this notoriously competitive, cut-throat and underfunded industry, we are now bringing a show to a venue with a profile and prestige that we could never have dreamed of back in 2014. 
But with this ambitious new platform and level of exposure and ambition come ever-increasing costs. The list of necessary line items in the budget is quite frankly terrifying, and includes (but is by no means limited to): actors' fees, creative team fees, venue hire costs, rehearsal space costs, set construction materials and build costs, props and costumes, equipment hire, the design and printing of promotional materials, a marketing campaign, a PR representative, online advertising - the list goes on.  
To help cover all of the above and more, we are looking for your help to reach our funding goal of £5,000 - which is still only a small percentage of our overall production cost. 

The Impact
Alkaline hopes to speak to a community on the doorstep of the theatre that have not always seen themselves represented on their local stage. The piece aims to disrupt stereotypes, challenge audience's preconceptions and turn their normal allegiances on their head, holding a mirror up to self-professed liberalism to interrogate whether it sometimes only goes skin deep. 
Our track record of darkly comic plays is proven. Our previous production of BIRTHDAY SUIT was a huge success, playing to packed houses and great critical reception - and three OFFIE nominations! 
The impact of bringing Alkaline to the London stage will filter down to a younger generation of theatre makers, too. We started as two friends with a dream in a beer garden four years ago, and now we are here (and still sometimes in beer gardens). With each period of pluck's growth, we look to other production companies and theatre makers for inspiration and guidance. And in turn, we have seen numerous young graduates and actors who want to take the leap into producing seek us out for advice, which is a fantastic way to foster young talent. We like to think that we are proof that sometimes you can make your own luck - with lots of hard work and determination! 

Risks & Challenges
This isn't our first time at the rodeo and, of course, we have weathered many a storm to be where we are today. We've lost out on pitches, been denied numerous funding applications, venues have broken equipment that we'd secured use of as a favour, a key item of set once didn't arrive before press night - we have faced every possible logistical and creative challenge along the way in a production process. We've had to become pretty good at innovative and spontaneous problem-solving! All the knowledge we have gained in this field is through hard-won experience. 
There's absolutely nothing unnecessary in our hefty production budget, and we are responsible for being able to honour the financial commitments we have made to everyone involved, which is no small obligation, and one that we take very seriously. Many projects even at this level would still be profit-share, as so many London theatre companies working on the fringe still seem to treat actors as the least important piece of the puzzle. We are paying everyone involved at every level for their time and their talent, and that is something that we are very proud of.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Between Us Productions is, at it's heart, just a couple of local girls, trying to make theatre that is real and socially relevant. The writer, the actor and every other theatre artist is needed now more than ever to reflect the difficult and challenging choices we make in today's world. </p>
<p>We are thrilled to be able to work with Gary Jaffe on Diaspora, a story of two women, their identities and the messiness that comes with having to reject something in order to embrace something else that feels true to you. </p>
<p>Theatre is, however, expensive. Performance spaces, costumes and lighting cost thousands and thousands of dollars and that doesn't take into account our family of artists donating their time and expertise for free. We want this story to be told on the professional level as it deserves, and we know that with help from you we can do that, as we have done in the past. Every little bit you can give helps these diverse, personal stories shine a little brighter and makes you, yourself a part of the production in a very real sense. </p>

<p>Vanina Arias was born in Switzerland of Italian and Chilean origin. She decided to leave to Paris where she attended courses at Florent School. She discovered the Actor Studio method 2 years later and fell in love with it instantly. She started with “café-théâtre” plays, where interaction with the public is essential. She then went on with other types of plays, often comic duets and was finally hired to play in short programs and TV shows. She got her first English speaking part on stage and performed for one month at the Hollywood Fringe Festival. Two years ago she moved to London and she got a part in the last ""Death Race 4"" with Danny Trejo.

She loves to travel and discover new things. She's fluent in French, Italian, English and Spanish.</p>

<p><u><strong>The Plot</strong></u></p>
<p>A boarding school in the German Democratic Republic, 1983. A teenage girl, abandoned by her parents, finds comfort in the relationship with her teacher, Thomas. But will her brother understand? What will happen if her friend’s illegal activities are discovered by the authorities? And who are the dark figures who visit Thomas at night?</p>
<p><i>Ideology and Hair Gel</i> uses live music, shadow puppetry, stunning movement and fast-paced action to explore themes of misplaced power, vulnerability, homosexuality and femininity.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Who We Are</strong></u></p>
<p>Waspish Theatre Company was set up in 2018 by an all-female creative team, each with a passion to give a voice to the vulnerable. Ideology and Hair Gel, written by Lizzie Corscaden and directed by Bethany-Ann Wilkinson, is Waspish Theatre's first full-length production, and examines the effects of political turmoil on the young and powerless.</p>
<p>The Edinburgh Fringe is the perfect place to showcase this politically-charged piece and launch Waspish Theatre into the spotlight, so that we can continue to give a voice to the unheard.</p>

<h2><strong>Who We Are:</strong></h2>
<p>Theatre EVOLVE is a new company based in Chicago that is focused not only on the type of theatre we create, but the way we create it. Our goal is to be a foothold for emerging artists in the city to develop their skills, resumes, and expand their network. We are doing that by employing a minimum of 50% artists we have never worked with before, including actors, designers, playwrights, or directors with every single production we do.</p>
<p>As we embark on our mission to develop upcoming artists in the Chicago community, we recognize and value the importance of inclusion in our work. We are committed to reflecting the diversity of our nation’s culture at all levels: on our stage, in our audience, and on our staff.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Where We Are Going:</strong></h2>
</div><div>
<p>We are thrilled to fulfill our mission of artistic and professional development by producing a brand new play by Chicago based playwright, Will Coleman! Krugozor! is the story of Svetlana and Vitaly who grow up in the waning days of the Soviet Union, obsessed with Western Rock music, trying to find their place in art, life and government, and reconcile their dreams with reality. Krugozor! brings the real life story of one magazine and its impact on a generation through music and we are thrilled to give it it's world premiere.</p>
<p>Additionally, in our third season we look forward to offering classes between our season's productions. We are working on curricula that develop theatre makers artistically, as well as classes to help with the business side of being a working creative in the city. Resume and audition polishing? Quite possibly! Financial and tax workshops? Hello, I need that.</p>
<p>In listening for what our theatre community here in Chicago is needing developmentally, Theatre EVOLVE is also tuned in to the events of the world as a whole. As we move forward in shaping our season and selecting future shows, we intend to reflect what we hear and learn. We hope you will join us for those conversations and stories in our second season.</p>

</div><div>
<h2><strong>Why This Show Now?</strong></h2>
<p>Krugozor! impresses the idea that music reacts to hardships and enables us to endure them, that it connects us on personal and global levels, and that it facilitates the retelling of our memories. Krugozor! may take place in the Soviet Union, but we feel it's a show that is just as relevant to 2019 America. We are excited to bring that story into the theatre and the hearts of our audience. We hope you are too!</p>

<p>Additionally, we produced our first REvolve reading series! After a month of reading through the 260 play submissions we received from all over the country, we narrowed it down to seven 10-min plays and two full length pieces. With packed houses we were honored to produce REvolve with over 30 actors, playwrights, and directors.</p>
<h3><strong>Season 2</strong></h3>
<p>In the summer of 2019, we produced the World Premiere of Human Resource(s) by Sara Means, telling the sometimes-too-familiar story of corporate America and the extremes of clawing one's way to the top. The production was 'Recommended' by critics and left audiences aghast!</p>

<p>Where or When is a play about heart, and how everyone has their own story. Written by Jonathan Ewing and Erica Toews, they created this story out of personal experiences that we have all had to deal with in our lives. Loss, disappointment, and fear of change. This is a story that deserves to be told. Together with Infinite Imagination Traveling Theatre and Typecast Anonymous Productions, you can make that happen. In the midst of a global pandemic, life has been tough for everyone, including artists. Artists have always built a community around support, love, and understanding. However, those doors have been shut for almost a year now. We wish to change this, while still doing our part to limit the spread of COVID-19. The fundraising goal behind this project is to create an experience and film the production so it can be a continued source of inspiration to artists in the community.  Families and individuals will be able to rent the production and forget about the troubles in their lives... if only for a night. While we think it is important to tell the story of Where or When, we want to do it the right way. That's why we are asking for a fundraising goal of 4,000 dollars. The money will go to the cost of filming, sets, costumes and venue rental. In our updates we will provide a breakdown of where each dollar is spent. Our vision is that it will feel as if you were in the theatre yourselves. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our number one risk is COVID-19. With the real burden of restrictions and lockdowns, it not only takes a financial toll but also an emotional one. Our goal is to produce this show at the end of March. However, we understand that this may not be possible. Regardless, we will commit to producing this production as soon as possible with a team dedicated to seeing this play to completion. For this project, we have chosen flexible funding because we will produce this show regardless of the funds we receive. However, if we are able to reach our goal (Or beyond), that will allow us to create this show without the worry of financial burden and we can focus on telling a story that deserves to see the limelight. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Hope, I am the Artistic Director of CUBE Ensemble and the Composer of Faces of Eurydice. This new Dance-Opera-Theater work was born out of a desire to make a new genre of Opera that would absorb the best of the best in new dance, music and theater!</p>
<p>I found our Choreographic Director, Hope Goldman, at a showing of process pieces that she presented back in the summer of 2013 and knew right then and there that I wanted to work with her. Her choreography is the most exciting dance I have seen in Chicago. It is daring, theatrical, and explores sides of femininity that are not often portrayed in theater.</p>
<p>Our totally badass performers: Lia, Vienna, Beth, Alex, Allison, Kroy and Jeremy are classically trained in music, dance and theater and with them we have devised a piece of incredible magnitude.  Faces of Eurydice is sharp, lush, expansive, heart wrenching and truly one of a kind. </p>
<p> With your help we can cover the costs of a black box theater and the high quality promotion necessary to share this labor of love (a year and a half in the making) with Chicago! We will also be able to pay our performers and design team a stipend for all of their incredible work! </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Id like to share a fable with you</p>
<p>(sparknotes version: you, dear donor, are a hero to a young generation of innovative artists)</p>
<p>A recently graduated Opera/Music Composition student with a background in classical dance and music theater is thrust into the professional world where she soon discovers a lack of work that she feels represents her generation/anything that has happened in the last 100 years... She loves opera but usually falls asleep when she goes to see it. She wants to latch on to a theatrical heroine in said genre, but they are usually sickly/insane/heartless killers...Great...</p>
<p> She often plays jams sessions with her incredibly talented musician friends around Chicago who absorb ALL OF THE STYLES: pop, jazz, classical, folk, rock, blues, punk, electronic, you name it.. These friends wish they could find a way to collaborate with theatre but they believe theater people only want ""music theater"" and they would prefer to have a little more freedom/sophistication than their understanding of said genre.</p>
<p>She also goes to see dance companies around the city and is sad, so. so. so. sad to see them performing these new beautiful creations to...recordings...yes, friends, canned music. Played off their ipods. ~tear~ Truly they deserve more than this...and I know just the people to give it to them. </p>
<p>This wee composer begins to build a group of performers spanning the three genres that have high skill on their respective instruments, an ability to work in both abstract and narrative exercises and have top notch improvissational skills with which to build a new language/genre of music theater. </p>
<p>Together they spend a year and a half developing a new language as they bring new level of sophistication to Music Theater that it has been generally lacking. They call it Dance Opera Theater and it has changed their worlds, blown their minds! They say things like ""We really do have a place and a voice in this genre!"" and ""What we love and care about can be absorbed into said genre and shared in Theaters around the world!"" </p>
<p>This group of talented, hard working, determined artists paradigm-shifted (words are invented, not discovered) not only their own perspective but the perspective of many a young, hungry recent music/theater/dance graduates searching for their voice. They are all filled with hope and humbled in deep gratitude for the group of devoted collaborators who donated funds to make such work possible! Because of this enthusiasm and support they now believe that if they work hard to make new, excellently crafted, relevant work in their genuine voice, a group of incredible, generous, artists/activists/community leaders will support these efforts! <br/></p>

</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In the world of <i>Crashlight</i>, tens of millions of people in a
dystopian/Orwell-esque future have only three minutes of sunlight a day. This
small amount of light is controlled by a fascist dictator, Marcus Pressi; a
master of propaganda, a master of power and control by censorship. Rian, an
illegal violin maker in the dark leaves her home and two sisters after
discovering that ""someone in the sky hides the light away."" With
courage, she disguises herself as the enemy in an attempt to reveal a beautiful
freedom to those who don't even know one exists. Her original story and never
before heard music expresses our capacity as people to desire truth and the divine
power of communication through music.</p>

PeachPie Productions was founded in San Francisco in 2013 by
NYU graduate, Celeste Makoff. The production company’s most recent show, Bottled
Up, went up in Manhattan last summer, 2015 at the DCTV Center in TriBeCa.
PeachPie Productions has sold out every performance and each production has
brought in new vital members to its creative team. All of our production team members have graduated
in the past eight years from several prestigious universities and conservatories.

Mission Statement



PeachPie's mission is to give specifically new artists the
framework to exercise their talents in order to gain the experience they need
to take on a career in the arts.

About the Show


In the world of Crashlight, tens of millions of people in a
dystopian/Orwell-esque future have only three minutes of sunlight a day. This
small amount of light is controlled by a fascist dictator, Marcus Pressi; a
master of propaganda, a master of power and control by censorship. Rian, an
illegal violin maker in the dark leaves her home and two sisters after
discovering that ""someone in the sky hides the light away."" With
courage, she disguises herself as the enemy in an attempt to reveal a beautiful
freedom to those who don't even know one exists. Her original story and never
before heard music expresses our capacity as people to desire truth and the divine
power of communication through music.

<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>We are two NYC based actors, Ramiq Harris and Bryan Hamilton. Both having worked in the theatre for the last few years; <i>Henry V, Double ""I"", Stage Beauty </i>( Ramiq Harris ). <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, <i>Golden Boy, Land of Broken Toys </i>( Bryan Hamilton ).</li>
<li>Our campaign is to raise funds for the play, Guards at the Taj, written by Rajiv Joseph. The production will go up at the Times Square Arts Center- John Desotelle Studio ( 300 W 43rd Street, NY, NY 10036, 3rd floor ), on September 8th - 10th ( <i>Thursday - Saturday,</i> 7:30PM ), and September 11th ( <i>Sunday</i> - 7:00PM ).</li>
</ul>
<p>               We started this journey in a very unique fashion. The two of us are a part of an unofficial theatre group that trains with Master Acting teacher, Richard Pinter, on a consistent basis. The goal of our training is training itself, however, the two of us wanted to explore moving from scenes to full length plays. We started working on Guards, completely by ourselves at first, with no intention of putting it up for the public. We both absolutely fell in love this play and we met in different parks and studios to rehearse everyday, despite our busy schedules. Eventually, we brought in our work and workshopped it with our theatre group. We have received encouragement from our fellow peers to put up this show and both have a strong desire to share our work and challenge ourselves further. We have faith in what we're doing and we have faith in the fact that Theatre, at its highest level, is an art form that can serve humanity like no other.  Putting ourselves out there and playing this play for the audience is something we feel is essential for our growth as actors.

<h3>Hello,</h3>
<p><strong>Oxen|free|theatre</strong> is committed to telling great stories simply, honestly and beautifully.  A compelling piece of theatre is the result of not just the actors, or even the director, but an entire team of people unified by a single objective: to create a vivid, exciting, and complete world into which an audience can enter for the purposes of community, entertainment and enlightenment. Our designers, producers, production managers, stage managers and directors all work together from the inception of the project to help create a single and cohesive vision that is greater than the sum of its parts.  Taste is subjective, quality is not.  We are committed to producing theatre of the highest calibre. </p>
<p>In the <i><strong>Spring of 2017</strong></i> we'll be mounting the Canadian Premiere of Sarah Ruhl's stunning and hilarious modern odyssey, <i><strong>""Dead Man's Cell Phone</strong></i>"".  The play is a tragicomic exploration of our need for connection and intimacy in the modern world.  Not only is the play of the utmost relevance to today's audience, it is also the perfect embodiment of the values our company hopes to cultivate in our work.  It places high demands on everyone involved; the space, the designers, the technicians, director, and the actors.  It's big and bold and cannot be done without your support.</p>
<p>With your help we'll be able give this play the production it demands and in turn give the community the quality of performance they so deserve.  </p>
<p><strong>CAST</strong>: Liisa Repo-Martell, Gregory Prest, Ryan Hollyman, and Tennille Read (further casting announcements to be revealed)</p>
<p><strong>Director</strong>: Justin Goodhand</p>
<p><strong>Producer</strong>: Laura Paduch</p>
<p><strong>Costumes</strong>: Lindsay Dagger Junkin</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>The costs of making theatre in a city like Toronto are substantial.  We are not deterred by this.  In order to create the standard of work we believe is required, we're working with a budget of more than <strong>$50,000.00</strong>.  This money goes towards renting the theatre venue, rehearsal space, material costs, marketing costs, and money for all of the artists involved who are giving their time and skill to the production. Though we need these funds, we're not asking you for all of them.  We've been hard at work seeking corporate sponsorships, government grants, and every other available source of funding.  </p>
<p>In exchange for your support we have some very exciting and unique perks.  If you donate, not only will you be giving a huge gift to us, but to the Canadian arts community as well; theatre makers and audiences alike.  That being said, we want to express our gratitude in other ways. Depending on the level of contribution, we're offering a variety of <strong>perks</strong> such as <i>original design sketches, framed set renderings, invited dress rehearsals, hand written thank-you notes on the stationary in the show, and dinner with the director and cast</i>.  Not enough?  How about we'll <i>put your name in the show</i>, said live on the night of your choosing?  How about you <i>leave us a voicemail message and we'll play in the show</i>?  Or maybe you'd like <i>one of the hand-made blue raincoats</i> you'll see swishing across the stage.  All of these things are for you.  On top of that, we will sing your praises from the rooftops on social media and even in our program.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our funding goals, things will inevitably have to be scaled down. Our goals are not based on a fantasy, but truly on what we feel we need to do this thing right.  If we come up short we will downsize, but only to a point. The money we hope to pay the artists working tirelessly will go down. And finally there will be a point where the show will not happen at all should the money not be there, because we feel it would be better not to do the show at all than to do it poorly. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help!</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<p>We understand not everyone is in a position to give money.  That doesn't mean you can't help us out!  If you do nothing us, please share our campaign with as many people as you can.  You never know who might be interested.  </p>
<p>Help us get our social media buzz going by following us on <strong>Twitter</strong> @oxenfreetheatre , on <strong>Instagram</strong> @oxen_free_theatre , or follow us on <strong>Facebook </strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/oxenfreetheatre"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/oxenfreetheatre</a></p>

Other Ways You Can Help!
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:
We understand not everyone is in a position to give money.  That doesn't mean you can't help us out!  If you do nothing us, please share our campaign with as many people as you can.  You never know who might be interested.  
Help us get our social media buzz going by following us on Twitter @oxenfreetheatre , on Instagram @oxen_free_theatre , or follow us on Facebook https://www.facebook.com/oxenfreetheatre
At the end of the day, if you do all, any, or none of these things for us, we hope you'll join us at the Tarragon Theatre in May for what is sure to be a night of thrilling theatre.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Taking The Dwelling Place To The Fringe</h3>
<p>Our project to take The Dwelling Place to the Fringe is the culmination of three years of developing and creating an art work that is deeply important to us. The ideas and vision of the project come from a heartfelt desire to give audiences a captivating and unconventional theatre experience. The mysterious world of the abandoned house we discovered is one that has deep resonance and insight in to our universal condition. </p>
<p>We invite audiences in to this world, to make it tangible, to be able to reach out and feel it all around you.  We draw on all of our creative skills and love of the live experience by innovating with the latest technology available in digital art and sound, while mixing it with our years of professional experience in theatre, film and music. </p>
<p>After many years of dedicated work as artists, we have the a special chance to bring our own original work to the best venue available, taking our artistic careers to a whole new level. </p>

Lewis has always been passionate about the moving image and narrative storytelling and is always looking for ways to experiment in the medium.</p>
<p><strong>Together </strong>they experiment in film, music and theatre  </p>
<h3>What we need funding to support?</h3>
<p>We are presenting the show on a DIY and self funded basis. Any money we receive will be going on costs and expenses that are for essential for the project. Every penny will help us on our way.</p>
<p><u>Our main production costs are:</u></p>
<ul>
<li>Van Hire to transport equipment and set </li>
<li>Venue Hire and Fringe Registration Costs</li>
<li>Public Transport for Artists</li>
<li>Health and Safety - making sure our equipment meets British standards and the space is safe for audiences. -  (PAT Testing, Fire safety and cabling concealment)</li>
<li> Materials for the set design, including props, fabric and costume. </li>
<li>Printing of marketing materials - flyers, posters and online</li>
<li>Hire or purchasing costs for key lighting, sound and projection equipment. </li>
<li>Essential production consumables</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We are prioritising these costs over paying ourselves for our time on the production.</p>
<p>We would love to able to offer more perks and rewards for the contributions we receive, however the nature of the performance and The Fringe strictly limits the number of tickets we can give away. If we can help you out with your projects or in the future we would love to hear from you.

<p><u><strong>About the Production</strong></u></p>
<p>Music and hearts are beating, and as the love stories are played out, a seemingly harmless prank goes horribly wrong resulting in a tragic fall from grace. </p>
<p> Our Twelfth Night is a direct response to our last show, Hamlet. As a company we have been immersed in expressing grief and trauma for the last two years and have now turned our creative forces toward love, music and romance. We finished Hamlet with the ghost of the drowned Ophelia speaking her own narrative to her brother, ‘I am drowned Laertes’. We begin Twelfth Night with the near drowned Viola as if picking up directly from where we left off. With the same actors - Francesca Zoutewelle and Finlay Cormack  - again playing brother and sister we are exploring, as Shakespeare did, where a narrative of courage and hope can lead us as the twins are reunited at the end of the play.</p>
<p><i>“The play seems as we read it to tremble perpetually on the brink of music” Virginia Woolf </i></p>
<p>The show is performed by six young actors, who play all the music; they never leave the stage. Our tale explores love’s madness and our deep human need for music, whilst catching transgender inclinations, emotional transgressions and impossibly romantic reunions.</p>
<p><i>""Prove true, imagination oh prove true"" Viola Act 3 sc 4</i></p>
<p>With nothing but benches to sit on, instruments to play and costumes and props that may have been washed up on a beach, the actors create an authentic, funny and moving experience for a 21st Century audience.</p>

Our Director is inspired by the work of Alexander McQueen, Andy Warhol and Stanley Kubrick, and with a talented production team with an eclectic mix of experience, we hope to bring you this story of survival, violence and human contact with a unique visual style.  It's a little bit weird, and a whole lot of wonderful!   </p><h3>""Ok, So What Exactly Is The Project?""</h3><p>Our project consists of a 2 week professional run of <i>Thirst</i> at the Space theatre on the Isle of Dogs, South-East London from the 28th February - 11th March 2017. </p><p>Running parallel to this, the Director will run a series of workshops which will be held at schools in the local community, in order to widen pupil’s engagement with abstract/expressionist theatre.  This will also equip them with new skills in theatre making.</p><p>A debate will be held at the Young Vic on the relationship between ‘art, race and theatre-making, does it matter who is on the driving seat?’.</p><h3>""Great! What Do You Need?""</h3><p>We need £1000 in order to afford:</p><ul>
<li>Costume and props for our beloved actors.  We want the play to feel as authentic as possible, and we are sure they would be grateful to be clothed during the production! </li>
<li>A Lighting Designer.  We feel that light has a very important part to play in the production in order to give it the perfect atmosphere.  How will you know what is happening if it is in the dark! </li>
<li>A Producer.  We want the play to reach the ears of as many people as possible, and a marketing whizz is the perfect person to do this!  </li>
<li>And lastly, Rehearsal Space!</li>

Our Director is inspired by the work of Alexander McQueen, Andy Warhol and Stanley Kubrick, and with a talented production team with an eclectic mix of experience, we hope to bring you this story of survival, violence and human contact with a unique visual style.  It's a little bit weird, and a whole lot of wonderful!   ""Ok, So What Exactly Is The Project?""Our project consists of a 2 week professional run of Thirst at the Space theatre on the Isle of Dogs, South-East London from the 28th February - 11th March 2017. Running parallel to this, the Director will run a series of workshops which will be held at schools in the local community, in order to widen pupil’s engagement with abstract/expressionist theatre.  This will also equip them with new skills in theatre making.A debate will be held at the Young Vic on the relationship between ‘art, race and theatre-making, does it matter who is on the driving seat?’.""Great! What Do You Need?""We need £1000 in order to afford:
Costume and props for our beloved actors.  We want the play to feel as authentic as possible, and we are sure they would be grateful to be clothed during the production! 
A Lighting Designer.  We feel that light has a very important part to play in the production in order to give it the perfect atmosphere.  How will you know what is happening if it is in the dark! 
A Producer.  We want the play to reach the ears of as many people as possible, and a marketing whizz is the perfect person to do this!  
And lastly, Rehearsal Space!

The Impact
Women's history is key to the continuity of societies.  It's invisibility is a loss for all people.  All people are made curious, grow and are empowered as a result of encountering brave, unique, visionary, female characters.   

Spellbound is the fourth annual production for Dangerous Women.  

We find that young women in high school respond very positively to our annual Dangerous Women presentations, as do audiences of all ages and genders, who learn and grow from experiencing our shows.

The cast's use of the arts is remarkable.  This year will include performances in poetry, visual art, belly dance, rap, drama,  singing, musical instrumentation, giant puppetry, Gregorian chant, hula, and comedy!

<p>For 35 years--through workshops, retreats, classes and productions--we at ANDTheatre Company (aka Artistic New Directions) have developed new theatre pieces. We have a special interest in the intersection of improvisational and scripted theatre. Without-a-Net is one intersection.</p>
<p>For a Without-a-Net production, we give an original five-character play to five directors who, in turn, each cast five different actors. The play is rehearsed separately by each director and cast. Then, over two weeks, we present 25 performances of this one play with a different cast for every performance. At each performance, one actor is called from each of the five companies. The five actors encounter each other for the first time when they meet on stage. While they all have prepared their own characters (they have memorized their lines and understand the relationships to the other characters as written), they encounter the other characters <i>as played</i> anew every time the lights come up. They fly without a net in a performance requiring complete trust. The lines may be set but in all other respects the show is improvised, with discoveries surprising those on either side of the lights.</p>
<p>This production concept was introduced to us by Gary Garrison and Roland Tec when they offered their play <i>The Rubber Room</i> to be produced in this manner. A thought-provoking piece about New York City’s practice of moth-balling public school teachers with disciplinary issues for years at full pay, the show appealed to the theatrical community because of its daring and the educational community because of its provocative subject matter. Two years later, we offered Kristine Niven’s <i>Human Resources, </i>a bittersweet look at white collar workers in a shrinking employment market, and two years after that <i>Café Pen</i>, set in a small town with an economy based on the local federal penitentiary, the script explored a community of characters who live outside the prison walls but whose lives are linked to those serving on the inside.</p>
<p><i>Human Resources</i> and <i>Café Pen</i> were both developed through another of ANDTheatre’s programs, the annual Summer Salt Playprov Retreat, where the playwright researched the characters and their encounters through a series of guided improvisations. The scripts continued to be developed through AND-sponsored readings and workshops. Their presentation as a Without-a-Net project is a fulfillment of the company’s mission to generate, revise, and polish a piece till it’s ready for a public audience.</p>
<p>Our 2017 Without-a-Net script has been developed as described above, through the programs of ANDTheatre Company.  <i>Buried in Time</i>, written by Kristine Niven,  tells the story of  what happens when Charlotte Donohue, a woman who has made her mark in New York City,  returns home to Guthrie, PA, population 6000, for the funeral of her father. She meets her high school/college boyfriend, his niece, and a childhood mentor. Along with Charlotte's brother, they prepare for the funeral. As they prepare for the funeral, we discover everyone has something to bury, put to rest, or uncover. </p>
<p>Without-a-Net is a huge project for our little company. With 25 actors, five directors, five stage managers, plus the talents of set, lighting and costuming designers, our budget needs help. The complete budget is below. We are hoping to raise $7,500 towards it. Box office receipts are projected to bring in $5000-6000 (tickets are priced between $10 and $18, and as an Equity production, we are required to comp Equity actors and industry people, e.g. casting directors, agents, producers, directors). The balance will come from a recent benefit and our general funds. The company is determined to present this project. Your support will help move intention to realization.</p>

  Vincent Terrell Durham and Alton J. Patton III.It’s the summer of 1958.  Mrs. Sarah Woods has been visiting colored families in the small rural North Carolina community.  Armed with her eugenics board questionnaire, she has been doling out sterilization orders to families of the afflicted.  Already ashamed of having imperfect children and impaired family members, the targeted households keep their new misery a tightly held secret.  Mama Cora is the latest to receive an appointment notice from Mrs. Woods.  The sixty-four-year-old woman has no idea what a white social worker from the government would need to see her about.  But being a colored woman of the south, she knows the visit is a call for caution.The Fertile River made its West Coast premiere on November 15, 2015.  The piece was presented as an exclusive one-time stage reading at The Actor's Company in Hollywood, CA.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Gloria Bacon. I am a dancer, choreographer and the organizer of the International Modern Dance Festival in Nicaragua.  I have been promoting modern dance in my country for over 30 years. </p>
<p>As a dancer in Nicaragua I see and live the limitations of being an artist in Central America.  Little funding to produce new work, to travel and to attend workshops.  To grow as an artist and encourage new generators of dancers to push the boundaries, I found the need to bring the international modern dance movement home. </p>
<p>I created the festival with the purpose to offer my students and the dance community in Nicaragua an opportunity to see and exchange ideas with dancers from all over the world.</p>
<p>For 22 years this festival has offered nicaraguan and international dancers a space to exchange ideas and make long lasting relationships. This year we will celebrate the 23rd edition of the International Dance Festival and we are expecting groups from Germany, Sweden, Spain, Mexico, Canada, Paraguay and Central America.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With the money we raise through this fundraising campaign we will cover the cost of lodging, in country transportation, food and productions for the dancers that are arriving for the festival. this year we are expecting over 25 dancers from all over the world who will be performing in different cities and venues around Nicaragua. </p>
<p>We are offering great perks in exchange for your donation like: tickets to shows, access to the workshops and seminars, t-shirts of the festival and our most heartfelt gratitude. For the people that are able to donate more we offer full access to all the shows and workshops, a t-shirt, an invitation to the welcome dinner and a chance to have Art-tempo perform at your next event or party.</p>
<p>Every dollar helps. The money raised will go towards the cost of running this festival. </p>
<p>So please help us continue this work that has enriched the lives of so many people in our community as well as abroad.   </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The dance movement in Nicaragua is still developing and many dancers professional and aspiring have limited access to new trends in the dance world.  It is important to open spaces of exchange and offer people here the opportunity to explore, learn and experience different types of modern dance.  </p>
<p>The relationships that dancers have made during the festival have led to international tours and exchanges, scholarships for youth and has opened a dialogue of the importance of contemporary culture in Central America.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>For 22 years I have gone door to door, made phone calls, sent emails to local business and government agencies.  Through the different donations here and there we have been able to house, feed and cover the cost of production for the International Modern Dance Festival.  Each year is a challenge and each year it has been unbelievable rewarding. </p>
<p>This year are usual donors were not able to help us. Which is why I'm reaching out to you and your network to give us a hand this year. The show must go on!</p>

Stackin' Styles Vol. 1 will not only be a powerful launch for the company but for the entire Boston urban dance community 

What We Need & What You Get
We want Stackin’ Styles Vol. 1 to provide you with a high quality experience, and our expenses reflect that. Here is a small breakdown:

4 elite battle guests competing AND teaching at Stackin’ Styles. Dopey Fresh (CA), PopNTod, (CA), Whiteboi (CO), and Stephy Stylez (NJ).
We are bringing in one of the best DJ's in the urban dance culture, Captain Puerto Rico, from Baltimore, Maryland. 
Boston's hometown hero, Chad Shabazz, will be our MC/Host.
Tyrell Black will be flying in from Toronto ON to join Stackz on the judge panel (Soul Brothers) 
 Production/ media team featuring some of Boston's local creatives 
We will hand out awards at the event to honor some of Boston's most dedicated contributors.
 Cash & prizes totaling up to $500 
A dance floor and game show themed set up.

Advertising and marketing expenses. 

We need $2500 to cover these expenses.  $1000 will go directly to StiggityStackz Worldwide Inc to assist with the start up costs. 
 

The Impact
Our goal is to bring all hands on deck to get the ship sailing in the Boston urban dance community. Your contribution will help us reach our community development goals!  Stackin' Stylez vol. 1 is layered with opportunities to improve our city’s dance culture: 

The presence of our battle guests and other world class dancers will provide Boston with the highest level of competition our city has seen in years.
Our judges and battle guests will provide high level dance education at our exclusive event workshops. (See Facebook event page for event format)   
This experience will provide networking and collaboration opportunities aimed at uniting Boston’s influential artists with dancers, studios, and organizations from other regions.

Stackin’ Styles’ unique format has enjoyed major success at similar competitions in other cities and countries:  

Urban Artistry of Washington DC were the first to offer this educational format at their event, The Book of Styles. They since been able to grow their own community and spread their influence worldwide. 

Jack of All Trades, in Montreal, attracts high level dancers from all over the world at each of their installments. Inspired by The Book of Styles, their educational format is a high point at their event as well. 
Our Judge Tyrell Black's company, The BLACKOUT, had an amazing turnout at his event using the “2 to Lose” format, which we are excited to incorporate at Stackin' Stylez Vol. 1.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We need your help to fund this year's Fringe Encore Series.  Started 12 years ago to give top Fringe shows a platform to grow and develop their shows, the Fringe Encore Series has transformed into an internationally recognized festival that curates and develops the top Fringe shows from around the world.  Each Fall, the SoHo Playhouse hosts the Fringe Encore Series.  </p>
<p>This year, we want to bring 16 of the world's top Fringe shows to New York City to perform at the SoHo Playhouse. These shows will push the boundaries of conventional theatre forcing the artist and audience to push the envelope.  </p>
<p>Without contribution, the Fringe Encore Series goes away.  Without the Fringe Encore Series, so much of the risk taking needed to push the performing arts forward goes away.  </p>
<h3><strong>Why We Need $100,000</strong></h3>
<p>We need $100,000 to begin production on this year's Fringe Encore Series.  We can raise a lot of the money from ticket sales, but that is not enough to get started.  There is no New York Fringe Festival this year, meaning that this year's show are going to be coming from across the world.  We need to raise $100,000 to get the 16 shows from across the world back to New York City.  </p>
<ul>
<li>$50,000 will be used to bring the 16 shows back to New York City. </li>
<li>$50,000 will be used as production budget for the shows</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is the Fringe Encore Series </h3>
<p>SoHo Playhouse in New York City is proud to officially host the 2017 Fringe International Encore Series. This year marks the 12th annual Fringe Encore Series. This will be the first year the series expands to include shows from Adelaide, Brighton, Edinburgh, Hollywood and Winnipeg Fringe Festivals. What is the Fringe Encore Series? After years of seeing buzz generated behind several Fringe shows, having them sell out all their festival performances and turn away people at the door and then finding them not being able to find the backing or a space to extend their production; something had to be done, and that is how the Fringe Encore Series was started. Headquartered at the historic SoHo Playhouse, the Fringe Encore Series created a festival to extend these worthy productions The Series gives these shows an additional run at SoHo Playhouse, with the goal of turning these short runs into future productions and successes here in New York City.</p>
<p>Running September and October 2017 this year’s series will present a selection of audience favorites and critical successes selected by a host of theatrical producers, directors and promoters selected from the top Off Broadway Theatres in New York. </p>
<p>The Encore Series helps make this a reality by working with the shows and theaters providing visiting companies, the venue, press representation, technical support, advertising and marketing along with offering developmental advice for each production. Past audiences, along with critics and industry, have found the series to be one of the finest ways to discover emerging companies and writers.</p>
<p>The Series has teams of scouts going to each festival. Once a committee member expresses an interest in a specific show, a representative will make contact with the show to start inquiring as to interest and hopefully facilitating their inclusion in the Encore Series.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Many of the past productions in the series, such as Drama Desk Nominees Krapp 39 from FringeNYC 2008, Jamaica Farewell FringeNYC 2009 and Rap Guide To Religion from Edinburgh Fringe 2015 have gone on to extensive Off-Broadway runs and international success.  Fringe Festival, and consequently Fringe Encore Series is a launching pad for so many different artists.</p>

<p>EPIC FOG THEATRE COMPANY NEEDS YOUR HELP</p>
<p>Two years ago, as a response to our successful production of “Hamlet,” we produced an even more successful production of “Arsenic and Old Lace.” Last year we took time off from producing, but now we are back, with a brand new production of Oscar Wilde’s “The Importance of Being Earnest: A Trivial Comedy about Serious People.”  Our production will go up in February here in New York City: but theatre is not cheap! To keep ticket prices affordable, our budgets have to be so low that it’s hard to pay for, well, anything. In addition to period costumes, the play has three different locations, meaning three sets.</p>
<p>Your donation will help pay for the construction of sets and costumes, the theatre rental, and stipends for our actors and crew. We are planning to pay our actors a larger stipend this time round as well. Our goal $7,500 with a stretch goal of $9,000. The more we make, the more elaborate we can make our sets and the better dressed our actors will be.</p>
<p>The creative team from “Hamlet” and “Arsenic and Old Lace” has been reassembled. Michael Cramer and Hanna Edwards return as producers, and Craig Hutchison will once again direct. Since Arsenic, Michael and Hanna have been working in independent film. Hanna has also been heavily involved in projects at The Actor’s Green Room, and she just shot a commercial (in Spanish). Craig has directed plays with Black Orchid Theatre Company and Nu*Ance Theatre, including directing Michael as Elwood P. Dowd in “Harvey.” This fall,  Craig directed the complete “Oresteia” trilogy by Aeschylus in which Michael portrayed Agamemnon.   </p>
<p>We chose “The Importance of Being Earnest” primarily because we wanted to do another comedy, and because we had the perfect Algernon in fellow actor Cedar Brock. It’s a smaller cast than our last two productions, which will make things a bit easier. However, it has greater demands in terms of sets or even costumes than our earlier plays--it’s easy for us to costume people in Renaissance or 1940s America, but Victorian England is a whole other matter.  </p>
<p>“The Importance of Being Earnest” is a farce of manners--if there can be such a thing--about two men, Jack Worthing and his friend Algernon Moncrief. In order to avoid their everyday responsibilities, they have each created an imaginary person. Algernon has invented an imaginary invalid named Bunburry, whom he has to visit in the country whenever he wants to escape town, while Jack has concocted a fake brother named Earnest, whose indolent ways draw Jack to London whenever he wants a night on the town. </p>
<p>The play was first performed at St. James’ theatre in London on Valentine’s Day, 1895, starring the actor manager George Alexander as Jack. Most critics were unimpressed. George Bernard Shaw called the play “heartless,” While William Archer wrote that it was nothing more than the expression of an irrepressibly witty personality. H. G. Wells, however, considered it one of the funniest plays of the season, and also saw a message in it, joking in his review “...how Serious People will take this Trivial Comedy intended for their learning remains to be seen. No doubt seriously.”</p>
<p>The play closed early due to the scandal surrounding Wilde's affair with Lord Alfred Douglas, which led to his imprisonment for homosexuality. As Wilde’s reputation was rehabilitated after his release from prison, so were his plays, and Earnest was revived several times, first by Alexander then others. Eventually it became one of the most popular plays in the British repertory. It’s been adapted for radio and television, made into six musicals, two operas, and two popular film versions, exactly 50 years apart. In 1995, the British critic and journalist Mark Lawson declared it the second most known and quoted play in English, after Hamlet.</p>

<p>We <strong>Albert Quesada</strong> (ZOO/Thomas Hauert) and <strong>Katie Vickers</strong> (Martin Nachbar, Deborah Hay, Cullberg Ballet) are two dancers/choreographers/teachers living and working in between the U.S. and Brussels, Belgium. Traveling back and forth, we wanted to see more of a dialogue between these two dance communities, thus the birth of Practicing Performance. We hope this platform can be a start into bringing people together to ask questions within two very different contexts, share experiences, and enrich the field at large.</p> <p><strong>So, we invited a group of very talented artists:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Andrew Robinson Champlin </strong>(Miguel Gutierrez, Xavier le Roy, Pam Tanowitz)</p>
<p><strong>Eleanor Bauer </strong>(Rosas, Trisha Brown, Matthew Barney, Boris Charmatz)</p>
<p><strong>Tale Dolven</strong> (Rosas)</p>
<p><strong>Gabel Eiben</strong> (Nature Theatre of Oklahoma, SITI Company)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>WHAT WE NEED: We can't do this without your help! </strong></h3>
<p>We have an ambitious sum of money to reach but are confident that these two communities can come together to make this happen! We are looking for $8.000 to be able to cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>travel costs</li>
<li>accommodation</li>
<li>teachers fees</li>
<li>promotion + marketing</li>
<li>studio rentals</li>
<li>tech [sound|lighting| for the performances</li>
</ul>
<p>Please know that whether you donate* $5 or $3,000 every penny counts and it really does make a difference!</p>
<p>We are so passionate that no matter how the funds go, we will push forward with this first year's festival edition. We are engaged with our artists and believe the community will benefit tremendously from it.</p>
<h3><strong>THE IMPACT </strong></h3>
<p>We believe art is necessary for a society where new points of view, reflection, and communication are essential for a better living. With this festival, we want to practice sharing and exchanging, a place where people can meet on equal grounds to share tools, knowledge, and to foster a sense of togetherness. We hope that by gathering artists from different backgrounds and contexts sparks an environment where we can support different ways of working and thinking.</p> <p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>A festival is a space.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This space is supportive and caring.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This space is working towards the development of art practices.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This space is an exchange of ideas.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This space is critically thinking about dance and its place today.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p> <h3><strong>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</strong></h3>
<p>This is our first year starting <strong>PP</strong> and with that, there are always challenges and huge risks to face.</p>
<p>We foresee three major challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organizing the 2-week festival to our vision</li>
<li>Getting the needed funding</li>
<li>Attracting artists and participants to the festival.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope to overcome these challenges with our experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>As directors:</strong> (we have directed a summer program, Performing Arts Intensive, for over 5 years at Mercersburg Academy. As directors, we’ve organized the festival from start to finish from newsletters and marketing to the final performances at the end of two weeks.)</li>
<li>
<strong>As creators:</strong> we have created over 12 dance performances over the last 10 years, including looking for funding, employing other artists, and managing the company's touring.</li>
<li>
<strong>As teachers:</strong> we have taught in many countries, in academies, private studios, and universities.</li>
</ul>
<p>With this experience and the help of the other artists, we are confident that Practicing Performance in any shape or form will be a success.</p> <h3><strong>Can't donate but still want to help?</strong></h3>
<p>Some people can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about this campaign.</li>
<li>Reach out to us as we get closer to find out if there are organizational ways in which you can be involved with the festival.</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools!</li>

We Albert Quesada (ZOO/Thomas Hauert) and Katie Vickers (Martin Nachbar, Deborah Hay, Cullberg Ballet) are two dancers/choreographers/teachers living and working in between the U.S. and Brussels, Belgium. Traveling back and forth, we wanted to see more of a dialogue between these two dance communities, thus the birth of Practicing Performance. We hope this platform can be a start into bringing people together to ask questions within two very different contexts, share experiences, and enrich the field at large. So, we invited a group of very talented artists:
Andrew Robinson Champlin (Miguel Gutierrez, Xavier le Roy, Pam Tanowitz)
Eleanor Bauer (Rosas, Trisha Brown, Matthew Barney, Boris Charmatz)
Tale Dolven (Rosas)
Gabel Eiben (Nature Theatre of Oklahoma, SITI Company)
 
WHAT WE NEED: We can't do this without your help! 
We have an ambitious sum of money to reach but are confident that these two communities can come together to make this happen! We are looking for $8.000 to be able to cover:

travel costs
accommodation
teachers fees
promotion + marketing
studio rentals
tech [sound|lighting| for the performances

Please know that whether you donate* $5 or $3,000 every penny counts and it really does make a difference!
We are so passionate that no matter how the funds go, we will push forward with this first year's festival edition. We are engaged with our artists and believe the community will benefit tremendously from it.
THE IMPACT 
We believe art is necessary for a society where new points of view, reflection, and communication are essential for a better living. With this festival, we want to practice sharing and exchanging, a place where people can meet on equal grounds to share tools, knowledge, and to foster a sense of togetherness. We hope that by gathering artists from different backgrounds and contexts sparks an environment where we can support different ways of working and thinking. A festival is a space.
This space is supportive and caring.
This space is working towards the development of art practices.
This space is an exchange of ideas.
This space is critically thinking about dance and its place today.
This space is for training skills (for performance, for creation).

  RISKS & CHALLENGES
This is our first year starting PP and with that, there are always challenges and huge risks to face.
We foresee three major challenges:

Organizing the 2-week festival to our vision
Getting the needed funding
Attracting artists and participants to the festival.

We hope to overcome these challenges with our experience:


As directors: (we have directed a summer program, Performing Arts Intensive, for over 5 years at Mercersburg Academy. As directors, we’ve organized the festival from start to finish from newsletters and marketing to the final performances at the end of two weeks.)

As creators: we have created over 12 dance performances over the last 10 years, including looking for funding, employing other artists, and managing the company's touring.

As teachers: we have taught in many countries, in academies, private studios, and universities.

With this experience and the help of the other artists, we are confident that Practicing Performance in any shape or form will be a success. Can't donate but still want to help?
Some people can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:

Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about this campaign.
Reach out to us as we get closer to find out if there are organizational ways in which you can be involved with the festival.
Use the Indiegogo share tools!
