<b>A
Brief Introduction</b></p>
<p>
Hey
there! We are Reckon Point. Nice to see you took the time to read
this.</p>
<p>
We
are a new, innovating company that is designing an app, just for you,
that will help you locate exactly what you need; from your seat in a
theater, to the can of tomatoes your mother just has to have. This
app will get you where you need to be, when you need to be
there-plus, it will advertise any sales going on in shops you enter.
Perfect for when you want those pair of shoes!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Using
advanced technology developed by the team, this app will be using a
Geo-location  navigation system that can be accessed though a cloud,
where thousands upon thousands of stores and items will reside. Cool,
huh? Reckon Point will tell you where to find these items, and how to
get to them. All it takes is some calibration!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<b>What
We Need, &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>
So,
you're wondering-why such a large amount of donations? In fact, what
do we need? While we can't tell you exactly what we need (top
secret!), we can guarantee that this money will be used to help make
this technology even better than it already is. Parts are expensive,
and we need anything we can possibly get.  Even if you can't donate,
we also need people to spread the word as much as possible. How else
will people know about this? By doing that, you would really be doing
us a favor. Plus, it would make you look wicked cool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
What
you'll get in return is listed in the perks. You have the chance of
being an amazing donor, plus you'll get some pretty awesome gifts too,
besides the app that is being made. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p><br/>
</p><p>
<b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>
This
solution is what the world has been waiting for: sub-meter indoor
positioning! But first, we need to do the behind the scenes work.
Currently, we are developing a prototype collection system that can
gather the data. Creating an app is useless until you have data
to work with. Since each location is unique, a system is needed that can
quickly and easily maneuver indoors to collect these types of
signals. Cool, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Reckon
Point wants this technology to become the standard indoor positioning
solution providing sub-meter accuracy for everyone to use and for
other companies to build upon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Can
you imagine never being lost again, feeling fear of losing your kids
or being scared in emergency situations?  
</p>
<p>
Especially
if you're under a lot of pressure-say, you're looking for a specific
room that you're meeting is in. You don't know if they could have
changed the room, so that's one tick-Reckon Point will tell you if
you're meeting has been moved or canceled. Then, trying to locate the
room. Reading signs can get confusing, and you may not always
remember what floor number it could be on. With Reckon Point, there's
absolutely no worry. All you have to do is find your meeting, and
check the stats. Perfectly handy for when you've had a rough morning
(and, hopefully, some coffee.)</p>
<p>
</p><p></p><p>Reckon
Point’s technology can also be used to help the seeing impaired navigate around
complex buildings such as hospitals.  There are people who have a hard
time reading distant signs and small wall maps.  With turn by turn indoor
navigation, people can regain their independence and feel comfortable
navigating in complex indoor environments. </p>
<p>Another
benefit of this technology is the ability to track inventory in a large
building.  Imagine being able to know where high value assets are at a
moment’s notice saving time and money.  Many companies spend a significant
amount of time tracking down inventory. Our technology allows for real time
inventory location on a map.  A system based on our indoor location
technology could be developed to click on an item in an inventory list and a
map would show where the item is in the building</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>The
Competition of a Company</b></p>
<p>
While
other companies presently provide indoor location solutions, none of
them have yet been able to reliably provide consistent sub-meter
accuracy. Our 30 years combined DOD experience in signal intelligence
and geo-location systems will provide the edge needed to solve this
problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Preliminary
results show consistent 1 meter accuracy with sparse data. Now,
imagine what we can do with high resolution data!</p>
<p><br/>
</p><p>
<b>What
Other Ways Can You Help?</b></p>
<p>
You
can help us by liking our Facebook page and sending it around to
people who may be interested.  We also have a Twitter, if you want to
check that out. By spreading the word through social media, you'll
help boost what's coming your way.</p>
<p>
Tell
your friends! Tell you family! Heck, tell your boss about this! Tell
anyone you possibly can. Make it a competition, and see how many
people you can tell!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
If
you are willing to donate, anything helps! Ten dollars, twenty, one
hundred...perhaps even a penny. Anything to reach our goal. Every
dollar donated helps!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Follow
us on our social media, as a sign of support, and if you're a small
business starting out,we will follow you back. Other companies showing
support for our own is quite amazing, and we'd love to support you
back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
If
you're an investor, and would like to help fund Reckon Point, please
contact the founder privately.  We want to work within the community
to help develop a standard database structure and solution.  
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
What
will you use Reckon Point for?</p>
<p>
Send
us a short video on what you would use Reckon Point app for!  We are
starting a little competition on our Facebook page, and it goes like
this:</p>
<p>
“ I
would use Reckon Point for....”</p>
<p>
Keep
it lively! We love cool and edgy videos, and if we like it we'll add
it to our YouTube Chanel and our website!</p>

amount of time tracking down inventory. Our technology allows for real time
inventory location on a map.  A system based on our indoor location
technology could be developed to click on an item in an inventory list and a
map would show where the item is in the building
The
Competition of a Company

While
other companies presently provide indoor location solutions, none of
them have yet been able to reliably provide consistent sub-meter
accuracy. Our 30 years combined DOD experience in signal intelligence
and geo-location systems will provide the edge needed to solve this
problem.


Preliminary
results show consistent 1 meter accuracy with sparse data. Now,
imagine what we can do with high resolution data!

<div><br/></div>
<h4>The Importance of Isokinetics:</h4>
<div><br/></div>
<p>Findings demonstrate that isokinetic training at both low and high speeds can be superior to traditional isotonic methods of training. And the use of isokinetics on injured joints for evaluation and rehabilitation commonplace.</p>
<p>Isokinetic exercise provides variable resistance to a movement so that no matter how much effort is exerted, the movement takes place at a constant speed.  Isokinetic exercise allows for the highest degree of muscle contraction while also promoting a free range of movement of the limbs.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>In isokinetic training, the resistance is controlled by the equipment    -  so there is no external loading. This form of resistance prevents muscle damage, which prevents soreness and overtraining.         </p>
<p>Isokinetic exercise is primarily used on isolated joint movements. In rehabilitation and sport, they are used to obtain objective recordings of muscular function. Results are used in performer screening and testing, thereby, establishing both a performance baseline and a database for periodic assessment. However, every study reporting superior results may or may not translate into real-world, multi-joint, closed-chin movement goals.                   </p>
<p>
</p>
<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>The Kinetic Chain:</h4>
<div><br/></div>
<p>The term ""kinetic chain"" is used to describe how you are moving the parts of your body. If the moving parts are allowed to move freely in space, it is known as an Open Kinetic Chain (OKC) movement. On the other hand, if the moving parts are pressing against an unrelenting surface, it is known as a Closed Kinetic Chain (CKC) movement. </p>
<p>In OKC exercises the force applied by the body is great enough to overcome the resistance. An example would be a bench press or leg press, where applied muscle force moves the load away from the body. CKC exercises are characterized by muscle force that is not great enough to overcome the resistance. An example would be the squat exercise, where the force generated is applied to the ground, not the bar. The body parts that the resistance moves through make up the components of the chain.</p>
<p>Open Kinetic Chain exercises are movements where the force applied by the body is great enough to overcome the resistance. An example of an open chain exercise would be a bench press, or any leg press which allows the force applied to move the load away from the body.</p>
<p>The kinetic chain is only as strong as the weakest link. Therefore, applications of isokinetic exercise and isolated joint testing along the kinetic chain is important. <br/></p>
<p>If the clinician were to never measure the strength of the joints along the kinetic chain, then the weak link can never be identified for rehabilitation.</p>
<br/>
<h4>Open Kinetic Chain Exercises vs Closed Kinetic Chain Exercises:</h4>
<div><br/></div>
<p>The upper extremity functions almost exclusively in an OKC pattern. The throwing motion, volleyball spike, tennis serve, and golf stroke are all examples of OKC activities. On the other hand, most functional movements of the lower extremity occur in a CKC environment. Lower extremity CKC movements include all forms of upright human locomotion.</p>
<p>CKC exercise is more functional because it closely simulates the actual movement patterns encountered in both sport and daily activities. For example, when pushing off of the ground, the hip, knee, and ankle move together in a CKC movement. With athletes, CKC exercise has been shown to greatly improve functional strength and jumping ability.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4>Isolated vs Multi-joint Movement:</h4>
<div><br/></div>
<p>Isolated muscle action at a singel joint can identify the weak link. However, all joints in a kinetic chain must work together for optimal function. If a muscle cannot function normally within either an OKC or CKC pattern, then the functional movement will suffer, and risk of injury (or re-injury) will be higher.</p>
<p>Therefore, during training and rehabilitation, it is critical that the body learns (or re-learns) how the parts must work together along the kinetic chain for optimal performance and minimal risk of injury. This involves the entire neuromuscular system, and can only be accomplished with multi-joint exercise.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Advantages of Multi-joint, Closed Kinetic Chain Exercise:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Isolated, single-joint exercises can evaluate and train isolated muscles along the kinetic chain. However, movements in sport and activity always involve multi-joint patterns.</p>
<p>In rehabilitation, single-joint exercises at controlled isokinetic speeds are used to restore muscle strength. However, when training for functional movements, multi-joint, CKC exercises are preferred.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>CKC exercises are safer - particularly with regard to healing knee and shoulder injuries, because they create less shear stress across injured or healing joints. Furthermore, multi-joint CKC exercise will improve proprioception and reflex stabilization, thus reducing pain and promoting <b>a FASTER and MORE COMPLETE RETURN to DAILY ACTIVITIES and SPORTS.</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The RK-7 technology is the only type of system that provides all of these conditions: multi-joint, open and/or closed kinetic chain exercise under conditions of controlled speed. </p>
<p>The RK-7 is not limited to simple isokinetics - that is only one of many functions. With our responsive resistance, any pattern of speed can be programmed to meet user-specific capabilities and needs. in addition, isotonic and/or isometric conditions can be added.</p>
<p><b>With the RK-7, we take rehabilitation and performance training to the next level.</b></p>

</div>","The RK-7 responds to suit the user's specific needs -- something that can't be accomplished as accurately and efficiently in the weight room or physical therapy facility. 


Our technology responds uniquely to each user to meet individual goals, and can track the user's progress and evolve. Users move in complete safety, with no external loads and minimal muscle damage. As users move through full ranges of motion, muscles are never overstressed, leading to quicker recovery times. The RK7 provides the optimal conditions for neuromuscular performance and development.
There are nearly 23 million veterans in the United States and many of them have sustained both mental and/or physical injuries during their service. It is our sincere hope to help meet the unique rehabilitative needs of our disabled veterans, particularly those who suffer from neuromuscular and physical disability. Our team believes disabled veterans deserve the best care possible, and that the RK7 is the most effective, safest, and efficient way to restore optimal function of the human performer. By doing everything possible to rehabilitate our veterans, we ensure to promote greater movement potential and quality of life. 

It is our goal as a company to facilitate the rehabilitation of disabled veterans.   We will revolutionize the arena of human performance with the RK-7 in areas of  rehabilitation, performance and evaluation. Unique applications are available to every demographic. And we intend to demonstrate the benefits of our RK7 technology for each.
Our corporate identity will set the tone for future corporations to come. A corporation with a social awareness of the individual need's of the community that surrounds us.

[4] Glossary of Terms:

Forms of Exercise:



Isotonic -- A contraction where the muscle changes length when moving against a constant load. (Example: dumbbell curl)

Isometric -- A contraction when joint angle and muscle length do not change. (Example: pushing against a wall)

Isokinetic -- A contraction when the muscle contracts maximally and speed of movement does not change.






The Importance of Isokinetics:

Findings demonstrate that isokinetic training at both low and high speeds can be superior to traditional isotonic methods of training. And the use of isokinetics on injured joints for evaluation and rehabilitation commonplace.
Isokinetic exercise provides variable resistance to a movement so that no matter how much effort is exerted, the movement takes place at a constant speed.  Isokinetic exercise allows for the highest degree of muscle contraction while also promoting a free range of movement of the limbs.


In isokinetic training, the resistance is controlled by the equipment    -  so there is no external loading. This form of resistance prevents muscle damage, which prevents soreness and overtraining.         
Isokinetic exercise is primarily used on isolated joint movements. In rehabilitation and sport, they are used to obtain objective recordings of muscular function. Results are used in performer screening and testing, thereby, establishing both a performance baseline and a database for periodic assessment. However, every study reporting superior results may or may not translate into real-world, multi-joint, closed-chin movement goals.                   



The Kinetic Chain:

The term ""kinetic chain"" is used to describe how you are moving the parts of your body. If the moving parts are allowed to move freely in space, it is known as an Open Kinetic Chain (OKC) movement. On the other hand, if the moving parts are pressing against an unrelenting surface, it is known as a Closed Kinetic Chain (CKC) movement. 
In OKC exercises the force applied by the body is great enough to overcome the resistance. An example would be a bench press or leg press, where applied muscle force moves the load away from the body. CKC exercises are characterized by muscle force that is not great enough to overcome the resistance. An example would be the squat exercise, where the force generated is applied to the ground, not the bar. The body parts that the resistance moves through make up the components of the chain.
Open Kinetic Chain exercises are movements where the force applied by the body is great enough to overcome the resistance. An example of an open chain exercise would be a bench press, or any leg press which allows the force applied to move the load away from the body.
The kinetic chain is only as strong as the weakest link. Therefore, applications of isokinetic exercise and isolated joint testing along the kinetic chain is important. 
If the clinician were to never measure the strength of the joints along the kinetic chain, then the weak link can never be identified for rehabilitation.

Open Kinetic Chain Exercises vs Closed Kinetic Chain Exercises:

The upper extremity functions almost exclusively in an OKC pattern. The throwing motion, volleyball spike, tennis serve, and golf stroke are all examples of OKC activities. On the other hand, most functional movements of the lower extremity occur in a CKC environment. Lower extremity CKC movements include all forms of upright human locomotion.
CKC exercise is more functional because it closely simulates the actual movement patterns encountered in both sport and daily activities. For example, when pushing off of the ground, the hip, knee, and ankle move together in a CKC movement. With athletes, CKC exercise has been shown to greatly improve functional strength and jumping ability.

Isolated vs Multi-joint Movement:

Isolated muscle action at a singel joint can identify the weak link. However, all joints in a kinetic chain must work together for optimal function. If a muscle cannot function normally within either an OKC or CKC pattern, then the functional movement will suffer, and risk of injury (or re-injury) will be higher.
Therefore, during training and rehabilitation, it is critical that the body learns (or re-learns) how the parts must work together along the kinetic chain for optimal performance and minimal risk of injury. This involves the entire neuromuscular system, and can only be accomplished with multi-joint exercise.

Advantages of Multi-joint, Closed Kinetic Chain Exercise:

Isolated, single-joint exercises can evaluate and train isolated muscles along the kinetic chain. However, movements in sport and activity always involve multi-joint patterns.
In rehabilitation, single-joint exercises at controlled isokinetic speeds are used to restore muscle strength. However, when training for functional movements, multi-joint, CKC exercises are preferred.

CKC exercises are safer - particularly with regard to healing knee and shoulder injuries, because they create less shear stress across injured or healing joints. Furthermore, multi-joint CKC exercise will improve proprioception and reflex stabilization, thus reducing pain and promoting a FASTER and MORE COMPLETE RETURN to DAILY ACTIVITIES and SPORTS.

The RK-7 technology is the only type of system that provides all of these conditions: multi-joint, open and/or closed kinetic chain exercise under conditions of controlled speed. 
The RK-7 is not limited to simple isokinetics - that is only one of many functions. With our responsive resistance, any pattern of speed can be programmed to meet user-specific capabilities and needs. in addition, isotonic and/or isometric conditions can be added.
With the RK-7, we take rehabilitation and performance training to the next level.





[5] RK-7 Rehabilitation Process:

Early Stages - Post-Injury / Surgery

The RK-7's Isokinetic, or Variable Velocity Mode, allows for early stage rehabilitation with minimal risk of re-injury. The user can use maximum effort while avoiding unnecessary pain and muscle fatigue, which helps to safely restore normal range of motion.
In this passive mode, the RK-7 offers accommodating resistance to the forces exerted by the user during acceleration and deceleration throughout a range of motion and during isometric holds. At the same time, speed and velocity patterns of user movement can be set by the clinician to more realistically simulate dynamics of real motion; true and natural biomechanics.
The RK-7 Isometric Mode helps to identify and test specific joints and muscles, which enables clinicians to pinpoint areas of weakness and equips them with the ability to strengthen these areas safely and comfortably.

Middle Stages – Restore Strength & Return to Function

The RK-7 Isotonic, or Variable Resistance Mode, allows for varying resistance within and at any point during a particular range of motion to accommodate for injuries and natural mechanical inefficiencies.
The mechanical advantage of most muscles changes as the associated joint is flexed or extended. The variable resistance feature compensates for this change by becoming progressively easier or more difficult, thereby maintaining  constant muscular exertion throughout the entire range of movement.
The RK-7's unique ability to create isometric “sticking” points at any one specific point, or at multiple points along the range of motion, allows clinicians to target contractions at different problem points through the range of motion.


Final Stages – Building Power, Strength, & Speed

Most functional, task, and sport-specific movements occur in a Closed Kinetic Chain environment. Therefore, you need a machine that can train in the same way. With the RK-7,users can train just as they would perform in everyday life or even on the field of play.
Closed Kinetic Chain exercise protocols are used extensively in the rehabilitation of many injuries from the ankle, to the knee, to the shoulder. They are preferable to other exercise protocols in that Closed Kinetic Chan simulates normal physiology and encourages natural biomechanics. This creates minimal shear stress across injured or healing joints, reproduces proprioceptive stimuli, and allows for use in early rehabilitation; integral aspects of any “accelerated"" rehabilitation program.
Only the RK-7 controls velocity and force and provides bi-directional, isokinetic features to mimic real-life movements associated with normal and even extraordinary (high adrenaline or athletic) performance. The RK-7 easily adapts to each individual user, simulating natural movement patterns previously unattainable with other systems. The value of an exercise therapy prescription and the validity of performance data no longer need to be compromised by lack of movement specificity.

<p>That was the beginning of the
Armore™ wearable arm exerciser, a resistance training exoskeleton. I spent many
months designing and redesigning the arm exerciser. When I finished, the end
result was a lightweight (under 7 ounces) exerciser that emulated pressing up
to 50 pounds.  </p>
<p>My board of directors, several
consultants, and advisors come from the fitness, medical, and business world
volunteered time to help perfect the Armore™ wearable arm exerciser and its
functionality. </p>
<p></p>
<h1>Originally designed for people who hate to exercise! </h1>
<p><span>...  </span>You don’t like to exercise. It’s boring torture.</p>
<p>...<span> 
</span>You are embarrassed, or have no time, or don’t want
an expensive membership to a fitness club. </p>
<p>...<span> 
</span>And your typical New Year’s Resolution to get in
shape lasts about a day. </p>
<p>That’s okay. You sound exactly like me: <i>A desk potato.</i> I never had the time to exercise or join a gym. And
when I did, I hated it. After a few weeks, my best of intentions evaporated. It
was an expensive waste of money. </p>
<p>Meet the Armore™ wearable arm exerciser.  </p>
<p><b>Here’s what it does…</b></p>
<p>The Armore™ wearable arm exerciser is an exoskeleton trainer
that provides upper arm strengthening. A wearable exerciser weighing only 7
ounces, you can experience up to 50 pounds of resistance. That produces the
same benefit as if you were at a gym using free weights. </p>
<p>The Armore™ wearable arm exerciser works for you <i>anywhere, anytime.</i> Simply slip it on in the
morning (hidden under your clothing, too, if you’re on your way to work).  Adjust the amount of resistance you want, and
your workout begins immediately. Every time you move,
you’re exercising!</p>
<p>All
you have to do is remember to put it on! Wear it around the house. Whether
you’re typing on your computer, sitting on the couch watching television,  texting
on your smart phone, walking to the water cooler, or doing laundry, the
anatomically-correct and efficient Armore™ wearable arm exerciser:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Strengthens your entire upper arm including biceps, triceps,
cartilage, ligaments, tendons, and bone</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Burns away fat and tones your arms (even at low settings)</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Enhances your performance as it builds strength and endurance</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Stimulates repetitive muscle activity throughout the body</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Strengthens connective tissue, bone, and muscle</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Allows your hands to remain free to take care of your daily
tasks</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Helps you maintain your fitness regimen because your fitness
regimen goes with you wherever you go</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>And much more!</p>
<p>I use it every day. Whether I’m at my desk, working in the
yard, washing the car, or working on the computer, <b>IT WORKS!</b> That’s why I guarantee it. </p>
<p><b><i>Use the Armore™ wearable arm exerciser routinely
for four weeks. If you don’t realize the benefits of the arm exerciser or
obtain bicep growth, return it to me for full refund.</i></b></p>
<p>But I know if you use <b><i>Armore™ wearable arm exerciser</i></b>, you will like it! Because all
you have to do is <i>put it on!</i> Whenever
you’re wearing the Armore™ wearable arm exerciser, you’re exercising. </p>
<p><b>It’s easy to use…</b></p>
<p><b>First time setup </b></p>
<p>You can
wear the Armore™ wearable arm resistance training exoskeleton all day. Without
consciously thinking about exercise, you are strengthening your muscles,
tendons, cartilage, and bones. </p>
<p>Once
the Armore™ arm exerciser is properly adjusted, always start by opening the
exerciser to its fully extended position. Then slip your arm into the Armore™
arm exerciser. Once set up, you should only need to tighten the top of the
upper-arm cuff and wrist cuff. The over-the-forearm cuff should be already
adjusted. <u><span>Watch the video</span></u>. </p>
<p><b>Adjusting the amount of resistance </b></p>
<p>The Armore™ wearable arm exerciser has four (4) knobs, two
on each side of your elbow. Increasing the tightness of the knobs increases the
amount of resistance. Fully tightened, it achieves the equivalent of pressing
about 50 pounds. Watch the video below for complete instructions. Even when
worn under clothing, it’s easy to adjust the tension knobs. <u>Watch the video</u>.</p>
<p><b>Releasing the Armore™ arm exerciser </b></p>
<p>To release the Armore™ wearable arm exerciser, extend your
arm fully. Release the upper arm cuff and the top of the wrist cuff. You should
not need to release or adjust the forearm cuff or the bottom of the cuffs. Carefully
fold the Armore™ wearable arm exerciser and return it to its nylon storage
pouch. </p>
<p><b>Meet the
Inventor</b></p>
<p>My name is Steven Cersonsky.
I’m the inventor of the Armore™ wearable arm exerciser. I invented it because I
hate exercising and always have. </p>
<p>In 2009, I had a business partner who was 6’
2” tall and weighed 220 pounds. He was in great shape. While I was at my desk
chomping on a burger and fries for lunch, trying to solve another engineering design
problem, he’d be working out at a fitness center, miles from our office. </p>
<p>He was always trying to pull me out of my
chair and go to his gym. I wanted to get in shape, but I had little time,
inclination, or self-confidence to go to the gym. For me, working out was torture.
From time to time, I’d concede to go. The only way I would ever enjoy working
out was when I didn’t have to think about it, such as a competitive game. </p>
<p>I tried water aerobics for a brief time
because of the extra resistance it provided without additional strain on my
body. But that didn’t do it for me, either. Boring.</p>
<p>I decided I’d try to lift weights at my
desk. I quickly realized I couldn’t use my computer and lift weights at the
same time. The weights just sat on the floor in the corner gathering dust. So I
looked for an alternative to weights. </p>
<p>As a sci-fi and science buff, I’d always
been fascinated with gravity. Muscles are the biological way that we overcome
gravity. So, with this knowledge, and the science of increased resistance, repetitive
weight lifting, and water exercise, I came up with an idea and a design. I
began to construct my first prototype. In 2009 I filed for the first
patent using a prototype made of duct tape, lug nuts, painting sticks, and
other items that were readily available. </p>
<p>Six years of experimentation and remodeling
have brought the Armore™ wearable arm exerciser and me to where we are today. </p>
<p>With today’s knowledge that <i>repetition is better than heavy weights</i>,
I continue to build muscles and tendons without strain from heavy
weights.  And it turns out that there are many other benefits from this
type of exercise.  Increased endurance,
blood flow, and the general strengthening of the connective tissue and bone.</p>
<p>Compared to my early prototypes, the Armore™
wearable arm exerciser of today is very comfortable and made of quality
materials –– most of which weren’t available 20 years ago. The Armore™
exerciser I want to send to you is made of glass-infused nylon, a crank-down
device is made out of nickel, gaskets and washers made out of BUMA (a high tech
type of synthetic rubber for longevity and maximum friction), and neoprene
straps with Velcro fasteners. </p>
<p>The Armore™ wearable arm exerciser weighs
only 7 ounces. It can be adjusted up to 50 pounds of resistance –– while you’re
sitting at your desk, grocery shopping, or watching TV. Every time you move,
you’re exercising! Order yours today. </p>
<p><b>Take the Armore™ wearable
arm exerciser seriously</b></p>
<p>As you can imagine, I had a number of friends using the
Armore™ wearable arm exerciser during its development. My friends who were younger,
more athletic and muscular benefited even more than me from wearing it on a
regular basis. One of my friends confessed that he felt he was being “beat up”
by the Armore™ wearable arm exerciser because of the additional resistance during
his workout. His increased results were because he cranked the resistance to
max.  So much so, I was surprised he didn’t
break it! </p>
<p><b><u>THE
SCIENCE</u></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Here’s the science behind
the Armore™ wearable arm exerciser</b></p>
<p>Muscles
come in pairs. </p>
<p>When one muscle of a pair contracts, its counterpart muscle contracts
and pulls in the opposite direction. Without this arrangement you wouldn't be
able to straighten your arm after lifting it.</p>
<p>When your biceps muscle in your upper arm contracts, it pulls
your lower arm in towards your shoulder. When it relaxes, your biceps can’t
push your arm back out. To do this, your triceps muscle, the muscles on the underneath
of your upper arm, contract to straighten your arm out. If your triceps muscle
wasn't there, your arm couldn’t straighten. You’d be unable to extend your arm.</p>
<p>My body builder friends look the way they do because of the amount of time, number of repetitions, and weight they lift and, of course, this works for them because of their strong commitment.  </p>
<p>Most of us, however, don’t have the time or that level of commitment. We just want to be healthy, keep our body in shape, and looking our best.  So how does one achieve this?   When you lift free weights or work out with commercial
fitness center equipment, the weight itself is what taxes the biceps and the triceps
muscles (one pulling, the other relaxing). The more the weight or resistance,
the greater the muscle strength needed to overcome it.  Adding resistance to your natural movement is how <b>Armore™ wearable arm exerciser works.</b></p>
<p>Scientifically engineered and weighing in at only 7 ounces,
the Armore™ wearable arm exerciser provides similar results as lifting and
pushing free weights or using commercial fitness center equipment. </p>
<p>But it does so in the most convenient way –– because you wear
it anywhere, anytime… and because it’s adjustable up to 50 pounds of
resistance. All you have to do is remember to put in on.  Every time you move,
you’re exercising!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>We’re
looking to raise $59,000. Your investment of $59.00 or more buys you two (2)
Armore™ wearable arm exercisers and earns you our most sincere gratitude.  </p>
<p>We’re
also looking to connect with fitness centers and trainers in the U.S. for beta
testing the Armore™ wearable arm exerciser in those environments. For an
investment of $290.00, we’ll send 10 Armore™ arm exerciser to a fitness center
or trainer. This would require some reporting, monitoring bicep size and muscle
tone, resolution of pain or reduction of the occurrence of pain on the part of
the fitness centers or trainers. We’d also be looking for testimonials from
those who are most successful with the arm exerciser. (It’s not complicated. Mostly,
success is based on frequency and consistency of wearing the exerciser.)  </p>
<p>If
we fail to reach our goal of $59,000, we’ll use those funds in two ways. First,
contribute to physiology research and use some funds for future R&amp;D.
Second, while our ultimate goal is a full-body exoskeleton, our next step is a
knee exerciser. Some funds will be used for R&amp;D in that regard. </p>

<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Fitness.
Health. Mind-body balance. Personal wellbeing. They are priorities for many
Americans. The Armore™ wearable arm exerciser is a great solution for those who
want to stay in shape but are constantly on the go and don’t have or take the time
to maintain a regular fitness regimen. </p>
<p>The
Armore™ wearable arm exerciser can do that. Our tests with prototypes showed an
average ¼ inch bicep growth per week for people who used the exerciser for
three 3 weeks. Athletes often added 4-times that, depending on amount of time
used.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>With
30-plus years of experience as a developer, project manager, engineer, and
inventor, I know that things don’t always go as planned. </p>
<p>While
there have been setbacks along the way in the development of the Armore™
wearable arm exerciser, each and every challenge was met and overcome. Three

that would:

Allow my
     hands to be free. (That eliminated conventional weights.)
Be lightweight,
     durable, and washable.
Be low
     profile, so it could be comfortably worn under clothing while I was
     working.
Be simple to
     use –– something I could just slip on in the morning and wear all day, if
     I wanted.

Be affordable.



That was the beginning of the
Armore™ wearable arm exerciser, a resistance training exoskeleton. I spent many
months designing and redesigning the arm exerciser. When I finished, the end
result was a lightweight (under 7 ounces) exerciser that emulated pressing up
to 50 pounds.  
My board of directors, several
consultants, and advisors come from the fitness, medical, and business world
volunteered time to help perfect the Armore™ wearable arm exerciser and its
functionality. 

Originally designed for people who hate to exercise! 
...  You don’t like to exercise. It’s boring torture.
... 
You are embarrassed, or have no time, or don’t want
an expensive membership to a fitness club. 
... 
And your typical New Year’s Resolution to get in
shape lasts about a day. 
That’s okay. You sound exactly like me: A desk potato. I never had the time to exercise or join a gym. And
when I did, I hated it. After a few weeks, my best of intentions evaporated. It
was an expensive waste of money. 
Meet the Armore™ wearable arm exerciser.  
Here’s what it does…
The Armore™ wearable arm exerciser is an exoskeleton trainer
that provides upper arm strengthening. A wearable exerciser weighing only 7
ounces, you can experience up to 50 pounds of resistance. That produces the
same benefit as if you were at a gym using free weights. 
The Armore™ wearable arm exerciser works for you anywhere, anytime. Simply slip it on in the
morning (hidden under your clothing, too, if you’re on your way to work).  Adjust the amount of resistance you want, and
your workout begins immediately. Every time you move,
you’re exercising!
All
you have to do is remember to put it on! Wear it around the house. Whether
you’re typing on your computer, sitting on the couch watching television,  texting
on your smart phone, walking to the water cooler, or doing laundry, the
anatomically-correct and efficient Armore™ wearable arm exerciser:
· 
Strengthens your entire upper arm including biceps, triceps,
cartilage, ligaments, tendons, and bone
· 
Burns away fat and tones your arms (even at low settings)
· 
Enhances your performance as it builds strength and endurance
· 
Stimulates repetitive muscle activity throughout the body
· 
Strengthens connective tissue, bone, and muscle
· 
Allows your hands to remain free to take care of your daily
tasks
· 
Helps you maintain your fitness regimen because your fitness
regimen goes with you wherever you go
· 
And much more!
I use it every day. Whether I’m at my desk, working in the
yard, washing the car, or working on the computer, IT WORKS! That’s why I guarantee it. 
Use the Armore™ wearable arm exerciser routinely
for four weeks. If you don’t realize the benefits of the arm exerciser or
obtain bicep growth, return it to me for full refund.
But I know if you use Armore™ wearable arm exerciser, you will like it! Because all
you have to do is put it on! Whenever
you’re wearing the Armore™ wearable arm exerciser, you’re exercising. 
It’s easy to use…
First time setup 
You can
wear the Armore™ wearable arm resistance training exoskeleton all day. Without
consciously thinking about exercise, you are strengthening your muscles,
tendons, cartilage, and bones. 
Once
the Armore™ arm exerciser is properly adjusted, always start by opening the
exerciser to its fully extended position. Then slip your arm into the Armore™
arm exerciser. Once set up, you should only need to tighten the top of the
upper-arm cuff and wrist cuff. The over-the-forearm cuff should be already
adjusted. Watch the video. 
Adjusting the amount of resistance 
The Armore™ wearable arm exerciser has four (4) knobs, two
on each side of your elbow. Increasing the tightness of the knobs increases the
amount of resistance. Fully tightened, it achieves the equivalent of pressing
about 50 pounds. Watch the video below for complete instructions. Even when
worn under clothing, it’s easy to adjust the tension knobs. Watch the video.
Releasing the Armore™ arm exerciser 
To release the Armore™ wearable arm exerciser, extend your
arm fully. Release the upper arm cuff and the top of the wrist cuff. You should
not need to release or adjust the forearm cuff or the bottom of the cuffs. Carefully
fold the Armore™ wearable arm exerciser and return it to its nylon storage
pouch. 
Meet the
Inventor
My name is Steven Cersonsky.
I’m the inventor of the Armore™ wearable arm exerciser. I invented it because I
hate exercising and always have. 
In 2009, I had a business partner who was 6’
2” tall and weighed 220 pounds. He was in great shape. While I was at my desk
chomping on a burger and fries for lunch, trying to solve another engineering design
problem, he’d be working out at a fitness center, miles from our office. 
He was always trying to pull me out of my
chair and go to his gym. I wanted to get in shape, but I had little time,
inclination, or self-confidence to go to the gym. For me, working out was torture.
From time to time, I’d concede to go. The only way I would ever enjoy working
out was when I didn’t have to think about it, such as a competitive game. 
I tried water aerobics for a brief time
because of the extra resistance it provided without additional strain on my
body. But that didn’t do it for me, either. Boring.
I decided I’d try to lift weights at my
desk. I quickly realized I couldn’t use my computer and lift weights at the
same time. The weights just sat on the floor in the corner gathering dust. So I
looked for an alternative to weights. 
As a sci-fi and science buff, I’d always
been fascinated with gravity. Muscles are the biological way that we overcome
gravity. So, with this knowledge, and the science of increased resistance, repetitive
weight lifting, and water exercise, I came up with an idea and a design. I
began to construct my first prototype. In 2009 I filed for the first
patent using a prototype made of duct tape, lug nuts, painting sticks, and
other items that were readily available. 
Six years of experimentation and remodeling
have brought the Armore™ wearable arm exerciser and me to where we are today. 
With today’s knowledge that repetition is better than heavy weights,
I continue to build muscles and tendons without strain from heavy
weights.  And it turns out that there are many other benefits from this
type of exercise.  Increased endurance,
blood flow, and the general strengthening of the connective tissue and bone.
Compared to my early prototypes, the Armore™
wearable arm exerciser of today is very comfortable and made of quality
materials –– most of which weren’t available 20 years ago. The Armore™
exerciser I want to send to you is made of glass-infused nylon, a crank-down
device is made out of nickel, gaskets and washers made out of BUMA (a high tech
type of synthetic rubber for longevity and maximum friction), and neoprene
straps with Velcro fasteners. 
The Armore™ wearable arm exerciser weighs
only 7 ounces. It can be adjusted up to 50 pounds of resistance –– while you’re
sitting at your desk, grocery shopping, or watching TV. Every time you move,
you’re exercising! Order yours today. 
Take the Armore™ wearable
arm exerciser seriously
As you can imagine, I had a number of friends using the
Armore™ wearable arm exerciser during its development. My friends who were younger,
more athletic and muscular benefited even more than me from wearing it on a
regular basis. One of my friends confessed that he felt he was being “beat up”
by the Armore™ wearable arm exerciser because of the additional resistance during
his workout. His increased results were because he cranked the resistance to
max.  So much so, I was surprised he didn’t
break it! 
THE
SCIENCE
Here’s the science behind
the Armore™ wearable arm exerciser
Muscles
come in pairs. 
When one muscle of a pair contracts, its counterpart muscle contracts
and pulls in the opposite direction. Without this arrangement you wouldn't be
able to straighten your arm after lifting it.
When your biceps muscle in your upper arm contracts, it pulls
your lower arm in towards your shoulder. When it relaxes, your biceps can’t
push your arm back out. To do this, your triceps muscle, the muscles on the underneath
of your upper arm, contract to straighten your arm out. If your triceps muscle
wasn't there, your arm couldn’t straighten. You’d be unable to extend your arm.
My body builder friends look the way they do because of the amount of time, number of repetitions, and weight they lift and, of course, this works for them because of their strong commitment.  
Most of us, however, don’t have the time or that level of commitment. We just want to be healthy, keep our body in shape, and looking our best.  So how does one achieve this?   When you lift free weights or work out with commercial
fitness center equipment, the weight itself is what taxes the biceps and the triceps
muscles (one pulling, the other relaxing). The more the weight or resistance,
the greater the muscle strength needed to overcome it.  Adding resistance to your natural movement is how Armore™ wearable arm exerciser works.
Scientifically engineered and weighing in at only 7 ounces,
the Armore™ wearable arm exerciser provides similar results as lifting and
pushing free weights or using commercial fitness center equipment. 
But it does so in the most convenient way –– because you wear
it anywhere, anytime… and because it’s adjustable up to 50 pounds of
resistance. All you have to do is remember to put in on.  Every time you move,
you’re exercising!

What We Need & What You Get 
We’re
looking to raise $59,000. Your investment of $59.00 or more buys you two (2)
Armore™ wearable arm exercisers and earns you our most sincere gratitude.  
We’re
also looking to connect with fitness centers and trainers in the U.S. for beta
testing the Armore™ wearable arm exerciser in those environments. For an
investment of $290.00, we’ll send 10 Armore™ arm exerciser to a fitness center
or trainer. This would require some reporting, monitoring bicep size and muscle
tone, resolution of pain or reduction of the occurrence of pain on the part of
the fitness centers or trainers. We’d also be looking for testimonials from
those who are most successful with the arm exerciser. (It’s not complicated. Mostly,
success is based on frequency and consistency of wearing the exerciser.)  
If
we fail to reach our goal of $59,000, we’ll use those funds in two ways. First,
contribute to physiology research and use some funds for future R&D.
Second, while our ultimate goal is a full-body exoskeleton, our next step is a
knee exerciser. Some funds will be used for R&D in that regard. 


   The Impact 
Fitness.
Health. Mind-body balance. Personal wellbeing. They are priorities for many
Americans. The Armore™ wearable arm exerciser is a great solution for those who
want to stay in shape but are constantly on the go and don’t have or take the time
to maintain a regular fitness regimen. 
The
Armore™ wearable arm exerciser can do that. Our tests with prototypes showed an
average ¼ inch bicep growth per week for people who used the exerciser for
three 3 weeks. Athletes often added 4-times that, depending on amount of time
used.




Risks & Challenges  
With
30-plus years of experience as a developer, project manager, engineer, and
inventor, I know that things don’t always go as planned. 
While
there have been setbacks along the way in the development of the Armore™
wearable arm exerciser, each and every challenge was met and overcome. Three
reasons: I am a problem solver. I’m persistent as all get out. And it’s what
inventors do. We know there’s an answer. We just haven’t found it yet.

Bluvos is a natural alternative to energy drinks that also provides a boost in mental performance!
Bluvos is a naturally derived energy supplement in pill form designed to temporarily Enhance Cognitive Performance, Sharpen Mental Focus and Boost Energy. 

We have changed our packaging to a 30 count bottle instead of the 10 count blister pack. Which means more bang for your buck! 

For anyone who orders:
2 Pack (20 capsules) - You will receive - 1 bottle (30 capsules) 
4 Pack (40 capsules) - You will receive - 2 bottles (60 capsules)
8 Pack (80 capsules) - You will receive - 4 bottles (120 capsules)
You'll never see Bluvos at these highly discounted prices again! You only have a few more days to purchase! 
Here is a rendering of what the bottles will look like! 




We created Bluvos with gamers in mind. As players ourselves, we understand the significant amount of focus and energy required to perform at a top level during intense gaming sessions. We hand-picked ingredients with specific qualities to create a potent, healthy and effective energy formula.





The idea for Bluvos began with our interest in supplements that enhance energy as well as mental focus and ability. We were curious whether the concepts in movies such as Limitless and Lucy, where individuals activate greater cognitive abilities through supplements, had any practical value? It is through such curiosity that our research brought us to learn about Nootropics, naturally occurring substances that have been shown to enhance cognitive function.


After years of relying on countless energy drinks to keep us alert during our gaming sessions and everyday life, we realized there had to be a better alternative. We realized there were no mainstream energy products that also contained nootropics as an all-in-one energy/cognitive improving solution. Thus, Bluvos was born. We have worked with professionals in the industry to create carefully designed, safe and effective formula to boost energy and focus. Furthermore, we chose to utilize capsules instead of beverages in an effort to eliminate unnecessary sugars, preservatives and flavours that are often found in energy drinks. We use veggie capsules (cellulose) because they are a healthy alternative to the standard gelatin pill capsules.


Bluvos improves upon typical energy products in several ways:


1) By designing Bluvos in pill form, we eliminate the harmful sugars, flavorings and preservatives found in most energy products, while still keeping the full focus and energizing effect!
2) The herb Rhodiola actually helps to relieve mental fatigue, keeping you clear and refreshed.
3) Now that you're feeling energized and refreshed, the Nootropics kick in to enhance cognitive function, providing a mental boost in ADDITION to energy. This is why we call it ""Smart Energy"".



Merriam Webster defines Nootropics as:

""a substance that enhances cognition and memory and facilitates learning."" 

In order to be classified as a true Nootropic, a substance must be approved as safe for human consumption. No, you did not read that wrong. Nootropics are classified as a harmless substance that can actually improve brain function! We added Nootropics so that Bluvos can help your brain kick into overdrive - so you can call that early GG with confidence.

The main difference between Bluvos and the majority of Nootropic products on the market is that all of our ingredients can be found in nature. Many of the other Nootropic ""stacks"" contain certain man-made ingredients. In addition, our claims have been reviewed by a governmental agency (Health Canada). Very few supplements have ever been reviewed which makes Bluvos a rare product in the energy supplements market.






Bluvos compliments any gamer’s arsenal by keeping them attentive and alert, as well as providing a mental edge. A slight boost in performance can help you carry games further and could be the difference between victory and defeat. Removing your focus for even a split second at the wrong time could cost you a valuable game or get you killed! The carefully selected ingredients in Bluvos work to ensure that your attention never leaves the screen, and keeps you in the zone for extended sessions.







We designed Bluvos with gamers in mind.. However, anyone who requires focus and energy can benefit from Bluvos! We have had so much positive feedback from people in all walks of life; from athletes, to students, to entrepreneurs; from truck drivers, cyclists, nurses, blue collar workers, and the list goes on! Bluvos truly is the healthy future of personal energy!










We worked with professionals in the industry to create the perfect formula for what we wanted from Bluvos. After dozens of revisions, we finally settled on this balanced blend of energy, herbs, nootropics and vitamins:








Gaming is a professional sport now - it should have its own supplements! Look at bodybuilding 20 years ago, there was nothing. Now it is a multi-billion dollar industry.





We really want to grow WITH the gaming community – that is why we plan to sponsor eSports teams, tournaments and twitch/ YouTube streamers. 


We feel that eSports are experiencing a massive growth phase. Where 10 years ago gaming was somewhat frowned upon, now it's becoming a way of life, a source of income and a way to connect with friends (old and new) and we are really excited to help fuel the revolution!




















Q: How long do the effects of Bluvos last?
A: Generally 4-6 hours. Results can vary person to person.

Q: Can I take Bluvos with coffee?
A: Of course! We would never ask someone to give up coffee.
Q: Will Bluvos cause me to crash after it wears off?
A: We have had no reported feedback of a crash! This is (most likely) because there is no sugar.
Q: Is Bluvos just for gaming or can I use it in other activities?
A: You can use Bluvos for anything that requires Energy and Focus!
Q: Why did you create Bluvos?
A: We wanted a product that we could use safely every day, that was healthy and would boost energy/ focus. We personally didn’t drink energy drinks because they made us feel sick, and there was nothing on the market that provided clean energy with a cognitive boost. 
Q: What are Nootropics and why are they in Bluvos?
A: Nootropics are a class of substance that boost cognitive function. We added Nootropics to Bluvos so that it would provide a Cognitive Boost as well as Energy!
Q: How much Bluvos can I safely consume in a day?
A: We recommend 2 pills daily. Some people find that 1 pill is enough!
Q: Will your pills be blue?
A: Yes, we are working on finding a natural blue dye for our capsules!Q: Does Bluvos have any side effects with my medical condition and/or medication?

A: We have chosen ingredients that generally have a low chance of causing ill effects with medical conditions. However, it's important to always consult with a healthcare provider before taking any dietary supplements.

We have been able to obtain small batch manufacturing for our samples.We need to raise enough for large scale batch manufacturing, to help us order our first big round of Bluvos!

<p>The City of Toledo Ohio was forced to
shut down it municipal water system for several days last summer because of
toxic algae blooms.  Some 500,000 people were without usable drinking
water.  The situation created panic and instances of civil unrest. 
These blooms were caused by phosphorus run-off into the lake.</p>
<p><b><span>If
the problem is not corrected quickly, we will continue to lose our drinking

<p>The government has stepped in and dictated mandates,
rules, and regulations requiring clean-up without providing guidance or common
sense solutions. Government has placed the burden on us through taxes and user
fees to resolve the situation without providing solutions.  </p>
<p>The government has gone further by dictating draconian
rules and regulations to farmers without providing any support for our farming
community.  Our famers have been left to deal
with their portion of the problem on their own. 
Our farmers are in a “no win” situation.  They are doing more than anyone
to resolve their part of the problem.  Unfortunately agriculture and our farmers
are being blamed for the entire problem.

<h4>
<b>Our farmers are our strongest environmental
stewards</b>. </h4>
<p>No one works harder to maintain a
healthy environment than our farmers. 
Without a healthy environment, they can’t produce the quantities and
quality of food we expect.  Without a
healthy environment, farmers don’t have jobs.  Without a healthy environment,
farmers will lose the way of life that they love.</p>
<p><b>What most people don’t realize is that animal
manure is nature’s highly effective fertilizer.  </b>Animal manure contains the essential
nutrients necessary to grow the food we need. 
It is also the most inexpensive fertilizer that farmers can use.  Unfortunately many farms have too much phosphorus and are now, or soon will be
prevented from using their animal manure as a fertilizer and will have to find
some way to dispose of it.  The majority of our farmers has no other outlet.</p>
<h4><b>We are all Environmental Advocates</b></h4>
<p>We are all environmentalists,
advocates and stewards of the environment. 
We all want clean water but also the products and food that phosphorus
produces.  In advocating for our
environment, we do so without the benefit of knowing how to remove and recover
the phosphorus that enters our waterways.  So we have to find ways to provide the
food and products we want and need while removing and recovering phosphorus and
eliminating it from running into our waterways. </p>

<h1><br/></h1>
<h1>The Solution</h1>
<p>I'm Chris Haug, CEO of Triea Technologies - and I'm on a
personal and professional mission to help solve the phosphorus pollution
problem in the agriculture industry, to support our farmers, help them prosper,
continue to expand food production, and protect their way of life. </p>
<p><b>The good news is that
this problem can be solved quickly using technology. Triea Technologies has a
process called Agra-NRS™, the <i>Phosphorus Pollution Solution.</i></b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">             </span></p>

<p><b>Our process</b>
<b>removes and recovers 90+% of the phosphorus from all forms of animal manure,
creates three highly valuable products for the farmer,</b> <b>and produces near
zero waste.  </b></p>
<p><b>Agra-NRS™ provides an immediate
solution to the agriculture contribution to the phosphorus pollution problem. </b></p>
<p><b>Our process doesn’t solve all of the
phosphorus issues.  It is specifically
focused on the agriculture industry.  It
is a highly powerful tool that will help farmers continue to be the top
stewards of our environment and make it easier for them to continue to do what
they do best.</b>
</p>
<p><span>When our Agra-NRS™ process is coupled
with existing nutrient management tools, we will start to correct the phosphorus
pollution problem immediately and in years instead of decades. </span></p>
<p><b>Agra-NRS™ is a win for everyone</b>.  Everyone wins because
we get all of the benefits that reduced phosphorus pollution provides while
continuing to receive the food at prices we expect. </p>

<h3><b>How much manure are we talking about?</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>The U.S. agriculture industry
produces about 9 billion animals (poultry, swine, cattle, and lamb), producing
approximately 1.6 billion tons of manure annually. This manure contains
approximately 112 billion pounds (56 million tons) of phosphorus <b>EVERY YEAR</b>.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The average U.S. farm produces
approximately 1,275 tons of manure per year that contains about 89,250 pounds
(approximately 45 tons) of phosphorus. The
Agra-NRS™ will remove and recover 90+% of this phosphorus - meaning we will
recover 80,000 pounds (40 tons) of phosphorus each year.</span><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul>
</ul>
<div>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(53, 114, 163); font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435155405/eynqsjvw7qnvjggrmrdo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>What products are produced by Agra-NRS?</h3>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Our process produces three highly
valuable products.</span><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Calcium phosphate.  </b>Calcium phosphate is one of the most widely used chemicals
in all forms of manufacturing in the U.S.  Everything from fertilizer, to
fillers, food additives, medical and dental products, and general manufacturing
needs it.  There is a large and growing market for this product.</p>
<p><b>Low or no phosphorus manure solids.</b>  Because the Agra-NRS™ process removes and recovers
90+% of the phosphorus in animal manure, the remaining solids can be land
applied and used as a fertilizer without the worry of compliance with
regulations.  The solids can also be composted and used or sold as a high
quality mulch and soil amendment.</p>
<p><b>Low or no phosphorus enriched liquid
fertilizer.</b>  The wash water used in the
process is recycled many times.  In the recycling, the nitrogen and
potassium removed with the phosphorus becomes concentrated.  When we are done with the wash water, the
farmer can use it as an enriched nitrogen/potassium fertilizer which will
replace a significant amount of fertilizer the farmer has to purchase to
provide these nutrients.  The farmer can
also choose to sell this liquid to others and generate additional income.</p>
<p><b>How will our system be used?</b></p>
<p>There are four ways that the
Agra-NRS™ will be put into the field:</p>
<p>First is to put our system on farms
where there is enough volume of manure to justify it.</p>
<p>Second<span>,
build mobile platforms that will go farm to farm for those farms that don’t
have sufficient manure volume to justify an on-farm system.</span></p>
<p>Three, where possible, build area-wide
or regional systems where the manure comes to us for processing.</p>
<p>Finally, connect the Agra-NRS™
process to manure-to-energy processes and extract the phosphorus prior to
generating energy.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Is the Agra-NRS™ process ready to go?</b></p>
<p>Yes, we are ready to move into the real world.  The process has been proven and we have conducted as much laboratory commercialization work as we can.  We now need large, farm scale systems to identify and solve problems that simply can’t be done in the lab. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(53, 114, 163); font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
<h1><b>Recyclable Resource</b></h1>
<p></p>
<p>The big benefit and beauty of
Triea's Agra-NRS™ process is that it recovers phosphorus in a form the makes it
a highly recyclable resource.  The U.S. consumes approximately 45 million
tons of raw phosphorus rock each year.  2 million tons come from mining in
the U.S.  The balance comes from
imports.  Right now, none of this phosphorus is recovered and
recycled.  When the Agra-NRS™ process is fully implemented, we will
recover about 67% of the phosphorus we consume.  This means that our recovered phosphorus would
replace a significant amount of mined phosphorus.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(53, 114, 163); font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
<h1>Why Indiegogo?</h1>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Several reasons.  First, we are under so much pressure to get
our Agra-NRS™ process into the field that we simply aren't willing and can't
wait for traditional capital sources.  Banks and traditional investors are
highly conservative and take an incredible amount of time to make a decision.  We have too much important work to do to help
our farmers and the environment to wait for traditional capital sources to come
through.  </p>
<p>We believe that crowdfunding through
Indiegogo is the quickest and most efficient way of raising the funds we need
to get our systems operational and do so as quickly as possible. </p>
<p>In addition, we are not just looking
to raise money, we are looking to build and grow a true grass roots movement
that recognizes the problem and wants to be part of the solution.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2><b>How much money are looking to raise?</b></h2>
<p></p>
<p>Our minimum goal is $500,000.  However, we want to raise as much as
possible.  $500,000 will help us design,
construct, and operate two full-scale on-farm systems.  With two systems, we will be able to remove
and recover about 175,000 pounds of phosphorus (88 tons) per year.  This
is a great start.  We would love to raise
as much as $1,500,000.  This gives us the
ability to put as many as 6 systems on farm and recover about 550,000 pounds of
phosphorus (275 tons) per year. </p>
<p>In addition, crowdfunding is our way
to do well for the environment and build a grass roots movement to solve a
major environmental problem. </p>

<h1>Successes &amp; Support</h1>
<p></p>
<p>About two years ago, we realized the extent of the
phosphorus pollution problem.  I saw the
parallels between my education and prior work in environmental pollution
control and began researching potential technologies that could offer tangible
solutions.  Based on my work, and
educational experience (BS in Environmental Science / minor Environmental
Chemistry) at Purdue University, I realized that I had worked with similar
technologies while working in the pollution control industry with Nalco
Chemical Company. </p>
<p>I assembled a group of scientists, engineers, and business
development professionals to research and analyze the options.  We found what we consider to be the best
technology for the agriculture industry - which is now the Agra-NRS™
system.  To move development forward as
quickly as possible, we applied and were awarded, a $250,000 grant from the
Maryland Department of Natural Resources to take the base technology and do the R&amp;D necessary to get to commercialization.  We partnered with Dr. Lee Blaney, professor
in the School of Chemical, Biochemical, and Environmental Engineering at the
University of Maryland - Baltimore County to conduct the research.  We found
that the lab results produced better results than we had anticipated.  With that, we began commercialization work which
brings us to today.  The next step is to put systems on farms and begin
processing manure. </p>
<p>To do so, we have conducted an extensive marketing and
public relations campaign to inform and educate the industry and industry
stakeholders.  As a result, the following is a partial list of those that have

</div></div>","We are facing a major environmental catastrophe!






Our waterways are suffering from frequent and growing toxic algae blooms caused by phosphorus pollution.  These blooms create significant dead zones, kill our fish and seafood supplies, and contaminate our water supplies.  

How big is the problem? 
All 50 States and more than 80% of our waterways, especially the Great Lakes, Mississippi River Basin, the Everglades, and the Chesapeake Bay watersheds  are suffering this problem and it's getting worse. 



The City of Toledo Ohio was forced to
shut down it municipal water system for several days last summer because of
toxic algae blooms.  Some 500,000 people were without usable drinking
water.  The situation created panic and instances of civil unrest. 
These blooms were caused by phosphorus run-off into the lake.
If
the problem is not corrected quickly, we will continue to lose our drinking
water supplies, our fish and seafood, and experience significantly higher food
prices.


Why is phosphorus a big deal?

Phosphorus
is critical for every biological and manufacturing process on earth.  Without it, nothing will live.  Phosphors is
essential in everything we use and consume.  Without it, we would not exist.

Who's at fault?
We all are.
Excess phosphorus comes from everywhere, industry, power
plants, municipal waste treatment, storm water run-off, real estate
development, and agriculture, just to
name a few.



The government has stepped in and dictated mandates,
rules, and regulations requiring clean-up without providing guidance or common
sense solutions. Government has placed the burden on us through taxes and user
fees to resolve the situation without providing solutions.  
The government has gone further by dictating draconian
rules and regulations to farmers without providing any support for our farming
community.  Our famers have been left to deal
with their portion of the problem on their own. 
Our farmers are in a “no win” situation.  They are doing more than anyone
to resolve their part of the problem.  Unfortunately agriculture and our farmers
are being blamed for the entire problem. 
This is completely false and
totally untrue.



Our farmers are our strongest environmental
stewards. 
No one works harder to maintain a
healthy environment than our farmers. 
Without a healthy environment, they can’t produce the quantities and
quality of food we expect.  Without a
healthy environment, farmers don’t have jobs.  Without a healthy environment,
farmers will lose the way of life that they love.
What most people don’t realize is that animal
manure is nature’s highly effective fertilizer.  Animal manure contains the essential
nutrients necessary to grow the food we need. 
It is also the most inexpensive fertilizer that farmers can use.  Unfortunately many farms have too much phosphorus and are now, or soon will be
prevented from using their animal manure as a fertilizer and will have to find
some way to dispose of it.  The majority of our farmers has no other outlet.
We are all Environmental Advocates
We are all environmentalists,
advocates and stewards of the environment. 
We all want clean water but also the products and food that phosphorus
produces.  In advocating for our
environment, we do so without the benefit of knowing how to remove and recover
the phosphorus that enters our waterways.  So we have to find ways to provide the
food and products we want and need while removing and recovering phosphorus and
eliminating it from running into our waterways. 

What can we
do about the situation?

What is needed is a common sense technology that will remove
and recover phosphorus at the source so that it never makes it into our
waterways.

The Solution
I'm Chris Haug, CEO of Triea Technologies - and I'm on a
personal and professional mission to help solve the phosphorus pollution
problem in the agriculture industry, to support our farmers, help them prosper,
continue to expand food production, and protect their way of life. 
The good news is that
this problem can be solved quickly using technology. Triea Technologies has a
process called Agra-NRS™, the Phosphorus Pollution Solution.             


                                
Our process
removes and recovers 90+% of the phosphorus from all forms of animal manure,
creates three highly valuable products for the farmer, and produces near
zero waste.  
Agra-NRS™ provides an immediate
solution to the agriculture contribution to the phosphorus pollution problem. 
Our process doesn’t solve all of the
phosphorus issues.  It is specifically
focused on the agriculture industry.  It
is a highly powerful tool that will help farmers continue to be the top
stewards of our environment and make it easier for them to continue to do what
they do best.

When our Agra-NRS™ process is coupled
with existing nutrient management tools, we will start to correct the phosphorus
pollution problem immediately and in years instead of decades. 
Agra-NRS™ is a win for everyone.  Everyone wins because
we get all of the benefits that reduced phosphorus pollution provides while
continuing to receive the food at prices we expect. 

EVERY POUND OF PHOSPHORUS WE REMOVE AND
RECOVER IS A POUND THAT WILL NEVER ENTER OUR WATERWAYS.

How much manure are we talking about?

The U.S. agriculture industry
produces about 9 billion animals (poultry, swine, cattle, and lamb), producing
approximately 1.6 billion tons of manure annually. This manure contains
approximately 112 billion pounds (56 million tons) of phosphorus EVERY YEAR.
The average U.S. farm produces
approximately 1,275 tons of manure per year that contains about 89,250 pounds
(approximately 45 tons) of phosphorus. The
Agra-NRS™ will remove and recover 90+% of this phosphorus - meaning we will
recover 80,000 pounds (40 tons) of phosphorus each year.









What products are produced by Agra-NRS?
Our process produces three highly
valuable products.


Calcium phosphate.  Calcium phosphate is one of the most widely used chemicals
in all forms of manufacturing in the U.S.  Everything from fertilizer, to
fillers, food additives, medical and dental products, and general manufacturing
needs it.  There is a large and growing market for this product.
Low or no phosphorus manure solids.  Because the Agra-NRS™ process removes and recovers
90+% of the phosphorus in animal manure, the remaining solids can be land
applied and used as a fertilizer without the worry of compliance with
regulations.  The solids can also be composted and used or sold as a high
quality mulch and soil amendment.
Low or no phosphorus enriched liquid
fertilizer.  The wash water used in the
process is recycled many times.  In the recycling, the nitrogen and
potassium removed with the phosphorus becomes concentrated.  When we are done with the wash water, the
farmer can use it as an enriched nitrogen/potassium fertilizer which will
replace a significant amount of fertilizer the farmer has to purchase to
provide these nutrients.  The farmer can
also choose to sell this liquid to others and generate additional income.
How will our system be used?
There are four ways that the
Agra-NRS™ will be put into the field:
First is to put our system on farms
where there is enough volume of manure to justify it.
Second,
build mobile platforms that will go farm to farm for those farms that don’t
have sufficient manure volume to justify an on-farm system.
Three, where possible, build area-wide
or regional systems where the manure comes to us for processing.
Finally, connect the Agra-NRS™
process to manure-to-energy processes and extract the phosphorus prior to
generating energy.

Is the Agra-NRS™ process ready to go?
Yes, we are ready to move into the real world.  The process has been proven and we have conducted as much laboratory commercialization work as we can.  We now need large, farm scale systems to identify and solve problems that simply can’t be done in the lab. 

Recyclable Resource

The big benefit and beauty of
Triea's Agra-NRS™ process is that it recovers phosphorus in a form the makes it
a highly recyclable resource.  The U.S. consumes approximately 45 million
tons of raw phosphorus rock each year.  2 million tons come from mining in
the U.S.  The balance comes from
imports.  Right now, none of this phosphorus is recovered and
recycled.  When the Agra-NRS™ process is fully implemented, we will
recover about 67% of the phosphorus we consume.  This means that our recovered phosphorus would
replace a significant amount of mined phosphorus.

Why Indiegogo?


Several reasons.  First, we are under so much pressure to get
our Agra-NRS™ process into the field that we simply aren't willing and can't
wait for traditional capital sources.  Banks and traditional investors are
highly conservative and take an incredible amount of time to make a decision.  We have too much important work to do to help
our farmers and the environment to wait for traditional capital sources to come
through.  
We believe that crowdfunding through
Indiegogo is the quickest and most efficient way of raising the funds we need
to get our systems operational and do so as quickly as possible. 
In addition, we are not just looking
to raise money, we are looking to build and grow a true grass roots movement
that recognizes the problem and wants to be part of the solution.

How much money are looking to raise?

Our minimum goal is $500,000.  However, we want to raise as much as
possible.  $500,000 will help us design,
construct, and operate two full-scale on-farm systems.  With two systems, we will be able to remove
and recover about 175,000 pounds of phosphorus (88 tons) per year.  This
is a great start.  We would love to raise
as much as $1,500,000.  This gives us the
ability to put as many as 6 systems on farm and recover about 550,000 pounds of
phosphorus (275 tons) per year. 
In addition, crowdfunding is our way
to do well for the environment and build a grass roots movement to solve a
major environmental problem. 
YOU
RECEIVED A GRANT, WHY DO YOU NEED MORE MONEY?
The grant, $250,000, was from the Maryland Department of Natural Services and
was for the sole purpose of funding our laboratory research and development of
the process.  This includes verifying the
basic chemistry and physics and begin to develop a commercial system in a
laboratory environment so we can identify and resolve as many problems as
possible before we move into the field. 
The grant does not include money for in-field R & D or an on-farm
system.
We need the money to move from the laboratory to on-farm systems in order to
begin to verify our laboratory results, work out normal glitches  and issues that can only be done in the field,
and begin recovering phosphorus in the process.

sources.  We have attempted to cross
reference and corroborate all of our data.  
Here is a link to Agra-NRS™  literature for additional data.   


How will I get
updates?

Our plan is to post regular updates on our progress on our
website, http://www.agranrs.com.   We also are planning to send
out personal electronic messages on a quarterly basis to each of our
contributors that will provide complete updates on our progress.  Once we have the system installed on site, we
will make a video of the start-up and post it to our website for all to see.

Additional Contact
Information
You can always contact me personally at chris@agranrs.com.  Depending on the volume of messages, I will
do my best to respond within 48 hours of receipt.  You can also call me at 866-620-9245.

<h3><b style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">Q: ARE THE DIY RECIPES EASY TO MAKE?</b></h3>
<div>
<p><b>A: </b><span>Yes! We specifically chose recipes that require minimal effort but still deliver spectacular results. No oven or stove is required. In addition to the how-to instructions included in your cube, you may visit our YouTube channel for easy<span>follow along videos posted on the 10th day of each month.</span></span></p>
<p><b>Q: WHAT KIND OF INGREDIENTS CAN I EXPECT?</b></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Only the best kind. We choose our ingredients based on their natural healing and restorative properties. When it comes to body care we believe that less is more. That’s why we choose our ingredients in their most natural state – organic &amp; raw.</p>
<p><span>A few of our favorites are: Himalayan Sea Salt, Jojoba Oil, Coconut Oil, Rosehip Oil, Marigold, Aloe Vera, Vitamin E, Activated Charcoal, Apple Cider Vinegar, Beeswax, and a long list of aromatherapeutic essential oils like Lavender, Sandalwood, Ylang Ylang, Rosemary, and Bergamot. </span></p>
<p><strong>Q: ARE YOUR PRODUCTS VEGAN?</strong></p>
<p><b>A:</b> Some are while others are not. Please read the project details to find out if a DIY product is vegan. The only non-vegan ingredient we use (and love) is honey! Raw honey (honey that hasn’t been pasteurized or heated) is full of antioxidants &amp; enzymes to slow down aging as well as boost your complexion. It’s also a humectant, which means it attracts and retains moisturizer. Honey’s antibacterial properties prevent and treat acne by eliminating the bacteria that causes it. Also, honey never spoils. SAVE THE BEES! </p>
<p><b>Q: HOW DO I KNOW THESE PRODUCTS WILL WORK? <b>ARE YOU DOCTORS?</b></b></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Nope. We’re just sisters who come from a long line of homeopathic remedies and natural ways to care for yourself. Our 77 year old grandmothers don’t look a day over 60 and we’ve been calling our dad the Witch Doctor since ’95.</p>
<p>We create all of these recipes in our own kitchen before sharing them with you. They’re based on our own knowledge and research of natural ingredients. There’s no guarantee that anything in life “will work” but we’re confident that your skin will love naturally nutrient-rich products more than it loves the toxic ones you’re putting on your body now.</p>

<p><b>Q: WHY SHOULD I SIGN UP FOR THE CRAFTY CUBE WHEN I CAN BUY MY OWN INGREDIENTS FROM THE STORE?</b></p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> For the same reasons you go out to eat even though you probably know how to cook.

You don't have to search for information or wonder why your body scrub or face wash contains a certain ingredient. Our how-to recipes are packed with helpful information.</p>

“Would you put Teflon on your face? Did you know some anti-aging creams & face powders use the same chemical that creates a nonstick surface on cookware to create a smooth finish to makeups & lotions? That’s a recipe for concern, because of a potential contaminant of PTFE called perfluorooctonoic acid (PFOA). PFOA is a toxic chemical linked to cancer, endocrine disruption & reproductive harm. PTFE is the same chemical known by the trade name Teflon.”

We grew up with holistic and homeopathic skincare remedies. Our parents taught us to feed our skin nature’s nutrients with ingredients we can pronounce in their most natural state – ORGANIC & RAW.

We are currently engaging in this fundraising campaign to raise awareness about our line, raise capital for our planned expansion into retail stores and recruit future representatives and employees to meet the needs of that expansion. We have a clear and open shot at bringing our products into some high profile retail locations.</p><p>TheHempStars is a small company that has been given a big opportunity. We have been selling over the internet and in small roadshows. Now we have been asked to give a presentation in front of several of the largest warehouses in America as well as a professional sales organization.</p><p>With the funds that are raised we will be able to produce and share our product throughout the country! Our quality hand-made organic hemp products are exceedingly nourishing when consumed either orally or transdermally.

We are currently working as a two man team making each and every product by hand. I, Joseph Hickey, have been in charge of the company’s web presence, marketing, and investor relationships.In just a year, we have been able to produce well over 20 products with another 100 under development and are able to ship across the United States any product ordered online. We are currently engaging in this fundraising campaign to raise awareness about our line, raise capital for our planned expansion into retail stores and recruit future representatives and employees to meet the needs of that expansion. We have a clear and open shot at bringing our products into some high profile retail locations.TheHempStars is a small company that has been given a big opportunity.

<p>I am flipping and re-purposing a 1987 Fleetwood Bounder Motorhome to in order to bring people wellness ""on wheels"" via massage therapy.  </p>
<p>The idea is to provide a unique therapeutic experience, where you can slip away from your everyday activities, and fully immerse yourself amongst beauty, comfort, and personalized attention in a Zen environment—an environment that we bring to you.</p>
<p>Many independent massage therapists are mobile and have the ability to travel to clients, events, and businesses; however may lack the physical environment that goes hand in hand with a spa, by only having on hand the basic atmospherics such as a massage table or chairs, and items they can physically carry in order to not be worn out before the session(s) begin. If they're lucky the location in which they are practicing massage is free of distraction--such as people walking around, people watchers, and loud music from an expo, party, or farmer's market.  While great exposure to potential clients, it can also take away from the current client's overall experience by maintaining a personalized experience in a privatized setting.</p>
<p>Additional advantages for the clients are, the modalities to be offered between overall wellness and relaxation to therapeutic bodywork in a spa like atmosphere without the hassle of travel, taking time off from work, and making space for an at-home or on-site massage therapist at small office, non-profit, college campus, or wedding party!</p>
<p>It is also practical, innovative and rewarding experience to provide for teachers, and employee appreciation -- not to mention those involved in physically demanding activities such as military service members, first responders, athletes and dancers/fine arts participants.</p>
<h2><strong>Short Summary</strong></h2>
<p>The concept of this mobile massage practice came to me in January 2017. The start up cost was low and pretty doable, so I ran with it.</p>
<p>After all the food truck trends, mobile pet grooming, and car detailing services. I said, WHY NOT!?</p>
<p>A few months prior I was looking into buying a townhouse in Tampa FL, and was adamant that it had enough rooms so I could dedicate one for personal wellness. -- a room for meditation, prayer, something that made all the stresses of my day go away, some place for relaxation and rejuvenation. A place where I could even have a dedicated massage therapist come to me.</p>
<p>At that moment I also realized that the room could also be utilized as my own in-home massage practice. The healing of mind, body, and soul was something I was passionate about but never really pursued.</p>
<p>Long story short, things fell through with the townhouse BUT they HADN’T fallen through with the idea. It morphed and even though I could not have my <i>physical</i> wellness room, I <i>could</i> have wellness on wheels and thus reach out to an even larger market and community. So I bought an RV from a wonderful couple who did missionary work with only 40,000 miles on it, and enrolled in a 7 month licensing program for massage therapy at Cortiva Institute.</p>
<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>Of course traveling to people's homes with an RV can be fairly inefficient due to time and gas, which is one of the reasons, I feel this masseuse-mobile will have it's biggest impact being parked in high- foot traffic zones such as military bases, downtown, business districts, parks, convention centers, and college campuses.</p>
<p>The plan is to launch The Masseuse Mobile in fall of 2017 once I receive my massage therapist license. The holiday season is the perfect time to de-stress and give back to your employees, teachers, first responders, military members, veterans, senior citizens, community organizations and even students cramming for those final exams.</p>
<p>My way to say thank to any investments will be complementary sessions equivalent to the amount given. The goal set to $25,000, is enough to give it the unique and chic spa experience I want to provide to my guests outside of basic upgrades including, but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Outdoor touch screen for booking appointments and displaying wait times</li>
<li>Indoor iPads for medical intake forms and session customization</li>
<li>Upgrades for the bathroom fixtures</li>
<li>Any physical changes to the interior, such as kitchen tiling</li>
<li>AND - Here’s the fun part—Wrapping the vehicle and having it PROFESSIONALLY designed</li>
<li>Installing Solar Panels for efficiency</li>
<li>And my favorite, the electric InkBed</li>
</ul>
<p>The newly patented electric ink bed provides a more beneficial experience to corporate and event chair massage by making parts of the body more accessible that would not normally be worked, but also gives the option to recline the client both prone and supine as not to take away from the overall experience of have to readjust mid-session.</p>
<p>Of course the more money raised, the more vehicles we are able to flip and the more therapists we can hire to not only maintain current clientele, but also increase it! This would allow us to meet the demand throughout the community and beyond...Additionally, donating a set of sessions to a community organization is a great way to say thank you!</p>
<p>Who knows, The Masseuse Mobile may be coming soon to a city near you ;)</p>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<h3>Corporate Massage</h3>
<p>Data from the American Productivity Audit, found that in a survey of nearly 30,000 people, thousands were losing productive time due to headache, arthritis, back pain, and an assortment of other musculoskeletal conditions.</p>
<p>Overall, the survey found that workers lost an average of 4.6 hours per week of productive time due to a pain condition; and age, believe it or not, was not a factor!</p>
<p>Because we live in a world where time is money, the America Productivity Audit took their study a step further and equated the amount of time lost to be equivalent to 61.2 BILLION dollars, not just by absenteeism but reduced work performance by 76.6%.</p>
<p>It's no wonder corporations and small businesses are putting a larger emphasis on the wellness of their employees! Reserving a massage therapist once a week to come their place of work can cost as little as $15/person. That's a huge return and it shows your employees that you care.</p>
<h3>Massage for PTSD and Emotional Release</h3>
<p>Giving back to the community and serving those who have served or gone through a traumatic event is important to me, so not only is this a fund for flipping but an opportunity to serve those who may not be able to afford it, or don't have time, and simply truly need it. Which is why I set up this campaign with the ability for contributors to donate sessions to organizations (non-profits, treatment centers, VA centers, etc.).</p>
<p>Massage Therapy is a holistic way of approaching Post Traumatic Stress Disorder by providing both physical and health benefits without any of the harmful side effects that medication may have. The best way to short-circuit these endless trauma effects is to treat the traumatized mind, emotions and body as a whole.</p>
<p>In Western medicine, the symptoms of PTSD are the result of chemical imbalances in the brain triggered by emotional stress that affect behavior, feelings and cognition. By reliving the traumatic event, the brain is unable to turn off the “Fight or Flight” response, and thus constantly flooding their bodies with stress hormones that cause not only emotional, but physical pain, as the muscles are constantly tensed for action.</p>
<p>Massage therapy can not only relax tensed muscles and ease the physical pain; they can trigger the body’s relaxation response, ultimately breaking the cycle of fight or flight. Providing a massage experience with a 'mobile wellness center provides the full 'zen' experience and allows you to not have to worry about inviting the therapist into your home, essentially making the full experience available in a mobile format!</p>
<h3>Massage for Healthcare</h3>
<p>According to the American Massage Therapy Association, people spend between $4 billion and $6 billion annually on massage therapy and make 114 million visits each year.</p>
<p>In fact, studies show 27 percent of adults in the United States report having massages in the past five years. That’s a little over one in four. Not bad, but once every five years, or even once a year is NOT enough. That's like working out for a year while constantly eating junk food the rest.</p>
<p>Most people think massage is a luxury or just for athletes, but in reality it is a therapeutic need that aids our Mind, Body, AND Soul.  </p>
<ul>
<li>71% of consumers agree that massage therapy should be considered a form of healthcare</li>
<li>Over 50% of people have received a massage for other reasons other than relaxation. And were often referred by their physicians, chiropractors, or physical therapists for:<ul>
<li>headaches &amp; migraines</li>
<li>pregnancy</li>
<li>stiffness or spasms</li>
<li>circulatory problems</li>
<li>neuromuscular issues (numbness, tingling)</li>
<li>cancer</li>
<li>digestive problems</li>
<li>injury recovery or rehabilitation</li>
<li>anxiety</li>
<li>insomnia</li>
<li>basic disease control</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So many different treatments for massage therapy, that insurance agencies are beginning to include massage as preventative healthcare option!</p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>480.046(1)(n) Grounds for disciplinary action by the board include ""practicing massage at a site, location, or place which is not duly licensed as a massage establishment, except that a massage therapist, as provided by rules adopted by the board, may provide massage services, excluding colonic irrigation, at the residence of a client, at the office of the client, at a sports event, at a convention, or at a trade show.</p>
<p>**For events, fairs, conventions, permission must be obtained by the event manager or property owner.</p>
<p>In other words you can't just set up shop in a parking lot, one must have written permission. For example, I cannot just set up at the Tampa Convention Center and wait for attendees to come out for a massage, it must be a pre-coordinated and synergistic effort -- and that always works out better for everyone.</p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>If you can't contribute, there are still ways to make sure that this masseuse mobile get's out on the road and reaches those who need it most! One of those ways is sharing with your friends and family, and even more so community partners and the businesses you work for. Simply inviting us to your office of employment allows your co-workers, clients and guests the ability to receive and pay for services individually without reserving actual office funds.</p>
<p>Also, referrals for the upgrades and installments allow me to make contacts I might not have known I have in the industry (i.e. auto paint and body shops, solar panel installers, electricians, software designers, etc!)</p>

<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: Why is Snowfox Trackerphone not available for my country?</b><p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p>A: Snowfox Trackerphone has an inbuilt SIM card module, and we need to set up the connectivity for each country or region separately. The devices will work in many countries, however, we want to provide our customers with local call-in numbers. </p>
<p>This means we need to take the global rollout step-by-step.  The best way to make sure your country gets Snowfox Trackerphone faster is to contribute to our campaign with a supporter perk and share our campaign in social media.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Q: Why does Snowfox Trackerphone require a monthly subscription?</b></p>
<p>A: Snowfox Trackerphone is no different from phones. There are both data and voice calls available, so we need to use the mobile networks to get the service working. We have put a lot of extra effort to make the taking-into-use and continuous usage effort free for our customers. From pricing point of view we believe the cost to be competitive when compared to getting a smartphone for your child.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Q: How do I make calls with Snowfox?</b></p>
<p>A: The kid presses the button on Snowfox Trackerphone which sends a notification to all guardians´ smartphones. Any guardian can call back  to the child. The child can answer the incoming call with a press of a button. The application notifies the other guardians about the call with a profile timeline event &amp; notification.</p>

<div><b>Snowfox trackerphone is now fully designed and certified for sales start. We have the data and voice call subscription agreements in place for the planned global rollout.

<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>
<b>1. Schedule risk in regards of hugely successful campaign: </b>If we need to suddenly increase the planned production volume, we might need to order new batches of components, which will take time. The estimated delivery for longest lead time components is 21 weeks. This means that in the worst case the final shipments to our contributors will take place in early 2017. In every case the first devices will ship starting in October 2016.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>2. New way to provide the data and voice connectivity: </b>The approach we have taken to provide the easiest possible means for getting started with Snowfox means that there is still some uncertainty on the global performance of the backend.

In this case we are prepared to work with you to solve any arising issues. </div>

NowThis Mashup (video)



Snowfox Trackerphone allows you to call your child at anytime. There is only one button on the device so kids learn easily to use Snowfox. The child can press the button and the parents will get a call-me notification. 
Every Snowfox device has an embedded SIM and local operator subscription inbuilt, so getting started is easy. You simply add the device to your application and you are good to go.


The World is a magical place for children. They need to explore and play to learn the necessary skills for the life ahead. Snowfox brings extra comfort to the first steps of independence.
With Snowfox you are in the know of your child´s whereabouts. Snowfox sends smart notifications to your smartphone from designated places and you can also see the current location on the child on Snowfox smartphone application.


When you were a child, there were no personal screens causing problems at home. Children spent remarkable time playing, exploring the neighborhood and visiting friends. Snowfox lets your kids play and explore, while maintaining a direct line to mum and dad. Kids feel safe and happy having Snowfox with them on their small adventures. 













 Snowfox Trackerphone is designed and manufactured in Finland. 












Every Snowfox Trackerphone includes an embedded SIM which comes with a monthly pay-as-you go plan for €9.90EUR for EU and $9.90USD for US & Canada, which includes unlimited data and voice calls for one Snowfox Trackerphone in your country. Monthly billing for the plan happens handily on the app via credit card. We use Stripe for payments processing.

Snowfox first use experience and backend services has been carefully designed to provide a seamless start into connecting your family. It is the first trackerphone that can be sold in every store. We use multiple mobile networks in each country to make sure Snowfox has the best connectivity at all times!



We have taken the end-to-end quality of the product a focus area for our design & engineering project. To reach the target quality we have been doing user testing & co-creation with prototype devices for more than 6 months. Working directly with customers has given us many insights on how to improve the product, as well as given us the opportunity to polish the device behavior prior to sales start. We are now pretty confident the device will work as intended.








 At the beginning of the campaign we have selected 10 countries where Snowfox Trackerphones can be shipped. At first you can get the trackerphone to following countries: USA, Canada, UK, Germany, The Netherlands, Spain, Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland. More countries might be added during the campaign.
You will decide which countries we target next!
We are really looking forward to seeing how Snowfox Trackerphone is received  around the world. Currently we have the connectivity agreements to 32 countries and counting. If the campaign goes well, there might be some countries added during our campaign. Please share the message and get a supporter perk to influence our decision!

Similarly, diabetes and hypertension epidemics are increasing worldwide. It is estimated that one in three Americans will eventually develop diabetes and over 3 million people a year will be diagnosed with hypertension. Most medical doctorate degrees do not require exercise science nor nutrition to be a mandatory part of their curriculum. Due to this, your doctor may not have the right tools needed to prescribe the right plan of action for a patient to combat these illnesses.

Similarly, diabetes and hypertension epidemics are increasing worldwide. It is estimated that one in three Americans will eventually develop diabetes and over 3 million people a year will be diagnosed with hypertension. Most medical doctorate degrees do not require exercise science nor nutrition to be a mandatory part of their curriculum. Due to this, your doctor may not have the right tools needed to prescribe the right plan of action for a patient to combat these illnesses. It is not the patient’s fault that they do not follow the doctor’s advice to exercise and eat healthier, due to the lack of prescription specificity and community support.  By improving nutrition and increasing activity we can lower healthcare costs through fewer doctor's visits, less medical tests needed, decrease prescription drug usage, and lower the risk for a wide range of diseases. Health-E-Matrix is designed to assist individuals in reducing their dependency on medications needed for diseases and illnesses caused by unhealthy lifestyles.  By simply reducing the body weight of an individual with type 2 diabetes by 10%, it reduces the amount of medication they need or eliminating it completely.  If 1/4 of the percentage of individuals who have Type 2 diabetes were able to reduce their weight, not only would it positively impact their health, but eventually affect the healthcare market.  This effect would resonate beyond themselves and help the ones they know and love and even those individuals they don’t.    Healthcare needs a Hero...You​​With your donation,  we will use exercise as medicine in order to make prevention profitable in the interest of individuals, doctors, trainers, and health insurance companies. The bottom line is, physicians do not always have the time or resources needed to spend with each individual patient to provide them the proper guidelines on diet and exercise. This by no means is a fault of theirs, but the demand of an ever-increasing patient count due to obesity related health issues means more patients for each doctor and less time dedicated to each patient.We have created HEALTH-E-MATRIX, a medical fitness system that engages, educates, and empowers doctors and qualified fitness professionals to collaborate together. This system facilitates collaboration through electronic health records, practice management software and social networks to build trust management, accountability and quality control to disseminate useful information to its applicants and patients.                                                                   As a result of our system, individuals will:gain access to protocol-based fitness services to increase appropriate physical activitiesmake better-informed lifestyle choices based on a doctor’s prescription for exercisemotivate users to take responsibility for their health and health informationTeamwork Approach to HealthcareAt Rise to Purpose, we have a unique team of individuals ranging from fitness professionals, nutritionists and insurance experts who each bring their own set of exemplary skills to the table. With more and more baby boomers outliving their children, factors such as less activity due to more demanding job and personal lives contribute to the percentage of the population becoming increasingly overweight will not only contribute to the rise in obesity but the risk of developing diabetes and other obesity related health issues, as shown in graphic below. Your contribution will not only help the lives of your family and friends, but will also help change the lives of those you don't know and generations to come. Here at Rise to Purpose we strongly believe in people helping people; with your donation to Health-E-Matrix, you are helping someone you may never know live a longer, healthier life for their children and their family. How much does it cost to change our nation’s healthcare? In order to get HEALTH-E-MATRIX running we need to raise $100,000. Your support for this campaign will help us cover the costs of: 
The hiring of an app and web designer to create communication between our program and your mobile device
Creating the app on several different platforms to connect your physician and personal trainer
The hiring and training of fitness professionals in over 40 states

If you don't believe us, check-out below reviews. With your support, we want to introduce 4 great tasting flavours to our range. - Toffee Popcorn Swirl- Mint Chocolate Cookie- Vanilla Cheesecake- Double Chocolate Brownies HOW VENUS-PRO CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE.THERMO SLIM SHAKE –GreenWe're so excited to announce that not only is VENUS-PRO happening, but Thermo Slim Shake Green version already on the move. This new formula contains 100% plant based protein, thermo blend, added probiotics & vitamins to accommodate those following a paleo, vegetarian, or vegan diet.VENUS StoryVENUS-PRO thermo slim shake is not another protein shake. It is the future. You are no longer limited to a shake. With VENUS-PRO you can bake food, take it after workout, as a snack, or make most delicious healthy desserts. After 16 years of experience I realised that how important it is to base our formula based on current science and nutrition demand. My StoryI started Venus Nutrition (VENUS ARMY) International in 2015 with the goal of providing dynamic and innovative fitness and nutrition movements for women around the world. ‘A complete tool box for women.’However, I don’t want to tell you how great our brand is or why we want to help end world hunger and make a difference in those areas that we are concerned about. Today I want to share a story, a story that can change the way you look at things. And it is my story. Everything you read from here on began with a dream to make a difference in the world that we all share.Before VENUS was born I went through a life changing transformation; from a divorce to becoming homeless to losing my first business idea and going completely bankrupt. At one time I had only £5 to eat for 3 weeks. Often I ate only one meal a day. Most people who face these similar situations would give up and take the exit route because it is too painful to experience this, why would anyone want to put themselves in a situation like this.I realised that if I could somehow connect my passion, with a global movement and build a company, my dream can become a reality. A company powered by its staff members, customers and fans.Today Venus is ready to expand its wings across the USA, UK, Australia and Europe. We are inviting passionate people to join us and we hope to build the most powerful movement in the fitness world. We want to re-invent the fitness industry with great stories of our time.",24.0,5,"1 Campaign

<p>Hiya! Thank you for taking a peek at my campaign page. As a contributor to a number of gofundme asks, I recognize it really is a community effort to support people in getting the help they need during crises or in achieving their dreams through necessary funding. I am a university graduate with a passion for skincare and products that are not only beneficial for your body, but also the environment, and the folks who provided the labor to make it possible!</p>
<p>After spending years using products that are basically water &amp; preservatives, I began to finally experiment with making my own formula. My goal was to find the right ratio that could moisturize, soften, rejuvenate, and most importantly, lock in that moisture. The added perk was creating scents that are unique and memorable. Last year I started my first line under the name Hellebore Satin, an homage to some of my favorite flowers, to great reception and reviews: </p>

<h3>A 7-Part Docuseries - The Message</h3>
<p><u><strong>The Truth About Aging</strong></u> is a ground breaking docuseries from award-winning filmmaker, John Dahlgren &amp; Optimal Health Practitioner, Jason Prall, that takes you on an exciting journey to the world's Blue Zones on a mission to uncover secrets of the longest-lived, documented populations around the world. </p>
<p><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Blue Zones have been studied for more than 40 years and while a few of their healthy </span>habits<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> have been identified, the underlying biological mechanisms that explain WHY these groups live so long &amp; exactly how their lifestyle translates to health have yet to be effectively communicated to the public. Our film series plans to do just that!</span></font></p>
<p><strong>What separates this film is our focus on <u>HEALTH</u>.</strong></p>
<p>This is not a film about how to treat disease. Rather, our message will concentrate on dietary and lifestyle measures that build and maintain health as we age.</p>
<h3>The Harsh Truth</h3>
<ul>
<li>The percentage of American children and adolescents who are considered overweight or <strong>obese has tripled</strong> since 1970.</li>
<li>Over 1/3 of American children are overweight or obese.</li>
<li>Columbia University researchers project that there will be <strong>$48 – $66 billion added</strong> to current health care costs each year between now and 2030.</li>
<li>More than <strong>70% of adults</strong> across the United States are already being diagnosed with a chronic disease.</li>
<li>The treatment of the seven most common chronic diseases, coupled with productivity losses, costs the U.S. economy <strong>more than $1 trillion dollars</strong> annually.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the last 70 years, the modern world has taken a turn for the worse. Our food, water, air, and soil are poisoned with toxins. Our atmosphere is blanketed in electromagnetic (EMF) waves. And our society is fixated on technology while community dissolves.</p>

<p>In short, no. We'll never be able to ditch modernity and precisely model life in the Blue Zones. In fact, evidence suggests the Blue Zones aren't quite the Blue Zones they used to be...longevity is diminishing in many of them too!</p>
<p>In order to reduce chronic disease and increase longevity, we must investigate our modern environment and lifestyles and find out how we can optimize them to improve health as society progresses.</p>
<p>Not only will this film detail the factors that contribute to health, but we'll show and explain the avoidable environmental &amp; lifestyle factors responsible for the drastic rise in chronic diseases like Alzheimer's, Diabetes, Autoimmunity, Cancer, and much more as we interview top scientists, researchers, healers, medical professionals, pediatricians, and gerontologists around the world.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I'm going to be honest...I'm a little nervous that we won't raise enough money to be able to tell the story we need to tell. And if we don't, how will this message get out??</p>
<p>There is <u><strong>no money in the health message we're promoting</strong></u>. It involves no drugs, no supplements, no technology, and no fancy programs. In fact, our message detracts from all those industries.</p>
<p>So if we don't tell this story of real health &amp; longevity, who will? There isn't anybody that profits from true, fundamental, natural health. Just ask the people of the Blue Zones.</p>

deeply involved with girls and women's rugby development in Uganda we felt that
we needed to offer more to our fellow players around the country so  5 of
us founded  <b><i>RUGBY TACKLING LIFE .</i></b></p>
<p>Imagine you are 14 year old girl and your parents want to marry
you off. There is no money for school fees for you or for your other 6
siblings. You went to school for 7 years if you were lucky but spent most of
your childhood digging gardens, growing food or attending to goat. That sounds very much like a different world

reality.</p>

their lives in all aspects.  Whether it is finishing school, becoming a
teenage mother, being selected to represent Uganda, landing a great job... At <b><i>RUGBY TACKLING LIFE  </i></b>we do not choose
a path for the girls and young women to take but equip them with skills and
confidence so they can take the right path that suits them and will help them
tackle life; on and off the
rugby pitch.</p>
<p>This is the first year that we are
rolling out  <b><i>RUGBY TACKLING LIFE. </i></b> We currently have 2000 girls
and women playing Rugby in Uganda. We have identified 3 students in each of our
Rugby regions and we want to ensure that we keep them in school. We also
need to carry out rugby training clinics in various regions and hold rugby
tournaments. As much as we believe in women empowerment, we also include
boys and men who stand out in supporting us. For empowerment can only be
sustainable and a reality if all members of the society contribute.</p>

<b><i>RUGBY TACKLING LIFE</i></b>?</b></p>
<p>In cooperation with Great Lakes Coffee Ltd, we developed our
very own COOFFEEE brand. For every bag we sell Great Lakes Coffee donates a
specific amount to us. The more bags we sell, the bigger our funds are to run
our programme.</p>
<p>We have already started selling
COOFFEE in Uganda but we think that we should not stop here because COOFFEEE is
super delicious AND everyone should have the opportunity to drink as much of it
as we do.</p>
<p>With this campaign we are aiming to raise the funds for our

TACKLING LIFE  REACHES OUT TO RUGBY PLAYING GIRLS AND WOMEN IN UGANDA TO EMPOWER THEM TO MAKE
THEIR LIFE CHOICES AND SUPPORT THEM IN EVERY ASPECT OF LIFE. THROUGH THE SALE
OF OUR VERY OWN COOFFEEE WE ARE AIMING TO SUSTAINABLY FINANCE RUGBY TACKLING LIFE .As a group of women rugby players
deeply involved with girls and women's rugby development in Uganda we felt that
we needed to offer more to our fellow players around the country so  5 of
us founded  RUGBY TACKLING LIFE .
Imagine you are 14 year old girl and your parents want to marry
you off. There is no money for school fees for you or for your other 6
siblings. You went to school for 7 years if you were lucky but spent most of
your childhood digging gardens, growing food or attending to goat. That sounds very much like a different world
to most of us but unfortunately for many Ugandan girls, it is the
reality.
With Rugby we found a way to get the girls together and impact
their lives in all aspects.  Whether it is finishing school, becoming a
teenage mother, being selected to represent Uganda, landing a great job... At RUGBY TACKLING LIFE  we do not choose
a path for the girls and young women to take but equip them with skills and
confidence so they can take the right path that suits them and will help them
tackle life; on and off the
rugby pitch.
This is the first year that we are
rolling out  RUGBY TACKLING LIFE.  We currently have 2000 girls
and women playing Rugby in Uganda. We have identified 3 students in each of our
Rugby regions and we want to ensure that we keep them in school. We also
need to carry out rugby training clinics in various regions and hold rugby
tournaments. As much as we believe in women empowerment, we also include
boys and men who stand out in supporting us. For empowerment can only be
sustainable and a reality if all members of the society contribute.
How we are financing
RUGBY TACKLING LIFE?
In cooperation with Great Lakes Coffee Ltd, we developed our
very own COOFFEEE brand. For every bag we sell Great Lakes Coffee donates a
specific amount to us. The more bags we sell, the bigger our funds are to run
our programme.
We have already started selling
COOFFEE in Uganda but we think that we should not stop here because COOFFEEE is
super delicious AND everyone should have the opportunity to drink as much of it
as we do.
With this campaign we are aiming to raise the funds for our
RUGBY TACKLING LIFE  and start the distribution for COOFFFEEE so
that we are able to sustain our work. 
MAKE YOUR DONATION, DRINK COOFFEEE, SUPPORT RUGBY TACKLING LIFE AND ALL RUGBY PLAYING GIRLS AND WOMEN IN UGANDA TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICES IN THEIR LIFES.",5.0,2,"1 Campaign

<div>Since 2007 I had a vision to set up a  rock climbing gym in Yerevan, so we would have a place to keep on climbing during winter season, as well to attract more people into climbing.  And finally, my friend Daniel Domingo supported my inspiration and we opened ""Boulder Town"" on Oct 2015 in downtown of Yerevan!</div>
<div>This was the greatest experience for rock climbing we ever had in Armenia.

<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">On the other hand the Armenian Alpine Club, which is a member federation of IFSC (International Federation of Sport Climbing) and UIAA, has counted on the gym where to prepare an Armenian National Climbing Teams (both for youth and adult), which would be representing Armenia in international competitions! </span></div>

It means getting connected — to your body, your breath, your community, yourself. There are no limits. </p><p>Right now, Yoke Fitness is a dream. With your support, it will become a Saint Paul-based fitness studio staffed by devoted, inclusive teachers that offers community- and self-empowering yoga and barre classes.</p><p>The word ""yoga” in Sanskrit translates to “to yoke” in English. We want students to “yoke” or connect to themselves, and to build connections outside themselves any way that they wish.</p><h3>Yoke to your health</h3><p>How do yoga and barre classes cultivate connections? At Yoke, we’re a community focused on more than pure athleticism or six pack abs: we want our yogis and barre-istas to feel physically strong and capable of anything they wish. That can translate into carrying in all the groceries in one trip, making it up the stairs more easily, and holding both children/grandchildren/furry-pet-children at the same time. Deeper connection to their physical body may help any student in our community create more connections to their minds, their emotions, and to others.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507125887/oq4lmj87auvuj5ugmvl0.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2> </h2><h2>What will I experience at Yoke Fitness?</h2><h3>Our Space</h3><p>Our single-room studio encourages connection to teachers and to other students. Our community is inclusive and encourages effort, understanding, acceptance, humor, curiosity and a welcoming group dynamic.  You’ll make many human connections here! Come upstairs, take off your coat, set aside your to-do list, and talk with the teacher about what you want to do in class.  </p><h3>
<br/><strong>The Experience</strong>
</h3><p>The way we all manage ourselves during physical challenge offers valuable insight to our coping mechanisms in other areas of life.  Yoke's classes will challenge your physical limits, and provide you with a safe space to reflect on your self-talk and knee-jerk responses during challenging moments.  Classes will move mindfully, intentionally, and specifically for each student.  Prior to class, our teaching staff will take requests from our students. Whether you have a specific request or not, our teachers will encourage you to try out different options and tailor class to your needs.</p><p>Our hope is that pairing improved physical fitness with greater self-understanding may lead you to improved connections in all areas of life. One connection often leads to another and another! #getyoked</p><p> </p><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507126067/xsabnia7ot6qrpezwhct.jpg"" src=""""/></h2><h2> </h2><h2>What classes can I take at Yoke?</h2><h3>Yoga</h3><p>We feature a non-religious, vinyasa-based practice at Yoke Fitness. You'll flow, balance, build strength, flexibility and spend focused time being still, and breathing. You're encouraged to reflect or concentrate if you wish to build a meditation practice — or to simply enjoy stillness in the midst of your busy day. At Yoke we're practicing moving with intention to facilitate greater health and strength!</p><p><strong>Yoga offerings</strong></p><p><i>Meld</i></p><ul>
<li>Slower-moving yoga class will feature minimal flow, longer holds, and the support of yoga props to enable you to customize your experience in postures.</li>
<li>Class will include at least 10 minutes focused on breathing and reflection.</li>
<li>Ideal for students who are new to yoga, and those who enjoy the discipline of holding postures longer.</li>
</ul><p><i>Connect</i></p><ul>
<li>A more athletic yoga class that will flow!</li>
<li>Class features balance, strength, and surrender in a faster-paced format.</li>
<li>You'll be able to grow foundational knowledge you’ve gained in Meld, and find ways to challenge your physical abilities and mental focus.</li>
<li>Ideal for those who wish to flow faster. Students of all levels are welcome — you're encouraged to modify class to meet your needs!</li>
</ul><h3>Barre</h3><p>Experience the exhilarating feeling of hard work in this full-body workout.  This group fitness class will get your muscles trembling and help grow your strength based on your specific physical needs and wants. Barre is a fantastically accessible class format; triathletes and non-athletes with joint restrictions can practice side-by-side.</p><p><strong>Barre offerings</strong></p><p><i>Cleave</i> </p><ul>
<li>Based on a traditional barre class, this total body workout focuses on isolating muscle groups, with limited range of motion. You'll use light weights, a ballet barre and other accessories to fatigue all of your muscles while protecting your joints.</li>
<li>Classes will include sections focused on lower body, upper body, core, stretching, and stillness.</li>
<li>The limited range of motion and low-impact nature of this class makes it ideal for students of <i>all</i> experience and fitness levels.<br/> </li>

I’m Lauren. Long time athlete, and fitness enthusiast. I’m an MN native, and transplanted to St. Paul in 2013 and instantly fell in love with the ‘small town’ feel and community of St. Paul. I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a degree in clothing design (believe it or not) and took a job soon out of school at Target Corp. I learned the details of Excel grids, business analysis, and corporate politics there. I made many valuable human connections, developed lots of business and financial skill – and learned that big companies are not for me. During that time, I participated in my first 200hr RYT program. I had very little yoga experience and no intention of teaching, but thought that learning something new would add some fun back into my weekly routine. I discovered that I loved teaching! I love encouraging students and watching them expand their capabilities! While teaching, I slowly made a transition from my corporate job to yoga studio management. At the end of my tenure as a manager, I was overseeing goal setting and staff development of 9 studios, 21 managers, and nearly $4 million in revenue annually. I left to follow a dream – this dream – of opening a studio I could run myself. I’m passionate about creating a small, connected community of students and teachers.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507315014/i0swb2ggkrovekyb8kju.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Marisa Benasutti</strong></p><ul><li>Training &amp; formats:</li></ul><p>200 hr RYT, Yin Yoga, Barre</p><ul><li>Why I love teaching:</li></ul><p>I'm passionate about teaching yoga because it brings many people together on their journey of reclaiming their own health.</p><ul><li>Catchphrase:</li></ul><p>Find a place that's comfortably uncomfortable</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507314094/rz9jwuujoaor5ryj28ti.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Kate Jahnke</strong></p><ul><li>Training &amp; formats:</li></ul><p>Vinyasa, barre</p><ul><li>Why I love teaching:</li></ul><p>My classes are upbeat and challenging, while still making each student feel they are just where they should be on their own journey.

It means getting connected — to your body, your breath, your community, yourself. There are no limits. Right now, Yoke Fitness is a dream. With your support, it will become a Saint Paul-based fitness studio staffed by devoted, inclusive teachers that offers community- and self-empowering yoga and barre classes.The word ""yoga” in Sanskrit translates to “to yoke” in English. We want students to “yoke” or connect to themselves, and to build connections outside themselves any way that they wish.Yoke to your healthHow do yoga and barre classes cultivate connections? At Yoke, we’re a community focused on more than pure athleticism or six pack abs: we want our yogis and barre-istas to feel physically strong and capable of anything they wish. That can translate into carrying in all the groceries in one trip, making it up the stairs more easily, and holding both children/grandchildren/furry-pet-children at the same time. Deeper connection to their physical body may help any student in our community create more connections to their minds, their emotions, and to others.  What will I experience at Yoke Fitness?Our SpaceOur single-room studio encourages connection to teachers and to other students. Our community is inclusive and encourages effort, understanding, acceptance, humor, curiosity and a welcoming group dynamic.  You’ll make many human connections here! Come upstairs, take off your coat, set aside your to-do list, and talk with the teacher about what you want to do in class.  
The Experience
The way we all manage ourselves during physical challenge offers valuable insight to our coping mechanisms in other areas of life.  Yoke's classes will challenge your physical limits, and provide you with a safe space to reflect on your self-talk and knee-jerk responses during challenging moments.  Classes will move mindfully, intentionally, and specifically for each student.  Prior to class, our teaching staff will take requests from our students. Whether you have a specific request or not, our teachers will encourage you to try out different options and tailor class to your needs.Our hope is that pairing improved physical fitness with greater self-understanding may lead you to improved connections in all areas of life. One connection often leads to another and another! #getyoked  What classes can I take at Yoke?YogaWe feature a non-religious, vinyasa-based practice at Yoke Fitness. You'll flow, balance, build strength, flexibility and spend focused time being still, and breathing. You're encouraged to reflect or concentrate if you wish to build a meditation practice — or to simply enjoy stillness in the midst of your busy day. At Yoke we're practicing moving with intention to facilitate greater health and strength!Yoga offeringsMeld
Slower-moving yoga class will feature minimal flow, longer holds, and the support of yoga props to enable you to customize your experience in postures.
Class will include at least 10 minutes focused on breathing and reflection.
Ideal for students who are new to yoga, and those who enjoy the discipline of holding postures longer.
Connect
A more athletic yoga class that will flow!
Class features balance, strength, and surrender in a faster-paced format.
You'll be able to grow foundational knowledge you’ve gained in Meld, and find ways to challenge your physical abilities and mental focus.
Ideal for those who wish to flow faster. Students of all levels are welcome — you're encouraged to modify class to meet your needs!
BarreExperience the exhilarating feeling of hard work in this full-body workout.  This group fitness class will get your muscles trembling and help grow your strength based on your specific physical needs and wants. Barre is a fantastically accessible class format; triathletes and non-athletes with joint restrictions can practice side-by-side.Barre offeringsCleave 
Based on a traditional barre class, this total body workout focuses on isolating muscle groups, with limited range of motion. You'll use light weights, a ballet barre and other accessories to fatigue all of your muscles while protecting your joints.
Classes will include sections focused on lower body, upper body, core, stretching, and stillness.
The limited range of motion and low-impact nature of this class makes it ideal for students of all experience and fitness levels. 
 What is my money funding?We've worked hard to find the perfect space for Yoke Fitness! But we still need some things to make it into a beautiful, functional yoga and barre studio. When you contribute to this campaign, you're funding:  Why Yoke Fitness?Yoke Fitness is a simple idea that grew into a big dream: an intimate, Saint Paul-based yoga and barre studio where students of all experience levels, body types, ages, and passions could come together to connect with each other and themselves. If you watched our campaign video (check it out above!), you've already met founder Lauren – with her skills and experience, our beautiful space, and the community of instructors and students-to-be that's already beginning to form, we believe now is the perfect time to make this dream a reality.The Yoke Fitness Timeline Meet the teamLauren Hopps, Owner & FounderHi! I’m Lauren. Long time athlete, and fitness enthusiast. I’m an MN native, and transplanted to St. Paul in 2013 and instantly fell in love with the ‘small town’ feel and community of St. Paul. I graduated from the University of Minnesota with a degree in clothing design (believe it or not) and took a job soon out of school at Target Corp. I learned the details of Excel grids, business analysis, and corporate politics there. I made many valuable human connections, developed lots of business and financial skill – and learned that big companies are not for me. During that time, I participated in my first 200hr RYT program. I had very little yoga experience and no intention of teaching, but thought that learning something new would add some fun back into my weekly routine. I discovered that I loved teaching! I love encouraging students and watching them expand their capabilities! While teaching, I slowly made a transition from my corporate job to yoga studio management. At the end of my tenure as a manager, I was overseeing goal setting and staff development of 9 studios, 21 managers, and nearly $4 million in revenue annually. I left to follow a dream – this dream – of opening a studio I could run myself. I’m passionate about creating a small, connected community of students and teachers. Marisa BenasuttiTraining & formats:200 hr RYT, Yin Yoga, BarreWhy I love teaching:I'm passionate about teaching yoga because it brings many people together on their journey of reclaiming their own health.Catchphrase:Find a place that's comfortably uncomfortableKate JahnkeTraining & formats:Vinyasa, barreWhy I love teaching:My classes are upbeat and challenging, while still making each student feel they are just where they should be on their own journey.

<p><b><span>  TEN GREAT BENEFITS OF
DRAGON FRUIT</span></b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Cardiovascular</b></p>
<p>The seeds in dragon fruit are high
in polyunsaturated fatty acids (omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids). These healthy
fats actually help reduce triglycerides and lower the risk of cardiovascular disease.
Dragon fruit also contains vitamin B3 which lowers our bad (LDL) cholesterol
levels while raising our good (HDL) cholesterol levels. Additionally, dragon
fruit is known to help decrease high levels of oxidative stress, one of the
main contributing factors in cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p><b>Cancer</b></p>
<p>Dragon fruit is loaded with
beneficial antioxidants like phytoalbumins (located mainly within the seeds)
which aid in the prevention of cancer-causing free radicals. They also contain
high levels of vitamin C, which helps to block tumour cell growth, and can
improve quality of life of patients currently suffering from cancer (reduced
symptoms like fatigue, nausea, vomiting, pain and appetite loss). Dragon fruit
can also help rid the body of toxic heavy metals, which are a major culprit in
the formation of tumours in the body.</p>
<p><b>Digestion and metabolism</b></p>
<p>Dragon fruit is incredibly high in
fibre! I can personally eat 2-3 dragon fruits and be satisfied for hours on end
(I was actually quite surprised to feel so full after such little fruit!). The
fibre content in dragon fruit helps regulate our digestion and prevents
constipation and diarrhea. Keeping your stomach full for hours after you have
eaten is one issue facing those who want to lose weight. This exotic fruit will
not only keep you satisfied for longer periods of time, but it will help
improve your metabolic rate, assisting with weight management. Dragon fruit
also helps regulate blood sugar levels (again, due to the high fibre content),
and helps your body from experiencing sugar spikes that you would normally get
from eating refined sugary sweets (donuts, cakes, cookies, etc.).</p>
<p><b>Immune support</b></p>
<p>The high vitamin and mineral content
in dragon fruit, ranging from Vitamin’s C, B1, B2, B3, as well as calcium,
phosphorous, iron, protein, niacin and fibre, make it a great way to improve
the functioning of your immune system. Your immune system starts in your
digestive tract, and as we saw above, dragon fruit is a great way to support a
healthy GI tract. Getting a proper amount of vitamins and minerals in your diet
helps prevent you from getting sick and catching infections. As well,
antioxidants (which dragon fruit is loaded), can help fight off bacteria and
viruses in the body. The 80% water content of dragon fruit will also help flush
out stagnant toxins, which may otherwise manifest as some sort of disease or
illness (either now or in the future).</p>
<p><b>Eyes</b></p>
<p>Improved eyesight from eating dragon
fruit? You bet! This fruit contains Vitamin A in the form of carotene
which is needed by the retina of the eye for both low-light (night vision) and
colour vision. Night blindness and other eye problems such as age-related
macular degeneration can be caused by a deficiency in Vitamin A.</p>
<p><b>Nervous system</b></p>
<p>The high B Vitamin content in dragon
fruit helps to support the formation and maintenance of some of the most basic
structures in the nervous system. It helps in the formation of nerve cells
themselves, and makes us more alert, and experience higher levels of mental
clarity. Calcium in dragon fruit is also essential in enhancing the functioning
of the nervous system. It keeps our nerves healthy and ensures their ability to
communicate effectively. The healthy fats in dragon fruit are also crucial to
help nourish and protect the myelin sheath which allows for proper conductive
signalling in the brain.</p>
<p><b>Strong bones and teeth</b></p>
<p>Because it is a good source of
calcium and phosphorous, dragon fruit helps strengthen your bones and teeth and
aids in tissue formation and repair. These two important nutrients work
together closely to build strong bones and teeth, which makes dragon fruit a
wonderful fruit to help aid in the prevention of brittle bones and
osteoporosis. The co-dependency of these two minerals means that taking a
calcium supplement simply won’t help the health of your bones, as would drinking
a whole ripe fruit juice which contains the combination of the two minerals.
Always keep in mind that <b>both calcium and phosphorous</b> are needed to
support any increase in bone mass.</p>
<p><b>Glowing skin</b></p>
<p>The high seed content in dragon
fruit makes them a great source of healthy monounsaturated fats which improve
the look and feel of our skin. Pretty much all fruit is antioxidant rich,
including dragon fruit, and so consuming a diet rich in raw plant-based foods
will stave off free radicals and make you not only look younger, but make your
skin tighter, more flexible and bless you with a beautiful healthy glow!</p>
<p><b>Anti-inflammatory</b></p>
<p>Dragon fruit is known as a great
anti-inflammatory as it helps to decrease irritation of the joints.
Inflammation in the body caused by unhealthy eating habits and poor lifestyle
choices (smoking, alcohol, drugs, etc.) create an acidic environment which
manifests as a variety of diseases like arthritis, cancer, and diabetes to name
a few. When we start to replace healthy drinks, like dragon fruit, for
unhealthy drinks (like sweets and refined processed drinks), we will notice
that the aches and pains that used to haunt us day in, day out, suddenly fade
away. Replacing your favourite sugary desserts for things like dragon fruit and
mango (or any other fruit) will help get you out of your sugar-tooth rut and
improve your body for the better.</p>
<p><b>Anti-aging</b></p>
<p>Skip the anti-aging cream, save
thousands of dollars, and instead go eat dragon fruit! The high vitamin and
mineral content as well as vast arrays of antioxidants in the dragon fruit make
it an excellent anti-ager! The antioxidants work against free radicals in the
body which are responsible for not only physical ailments (disease, and
illness), but also for the aging of your skin. The more fresh fruit and
vegetables you consume, the tighter and younger your skin will become.</p>

 HI My name is David Wilson, after many years in production engineering in many countries I have finally settled in Vietnam.
Vietnam grows some of the finest dragon fruit in the world, when dragon fruit is processed into concentrate it makes a refreshing and enervating drink with many health benefits.
We are producing concentrate for the local market and it is already well received.
We wish to expand our facilities to enable us to enter the global market and this project will create many jobs for local people and help the farmers to sell their products locally. 
We are totally committed to this project because it will help the the local population and increase the quality of their lives as well as giving an exotic new taste to the world.
Contributors will enable an impoverished workforce to advance themselves and better provide for their families, it will also help in education as we are offering services freely to the local agricultural college in the form of engineering safety and basic English language courses.
  
We need to raise $300.000 to buy land build and equip the plant,
This may not seem much but fortunately we have been offered very good terms on the land by the local government 
We will purchase production equipment in country, use local labour for the build and installation.
Marketing will be a priority during the lead time in the plant

When we start to produce in quantity we will issue gifts in the form of thank you certificates, T-shirts, delicate 3d greetings cards suitable for birthdays anniversaries etc, limited edition dragon fruit red or white wine and for donations over a certain amount the opportunity to become a stakeholder in the new company.
If we do not reach our entire goal the plan is to rent a factory until we are in a position to buy.
For the people of the dragon fruit growing area this project represents a major boost to the local economy, the world at large will benefit from and enjoy a unique new tropical taste that is beneficial on so many levels.
The product is totally natural and its manufacture poses no threat to the ecology of the earth  


  Risks & ChallengesAs with all investments there are risks but by purchasing the land for this project the equity is secured in the land.There is a lot of bureaucracy involved in the setting up of this project due to the nature of local politics but after spending many years here we are well used to dealing with it and it does not really pose a problem   Any problems with bureaucracy that may occur can be overcome by patient negotiation with the local authorities with whom we have an excellent rapport.

osteoporosis. The co-dependency of these two minerals means that taking a
calcium supplement simply won’t help the health of your bones, as would drinking
a whole ripe fruit juice which contains the combination of the two minerals.
Always keep in mind that both calcium and phosphorous are needed to
support any increase in bone mass.
Glowing skin
The high seed content in dragon
fruit makes them a great source of healthy monounsaturated fats which improve
the look and feel of our skin. Pretty much all fruit is antioxidant rich,
including dragon fruit, and so consuming a diet rich in raw plant-based foods
will stave off free radicals and make you not only look younger, but make your
skin tighter, more flexible and bless you with a beautiful healthy glow!
Anti-inflammatory
Dragon fruit is known as a great
anti-inflammatory as it helps to decrease irritation of the joints.
Inflammation in the body caused by unhealthy eating habits and poor lifestyle
choices (smoking, alcohol, drugs, etc.) create an acidic environment which
manifests as a variety of diseases like arthritis, cancer, and diabetes to name
a few. When we start to replace healthy drinks, like dragon fruit, for
unhealthy drinks (like sweets and refined processed drinks), we will notice
that the aches and pains that used to haunt us day in, day out, suddenly fade
away. Replacing your favourite sugary desserts for things like dragon fruit and
mango (or any other fruit) will help get you out of your sugar-tooth rut and
improve your body for the better.
Anti-aging
Skip the anti-aging cream, save
thousands of dollars, and instead go eat dragon fruit! The high vitamin and
mineral content as well as vast arrays of antioxidants in the dragon fruit make
it an excellent anti-ager! The antioxidants work against free radicals in the
body which are responsible for not only physical ailments (disease, and
illness), but also for the aging of your skin. The more fresh fruit and
vegetables you consume, the tighter and younger your skin will become.

</h3> <p>Urinary incontinence is a significant threat to the quality of life for people with autism spectrum disorder, jeopardizing autonomy, community inclusion, physical comfort, hygiene, and peer acceptance. Our studies have shown that as many as 35% of children with autism are not using the toilet for urination by age 5. Considering this, it is evident that a training method that increases the rate of toileting skill acquisition while decreasing stress is greatly needed.</p>
<p>Daniel Mruzek, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Neurodevelopmental &amp; Behavioral Pediatrics at the University of Rochester has developed a method that is expected to result in faster, less anxiety-producing toilet training for children with autism spectrum disorder. Big diaper companies aren't interested in speeding up toilet training and a startup company needs to convince investors that this system can be easily mass-produced for the consumer market.</p>
<p>We are hoping to raise enough money to make some important changes to the system. We want to make it easier to manufacture the components and easier to use so more families can experience toilet training success.</p>

What We're Asking For
 Clinical research has shown that our methods and system really work and can make toilet training children with autism easier and less stressful, both for the child as well as for the caregiver.

Cost: ~$4,000.






The remaining $2,000 we are asking for will cover the cost of modifications to the app.

<p>30 Second Smile is not just another electric toothbrush. What separates this brush from the other brushes on the market is the <b>unique</b> brush head design. Now, you can have the <b>peace of mind</b> that you are brushing precisely as your dentist instructs you. Not only does it automatically and comfortably perform proper technique, but 30 seconds of use is equivalent to 2 minutes (or more) with a traditional single-headed brush. We have re-invented what the toothbrush should be...the future of oral care has arrived. </p>

toothbrushes, manual or powered, rotary or sonic, even those with feed-back
sensors, all share a common requirement of 2 minutes or more of user skill and
dexterity in order to deliver effective results. Many brushes provide timers to
encourage brushing for 2 minutes or more. Nevertheless, the average brushing
time is a mere 38 seconds, a significant factor when considering habits that
are contributing to poor oral health.</span><br/></p>
<p>One can
reasonably assume that nothing is going to suddenly make people spend more time
brushing their teeth. And with regard to user skill, it is unlikely that people
will suddenly gain the skill needed to position toothbrushes correctly, thereby
improving oral cleansing results. Dental professionals have been diligently teaching
people how to use all sorts of toothbrushes for decades, yet statistics show
that there has been no real change in the incidence of cavities and gum
disease. </p>

<p>You probably wouldn’t guess that gum disease is the MOST COMMON DISEASE in the world. Yep, there’s a chance your fancy $200 toothbrush is not doing its job. Why? Because you probably are not a dentist or hygienist. The difference between them and us is they are TRAINED to brush teeth and know the exact angles and brush strokes for most effective brushing habits, and most importantly, they are brushing for the right amount of time. The unique features of 30 Second Smile provide all the benefits of brushing properly, just as a dental professional would…all in just 30 seconds. </p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Like many areas of the body, your mouth is
teeming with bacteria — most of them harmless. Normally the body's natural
defenses and good oral health care, such as daily brushing and flossing, can
keep these bacteria under control. However, without proper oral hygiene,
bacteria can reach levels that might lead to oral infections, such as tooth
decay and gum disease. According to the American Academy of Periodontology, gum disease has now been linked to diabetes, endocarditis, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, osteoporosis, and some cancers. There is a clear connection between oral health and systemic health. </span></p>
<p>How can 30 Second Smile impact oral health globally? This toothbrush is the ONLY brush that can automatically brush your teeth properly, delivering excellent daily oral care, and resulting in great oral health. If 30 Second Smile becomes not only a “household name” but millions of users begin to experience the benefits of use, we can impact oral health worldwide.<br/></p>

<p>Let’s make something
clear. 30 Second Smile is not a brand new product. In fact, we have been
selling 30 Second Smile toothbrushes since 2010. The original model consisted
of the same brush head design we have today, but the handle required two AA
Batteries. We had two versions of that, one which included 2 AA Alkaline
batteries and one which included 2 AA NiMH rechargeable batteries plus a wall
charger. We sold these units through a test market for 3 years. We were very
successful in this market and wanted to expand so we continued to add to our
product line and designed an induction unit (one where you just place the
handle into the charging stand and the unit will automatically start charging).
We also added a UV Sanitizing unit with induction charging. </p>

<p><b>2. Will 30 Second Smile cause Abrasion?</b></p>
<p><span style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">NOPE!  </span><b style=""text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Automated Optimum Pressure PLUS Short Stroke = Zero Abrasion</b></p>
</div>
<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<div>
<p></p>
</div>
</div>Using traditional single headed brushes, you may often wonder how much
pressure you should be applying. Brushing too vigorously and / or with too much
pressure can cause abrasion, and can also cause the gums to recede and exposes
root surfaces. It also wears down the tooth structure. When using 30SS, it is
impossible to exert too much pressure or brush too vigorously, because the user
is exerting ZERO force. There is no abrasion because the short stroke action doesn't allow the bristles to move back and forth and sweep over the teeth and gums, instead the tips of the bristles make contact in one spot therefore touching and flex only the amount of the stroke. Additionally, the advanced, wrap-around head configuration provides
automated, EQUALIZED gentle pressure on the inner and outer surfaces. The
result: <b>no chance of tooth or gum abrasion.</b> The 'arms' of the
brush head flex, to provide the perfect pressure for both the front (thinner)
teeth, as well as the molars. The resilient arms provide a pressure that is not
too aggressive to cause abrasion. With all other brushes, the pressure applied
by user can be too high.  1/4""
stroke vs 1"" with a manual brush.</div><div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div><div style=""text-align: justify;""><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">3. Does 30 Second Smile use
Sonic technology?</b></div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p>No, 30 Second Smile  is a totally new technology. Toothbrushes have been around for a long time, and unfortunately, so have cavities and gum disease. The primary cause of cavities and gum disease is improper brushing (human error). Numerous studies show that if a person brushes properly and removes the bacterial plaque from the teeth and along the gum lines, they will significantly reduce the potential for cavities or gum disease.</p>
<p>The secret to high quality oral care is not bristles moving at ""Sonic Speed"". The solution is to use the proper technique to ensure every surface of every tooth is cleansed and the gums properly massaged.  “Can’t make a mistake” technology by 30 Second Smile automatically ensures proper oral care with its patented microbrushes, each and every use. You simply bite and guide, and receive the level of oral care you need, in 1/4th the time required by all other power toothbrushes, and 1/6th the time of any manual brush.</p>

for children, and does it require any special brushes?</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Not

seeking a higher quality of oral hygiene. We hear from parents all the time,
who tell us their kids love using 30 Second Smile. More
importantly, parents tell us that they love 30 Second Smile because they no
longer have to stand over their children to make sure they are properly
brushing their teeth.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">They
tell us, ""If I hear the 30 Second Smile, I know my child is getting proper
oral care.""  And that is what we
call, ""The 30 Second Smile Difference.""  With 30 Second Smile, kids receive a proper
brushing; with other products they (and often their parents) have to do the
work. The patented multi-micro heads are ideal for children's use. They are
small enough to easily fit into their mouth, and 30 Second Smile is safe and
easy to use.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Brush
heads should be replaced every 90 days. This is an industry-wide standard because
after a few months, bristles start to become splayed and frayed, and consequently
become much less effective over time.  </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Not
only are old brush-heads ineffective, they may harbor harmful bacteria. Sick
people should change their brush-heads at the beginning of an illness and after
they feel better.</span></p>

a problem using a traditional toothbrush to properly brush.  30 Second Smile will do the job for them.  And that means whiter teeth, healthier gums,
fresher breath, and better overall health for all family members.  It also means a better partnership with your

it or not this is not a bad sign. Prior to using 30 Second Smile, most people do not
take the time nor exercise the dexterity to maneuver a single headed power or
manual brush in such a way that they clean all surfaces of the teeth and
massage the gums. When the teeth are not properly cleansed and the gums are not massaged,  the gums can become inflamed or infected. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">30
Second Smile is designed to reach the neglected or hard to reach areas of the
gums. As a result, the user can experience some bleeding when these inflamed or

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">With continued use of 30 Second Smile, the neglected area(s) of the gums will be
restored to health, and bleeding and any discomfort (which is negligible) will
cease. To assist you in restoring your gums to a higher level of health, every 30
Second Smile comes with Ultra Soft RED BRISTLES. The Ultra Soft Red Bristles
should be used initially while 30 Second Smile restores your gums to health.
After that, you can use the Standard Soft Brushes for a more penetrating
cleansing of the teeth and gum massage.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">No.  Most people have some level of
gingivitis which is the early stage of gum disease.  Due to plaque
irritation and infection of the gum tissue, swelling and inflammation may be
present </span><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">prior</b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;background-color: initial;""> to using 30 Second
Smile.  When infected, the gum tissue often feels and appears to be red,
spongy, or puffy.  The amazing cleaning qualities of 30 Second Smile will
penetrate under the gums and between the teeth much better.  As a result,
you may experience bleeding initially for several days… up to perhaps a
week.  After this time, the swelling will likely go down, and thus the
gums will become pink, tight, and healthier. 
As gum inflammation is reduced, it reveals more of the tooth, which
should not be confused with gum recession. 
This is gum restoration to better health.</span></p>

30 SECOND SMILE IN SLOW MOTION ACTION!





YOU can be among the first to try the new 30 Second Smile and truly make a positive impact on your life!  This health changing technology is taking SMART brushing to an entirely new level. Whiter teeth, fresher breath, healthier gums, all in a 1/4 of the time. Clinically Proven!
""30 Second Smile REALLY cleans my teeth! I feel like every surface gets brushed and it's so easy. I even brush my teeth well when I am really tired. It's so simple to use. I had never really been good at brushing my teeth, but now my dentist says he can really tell the difference it has made at my cleanings. Thanks for this great product!""Jared L. P., Austin, Texas



30 Second Smile is not just another electric toothbrush. What separates this brush from the other brushes on the market is the unique brush head design. Now, you can have the peace of mind that you are brushing precisely as your dentist instructs you. Not only does it automatically and comfortably perform proper technique, but 30 seconds of use is equivalent to 2 minutes (or more) with a traditional single-headed brush. We have re-invented what the toothbrush should be...the future of oral care has arrived. 





 







Just Bite and Guide!

The unique
brush head configuration automatically simulates the preferred brushing method
recommended by dentists and periodontists (the Bass brushing technique).
30 Second
Smile has 6 micro-brush heads that comfortably surround your teeth in soft
bristles, automatically cleaning the top, bottom, front, back, and biting
surfaces, simultaneously. That's why brushing only 30 seconds is like brushing
2 minutes  or more with a single-headed toothbrush. And, its patented
""can't make a mistake"" design automatically positions the bristles at
the perfect 45-degree angle for powering away dangerous plaque, massaging gums,
and helping save your teeth.


All single-headed
toothbrushes, manual or powered, rotary or sonic, even those with feed-back
sensors, all share a common requirement of 2 minutes or more of user skill and
dexterity in order to deliver effective results. Many brushes provide timers to
encourage brushing for 2 minutes or more. Nevertheless, the average brushing
time is a mere 38 seconds, a significant factor when considering habits that
are contributing to poor oral health.
One can
reasonably assume that nothing is going to suddenly make people spend more time
brushing their teeth. And with regard to user skill, it is unlikely that people
will suddenly gain the skill needed to position toothbrushes correctly, thereby
improving oral cleansing results. Dental professionals have been diligently teaching
people how to use all sorts of toothbrushes for decades, yet statistics show
that there has been no real change in the incidence of cavities and gum
disease. 



30
Second Smile vs. Sonicare Diamond Clean


Yes,
we went up against the number one selling power toothbrush in a clinical trial.
How
did 30 Second Smile fare? Read for yourself:


The results of this clinical
study verify and support the hypothesis that “the 30SS used twice daily for 30
seconds is as effective as the SDC used twice daily for two minutes in
improving gingival health.” But more importantly: “By reducing the overall
brushing time to only 30 seconds, this study demonstrates that users of the
30SS can improve their gingival health
in a shorter brushing time. Considering that the average brushing time in
the general population is 37 seconds, the 30SS used for 30 seconds has the
potential to achieve improved gingival health with better compliance.”

You probably wouldn’t guess that gum disease is the MOST COMMON DISEASE in the world. Yep, there’s a chance your fancy $200 toothbrush is not doing its job. Why? Because you probably are not a dentist or hygienist. The difference between them and us is they are TRAINED to brush teeth and know the exact angles and brush strokes for most effective brushing habits, and most importantly, they are brushing for the right amount of time. The unique features of 30 Second Smile provide all the benefits of brushing properly, just as a dental professional would…all in just 30 seconds. 
Like many areas of the body, your mouth is
teeming with bacteria — most of them harmless. Normally the body's natural
defenses and good oral health care, such as daily brushing and flossing, can
keep these bacteria under control. However, without proper oral hygiene,
bacteria can reach levels that might lead to oral infections, such as tooth
decay and gum disease. According to the American Academy of Periodontology, gum disease has now been linked to diabetes, endocarditis, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, osteoporosis, and some cancers. There is a clear connection between oral health and systemic health. 
How can 30 Second Smile impact oral health globally? This toothbrush is the ONLY brush that can automatically brush your teeth properly, delivering excellent daily oral care, and resulting in great oral health. If 30 Second Smile becomes not only a “household name” but millions of users begin to experience the benefits of use, we can impact oral health worldwide.





We are a small business based in
Southern California. Our team is small, but mighty. For the past 10+ years we
have kept our business mainly “in the family”. Our Dad is the brains behind 30
Second Smile. After being diagnosed with gum disease, our Dad (KEN HEGEMANN) was determined to
find a solution and mitigate this problem. He has dedicated most of his adult
life to designing and perfecting a power toothbrush that is effective, safe, easy to
use, and eliminates human error. His work has been validated by over 15 patents
and numerous clinical studies proving its efficacy and superiority. By simply using 30 Second Smile, today he doesn't have a trace of gum disease. No deep cleaning, no surgery, no medication, just brushing with 30 Second Smile. 
His dream is for ALL
people, worldwide, to experience the improvement he had to his oral and systemic health by just brushing with 30 Second Smile.  The reward for helping us make it happen across the globe will be truly fulfilling for you PLUS if you a select a toothbrush perk, YOU will begin to change your own oral and over-all health. 







Let’s make something
clear. 30 Second Smile is not a brand new product. In fact, we have been
selling 30 Second Smile toothbrushes since 2010. The original model consisted
of the same brush head design we have today, but the handle required two AA
Batteries. We had two versions of that, one which included 2 AA Alkaline
batteries and one which included 2 AA NiMH rechargeable batteries plus a wall
charger. We sold these units through a test market for 3 years. We were very
successful in this market and wanted to expand so we continued to add to our
product line and designed an induction unit (one where you just place the
handle into the charging stand and the unit will automatically start charging).
We also added a UV Sanitizing unit with induction charging. 
Just
like any other successful company, we strive to listen to what our customers
want and then make changes accordingly in order to satisfy our customers.  
We have hundreds of positive testimonials from users and dental professionals. People love brushing with 30 Second Smile.

We have a sincere goal to make a difference worldwide not only for oral health but overall health. To move forward and really expand our product
line to reach millions of consumers WORLDWIDE, there are a few improvements and design
adjustments we need to implement.

WHAT'S A PERFECT SMILE WORTH TO YOU?











1. Will 30 Second Smile Fit in my mouth? 
Absolutely! 30 Second Smile is surprisingly comfortable. Here is how it compares to a regular toothbrush. 





2. Will 30 Second Smile cause Abrasion?
NOPE!  Automated Optimum Pressure PLUS Short Stroke = Zero Abrasion





Using traditional single headed brushes, you may often wonder how much
pressure you should be applying. Brushing too vigorously and / or with too much
pressure can cause abrasion, and can also cause the gums to recede and exposes
root surfaces. It also wears down the tooth structure. When using 30SS, it is
impossible to exert too much pressure or brush too vigorously, because the user
is exerting ZERO force. There is no abrasion because the short stroke action doesn't allow the bristles to move back and forth and sweep over the teeth and gums, instead the tips of the bristles make contact in one spot therefore touching and flex only the amount of the stroke. Additionally, the advanced, wrap-around head configuration provides
automated, EQUALIZED gentle pressure on the inner and outer surfaces. The
result: no chance of tooth or gum abrasion. The 'arms' of the
brush head flex, to provide the perfect pressure for both the front (thinner)
teeth, as well as the molars. The resilient arms provide a pressure that is not
too aggressive to cause abrasion. With all other brushes, the pressure applied
by user can be too high.  1/4""
stroke vs 1"" with a manual brush.3. Does 30 Second Smile use
Sonic technology?
No, 30 Second Smile  is a totally new technology. Toothbrushes have been around for a long time, and unfortunately, so have cavities and gum disease. The primary cause of cavities and gum disease is improper brushing (human error). Numerous studies show that if a person brushes properly and removes the bacterial plaque from the teeth and along the gum lines, they will significantly reduce the potential for cavities or gum disease.
The secret to high quality oral care is not bristles moving at ""Sonic Speed"". The solution is to use the proper technique to ensure every surface of every tooth is cleansed and the gums properly massaged.  “Can’t make a mistake” technology by 30 Second Smile automatically ensures proper oral care with its patented microbrushes, each and every use. You simply bite and guide, and receive the level of oral care you need, in 1/4th the time required by all other power toothbrushes, and 1/6th the time of any manual brush.

4. Is 30 Second Smile safe
for children, and does it require any special brushes?
Not
only do we have special brushes specifically designed for kids, but clinical studies have shown 30
Second Smile to be totally safe for anyone
seeking a higher quality of oral hygiene. We hear from parents all the time,
who tell us their kids love using 30 Second Smile. More
importantly, parents tell us that they love 30 Second Smile because they no
longer have to stand over their children to make sure they are properly
brushing their teeth.
They
tell us, ""If I hear the 30 Second Smile, I know my child is getting proper
oral care.""  And that is what we
call, ""The 30 Second Smile Difference.""  With 30 Second Smile, kids receive a proper
brushing; with other products they (and often their parents) have to do the
work. The patented multi-micro heads are ideal for children's use. They are
small enough to easily fit into their mouth, and 30 Second Smile is safe and
easy to use.

5. How often do I need to
replace the heads?
Brush
heads should be replaced every 90 days. This is an industry-wide standard because
after a few months, bristles start to become splayed and frayed, and consequently
become much less effective over time.  
Not
only are old brush-heads ineffective, they may harbor harmful bacteria. Sick
people should change their brush-heads at the beginning of an illness and after
they feel better.

6. How will 30 Second Smile
benefit my family?
30
Second Smile is ideal for all members of the family - young children (ages 5+), teens,
college students, adults and aging adults. Oral care is a vital part of our
overall health.  In fact, the US Surgeon
General stated in 2003, ""If your mouth is not healthy, your body will not
be healthy.""  With 30 Second
Smile, every member of your family will receive proper oral care daily. Often times, aging adults may have
a problem using a traditional toothbrush to properly brush.  30 Second Smile will do the job for them.  And that means whiter teeth, healthier gums,
fresher breath, and better overall health for all family members.  It also means a better partnership with your
dental professional. And while this can
mean great savings in dental bills, the ultimate prize is better health and
a family with bright, beautiful, healthy smiles.

7. Do I need toothpaste?
All
you need is to apply a pea-sized dollop of toothpaste to each side
(top and bottom), right where the angled bristles meet.  The toothpaste applied via the effective
brushing action of 30 Second Smile will assist in removing the bacterial plaque and stains. 

8. How can I clean my
tongue?
30
Second Smile comes with a tongue cleaner. 

9. Can I use only one head?
No.
 It is essential that both heads are used, because the
movement of each head reciprocates and  balances the movement of the other,
making it possible for all six surfaces of the teeth to be cleaned
simultaneously while also massaging the gums.  
The
brush heads attach to the handle via metal pins.  If both heads are not attached, one of the
pins would be exposed, and will cause damage to the teeth or gums.

10. Braces - does it clean
effectively around and under braces?
We
have an Orthodontic-specific brush head.  Most
people who wear braces find it difficult to maneuver a conventional
single-headed brush around the braces. The 30 Second Smile Ortho head makes the task easy and effective. See video demo:


11. Can I take it in the
shower?
Using 30 Second Smile in the shower will void the warranty. 

12. My gums are bleeding! What's happening?    
Believe
it or not this is not a bad sign. Prior to using 30 Second Smile, most people do not
take the time nor exercise the dexterity to maneuver a single headed power or
manual brush in such a way that they clean all surfaces of the teeth and
massage the gums. When the teeth are not properly cleansed and the gums are not massaged,  the gums can become inflamed or infected. 
30
Second Smile is designed to reach the neglected or hard to reach areas of the
gums. As a result, the user can experience some bleeding when these inflamed or
infected areas are stimulated, during the first two or three days of use. 
With continued use of 30 Second Smile, the neglected area(s) of the gums will be
restored to health, and bleeding and any discomfort (which is negligible) will
cease. To assist you in restoring your gums to a higher level of health, every 30
Second Smile comes with Ultra Soft RED BRISTLES. The Ultra Soft Red Bristles
should be used initially while 30 Second Smile restores your gums to health.
After that, you can use the Standard Soft Brushes for a more penetrating
cleansing of the teeth and gum massage.

13. Can 30 Second Smile cause gum recession?
No.  Most people have some level of
gingivitis which is the early stage of gum disease.  Due to plaque
irritation and infection of the gum tissue, swelling and inflammation may be
present prior to using 30 Second
Smile.  When infected, the gum tissue often feels and appears to be red,
spongy, or puffy.  The amazing cleaning qualities of 30 Second Smile will
penetrate under the gums and between the teeth much better.  As a result,
you may experience bleeding initially for several days… up to perhaps a
week.  After this time, the swelling will likely go down, and thus the
gums will become pink, tight, and healthier. 
As gum inflammation is reduced, it reveals more of the tooth, which
should not be confused with gum recession. 
This is gum restoration to better health.

14. Can I use this brush with crowns and bridges?
There
are two types of ""bridges"": fixed, and removable.  A fixed partial denture is a
""bridge""  and is permanently cemented in the mouth to replace
missing teeth; a removable partial denture is a ""partial"" and
can be placed in and taken out.
Because
it is retained by metal clasps around the teeth, our dental professional
associates advice is for users is to remove
the bridge before using 30 Second Smile, to prevent dislodging of the
partial and to prevent the bristles from getting caught under the retention
clasps, and coming out.

15. Which brush head is right for me?
-Kids
should use the brush specifically designed for kids.  First-time users should start with the Ultra
Soft (red) brushes.
- Red bristles identify the Ultra
Soft head…designed for 1st time users, and users with sensitive teeth and/or
gums.  These brushes should be used when you initially start using 30 Second Smile.
- Light-blue bristles identify the
Soft heads - delivering less sensitive users a good cleaning while remaining
gentle
- Extra Reach has an extra row of
bristles, enabling users with gum recession (or larger teeth) to still clean
the gumline.  Users without recession report superior gum stimulation as a
result of the extra row of bristles reaching higher on the gums.

16. Are the bristles soft?
Yes
- in fact, our standard soft is softer than typical soft brushes found on other
toothbrushes.  We also have an Ultra Soft
brush for people with very sensitive gums.

17. Color in the bristles -
what is it made from?
All
bristle colors used comply with US Federal Drug Administration Regulation 21
CFR 178.3297 - colorant levels below 1% by weight and no heavy metal based
pigments. All plastics and filaments have been tested for extraction and no
significant colorant extraction shown. All colors comply with all applicable
standards in Europe and to the US Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.

18. Is the technology patented?
We currently have fifteen issued patents and four pending patent applications. This strong foundation will help us reach global markets. 




As with any project, there are inherent risks. We have developed a high-level mitigation strategy to reduce the probability of occurrence. 

Risk: Production costs of the final product will be too high. 
Mitigation:  We are establishing two vendors for the product in our supply chain. This will keep the cost low via a competitive atmosphere. In addition, we are building multi-cavity tooling that will certainly reduce our overall cost of goods.
Risk: Tooling development will take longer than expected. 
Mitigation:  We have experience with the single-cavity tooling that produced prior versions of the product. We will replicate those test molds by duplicating the successful cavity design within the multi-cavity molds.  In addition, we will utilize mold-flow analysis software tools to predict as near as possible, the efficiency of the multi-cavity molds.
Risk: Product will not pass quality control standards. 
Mitigation: Hydrabrush Inc. (manufacturer of 30 Second Smile) is a fully certified ISO 13485 company.  We intend to utilize every tool at our disposal as mandated within our ISO quality assurance capabilities to mitigate manufacturing error.  As well, we will demand that our supply line vendors adhere to our strict ISO 13485 quality guidelines.",23.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>So, while my

<p>That’s when
I decided to consult with nutritionists. The answers I kept hearing were calming,
anti-inflammatory, and high level antioxidant teas like Jasmine, Hibiscus, Passion
Flower, Rose, and Cloves. I noticed they were all flowers. </p>
<p>I began
researching and found that flowers provide antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
levels many, many times higher than the most potent fruits and berries, AND many, many times more powerful than any
vitamin as well.</p>
<p>This is much more
powerful than the most potent berries (Blueberries, Pomegranate, and Acai) and
with none of the drawbacks. </p>
<p>Flowers have
none of the high sugar content and calories associated with berry juices. So,
the delicious revitalizing vitality and life-extending power of flowers can be

don’t have any sugars or calories, they're perfect for people who are sensitive to these issues, such as

<p>So you may
ask yourself, with such an obvious and powerful new breakthrough in health and

the formulation, designed the logos and labels, and secured packaging
with little to no funding with lots of industry encouragement and support. </p>
<p>There are,
however, two specific areas that will require funding we don’t yet have. We
have secured the commitment of distribution firms that will ship and put us in
primary test markets in stores like Whole Foods and Sprouts. This will require building out a large product supply on the front end which entails a
significant capital investment. Also, the amount of flowers needed to supply
mass production for nationwide distribution could be a challenge. </p>
<p>Until this
point, there has been no reason for wide spread consumption of flower-based
products. The small organic flower farms that produce the high quality product
we are including in Powerful Flowers have other clients they would have to
turn away if they provided their flowers to us. To do that they want us to make
a large buy-in commitment.</p>
<p>So, there
are some hurdles we have to overcome to begin widespread distribution. We believe it is worth it because most
importantly we believe the most revolutionary and powerful step forward in
health, vitality and longevity is here. </p>

our super efficient society, the Bible seems to be the last thing to catch
up.  We can have an international meeting
with the click of a button, we can mass message our friends and family, and we
can have live streaming video almost anywhere we need it, but when it comes to
the reading the Bible, the answer is not so simple.   The Bible should act as
our guiding light as we go about our day. 
And when all is said and done many of us are not using the Bible as much
as we want and need to.Overview
Our popular culture reinforces the idea
that our faith is needed now more than ever in our society full of distractions.
We're out to give people a positive outlook and place to turn when they need it
most, one“BibleBerry” at a time! The BibleBerry is a hand-held, portable,
touchscreen gadget preloaded with the entire script, visuals and audio of the
Christian Bible. The ""BibleBerry"" has a cover, which makes it look like the Holy
Bible and gives a sacred outfit. Help us establish this initiative to serve people
in need of a solution. As little as $39 gets a“BibleBerry” to an
individual and can change their ideas about what
they can accomplish for the rest of his or her life.  Finding out the Bible is with you at all
times with ease will be life changing. Empower us to make this vision a
reality with a donation to this project today!FeaturesThe ""BibleBerry"" device has an alarm feature which wakes up the user with a daily Bible verse. Additionally, the smart calendar allows the user to listen to the entire Bible in one year.The first version of ""BibleBerry"" is offered with the King James Version. Later users can connect through Wi-Fi and update to different Bible versions of their choice. The ""BibleBerry"" may also be played through two accessories: a set of portable speakers or a Bluetooth that allows the user to listen while traveling.""BibleBerry"" offers two versions - BibleBerry M500 and BibleBerry S330, a lighter version.ComparisonAbout UsHello everyone! My name is Denis Cyriac, CEO and founder of the iDearays and I am the creator of ""BibleBerry."" We are committed to our mission statement of spreading the gospel with this exciting new modern technology. Our goal is to make it easier for people to access and use their Bibles on a daily basis. BibleBerry has:

BibleBerry – An elegant and impressive Christmas gift
The BibleBerry is an essential mobile gadget for family, unique present for kids and a valuable device for the elderly.  It is a wonderful gift for those who would like to be closer to God.We are working hard to release ""BibleBerry"" by November 15, 2015 – just in time for the holidays. 
BibleBerry – A soul mate while you travel
God is near and so is His Word. When you wake up, are at work, while you travel, or before you go to sleep the Word of God is with you; it becomes an important part of your daily life.
BibleBerry – Do not compare it with a mobile phone
There is no comparison between a mobile phone and the Holy Bible.  Unlike mobile phones, the ""BibleBerry""is a sacred device which has no sim-card, social applications, emails or SMS to distract users while reading or listening to the Bible passages.
How You Can Help
For us to bring the ""BibleBerry"" to life, we need your support!
Your generous funding will help us get things started in order to realize our concept. It will assist us with the cost of further development, manufacturing and production. More importantly, you get the chance to be one of the first users of the ""BibleBerry."" We will also use our funding to test our concept to make it better.  We are committed to continuous improvement so we are always giving people the best possible solutions.
We will also be using the funding to expand the possibilities for the consumers usage, to enterprise solutions for the ""BibleBerry,"" to further customize the first versions of the ""BibleBerry"" and to create additional products and services that will complement the ""BibleBerry.""
The ""BibleBerry"" needs pledging but above all, it needs your attention and interest! If you love this product as much as we do then please take a moment to click on one of our social media buttons (Facebook, Twitter and YouTube at the bottom of the page).

</h1><ol>
<li><b>Why is it called
	The Elimbinator? Because it Eliminates brush, tree cuttings,
	leaves and tree limbs and virtually any cellulose fiber
	material you can stuff into it.</b></li>
<li><b>Why would I need
	this device? The
	Elimbinator can save the average homeowner
	thousands of dollars over its lifetime. In fact: It pays for itself
	in one use. </b></li>
<li>
<b>How does it pay
	for itself? Three ways: a. When you cut your lawn and trim your
	trees and shrubs, you are left with all of the cuttings. You
	normally rake them up and pay to dispose of them. b. You can spend
	$500.00 plus for a chipper/shredder, grind up it up in big chunks
	and either build a compost or have it hauled away. Labor and money
	thrown away.  c. But most of all, you just paid to have that biomass
	with all of its nutrients to be discarded. The
	Elimbinator turns it into fine particles that
	go right back into your lawn where it decomposes and feeds the lawn
	with those nutrients. Why buy fertilizer when you create your own?
	You already have it. Stop throwing it away. </b>
</li>
<li>
<b></b><b>Why not just buy
	a chipper/shredder? A small fair quality chipper/shredder cost (At a
	minimum) around $500.00. </b><b>The
	Elimbinator</b><b> cost less than 1/20</b><sup><b>th</b></sup><b>
	of that and the chipper/shredder can only grind up the trimmings. 
	Don’t even attempt to feed a banana leaf or a palm fron into a
	conventional shredder. It will completely clog it up and you will
	have to take it apart to repair it. You can build a smelly compost
	in the corner of your yard, if you have enough room, but the
	expensive chipper/shredder can’t grind your trimmings into dust so
	it can immediately feed your yard. You also have to have the room to
	store the machine and you have the extra cost of maintaining the
	equipment. </b><b>The
	Elimbinator</b><b>  sits on your mower and takes up NO
	space and requires NO maintenance.</b><b> </b>
</li>
<li>
<b></b><b>Is it built to
	last? </b><b>The
	Elimbinator</b><b> is constructed of a Space age solid
	Polycarbonate composite that is virtually indestructible. It won’t
	corrode or break and will outlast your lawnmower. In fact: It can be
	removed and reinstalled on your next mower and  the one after that.</b><b> </b>
</li>
<li>
<b>What can it
	shred? It will shred any cellulous based material that can be fed
	into it. Anything from: A banana leaf to the hardest wood you can
	find. If you want to shred your homework or your Love letters and
	turn them into fine confetti, you can do that too. Just roll them up
	like a newspaper and feed them in.</b><b> </b>
</li>
<li>
<b></b><b>Does it require
	any maintenance? NO</b><b> </b>
</li>
<li>
<b></b><b>How safe is it?
	It is designed so that hands or fingers will not reach any dangerous
	portion of The Elimbinator or your lawnmower. This device has been
	under R&amp;D since 2004 without a single mishap. If you notice in
	the video, the operator’s fingers are put into the device as far
	as they can reach. This is in no way, recommended, but it is an
	example of how well designed </b><b>The
	Elimbinator</b><b> is.</b><b> </b>
</li>
<li>
<b></b><b>Will it do the
	same with leaves? With the optional attachment it will. In South
	Florida, where it was originally developed it is a veritable
	necessity. leaves fall year around and must be dealt with every time
	you cut your lawn. Especially palm trees.</b>
</li>
<li>
<b> </b><b>Can this be
	useful to a Professional Lawn Service? By employing </b><b>The
	Elimbinator</b><b>, it alleviates, in most instances,
	the need to haul away and dispose of almost all lawn debris, thus
	eliminating the extra expense of a dump truck or trailer to haul it
	away to a commercial landfill. </b><b>The
	Elimbinator </b><b>was developed by a Professional to
	solve a real problem that he encountered every day. He solved that
	problem by inventing </b><b>The
	Elimbinator </b><b>and saved tens of thousands of
	dollars in his own business.</b><b> </b>
</li>
<li>
<b></b><b>Is it difficult
	to install? </b><b>The
	Elimbinator</b><b> comes with very simple and easy to
	follow installation instructions and directs you to a UTube video
	that shows you everything you would ever need to know about
	installation and proper use. You may choose the optional “Easy
	Install Kit” that contains everything you need (Drill not
	included) Or, if you are handy with tools, you may already have the
	essentials to do it yourself.  Either way, it is a simple install.</b>
</li>
<li>
<h4>
<b>Why don’t I have one? Good question. Why not?? If you cut your
	own lawn, or if you are a Professional and want to have a decisive
	edge over the competition, </b><b>The
	Elimbinator </b><b>is the ultimate answer to your
	need. It </b><b>Elimbinates
	</b><b>your yard debris and turns it into a useful and
	nutrient enriched biodegradable product for your lawn. Leave the
	landfill to trash and  garbage. They have enough to deal with and
	your paying through the nose to get rid of it. Save the useful
	nutrients to take care of your own lawn.</b><b> </b>

Virtually Maintenance Free

industry
For Pennies on the Dollar
Virtually maintenance Free

And Built to Outlast Your
Mower
(See the FAQ below for
more details)_____________________________________________________________________________
Questions You Might Ask



The Elimbinator

Why is it called
	The Elimbinator? Because it Eliminates brush, tree cuttings,
	leaves and tree limbs and virtually any cellulose fiber
	material you can stuff into it.
Why would I need
	this device? The
	Elimbinator can save the average homeowner
	thousands of dollars over its lifetime. In fact: It pays for itself
	in one use. 

How does it pay
	for itself? Three ways: a. When you cut your lawn and trim your
	trees and shrubs, you are left with all of the cuttings. You
	normally rake them up and pay to dispose of them. b. You can spend
	$500.00 plus for a chipper/shredder, grind up it up in big chunks
	and either build a compost or have it hauled away. Labor and money
	thrown away.  c. But most of all, you just paid to have that biomass
	with all of its nutrients to be discarded. The
	Elimbinator turns it into fine particles that
	go right back into your lawn where it decomposes and feeds the lawn
	with those nutrients. Why buy fertilizer when you create your own?
	You already have it. Stop throwing it away. 


Why not just buy
	a chipper/shredder? A small fair quality chipper/shredder cost (At a
	minimum) around $500.00. The
	Elimbinator cost less than 1/20th
	of that and the chipper/shredder can only grind up the trimmings. 
	Don’t even attempt to feed a banana leaf or a palm fron into a
	conventional shredder. It will completely clog it up and you will
	have to take it apart to repair it. You can build a smelly compost
	in the corner of your yard, if you have enough room, but the
	expensive chipper/shredder can’t grind your trimmings into dust so
	it can immediately feed your yard. You also have to have the room to
	store the machine and you have the extra cost of maintaining the
	equipment. The
	Elimbinator  sits on your mower and takes up NO
	space and requires NO maintenance. 


Is it built to
	last? The
	Elimbinator is constructed of a Space age solid
	Polycarbonate composite that is virtually indestructible. It won’t
	corrode or break and will outlast your lawnmower. In fact: It can be
	removed and reinstalled on your next mower and  the one after that. 


What can it
	shred? It will shred any cellulous based material that can be fed
	into it. Anything from: A banana leaf to the hardest wood you can
	find. If you want to shred your homework or your Love letters and
	turn them into fine confetti, you can do that too. Just roll them up
	like a newspaper and feed them in. 


Does it require
	any maintenance? NO 


How safe is it?
	It is designed so that hands or fingers will not reach any dangerous
	portion of The Elimbinator or your lawnmower. This device has been
	under R&D since 2004 without a single mishap. If you notice in
	the video, the operator’s fingers are put into the device as far
	as they can reach. This is in no way, recommended, but it is an
	example of how well designed The
	Elimbinator is. 


Will it do the
	same with leaves? With the optional attachment it will. In South
	Florida, where it was originally developed it is a veritable
	necessity. leaves fall year around and must be dealt with every time
	you cut your lawn. Especially palm trees.


 Can this be
	useful to a Professional Lawn Service? By employing The
	Elimbinator, it alleviates, in most instances,
	the need to haul away and dispose of almost all lawn debris, thus
	eliminating the extra expense of a dump truck or trailer to haul it
	away to a commercial landfill. The
	Elimbinator was developed by a Professional to
	solve a real problem that he encountered every day. He solved that
	problem by inventing The
	Elimbinator and saved tens of thousands of
	dollars in his own business. 


Is it difficult
	to install? The
	Elimbinator comes with very simple and easy to
	follow installation instructions and directs you to a UTube video
	that shows you everything you would ever need to know about
	installation and proper use. You may choose the optional “Easy
	Install Kit” that contains everything you need (Drill not
	included) Or, if you are handy with tools, you may already have the
	essentials to do it yourself.  Either way, it is a simple install.



Why don’t I have one? Good question. Why not?? If you cut your
	own lawn, or if you are a Professional and want to have a decisive
	edge over the competition, The
	Elimbinator is the ultimate answer to your
	need. It Elimbinates
	your yard debris and turns it into a useful and
	nutrient enriched biodegradable product for your lawn. Leave the
	landfill to trash and  garbage. They have enough to deal with and
	your paying through the nose to get rid of it. Save the useful
	nutrients to take care of your own lawn.

<p>Administrations to physically impaired kids initiated in 1985
with the backing of Terre des Hommes (TDH) of Switzerland. In 1992, the
responsibility for project was exchanged to the Friends of the Disabled (FOD),
a Nepalese non-administrative association. The FOD has been constantly
endeavoring to contact more kids with a far reaching, excellent bundle of
administrations which are healing facility and also group based and spread out
through numerous regions of the nation.</p>

<p>5,425 (2,220 girls) new patients and 12,529 (4,803 girls)
existing patients were seen (in the Hospital and in addition in the field) in
2012. 861 patient documents were inactivated before the end of 2012. </p>
<p>Inpatient Services </p>
<p>With the suggestion of our medical team, inpatient

<p>A dollar can certainly go a long way, but a few more can go further:</p>
<ul>
<li>After the Earthquake struck on 25 April, 2015, our
     entire community hsd been in turmoil. The devastation extended thoughtout the
     country and many have been found dead. More and more bodies are turning up
     daily, bringing the current ""death toll"" to exceed 7,000. It is
     without a doubt that aid is needed for the people of Nepal. The land is in
     ruins, and the people are in pain. Those that are still alive, that is. We
     are seeking to raise 500,000 United States Dollars to rebuild our
     hospital. The patients of the <b>HOSPITAL &amp; REHABILITATION CENTER FOR
     DISABLED CHILDREN (HRDC) @27.629529, 85.508982</b>  need your help.</li>
<li>Your generous donations will go to providing Food and
     Clean Drinking Water to the Nepalese people. Aside from the immediate need
     of Food, the people of Nepal are also in need of Shelter.</li>
<li>Rescue and salvage is
     running and emergency plans are being situated. However, the valley and
     Kathmandu region especially will languish over quite a while and will need
     reconstruction after the first weeks have passed. Individuals have lost
     relatives, their homes and the base of their pay. After first medical
     consideration has been conveyed it will take huge endeavors to re-create
     group life back to the country. </li>

citizens to help clean the region around the towns from debris and to
support them in reconstructing their homes and foundation.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>The need for aid is enormous. It is without question that
immediate assistance is required, and this assistance must be ongoing in order
to see the positive change needed. Whether you are donating $100, $500. $1,000
or even $50, it is astounding when you realize just how the difference your
contribution will make:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unoriginal as it may feel, money gifts are constantly
     best. Numerous liberal hearts have been moved by the rising loss of life
     here in Nepal, and the gigantic needs of the survivors. Much thanks to you
     for caring and wanting to help the cause. Food and clothing gifts sent
     freely from the US and Canada can stop up what one of my Nepalese
     associates called ""a three-inch supply line, when a 30-foot one is
     required."" And while volunteers can help, its best to do this from
     the US &amp; Canada, bringing issues to light of the catastrophe and
     trusts for the survivors, instead of heading out to the field oneself.
     Help specialists on the ground here in Nepal must concentrate on the needs
     of those survivors, instead of arranging even the best-hearted volunteers.</li>
<li>Indeed, even in life-and-death circumstances,
     disaster-response can require some time invested. There's an inclination
     to expect that absence of cash is the main stumbling block in emergency
     response. At the same time, natural disasters are, by their extremely
     nature, complex. Numerous factors can slow progress more than anybody
     would like, including destroyed airplane terminals, seaports and streets,
     constrained infrastructure/foundation in an impoverished nation, or even
     the vicinity of help associations that aren't a piece of the in general,
     composed exertion. Try not to get discouraged in the event that you
     donate, then keep on seeing disturbing news stories about individuals in
     need. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">Help is overcoming, and aid WILL get through.</span>
</li>
<li>Your assistance is necessary for the Children and
     Families in Nepal. The Government of Canada is coordinating gifts until
     May 25, significance anything you give will be doubled size. The United
     States Government has a similar matched incentive with no expiration.
     Whether your blessing sustains a ravenous family in Nepal, modifies the
     home of kids, staffs a kid neighborly space so traumatized kids can get
     counseling, or helps a parent re-build their occupation and livelihood,
     your donated cash gift will help in an exceptionally personal way.</li>

<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>

<p>First and foremost, donated funds for Nepal will go to

cleanliness, and emergency care for the injured. Taking after the initial quake
after-shocks, repercussions have kept on wracking the area, and people have
been sleeping outside in avoid more buildings collapsing and more structures

<li>How would I know my gift to
     Nepal will be well spent? When you provide for disaster relief in
     Nepal, we will keep you updated as the endeavors proceed. Indeed, even
     after the beginning emergency passes, remaking endeavors will require some
     investment. It will take years to recoup from this catastrophe, and the
     requirement for funds is immediate. </li>

Canopy. May is the Skin Cancer Awareness of Month and we at Infinity Canopy would
like to help raise funds and awareness for Camp Sundown and 
Xeroderma Pigmentosum Society as well as create a shaded patio area for the campers and their families. People affected by XP are the most vulnerable to Skin Cancer
from normal Sun Exposure. People with XP are just like you. The biggest
difference is that they can’t go out and
play at all during daylight hours. Even a
small amount of sun exposure can lead to skin ulcers and skin cancer. There is
no cure for XP.  
Camp Sundown also serves
kids and their families suffering from other forms of
Sun Sensitivity including Solar Urticaria, Porphyria, Vitiligo, Albinism and
related conditions who can be outdoors in a shaded area. Camp Sundown  has a large outdoor area that is devoid of

a new product for treatment of pain that is unlike any other treatment
available. Instant Relief Pain Spray (IPRS) is a completely new breakthrough for
stopping pain in muscles, skin, and sometimes even in arthritic joints. It’s
not a pill, and it doesn’t require getting an injection or rubbing on a lotion.
This is a way of treating pain that has never been done before. All that’s
required is for the user to spray the affected area, and the pain <i>disappears completely</i> in seconds; relief
can last for up to 24 hours.</p><p>
</p><p>We’ve tested this product on literally
hundreds of subjects and it worked on <i>every
one</i> of them. That’s right, <i>every one
of them had their pain completely canceled</i> within seconds after spraying
with IPRS … and <i>the relief lasted for up
to a full day.</i></p>
<p>My wife had back pain from an auto
accident over 20 years ago. It took strong narcotic drugs to partially ease her
pain, but it never went away completely, and the drugs left her with some nasty
side effects—she was sleeping about 15 hours out of every 24, and when she was
awake, she was groggy and not really “in the moment.” </p>
<p>I did some research and tried many different
methods to ease her pain and bring her back to her former lively self, and it
took a while, but after finally hitting on the formula for IPRS, she sprayed
her lower back with IPRS and her pain stopped <i>completely</i> in a few seconds. Just think of that—doctors couldn’t
stop her pain in <i>16 years!</i> After 4
years, she still sprays her back every day and remains <i>pain free.</i> That’s the reason I made every effort to let others try
it in a field test. It passed with flying colors!<span> </span></p>
<p>A
few of the pains IPRS has treated:</p>
<ul>
<li>Chronic backache </li>
<li>Sore muscles</li>
<li>Shoulder pain </li>
<li>Knee pain (spray behind the knee)</li>
<li>Neck ache/stiff neck </li>
<li>Aching legs </li>
<li>Arthritic joints </li>
<li>Tired, sore feet </li>
<li>Sunburn</li>
<li>Aggravating itch from poison ivy/poison oak</li>
<li>Minor skin abrasions</li>
</ul>
<p>In
fact, we had one test subject with shingles who was also pregnant, so she
couldn’t take strong painkillers for fear of affecting her unborn baby. She
used IPRS, spraying where the nerves were inflamed, and managed to get relief
and comfort from the spray without endangering her baby. </p>
<p>This is a just a partial list of some of the maladies that were treated
successfully with IPRS. We suspect that as time goes by, many more will be
found.</p>
<p>IPRS
has no side effects or drugs; in fact, the ingredients are beneficial to your
body. That’s what makes it so effective. It has no aftereffects, it won’t react
with any other drugs you take, and it won’t trigger any allergy. It has no odor
and it won’t stain your clothes. In short, <i>there
is no downside to this product.</i> IPRS is a completely new and innovative way
to defeat pain. There is nothing to compare to it. Once you try it, you’ll
never return to using prescription drugs or over the counter painkillers, both
of which can lead to serious organ damage. </p>
<p>Our
goal is to make as many people aware of IPRS as we possibly can. We want to
educate them to the fact that pain control is now so easy to manage that it’s
almost an afterthought.</p>
<p>We
feel so strongly about IPRS that we <i>guarantee</i>
it will work for you if you suffer from one of the ailments listed here. If you
aren’t satisfied, if it truly didn’t give you the relief you seek, just send an
email to the the address below and we’ll make arrangements to return your
money. But when it does work, email and tell us about that too. Tell us if you
relieved a pain we don’t include in our list. We look forward to hearing from
all our clients. </p>

the results from two test subjects: </p>
<p><i>Gail V., of Carrollton, Ohio,</i> <i>says:</i>
“My back hurt me every day for years. My doctor gave me injections of
cortisone, but it only partially eased my pain, I still hurt a lot A friend
sprayed IPRS on my back. The pain stopped completely in seconds! Then I played
18 holes of golf and I never felt even a twinge of pain. It didn’t start
hurting me until the next morning, so I got some IPRS and sprayed it again.
Same result—no more pain! Now I spray every morning and my back never hurts me.
I’m on my third bottle now and I’m never going to run out of this stuff!”</p>
<p><i>Nancy B., of Strasburg, Ohio, says: </i>“I’m a clerk in a liquor store and I’m
on hard floors all day. My Achilles’ tendon got so sore that I couldn’t
wear shoes. I wore flip-flops for years because my tendons were so sore. About
a year ago, I found out about IPRS and sprayed my foot with it. The pain
stopped almost immediately! Now I can wear my shoes without pain. I’m <i>never</i>
going to run out of this stuff! In fact, I’m so happy with IPRS that I’ve
started selling it myself, and I have a number of satisfied customers!”</p>
<p>These
two people had suffered pain for so long that they were almost ready to give
up. Gale had serious back pain for years; Nancy had suffered for 5 years with
her Achilles’ tendon. Both of them got immediate relief with IPRS. They said
that IPRS was the only treatment that ever worked for them. </p>
<p><i>They still use it.</i></p>
<p>We
realize that this is hard to believe.
Everyone here—myself included—had to see IPRS completely stop pain a number of
times before they came to believe we had made a major breakthrough in
alleviating pain. When you spray yourself the first time with IPRS, you’ll be a
believer too. </p>
<p>Whatever
you do, don’t pass up this opportunity to live your life free of pain. Don’t
suffer another day with discomfort that can be stopped with a few sprays of
IPRS. <i>It’s just not necessary.</i> </p>

your pain. Believe me, you've never seen anything like this!<p></p><div>

I had professional experience in leading investment banks in İstanbul and during the financial crisis, I moved to Shanghai as an entrepreneur in 2009. In 2010, I returned to Ankara and continued entrepreneurial and business projects between Turkey and China. </p>
<p>When I was 10 years old, I started suffering from a life long disease: kidney failure... In 1992, after a short period of hemodialysis, I witnessed a miracle and had a kidney transplantation, which enabled me to accomplish all above mentioned career achievements. For 20 years, I had a relatively normal life. However, in 2012, my new kidney stopped and I returned to dialysis again. This time peritoneal dialysis...</p>
<p>Currently, like 200,000 people increasing at a 3% rate every year across the globe, I have to do peritoneal dialysis 4 times a day. Every single day... My health is stable however, it makes my travels extremely difficult, which is not nice at all in today's mobile world...</p>
<p>During this process I realised that a commercial portable IV pole is not available in the marketplace.

I had professional experience in leading investment banks in İstanbul and during the financial crisis, I moved to Shanghai as an entrepreneur in 2009. In 2010, I returned to Ankara and continued entrepreneurial and business projects between Turkey and China. 
When I was 10 years old, I started suffering from a life long disease: kidney failure... In 1992, after a short period of hemodialysis, I witnessed a miracle and had a kidney transplantation, which enabled me to accomplish all above mentioned career achievements. For 20 years, I had a relatively normal life. However, in 2012, my new kidney stopped and I returned to dialysis again. This time peritoneal dialysis...
Currently, like 200,000 people increasing at a 3% rate every year across the globe, I have to do peritoneal dialysis 4 times a day. Every single day... My health is stable however, it makes my travels extremely difficult, which is not nice at all in today's mobile world...
During this process I realised that a commercial portable IV pole is not available in the marketplace. An IV pole is not only used by peritoneal dialysis patients but also in many applications, where IV treatment is necessary: mobile hospitals, regular hospitals, doctors clinics and all kinds of self IV treatment patients. 
For this reason together with Prof. Hakan Gürsu from Middle East Technical University, we designed the first most beautiful portable IV pole. 
Prof. Gürsu is well known across the globe and received 7 Green Dot Awards, which is one of the few most prestigious design awards in the world. 
In order to commercialise the product, we received prototype and serial production quotations from a Chinese manufacturer. 
In this first stage, we would like to have the prototype manufactured by the factory and test it. In the second stage, we will enable marketing channels and enter serial production with the next round larger investment.  
Our goal is to commercialise and present the useful portable IV pole for the peritoneal dialysis and other IV treatment patients. We would like to make those patients' lives easier by enabling them to travel easier without sacrificing quality of their inevitable treatments. 

The prototype will enable us to start negotiations with medical companies for marketing 
Your support will contribute to the very difficult lives of peritoneal and other regular IV treatment patients across the globe 
   What is required? Goals:  Create awareness and crowd finance for portable IV pole prototype manufacturing 
Create awareness for the second stage larger investment for serial production
Present a useful product to make difficult lives easier and contribute to the well being of humanity 
Present an opportunity to help to those in need
Create awareness through crowd funding and social media sharing of the project
Create and commercialise the world's first most beautiful portable IV pole together
In all cases, success or failure, make sure that the funds collected are used for the benefit of those patients in need
   Impact The prototype will be a step to our tests and serial production.   Your support will make difficult lives easier 
You will support a design created by one of the world's leading designers from the Middle East Technical University 
You will contribute to the well being of not only peritoneal dialysis patients, who have to do dialysis 4 times every day, but also other regular IV treatment patients across the planet, and who knows, perhaps even in other planets one day, given that it is a truly portable product    Risks & Challenges The current challenge we face for the commercialisation of the product is costs of serial production and marketing. After prototype we will be able to negotiate with medical companies for marketing channels. 
We have also started working on the intellectual property rights to secure the design of the product. International protection is costly. 
We are trying to solve these problems by:  We have received quotations and determined an alternative Chinese manufacturer for the prototype and serial production
For legal issues and protection of intellectual property rights, we have agreed to cooperate with Middle East Technical University Teknokent, who provide us with a leading legal and patent consulting firm for this purpose.      Things you can do Providing potential investors and clients are always welcome. Business connections and introduction of the project to international medical companies are also appreciated.  We ask you to get the word out and share our campaign

<br/>The Beginnings</h1><p>it all started 4 years ago with a simple idea: energy yogurt. Why wasn't there an energy yogurt? The two major industries of yogurt and energy drinks combined into 1 product. Sounds simple, right? A company was formed and the process began to develop an energy yogurt and bring it to market...it was harder than we thought. We were close to giving up, thinking that the reason there was not an energy yogurt on the market was simply because it couldn't be done.</p><h1>
<br/>The Catalyst</h1><p>Not long after the company was formed and incorporated, Ryan's mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. We work in a hospital as nurse anesthetists and have seen hundreds, if not thousands, of patients being treated for breast cancer. It was a lot different when it was his own mother. In just 2 short months he suddenly found himself at her bedside in a hospice. The cancer was very aggressive and had spread to her lungs. The day before she passed away he told her about our idea of an energy yogurt. He promised her that not only was he going to make it happen, but he was going to make it happen for a good cause. After all, other yogurts have a pink cap month where they donate proceeds to support breast cancer research, why can't ZYN do the same thing? And that is exactly what ZYN will do once we grow our brand.</p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/745/931/e39281248b47da0c3ffb5afe31c27480_original.jpeg?v=1430966784&amp;w=700&amp;h=&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=331107bf0812bdd35b0b78c8ffb52a98"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><p></p><h1>The Process</h1><p>After the promise was made, we went hard to work. We met with food scientists at the state university; talked to fruit suppliers, yogurt producers, and vitamin suppliers. A formula was finally perfected and the brand was born. The product evolved from the single energy yogurt concept to 3 flavors of yogurt smoothies, each with its own distinct function (with more to come where YOU can pick the next flavor and/or function as a top level contributor).  A co-packer was secured, labels and websites were designed (<a href=""http://www.zynsmoothies.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.zynsmoothies.com</a>), and finally the stores are starting to agree to put ZYN smoothies on the shelves.</p><h1>
<br/>What are ZYN Smoothies?</h1><p>ZYN Smoothies are <b>ALL NATURAL</b> and were developed by health care professionals to give your body what it needs to keep it protected, energized, and focused throughout the day. Each smoothie flavor is formulated for a specific function and blended together with drinkable yogurt--which gives you the added benefits of probiotics for digestive health, 40% of the RDI of Calcium for strong and healthy bones, and 8 grams of protein to help build and repair muscle. To top it off, the milk we use for our smoothies is free of rBST hormones and our smoothies are gluten free.</p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/757/799/a7f0e8ddf719cc4e871b19dab66b548c_original.jpg?v=1431131209&amp;w=700&amp;h=&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=66e26e44d22b492ad0b366f7b3c2762c"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><p></p><ul>
<li>
<b>STRAWBERRY ENERGY: </b>Whether it’s when you just wake up in the morning or at lunchtime to get you through the rest of your day, sometimes you need a pick-me-up. The problem is energy drinks and energy shots that many people rely on for energy are unhealthy and just really don’t taste very good. ZYN Energy solves your problem with a great tasting, healthy smoothie and an energy blend of Taurine, L-Carnitine, Inositol, and Glucuronolactone; plus a healthy dose of B vitamins essential for energy metabolism.</li>
<li>
<b>PEACH FOCUS: </b>Our brains have billions of cells and they need all the help they can get so you can remain focused! ZYN Focus has the essentials that your brain needs to stay on track. A blend of B Vitamins, DHA Omega-3, Choline, Vitamin E, and Iron all combine to help your brain perform at its highest level. </li>
<li>
<b>BLUEBERRY IMMUNITY: </b>Your body is exposed to illnesses, bacteria, and viruses on a daily basis—and let’s face it...we are all way too busy to get sick. ZYN Immunity contains the essential Vitamins A, C, D, E and Zinc that are vital for your body to fight off infections and provide a boost to your body’s immune system.</li>
</ul><h1>The Next Challenge</h1><p>Yes, you guessed it...cash. Starting a business takes a considerable capital investment. Money has already been spent on the things already talked about (i.e. website, package design, product development); plus other things like lawyer fees, business insurance, and a refrigerated trailer for distribution into local channels. Extra money is now needed to help buy inventory to get us into larger retail chain stores, so that the ZYN brand can grow large enough to form successful relationships with foundations supporting finding a cure for breast cancer (e.g. The Breast Cancer Research Foundation <a href=""http://www.bcrfcure.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.bcrfcure.org</a>). The $50,000 will tremendously help us get into more stores; and, of course, if we go over our goal of $50,000 it will help us grow even faster!</p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/003/745/985/9ce1ee0fbb6ae302f822217b3eeaaa0d_original.jpeg?v=1430967380&amp;w=700&amp;h=&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=7aa24968a696ffb0479ba1bc46f9898d"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p><h1>Rewards</h1><p>I know...a lot of the rewards are apparel with ZYN logos on them.

</div><div> </div> <div> </div><h3>The Impact</h3><div> </div><p>Joshua 12 years and Jarod 10 are really the focus of this fundraiser. The goal of $50,000 is set to provide for Dagmar's final expenses but mostly to provide for her family. The family rents a small row home which is set for demolition very soon. Finding appropriate housing to keep the boys in their school district has been impossible as rentals are much higher than their current residence. The children will be facing a great loss very soon. Aware of their mothers illness, the family may actually be facing homelessness as well. Disability will never equal Dagmar's prior earnings and there are no funds for moving. Currently the boys are excelling in their studies, both on the school honor roll. Keeping them in their school would help them continue life with as much normalcy as possible. There is no safety net of funds....too many rainy days. There are no life insurance policies and it seems no new policy would pay out within the time Dagmar has. Most insurances, not for 2 years of initiating a policy. Dagmar, never known to be sickly, has been a dedicated nurse and mother, planned to work another 20 years... No one expects the first sign of a health problem to result in a terminal disease, much less with so little time left. Donations will keep Dagmar and her family from homelessness. If the goal is reached, it will be possible for the family to afford to stay locally, in their familiar home town where both her sons were born, have friends and the only change they will face is losing 'mom.' </p><div> </div><div> </div> <div> </div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><div> </div><p> I'm Dagmar and I have been on chemotherapy since June 2014.

So many side effects, I am not always the same mom my boys have been used to. They have been so supportive, helpful and especially affectionate to me through good days and bad. They are my special guys. Their stay-at-home dad  can't get past the feeling this is something he can't put his hands on and fix, so he makes sure I eat well and rest enough. Everyday since this began I stress if I'm doing enough myself....should I try a new chemo drug in clinical trials, but I may not get the new drug if I'm in a group which does not get the drug, or placebo group. I search the internet for side effects of my drugs (most of which I have), new cancer treatments and other's experiences. Even if there is an alternate treatment available, financially it may not be available to me.

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I have spent most of my life creating  and using herbal remedies - I worked in the beauty industry, owned my own spa in NYC as well as worked behind the scene on commercial and fashion shoots.</span><br/></p>
<p> In 1999, I began researching natural ingredients and  spent six years working with two Licensed chemists, developing a line of organic natural nail products that provided treatment with no carcinogenic chemicals.</p>
<p> Growing up, I never took medicine- when sick, instead my grandmother gave me  herbal remedies that were prepared at home. Presently I eat organic food as well as keeping my mind and emotions clear.</p>
<p>Throughout the years, I shared many of these natural remedies with friends and clients and I have had an amazing number of testimonials and words of gratitude of some miraculous healings. Many problems could not be resolved by the medical community, but my grandmother’s solution worked!</p>
<p>I was encouraged by friends and clients to write a book with these recipes and share it with the public as a service to help thousands have healthier choices.</p>
<p>It seems that the population of the world is becoming more aware of natural organic foods and cures and are much more interested in alternative approaches.   Our environments are being further polluted with chemicals in the air, soil, and our waters.</p>
<p>I am now compiling the material into a lavishly illustrated 144-page hardcover book.</p>
<p>""Mamanjoon's Secret Potions""  - history, legend and natural recipes from  the ancient land of Persia.</p>
<p>You can see sample images of the book in the 'gallery' page.</p>

<p>The Impact</p>
<p>When viewed in a single volume, this stunning collection of natural remedies, along with their history, legend and mythology, presents an extraordinary record of the rich variety of ancient remedies worldwide.

<h3>What is “High Saffron”?</h3>
<p>As a Person -</p>
<p>Many people who become students of a Healing and/or Spiritual practices accept a new name, being a part of the Queer Community amplified this need to be renamed and thusly have my identity rooted. My name is Saffron, you can call me Saff.</p>
<p>As a Business - </p>
<p>High Saffron as a business will provide sensitivity in Healing and Movement practices. The mission is to Travel, Research, provide Bodywork, and provide Teaching services to people from all walks of life, all body types, and all levels of ability. </p>
<ul><li>Why Travel?</li></ul>
<p>The world is vast and there is rich information regarding Moving and Healing to be gleaned from all the small corners of the world. I want to do the work of going out and accruing the information so I can bring it back to you.</p>
<ul><li>Why Research?</li></ul>
<p>Through a live blog on my pending website I will be a resource for you to access information both common and uncommon so that you may deepen your understanding of your body and of bodies in general. My mission with the blog is also to provide perspectives from bodies that may be different from you so that we can deepen our compassion for each other.</p>
<ul><li>And what about the Bodywork and Teaching?</li></ul>
<p>This will be the Life Blood of High Saffron. As I travel and research I will be offering my services to the various individuals and institutions I encounter along the way such as: yoga studios, healing centers, medical practices, retreats, and the various generous hosts I have along the way. I am a certified Personal Trainer, Pilates Teacher, and Cupping Therapist so these will be the modes I work within initially. The goal is to add Licenses, Certifications, and Alternative Modes to this list and to melt them together in real time to provide truly unique experiences.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The $Breakdown$</h3>
<p>What do I need and what do you get? - </p>
<ul>
<li>I need $1500 JUST to get started. This covers my cost for filing my LLC, Upgrading my bodywork equipment, purchasing and designing my website and blog, and embarking on my first travel adventure.</li>
<li>PERKS!!! New York Locals who donate $60 will get an hour cupping session from me in my lovely home in Brooklyn. Locals who donate $100 will get an hour cupping session in your own lovely home.</li>
<li>If my goal is not met, don’t fret. My first priority is upgrading my bodywork and body training equipment so that is where your money will go if we fall short. (But I can feel in my bones that the goal will be met.)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>It is important to understand that what you’re contributing to is the beginning. I continuously prove to my friends, family, and myself that if given the opportunity I can turn a small spark into a bonfire.</p>
<p>So today it is just me traveling, researching, and providing healing and teaching services; in the future it will be an entire institution wherein people can come to be treated and to create a deeper intimacy with themselves. </p>
<p>You’re contributing to self-love and to healing the world.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

very ambitious goals: intelligent hardware, as long as can help people live
easier, healthy enough. But often it is difficult to achieve.
Amanda is oily
skin, she's mind. Because she was getting married soon, She wants to completely
improve the problem.



Skin problems can
not be improved overnight. She needs a cycle and a complete plan.
She according
to skin test data, on the Internet to download the oily skin daily nursing
process, according to the process after two weeks for skin care, she found that
she did not understand their skin features, because she found her started to
dry eye end.
Is there a
professional intelligent products can tell me what type of skin condition, also
can be tell me what I should do? Amanda is complaining about.
We often don't
know my body, even know some data about the body, also don't know what the data
represent. What our constitution, how to improve? These are what we concern.
So,
""become"" is the core and the product, is not only a
""measure"" or ""record""
Before leaving
the house, in addition to mobile phones, how much will you bring smart products
in the body?
Record pulse,
blood pressure measuring instrument, heart rate measuring instrument, skin
moisture tester, blood oxygen tester.
You even have
a folder on your mobile phone APP for all related to physical test
Why can't a
little bit more simple, like Louis Ryan as long as a superman is enough, rather
than the avengers alliance. We want to find a have all the test function of the
product, but we couldn't find it.



It doesn't
matter, we do.
Everyone will cheer
if we do such a thing, can have at the same time with ""water and oil
testing function"", ""the heart rate and blood oxygen test
function"", ""uv test function"", ""bluetooth keyboard
shortcuts"", ""healthy life remind"" function. But if so many
hardware neat to a hardware, the hardware should be present should be the best
form of what kind of.
We create the
first generation product for ladies is completely correct, because women really
are intelligent creatures, because women have a large bag, can hold more than
the male....
 
Lisa
and Amanda have UV luminometer in their bags, Lucy has SmartBand, and
Fiona has selfie stick in her bag. But the one that they all have is
mirror.  
Yes, so we choose the mirror. It is a
tool that measures and records your body information, and
transfers information to mobile APP via data terminal, and then the
APP will help to alert and guide a healthy life.
Different from
the third party technology, Honey Mirror and Sweetips do research and
development independently
Give up the
design house numerous public hardware chip inside, we want create something with
their own inner demand design and development.
Share the
product vision, to a common belief and needs as a design guide to design new Honey
Mirror. Even for the habits of Honey Mirror chip design, in order to achieve
better software and hardware.

We
clear dysmenorrhea and the skin is dry without data. But how to solve those
problems? We get solutions on the internet or from doctors, but the problems
still exist though we have known all the advice. Why? 
Just
like your husband tells you that you should drink more hot water
to relieve dysmenorrhea at the beginning, but, you think
he doesn't do enough. You may prefer that a man gives you a cup
of water when you should drink, and says before you go to bed, “It’s time to
apply mask. Since you do more exercise today, your blood oxygen is not high,
and youlooka
little tired. If you want to look refreshed tomorrow, you can try the
red wine mask.” 
Sweety
exists like that. It doesn’t need to tell you what it is, and it is
irresponsible to just tell you what you should do. But all-the-time
care will bring the warm feeling to you.

So Honey
Mirror is everything? Of course not. There are a lot of hardware is very good.
Such as now in the market has a lot of high quality sports watches, they have
done well enough. If you wish to continue to use this sports watches and hope
to watch the movement data access to Sweetips APP, then access. This is why
we're determined to independent research and development. We open arms and
willing to accept more better Sweetips hardware connection. Our purpose is not
to deal in hardware, but really want to improve women's health and life.


Actually,
not just female, a lot of people need to take a product that is able to record
body information, analyze data, and give correct health tips. We want to make
an over all information platform that records body information for females, the
old, children, and even for all, as well as establishes personal health
database. 
We
have cooperated with main and big medical organizations, traditional
Chinese medicine hospitals, and beauty salons. Sweetips will become an
information platform including all kinds of medical organizations in future, so
users are able to choose right medical expert, beauty-specialist or even
beauty organization nearby.  
We believe
that you are beautiful because of health. Sweetips, will be your energy
platform for personal health.",34.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Chris is a salesman and often travels for business staying at different hotels.  During his travels, he brings his tablet because it is light and easy to carry.  After meeting with clients, he returns to his hotel room to finish up the day's work. With the tablet in hand, Chris propped up on the king size bed, rested his back against the headboard, and began working. He quickly became frustrated because he could not use both hands.  He grabbed a pillow and looked around the hotel room for various objects to secure the tablet in place. He tried a few things, but nothing worked.</p>
<p>When Chris returned home, he began thinking of ways to secure the tablet to a pillow. After trial and error, he successfully developed a lightweight, portable, adjustable strap in order to easily secure a tablet to any standard size pillow.  The strap is simple to use at home or in any hotel room.  This means comfort at its best.  And, as they say, ""the rest is history.""</p>

</p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">About Deysi</b><br/></p>
<p>Deysi Aleydi , 13,  was born with a cleft lip and cleft palate.
Unfortunately, these are common deformities among newborn babies born in
Guatemala. As an infant, she received her initial surgery at the Public
Hospital with a team of international medical volunteers. With the closure of
her palate, she was able to obtain nutrition and survived. However, she did not
receive the follow-up care and necessary surgeries so that she could speak
clearly. Her palate required another surgery that was not done. Her teeth are
scattered through out the roof of her mouth. And her lip requires
reconstruction surgery. Because of these deformities, she is unable to pass her
grades in school. The teachers continually fail her because they cannot
understand her. Speech therapy has not been successful. She has also been a
target of bullying and taunting among the neighborhood peers. Thanks to recent
volunteers with Nueva Generación, their evaluations indicate that Deysi possesses average intelligence and could actually do quite well in school.
However, there is little hope for her success if her speech is not improved. </p>
<p>Near Deysi’s village of San Antonio Aguas Calientes, there
is an internationally recognized surgeon in Antigua, Guatemala, Dr. Rodolfo Asensio.
He has developed unique techniques that can reconstruct the lip and palate of
these children. He has a clinic with an orthodontist and speech therapist who
work in partnership with Dr. Asensio.  Dr. Asensio's clinic, Centro Infantil de Estomatolgía, has agreed to do both surgeries for $1000. The fee covers Deysi's surgeries and two stays at the
clinic (which will be 4-6 weeks apart) and includes 4-5 day stays in the clinic
with 24 hour nursing care, anesthesia services during surgery and post
medications. Once Deysi heals from surgery, she will begin the orthodontic work
to correct her teeth alignment to promote functional speech. This will require
3-4 years of orthodontics at a cost of $40 each month plus initial visit and xrays. We are
calculating $4000 to cover all costs, exams and speech therapy. A generous donor has already contributed $750, leaving us $3250 to raise.</p>
<p>Deysi is a wonderful young teenager. She is loving, kind,
and appreciative. Deysi cries about school, because she wants to attend school
like everyone else. Because of her low grades, she was recently placed in a
“special” class that has 12 students (ages 6-18) all with a variety of physical
and mental disabilities. A preschool curriculum is being used! She is sad about
her education and does not want to be in this classroom. She is especially
close with her younger sister, Angelica and has 4 more siblings. Deysi's family
is very supportive but struggles economically. Her father has a seizure
disorder and is homebound. Her mother is an excellent weaver and is always
weaving along with cooking and caring for her family. As many of the Mayan
families, they live in a tin roof structure with dirt floors. </p>
<p>This is Deysi’s chance for a different life! Please help by
contributing to this campaign at <b>any level possible</b> and by spreading the word
by <b>sharing this link</b> through Facebook and other social media. With your
assistance, we can help Deysi find her voice and give her a smile!</p>

To make things worse. After all of that, I come home to find a ticket was sent to me in the mail by the officer on the scene. ( Patrolman K. House badge# 768 Foristell, Mo. Police department) the ticket reads;""Unlawful lane change resulting in a Motor Vehicle accident""WE NEVER CHANGED LANES!!! WE WERE RUN OFF THE ROAD!!!Life can change in the blink of an eye. Please hug your loved ones and tell them that you Love them!!Thanks to all of our friends and family who found out about this, and reached out!I hope this clears up some questions. Thanks so much again,Chris Day and Family.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Artem Sonitus customisable headphones  <br/>created by Rovinya Sollitt</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440245536/zo2iqg5jjdlxpqr0els3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
</div>
<div></div>
<p>As a key product
design member of cofabrico.co.uk, Rovinya has designed a set of headphones, which are easily customised to each user to increase comfort.</p>
<p>Rovinya spends a great deal of time listening to music through headphones. She unearthed a frustration felt by many consumers - <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">the pricing of headphones is based on the name &amp; brand instead of
the sound quality and comfort. No matter what the cost, they tend
to be fragile, limited in frequency range and fail to consider the unique shape &amp; size of each user's ears.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></p>
<div></div>
<h2>Why Indiegogo?</h2>
<div>
<p>Now we are launching the product to the Indiegogo community, to give an opportunity for early adopters to try in first-hand the concept of custom
fit headphones.</p>
<p>Why are we doing an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign? Because
we know that, the best way to find out if people really want a product is to
give them the opportunity to buy it. Crowdfunding on Indiegogo gives us the
opportunity to validate our customization process, product, concept and technology. </p>

Artem Sonitus customisable headphones  created by Rovinya Sollitt
 


As a key product
design member of cofabrico.co.uk, Rovinya has designed a set of headphones, which are easily customised to each user to increase comfort.
Rovinya spends a great deal of time listening to music through headphones. She unearthed a frustration felt by many consumers - the pricing of headphones is based on the name & brand instead of
the sound quality and comfort. No matter what the cost, they tend
to be fragile, limited in frequency range and fail to consider the unique shape & size of each user's ears.


Why Indiegogo?

Now we are launching the product to the Indiegogo community, to give an opportunity for early adopters to try in first-hand the concept of custom
fit headphones.
Why are we doing an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign? Because
we know that, the best way to find out if people really want a product is to
give them the opportunity to buy it. Crowdfunding on Indiegogo gives us the
opportunity to validate our customization process, product, concept and technology.

</div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448552606/gfdqaqmlnsmzw024uob6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>ACRT is a behavioural therapy for developing control of seizures. Through interactive online sessions, a participant will develop a specific set of skills to prevent and stop seizures. Once a participant obtain these skills, the effect can last for many years. ACRT is a non-invasive, side-effect free, effective and affordable therapy. </p>
<p>ACRT consists of 12 sessions, each session lasting about 45 minutes. To achieve the best effect, we recommend allocating three sessions a week (e.g. Monday, Wednesday and Friday) over a 4-week period.</p>
<p>During each session, you will also receive instructions and practice the technique, which you will then be able to start applying in your daily life.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448969070/u2xhwmbueutvpcecbfgh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

<h2 style=""color: #3080ce; text-align: center;"">
How does ACRT work?
</h2>
</div>
<p>The therapy embodies both physiological and psychological approaches. Our thoughts and emotions are closely linked to our bodily responses and behaviour. Events in our daily lives trigger thoughts that in turn give rise to emotions that change both our bodily stress responses and our behaviour.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446129965/snrfw6esykubhzgvgvtj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>Psychological treatments, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), argue that psychological distress is caused by distorted thoughts (or thinking habit) that trigger negative emotions and unhelpful behaviours. CBT helps you identify these distorted thoughts and correct them so that you can have more realistic and balanced way of thinking.</p>
<p>ACRT extends this CBT model by also
taking a more holistic account of the role of the body in the expression of emotional
feelings and thoughts, and by working directly on physiological aspects of well-being.</p>
<p>Published research shows that more
than 80% of people with epilepsy consider stress and anxiety to be a major factor in causing seizures. It is therefore very important to understand the mechanisms
of how the mind, brain and body interact.
Drug treatments on their own cannot give this understanding</p>
<p>Using ACRT, you will see how your body responds to your thinking and emotion. By receiving visual feedback about how your body reacts, you will be able to train yourself to become more sensitive to your bodily reactions and control your body’s state of alertness. Through this process, you will also learn how to stabilize your emotion.</p>

<h2 style=""color: #3080ce; text-align: center;"">
Who will benefit?
</h2>
</div>
<p>People with epilepsy who experience brief
auras are particularly good candidates for this type of therapy. However this is
by no means a requirement for a successful outcome. There are people without
any aura who reduce seizures by more than two thirds or more of seizures after a month of therapy.
A modified set of instructions is given in the platform for those people who do
not have an aura. People whose seizures occur predominantly with stress,
anxiety and low mood are also good candidates. Unfortunately, clinical
experience suggests that ACRT in its present form does not work as well for people who have a significant learning disability. </p>

About Dr Yoko Nagai</h2>
</div>
<p>Dr Yoko Nagai began her research in electrodermal biofeedback therapy for epilepsy in 1997. This research has since attracted scientific research funding of over £300,000 that has enabled clinical trials and a deeper understanding of the brain mechanisms by which the therapy can reduce the occurrence of epileptic seizures. Dr Nagai also founded the Biofeedback Clinic in 2005, in response to demand from patients at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London.</p>
<p>At the clinic, she treated people with epilepsy on a private basis, enabling her to continue to pursue her university research activity. There are many advantages to face-to-face therapy, but only a few people can be treated at a time, and this can be frustrating for the majority of people who wish to access the therapy in this form. Dr Nagai is now seeking to share her expertise and treatment with people globally who are in need for this effective non-drug therapy, which is termed Autonomic Cognitive Rehabituation Training (ACRT).</p>

Science
</h2>
</div>
<p>Dr Nagai's research started with investigations
into how brain and peripheral body reactions are related each other. We think that when our brain gets excited, our body does too, but it is not always the case. </p>
<p>Dr Nagai measures and observes a body
signal called electrodermal activity (EDA)/Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) which
is very sensitive to our thoughts and emotions. You may know already that EDA
is used in lie detector tests. Dr Nagai’s research has extensively
investigated how changes in EDA also modulate different brain signals.  To this end Dr Nagai has applied tools
including electroencephalography (EEG) and functional MRI (fMRI). For people
who would like to know more, the ACRT platform will have ""a science
box"" to click, where you can get all the information in lay terms. </p>

Thank you for visiting our original campaign. We have reached 38% of the initial target (£11,533). This is a really encouraging start and will enable us to continue the development of the online therapy platform. We have just launched the follow-up campaign to reach the full target. Please take a look at our new campaign and we are grateful to your support. https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/new-therapy-....


The world first digital therapy platform
for seizure control
We are raising funds to develop the therapy platform

Impact of therapy transformation by digital technology






What is ACRT?


ACRT is a behavioural therapy for developing control of seizures. Through interactive online sessions, a participant will develop a specific set of skills to prevent and stop seizures. Once a participant obtain these skills, the effect can last for many years. ACRT is a non-invasive, side-effect free, effective and affordable therapy. 
ACRT consists of 12 sessions, each session lasting about 45 minutes. To achieve the best effect, we recommend allocating three sessions a week (e.g. Monday, Wednesday and Friday) over a 4-week period.
During each session, you will also receive instructions and practice the technique, which you will then be able to start applying in your daily life.



How does ACRT work?


The therapy embodies both physiological and psychological approaches. Our thoughts and emotions are closely linked to our bodily responses and behaviour. Events in our daily lives trigger thoughts that in turn give rise to emotions that change both our bodily stress responses and our behaviour.

Psychological treatments, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), argue that psychological distress is caused by distorted thoughts (or thinking habit) that trigger negative emotions and unhelpful behaviours. CBT helps you identify these distorted thoughts and correct them so that you can have more realistic and balanced way of thinking.
ACRT extends this CBT model by also
taking a more holistic account of the role of the body in the expression of emotional
feelings and thoughts, and by working directly on physiological aspects of well-being.
Published research shows that more
than 80% of people with epilepsy consider stress and anxiety to be a major factor in causing seizures. It is therefore very important to understand the mechanisms
of how the mind, brain and body interact.
Drug treatments on their own cannot give this understanding
Using ACRT, you will see how your body responds to your thinking and emotion. By receiving visual feedback about how your body reacts, you will be able to train yourself to become more sensitive to your bodily reactions and control your body’s state of alertness. Through this process, you will also learn how to stabilize your emotion.


Who will benefit?


People with epilepsy who experience brief
auras are particularly good candidates for this type of therapy. However this is
by no means a requirement for a successful outcome. There are people without
any aura who reduce seizures by more than two thirds or more of seizures after a month of therapy.
A modified set of instructions is given in the platform for those people who do
not have an aura. People whose seizures occur predominantly with stress,
anxiety and low mood are also good candidates. Unfortunately, clinical
experience suggests that ACRT in its present form does not work as well for people who have a significant learning disability. 


Did you know?




- About one in hundred people suffer from epilepsy. 600,000 people in the UK and 50 million worldwide.

- Of these 30% are drug resistant. 180,000 people in the UK and 15 million people worldwide. 

- The cost of surgical treatment is $15,581 - $27,000 / patient (Heaney & Begley, 2002 Epilepsia). In the UK, there are about 1000 operations for epilepsy conducted every year.

- The annual cost of uncontrolled epilepsy is £3,508/ patient (Platt & Sperling, 2002 Epilepsia).

- About $ 13 billion worth of anti-epileptic drugs are prescribed every year in the world (Mackey, 2010 Nature).

Considering the above together, an effective,
non-invasive, accessible and affordable behavioural therapy for epilepsy represents a worthwhile goal that will impact significantly on the
lives of people who suffer from, or whose lives are otherwise affected by,
epilepsy.


About Dr Yoko Nagai

Dr Yoko Nagai began her research in electrodermal biofeedback therapy for epilepsy in 1997. This research has since attracted scientific research funding of over £300,000 that has enabled clinical trials and a deeper understanding of the brain mechanisms by which the therapy can reduce the occurrence of epileptic seizures. Dr Nagai also founded the Biofeedback Clinic in 2005, in response to demand from patients at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, University College London.
At the clinic, she treated people with epilepsy on a private basis, enabling her to continue to pursue her university research activity. There are many advantages to face-to-face therapy, but only a few people can be treated at a time, and this can be frustrating for the majority of people who wish to access the therapy in this form. Dr Nagai is now seeking to share her expertise and treatment with people globally who are in need for this effective non-drug therapy, which is termed Autonomic Cognitive Rehabituation Training (ACRT).


Science


Dr Nagai's research started with investigations
into how brain and peripheral body reactions are related each other. We think that when our brain gets excited, our body does too, but it is not always the case. 
Dr Nagai measures and observes a body
signal called electrodermal activity (EDA)/Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) which
is very sensitive to our thoughts and emotions. You may know already that EDA
is used in lie detector tests. Dr Nagai’s research has extensively
investigated how changes in EDA also modulate different brain signals.  To this end Dr Nagai has applied tools
including electroencephalography (EEG) and functional MRI (fMRI). For people
who would like to know more, the ACRT platform will have ""a science
box"" to click, where you can get all the information in lay terms. 


The results from the clinical trial.

(adapted from Nagai et al. Psychosomatic Medicine 2009, 71: 84-92.)
These participants all had drug resistant epilepsy,
and had been on different types of medication for many years
(for some of them, over 20years).

Once a participant learns the skill of controlling seizures through the training sessions, the effect can last for many years.



The functional activity of distinct brain regions changes


(adapted from Nagai et al. Neuroimage 2004, 22:243-251.)
The functional activity of distinct brain
regions changes over the course of the therapy. Our research shows that one
month of ACRT training increases resilience of people to anxiety-related
seizure attacks. 

Dr Nagai is currently investigating further
neural mechanisms through which ACRT helps seizure control. This
project is funded by a UK major research charitable body, the Wellcome Trust.

We very much feel that the time is right for us to disseminate Dr Nagai's expertise and make her treatment accessible for as many people as might need this new approach. 
Crowd funding was chosen as the route to make this possible as it will facilitate bringing this therapy quickly to patients, through the investment of people directly interested in the success of this approach. Crowd-funding also presents the best opportunity to increase awareness and facilitate the implementation of this non-invasive behavioural therapy for epilepsy.

I, Jami Lynne, OATX Owner/Creator, recently got a phone call from my businesses landlord, letting me know we are being unexpectedly torn down in our current space within a matter of weeks. The push out is due to a development project and demolition of my gyms location. I am looking for an immediate relocation and undertaking any/all renovations for the expansion + livelihood of this project and brand.  I am ready to take us to the next level in our new home and making it even more special than the first.

What We Need & What You Get

We are setting our goal to raise $30,000 to help cover the costs of the unexpected move and renovation of the new home.
Funding raised will contribute towards relocation costs + renovations including: Any  plumbing, electrical rewiring, painting, equipment re-installations, and branding work.

ANY donations from local supporters will be given a 2 week free pass to OATX, if you are not local and would still like to claim time in the gym from your support, please send a message along with your support!
$25 backers will receive our ""UNBOWED"" limited Tee made by Industry Print Shop in efforts to raise awareness of our story.
$125 backers will receive their first month at Outsiders ATX for free + limited tee. 
$1,500 backers will receive a year of unlimited membership and full 24/7 access to OATX + limited tee. 


The Impact

Your contribution isn't helping aid in our relocation and renovation, but you are keeping this community together and continuing to see it's growth. 
You are joining our fight to save the mental health stigma, social standards, and giving another person the chance to discover themselves and what it means to be alive. Physically, mentally, and emotionally... free.


Risks & Outcomes

Our biggest hurdle, is not finding our home in enough time and risking the entirety of the OATX community. 
Having the appropriate resources for now what is ""Phase II"" of our project, we will make the necessary renovations to the new location, get it in a functional state to continue to grow the community, and keeping the brand progression. We will have the ability to outreach even more by creating the spaces necessary to keep growth alive and developing more services to thrive.

And it wasn’t until he discovered the functional exercises workout and changed radically his way of eating (quitted dieting and learned how to eat in a healthy way) that he got rid of those negative conditions (in a few weeks he lost 60 pounds and changed notably his body shape).</p><p>Regarding other kinds of experience useful to our project, Joel also brought in an expertise panel of more than 20 years in relation to leading technology transformation processes, and developing digital products for well-known companies from several industries.</p><p>On the other hand, Franzel, as a life coach, always wanted to be able to help people change their bad habits to good habits on a massive scale. At the same time, his experience coaching people made him very aware about the importance of a persons’ self-esteem and self-confidence in order to feel good about themselves. Finally, we found that body shape results to be a key factor in this regard.</p><p>Life also has taught Franzel how motivational tools were indispensable for people to manage processes of change.</p><p>So, combining the experience and personal process of both of us, we decided to help boost people’s self-esteem, self-confidence, productivity, health and wellness through designing a unique program to help people dramatically change their body shape. But, making sure we provided indispensable support   related to healthy eating and motivation.</p><p>Honestly, we are absolutely convinced that it is not possible to achieve a transcendent body shape change without the right exercises program, ideally combined with also the right eating and the proper motivational skills. All of which are perfectly addressed by MetamorFIT. We really think that with MetamorFIT we will be able to contribute to having healthier and happier people in today’s world.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Our schedule</strong></p><p>Being our biggest challenge already reached (a fully developed App), our schedule now aims to a very feasible goal: to launch in February 2021. This, responding also to the strong boost for our product that may represent our subscribers’ intentions to start a new year with an objective as encouraging as MetamorFIT’s: to change their lives forever (Is there a better year to do so than 2021? We honestly don’t think so). In this regard, we are now focused on the training sessions video filming and post-production.</p><p>In addition, we are designing a very exciting social media influencers campaign that helps us spread our changing challenge all around the world as a miracle vaccine against any threat to our deserved wellness.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Our Budget</strong></p><p>Fortunately, a few days ago we have finally started the exercises videos production and post-production under a long term payment agreement reached with our supplier. So, to cover that in the future as well as the advertising campaign launching, we have kept our original  10k USD budget. Nevertheless, <strong>we insist that we have no limits regarding sign up admissions, so our backers can rest assured.

This way we managed to count on a very reliable and remarkable team without having to financially struggle.Most of its members were carefully selected as a result of their great performance in previous projects in which we had the chance to prove their skills and attitudes. Now, they not only share profits with us, but also dreams. Find next a better look of our team: More details about MetamorFit:We have developed a user friendly App featuring a very fitness program which is very easy to follow (no matter the subscriber’s starting state of shape). It’s also ideally complemented by a very powerful, nice to review, and easy to understand information related to healthy nutrition (no recipes, nor diets) and personal motivation.MetamorFIT is a wonderful journey during which each subscriber will be leveled on a daily basis by a complete algorithm and accompanied all along their way towards their  transformation, so they know exactly which exercises to perform every single day (no doubts,  no confusion, total clearness).  MetamorFit's origin.The idea of developing this amazing program comes from our personal experiences and wishes.On one side we have Joel’s background:He used to be overweight and suffered terrible headaches for years. And it wasn’t until he discovered the functional exercises workout and changed radically his way of eating (quitted dieting and learned how to eat in a healthy way) that he got rid of those negative conditions (in a few weeks he lost 60 pounds and changed notably his body shape).Regarding other kinds of experience useful to our project, Joel also brought in an expertise panel of more than 20 years in relation to leading technology transformation processes, and developing digital products for well-known companies from several industries.On the other hand, Franzel, as a life coach, always wanted to be able to help people change their bad habits to good habits on a massive scale. At the same time, his experience coaching people made him very aware about the importance of a persons’ self-esteem and self-confidence in order to feel good about themselves. Finally, we found that body shape results to be a key factor in this regard.Life also has taught Franzel how motivational tools were indispensable for people to manage processes of change.So, combining the experience and personal process of both of us, we decided to help boost people’s self-esteem, self-confidence, productivity, health and wellness through designing a unique program to help people dramatically change their body shape. But, making sure we provided indispensable support   related to healthy eating and motivation.Honestly, we are absolutely convinced that it is not possible to achieve a transcendent body shape change without the right exercises program, ideally combined with also the right eating and the proper motivational skills. All of which are perfectly addressed by MetamorFIT. We really think that with MetamorFIT we will be able to contribute to having healthier and happier people in today’s world. Our scheduleBeing our biggest challenge already reached (a fully developed App), our schedule now aims to a very feasible goal: to launch in February 2021. This, responding also to the strong boost for our product that may represent our subscribers’ intentions to start a new year with an objective as encouraging as MetamorFIT’s: to change their lives forever (Is there a better year to do so than 2021? We honestly don’t think so). In this regard, we are now focused on the training sessions video filming and post-production.In addition, we are designing a very exciting social media influencers campaign that helps us spread our changing challenge all around the world as a miracle vaccine against any threat to our deserved wellness. Our BudgetFortunately, a few days ago we have finally started the exercises videos production and post-production under a long term payment agreement reached with our supplier. So, to cover that in the future as well as the advertising campaign launching, we have kept our original  10k USD budget. Nevertheless, we insist that we have no limits regarding sign up admissions, so our backers can rest assured. THEY WILL GET THEIR PROGRAM IN ANY CASE. There isn't any non-delivery risk regarding videos production and post-production. And on the other hand, the advertising campaign final specifications and reach will have no impact at all on the App launching, so the App will be available for our backers within the estimated date. The importance of a product like MetamorFit nowadaysWe honestly think that the world is changing very fast; unfortunately, life seems to be getting tougher every day for most human beings and threats to our health appear to multiply on a daily basis (stress, unhealthy food and drinks, mobility restrictions, physical inactivity related to remote work from home …). Also, different mind-body diseases threaten us constantly and relying on medicines only may not be enough (it’s a proven fact that medicines don’t necessarily guarantee our healing).So, having in our hands an idea truly capable of making a difference on people’s lives by dramatically improving their chances of getting healthier, stronger, and happier, we strongly believe that this is something worth fighting for.We’ll definitely do our best to spread out our commitment to help people change all over the world as a miracle vaccine against threats to people's deserved wellness. Our commitment to other great ideas.Being aware about the importance of supporting other great ideas we have decided to redirect 1% of our backers’ contributions to other campaigns (once we have reached our goal).

For many of those years I thought free weights and reaching that one rep max was the answer. As I matured through my Martial Arts journey I realized I needed something more functional. Being level 3 in Krav Maga and a blue belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu my joints are always taken into consideration with my workouts. I heard this term ""linear variable resistance"" being used while someone was working out with bands. I did my research and now I have taken all the knowledge from using free-weights and implemented it into resistance band variations. The results are clear with increased muscle mass,flexibility,mobility and a decrease in joint pain. </p><p>With Franklin's All-Around Fitness we are taking a leap ahead of our competitors by offering our classes and programs completely online through our virtual app. Two different strength bands will be given at sign-up so members can participate immediately. With the increase in standards for social distancing we are preparing for the future so our members wont have to worry about missing a workout. They will be able to choose the gym of their choice. Whether that be their living room or the local park that day. The app provides a community tight knit family feeling with the ability to stay in constant contact with ought direct contact if need be. Members are able to sign up for scheduled classes through the app, purchase additional programs, or equipment.</p><p>Franklin's All-Around Fitness makes it possible to gain knowledge, provide workouts and stay in a communication with our members through multiple different social media avenues. Our Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, and customer app provide updated gym news, workouts, and answers to any community questions. This allows us to not only be a tight knit community but share our knowledge with others that might not be able to attend a brick and mortar location. We are hoping that with the help of everyone from Idiegogo, social media, and our local community that the growth of our Online members will sore. This will increase the renovation speed of the already 1500sq building we have. </p><p>Once our brick and mortar location is up and running we will be able to offer many more fitness classes. It will allow for up to 15 members per class at a social distancing of a little over 6 ft. Our additional classes our characterized as specialty program add-ons. Some examples of these classes are core class,  booty classes, Jiu-Jitsu, bag class,speed/agility classes, etc.  Onsite and Online members will have the ability to add these to their membership if they would like. Some may require additional equipment from the basic resistance band program if they are being done from home. The reason for this is that the bag classes will have a free standing punching bag for each member to use.</p><p>The Jiu-Jitsu members at the brick and mortar location will allow us to grow our brand even more. Our location will be considered a Gracie Garage because of my background in martial arts. It will allow Gracie students to come train at our facility for free and still advance in their curriculum.  Once we acquire 15 regular students i will have the opportunity to make our location a Certified Gracie Jiu-Jitsu Training Center. This will allow us to teach kids classes as well, broadening our clientele even further. This is the how to video for starting the Gracie garage. <u><a href=""https://www.gracieuniversity.com/Pages/Public/Application?enc=mYRxGxZaIPowUwq%2bswhvtg%3d%3d"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.gracieuniversity.com/Pages/Public/A...</a></u></p><p>I have always loved sharing my knowledge with others. Now with Franklin's All-Around Fitness I will be able to offer the community something they have never seen before.  Taking my 20+ years of fitness knowledge we are going to be able to provide the community with a workout experience that can be done from your home. Or even on a mountain top if you choose. That is what makes us so unique to the typical big name gyms. Our members are easily able to make the shift from working out from our home location to online if need be. Plus online members are already ahead of the game in case of social distancing standards. There will be no headache of figuring out how to do all those free weight and machine exercises from home.

There is always those common frustrations that discourage people from starting working out, continuing or even starting back up from years of time off. There is the people who need to be shown, those who need encouragement, some need accountability, variety, and results/continued results. When the frustration sets in from any of these feeling un-attainable or non existent that is when people quite. </p><p>Then you have the consistent workout goer who gets discouraged with un-availability of machines or classes. This is especially a concern with after the changes from covid-19. Gyms were shut down, people had no wear to workout, or even knew how to workout with what they have. I couldn't stand to see people not being able to workout and get the results I have from resistance bands.  I know that we could be a preventive of another statistic in obesity by providing our members with the knowledge we have put into these programs.</p><p>Now more than ever having our gym available anywhere anytime is vital.

There is always those common frustrations that discourage people from starting working out, continuing or even starting back up from years of time off. There is the people who need to be shown, those who need encouragement, some need accountability, variety, and results/continued results. When the frustration sets in from any of these feeling un-attainable or non existent that is when people quite. Then you have the consistent workout goer who gets discouraged with un-availability of machines or classes. This is especially a concern with after the changes from covid-19. Gyms were shut down, people had no wear to workout, or even knew how to workout with what they have. I couldn't stand to see people not being able to workout and get the results I have from resistance bands.  I know that we could be a preventive of another statistic in obesity by providing our members with the knowledge we have put into these programs.Now more than ever having our gym available anywhere anytime is vital. We are seeing more and more gyms close down because they cant meet the social distancing standards. Plus brick and mortar Gyms are are being forced to shut down. People are becoming increasingly concerned with cleanliness as well when it comes to places they are going. Here at Franklin's All-Around Fitness we will not stop working to bring workouts and develop a fitness community in these increasing difficult times.What is our missionThe traditional mindset of working out is hindering peoples goals by limiting their ability to do their workouts.No longer do you have to wait on machines, be told what to wear, when you can work out, where you can work out, or having to travel in that nasty weather to get to the gym for that nice physic. Franklin's All-Around Fitness is a community of members that can obtain their fitness goals through our programs by attending class in any environment.Done by our regularly updated social distancing procedures such as our online app, online classes, scheduling, and 6+ feet distance between members at our onsite facility.This allows our members the freedom of choosing the time of their workout and location while providing a touch-less environment to ensure the social distancing standards. Our Mission is to provide a fitness routine that our members can attend anywhere anytime and achieve their desired goals. While still allowing our members constant communication and workouts with our innovative social distancing platform.Even the smallest donation is going to make a difference.With your help we can make our dream a reality and start a new fitness trend that allows people to keep working out even if we are social distancing. You can also help by spreading the word about our business through your social media platforms. Help us get Franklin's All-Around Fitness up and running so we can show people that you don't have to go to a weight room to get fit. What is your reward for helping?

</div><p>To the attention of all good-hearted people </p>
<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>I have a great request to those who understand that
doing good is a divine thing to people that desperately need it. My son, Vlad,
is 16 years old and is deeply in need of financial help.</p>
<p>In the past 2 years (September 2013 and June 2014),
Vlad has undergone 2 extremely difficult oncological surgeries on the right
side of his neck, also known as the cervical region. The surgeries have been
done by the Institute of Oncology in Chisinau, Moldova, with the clinical
diagnosis being – aggressive fibromatosis desmoid tumour (a very rare condition
marked by the presence of desmoid tumours that can reoccur and cause organ
dysfunction). After the surgery procedures the histological results have identified
the presence of tumours which have been confirmed by 3 different laboratories
from different countries. As a result we have been to several oncological
clinics in the search of a treatment and solutions for stopping tumour
recurrence. Regretfully, despite the numerous investigations done no treatment
has been suggested.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, during the same period of the investigations
(September- December 2014) and near to the time when the surgeries were done, 2
more tumours have appeared (one of which surrounds the carotid artery and the
other just 5 cm away). To the despair of the entire family these new tumours
expand with time, causing physical pain and discomfort to Vlad.</p>
<p>In February 2015, Vlad’s medical case has been
analysed by specialists from the Oncological Clinic of Haifa, Israel- where we
have been in June 2015. Their research led to the recommendation of an
immediate surgery needed for the complete removal of the newly formed tumours,
followed by prolonged treatment. For this to happen we need to gather 29 000 $
for the surgery and 60 000 $ for the post-op treatment that will last 12
months.</p>
<p>I have to mention that this sum of money is beyond our
own forces to achieve, the whole process being very costly for our family. </p>
<p>At his age, Vlad is a great guy, full of life and
energy but at the same time he is a kid that had to mature too soon to face
destiny’s hard and cruel burden. At the peak of his teenage years he should be
enjoying life next to his family and friends but instead he is desperate and
would want nothing more than to forget about his incurable disease.  Having asked him about his future intentions
of becoming a doctor his answer was a definite NO!</p>
<p>His photo and the recommendation of the oncological
clinic are attached to this file and for further proof an offprint of his
medical history since his surgeries together with the confirmed diagnosis   and the
results of the investigation with NMR are attached.</p>
<p>Any financial support from you part will be a much
needed contribution and a step forward to the treatment of my son.</p><p><br/></p><p>

</h3><p>Certain problems in our life are very hard to get over. Snoring
is one of them. There has been a lot of effort, time, and money invested into
finding a solution for snoring; however, the results have not been very
significant or effective. </p>
<p> Our team has developed a new approach to eliminating snoring
symptoms. <b>We have earned a utility patent for our method</b>, which means that we
are taking a completely new approach and it promises to be successful. We would
like for over 90 million Americans who snore and especially for their loved
ones to get a relief and enjoy a peaceful sleep. We have developed the “SNOR”
device to take on such goal. At this moment, we are taking the last steps in
making our technology available to anybody who needs it.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436222020/vimw2qzwqghegf12rovm.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3><b>How Does it Work?</b></h3>
<p>Snoring appears due to the relaxation and the vibration of the
soft palate muscles located deep inside your mouth cavity. The weakness of the
soft palate muscles causes them to vibrate and physically produce the snoring
sound during sleep. If the soft palate muscles are strong and toned, the
vibration goes away and snoring disappears. Our “SNOR” device is an
“electronic fitness coach” which targets the soft palate muscles and makes them
stronger and tighter. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436222234/rfhz8f2tj9kaqz0kgmyc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Snoring sound is physically created by vibration of a soft
palate muscle (SPM). SPM are thin and flat muscles with one of its edges freely
hanging inside your mouth cavity. The function of this muscle is to block the
nasal passages from the inside of your mouth cavity so that food does not get
into your nose when you swallow (Image 1)</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">When the SPM are weak (Image 2), they relax during sleep and sag
more than they should. As the air from your breath passes in and out, it makes
them vibrate similar to how a flag ripples in the wind, emitting the sound,
which we know as ""snoring” (Image 3).</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>IN ORDER TO DEFEAT SNORING, YOU MUST STRENGTHEN AND TIGHTEN THE
SOFT PALATE MUSCLES</b></p>
<p>In order for any muscle to become strong, you have to train
them. That means you have to load a muscle multiple times and repeat the
procedure on daily basis. This rule is no different for your soft palate
muscles; however, the process is more complex. The first thing that you may ask
is: “How can I learn to activate and flex my soft palate muscles?” We have
designed “SNOR” so that anybody could easily train those muscles. You will be
following the directions of the device and see how your muscles are performing
on the screen of your smartphone in real time.</p>
<p><b>As easy as 1, 2, 3! </b></p>
<p>Setting up and using our “SNOR” device is very easy. Simply
follow the instructions on your smartphone screen and you will complete the

<p>Soft palate muscles engage intensively when you perform a

you need to make an effort similar to drinking liquid through a straw. The
tube needs to be positioned deep inside your mouth; otherwise, the suction will
be performed by the cheek muscles, instead of the soft palate muscles. In order
to position the tube correctly, it is marked at the point where your lips
should be placed.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436222290/cd6k605bdjpzihoewag7.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The soft palate muscles activate and you can see how well you

History</b><br/>
</h3>
<p>The idea for this device had first appeared in 2001. The first
version of the patent has been filed on that same year. Because we were
patenting the idea and not a specific device we had to prove the novelty of the
method. However, we had no experience in writing patents back then so our
patent had to be rewritten and revised several times. Finally, we have been
rewarded for our work and in 2013 the patent had been passed and published
(US Patent # 8460159). </p>
<p>Right about the same time we have started developing first
prototypes of the device. The first devices were larger and more cumbersome as
they were designed to connect to a PC. One of the major hurdles with our early
devices was the quality and reliability of the sensors. </p>
<p>At one point we have decided to miniaturize the device as the
smartphones were finally at the level where we could use them for our purposes.
The biggest problem was the compatibility with the Android devices. Since every
smartphone manufacturer has their own version of Android software and voltage
supply through the phone jack, we had to revise the original prototype several
times. We have redesigned the unit from ground-up 3 times and managed to sort out
all of the compatibility issues with Android smartphones. Below are the
previous versions of the device:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1436222589/ehzxhds4usktgebvsczs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>
</p><p> Spending a lot of our personal resources on patenting,
hardware/software development and testing we ended up coming to IndieGoGo for
help with launching the product to the mass market. </p>

<p><b>What sort of proof can you present that your “SNOR” device is effective?</b><br/></p>
<p>The link below has several studies confirming that even the indirect activation of the soft palate muscles has great, positive effect on removing the snoring symptoms:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.snoretech.com/content/6-how-does-snor-device-work#proof"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.snoretech.com/content/6-how-does-snor-device-work#proof</a><br/></p>
<p><strong><span>What does “weakened soft palate muscles” mean?</span></strong></p>
<p>Weakened means that the muscles are too soft or too thin; thus, lacking a muscular strength making them likely to sag. Those muscles dribble under the stream of air from your breath and physically produce the vocal snoring sound.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Are there any prescription drugs that can make those muscles stronger without any training?</span></strong></p>
<p>No, there are none. Even the known anabolic steroids make a muscle bigger only if you intensively train it.<br/>If you are not looking to put in a certain physical effort and your lifestyle goes against regular physical exercise, the “SNOR” device might not be for you. There are plenty of other offers on the Internet, which will not ask anything from you other than your credit card number.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I know that in order for a muscle to become larger and tighter, it needs to be loaded with a lot of weight. For example, if I train my biceps, the weight of a dumbbell corresponds with how hard my muscle is working. How will I know if the muscles of my soft palate are getting a good workout?</span></strong></p>
<p>This is exactly what “SNOR” device accomplishes. When you making a sucking effort, you activate and load your soft palate muscles and create vacuum inside the tube, which is connected to the device. The device has a built in pressure sensor, which takes a reading and sends it to your smartphone. This way you are able to see how hard your soft palate muscles are tensing. The more you tense your soft palate muscles, the more vacuum you create inside the tube. Respectively, the graph on the screen of your smartphone rises higher. In the medical field, we call this method “biofeedback”.</p>
<p><strong><span>What am I going to feel when my soft palate muscles start getting stronger?</span></strong></p>
<p>Most likely, you will not feel any different. The snoring will not start disappearing right away either. You will start seeing the result after you finalize 10-15 complete sessions with the device. The “complete” session implies that you are performing the exercise at your full ability and tensing your soft palate muscles as hard as you can. You have to put some effort into it.<strong></strong></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Is it possible that snoring comes back?</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, it is possible. After you have completed your soft palate muscles training and the snoring has disappeared, your muscles will eventually start losing its strength and tightness. Keep in mind that it is a slow process. It could take months or a year before your soft palate muscles would weaken enough to produce snoring. That being said, you can complete another course of training exercises with “SNOR” device and your soft palate muscle will restore it’s “anti-snoring” qualities.</p>

New technologies make it possible to attain certain things,
which were previously out of reach. For example, without any surgery, we now
can affect muscles deep inside your mouth, prevent them from vibrating during
sleep, and make them stop producing the snoring sound. 
 We have developed a small, intelligent training device for
your soft palate muscles, which plugs right into your smartphone. Within couple
of weeks of fun training exercises, your snoring would go away for many months
or for a year depending on how severe your condition was. 
Try it out! The ""SNOR"" DeviceHere is the actual photo of the device in it's current form. At this point we are waiting on packaging materials for he first small batch of our product. Our Goal

Certain problems in our life are very hard to get over. Snoring
is one of them. There has been a lot of effort, time, and money invested into
finding a solution for snoring; however, the results have not been very
significant or effective. 
 Our team has developed a new approach to eliminating snoring
symptoms. We have earned a utility patent for our method, which means that we
are taking a completely new approach and it promises to be successful. We would
like for over 90 million Americans who snore and especially for their loved
ones to get a relief and enjoy a peaceful sleep. We have developed the “SNOR”
device to take on such goal. At this moment, we are taking the last steps in
making our technology available to anybody who needs it.How Does it Work?
Snoring appears due to the relaxation and the vibration of the
soft palate muscles located deep inside your mouth cavity. The weakness of the
soft palate muscles causes them to vibrate and physically produce the snoring
sound during sleep. If the soft palate muscles are strong and toned, the
vibration goes away and snoring disappears. Our “SNOR” device is an
“electronic fitness coach” which targets the soft palate muscles and makes them
stronger and tighter. 

Snoring sound is physically created by vibration of a soft
palate muscle (SPM). SPM are thin and flat muscles with one of its edges freely
hanging inside your mouth cavity. The function of this muscle is to block the
nasal passages from the inside of your mouth cavity so that food does not get
into your nose when you swallow (Image 1)


When the SPM are weak (Image 2), they relax during sleep and sag
more than they should. As the air from your breath passes in and out, it makes
them vibrate similar to how a flag ripples in the wind, emitting the sound,
which we know as ""snoring” (Image 3).


IN ORDER TO DEFEAT SNORING, YOU MUST STRENGTHEN AND TIGHTEN THE
SOFT PALATE MUSCLES
In order for any muscle to become strong, you have to train
them. That means you have to load a muscle multiple times and repeat the
procedure on daily basis. This rule is no different for your soft palate
muscles; however, the process is more complex. The first thing that you may ask
is: “How can I learn to activate and flex my soft palate muscles?” We have
designed “SNOR” so that anybody could easily train those muscles. You will be
following the directions of the device and see how your muscles are performing
on the screen of your smartphone in real time.
As easy as 1, 2, 3! 
Setting up and using our “SNOR” device is very easy. Simply
follow the instructions on your smartphone screen and you will complete the
session in 10 minutes.

Install the “SNOR” app into your smartphone and plug the device
in.


Connect the headphones to the “SNOR” device and insert the tube
into the opening on the device. 


Launch the app and start the training procedure!


Soft palate muscles engage intensively when you perform a
sucking effort through a tube. There is a tube that attaches to our “SNOR”
device. The tube has to be positioned inside your mouth in a specific way and
you need to make an effort similar to drinking liquid through a straw. The
tube needs to be positioned deep inside your mouth; otherwise, the suction will
be performed by the cheek muscles, instead of the soft palate muscles. In order
to position the tube correctly, it is marked at the point where your lips
should be placed.The soft palate muscles activate and you can see how well you
are tensing them on the screen of your smartphone.
""SNOR"" sets a individualized training program and
displays how your muscles are performing in a form of a graph on your
smartphone screen. The graph serves as a reference as to how you are performing
the exercise in real time. This method is called ""biofeedback"". Apart from demonstrating the graph of your soft palate
muscles activity, ""SNOR"" uses a number of multimedia stimuli (movies,
videos, images) in order to reward you for your good effort. Such process makes
using our device simple and pleasurable. ""SNOR"" also saves all of your progress and you
can review it at any time.

Within 2-weeks time you or your partner will notice that you are
snoring a lot less. In time the snoring will completely disappear. The standard
length of the course is 20 sessions. Each session takes 10 minutes. Timeline
Development
History

The idea for this device had first appeared in 2001. The first
version of the patent has been filed on that same year. Because we were
patenting the idea and not a specific device we had to prove the novelty of the
method. However, we had no experience in writing patents back then so our
patent had to be rewritten and revised several times. Finally, we have been
rewarded for our work and in 2013 the patent had been passed and published
(US Patent # 8460159). 
Right about the same time we have started developing first
prototypes of the device. The first devices were larger and more cumbersome as
they were designed to connect to a PC. One of the major hurdles with our early
devices was the quality and reliability of the sensors. 
At one point we have decided to miniaturize the device as the
smartphones were finally at the level where we could use them for our purposes.
The biggest problem was the compatibility with the Android devices. Since every
smartphone manufacturer has their own version of Android software and voltage
supply through the phone jack, we had to revise the original prototype several
times. We have redesigned the unit from ground-up 3 times and managed to sort out
all of the compatibility issues with Android smartphones. Below are the
previous versions of the device:

 Spending a lot of our personal resources on patenting,
hardware/software development and testing we ended up coming to IndieGoGo for
help with launching the product to the mass market. 
That being said, this is more than a money-making business for
us. This is the opportunity to bring something positive into this world and to
improve the quality of life for a lot of people.
Risks and Challenges
With your help, we can start the mass production of the “SNOR” device and set up the distribution infrastructure. Without your contribution, we would grow too slowly and there is a possibility we may delay this project indefinitely due to the lack of capital.
All the electronic components, the circuit boards have been fully tested. We have gone through several prototypes to iron out the compatibility problems with various smartphones and reached the final, fully functional design.
We are working with a reputable, US based manufacturer. We need your support to pay for the first batch of “SNOR” devices, for the packaging, advertising, and to continue paying the programmers working on our web site.
We work hard so you, our backers, can be the first to use our great product at lowest cost. Our goal is to start shipping first “SNOR” devices at the end of August 2015.

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
<p>A 7.8 magnitude earthquake struck Nepal on April 25<sup>th</sup>.  Entire villages were buried. 1,000’s died as large parts of the capital Kathmandu collapsed.  In the countryside, the death toll is unknown and unimaginable. International aid and relief  teams have descended on Nepal to help rebuild shattered lives. Yet<b>  </b>funding has reduced to a ""trickle"".  Right after the earthquake hit, causing 8,000 deaths and leaving 8.1 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, there was an outpouring of emergency funding.  But The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) says it has received only $92 million of the $423 million requested via a flash appeal on May 11. By contrast, The International Organization for Migration (IOM) pointed out that $735 Million had been committed within a month of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. When a typhoon hit the Philippines in 2013, $275 million was committed within the same time period.  Without funding, IOM's contractors would have to stop clearing rubble and medical assistance to those in need would cease.  Supplies to build temporary shelters would be severely curtailed, leaving tens of thousands of families with only tarps and plastic sheets to protect them.  Those living in remote areas are likely to face increasing shortages of supplies such as rice, tarpaulins and medicine. In addition, education has been severely curtailed.  Over 24,000 classrooms have been damaged or destroyed by the earthquake and there is a desperate need to set up alternative learning spaces for children. Medical attention is imperative at this time. Resources are scarce as many are trying to rebuild hospitals and provide safer environments to receive medical care. Doctors, Nurses and Medical Staff are working around the clock trying to treat many that have fallen ill, if not terminally ill. </p>

Projects Abroad has worked in Nepal since 1999 and has long standing relationships  with many organizations in Chitwan, Kathmandu, The Kathmandu Valley and Ghandruk, especially with schools, children’s homes and hospitals.  On June 2015, Projects Abroad began giving volunteers the opportunity to help with vital relief efforts on their Disaster Relief Project.  This relief effort will last as long as needed.  </p>
<p>The immediate objectives of the Disaster Relief projects are firstly to help some of the tens of thousands of children whose schools have been damaged return to school.  Over 24,000 classrooms have been damaged or destroyed by the earthquake and there is a desperate need to set up alternative learning spaces.Volunteers will also be helping to teach and care for the children in these temporary schools as well as re-building and renovating schools to help make them safe places to return to.  The Relief project is initially focusing on rural and semi-rural areas in the Kathmandu Valley. </p>
<p>Hospitals are in dire need of attention as all hands are on deck rebuilding. Medical stations have been in place in many areas where thousands of families have remained homeless.

The Project will expand into other regions as work is completed and participation grows. The only way to do that is to provide funding and lend a hand.


A Bit About Me
I am a 26 year old EMT in Boston, Massachusetts. I have 7 years of experience in Wilderness Emergency Medicine, with certifications in Search and Rescue and Wilderness Advanced Life Support. I am working towards a career in International Emergency Medicine by applying to a Nurse Practitioner graduate school program. International work in this field will help me build a better relationship with people in need under dire circumstances. It will also give me experience to draw me closer to a more communal aspect in this line of work. It is important for me to travel abroad to learn about and expand medical organizations for countries in need. 




 The Impact 



Since Projects Abroad does not receive any government funding, they have to charge a price for their projects.  As a volunteer, therefore, I will have to pay a placement fee which covers all standard costs such as my food and accommodation, health and travel insurance, airports transfers, as well as all project materials. 

This fee will not only support me, but will help support Projects Abroad.The money goes directly into support for volunteers, implementing and monitoring of projects, awareness, communication and advice, direct costs on the ground and operating and administrative costs. 
By supporting me, you are helping me get the direct hands-on experience I need to help define my goal of a career in International Emergency Medicine and will help with graduate schools admissions. It will also allow me to see the physical and emotional challenges of medical relief work up close. 
I will be starting in Kathmandu where I will be involved in working along side of doctors and nurses providing immediate emergency and long term care to the sick and injured. I will be working with children and adults alike in intensive care units and labor units. When I am not working in the hospitals, I will be working along side of many to help rebuild schools and homes to provide safe places for displaced families. 



Funding



I am asking you all for $3500.00. It seems like a lot but with the power of social media I believe we can reach this goal together. $1500 goes towards my flight. The rest of the money will be paid in full to Projects Abroad as the organization not only supports me, but helps the entire staff I am working with. With that being said, I would love to go past this goal and provide extra funding for this organization. 
ANYTHING HELPS!! Whether it is a $10 contribution or a $200 contribution, it all helps fight for many in need.

Risks & Challenges

 
The risks and challenges that we will be facing are hardships that the people face every day. Roads are closed as landslides cripplethe region blocking support routes to villages. Far too many citizens are falling ill due to contaminated water supply and shortages of food, supplies and housing. Thousands are desperate and enter into the hospital each day and it us up to the doctors and volunteers to treat these patients. 

    Other Ways You Can Help 
It is ok if you can not contribute financially at this time! All that I ask is that you share this campaign. Help me make some noise about this issue. The news is no longer covering the suffering in Nepal, so this is the most important time to raise awareness. Please help put this country back on forefront and help get this country the funding and support it deserves. 

From the bottom of my heart, thank you. In any way you can and will support, thank you.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

BlackFiles – Your unique personal data management software.

The BlackFiles Team: software developers, graphic designers, marketing experts and private computer users are working since two years in optimizing a solution for an effective data management software easily to handle with. We performed many interviews with interested users, presenting them our software concept and also several drafts of the user interface. Finally we found the optimal solution. 

BlackFiles – Uniformity, simplicity and security for your data.







BlackFiles is a collection of single applications, called modules, with a common user interface. Each module is treating another class of data. Similar themes are joined in containers, called module packages. We will start with 3 module packages:
BlackFiles/Basics – handling Documents, Passwords and ContactsBlackFiles/Pics – handling Pictures, Videos and TV RecordsBlackFiles/Tunes – handling Music Files, Internet Broadcast Stations and Events 



 Examples of the modules Documents, Pictures and Music.


The first three module packages mentioned will be separately offered to the private consumers worldwide for a very affordable price.More module packages like BlackFiles/Financings, BlackFiles/Communications, BlackFiles/ePrints, BlackFiles/Social Media etwa will follow.The software will run on Windows©, MacOS©, Android© and iOS© and will be available in Spring 2016 in English, Spanish, German and French.
This are only a few of the BlackFiles' advantages for the user:➜ Same user interface in all modules.➜ Preinstalled category folders and forms.➜ Multilingual menu.➜ Meaningful expansion of the software to the user's needs.➜ Easy synchronization of data with mobile devices.➜ Centralized data management.➜ Encryption of private data.➜ Automatic reminders.➜ Support without restrictions, costs and time limitation.➜ Very affordable price.





The problem: Until now computer users need several applications to manage their digital data. They all have different user interfaces, requiring a lot of time to get familiar with. They are all expensive and need to be constantly updated. 


 Many applications, many interfaces, many expenses – many drawbacks.

The solution: Imagine a software able to organize any kind of personal data having always the same user interface. The recorded data are password protected and can be stored in private archives. Preinstalled folders and forms enable you to organize the files in an easy way. And of course, the data can be synchronized with mobile devices. This and much more is BlackFiles.

The software target group are the 1,5 billion users worldwide using their computers primarily for private purposes. Market analyzes, conducted at the beginning of the project, showed an exceptionally strong willingness to buy BlackFiles.
In the medium term BlackFiles should establish itself worldwide as the standard software for the complete private data management – similar to the position of Microsoft Office© for office applications.


The BlackFiles Team believes in this project and will do the very best to achieve this goal.



We analyzed of course the market of data management software and we didn't find any kind of software with such a smart approach like BlackFiles. So BlackFiles will be the first to enter this market of integrated applications.

I was diagnosed in 2001 with a degenerative neuromuscular disorder, like a mild form of Lou Gehrig's Disease (ALS). The condition is progressing very slowly, but it has impacted my life in a number of ways. It robs me of energy, and makes it difficult for me to walk. It's also rendered me pretty much unable to work, although I'm attempting to pursue music, photography, and game development careers.<br/><br/>As a result, I'm stuck in my home most of the time, and mostly sedentary. I'm caught in a vicious circle--not being able to exercise means I'm overweight, so it takes more energy to move around and I experience pain in various places, which makes it more difficult to exercise or move around, and the problem builds on itself. I don't have many options for exercising; free options like going for a walk are out of reach for me because of my disability; I need cardio exercises I can do sitting down. And going to a gym is expensive and tires me out before I even start exercising, plus the local gym is not fully accessible.<br/><br/>I have some space that I would like to turn into a fitness area, but I need some help equipping it. I'm currently looking at 3 pieces of equipment, although I'm not 100% settled on all of them--it depends partly on available funds.<br/><br/>Concept2 Model D or E rower with PM5 computer <a href=""http://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00NH9WEUA/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&amp;colid=JHIXDGLBHZ4&amp;coliid=I5VVNMMUUCPKA&amp;psc=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00NH9WEUA/ref=wl_it_dp...</a><br/>This is my top priority, as it gives the best all-round workout. However, it's also the most expensive, and takes up the most space, so I'm not likely to get it first.

I was diagnosed in 2001 with a degenerative neuromuscular disorder, like a mild form of Lou Gehrig's Disease (ALS). The condition is progressing very slowly, but it has impacted my life in a number of ways. It robs me of energy, and makes it difficult for me to walk. It's also rendered me pretty much unable to work, although I'm attempting to pursue music, photography, and game development careers.As a result, I'm stuck in my home most of the time, and mostly sedentary. I'm caught in a vicious circle--not being able to exercise means I'm overweight, so it takes more energy to move around and I experience pain in various places, which makes it more difficult to exercise or move around, and the problem builds on itself. I don't have many options for exercising; free options like going for a walk are out of reach for me because of my disability; I need cardio exercises I can do sitting down. And going to a gym is expensive and tires me out before I even start exercising, plus the local gym is not fully accessible.I have some space that I would like to turn into a fitness area, but I need some help equipping it. I'm currently looking at 3 pieces of equipment, although I'm not 100% settled on all of them--it depends partly on available funds.Concept2 Model D or E rower with PM5 computer http://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00NH9WEUA/ref=wl_it_dp...This is my top priority, as it gives the best all-round workout. However, it's also the most expensive, and takes up the most space, so I'm not likely to get it first. The Model E is preferable, since it's higher, and so easier for me to get on and off, but the Model D is more available. I've wanted to get one of these for a while, but didn't have the space for it. Now I've moved and I've got the space (although I need to clear some stuff out first), but my living expenses have increased so I can't really afford it.Schwinn 270 Recumbent http://www.amazon.ca/dp/B00D4LEEXQ/ref=wl_it_dp...This is my second priority, but probably my first purchase.

<p>Hello. I am Bolor-Erdene.</p>
<p>I am citizen of the mostly air-polluted city in the world, Ulaanbaatar.</p>
<p>In 2015 winter, an incredible event happened to me. I found out that I was pregnant.</p>
<p>I have been living in the most dangerously air polluted area of the city. In 2016 spring, my doctor told me that my baby’s mental development has problem and brain development growth was slower than the normal. The news was indeed shocking and frightening which made me to start asking doctors the reasons for my baby's health problem. Number of women giving birth with lot of health problems with their babies. This number is increasing year by year.</p>
<p>The doctor said the main cause for my baby’s mental and brain development was the air pollution that comes from the unprocessed coal smoke. When I said to the doctor that I had been using cotton mask while I was pregnant, he replied to me that cotton mask is not the way to get over the air pollution.</p>
<p>I really regret that I should have protected myself from the air pollution using the right mask which would have prevented from me giving birth without any problems.</p>
<p>In pharmacies, they mostly sell cotton masks. The usage rate of the right mask against the air pollution is very low, introducing to the public and how to use the right mask was done by no body.</p>
<p>Winter is approaching and the time for heavy air pollution is ahead. It worries me that here are numbers of mothers who have same problems as me and I have been continuously thinking of how to help these mothers. It came to my mind strongly that the first step is to create an awareness of this severe issue and inform them about ways to protect themselves and their babies from air pollution. That is, the solution lies on how mothers could simply make the right choice with right information in-hand at the beginning.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I am currently conducting a project that seeks to deliver 2,000 specially-equipped masks to pregnant mothers. The project aims to inform and educate mothers of the advantages of using the right mask and the severity of air pollution.</p>

I developed this roller to effectively, efficiently and independently target the trapezius muscles (I call it the <strong>Trapz Rollerz</strong>) as I found no other device to effectively target this area. Most massage rollers are made of foam and use your body weight to maneuver on the roller to get relief.  This can be ineffective and awkward for the trapezius and forearms.  With <strong>Heavy Metal Rollerz</strong>, the weight of the roller does the work, especially the muscles of the trapezius (<strong>Trapz Rollerz</strong>), forearms (<strong>Forearmz Rollerz</strong>) and quadriceps (<strong>Quadz Rollerz</strong>).</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469759862/na7f4bvqeqhhlgw4ivc0.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>I have over the years suffered from many aches and pains specifically in my trapezius which causes headaches for me.  I go to the massage therapist monthly to get a massage as prevention, which is wonderful, however in between visits it was difficult to take care of this area and the visits can get expensive and be time consuming.  (She does this thing with my trapezius where she pushes her thumbs into my muscles-it's awesome- and I wanted to be able to mimic this).  At the gym that I attend, I was first introduced to using a 30-45 pound barbell to massage the quadriceps and trapezius independently, and the hamstring and calves with a partner and introduced to the concept of ""<i>Myofascial Release</i>"".  With using the barbell however, it was difficult to maneuver and not everyone has a barbell and partner at home.  Lacrosse balls can also be used however you must put yourself in some precarious positions.   I then thought to myself, ""Doesn't anyone simply sell the end of the barbell?"" (that's all you need).  I then researched the market and the answer was 'No', so I sought out to develop it and <strong>Heavy Metal Rollerz </strong>was born.  </p><p>I have always been athletic and involved in sports in some aspect starting with gymnastics at the age of 6 and now participating in Crossfit at the age of 48 for the past 3 years and I love it!  I  love being active and my goal is to stay fit and healthy as long as possible, enjoy life, and keep up with my active 4 children, who are now adults.  I want my children to enjoy life and not have to worry about taking care of me. </p><p>My expertise includes a lifetime of sports and physical activity  including gymnastics (my true love) swimming and diving, cheerleading, dance, basketball, track and field, softball, and many other adult fitness activities such as traditional aerobics and strength training.  I also hold a Bachelors degree in Health and Physical Education, Associates Degree in Business Administration, and Masters degrees Counseling Psychology and Secondary School Counseling along with numerous Fitness certifications through American Aerobic Association International (AAAI) and Athletics and Fitness Association of America (AFAA).  </p><h3><strong>What We Need From You!</strong></h3><p>Contributing to <strong>Heavy Metal Rollerz</strong> will help me achieve assisting with increasing overall wellness of fitness enthusiasts while decreasing overall muscle tension and improving muscle performance.  It will assist with my first line of production costs, advertising and patent application.  I chose a stainless steel product as it is the best quality steel with the least side effects.  Carbon steel will rust and chemical coatings eventually come off (although I was told it would not).  Many people have skin allergies which I want to keep the product chemical free and user friendly.  I also chose to proudly make <strong>Heavy Metal Rollerz</strong> in the <strong>USA</strong> keeping <strong>USA</strong> jobs alive!  I currently have been granted a United States Provisional Utility Patent which is due to expire soon and I need to file a non-provisional patent. I would like to also file for a design patent at the suggestion of my attorney.  I also plan to donate a portion of sales to a non-profit organization that I will create to assist with underprivileged children in our community to join community activities and sports.  I feel that community involvement is an integral part of a childhood to get involved and stay healthy, both physically and mentally.  I have been working with underprivileged children with Mental Health diagnoses, especially Autism, for the past 15 years.  My goal is to have people share my results and relief with using <strong>Heavy Metal Rollerz</strong>.  My muscles feel better, I perform better, my muscles are more flexible, and my headaches are minimal.  </p><p><strong>So Where Does Your Contribution Go Exactly?</strong></p><p>Costs for <strong>Heavy Metal Rollerz</strong> include $24,000 for the first round of manufacturing for the 15 pound roller, '<strong>Trapz Rollerz</strong>' which the more that is made, the cheaper the cost to the buyer (The <strong>Trapz Rollerz</strong> design is finalized and the manufacturer is secured and awaiting my call); $4,750 for a mold for the bumpy roller '<strong>Quadz Rollerz</strong>' which can make 10, 15 and 20 pound rollers (The pattern shop is secured, however we are finalizing the design); $1,000 for carry bags; $10,000 to file for a non-provisional United States utility patent;  $3,000 to file for a design patent; $12,000 for advertising; $5,000 for upcoming trade and fitness expositions.  I am currently operating out of my house and intend to keep it there as long as possible to keep costs low to the buyer.  I am looking to make each of the rollers '<strong>Trapz Rollerz</strong>, <strong>Forearmz Rollerz,</strong> and<strong> Quadz Rollerz</strong>' in 10, 15 and 20 pound weights. </p><p><strong>What You Get</strong></p><p>I would like to offer perks for people to experience<strong> Heavy Metal Rollerz </strong>first.  This includes a reduced cost to the contributor getting one 15 pound <strong>Heavy Metal Rollerz</strong>  ""<strong>Trapz Rollerz</strong>"".  </p><p>If funds aren't totally raised, the funds raised will be used to the first round of manufacturing first, then to advertising and expositions, and lastly patent.  </p><h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3><p>I feel that my project will be an asset form any fitness enthusiast to professional athlete. <strong> Heavy Metal Rollerz</strong> provides athletes with an effective alternative to typical massage rollers that can be used inexpensively and independently and gives great relief to its users.  With my contributing a portion of the proceeds to underprivileged children, this can give the children and families something to look forward to that they enjoy.  I love to see children's smiling faces when they are having fun.  It will give them a place to go where they can be happy and have fun.  Many of these children and families have day to day struggles which are out of their control.  I also made it a point to keep<strong> Heavy Metal Rollerz </strong>production in the <strong>United States</strong> to assist with maintaining <strong>USA </strong>employment.  Although it may be minimal, it does make a difference. </p><p> <strong>And here's a little bit more about me</strong>.  </p><p>Over the years, I have always enjoyed working with people and giving them assistance in many different ways.  I feel happy simply to help someone out.  Also, when I put my mind to something, I will do it.  I am very frivolous when it comes to spending money.  I saved money by doing mostly everything myself or seeking help from people that I know.  I am now a photographer, videographer, and video editor, and am improving with my skills daily!  Also to save money, I talked to different attorneys getting opinions at minimal costs, using a retired attorney, a <i>Wilkes University Allan P. Kirby Center for Free Enterprise and Entrepreneurship </i>attorney, local SCORE chapter attorney and consulted with other attorneys for FREE.  I am also very time conscious.  I don’t like to waste it!  I work efficiently and effectively to get the most out of the day.</p><p>When I was younger, around age 6, my oldest sister introduced me to gymnastics.  She saw a talent in me and helped me improve it.  Gymnastics was my sanity as a child as my childhood was a bit difficult and stressful to say the least.  I could certainly say that Gymnastics 'saved me'.  Athletics have always been a part of my life and I simply love participating in them.  I love the way I feel when I am doing any physical activity, I strengthen my muscles, heart and lungs, and it is a great coping skill and stress reducer.  There are so many healthful benefits of exercise.  Over the years, I have had aches and pains which at times prohibited me with participating in once enjoyable physical activities.  When I was introduced to massage rolling and really taking care of my muscles at the age of 45, I have never felt better.  I want to share my success and let others get the benefits of a healthy body from using <strong>Heavy Metal Rollerz</strong>. </p><p>                                                <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469759980/wlbyq47bbotvnqlbcafe.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>Coming from a hard working family, I was taught that hard work and persistence with pay off in the end.  Both of my parents grew up in poor families.  My mother at age 16 worked in a shirt factory until her retirement and my father was a member of the United States Army, worked in the coal mines and then a steel factory until his retirement.  They showed me how to work hard to get what you want and that hard work was a priority.  They worked very hard to support their family and give us what they didn’t have and to live an easier life than they had in their childhood.  They taught me how to work to make a living and how to make a difference by being kind and helpful to others.   Although my parents were educated to some of High School (later a GED in her retirement-Go Mom!) and a High School graduate (Go Dad!), they encouraged me to further my education which gave me a drive for learning (and I DID NOT want to work in a factory-I saw their pains and struggles with this).  I consistently am looking to learn something that I do not know.  If I need to know something or don't know something, I seek to find it until I do.   I am the type of person that will persist to find a solution to a problem.   I am always open to learn new skills and information.  I enjoy learning and helping others.  I dedicate <strong>Heavy Metal Rollerz </strong>to my parents with having a <strong>'Z'</strong> which is the first letter in their last name. </p><p>                        <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469760437/kh9nkxfyocb6eodauekm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>                       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469760522/egdtf27mcbyncvokiu3l.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Some challenges that I may face is <strong>Heavy Metal Rollerz</strong> will be a unique new product line.  There may be some difficulty with introducing it and getting the name out there.  However, there are currently many new muscle manipulation modalities being introduced often and based on those modalities ""Myofascial Release"", this product should be a hit!  Currently the only obstacle for me with starting the sell this product is time and money.  I work full time currently and it proves difficult to get things done efficiently.

Somewhere during this time, we were introduced to putting a 30-45 pound barbell on our trapezius.  Well that felt pretty good, but very awkward.  A spark goes off and I simply thought to use the weighted end of the barbell.  January 2015-Totally by chance at the right place and the right time, I am talking to a Computer Aided Design Teacher at a local school about what I am trying to find and make.  He is able to show me and tell me about making plastic prototypes and where I can get one done!  I now simply needed a solid metal 1 foot bar.  I then contacted the companies who make barbells to see if such a thing exists.  It didn't!  ""Now where do I find such a thing?""  Not so simple.   Well I started with a recycling center and looked around the scrap yard and found a few steel bars but not what I was looking for.  They gave me a contact as a starting point and I began calling any place that may sell something like it and finally found a supplier of steel bars!  Success!  March 2015-After researching local technical schools in the area, I found one that could make me a plastic prototype for FREE!  I then contacted every machine shop in the area (pretty much!) and found one that could machine my steel bar into the plastic design.  My goal however was to get the price much cheaper!  August 2015- Again, by chance, I hear an advertisement for Inventions Home with regard to patenting an idea.  (Interestingly, I don't hear that commercial now), So I had a patent search completed and filed and was granted a United States Provisional Patent for one year. October 2015- Again by chance, I hear of our local SCORE chapter for new businesses began holding information sessions about opening a new business.  I attended these sessions over the next few months being introduced to Wilkes University's business assistance program.   March 2016 - Over the year, I called and visited and researched other machine shops, along with steel foundries to do another design, and finally found a reasonable machine shop who does excellent quality work to manufacture the roller.  Whew, that was really tough!  I also had several other prototypes made in plastic and steel during this time.  I also contacted powder and other coating companies to try this as a cheaper option.  Cheaper isn't always better.  No coating that I tried actually stayed on.  I had a few different prototypes made at a local machine shop and brought them to the gym for testing...Success.  Everyone who tried it gave positive feedback.  April 2016-I was asked by Wilkes University to take part in their Entrepreneur Showcase as I began working with them through our local SCORE chapter.   All positive feedback was given!August 2016-Indiegogo campaign launchOctober 2106-Heavy Metal Rollerz will be ready for production and sales.  Thank you for your interest in Heavy Metal Rollerz.

<p>Swedish scientists Tobias Olofsson
and Alejandra Vásquez (both PhDs in Engineering at Lund University, Sweden)
discovered in 2005 a great number of, previously unknown beneficial bacteria,
which live and developed together with honeybees in an organ called the honey
crop (used in gathering nectar). </p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431940905/haz1zubib57eeqfwmf8b.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Honey is a viscous and sweet fluid
produced by honeybees from the nectar of flowers to store it during winter.
Honey is as old as written history, dating back to 2100 B.C. where it was
mentioned in Sumerian and Babylonian cuneiform writings, the Hittite code, and
the sacred writings of India and Egypt. It is a worldwide known “folk medicine”
with many unidentified components.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431939394/lkudf4hrjtkufu2r4rzo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Alejandra and Tobias’ on-going
research shows that most of the “unidentified compounds” and already found
compounds in honey originate from these discovered bacteria that live inside
honeybees. These good bacteria are called lactic acid bacteria and represent
one of the major bacterial groups applied in the food and Biotech industries.
They found 13 different species, nine lactobacilli and 4 bifidobacteria, which
are present in all honeybees around the world and added to fresh honey at great
quantities. In other words, these massive beneficial bacteria are found within
all honeybees and active in freshly harvested honey found in all continents in
the world. This scientifically explains, why freshly harvest honey has been and
is still used as a folk medicine. </p>
<p>Alejandra and Tobias’ studies show
that these lactic acid bacteria possess unique antimicrobial properties, which
in turn are the key to use them as a potential alternative to antibiotics.</p><p><b>The problem</b></p>
<p>The increasing antibiotic resistance
is a major worldwide concern and many efforts are on-going in order to find
alternative tools to fight infections. People are looking at natural
environments, but still many search for novel chemical compounds to be used as
future drugs.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431939499/gj8s4syyhntlgiskku43.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Alexander Fleming discovered
penicillin in 1928. Penicillin is a type of antibiotics that molds of the genus
named <i>Penicillium</i> produce to kill
competing microorganisms such as bacteria, a weapon that is. Penicillin does
not work against all bacteria but only on certain ones. However, there are
other microbes as the bacteria called streptomycetes that produce other kind of
antibiotics, which work against bacteria other than penicillin. To sum, some
bacteria or fungi form a sort of substance that they use as weapons against
competing microbes. Man grows up these small living antibiotic factories,
extracting the substance and make pills for sick people who are suffering from
infections. Then as it is only one single substance in high concentrations pathogens
soon begin to acquire defense against it. This is like, pathogens get bombarded
by one single weapon (for instance arrows) and the pathogens build shields
against all the arrows as the pathogens get used to man's widespread fight with
these weapons (in the form of pills). Then people start pouring in more kinds
of antibiotics into pills, much like shooting arrows and cannon balls at the
same time; then pathogens build thicker walls and form in this way resistance.
Today, a drug company can develop a new antibiotic and after a period of about
10 years, pathogens learn how to protect themselves again, once again becoming
resistant to the developed drug.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Our solution</b></p>
<p>The greatness of using the
discovered 13 collaborating lactic acid bacteria is that they do not produce
only one weapon (one substance such as antibiotics), but together hundreds of
different weapons (substances). And if the lactic acid bacteria are used viable
(which we always do) then they can choose how much of what weapons are needed
and produce them depending on the closest-threatening pathogen. Like a clever
strategy!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431939543/otlugeai9r1pcmde51jb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our way of thinking is very
controversial. We want to use viable good bacteria in high amounts as small
weapon factories, which produce only what is needed, without creating
resistance. </p>
<p>This idea is not compatible with
today's big international efforts to find new antibiotics. Nor is it accepted
that we as researchers and entrepreneurs go completely against already
developed structures. We were young when we made the discovery and to this day
we have no established structures behind our ideas, such as a well-known
university professor or a pharmaceutical company.</p>
<p>The concept is revolutionary and the
lactic acid bacteria are simply too good to dump them at a high price. While,
we would instead focus on making a contribution to society and produce natural,
simple and sustainable alternatives to antibiotics that will help people
worldwide. They will do good to all who need them, but we cannot do this
ourselves without financial support, we need help to realize our dream and we
want to share this road with you!</p><p><b>Why hasn’t this been discovered before?</b></p>
<p>The beneficial bacteria are only
viable outside the bees during a few weeks as in honey harvested from wild bee
colonies by honey hunters. They are not present in any mature honey or honey
derived products harvested through beekeeping, which have replaced honey
hunting today in most parts of the world. The environment in honey is so harsh
that all traces from the lactic acid bacteria vanish after a short while.</p><p><b>What would we like to do?</b></p>
<p>It is of crucial importance to find
new natural, ecological and sustainable alternatives in fighting antibiotics
resistance. </p>
<p>We have the capacity to promote
these lactic acid bacteria by a new developed technique and can re-introduce
these into a range of formulations as foods, drinks and or natural based drugs.
Our goal is to use science in guidance by nature. Therefore, we will make
products that are based on the original fresh honey as hunted by honey hunters.
Meaning that the lactic acid bacteria are viable and active in those products.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431940494/jgq9rxnivujqccixmvab.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Early in our research, we saw the
lactic acid bacteria’s antimicrobial and therapeutic properties. They together
as a community possess extremely good antimicrobial properties against all
dangerous germs tested so far in the laboratory and they even kill pathogens
better than relevant antibiotics.</p>
<p>We know by now after almost 10 years
of research that they together produce a myriad of more than hundreds of
compounds that together are stronger and will challenge future resistance
development.</p>
<p>We will not be able to solve all
problems with antibiotic resistance. But we will be able to decrease this
development if we minimize the global use of antibiotics. For this reason we
have localized key areas into which we can make a difference and these are the
following:</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Wound management
for humans and animals</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Mud fever in horses
</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Bovine mastitis</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Throat infections
and colds</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span>Diarrhea caused by
gut infections</p><p>- Prevention of American foulbrood in beekeeping</p><p><b>How does this work?</b></p>
<p>Wild fresh honey has been used as
folk medicine for thousands of years and now we know for the first time in the
history of science why. Wild fresh honey, chased by honey hunters, contains
namely natural millions of beneficial lactic acid bacteria that are very potent
in killing microbes. In ordinary honey or honey-derived products, you find in
stores or from beekeepers, there are <u>no</u> lactic acid bacteria. </p>
<p>We have therefore developed a
technique to multiply these bacteria outside the bees. We multiply the 13
bacteria to high amounts in order to activate and prepare them for delivery.</p>
<p>Our delivery carrier is based on
honey and bee-pollen. These carriers were chosen to mimic their natural
environment, to give the bacteria food during their transportation and to make
them ready for fight.</p>
<p>We would like to deliver tiny
warriors (the lactic acid bacteria) ready to fight against unwanted microbes.
The warriors will need to be carried by something and this is going to be designed
to suit the different environments. </p>
<p>One of the easiest ways to carry our
tiny warriors is using a food vehicle. Therefore we’ll introduce these
bacterial warriors and deliver them by food and beverages containing honey and
bee-pollen. We have been investigating the food vehicles the latest 10 years
and have very good alternatives for that. All vehicles will comprise the tiny
warriors in high numbers prepared in carriers that will be carefully developed
to suit the different environments and to mimic nature. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431940800/sdqdj0wzjilqg1k5ke9d.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>At present</b></p>
<p>Our recent research in the field
shows that the lactic acid bacteria can be used in the fight against dangerous
bacteria and a case study showed that the lactic acid bacteria in a combination
of honey is more effective than antibiotics. </p>
<p>These novel findings could
revolutionize both the academic world and the pharmaceutical industry. The
discovery and research results have led to attention in media worldwide.
Despite this, the journey has not been without obstacles and still it is
extremely difficult to obtain funding to develop the basic idea; <b>to develop a natural alternative to
antibiotics and spread this worldwide to the people that need it most.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Why will we start to develop a medical alternative for treating wounds?</b></p>
<p>Whereas honey has a number of uses,
it is very well known in folk medicine for its beneficial actions within the
wound environment. However, our research has shown that the main reason for its
historical use in wounds as a folk medicine is not the “honey” itself but the
presence of the living beneficial bacteria that we discovered. </p>
<p>We would like to start with the
management of wounds as this has a great impact on public health and economy.
It has been estimated that 4 million people in Europe suffer from wounds, which
exceeds the number of patients with cancer and cerebro-vascular disease.
Chronic wounds often remain unhealed for years, and sometimes decades in a
person. </p>
<p>One of the major complications to
the healing of a wound is the substantial presence of unwanted bacteria and
infections. These wound infections are estimated to cost a normal European
hospital €20 million annually. There are also very often reports about overuse
of antibiotics in wound management. Thus, this is of global concern as we are
facing an emerging risk of antibiotic resistance. </p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Intentions with the crowdfunding</b></p>
<p>The aim of this crowdfunding project
is to collect financial means of preparing a natural alternative to antibiotics
based on the research on lactic acid bacteria and their applications for
animals and humans, while creating the conditions for social entrepreneurship;
i.e. opportunities to spread the actual products to non-profit organizations.</p>
<p>To reach this purpose we need:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>To create a natural
solution for antibiotics and thus help people who need a simple and sustainable
alternative. We know that the 13 lactic acid bacteria kill all germs that they
are exposed to. But to gain acceptance, we first and foremost need human
studies to back up our findings.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>To distribute
knowledge and raise awareness of this folk medicine throughout the world. We
want to back everything up with the historical background by anthropological PhD
studies of indigenous people and cultures that use honey medically in order to
reach the ""best practice"". </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>To go against the
conventional pharmaceutical industry. We want to give back to the people and do
not want to base the discovery as profit-driven but rather to become a social
enterprise/assistance company. Over time, we want to start a fund for
developing countries. </p>

and Alejandra Vásquez (both PhDs in Engineering at Lund University, Sweden)
discovered in 2005 a great number of, previously unknown beneficial bacteria,
which live and developed together with honeybees in an organ called the honey

Honey is a viscous and sweet fluid
produced by honeybees from the nectar of flowers to store it during winter.

quantities. In other words, these massive beneficial bacteria are found within
all honeybees and active in freshly harvested honey found in all continents in
the world. This scientifically explains, why freshly harvest honey has been and
is still used as a folk medicine. 
Alejandra and Tobias’ studies show
that these lactic acid bacteria possess unique antimicrobial properties, which
in turn are the key to use them as a potential alternative to antibiotics.The problem
The increasing antibiotic resistance
is a major worldwide concern and many efforts are on-going in order to find
alternative tools to fight infections. People are looking at natural
environments, but still many search for novel chemical compounds to be used as
future drugs.
Alexander Fleming discovered
penicillin in 1928. Penicillin is a type of antibiotics that molds of the genus
named Penicillium produce to kill
competing microorganisms such as bacteria, a weapon that is. Penicillin does
not work against all bacteria but only on certain ones. However, there are
other microbes as the bacteria called streptomycetes that produce other kind of
antibiotics, which work against bacteria other than penicillin. To sum, some
bacteria or fungi form a sort of substance that they use as weapons against
competing microbes. Man grows up these small living antibiotic factories,
extracting the substance and make pills for sick people who are suffering from
infections. Then as it is only one single substance in high concentrations pathogens
soon begin to acquire defense against it. This is like, pathogens get bombarded
by one single weapon (for instance arrows) and the pathogens build shields
against all the arrows as the pathogens get used to man's widespread fight with
these weapons (in the form of pills). Then people start pouring in more kinds
of antibiotics into pills, much like shooting arrows and cannon balls at the
same time; then pathogens build thicker walls and form in this way resistance.
Today, a drug company can develop a new antibiotic and after a period of about
10 years, pathogens learn how to protect themselves again, once again becoming
resistant to the developed drug.

Our solution
The greatness of using the
discovered 13 collaborating lactic acid bacteria is that they do not produce
only one weapon (one substance such as antibiotics), but together hundreds of
different weapons (substances). And if the lactic acid bacteria are used viable
(which we always do) then they can choose how much of what weapons are needed
and produce them depending on the closest-threatening pathogen. Like a clever
strategy!
Our way of thinking is very
controversial. We want to use viable good bacteria in high amounts as small
weapon factories, which produce only what is needed, without creating
resistance. 
This idea is not compatible with
today's big international efforts to find new antibiotics. Nor is it accepted
that we as researchers and entrepreneurs go completely against already
developed structures. We were young when we made the discovery and to this day
we have no established structures behind our ideas, such as a well-known
university professor or a pharmaceutical company.
The concept is revolutionary and the
lactic acid bacteria are simply too good to dump them at a high price. While,
we would instead focus on making a contribution to society and produce natural,
simple and sustainable alternatives to antibiotics that will help people
worldwide. They will do good to all who need them, but we cannot do this
ourselves without financial support, we need help to realize our dream and we
want to share this road with you!Why hasn’t this been discovered before?
The beneficial bacteria are only
viable outside the bees during a few weeks as in honey harvested from wild bee
colonies by honey hunters. They are not present in any mature honey or honey
derived products harvested through beekeeping, which have replaced honey
hunting today in most parts of the world. The environment in honey is so harsh
that all traces from the lactic acid bacteria vanish after a short while.What would we like to do?
It is of crucial importance to find
new natural, ecological and sustainable alternatives in fighting antibiotics
resistance. 
We have the capacity to promote
these lactic acid bacteria by a new developed technique and can re-introduce
these into a range of formulations as foods, drinks and or natural based drugs.
Our goal is to use science in guidance by nature. Therefore, we will make
products that are based on the original fresh honey as hunted by honey hunters.
Meaning that the lactic acid bacteria are viable and active in those products.
Early in our research, we saw the
lactic acid bacteria’s antimicrobial and therapeutic properties. They together
as a community possess extremely good antimicrobial properties against all
dangerous germs tested so far in the laboratory and they even kill pathogens
better than relevant antibiotics.
We know by now after almost 10 years
of research that they together produce a myriad of more than hundreds of
compounds that together are stronger and will challenge future resistance
development.
We will not be able to solve all
problems with antibiotic resistance. But we will be able to decrease this
development if we minimize the global use of antibiotics. For this reason we
have localized key areas into which we can make a difference and these are the
following:
- 
Wound management
for humans and animals
- 
Mud fever in horses

- 
Bovine mastitis
- 
Throat infections
and colds
- 
Diarrhea caused by
gut infections- Prevention of American foulbrood in beekeepingHow does this work?
Wild fresh honey has been used as
folk medicine for thousands of years and now we know for the first time in the
history of science why. Wild fresh honey, chased by honey hunters, contains
namely natural millions of beneficial lactic acid bacteria that are very potent
in killing microbes. In ordinary honey or honey-derived products, you find in
stores or from beekeepers, there are no lactic acid bacteria. 
We have therefore developed a
technique to multiply these bacteria outside the bees. We multiply the 13
bacteria to high amounts in order to activate and prepare them for delivery.
Our delivery carrier is based on
honey and bee-pollen. These carriers were chosen to mimic their natural
environment, to give the bacteria food during their transportation and to make
them ready for fight.
We would like to deliver tiny
warriors (the lactic acid bacteria) ready to fight against unwanted microbes.
The warriors will need to be carried by something and this is going to be designed
to suit the different environments. 
One of the easiest ways to carry our
tiny warriors is using a food vehicle. Therefore we’ll introduce these
bacterial warriors and deliver them by food and beverages containing honey and
bee-pollen. We have been investigating the food vehicles the latest 10 years
and have very good alternatives for that. All vehicles will comprise the tiny
warriors in high numbers prepared in carriers that will be carefully developed
to suit the different environments and to mimic nature. At present
Our recent research in the field
shows that the lactic acid bacteria can be used in the fight against dangerous
bacteria and a case study showed that the lactic acid bacteria in a combination
of honey is more effective than antibiotics. 
These novel findings could
revolutionize both the academic world and the pharmaceutical industry. The
discovery and research results have led to attention in media worldwide.
Despite this, the journey has not been without obstacles and still it is
extremely difficult to obtain funding to develop the basic idea; to develop a natural alternative to
antibiotics and spread this worldwide to the people that need it most.

Why will we start to develop a medical alternative for treating wounds?
Whereas honey has a number of uses,
it is very well known in folk medicine for its beneficial actions within the
wound environment. However, our research has shown that the main reason for its
historical use in wounds as a folk medicine is not the “honey” itself but the
presence of the living beneficial bacteria that we discovered. 
We would like to start with the
management of wounds as this has a great impact on public health and economy.
It has been estimated that 4 million people in Europe suffer from wounds, which
exceeds the number of patients with cancer and cerebro-vascular disease.
Chronic wounds often remain unhealed for years, and sometimes decades in a
person. 
One of the major complications to
the healing of a wound is the substantial presence of unwanted bacteria and
infections. These wound infections are estimated to cost a normal European
hospital €20 million annually. There are also very often reports about overuse
of antibiotics in wound management. Thus, this is of global concern as we are
facing an emerging risk of antibiotic resistance. 
Intentions with the crowdfunding
The aim of this crowdfunding project
is to collect financial means of preparing a natural alternative to antibiotics
based on the research on lactic acid bacteria and their applications for
animals and humans, while creating the conditions for social entrepreneurship;
i.e. opportunities to spread the actual products to non-profit organizations.
To reach this purpose we need:
· 
To create a natural
solution for antibiotics and thus help people who need a simple and sustainable
alternative. We know that the 13 lactic acid bacteria kill all germs that they
are exposed to. But to gain acceptance, we first and foremost need human
studies to back up our findings.
· 
To distribute
knowledge and raise awareness of this folk medicine throughout the world. We
want to back everything up with the historical background by anthropological PhD
studies of indigenous people and cultures that use honey medically in order to
reach the ""best practice"". 
· 
To go against the
conventional pharmaceutical industry. We want to give back to the people and do
not want to base the discovery as profit-driven but rather to become a social
enterprise/assistance company. Over time, we want to start a fund for
developing countries. 
Budget
The running costs for reaching the
first goal of the project is 365,000 USD to fund
the two first years and to be able to share products with non-profit
organizations. But the project needs to be funded for a longer time in order to
continuously fight global antibiotic resistance.
The contributions and perks will
cover more research and development, materials, travel expenses,
anthropological studies, production of pilot products and perks, a constant
communication with the funders during the project time and production for
non-profit organizations.
Project owners
The researchers and entrepreneurs
involved are Alejandra Vasquez and Tobias Olofsson, responsible for the
research and development of pilot products. Richard Edbertsson will be in
charge of the anthropology studies and communication of the project.
The project's unique mission
The idea is to develop natural
alternatives to antibiotics, easily available medical products based on the
unique discovery and research by PhD Alejandra Vásquez and PhD Tobias Olofsson;
that wild fresh honey contains the largest concentration of collaborating beneficial
bacteria. And to give back this knowledge to the people that need the once well-known
ancient folk medicine.Who are we?
We are at the crossroads between
tradition and innovation. Our products will be created in the encounter between
nature and research. 
We sit on a broad knowledge base
that extends between all areas related to the new discovered honeybee lactic
acid bacteria. As researchers with empirical data that supports our statements,
we never guess, but always give an informed answer based on facts. 
Innovators and entrepreneurs – In 2007, Tobias and Alejandra started together with the
university a spin-off company ​​with a view to commercialize the applications
of their discovery and translate it into actual products in the areas of
functional foods, veterinary and human medicine. They retained the majority of
the shares in order to be able to fulfill their visions combining research with
entrepreneurship. In 2010 they launched their first product H13 with help of
non-profit organizations in Sweden. H13 is ""Wild fresh honey on the go”. It
mimics wild fresh honey and H stands for honey and 13 stands for the 13 living
Lactic Acid Bacteria.
PhD, Alejandra Vásquez – born in
Valparaiso, Chile. She came to Sweden with her parents as a foreigner at the age of 13 in the middle of
the 80s. After a challenging trip she reached her dream to
become a researcher at Lund University, Sweden. She is a Medical Microbiologist
with a PhD in engineering that works with basic and applied microbiological
research and with innovation in mind.
PhD, Tobias Olofsson – born in Höganäs,
Sweden. He grew up in a nature-interested family. His beekeeping grandfather
(Tage Kimblad) introduced him to the world of honeybees and honey. He is a
molecular biologist with a PhD in engineering that works by developing research
ideas and innovation in mind together with Alejandra.
Ethnographer, Rikard Edbertsson – He came in contact with Alejandra
and Tobias a couple of years ago and is a part of their research group as well
as their spin-off company. He holds a M.A. in History and a B.Sc. in Social Anthropology
and is especially interested in the medicinal uses of honey and honey-based
products throughout history. By using ethnographic methods, his aim is to become
a PhD student and examine how indigenous people have traded down knowledge about
the medicinal use of honey as oral history.

Alejandra,
Tobias and Rikard, form the core of Living Antibiotics, and their jointly
competence spans from research to entrepreneurship, from microbiology to the
humanities and from ideas to applications.Other Ways You Can

We are looking to bring in around $2500 USD. We've got a few big things on our wishlist that will really help get this venture going.
Truth be told, as a food business, we have some licensing and insurance costs to negotiate. Canning license, Process authority, Liability, Labeling. Fun stuff! And not with out a price...Your support can help set us on course, and get new flavors to the People!
Another important addition to our aresenal would be a high-volume commercial blender. This could really amp up our output and speed it up to boot! We are looking into getting a vitamix, which is about as good as it gets, but it'll set us back. That's why your help could get us over the hump. Whether we reach our goal or not, your support will surely get some of the paperwork and hoops tied up. Let's see what happens, yeah?!
  Our Impact Together... Our mindset here at Ol'Dirty Sheets is to make not only simple and beautifully crafted sauces(and other spicy culinary concoctions, one day soon we hope!), but to have a positive impact on our world, our culture and our environment. Our sincerest hope is that we can all come together in this, both personally and finacially, and that is a big consideration in this campaign. We crazy folk here at Ol'Dirty Sheets' think that our world is our responsibility as a people, each and every, no one can go it alone!
Although there are risks with any new venture, We've got some solid footing and expertise to build on. We've spent the better part of the last 5 years developing recipes and doing market research for our expanding line of delicious sauces, and more than 25 years of Culinary experience to hold this ship together. We are really looking forward to bringing the heat, and it's so close that our tounges are already stinging!
We would love any help that you can give us, if that's a few spare dollars or helping to spread the word about our saucy visions! Thank you all so much, we look forward to making this Dream a Reality!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>As in any new business, there are always hurdles to overcome. Just like any ahtlete, we have done the work to reduce our business risk as much as possible. We fully understand that there are always obstacles to overcome when you make it to the big time...or the big game. We just want to ensure that cramps aren't one of them!</p>
<p>Here is a short list of the items we see as potential risks and challenges, and how we plan to overcome them:</p>

In addition, it will give us the flexibility to partner with the right USA-based suppliers that align with our vision of continuous high quality and obtaining the NSF International’s “<i>Certified for Sport</i>” and Natural Products Association’s “<i>Good Manufacturing Practices</i>” certifications.</span>
</li>
<li>
<b>Retail and web store setup:</b> We have excellent contacts that are primed and ready to go place CrampsAWAY in some of the largest U.S. retail stores. We need to show strong growth in order to get prime placement on the shelves of these retailers. The campaign will help us show that there is tremendous need and market interest for a true cramps killer. In addition, our marketing and design teams will set-up our web stores on key sites like Amazon.com and our own CrampsAWAY.com.</li>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hello, 
We're Brad Keller and Daniel O'Neill, co-directors of the 2016 Freestyle (Frisbee) Players Association World Championships. 
In August of 2016,  120 top athletes from 15 nations will arrive in New York City to compete in the premier freestyle disc event of the year. 
Your contribution will help make this event a total success, and give these international competitors and spectators an experience they'll never forget. 
    What We Need & What You Get 
Running a tournament of this scale and importance comes with a lot of expenses. While our campaign goal of $15,000 will only cover a part of the cost, achieving it will be instrumental toward our success. Your contributions will help to pay for:
Outdoor/Indoor site feesInsuranceFood & BeverageTransportationT-shirts & DiscsTrophies & AwardsPromotions & MarketingYouth Outreach & Programming
As a token of our appreciation for your support, we have a few gifts to offer for varying levels of donation. (Any of our perk items can be held for pick-up at the event!)
    The Impact How often do you get to participate in the development of a fast-growing sport?
Well... THIS is your chance!
Recognized this year by the International Olympic Committee, disc sports are now played competitively in over 60 countries. 
With the Freestyle World Championships coming to New York City, we have the perfect venue to take advantage of the current momentum of disc sports popularity, and grow the sport of Freestyle worldwide.

    Challenges Producing any public event in New York City is a challenge. The bureaucracy of scheduling, financing, and running an event of this magnitude is daunting. 
But our experienced team has successfully organized and produced over a dozen disc events in New York City, including The Big Apple Jam, Disc Over New York, Drastic Plastic (1996 FPAW), the Eastern National Championships, and others.  
Under the auspices of the Freestyle Players Association, we have the technical assistance and support to produce this world class event.

Innovation in the energy supplement category has been
relegated to increased caffeine levels or new flavor introductions.  There hasn’t been any real innovation,
until now.  EliteOps Energy
Strips take the “shot” out of energy shots. 

EliteOps Energy Strips are edible, dissolvable strips that provide 100mg of caffeine and 100% of the recommended daily allowance of B-vitamins in a portable, efficient, and convenient manner.  Just peel open an individually wrapped strip, place it on (or under) your tongue and in seconds the strip dissolves giving you energy and focus for hours.We started our “soft” launch in the South Florida area on June 1st, 2015.  Our goal was to secure between 100-200 retail locations so we could test our marketing and advertising efforts and gauge whether we could generate customer support for the product and brand.

<b>The Harmonizer</b> is based on traditional AC Brain Stimulation tools for relaxing and reducing stress. AC stimulation has been found to be completely safe after over 100 years of use worldwide  <i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">(Not to be confused with DC stimulation which can be hazardous because it can polarize the brain, whereas <b>AC stimulation has been proven to be harmless since 1902</b>). </i><div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p><b>AC Brain Stimulation</b> was developed in 1902 in France and later refined in the 1980s by Bob Beck. In the 1990s, Bob, an electrical engineer designed and published documentation on a number of mild electronic stimulation devices used on the ear lobes for relaxation, concentration and stress relief.  We have improved upon Bob’s original design to make it gentler and more versatile and we used modern brain research to improve the design by selecting stimulation frequencies based on real science.  </p>
<p>We worked with Bob Beck’s open source design and consulted modern neuro-science knowledge to come up with a more effective tool for Relaxation and Stress Relief, and we added a Meditation Assistance Frequency.  We manufacture the improved device under the name Mind Body Harmonizer.  We have open sourced the design in the spirit of Bob Beck’s work.</p>
<p>Our design uses the traditional frequencies of stimulation recommended by Bob Beck including 0.5 hz, 100hz and 14.3 hz. </p>
<p><b>Our modern neuroscience based Innovation:</b></p>
<p>We added 40 Hz based on the brain research funded by the Dalai Lama studying Buddhist Meditation and Brain Wave Frequencies. The research showed that experienced monks at the peak of meditation have dominant brain waves at 40 Hz.  Later we discovered that German research showed that gentle 40 Hz stimulation can trigger lucid dreaming.   As we learned more it seemed obvious that 40 Hz needed to be added to the standard set of relaxation device frequencies for many reasons …  </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.peakachievement.com/articles/40_Hertz_History.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.peakachievement.com/articles/40_Hertz_History.htm</a></p>
<p>If you read the article there are many reasons to expect that 40 Hz may be more effective at deep relaxation as well as meditation.</p>
<p>40 Hz brain waves are present in healthy individuals under the age of 65.  They decrease as we age and when the brain does not function optimally.</p>
<p>Our innovation is called <b>“Harmonic Resonance”</b> because 40 Hz stimulation is used in an attempt to encourage a higher brainwave frequency by resonance. Our preference is to keep the machine an inexpensive consumer device with no medical claims.  This allows us to keep the price low and eliminates the product from the ""medical"" category, with its strict regulations. </p>
<p>In the Standard setting, the machine uses a natural brain frequency of 40 hertz which is the Gamma brainwave frequency of a healthy brain.  40 Hz brainwaves are associated with meditation.  The study below shows that German researchers were able to trigger lucid dreams using 40 Hz applied to the forehead.  Some purchasers are experimenting with this application.  The harmonizer is mainly meant for relaxation and stress reduction without drugs.  It can also be used to assist with learning meditation.  It may or may not induce lucid dreaming … open to amateur self experimenters.  We have no feedback yet on this application.  We encourage amateur self experimentation and collaboration.  There are no other Bob Beck type relaxation devices offering 40 hertz.  </p>
