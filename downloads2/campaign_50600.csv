<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise 30,000 for the film's budget. This is a micro-budget of course but if we can get to this goal we will be able to complete pre-production, filming and post-production. Within that small budget our funds go to many things including -</p>
<p>-Film Insurance, permits, business costs.</p>
<p>-Professional skeleton crew and post facility.</p>
<p>-Basic art design costs and costuming.</p>
<p>-Talent, actual names can only be given after we raise the money we need, if we happen to raise more - then even more people will be brought on the production.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Regardless of the amount contributed to the project, like the project itself, it takes numbers. Many numbers of people contributing many numbers of dollars they can afford!

<p>Without this campaign there is no Torment Road. There is no road horror movie. This is happening because of you and your kindness/greatness. Nothing else.

Nell'arco di tre anni, Oriana farà avanti e indietro <strong>tra Italia e New York, per cercare di incontrare la famosa diva</strong>, sebbene le circostanze non giochino mai a suo favore.</p>

<h3>DUE DONNE CHE HANNO FATTO LA STORIA, A MODO LORO.</h3>
<h3>TWO WOMEN WHO MADE HISTORY IN THEIR OWN WAY |</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Oriana Fallaci</h3>
<p>Oriana Fallaci è stata una giornalista italiana famosa in tutto il mondo, <strong>la prima donna a fare da reporter sul fronte in Vietnam</strong>. Sono ricordate le sue uniche interviste con politici come Kissinger, Gheddafi, l'Ayatollah Khomeini e altre celebrità internazionali. Viene ricordata come un carattere indomito, difficile, una donna emancipata che ha segnato il giornalismo italiano e anche la letteratura, dagli anni ‘50 fino alla sua morte, nel 2006. Oriana iniziò la sua carriera come giornalista già durante l'adolescenza, dopo la guerra, scrivendo sui giornali locali articoli di cronaca nera, sempre con una vena politica e polemica. Venendo da una famiglia di antifascisti, l'esperienza della Resistenza segnò sempre i suoi scritti e i suoi pensieri. <strong>Negli anni '50 iniziò a scrivere per l'Europeo</strong>, che la mandò spesso in giro per il mondo a completare reportage di diversa natura. Uno di questi si trasformò nel <strong>suo primo libro, ""I sette peccati di Hollywood""</strong>, che racconta le sue esperienze alle prese con il mondo degli attori e delle dive, molto lontano dai suoi valori e dai suoi interessi. La prefazione fu scritta da Orson Welles, che, complice il fatto di avere una moglie italiana, diventò subito amico della giornalista e la paragonò a Mata Hari per la sua arguzia nel ricavare le informazioni, uscendone ""senza un graffio"".</p>
<p><strong>Oriana Fallaci was a world-renowed journalist,</strong> the first Italian woman to report from the war<br/>front in Vietnam.<br/>Famous are her unique interviews with politicians like Kissinger, Gaddafi, Ayatollah Khomeini and<br/>many international celebrities. <strong>She is remembered as a fierce character</strong>, a prominent female journalist - from the 50s until her death in 2006, wearing trousers and living “like a man” back when it was very unusual, especially in Italy.<br/><strong>Oriana started her career as a journalist straight after the Second World War by writing in local press in Florence.</strong><br/>The experience of the war will have a huge impact on her strong opinionated character.<br/>In the 50s she wrote for the Europeo newspaper, which assigned her many jobs around the<br/>world. One of these was a collection of interviews with the big stars of Hollywood, which she transformed in a minutious, honest and funny report in her first book, Seven Sins of Hollywood<br/>(1958). <strong>The preface is written by Orson Welles</strong>, who befriended her very quickly upon her arrival to Hollywood and who compared her to Mata Hari for her sharp eye, ability to sneak in, get the information she wanted and yet blend in without being noticed as an outsider.</p>

<h3>I PERSONAGGI | Marilyn Monroe</h3>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Marilyn Monroe,</strong> d'altra parte, stava vivendo il suo ultimo decennio, pieno di successi e ostacoli. Dopo aver rotto con la Fox, si avvicinò molto al fotografo Milton Greene, con cui fondò la casa di produzione MMP. Si spostò dunque dalla California a New York e decise di dedicarsi al suo miglioramento come attrice e al cambiamento di alcune persone chiave intorno a sè. Dopo il divorzio da Joe Di Maggio, si fidanzò subito con lo scrittore Arthur Miller. <strong>All'inizio del 1956 si risposò e riuscì ad ottenere un contratto più vantaggioso con la Fox.</strong> La stessa stampa che l'aveva affossata e ridicolizzata per il suo forte desiderio di cambiare l'immagine di se stessa come un'attrice frivola, iniziò a lodarla per il suo successo e la sua tenacia. Decise di dedicarsi quasi completamente alla vita matrimoniale con il suo nuovo marito, vivendo tra Connecticut e New York. Gli aborti spontanei e l'uso di droghe da parte sua deteriorarono molto il suo rapporto con Arthur, che terminò durante o poco dopo le riprese di ""The Misfits"". Morì da sola, nel 1962, nella sua casa di Los Angeles, dopo il suo terzo divorzio, senza figli o altri membri della famiglia ad occuparsi di lei. Diventò un'icona di Hollywood.</p>
<p><strong>Marilyn Monroe</strong>, on the other hand, was living through the last successful yet tumoultuos decade<br/>of her life.<br/>After fighting with Fox and breaking her contract, she became very close to the photographer<br/>Milton Greene, with whom she founded the production company MMP.<br/>She moved from California to NYC and decided to dedicate her time to studying her craft and<br/><strong>changed a lot of the people around her.</strong> Already divorced from Joe DiMaggio, she then became<br/>engaged to Arthur Miller.<br/><strong>By the beginning of 1956, She was newly married, had won the battle with Fox and<br/>managed to get a fairer contract for herself.</strong><br/>The same press that was undermining her dispute with Fox, ridiculng her prerogative of changing<br/>the perception of herself as a frivolous actress, was now praising her success and her strength.<br/>Troubled by this lifestyle and up and downs, she decided to dedicate herself to a quiet family life<br/>with her new husband Arthur Miller between Connecticut and New York.<br/>Marilyn will face a couple of miscarriages during her marriage, which will deteriorate heavily<br/>during the filming of The Misfits, also due to a more and more increasing addiction to drugs.<br/><strong>She’ll die in 1962</strong> in her house in Los Angeles, after her third divorce, without any kids. <strong>She is now considered a Hollywood icon.</strong></p>

Logline
An audacious Italian journalist, after interviewing the most powerful people on Earth, is sent to Hollywood to chase her most evasive subject yet - Marilyn Monroe.



SINOSSI/SYNOPSIS
Oriana Fallaci, una giornalista sui trent'anni nel fiore della sua carriera, arriva in America per intervistare alcuni fra i divi più conosciuti di Hollywood. Il suo ultimo obiettivo è Marilyn Monroe, che, come Oriana, è al picco della sua fama. Durante la sua ""caccia"" a Marilyn, Oriana si confronta con diverse persone, tra cui il regista Jean Negulesco, che la mette subito in guardia sulla difficoltà dell'impresa. Testarda, Oriana si reca comunque a New York dove altri colleghi la scoraggeranno prima di offrirle comunque il loro aiuto. Uno di questi le presenterà Irving Hoffman, un famoso pubblicista nel settore che ce la metterà tutta per aiutare Oriana a cercare Marilyn e farle avere un appuntamento con lei. Nell'arco di tre anni, Oriana farà avanti e indietro tra Italia e New York, per cercare di incontrare la famosa diva, sebbene le circostanze non giochino mai a suo favore.
Oriana Fallaci, a well known journalist in her thirties, arrives in America to complete a series of interviews with the best known actors in Hollywood. Her final target is Marilyn Monroe, who, like Oriana, is at the peak of her fame and prime.In her hunt for Marilyn, Oriana confronts the director Jean Negulesco, who warns her about the difficulty of her pursuit. Unafraid, Oriana travels straight to New York City where other colleagues will also discourage her before offering their help. One of these colleagues will introduce her to Irving Hoffman, a famous publicist who will put a lot of effort into tracking down Marilyn.In the span of 3 years, Oriana will come back to NYC three times to chase a meeting with the elusive diva, only to be stopped everytime she manages to get close.



DUE DONNE CHE HANNO FATTO LA STORIA, A MODO LORO.
TWO WOMEN WHO MADE HISTORY IN THEIR OWN WAY |
 
Oriana Fallaci
Oriana Fallaci è stata una giornalista italiana famosa in tutto il mondo, la prima donna a fare da reporter sul fronte in Vietnam. Sono ricordate le sue uniche interviste con politici come Kissinger, Gheddafi, l'Ayatollah Khomeini e altre celebrità internazionali. Viene ricordata come un carattere indomito, difficile, una donna emancipata che ha segnato il giornalismo italiano e anche la letteratura, dagli anni ‘50 fino alla sua morte, nel 2006. Oriana iniziò la sua carriera come giornalista già durante l'adolescenza, dopo la guerra, scrivendo sui giornali locali articoli di cronaca nera, sempre con una vena politica e polemica. Venendo da una famiglia di antifascisti, l'esperienza della Resistenza segnò sempre i suoi scritti e i suoi pensieri. Negli anni '50 iniziò a scrivere per l'Europeo, che la mandò spesso in giro per il mondo a completare reportage di diversa natura. Uno di questi si trasformò nel suo primo libro, ""I sette peccati di Hollywood"", che racconta le sue esperienze alle prese con il mondo degli attori e delle dive, molto lontano dai suoi valori e dai suoi interessi. La prefazione fu scritta da Orson Welles, che, complice il fatto di avere una moglie italiana, diventò subito amico della giornalista e la paragonò a Mata Hari per la sua arguzia nel ricavare le informazioni, uscendone ""senza un graffio"".
Oriana Fallaci was a world-renowed journalist, the first Italian woman to report from the warfront in Vietnam.Famous are her unique interviews with politicians like Kissinger, Gaddafi, Ayatollah Khomeini andmany international celebrities. She is remembered as a fierce character, a prominent female journalist - from the 50s until her death in 2006, wearing trousers and living “like a man” back when it was very unusual, especially in Italy.Oriana started her career as a journalist straight after the Second World War by writing in local press in Florence.The experience of the war will have a huge impact on her strong opinionated character.In the 50s she wrote for the Europeo newspaper, which assigned her many jobs around theworld. One of these was a collection of interviews with the big stars of Hollywood, which she transformed in a minutious, honest and funny report in her first book, Seven Sins of Hollywood(1958). The preface is written by Orson Welles, who befriended her very quickly upon her arrival to Hollywood and who compared her to Mata Hari for her sharp eye, ability to sneak in, get the information she wanted and yet blend in without being noticed as an outsider.
 


I PERSONAGGI | Marilyn Monroe

Marilyn Monroe, d'altra parte, stava vivendo il suo ultimo decennio, pieno di successi e ostacoli. Dopo aver rotto con la Fox, si avvicinò molto al fotografo Milton Greene, con cui fondò la casa di produzione MMP. Si spostò dunque dalla California a New York e decise di dedicarsi al suo miglioramento come attrice e al cambiamento di alcune persone chiave intorno a sè. Dopo il divorzio da Joe Di Maggio, si fidanzò subito con lo scrittore Arthur Miller. All'inizio del 1956 si risposò e riuscì ad ottenere un contratto più vantaggioso con la Fox. La stessa stampa che l'aveva affossata e ridicolizzata per il suo forte desiderio di cambiare l'immagine di se stessa come un'attrice frivola, iniziò a lodarla per il suo successo e la sua tenacia. Decise di dedicarsi quasi completamente alla vita matrimoniale con il suo nuovo marito, vivendo tra Connecticut e New York. Gli aborti spontanei e l'uso di droghe da parte sua deteriorarono molto il suo rapporto con Arthur, che terminò durante o poco dopo le riprese di ""The Misfits"". Morì da sola, nel 1962, nella sua casa di Los Angeles, dopo il suo terzo divorzio, senza figli o altri membri della famiglia ad occuparsi di lei. Diventò un'icona di Hollywood.

Already divorced from Joe DiMaggio, she then becameengaged to Arthur Miller.By the beginning of 1956, She was newly married, had won the battle with Fox andmanaged to get a fairer contract for herself.The same press that was undermining her dispute with Fox, ridiculng her prerogative of changingthe perception of herself as a frivolous actress, was now praising her success and her strength.Troubled by this lifestyle and up and downs, she decided to dedicate herself to a quiet family lifewith her new husband Arthur Miller between Connecticut and New York.Marilyn will face a couple of miscarriages during her marriage, which will deteriorate heavilyduring the filming of The Misfits, also due to a more and more increasing addiction to drugs.She’ll die in 1962 in her house in Los Angeles, after her third divorce, without any kids. She is now considered a Hollywood icon.
 



GENERE E STILE | GENRE AND STYLE
La storia vuole essere comica, tagliente e ironica. I continui colpi di scena faranno incuriosire l'audience, facendolo simpatizzare con Oriana e la sua disperata e comica ricerca di Marilyn.
The story is comical, sharp, ironic. The constant twists in the plot will engage with the audience, making it symphatise with Oriana while she's desperately looking for Marilyn.

<h3>The Film</h3>
<p><i>More Than a Feeling</i> is a dark comedy set at a funeral. It is about ego and insecurity and how we often forget that even though we think everyone is judging us all the time, the truth is that everyone is mostly selfish and thinking almost exclusively about themself.</p>
<p>Nowadays, when somebody dies people post to social media with a picture of themself and the deceased person. It isn't enough to honor the dead, but we must honor the dead along with ourselves to make sure that we are effectively broadcasting to the world that we're sad because we were friends with the dead person and we want to remind everyone of that. Our intentions are good, but our subconscious need for constant affirmation can get the best of us.</p>
<p>This short film is a dark, comedic examination of this weakness.</p>

Now he has cut loose and is trying to take the next step in his filmmaking ""journey.""</p>
<p><strong>Julia Grimm (Producer)</strong> is an LA-based Producer and Videographer with Jersey blood and a California vibe (wears crop tops). After receiving a degree in Film and Television from Boston University, she launched her career as a producer at Sundance award-winning Interloper Films. She's shot documentaries in Beijing and coordinated commercials in Australia. She currently works as a Production Manager at Super Deluxe, and continues to produce side projects big and small because it’s FUN. She also likes to do headstands while her cats watch judgmentally.</p>
<p><strong>Hayden Mason (DP)</strong> is a talented DP who never sent in his bio, so now it is being written for him. Hailing from Chattanooga, Tennessee, Hayden did his undergrad at Harvard, graduate work at Stanford and did his doctorate at MIT before throwing it all away to pursue the film industry.</p>
<p><strong>Lily Escobar (Art)</strong> is an artist and budget wizard. Cal first had Lily as a PA at Super Deluxe and after working with her once, requested that she be on every single shoot of his.

<p><strong>Jonathan Hinman (AD)</strong> is a comedy writer and producer from New York with a degree in drama and a background in assistant directing. His recent work includes Brandon Rogers's 20-episode series <i>Stuff &amp; Sam</i> for Facebook Watch, and two season of the Fullscreen original series Magic Funhouse.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We took a big risk. We could have stopped production when the financing disappeared, but we were already in too deep. The entire crew was on board, locations booked and rehearsals had begun. So Callum put it on his credit card and his lovely girlfriend supported him in his very irresponsible decision.</p>
<p>A lot of the expenses are on a credit card and then the crew is ""Net-30"" which means that we have 30 days to from the date of the shoot to pay them. This campaign is short so that hopefully we can raise enough money quickly enough to pay everyone on time.</p>
<p>There are other costs that continue to build up as we get through post ($), get the film mixed ($$), colored ($$$) and submitted to festivals ($$$$).</p>
<p>Anything helps. If you're still reading, this is almost over!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I know there are much greater causes out there like RAICES and Planed Parenthood that are much more deserving of donations, but if you can spare any money to help out with this project, it is very appreciated. If you can't but you still want to help, please share this on Facebook, Instagram, etc. Or if you just don't fuck with this at all, but then you see the short film eventually and you really like it, or just kinda like it, tell your friends about it. But it won't be available to the public for a little while because we are sending it out to film festivals and a lot of them require that the submissions have not yet been made public.</p>
</div></div>","The Film
More Than a Feeling is a dark comedy set at a funeral. It is about ego and insecurity and how we often forget that even though we think everyone is judging us all the time, the truth is that everyone is mostly selfish and thinking almost exclusively about themself.
Nowadays, when somebody dies people post to social media with a picture of themself and the deceased person. It isn't enough to honor the dead, but we must honor the dead along with ourselves to make sure that we are effectively broadcasting to the world that we're sad because we were friends with the dead person and we want to remind everyone of that. Our intentions are good, but our subconscious need for constant affirmation can get the best of us.
This short film is a dark, comedic examination of this weakness.

<h3><u>What We Need</u></h3>
<p>Making a historical war drama is costly.   Our budget includes costs for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Camera, lighting, and grip equipment</li>
<li>War re-enactment facilities (National Museum of the Pacific War)</li>
<li>Other location rentals</li>
<li>Onsite catering</li>
<li>Housing of cast and crew (including our lovable animal actors!)</li>
<li>Set decor, wardrobe, etc.</li>
<li>Pay for cast and crew</li>
<li>Insurance</li>
<li>Post-production efforts (editing, music licensing, visual effects)</li>
<li>Marketing efforts</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe our budget goal will allow us to make the most special film we can - One that will  bring world wide attention to the military working dog community - One that will make way for a feature film - and one that will win awards!</p>
<h3><u>What You Get</u></h3>
<p>Our perk packages are mainly focused on providing our backers with Walking Point memorabilia, movie credits, and social media recognition.   There are also perks available for those that seek to be a bit more involved in the project like producer credits and VIP passes to a Private Screening event.  We even have opportunities for corporate sponsors that include product placement in the film!   Those that donate at the Producer level and above will have the opportunity to spend a few hours on set and watch the filming process!   If you have inquiries about donation amounts not listed, collaboration, or providing services in lieu of a donation, please contact us.  We would love to hear from you!</p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>The Impact</u></h3>
<p><u>Your contributions will help bring to the silver screen the noble actions of the WWII military working dogs, our soldiers, and the undying patriotism of those families that donated their beloved canine companions to the Armed Forces.</u>   This is a film that doesn't shy away from faith, family, or patriotism.  In fact, the film focuses on these core values and our hope is that those values shine through for the world to see.  </p>
<p>During the liberation of Guam, 25 military working dogs died in combat.  Their bodies were buried on the island in a small cemetery.  These dogs saved many lives and help free the island of Guam and the Chamorro natives from the clutches of the Japanese Empire.   The acclaimed sculptor, Susan Bahary (who also wrote the foreword for Walking Point) commissioned the first Military Working Dog Memorial in honor of these heroic canines.  Her masterpiece still remains on the island today. </p>
<p>After Susan read the first four manuscript chapters she remarked, ""I read the manuscript today and loved it. It made me cry a few times already! I appreciated its sensitivity and way of teaching a bit of this important history. A story like this brings back some of the treasured ideals of our country and our patriotism. It brings to mind life's simple pleasures and the hard work of everyday people who we can all thank for our freedom and the country we enjoy today.""</p>
<p>Your contributions will help younger generations gain a better appreciation of our past history.  </p>

<p><strong>About the Creators:</strong></p>
<p><i>Anna Rose</i> is a contemporary dancer, choreographer, and singer, hailing from the Shawangunk mountains of New York.  She received her early dance training in a variety of classical, folk, and percussive dance forms, and has performed and taught extensively at festivals and venues across the U.S. with The Vanaver Caravan dance company.  In 2016, Rose graduated with her BFA in dance from NYU Tisch School of the Arts where she choreographed, presented, and performed numerous works.  Rose is currently based in Berlin, where she freelances as a dancer and choreographer, and has had the pleasure of enriching her own practice through continued study and exchange with a variety of international dance artists and companies.</p>
<p><i>Katie Sadler</i> is a documentary, narrative, and short-form storyteller who graduated from NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts in 2017. With a BFA in film &amp; television production and a minor in dance, she practices multiple artistic disciplines and combines them in any way that she can. Sadler has worked with companies including Columbia Records, Red Bull, MacGuffin Films, PBS, Nylon, NBC and is now working as a producer at Buzzfeed. While directing documentaries and music videos is her main passion, Katie also edits, produces, and shoots a variety of projects and is a lover of all forms of storytelling.</p>
<p><strong>Why we are asking for your help/ A note from the creators:</strong></p>
<p><i>In Between</i> is a passion project, and the first independent artistic endeavor undertaken by the two of us after graduating from University.  We are interested in exploring different methods of storytelling, and the unique possibilities to do this that can be found by way of fusing film and dance.  Venturing into these waters, we hope to bring the two art forms into conversation in a way that is fresh, and provides a new type of viewing experience for our audience.</p>
<p>Out of sheer determination to bring this work to fruition, we have managed to cover all production costs thus far out-of-pocket, and are essentially aiming to break even by the end of the project.  Coming out of this without financial loss will mean that we are both able to continue creating and investing in future projects.</p>
<p>It is incredibly important to us that we are able to properly compensate the other artists who have been involved, and so a very significant portion of funds raised will be allocated to this.</p>
<p>Your help means the world to us, and no donation or amount of help is too small!   We are incredibly grateful for all forms of support, whether what you are able to offer is a financial contribution or a share.</p>

This was in the year 2000. I planted them and have had Tulsi growing near me ever since. I have come to know her powers as a medicine, which I’ve made many times from her leaves, flowers and seeds, but she has impacted my life in other ways too.</p><p>A year after I first met Tulsi the plant, I adopted my baby daughter from India. Before I even knew of her, the orphanage had named her Tulsi and matched her with me! In her honour, I began to delve into the myths and stories of Tulsi, the Goddess, and into the songs and healing properties of Tulsi, the plant. I began reading and questioning herbalists and Indians about her medicinal, ecological and spiritual properties. I began developing the concept for this film.</p><p> </p><p><strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong></p><p>For this initial Pre-Production phase, we need $27,000. This will allow Chitra to write the story, and Tish to adapt her story into a screenplay. It will also fund some travel and research, further fundraising, the Indiegogo fees, and the creation of a full web site devoted to the film. If we're careful and lucky we will have some funds left to pay a nominal fee to the crew who have been working so hard to get the film off the ground.</p><p>If, with your INCREDIBLE support, we can reach our stretch goal of $54,000 we will be able to begin filming (we’ll send you some sneak previews) as early as next Spring.</p><p> </p><p><strong>BUDGET</strong></p><p>The total budget for the film, which will take three years to make, is $600,000.

<li>
<strong>Jagran Jan Vikas Samiti</strong> hosted us at their Guni (traditional healers) gathering in Delhi and introduced us to Pratabi Bai, Birbal Bishnoi and other herbalists.</li>
<li> <strong>Prashanti de Jager</strong> and the <strong>Organic India</strong> team hosted us at their Tulsi Mahotsva (festival), introduced us to Tulsi farmer, Kailash Singh, and Tulsi researcher, Dr. Narendra Singh. </li>
<li>
<strong>Ashish Maurya</strong> donated in-kind services as cinematographer, sound recordist, gaffer, translator and more.</li>
<li>
<strong>Abigail Wright</strong> and <strong>Erin Henry</strong> have donated weeks of their time and energy to many producing tasks.</li>
<li>
<strong>NYSCA</strong> (New York State Council on the Arts) awarded a grant to composer Sarah Plant to score a sample video of <strong><i>Tulsi, Queen of Herbs</i></strong>.</li>
<li>All the generous people and companies who have donated perks (see below).</li>
</ul><p>Donations of $500 or more can be made tax deductible through our nonprofit fiscal sponsor, DER (Documentary Educational Resources). For more information, please email: tish@streeten.net</p><p> </p><p><strong>WHY YOU ARE ESSENTIAL </strong></p><p>After this initial Indiegogo campaign, we plan to raise money from grants, foundations, companies as well as from more individuals like you. We’ll put on fund-raising events (involving a Tulsi workshop, a talk, a dinner). This unusual kind of film will mainly be supported by individuals like you who care about plants, people, animals and the planet.</p><p>This is not your typical social issue documentary although - of course - it does address urgent social concerns. We want this film to inspire people now and in the future, and to do this we must step outside of convention and reach deep into the creative world. The beauty and the challenge of this film is that it does not fit neatly, or even messily, into any category or box. This makes it much more difficult to get foundation and television grants. Thus, YOU are absolutely VITAL to getting this film made.</p><p> </p><p><strong>WHAT YOU GET - PERKS</strong></p><p>As you can see, we have divided the Perks into the 8 names of Tulasi:</p><p><strong>TULASI</strong> - She who has no comparison, she who balances</p><p><strong>PUSPASARA</strong> - She who is the essence of all flowers </p><p><strong>VRINDA</strong> - She who is the goddess of all plants and trees</p><p><strong>VRINDAVANI</strong> - She who never leaves Vrindavan    </p><p><strong>NANDINI</strong> - She who gives happiness to everyone</p><p><strong>KRISHNA-JIVANI</strong> - She who is the life and soul of Krishna</p><p><strong>VISVAPUJITA</strong> - She whom the whole universe worships</p><p><strong>VISVAPAVANI</strong> - She who purifies the three worlds</p><p>We are really happy to have such good friends and companies who believe in and are supporting the film. These people have donated their Tulsi products, their books, their films and other exciting perks which we are offering as a thank you for your pledge of support. We wholeheartedly support the work of these individuals and companies. Like all of us, they are working with and for the plants, people and planet. If you don’t already know of these people and companies, please check out their web sites (below). We’ll be posting more information on all our sponsors on our Facebook page.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510941523/sdwvjtudiibxih0dp2uq.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>RISKS and CHALLENGES</strong></p><p>For me, Tish, there are two huge challenges in making this film. These happen also to be what is most exhilarating about the project. The first challenge is the fact that never before has there been a film with a plant as the main character. We are going into unknown and unexplored territory. Will we be able to truly create a sense of magical realism, in which we hear the voice of the plants, in which we have a visceral sense of the unseen? Will we be able to make the invisible  felt and experienced?</p><p>The second challenge for me as a long-time documentary filmmaker will be in creating the fiction/mythological scenes. I have never written or worked from a script, I have never directed actors, nor produced all the other elements of a non-documentary film. However, because I will be working with such luminaries like Chitra Divakaruni and veteran Malayalam filmmakers Sanjeev Sivan and all the Sivan filmmaking family, I am looking forward to expanding my horizons.</p><p>A last, minor challenge, will be integrating the documentary and mythological scenes during the editing process. As an editor by trade and by love, this too presents a new adventure to be met with all the excitement I feel when travelling to new places and meeting people who offer new perspectives.</p><p> </p><p><strong>PRODUCTION SCHEDULE</strong></p><p>November 2017 - May 2018: <strong>Fundraising, Script &amp; Film Development.​</strong></p><p>June - August 2018: <strong>Research &amp; Initial Filming in India, USA and UK</strong></p><p>September - December 2018: <strong>Fundraising, Edit of Trailer</strong></p><p>January - March 2019: <strong>Documentary Production in India, UK and USA</strong></p><p>April - August 2019: <strong>Edit Rough Cut &amp; further fundraising.</strong></p><p>September - October 2019: <strong>Production of Mythological Scenes in India.</strong></p><p>November 2019 - May 2020: <strong>Edit to fine cut, compose music</strong>.</p><p>March - July 2020: <strong>Fundraising for finishing costs, pick-up filming.</strong></p><p>August - October 2020: <strong>Sound mix, colour grade, subtitles.</strong></p><p>November 2020: <strong>Release of</strong> <i><strong>Tulsi, Queen of Herbs</strong></i>.</p><p> </p><p><strong>OTHER WAYS TO CONTRIBUTE and join the Tulsi Community</strong></p><p>We completely understand that not everyone can contribute financially.

I began developing the concept for this film. WHAT WE NEEDFor this initial Pre-Production phase, we need $27,000. This will allow Chitra to write the story, and Tish to adapt her story into a screenplay. It will also fund some travel and research, further fundraising, the Indiegogo fees, and the creation of a full web site devoted to the film. If we're careful and lucky we will have some funds left to pay a nominal fee to the crew who have been working so hard to get the film off the ground.If, with your INCREDIBLE support, we can reach our stretch goal of $54,000 we will be able to begin filming (we’ll send you some sneak previews) as early as next Spring. BUDGETThe total budget for the film, which will take three years to make, is $600,000. With your support of $27,000 (and hopefully $54,000) we can get Tulsi, Queen of Herbs off to a flying start.Pre-Production & Documentary Production: $108,000 $27,000 - Script & Film Development, Research, Fundraising, Web Site$27,000 - Initial Documentary Filming in India, Europe & USA$27,000 - Transcriptions, Translations, Creation of Sample Trailer$27,000 - Complete Documentary Filming in India, Europe & USAMythological Production for Scripted Scenes with Actors: $200,000Post-Production & Finishing Costs: $300,000 MANY THANKS TO OUR SUPPORT NETWORKInitial filming in India and subsequent work have been possible due to the support and in-kind services of the following:

Jagran Jan Vikas Samiti hosted us at their Guni (traditional healers) gathering in Delhi and introduced us to Pratabi Bai, Birbal Bishnoi and other herbalists.
 Prashanti de Jager and the Organic India team hosted us at their Tulsi Mahotsva (festival), introduced us to Tulsi farmer, Kailash Singh, and Tulsi researcher, Dr. Narendra Singh. 

Ashish Maurya donated in-kind services as cinematographer, sound recordist, gaffer, translator and more.

Abigail Wright and Erin Henry have donated weeks of their time and energy to many producing tasks.

NYSCA (New York State Council on the Arts) awarded a grant to composer Sarah Plant to score a sample video of Tulsi, Queen of Herbs.
All the generous people and companies who have donated perks (see below).
Donations of $500 or more can be made tax deductible through our nonprofit fiscal sponsor, DER (Documentary Educational Resources). For more information, please email: tish@streeten.net WHY YOU ARE ESSENTIAL After this initial Indiegogo campaign, we plan to raise money from grants, foundations, companies as well as from more individuals like you. We’ll put on fund-raising events (involving a Tulsi workshop, a talk, a dinner). This unusual kind of film will mainly be supported by individuals like you who care about plants, people, animals and the planet.This is not your typical social issue documentary although - of course - it does address urgent social concerns. We want this film to inspire people now and in the future, and to do this we must step outside of convention and reach deep into the creative world. The beauty and the challenge of this film is that it does not fit neatly, or even messily, into any category or box. This makes it much more difficult to get foundation and television grants. Thus, YOU are absolutely VITAL to getting this film made. WHAT YOU GET - PERKSAs you can see, we have divided the Perks into the 8 names of Tulasi:TULASI - She who has no comparison, she who balancesPUSPASARA - She who is the essence of all flowers VRINDA - She who is the goddess of all plants and treesVRINDAVANI - She who never leaves Vrindavan    NANDINI - She who gives happiness to everyoneKRISHNA-JIVANI - She who is the life and soul of KrishnaVISVAPUJITA - She whom the whole universe worshipsVISVAPAVANI - She who purifies the three worldsWe are really happy to have such good friends and companies who believe in and are supporting the film. These people have donated their Tulsi products, their books, their films and other exciting perks which we are offering as a thank you for your pledge of support. We wholeheartedly support the work of these individuals and companies. Like all of us, they are working with and for the plants, people and planet. If you don’t already know of these people and companies, please check out their web sites (below). We’ll be posting more information on all our sponsors on our Facebook page. RISKS and CHALLENGESFor me, Tish, there are two huge challenges in making this film. These happen also to be what is most exhilarating about the project. The first challenge is the fact that never before has there been a film with a plant as the main character. We are going into unknown and unexplored territory. Will we be able to truly create a sense of magical realism, in which we hear the voice of the plants, in which we have a visceral sense of the unseen? Will we be able to make the invisible  felt and experienced?The second challenge for me as a long-time documentary filmmaker will be in creating the fiction/mythological scenes. I have never written or worked from a script, I have never directed actors, nor produced all the other elements of a non-documentary film. However, because I will be working with such luminaries like Chitra Divakaruni and veteran Malayalam filmmakers Sanjeev Sivan and all the Sivan filmmaking family, I am looking forward to expanding my horizons.A last, minor challenge, will be integrating the documentary and mythological scenes during the editing process. As an editor by trade and by love, this too presents a new adventure to be met with all the excitement I feel when travelling to new places and meeting people who offer new perspectives. PRODUCTION SCHEDULENovember 2017 - May 2018: Fundraising, Script & Film Development.​June - August 2018: Research & Initial Filming in India, USA and UKSeptember - December 2018: Fundraising, Edit of TrailerJanuary - March 2019: Documentary Production in India, UK and USAApril - August 2019: Edit Rough Cut & further fundraising.September - October 2019: Production of Mythological Scenes in India.November 2019 - May 2020: Edit to fine cut, compose music.March - July 2020: Fundraising for finishing costs, pick-up filming.August - October 2020: Sound mix, colour grade, subtitles.November 2020: Release of Tulsi, Queen of Herbs. OTHER WAYS TO CONTRIBUTE and join the Tulsi CommunityWe completely understand that not everyone can contribute financially.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p>The Man and The Hare is a short film being made by a group of year 13 Film and Media Production students at the BRIT School in London. The film follows the story of Chris, a man in his late twenties, who is dealing with grief and goes to a secluded manor to escape it all, however, he finds himself facing the truth more than he would have liked to. The film’s unique qualities are in the ways it explores such a universal experience, through an exaggerated and horrific lens. Exploring the true extent of which loss can distort the human psyche. Having such a heavy topic illustrated by young people brings a real and visceral quality to the film, looking at it from a whole new perspective.   </p><h2> </h2><h2>Our Inspiration:</h2><p>Hereditary is a  tale of family tragedy that curdles into a full-bore nightmare ride through hell. This film translates grief as a moment of extreme vulnerability of the human psyche, which provides the hole form which madness and paranoia may seep in. An idea which forms some of the basic foundation for our plot.</p><p>Another similar aspect of Hereditary is the guessing game the movies play with the audience, making us guess if it’s really a demon or some illness we are not aware of.

The film follows the story of Chris, a man in his late twenties, who is dealing with grief and goes to a secluded manor to escape it all, however, he finds himself facing the truth more than he would have liked to. The film’s unique qualities are in the ways it explores such a universal experience, through an exaggerated and horrific lens. Exploring the true extent of which loss can distort the human psyche. Having such a heavy topic illustrated by young people brings a real and visceral quality to the film, looking at it from a whole new perspective.    Our Inspiration:Hereditary is a  tale of family tragedy that curdles into a full-bore nightmare ride through hell. This film translates grief as a moment of extreme vulnerability of the human psyche, which provides the hole form which madness and paranoia may seep in. An idea which forms some of the basic foundation for our plot.Another similar aspect of Hereditary is the guessing game the movies play with the audience, making us guess if it’s really a demon or some illness we are not aware of. In this same way we play with reality and place the audience in this in-between that complicates our relationship with the protagonist and with the narrative. Dealing with Grief:The subject of grief is one that a lot of people experience throughout their lives. It's an important and relatable process. Grief comes in five stages: denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance, each stage as vital as the next.The film joins Chris in the stage of bargaining, he has retreated to the manor in an attempt to try and escape the consequences of a death back at home. Throughout the course of the film Chris falls into the next stage which is depression. We believe that this is a relatable topic that will connect with most people.  Where The Money Goes:All of the crew are experienced in video production in multiple genres and we want to challenge ourselves to take our production value to next level, this cannot be done without a budget. We are aiming to raise at least £2,000 as this will allow us access to facilities that will help bring our films to life. So the most important thing is, where will your hard earned cash be going? Equipment -  We want to make sure the story is done justice be using the best video,audio and lighting equipment we can get.Actors - We hope to cast semi-professional actors, As this shoot takes place over 4 day we will need to cover travelling cost and also to reward our actors for their hard work.Props and Costumes - This film in particular relies heavily on costume, makeup and art supplies to bring our story to life and to absorb our audience into this world that we have created.Showcasing the Film - After all the heavy lifting is done we hope to premiere our film at a London location and share it with as many people as we can, celebrating our hard work. Impact:The Man And The Hare is valuable project to support as it is a film that displays the delicacy of the human mind. This film is an example of young people pushing themselves to create pieces of work that is meaningful and speaks to their experiences. It is a project that perfectly encapsulates the beauty and the universality of film as an art to tell stories with the aim of making what is personal universal.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a group of student filmmakers from Vancouver Film School who are looking to make their first short film. We have the pleasure of working with a wonderful writer, Eduardo Basile who is a VFS alumni. He has worked hard to create a wonderful script from concept to final draft, and with a title like that, how can anyone resist?</p>
<p>Beyond the catchy title and punchy characters the Biannual Meeting of the Owners of the World (BMOW as we have come to nickname it) holds an important message about the institutions that control our world and the power it gives the people in charge of them. It's a sci-fi politcal satire, think Dr. Strangelove meets Star Trek. </p>
<p>BMOW has something for everyone, with a strong female lead, important social-political commentary and some very interesting characters, its a meeting worth attending. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are excited about this project not only for the important message it provides but because it provides us, as students, with a lot of creative challenges. One of the biggest has been the character design as we are creating unique and individual aliens. Not only has this taken time from our creative team but we've also brought on four incredible make-up artists to help shape our vision and bring it to life. Make-up however is expensive, especially when you want exciting wigs and prosthetics to create ""realistic"" aliens. Much of the money raised will go towards the creation of these alien figures, but don't worry we want you to be part of this process, which is why you can receive the concept work done by the make-up artists showing the character's progression from script to film.</p>
<p>Another expensive element is our set build. This is a story like no other, therefore it can't take place just anywhere. We will be creating a futuristic octagon room  as the octagon has been seen as representing infinity and the coming together of the circle and square. The circle represents the heavens, while the square represents the earth, making the octagon the transitional place of the two. This fits with our story as Dawn represents the earth and must meet with creatures from above to come together to make decisions in this isolated space. While this set will add immensely to a story that mostly occurs in one room, it will require time and money. That's where you come in, and if you really want to be special you can be one of the portraits in the hall of relics. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our short film is a satirical look on the real powers who control our world and we really believe in it. So we are asking you to believe in it too, but more than just believing in the project, we are asking you to believe in us. Yes, your money will help get the short made, but more than that you are investing in our futures. We will use this short as part of our demo reels to prove to other investors in the future that we are worthy of their time and money. </p>

As a young man he apprenticed to pioneers in the Modernist movement. In 1939 he fled the Holocaust, emigrating to Bolivia where he made and lost a fortune.   Coming to the United States in 1943, he built churches, museums and skyscrapers with the great architects of the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century.</p><p>My father’s story is marked by startling paradoxes. The idealistic teenager who was arrested as a communist in Hungary in the 1930s built nuclear missile silos for the U.S. Air Force during the Cold War. For fifty years he hid his identity as a Jew.</p><p>When I embarked on this project it was not to pay tribute to him, but to discover what I could not understand as a child. Tracing the unacknowledged pieces of his identity, I have visited and cleaned the graves of my ancestors in Hungary, and learned what happened to my family during the Holocaust. I have spoken with relatives I never knew existed.  I learned truths that are common to many Central European Jews who left home and made their mark upon the world: a fearful denial of origins, guilt over the fate of family, a certain restlessness, brilliant achievement and tragedy.</p><p>Visit <a href=""https://restlesshungarian.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://restlesshungarian.com/</a> for blog videos, photographs, and essays about the making of The Restless Hungarian</p><p> </p><h3>What this Campaign Supports</h3><p>Your contribution will pay for the shooting of twenty-five scenes to be filmed with actors in Hungary.  They are evocative vignettes based on letters, journals, and an interview I did with Paul late in his life.  Portraying his childhood as well as my own, they complete the production.  They tie together archive film, photographs, interviews, and location footage already acquired for the film. </p><p>My Hungarian producer has put together a highly talented team in Budapest.  I am very fortunate to be working with them.   A cast of sixteen actors (children and adults) and a production crew of twenty will be working for nine, twelve-hour days, to produce the vignettes.  Everyone has committed to work for below-scale wages to support <i>The Restless Hungarian,</i> a universal story of an immigrant told by his son. The budget is $82,000.

Twenty-five films I wrote, produced, and directed have aired nationally on U.S. public television.Reviews at https://www.moiraproductions.com/.I received honors at international film festivals and was awarded the William Benton Fellowship in Broadcast Journalism at the University of Chicago. The Film’s StoryAfter a lifetime of filmmaking, The Restless Hungarian is my most personal and important work.  It is about my father, Paul Weidlinger.  He was an architect and one of the most innovative structural engineers of the 20th century. As a young man he apprenticed to pioneers in the Modernist movement. In 1939 he fled the Holocaust, emigrating to Bolivia where he made and lost a fortune.   Coming to the United States in 1943, he built churches, museums and skyscrapers with the great architects of the mid-20th century.My father’s story is marked by startling paradoxes. The idealistic teenager who was arrested as a communist in Hungary in the 1930s built nuclear missile silos for the U.S. Air Force during the Cold War. For fifty years he hid his identity as a Jew.When I embarked on this project it was not to pay tribute to him, but to discover what I could not understand as a child. Tracing the unacknowledged pieces of his identity, I have visited and cleaned the graves of my ancestors in Hungary, and learned what happened to my family during the Holocaust. I have spoken with relatives I never knew existed.  I learned truths that are common to many Central European Jews who left home and made their mark upon the world: a fearful denial of origins, guilt over the fate of family, a certain restlessness, brilliant achievement and tragedy.Visit https://restlesshungarian.com/ for blog videos, photographs, and essays about the making of The Restless Hungarian What this Campaign SupportsYour contribution will pay for the shooting of twenty-five scenes to be filmed with actors in Hungary.  They are evocative vignettes based on letters, journals, and an interview I did with Paul late in his life.  Portraying his childhood as well as my own, they complete the production.  They tie together archive film, photographs, interviews, and location footage already acquired for the film. My Hungarian producer has put together a highly talented team in Budapest.  I am very fortunate to be working with them.   A cast of sixteen actors (children and adults) and a production crew of twenty will be working for nine, twelve-hour days, to produce the vignettes.  Everyone has committed to work for below-scale wages to support The Restless Hungarian, a universal story of an immigrant told by his son. The budget is $82,000. The Hungarian Government Film Fund, in recognition of the film’s cultural relevance, will pay a rebate of $24,000, resulting in a net cost of $58,000.   Donor GiftsI am asking supporters to contribute $35,000.  Gifts include:—The Restless Hungarian film—streaming access—when it is completed.—A sheet of 25 Restless Hungarian stamps made by Burning Man artist James Cline—A signed copy of my book, The Restless Hungarian, Madness, Modernism, and The American Dream—A T-shirt with the words:  May Truth and Love Prevail Over Lies and Hatred.  This quote is from Václav Havel, the leader of the 1989 Velvet Revolution in Czechoslovakia—A Restless Hungarian T-shirt with Paul Weidlinger’s self-portrait, circa 1936—A set of four of my award winning documentary films—An invitation to a launch party—A private creative consultation with the filmmaker—A range of screen credits and gift packages for donors, key supporters, and major donors.—A day of sailing on San Francisco Bay with the filmmaker. If the $35K Goal is Not Reached  
The shoot will happen.  I am committed to completing the film. After investing years of my time and money, I have taken this project too far not to bring it into the world. I am deeply grateful to those who have already given their support on this journey. The Impact of Your ContributionYour contribution brings the production of the Restless Hungarian to a tipping point.  Following the shooting of the vignettes I will spend about six months editing the film, weaving together all of the elements.   Several drafts of the film, called rough-cuts, will be honed through the editing process.  Feedback from a panel of veteran filmmakers at work-in-progress screenings will help to guide me in shaping the final cut of the film, estimated to be done by September 2020. Value of The Restless Hungarian in the WorldOn the deepest and broadest level The Restless Hungarian is for people who are interested in family origins, how culture and history shape the people who are our grandparents, parents and ultimately, ourselves.  Here is what people are saying about the book, from which the film is distilled. [A] story of the visionary upheavals of the 20th century. . . .

<h3><i>Project Summary</i></h3>
<p>First, thank you to everyone involved in the production of this work to date, cast, crew and friends/supporters.  I never would have made it this far without you.  And thank YOU for your interest in making a campaign contribution.</p>
<p>My adolescent dreams of becoming an actor were tanked in part by the psychotic behavior of someone I considered a trusted educator and friend.  These events coupled with awakening to my innate depressive alien nature served to open my eyes in a fascinatingly horrified way to how the human brain wields such incredible potential to love or destroy other human brains.  This is a lot of what my work is concerned with: fear, abuse, betrayal, corruption of power, busted good intentions and nervous crackling laughter.</p>
<p>Some shade of these themes repeat, central and present in every concert I've ever performed, any song I've ever written and any film I've made.  And though I may eventually try my hand at something purely light and joyful, <strong>WRETCH</strong> is a synthesis of my awareness of the more chaotic and darkly obscure/un-hip life-things, a study of hope, health, superstition, and spirituality.</p>
<ul><li><strong><i>Introduce yourself and your background:</i></strong></li></ul>
<p>My name is Matthew Dunehoo.  I've written music in bands since Cobainism peaked and have never made a steady income from music, acting or film.  I want to make artwork that makes others feel as thankful as I do when I experience the artwork (albums, films, paintings) made by others that I adore, that resonates big in my heart.  This is all I've ever wanted to accomplish.  I am very grateful for my freedom and fortune to explore playing artist.</p>
<ul><li><strong><i>Briefly describe your campaign and why it's important to you.</i></strong></li></ul>
<p>Trying to make a feature film of any value without having gone to film school or logging many more years working in independent film, networking and forging a proper career is plum goofy.  I feel like a poseur and experience a ton of insecurity to the tune of: ""If you were really meant to be a filmmaker, you would have gone to film school or you'd be one of those kids who was ""always filming everything.""  But I've worked very hard to do all this as RIGHT as possible, following a vision, and am unflinching in my intention to share the hard work of my cast and crew with the world in the form of a fierce first feature film.  I cannot afford the costs necessary to finish the job and must appeal to you to help me in this, thank you.</p>
<ul><li><strong><i>Express the magnitude of what contributors will help you achieve.</i></strong></li></ul>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">T</span><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">his film would not have been at all possible without the hard work and inspired creative contributions of the many many many people who I was fortunate in discovering, who lent their time, talent and exhaustion in realizing the many visions for the film, from pre-production assistance, planning, feedback, to the logistical campaign of our 19 consecutive day film shoot, and who will continue to play a role in the film as we get it out into the world. </span></p>
<p>Contributions to this campaign will help me represent all of their work as well the best parts of what I've been able to manifest, to the world.  I have always tried to be a good arts patron and am humbly looking for it now, big time.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong><i>What We Need &amp; What You Get</i></strong></h3>
<p><strong><i>Breaking it down in more detail:</i></strong></p>
<ul><li><strong><i>Explain how much funding you need and where it's going. Be transparent and specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you.</i></strong></li></ul>
<p>The funds earned through this campaign will go towards all remaining post-production expenses (editing, coloring, sound design, score, licenses, film festival submission fees and travel expenses) needed to finish the film. </p>
<p>My hope is that WRETCH gets welcomed into film festivals and I am afforded the opportunity to travel to represent the film where it goes as needed.  I will seek international distribution for the work and try best I can to recoup my expenses wherever possible.</p>
<p>I am also working on my next feature film scripts and outlines so that I can pick up immediately wherever WRETCH leaves off, and keep making work, hopefully better, stronger and more informed work.</p>

<h3><strong><i>Risks &amp; Challenges</i></strong></h3>
<p><strong><i>People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal.</i></strong></p>
<ul><li><i><strong>Share what qualifies you to overcome these hurdles.</strong></i></li></ul>
<p>There is a possibility that the film will not find an audience, will not ever recoup any of the expenses, will not be viewed favorably by the majority of the people who do get to experience it, wherever it winds up.  But I believe it has a better chance of finding its place in the world and thriving there.  I do believe that there is an audience for the film out there who will appreciate it.  This is always an innate risk in putting a piece of art in the world.</p>
<ul><li><i><strong>Describe your plan for solving these challenges.</strong></i></li></ul>
<p>My planning for these challenges began when I first started formulating the plan and vision for the film.  As early as April of 2016 I was holding get togethers with valued peers who were generous enough of their time to come and listen to me labor aloud through the film's outline, before there was even a script.  I was trying to do the diligence to make sure that the plot held interest, that the characters made sense, that the vision of the film seemed to people who were listening to the general gist of the story, made sense.  ""Does this seem like it could be a cool movie to you, if written well?""</p>
<p>Then I spent the time needed, and exercised the discipline needed, I think, to craft a functional screenplay.  I read up on structure guidelines, read other screenplays, and continued to vet versions of the script with anyone who would read and offer feedback.  </p>
<p>It was only when I had a script that I felt had had enough critical feedback and evaluation in my hands, that I was also happy with artistically, that I began pre-production in earnest.  So I was mindful of the challenges from the onset.</p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong><i>Other Ways You Can Help</i></strong></h3>
<p><strong><i>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</i></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong><i>Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign.</i></strong></li>
<li><strong><i>Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!</i></strong></li>

<p>If you are not able to contribute financially, sharing the campaign is greatly appreciated, thank you.</p>

<p>We are relying on the generosity of others to fuel our passion by donating to our campaign. We can't promise a film that everyone will love.

I am currently completing my final semester as a Film and Television major at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts. I first stepped onto the independent film scene as a high schooler when I was cast in Michael Tully’s Sundance feature, Ping Pong Summer. After this incredible experience on set and traveling through the festival circuit, I was inspired to start writing and directing. I enrolled at Fordham University as a Visual Arts major, where I wrote and directed a short film entitled We Regret To Inform You for the 2016 Campus MovieFest. The film was selected as a finalist at the international level of this competition, taking us all the way to the 2017 Cannes International Film Festival. Since I landed at NYU, I have worked nonstop on various student productions, most notably writing, directing, and starring in my last short, Don’t Be a Baby. In addition to these student productions, my ongoing position at the female-led independent production company, Invisible Pictures, has propelled my career and further incited my commitment to unexpected stories told through socially conscious filmmaking. While my training and work has shaped me as an artist, my upbringing has shaped me as a person and equipped me to tell a story as unique as J-1. </p><p>    This film is not autobiographical, but it is so deeply personal. Growing up in Ocean City, a place so close-knit and small during the off season yet so international and vibrant in the summers was incredibly formative for me. I worked in the same restaurant, Shenanigans Irish Pub, every summer season from the time I turned fourteen until I was twenty and this restaurant relied heavily on the seasonal workers employed on the J-1 Exchange Visitor Visa. This story is inspired by my own friendships at home and my summers spent working and forming close bonds with J-1ers, some of which remain my close friends today. Their excitement about this project, as well as the support I’ve received from so many people back home, is truly what inspires me to push through every challenge of making this film and make it the absolute best it can be.</p><p>    This campaign is raising money for the budget of J-1. Filmmaking is expensive, especially for a college student, and especially when that college student needs to transport a cast and crew of over twenty people from New York City to her hometown in Maryland. Thanks to the generosity of my friends and family in Ocean City, we do not have to pay for accommodations or location fees, but there is still a lot more to be covered. The funds I raise in this campaign will allow me to pay for the hefty costs of transportation and meals for the cast and crew during our shoot, as well as the expenses of equipment rentals, box truck rental, and all art, wardrobe, hair, and makeup department purchases. Shooting in Ocean City is absolutely imperative to the vision of J-1 and integral to the story as well as a dream come true for me. Your contributions will help make that dream a reality. </p><p>    This is not an all-or-nothing campaign, so every part of this goal that we raise will go towards our production. Every contribution, no matter how big or how small, matters so much to me and my team.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> My name is Nick Rosario, I'm a jazz trombonist and composers. For over a decade, I have been living with the awareness of my own anxiety and depression. In the beginning of this time, I found myself believing I was alone in my struggles. Statistically, this is untrue,</p>
<p>According to the Center for Disease Control, “in 2016, 63,632 drug overdose deaths occurred in the United States, the age-adjusted rate of overdose deaths increased significantly by 21.5% from 2015 (16.3 (per 100,000) to 2016 (19.8 per 100,000)” and in that, on average,</p>
<p>Both of these statistics are preventable with the continuous effort to destigmatize and spread awareness of mental health issues. Luckily, with the advent of social media, we now live in a time where we can start to freely discuss mental health without intense fear of scrutiny.</p>
<p>Inspired by this new found open forum, I have written four pieces for Trombone. Saxophone, Piano, Bass and Drums. These pieces are designed to express the feelings associated with anxiety, depression, lashing out against your family and friends who you believe don't understand and challenging yourself to accept your own personal demons. </p>
<p>In between tracks, I will be speaking with a counselor on each of these subjects to make the concepts more concrete. Thereby allowing the audience member to absorb the information in a more concrete manner.</p>
<p>Art is a great way for someone to express a feeling they have trouble putting into words. This project is an example of a healthier alternative than drug abuse and self harm. The interviews give the audience an opportunity to start conversations they previously found taboo or even slightly uncomfortable. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have already acquired $1000 from grant funding, but this only pays for recording studio time. </p>
<p>I still need $3500 to pay for filming, editing, distribution, equipment rental and promotion. Not to mention I have some amazing musicians and filmmakers agreeing to work on this and I would like to pay them what they deserve to be paid. </p>
<p>Perks:</p>
<p>if you donate $10 you get a pre-release digital and physical copy of the music.</p>
<p>$25 will get a copy of the film and cd in advance of the official release.</p>
<p>$50 will get you a copy of the film and cd in advance and I will donate the film to school's health or music department starting with my hometown LA county and spreading to the rest of the country.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Recording will start in early May as this is the best time to book the recording space and when my selected musicians and engineers are most available. The interviews will be filmed a week or two after recording so the counselor can hear a fully mixed version (likely unmastered). This means the project won't be completed in time to submit to any film or music festivals. However, I am aiming for the launch of the film to be on youtube sometime in Fall 2019. It will be released in weekly segments at first in an attempt to create serial intrigue.</p>
<p>This also requires some personal baggage of mine to be made public. I can assure you in the process of making this project a reality, I have found myself to be an 'open book' when it comes to my experiences with mental health.</p>Lastly, I am not new to recording but I am new to filming.

<p>The easiest thing to do is spread the word!</p>
<p>Share share share! Discuss, discuss, discuss! </p>
<p>Something else you can do, if you are comfortable, is contact me with interview questions or any personal experiences you would like addressed in the film.

<div>        Music has the power to inspire. No matter the language being spoken, a song that is sung with joy, spreads happiness; a song that is sung with sadness, spreads empathy; a song that is sung with passion, spreads hope. Jay Denton, founder of Endure Studios, is setting out on a mission to bring hope to struggling communities around the world through the power of music. He will be traveling to parts of the globe where there has been conflict, where people have been afflicted by war, terror, and persecution. The first place visited will be Lebanon, a country that has allowed more than 1.2 million Syrian refugees to enter. However, despite this act of kindness by the Lebanese government, the Syrians’ living situations are often bleak at best, and their future is perpetually uncertain.</div>
<div> </div>
<p>        Jay will partner with refugee musicians and singers to create and professionally produce music, giving them a platform for their art. The songs they make will tell their stories and bring to life the hopes, dreams, loves, and plights of those that have experienced life under much darker circumstances than most people. While Jay may be the instigator, it is these musicians whose stories will be told. When all else fails, hope remains.</p>

<h3><u>Where the Money Goes</u></h3>
</div><div>
<p>        Jake is no stranger to filming overseas. He has shot documentaries on five continents. He has done so on shoestring budgets and minimal crew. So you can be assured that the money will be going to right places.</p>
<p>        We have four categories of expenses: Gear/Equipment (all film and travel gear), Travel (flights, buses, cars, documents), Living (food, accommodation), and Emergency (medical, insurance). The breakdown is as follows:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544547921/mpie33aao2lpammwuxh5.png"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Gear and Equipment</strong> - $3,000 - All film and travel-related supplies that we will need, including cameras, lenses, lights, tripods, etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Travel</strong> - $1,500 - Normally the most expensive thing about traveling abroad, however we were able to book relatively inexpensive flights and rental cars.</li>
<li>
<strong>Living</strong> - $3,000 - Accommodation and food are the big ones here, though a portion of this will be used as wages.</li>
<li>
<strong>Emergency</strong> - $1,000 - Weird stuff happens. There's always something unexpected that comes out of nowhere on a trip like this. Sometimes it's a good thing, sometimes it's food poisoning. Either way, we want to be prepared with medical supplies and insurance.</li>
</ul>
<p>        Our budget isn't the only place your money goes. It also goes to some GREAT perks, including <a href=""https://www.thegivingkeys.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Giving Keys</a>, and world rings, as well as posters, IMDb credit, executive producer status, hugs, a trip to the world premiere, and the ever-comforting feeling of putting good out into the world :)</p>

<h3><u>The Impact</u></h3>
<p>        I'm not sure this section of the campaign needs an explanation, but we should probably spell it out anyway:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refugees, child soldiers, survivors of genocide, these people have endured unfathomable pain and uncertainty in their lives which most of the rest of the world doesn't know about. Jay will give them a platform to voice their stories, hopes, dreams, and struggles in a way to which everyone can connect. This will not only produce some wonderful music, but give hope and opportunity to these victims.</li>
<li>And that's part two of the major goal here, to impact people who do not live in destabilized areas, to help them understand the humanity behind the tragedies that they glance over while reading or watching the news. It's a way to bridge the gap between cultures, religions, and world views.</li>
<li>Like Jay, we have a proven track record of delivering products that we promise. Jake has directed dozens of short documentaries from around the world, teaching people how to travel without breaking the bank and what to see, eat, and experience while you're there.</li>

<h3><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></h3>
<p>        The challenges are many. The whole point of Jay's project is that it is something difficult but important. All of the struggles that Jay will face, we will face as well.</p>
<ul>
<li>Language barriers could provide some issues, however we do have translators lined up for this first trip to Lebanon.</li>
<li>Though Lebanon is a relatively safe country, it does border Israel and Syria, which are areas of conflict.</li>
<li>Refugee camps have been labeled as unpredictable, but after talking with people who have spent years working in them it has been made clear that they are mostly very peaceful.</li>
<li>One of the most challenging aspects will be something that Jay will face alone, conveying the stories of these individuals through music. But that is what you're backing here- to see how this will unfold.</li>

</div></div>","Music has the power to inspire. No matter the language being spoken, a song that is sung with joy, spreads happiness; a song that is sung with sadness, spreads empathy; a song that is sung with passion, spreads hope. Jay Denton, founder of Endure Studios, is setting out on a mission to bring hope to struggling communities around the world through the power of music. He will be traveling to parts of the globe where there has been conflict, where people have been afflicted by war, terror, and persecution. The first place visited will be Lebanon, a country that has allowed more than 1.2 million Syrian refugees to enter. However, despite this act of kindness by the Lebanese government, the Syrians’ living situations are often bleak at best, and their future is perpetually uncertain.
 
        Jay will partner with refugee musicians and singers to create and professionally produce music, giving them a platform for their art. The songs they make will tell their stories and bring to life the hopes, dreams, loves, and plights of those that have experienced life under much darker circumstances than most people. While Jay may be the instigator, it is these musicians whose stories will be told. When all else fails, hope remains.
 
The Director
Jake Green

 

I have directed documentaries in 35+ countries.
I have never been more excited about a project than the one you are reading about right now.
You are what makes this whole thing work. Without you, I'm just a guy with a dream. I would be honored and humbled to receive your support and partnership in any way that you can give it.

 
The Instigator
Jay Denton

 

His skills are innumerable. He is a music producer, a singer/songwriter, a black belt Krav Maga instructor, a marathon runner, a business owner, and has been called ""Blonde Rambo"" by some who know him.
We believe he is the perfect person to take on a project like the one he has set forth and we plan to be there to document the entire thing.
We asked each interviewee what Jay's biggest weaknesses are. The worst thing that came out of it was that he can be too focused and passionate. Those really don't sound like weaknesses to us.

Here are Spotify links to some of the songs and albums produced by Jay and ENDURE Studios:
Locked - Album
Call My Own - Single
Fireworks - Single
Summer Again - Single
 
Where the Money Goes

        Jake is no stranger to filming overseas. He has shot documentaries on five continents. He has done so on shoestring budgets and minimal crew. So you can be assured that the money will be going to right places.
        We have four categories of expenses: Gear/Equipment (all film and travel gear), Travel (flights, buses, cars, documents), Living (food, accommodation), and Emergency (medical, insurance). The breakdown is as follows:



Gear and Equipment - $3,000 - All film and travel-related supplies that we will need, including cameras, lenses, lights, tripods, etc.

Travel - $1,500 - Normally the most expensive thing about traveling abroad, however we were able to book relatively inexpensive flights and rental cars.

Living - $3,000 - Accommodation and food are the big ones here, though a portion of this will be used as wages.

Emergency - $1,000 - Weird stuff happens. There's always something unexpected that comes out of nowhere on a trip like this. Sometimes it's a good thing, sometimes it's food poisoning. Either way, we want to be prepared with medical supplies and insurance.

        Our budget isn't the only place your money goes. It also goes to some GREAT perks, including Giving Keys, and world rings, as well as posters, IMDb credit, executive producer status, hugs, a trip to the world premiere, and the ever-comforting feeling of putting good out into the world :)

Though this was pretty much taking the mystery out of lots of films, it increased my interest in filmmaking because it all seemed so magical and so unbelievable that this was a real thing people did for a career. Now I’m about to start my final year in film school and over the past few years I’ve worked various roles on nearly 20 Film and TV projects. I’ve been lucky enough to have spent the majority of my time at Emerson working on sets, learning from mistakes and meeting talented people. My love for movies has grown immensely, and I still owe it to that book.</p>

<p>I've been making movies with my friends since I was in elementary school, but I didn't know it was something I wanted to do for the rest of my life until I went to the theater to see Guardians of the Galaxy. I was so purely entertained, I laughed and cried, and I realized eventually I wanted to inspire that same feeling in people. I'm so excited that I'm able to pursue that goal every day by working on bringing one-of-a-kind, entertaining projects like Bert Nondorf, Psychic to life. As a producer, I'll be working closely with Stefan every day to do just that, and gain valuable experience and knowledge along the way.</p>

<p>My two biggest passions are comedy and film, and being able to write and produce comedic films and TV at emerson has been a dream come true. As I enter my junior year, ive worked on a total of over 15 productions that take all shapes and sizes.

<p>I’m a producer on Bert and I’ve been making films since I was 11. But I didn’t get really into filmmaking until I made a short about Hurricane Sandy’s effect on my town. Making that little movie helped me realize the major emotional impact you can make through film, and I’ve been in love ever since. I’ve worked on two professional sets, the feature Low Tide and the show Impractical Jokers, as well as numerous Emerson student productions, and I can’t wait to get on set for Bert Nondorf! </p>

<p>After brief spells where I dreamed of going to space and driving a garbage truck, I found my passion for film at the movie Hanna. I was so enamored with how you could tell a story with where you put the camera and what you point it at and that fascination pushed me into filmmaking. I’ve been making movies since I was 13 and since arriving at Emerson as a transfer a year ago I’ve spent pretty much every weekend on one set or another. It’s never a boring time, and it’s a different job each week. I love getting to live a new life every time I work and that’s what draws me to film.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where is the money going?</h3>
<p>$6,000? What are they doing with that? Well, your donations are going to help us in a number of critical areas. These include <strong>production design</strong> - everything from a skunk puppet, stylized costumes, and props to make these character's homes look distinct to their personalities.</p>
<p>This will also cover <strong>locations</strong>. We want our film to have a small, suburban feel away from the bustle of the city. These characters live in their own world that feels slightly off from the one we live in. We'll be looking for home's that have that classic, lived in 1960's-feel.</p>
<p><strong>Equipment and crew transportation</strong> is a big one, since we have several locations to shoot in, many crew members and a whole slew of equipment to lug around. We'll need to rent a truck and use rideshare services to get to and from set.</p>
<p>Next up is <strong>food! </strong>We can't make a film on an empty stomach, can we? We want to make sure everyone is fed happily and healthily. </p>
<p>Another expense is <strong>festival distribution. </strong>We've put in lots of work during pre-production, and we can't wait to give it our all during shooting and post, so sending the final cut off to festivals for others to enjoy our hard work is a priority.</p>
<p>There are more expenses, but these were a few we wanted to highlight.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Takeaway.</h3>
<p>At the core of this project stands a team of students eager to learn the ins and outs of filmmaking from each other. None of us are required to do this and none of us are profiting from it either. We're all here because we believe in creating this project and want to gain experience doing so. The story we're working with is one that Stefan wrote his Sophomore year of college with the help of his friend Max Lichtenstein. They took a news headline involving a skunk and a psychic and let their imagination’s run wild. Now, we're making this unlikely story come to life and hope to entertain and inspire others to create stories of their own!</p>

Närmare bestämt $900 där 80% går till distribution i form av anmälningsavgifter till filmfestivaler och 20% går till att marknadsföra filmen.Därför behöver vi din hjälp för att kunna genomföra denna film! Vad Du FårVi har flera förmåner, eller perks som de heter här, som du kan få om du bidrar till Malt, Humle, Jäst & GÄRIS!Förmånerna är:

<h3>Hello!</h3>
<p>I'm Cameron Cox, a college student with a love and passion for fun, but thought-provoking stories set in futuristic, stylized worlds. </p>
<p>After four years of hard work, failure, and soul-searching, my team and I are not only confident that story-telling is our biggest strength and our calling, but that our ideas can offer something new to an industry riddled by remakes, reboots, and cookie-cutter ideas. <br/><br/>Films like <i><strong>""Children of Men""</strong></i>, <i><strong>""Arrival""</strong></i>, <strong><i>""The Invitation"", ""Terminator"" </i></strong>and video games like <strong><i>""Metal Gear Solid""</i></strong> and <strong><i>""Resident Evil""</i></strong>, are what inspire myself as a writer and director and have laid the groundwork for who I am as a creative. </p>
<p>But what really, truly inspires myself and my team us is our <strong><u>social and political climate.</u></strong></p>
<p>We live in a scary time in the world, where no matter what you believe, the answers to our world's problems only seem to sprout new ones in the process. We are confused, afraid, and lost. Some are even hopeless. If you don't feel this way, one must admit the world we thought we knew is changing into something we didn't ever expect.<b><i> </i></b></p>
<p><b><i><i>We believe the ambiguity surrounding the zombies in our story perfectly parallels the mystery of our world's future and the fears of the people, and this is why we've chosen zombies as opposed to aliens, or anything else. </i></i></b></p>
<p>This is the driving force behind<i><strong> ""Revelation""</strong></i>, and combined with my own writing and directorial touch, my producer's wit, and my director of photography's talent, our team is confident we can bring a fresh movie for audiences to enjoy, relate to, and be nourished and inspired by. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It is our belief that, while films can't be made without money, good, memorable, and inspiring stories are only as good as the script, the team producing it, and how that team utilizes the big (or small) pool of resources at their disposal. </p>
<p><u><strong><i>Thus, if we don't make our budget, all proceeds still contribute to the film's production and the project still moves forward. </i></strong></u></p>
<p>This is how important the project is to us. </p>
<p>No matter how much you donate, <b><i>all contributors will receive a copy of the film, original soundtrack, and a formal ""thank-you"" in the film's credits.</i></b></p>
<p>Those who donate between 15 and 200 dollars are eligible to <i><strong>also</strong></i> receive opportunities like <i><i><strong>running our behind-the-scenes snapchat during our shoot, gaining access to early screenings, receive props and costumes, have your business/artwork promoted in our shoot/social media pages, and even attend the premier. </strong></i></i></p>
<p>In some cases, larger donations will also receive the perks of lower tier rewards. For example, if you donate 150 dollars, you will receive Executive Producer Credit as the 125 dollar donation also entails. </p>
<p><i>(Contributors are responsible for their own transportation when attending the premier and are rewarded with on-set experiences.)</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By donating, you are helping us achieve more than the creation of a film. While this may be a sci-fi-zombie-drama (or whatever you'd like to call it), it's our hope that our characters, their story, and their struggles help audiences become more understanding, patient, and compassionate in our world that's overrun by hatred, blame, and an unwillingness to understand others. </p>
<p>While we love horror and fun movies, what we truly hope is to change the world for the better through our film, and by donating, that is what your contribution actually drives. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Creating a film is challenging in more ways than one. No amount of experience can prepare creators for every problem one may encounter on set. </p>
<p>From colleagues not meshing, to equipment failures, to bad weather, there is always something big or small to serve as a blockade in the road. This happens to Steven Spielberg, Quentin Tarantino, and even Christopher Nolan. </p>
<p>Filmmaking is about problem solving, and if we weren't confident that our team could overcome such challenges, then we wouldn't be launching this campaign to begin with. </p>
<p>There is also some beauty to this. Sometimes a light may fail, but it adds a very interesting aspect to the look of your film, or perhaps an actor drops out and you have to choose your second choice, but your second choice turns out to be better than who you originally chose. </p>
<p>We as creators have come to learn that everything happens for a reason, and so long as you keep an open mind, accidents and mishaps may actually make the final product better and more organic in a way that was completely unforeseen. </p>
<p>At the end of the day, anything worth doing in life will never be easy, and difficulty is never a reason to not try to achieve what you want. </p>

</div></div>","Hello!
I'm Cameron Cox, a college student with a love and passion for fun, but thought-provoking stories set in futuristic, stylized worlds. 
After four years of hard work, failure, and soul-searching, my team and I are not only confident that story-telling is our biggest strength and our calling, but that our ideas can offer something new to an industry riddled by remakes, reboots, and cookie-cutter ideas. Films like ""Children of Men"", ""Arrival"", ""The Invitation"", ""Terminator"" and video games like ""Metal Gear Solid"" and ""Resident Evil"", are what inspire myself as a writer and director and have laid the groundwork for who I am as a creative. 
But what really, truly inspires myself and my team us is our social and political climate.
We live in a scary time in the world, where no matter what you believe, the answers to our world's problems only seem to sprout new ones in the process. We are confused, afraid, and lost. Some are even hopeless. If you don't feel this way, one must admit the world we thought we knew is changing into something we didn't ever expect. 
We believe the ambiguity surrounding the zombies in our story perfectly parallels the mystery of our world's future and the fears of the people, and this is why we've chosen zombies as opposed to aliens, or anything else. 
This is the driving force behind ""Revelation"", and combined with my own writing and directorial touch, my producer's wit, and my director of photography's talent, our team is confident we can bring a fresh movie for audiences to enjoy, relate to, and be nourished and inspired by. 

What We Need & What You Get
It is our belief that, while films can't be made without money, good, memorable, and inspiring stories are only as good as the script, the team producing it, and how that team utilizes the big (or small) pool of resources at their disposal. 
Thus, if we don't make our budget, all proceeds still contribute to the film's production and the project still moves forward. 
This is how important the project is to us. 
No matter how much you donate, all contributors will receive a copy of the film, original soundtrack, and a formal ""thank-you"" in the film's credits.
Those who donate between 15 and 200 dollars are eligible to also receive opportunities like running our behind-the-scenes snapchat during our shoot, gaining access to early screenings, receive props and costumes, have your business/artwork promoted in our shoot/social media pages, and even attend the premier. 
In some cases, larger donations will also receive the perks of lower tier rewards. For example, if you donate 150 dollars, you will receive Executive Producer Credit as the 125 dollar donation also entails. 
(Contributors are responsible for their own transportation when attending the premier and are rewarded with on-set experiences.)

The Impact
By donating, you are helping us achieve more than the creation of a film. While this may be a sci-fi-zombie-drama (or whatever you'd like to call it), it's our hope that our characters, their story, and their struggles help audiences become more understanding, patient, and compassionate in our world that's overrun by hatred, blame, and an unwillingness to understand others. 
While we love horror and fun movies, what we truly hope is to change the world for the better through our film, and by donating, that is what your contribution actually drives. 

Risks & Challenges
Creating a film is challenging in more ways than one. No amount of experience can prepare creators for every problem one may encounter on set. 
From colleagues not meshing, to equipment failures, to bad weather, there is always something big or small to serve as a blockade in the road. This happens to Steven Spielberg, Quentin Tarantino, and even Christopher Nolan. 
Filmmaking is about problem solving, and if we weren't confident that our team could overcome such challenges, then we wouldn't be launching this campaign to begin with. 
There is also some beauty to this. Sometimes a light may fail, but it adds a very interesting aspect to the look of your film, or perhaps an actor drops out and you have to choose your second choice, but your second choice turns out to be better than who you originally chose. 
We as creators have come to learn that everything happens for a reason, and so long as you keep an open mind, accidents and mishaps may actually make the final product better and more organic in a way that was completely unforeseen. 
At the end of the day, anything worth doing in life will never be easy, and difficulty is never a reason to not try to achieve what you want. 

Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help.
Sharing this video to all your friends and family, and communicating our message and why we are making this film does more than one might think. 
If you find you don't have money to donate, but want to do more than share the video, donations in the form of food, transportation, old clothing, electrical equipment, or anything one might think is useful to a crew of workers on set (be it creative or technical) is also appreciated.

<p><strong>'The Humanity Trials'</strong> is a near future psychological drama short film. We intend to provoke conversation with this short film by delving into themes such as innocence, exploitation and injustice. Revolving around the question - Does innocence mean anything to a human race?</p>

<p><strong>The Humanity Trials</strong> is a psychological drama set in 2027, where the death penalty has been brought back to the UK. Three death-row prisoners who are awaiting their execution date have been forced to partake in a prohibited experiment <strong>'The Humanity Trials'.</strong> Dr. Bates, the head of this experiment, is investigating the prisoners to see if they show a lack of remorse for their crimes or express empathy for their victims. Throughout our film we see Azeal Carter (our protagonist) a wrongfully convicted engineer, suffering more than the other prisoners as he protests his innocence.</p>
<p>Within the time frame of 3 days we delve into the life of the inmates who are kept within a confined room, and stripped of their humanity.</p>
<p>For the first day of the trial, the three inmates wake up after having been drugged in an unknown environment. Unaware of their surroundings, they begin to question why they’re there. This leads to Azeal interrogating the other inmates, trying to piece together the situation.</p>
<p>On day two, the inmates are presented with projected images of their victims and the crime scenes they left behind. This provokes strong reactions from the three, which is all analysed by Dr. Bates.</p>
<p>On the last day, the prisoners face the final decision of choosing which one of the group should face execution immediately. This brings us to the hook of our story. Who will survive and how far would you go to save yourself?</p>

<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>We are absolutely overwhelmed with the love and support people have already shown for our campaign! We are busy constructing set and buying props this week, so the money is going a long way. In the meantime the team has been very busy trying to raise more money through bake-sales and sponsored photo-shoots. We've made £653 doing this and we've each been saving our own money to put towards this project. We have been working at our hardest to reach our goal, with 20 days left we still need all the help we can get. If you could share this with friends and family it would mean everything to us.</p>

Dave is given an ultimatum — 7 minutes to choose between <i>life</i> or <i>death</i>.</p>

<h3>Director / Cinematographer / Producer</h3>
<p><u><strong>Artem Zuev</strong></u><strong> </strong>was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia and moved to the United States at the age of 11. He discovered his passion for photography as a young boy while borrowing his grandfather's unloaded 35mm camera for the sole joy of being able to set focus and press the shutter. Artem studied International Relations and Cinematic Arts at the University of Southern California and graduated in 2008.</p>
<p>His real filmmaking school began in the cutting room with his mentor and legendary editor Alain Jakubowicz.

Our movie follows the journey of Dave (Daniel Lavid), a traumatized young man who is struggling to find his place in life, until one day at the apex of frustration and self-loathing, he loses everything, and faces Death (Mike Burstyn). The task of Death is to sell Dave on the idea that it would be in his greatest interest to sign a release form and give up on his life and existence. Dave is given an ultimatum — 7 minutes to choose between life or death.

Director / Cinematographer / Producer
Artem Zuev was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia and moved to the United States at the age of 11. He discovered his passion for photography as a young boy while borrowing his grandfather's unloaded 35mm camera for the sole joy of being able to set focus and press the shutter. Artem studied International Relations and Cinematic Arts at the University of Southern California and graduated in 2008.
His real filmmaking school began in the cutting room with his mentor and legendary editor Alain Jakubowicz. While pursuing his passion in cinematography and directing, Artem quickly understood that all facets of filmmaking are revealed in the cutting room. After several feature editing credits alongside Alain Jakubowicz, Artem got his first break as a cinematographer on Isaac Hertz’s documentary One Rock Three Religions, which won the 2015 International Jury Grand Prix at the Terra di Siena Film Festival, 2016 Impact DOCS Award, and has received a special screening at the U.S. Congress.

Schindler (film still /no color correction)Short Summary  Austrian-born and educated, R. M. Schindler(RMS) lived and worked in Los Angeles in the early twentieth century. He changed forever the architectural landscape of Los Angeles and laid the foundation for what now is considered California lifestyle of indoor-outdoor living, impacting world architecture as a whole for years to come and to this day. His life story is one of passion for art and architecture and one of emigration to foreign lands.Schindler's Studio at the Kings Road House, 1922  (film still /no color correctionThe house Schindler built for his family and another couple on Kings Road, West Hollywood in 1922, is now a museum: considered the first modern house built anywhere in the world. It was an architectural and social experiment, challenging the precepts of the nuclear family.  It marked the birth of counter culture in America, dealing with such issues as feminism, gender equality, communal living. It was a gathering place for artists, radicals and a cradle for modern architecture.The Kings Road House, 1922 arch. R.M. Schindler photo by Valentina B.Ganeva Schindler transformed the way we see space and how we use it. His architecture grew from inside-out directly responding to the lifestyle of its occupants; it elevated their everyday existence by bringing it into harmony with nature. A true original, Schindler, never succumbed to the trends of the day. He experimented and invented over a period of 30 years: suffering the ups and downs of a creative genius, forging his own vision.  R.M. Schindler and Prince, his shepherd dog at the Kings Road House, 1940s.What We Need & What You GetThe heavy lifting getting the film to its final stage has been accomplished. Where we now need your participation is with payments for :COLOR CORRECTION, MUSIC, SOUND DESIGN AND MIX, MOTION GRAPHICS and TITLE DESIGN, ARCHIVES, STOCK FOOTAGE & STILLS, ONLINE (conforming the edit in HI REZ), ACTORS FEES (narration & voice over), DELIVERABLES, WEBSITE DESIGN, PROMOTION and PUBLICITY, LEGAL FEES, getting the film into film festivals and ultimately getting it distributed. The How House, 1925 arch. R.M. Schindler  (film still /no color correction)Any money we raise above and beyond our goal will allow for enhanced post production, pre-release marketing and advance screenings of the film with after-party for everyone who has contributed. We gracefully acknowledge  R. M. Schindler Archive, Architecture & Design Collection. ADA Museum at University of California, Santa Barbara for giving  permission to make these limited edition prints as rewards for donations on this Crowdfunding campaign.Your support is vital to the success of this project and will give us the tools and resources we need to deliver an epic story that is inspiring, informative and entertaining. The How House, 1925 arch. R.M. Schindler  (film still /no color correction)THE IMPACTThe importance of this film has already been acknowledged in many ways: it has been supported and endorsed by Friends of Schindler House, Los Angeles; MAK Center for Arts and Architecture, Los Angeles; MAK Museum, Vienna; Schindler Archives, UCSB and a wide international artistic community.In 2017, the project won the Award from the Jury for Best New Documentary Project in the Accelerator Program at the South East European Film Festival in Los Angeles.A TEASER for the film is currently featured in the exhibition “Resident Alien: Austrian Architects in America” Sep. 25, 2019 - Feb. 17, 2020 held at the Austrian Cultural Forum in New York. Oliver House, 1933 arch. R.M. Schindler (photograph by Valentina B. Ganeva) In a digital era, Schindler's view of architecture as a cultural product is more relevant than ever. His breakthrough ideas advocated a culture of design innovation, encouraging experimentation and risk-taking, while preserving the environment -  a prescient vision all the more critical today.Although Schindler’s contribution to Modern Architecture is well-known among architects, he and his notable work are less familiar to the general public. My intent is to change that.This film will play well at museums, cultural and art institutions, universities, libraries and homes around the world. It will provide artistic programming. It will advance cultural dialogue. Andrew Romano, owner of  the Walker House, 1936 arch. R.M. Schindler  (film still /no color correction)Your contribution will bring forth not only essential funds to complete the film, but will have a great impact as an endorsement and provide moral support. For the last two years I have been working on this project using my own limited resources, determined to see it to its rightful end. Making an independent documentary is very rewarding, but just like bringing up a child, it takes a village.I trust you'll see the merit of this project and the tremendous amount of work and dedication that have gone into it and thoughtfully consider lending your support.The Van Dekker House, 1940 arch.

R.M. Schindler  (film still /no color correction)Artistic ApproachThe film follows Schindler’s journey from Vienna through Chicago and on to Los Angeles, observing where possible through  his own camera lens and in his own words. His story is told through narration, interviews, correspondence, drawings, plans and photos. Schindler’s theoretical writings form the core of the film in order to explain his philosophy. Actors narrate the voices of R.M. Schindler, Frank Lloyd Wright, Richard Neutra, Ester McCoy, Ellen Janson to name a few.Featured in the film are 24 interviews with architects, architectural historians, members of the Schindler family, owners of Schindler designed houses. Most notable among the interviewed are: Frank Gehry, Thom Mayne, Wolf Prix, Steven Holl, Ray Kappe, Mark Mack, prof. Judith Sheine, prof. August Sarnitz, prof. Thomas Hines, Christoph Thun-Hohenstein, Director MAK Museum in Vienna and Robert Sweeney, Director Friends of Schindler House in Los Angeles.Professor August Sarnitz and director/producer Valentina B. Ganeva  with the Austrian crew on location at the Academy of Fine Arts in Vienna.We have already filmed many locations in Vienna, Chicago and Los Angeles. A key intent of this film is to show how Schindlerʼs master works have stood the test of the time.  Featured in the film are 20 buildings designed by R.M. Schindler as well as several designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and Richard Neutra.Schindler left over 500 photos he took himself during his stay in Chicago (1914-1920), Taos (1915), Taliesin (1919), Yosemite and Los Angeles (1920s). We've made extensive use of this material, some never before made public. Schindler's correspondence with his lover Ellen Janson, currently held in private collection will be revealed for the first time as well.The Kallis House, 1946 arch. R.M. Schindler  (film still /no color correction)We have also unearthed interviews with Pauline Schindler at the Kings Road House from 1976, home movies of the Neutras at the Kings Road House from 1925, footage of the Tischler House and the Kallis House from 1950's and the only existing film footage of R.M. Schindler at the Kings Road House from the late 1940's.The complexity of Schindler’s spaces made them very challenging to photograph.  The principal Director of Photography, Jacek Laskus, ASC used elaborate dolly moves and state of the art lighting to capture the mood of Schindler’s spaces. All of Schindler’s architecture was shot with ALEXA camera and PRIME lenses, allowing for extensive color correction.Pueblo Ribera Court, 1923 arch. R. M. Schindler (film still /no color correctioThere was scant archival footage of Schindler or his buildings. In order to achieve a seamless flow between the archival elements and new documentation, we created transitions to look as if they were from the time using a vintage Bolex. All Super 8 and 16mm film was shot by the award-winning Director of Photography, Danny Ducovny.Now we are in the crucial phase of casting the voice of Schindler himself. Someone who captures the spirit of the man. My first choice is the great fellow-Austrian artist, Mr. Christoph Waltz to narrate the voice of R.M. Schindler. We are looking for ways to make that happen.
Rodriguez House, 1942 arch. R.M. Schindler. (film still /no color correction)
Schindler taught us to be resourceful, to turn challenges into opportunities, to follow our own voice. His struggles and creative message are timeless. It is my heartfelt conviction that a thorough exploration of his life and work will greatly benefit the world at large.
This project is my way of giving back, it is a community's love for treasured historical landmarks and a tribute to a man before his time who was a rebel and a true original.

Their impact is immeasurable. As we embark on 2020, the bicentennial year of the birth of Florence Nightingale, who is considered the mother of modern nursing, we are taking the bold step of bringing nursing’s story into the spotlight on the international stage, with a feature film and transmedia campaign called Legacy of Light. We take this step with the support of countless Nursing Organizations and nurses around the world including:      • International Council of Nurses     • Commonwealth Nurses and Midwives Federation     • Florence Nightingale Foundation, London, UK     • Florence Nightingale Museum, London, UK     • American Academy of Nursing     • American Nurses Association     • Florida Atlantic University School of Nursing     • International Nurse Coach Association     • Nightingale Initiative for Global Health     • Rutgers University School of Nursing     • University of Massachusetts Worcester Graduate School of Nursing     • University of Virginia School of Nursing     • Watson Caring Science Institute     • many others now in progressA powerful script written by Nurse Researchers and Nightingale Scholars, Barbara Dossey, PhD, RN, FAAN, and Deva-Marie Beck, PhD, RN, Legacy of Light tells the story of the dynamic, trailblazing nursing pioneer, Florence Nightingale, and her continuing impact on the world. The film is currently in development, and has attracted the interest of “A”-list acting and directing talent. The profession of nursing and the life story of Florence Nightingale deserve nothing less!Our PlanFeature FilmThe plan is to premiere the Legacy of Light movie during 2020, the bicentennial of Nightingale’s birth. Our objective is to reach the 3.4 million nurses in the US and the estimated 22 million nurses and midwives who globally carry the light of healing into the 21st century and advocate for health as a basic human right. As well, we seek to reach those who are considering nursing as a profession. We further want to reach those whose encounter with a nurse has touched their lives. Strategically, we need your help to reach a global audience ready to welcome this true story of an historic feminine leader, visionary, and social change-maker.Transmedia CampaignAn ambitious transmedia campaign for Legacy of Light is also in preparation to ensure worldwide access to the film and create opportunities for deepening the awareness and experience of audiences. This includes developing educational opportunities that flow from the material.  We are planning to integrate a far-reaching, multi-language commitment to our “Nightingale Declaration for A Healthy World,” as well as developing learning opportunities for K-12 and a broad range of media, events and interactive activities for North American and worldwide audiences. A TV Series, “Light Beyond Borders” is also being developed to complement the feature film —bringing the spirit and legacy of Florence Nightingale into the 21st century with nurses featured on the frontlines of health challenges across the globe.Expanding and Supporting NIGHAll current contributions will assist the promotion, production, distribution and versioning of the independent feature film ‘Legacy of Light.’  All revenue—beyond these film production and promotion costs—will sustain the further initiatives of the Nightingale Initiative for Global Health (NIGH). Meet the NURSES who wrote the Legacy of Light Screenplay and are leading this charge!

 
The force behind this vision — that is quickly becoming a reality — is the work of two nurse researchers/scholars who have devoted decades exploring the life of Florence Nightingale.  They have spent years developing this screenplay, which is based on the award-winning book Florence Nightingale: Mystic, Visionary, Healer by Dr. Dossey. They have both devoted endless energy to promote both the practice and the future of nursing. 
Together they founded the Nightingale Initiative for Global Health (NIGH), a grassroots, nurse-inspired movement to increase global concern for and commitment to human health. In 'Special Consultative Status' with the United Nations Economic & Social Council, NIGH’s Mission is to engage the common values and wisdom of millions of nurses, midwives and concerned citizens, and to act as a catalyst for the transformation of individuals, communities and society for the achievement of a healthy world. Founded in 2004, NIGH has a history of successful initiatives which include the Nightingale Declaration for a Healthy World; At the Heart of It All; Daring, Caring & Sharing to Save Mothers' Lives and co-founding the 2010 International Year of the Nurse / Nightingale Centennial. This Legacy of Light Feature Film & Transmedia Campaign is NIGH's newest project.  Barbara Dossey, PhD, RN, AHN-BC, FAAN, HWNC-BC / Screenwriter Dr. Dossey is a leading Florence Nightingale scholar and the world’s only nurse biographer of Nightingale. With meticulous scholarship, Dr. Dossey’s award-winning Florence Nightingale: Mystic, Visionary, Healer (2010) documents the struggles and achievements of a woman who defied the conventions and standards of Victorian England to blaze her own path. Dr. Dossey’s scholarship in crafting this illustrated biography includes numerous archival photographs, drawings, letters, maps, and a riveting narrative that creates a portrait of this complex, larger-than-life woman who lived for 90 years and is still a source of inspiration today. Dr. Dossey serves as an International Co-Director, of the Nightingale Initiative for Global Health (NIGH), and is co-author of the award-winning textbook Florence Nightingale Today: Healing, Leadership, Global Action (2005). She has been the guest editor of a number of nursing journals and author of many articles, chapters and books, all revealing her in-depth study and complex analysis of Nightingale’s life and work. Her collaborative global nursing project — NIGH— and the Nightingale Declaration Campaign (NDC) have been developed to strengthen individual commitment toward achieving a healthy world as a priority objective for action by ordinary citizens, by civil society organizations and by all governments, local and national. Dr. Dossey is a Fellow of the American Academy of Nursing (FAAN), Co-Director of the International Nurse Coach Association and is certified in Holistic Nursing (AHN-BC) and Health & Wellness Nurse Coaching (HWNC-BC). She is an 12-time recipient of the prestigious American Journal of Nursing Book of the Year Award and has received  many awards during her remarkable, prolific career — including: Visionary Award by the Academy of Integrative Health and Medicine, Pioneer of Integrative Medicine Award from the Aspen Center for Integrative Health, the Distinguished Alumni Award from Baylor University, TWU 100 Great Nursing Alumni from Texas Woman's University and Holistic Nurse of the Year from the American Holistic Nurses' Association.Deva-Marie Beck, PhD, RN / ScreenwriterDr. Beck is a Nightingale scholar, multi-media specialist, author and educator — serving, in all these roles — as an International Co-Director of NIGH, the Nightingale Initiative for Global Health. She has developed numerous multi-media approaches to inform a growing audience concerned with global health. These include online feature articles, videos and photo-essays — coordinating with nurses and media professionals globally. In 2014, she was commissioned by the WHO Health Workforce Department to create 'At the Heart of It All: Nurses & Midwives for Universal Health Coverage’ — premiered at the WHO Global Forum for Chief Nursing/Midwifery Officers in Geneva and featured many times since at WHO conferences regionally and worldwide. In 2008, she  collaborated with WHO and a global array of nursing leaders to co produce a video for WHO’s 60th anniversary — ‘Nurses & Midwives: Now More Than Ever for a Healthy World’ in eight language versions.Dr. Beck also oversees the development of NIGH’s team of NGO Representatives to the United Nations. She is co-author of the award-winning Florence Nightingale Today: Healing, Leadership, Global Action and has since written many related articles and textbook chapters to pioneer a broader understanding of Nightingale’s relevance to the 21st century — most recently ‘A Brief History of the United Nations and Nursing: A Healthy World Is Our Common Future,’ in the textbook ‘A New Era in Global Health: Nursing & The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.’ In addition to her doctoral work in Nursing History & International Development Education, she holds undergraduate degrees in Nursing, Health Sciences and Theatre Arts.What We Need and How You Can HelpAs of this writing, we have verbal commitment for the film’s $15 million production budget. The details are being finalized and we will post updates as progress is made.Where we need your participations is in helping fund the creation and launch of the transmedia campaign that will help us reach and educate a worldwide audience (see description under the Plan section). We have set a target of $250,000 to help support the enormous amount of work around the film and the creation and launch of the transmedia campaign. While this is significantly smaller than the typical Hollywood budget for worldwide promotion of an important film, it will give us a strong position for a powerful and impactful launch — and, as nurses, we know how to get things done!This funding will be used to:
Launch and maintain a worldwide social media campaign
Develop and launch a worldwide marketing campaign

Support speeches and events that promote this work
Help fund the resources needed to reach audiences across the globe:

Social Media Coordinator
Digital and Graphics support
Communications Coordinator
Strategic Partners Coordinator
Legal and Expert Counsel


We believe that — with the support of as little as $1.00 from nurses and $5.00 from those who appreciate what a nurse has done for them — our goal is achievable. We plan to expand coordination with nursing organizations, global health organizations, like-minded nonprofits, nursing colleges and universities, foundations, as well as pharmaceutical and healthcare companies — to bring in sponsorships at the same time.

By engaging audiences everywhere, we are sharing the critical role of nurses throughout the world and are advocating global health worldwide.The story of Florence Nightingale is a powerful example of the positive impact single individuals can have in meeting the urgent issues of global health.  By bringing broad exposure to the inspiring story of Florence Nightingale, we celebrate her as a nurse, a visionary, an agent of change, and hero to so many, while opening up the potential to inspire others to make a difference, whether small or large.“If we can transform—by a few years of persistent effort—the habits of centuries, our progress will not have been slow but amazingly rapid!”   Florence Nightingale“Health is not only to be well—but to use well—every power we have to use.”   Florence NightingaleOur Track RecordWe are very fortunate to have gathered an extraordinary team and group of advisors, all of whom have extensive, successful track records on both the national and international stage.

He was a strategic contributor to the UN General Assembly's unanimous 1969 Resolution for Mobilization of Global Public Opinion and the adoption, in 1970, for this related 2nd Development Decade.  In 1971, as Director of the European Office for the UN Centre for Economic & Social Information (CESI), based in Geneva, he worked with all Agencies and Organizations of the UN System to advance the multi-media strategy for this 'Decade.' He also served as the founding Director of Communications for the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in Nairobi. Mr. Kines began a professional mass-media career as a journalist at age 15, serving as ‘District Correspondent’ in rural western Manitoba for the Winnipeg Free Press. In the six decades since, he has traveled the world — in many professional communications and strategic roles, including at the United Nations — seeking to share the ideas and information he considers essential for human progress.From all of these vantages, Mr. Kines has voluntarily served the founding and development of the Nightingale Initiative for Global Health (NIGH) — overseeing the communications and media strategies worldwide. With NIGH’s Founding Board in 2004 — he crafted NIGH’s first foundational document the ‘Nightingale Declaration for A Healthy World’ — beginning with a phrase modeled after the original UN Charter — “We the nurses and concerned citizens hereby dedicate ourselves to achieve a healthy world.” Launched on NIGH’s original website, this Declaration has since achieved 25,000 individual signanatories — officially representing organizations of millions, from 106 nations. Across the years, he has guided NIGH’s growing grassroots-to-global teams to mobilize global public opinion to achieve the UN Millennium Development Goals, to participate in the UN Post-2015 Agenda in New York and to champion public opinion to achieve the UN Sustainable Development Goals — guiding NIGH toward its top-NGO achievement of UN ECOSOC ‘Special Consultative Status’ in 2018 — to gather grassroots knowledge about the UN SDGs to share at global levels.Our AdvisorsJudith Shamian is the past President and President Emerita of the International Council of Nurses (2013 to 2017), a federation of more than 130 national nurses’ associations representing more than 20 million nurses worldwide.

A Registered Nurse since 1985, Ursula began her career in cardiology, general medicine, cancer care and research. In 1999, she was appointed Director of Nursing and Midwifery of the Portsmouth Hospitals NHS Trust. During her twelve years as Chief Executive there, she led a complex change agenda toward a significant reconfiguration of services across three hospitals — culminating in a new hospital funded by a Private Finance Initiative.  Dave Green is the Director of the Florence Nightingale Museum in London, UK, joining that team in July 2017. His previous work experience involves roles in education, marketing and business development, working for heritage organizations including Nottingham Castle, The Natural History Museum and The National Trust.  Dave was inspired to join the Florence Nightingale Museum as he is excited by the opportunities of working with one of the most famous names in British history, particularly preparing for Nightingale’s 2020 Bi-centenary, exploring the many contemporary links to her substantial achievements, and embedding the Museum further in its local community and the London tourist market.Risks & ChallengesNurses get things done, they just do. With the strength of nursing leadership and nursing communities across the globe in support of this project, there is very little risk that this vision won’t be achieved. The nurse leaders and film industry professionals who are overseeing this project have a wealth of successful initiatives and vast networks to see this vision through.Time is probably our biggest challenge. Ideally we would like to premiere this film on or around May 12, 2020 — the bicentennial of Nightingale’s birth. This is possible if many things align and we are holding this intention.",18.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Production</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We are looking to raise an additional $10,000 to complete the funding for this project. We have already raised some investor funds for this low budget film. <i>Please be advised;</i> don't let the words low budget fool you into thinking this project will be low quality. Movies now exist in a time where award-winning films are being shot on consumer cell phones, proving that low budgets can still yield an amazing quality of production.</p>
<p>Our goal is to be able to provide <strong>paid</strong> jobs for local talent and crew throughout northeast Ohio. The funds will also be used for some equipment purchases, securing locations, wardrobe, props screening and marketing efforts. </p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p><i>Dr. Abigail Williams is a Forensic Psychologist who becomes selfishly excited when the case of the City vs. Hettie Dallman lands on her plate.  Hettie Dallman is on trial for brutally murdering both of her parents. She has barely spoken a word since it has all happened. This is the case that Abby has been waiting for.  She dives headstrong into the case, neglecting her husband and causing deep splinters in their already struggling marriage.</i></p>
<p><i>As Abby digs deeper into Hettie’s past, she ends up unlocking disturbing secrets in her own. It’s not long before she realizes she may be dealing with more than what she bargained for.</i></p>
<p><i>This is a story about family denial. This film examines what happens to a person who has been abused as a child and then forced to pretend it didn’t happen. What does that do to the person’s self-esteem? What type of person does this create? How does a person cope with what has happened to them when they are never allowed to acknowledge it? How do they live with the hurt and self-blame?  </i></p>
<p><i>It’s about family secrets and hidden shame that everyone knows about, but no one dare talk about. It doesn’t just go away it festers and simmers just below the surface. The hurt becomes anger, the anger, hate and in Hettie’s case revenge.</i> </p>
<p>Hush is a gritty family drama that exposes the pain and shame of denial and abuse. It's a challenging topic, but we feel it's necessary to bring a story like this to the audience.  Most likely, you or someone you know has gone through the struggles outlined in this story. You will be entertained, educated and definitely not the same once you experience this emotional tale.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The producers are aware that there all always risks involved with producing a feature film. However, we believe in the story and it's impact on our audience. The producers used their own personal finances to create the concept trailer for the film <i>(seen above)</i> in order to give an idea of the feel and dynamic of the movie (and that's just the first scene!).  These two women have already overcome many challenges and obstacles for this films' production. They have been working on this project since 2012 and now, they are closer to the finish line than ever before and the final funding will help them cross into production by the fall of 2018. One of producer Tamiko's favorite lines is <i>""Teamwork makes the dream work!"" </i>We have a great team and we believe it's time for our dream to come into fruition.</p>

<h3>Short Film ""Jeff""</h3>
<p>Jeff pays a visit to his mother to celebrate the birthday of his father, who had passed one year earlier. During this special visit, he also plans to reveal his true sexual orientation to his mother despite his fear of the possibility of his mother disowning him.</p>
<p>Will Jeff finally be able to tell his mother? Will she accept him? This film is based on a true coming out story and explores the idea of ""being true to yourself"" versus ""family expectations"" in the Asian community. </p>
<h3><strong>Why Is It Important?</strong></h3>
<p>The coming out process has been quite difficult for many of my Asian American friends in the LGBT community. Some of them contemplated not coming out at all because they didn't want to disappoint their family and they had to live up to certain expectations. I wanted to make this film which focuses on their struggles and their complex emotions formed by expectations, family upbringing, and the community.</p>
<h3>How Your Donation Will Be Used</h3>
<p><strong>Crew ($1000)</strong></p>
<p>Our filmmakers are all professionals. Great techniques and skills always come with the cost. In order to make this film perfect, we need to gather the best filmmakers we could get.</p>

<p><strong>Food ($300)</strong></p>

<h2><u>Story of Film </u></h2>
<p>A young woman, Valerie, was kidnapped as a child by a pagan witch who attempted to perform a ritual on her in preparation to eat her. However, Valerie escaped and returned to her family. Now fifteen years later, after moving away, returns to her birth town of Mikulov, CZ to visit her estranged Uncle after her parents have died. Although while on her way there she meets her former kidnapper, the witch Julia,  but Valerie doesn't know that it is her. This also triggers strange cannibalistic thoughts within Valerie and she struggles to understand why the thoughts are happening.  So now Julia's goal becomes to lure Valerie into her clutches and finish the job she started all those years ago!</p>

<p>Utilizing painted sets to bring the world of FAUVE FOREST to life, we aim to expand our developing skill sets to produce a fantastical LGBT short film full of colour, life and mystery.

<p>To create FAUVE FOREST and make it come to life, we rely on generous crowdfunders.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We are looking to raise money for our short film ""Godfrey's Light.""</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">In a time where the exposure of racism and historical injustice have brought many to debate and deny, our film begs the question what happens when we are forced to answer to the source of our existence. The film focuses on the concept that we all originated from stardust. We will explore this concept by showing how even though humanity has evolved into human forms, the remnants of who we used to be remain within us. We all come from the same place and are composed of the same particles that didn’t initially have a moral compass to impact the universe, but we have since evolved into more complicated beings. In the film, the characters live in a world where executions of criminals are televised events, complicit in a society that publicizes an immoral code of justice. What happens when that original stardust returns to show all of them who they really are?  </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We feel Godfrey’s Light is a film that needs to be made now since the Black Lives Matter movement has shed light on the numerous accounts of police brutality and unfair treatment of African Americans.

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">South Carolina has a longstanding connection to this affliction such as events like the execution in 1939 of George Stinney, an African American child who was denied the right to a fair trial.

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">It is our hope that Godfrey’s Light will give a voice to those that feel overlooked and reassure that representation of African American characters in film matters and are needed now more than ever. </p>

<p>Doctor Peter Chojnowski has a doctorate from Fordham University in NYC. He has taught at 8 institutions of higher learning and has written and lectured around the world concerning the apparitions at Fatima. After finding anomalies in the photographic evidence, he established a non-profit organization to identify and research the actual historical life of Sister Lucy dos Santos of Fatima.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Sandy De Lisle, lead writer and executive producer of You're OUT!—a comedy feature film that portrays youth sports in all their glory—and excessiveness. As a mom who raised two travel baseball players, I've spent a lot of time watching kids play ball. And after hundreds of hours of observing from the bleachers, I can definitely say this: Youth sports are wacked!</p>
<p>It's not like when I grew up, and kids played multiple sports through high school. Now it's all about choosing one sport by middle school and specializing. For baseball, that means private hitting, pitching, and catching lessons, $200 bats, cross-country travel-team road trips, and the penultimate experience: the college baseball showcase! </p>
<p>As a writer, I started wondering, ""How far would a parent go to get their kid recruited by a D-1 college baseball team?"" I reached out to my friend Rick Herrejon (who's in the process of raising a travel baseball kid), and we came up with the concept for the film:  A dad so obsessed with his son playing in the Majors that he loses his job and completely ignores the needs of his wife and daughter.</p>
<p>The film tips its hat to classic 80s movies and filmmakers like National Lampoon's Vacation and John Hughes: It's a good old-fashioned father-son road trip with a modern-day twist. Plus, because I'm all about rescuing dogs, we added a dog hero who's representing for all dogs labeled as ""pit bulls.""</p>
<p><strong>By contributing to our film you will:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Make people laugh (Not just ""tee hee."" We're talking lose-control-of-bodily-function guffaws.)</li>
<li>Help get Chicago creatives back to work (It's been a long freakin' year.)</li>
<li>Normalize ALL types of dogs as having the potential to be family pets</li>

<p>Our total budget is $250,000. That's the equivalent of one of Diana Prince's hair scrunchies in <i>Wonder Woman 1984</i>.  We're keeping <i>our</i> costs low by avoiding magic lassos and staying local—we only make it <i>look</i> like a road trip to Arizona. Thank you, green screens!</p>
<p>Plus, since we're so sure this film is going to sell (we already have a distributor, <a href=""https://glasshousedistribution.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Glass House</a>), our partners Ladie K Productions and Paper Star Video have agreed to film equity as partial compensation.</p>
<p>Our crowdfunding campaign is seeking $56,000 to cover our initial costs. Why $56K instead of $250K? Because 56 is former Chicago White Sox World Series pitcher Mark Buehrle's number, and he loves dogs.   </p>
<p>Seriously, though, we didn't want to overwhelm you. $250K is a lot of baseball bats. We figure $56K is enough to get us through the first phase of the project. And, hey, people kept contributing to Super Trooper 2's Indiegogo campaign after they met their goal. In fact, by promising an additional car chase scene, Super Troopers 2 (ST2) exceeded their goal by $2 million. Now, as much as we love ST2, $2 million is Hollywood pricing. If you all 9th-inning rally behind us,  we'll add a car chase scene too. Only we'll do it for a mere $300K over our goal. Now that's Midwestern values right there.</p>
<p><strong>Here's a breakdown of our budget:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cast–$50,000</strong></li>
<li><strong>Post-Production–$100,000</strong></li>
<li><strong>Production Crew–$50,000</strong></li>
<li><strong>Legal &amp; Insurance–$25,000</strong></li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi. I’m writer and producer Jerry Thompson. I really think we've got a real gem in this proposed film project. I even feel a ""calling"" to make this happen! After writing, producing and directing a feature film in 2018 that was approved for a national theatrical distribution, I am even more excited about this new project!</p>
<p>I am the writer and producer of the Native American feature film “BRIGHT EYES” (approx. 2 hours).  It’s the true story of a shy, young woman of the Omaha Tribe whose love for her people and other Native Americans helped her overcome her fear. So, she spoke out against injustice and helped bring about the landmark court case of Chief Standing Bear vs. General George Crook where a Native American was first regarded as a “person” with legal rights!</p>
<p>I first heard about Bright Eyes when I was a publicity person for the Native film ""Windwalker. "" My passion is that this film will not just be “based on a true story”, but unlike in other big films about real people, everything will be true and authentic…no exaggerations or false events.</p>
<p>What also attracted me to this story is that even though many of the white people were bad, Bright Eyes and Standing Bear received a lot of help from good whites….it’s a story where red and white people unite to fight injustice.  I see it as “Dances with Wolves” meets “Amistad.”</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be great to see the Kickstarter record be broken with the true Native American story with the hero being a woman? We have set our goal at $6 million…that's 300,000 people giving $20 and they will receive a reward too! We all can make it happen!!</p>
<p>Here's a small part of a speech that Bright Eyes actually gave in New York in 1880 which reveals her heart:</p>
<p><strong>""Today Standing Bear has nothing but his blanket and has left his wife and family out on the plains while he comes to you for help. It seems to us at times that the great Government treats us more like dogs than human beings. I believe, however, that we are God’s people, and He will not desert us. It brings Christ nearer to my heart to think that he suffered so when he was on earth. Please believe that we are human beings, and that we can love and hate just as you do</strong>.”</p>
<p>""How can we help but be degraded and savage under such a system? I only wonder that any spark of manhood and self-respect has remained in any of my people. Yet I have seen my race as noble men and women as any I have ever seen among your people, or read of in your histories. But, when I began this letter, I did not intend to be led off in this strain, but some of the bitterness would creep out, and perhaps, it is just as well, for I know there are those among you who can understand and sympathize with my feelings.""</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The foundation has been laid to begin the “Bright Eyes” movie, but Pathway Films is now seeking the needed funding in order to start filming. </p>
<p>While we would not turn down individual investors, the beauty of crowd funding on Indiegogo is the grass roots nature of this. Every person who pledges money receives a t-shirt, posters, DVDs, and other rewards. For higher level pledges a role as an extra, tickets to the premieres, or even renting a theater for an exclusive showing with selected guests is available. When the goal is reached and the movie is released for national and international distribution, at least 50% of the profits will go to current pressing Native American needs.The Indiegogo goal for “Bright Eyes” is $6 million. The current crowd funding record is $5.7 million set in 2013 with the movie “Veronica Mars” in 2013.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe the true story of a young minority woman, her fight for justice, and how she helped make this world a better place is very timely and inspirational. We think “Bright Eyes” will attract not only a large Native audience, but audiences of all ethnicities and ages since it is also a story of how both whites and Natives joined forces to bring justice to Native Americans. We just hope that many thousands will catch the “Bright Eyes” vision and make their Indiegogo pledge so this movie can be made this year.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Hello, my name is Terance Mcleod and I'm the owner and Director of Film Jocks . We are an award winning  film company with monumental aspirations. Originally from South Florida we now reside in Atlanta. Georgia. Our  objective is to produce high quality content regardless of he film type.</li>
<li><p>This particular  film is an uptempo, fast paced and electric documentary telling a factual story of how football in Broward County has become such a dominant force in the game of football. The storyline details how a particular geographical area produces more professional athletes per capita than any other state in America. This film will also highlight the unmatched determination of our youth, which leads to conquering larger obstacles when dealing with life’s challenges. Finally, the film will feature interviews from current and former NFL greats and capture important aspects of history dating back to the 1960’s. </p></li>
<li>Having this project backed by you guy will allow us to complete this legendary project and produce it a a high level as we are well prepared to do. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>The initial budget for this film is estimated at $52,000. However, we are seeking assistance in reaching a goal of $45,000. Production has already begun with one completed session filmed February 19th and February 20th 2021. Six sessions and 12 days of filming remain. Film session cost are estimated at $2,700 per day, which extends the remaining production balance to $32,400. </li>
<li>Our sponsorship perks are really cool for our potential supporters. We invite you to take a peek at our tier levels to see which one fits you the best.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul><li>South Florida is long overdue in receiving its justification as simply the best on the national level. People all over the world have been wondering for years how a single Tri-County area, Palm Beach, Broward and Dade can consistently produce such massive amounts of talent year in and year out with no drop off in sight. This truly is a story that needs to be told and we are here to tell it. </li></ul>

This particular  film is an uptempo, fast paced and electric documentary telling a factual story of how football in Broward County has become such a dominant force in the game of football. The storyline details how a particular geographical area produces more professional athletes per capita than any other state in America. This film will also highlight the unmatched determination of our youth, which leads to conquering larger obstacles when dealing with life’s challenges. Finally, the film will feature interviews from current and former NFL greats and capture important aspects of history dating back to the 1960’s. 
Having this project backed by you guy will allow us to complete this legendary project and produce it a a high level as we are well prepared to do. 

 

What We Need & What You Get

The initial budget for this film is estimated at $52,000. However, we are seeking assistance in reaching a goal of $45,000. Production has already begun with one completed session filmed February 19th and February 20th 2021. Six sessions and 12 days of filming remain. Film session cost are estimated at $2,700 per day, which extends the remaining production balance to $32,400. 
Our sponsorship perks are really cool for our potential supporters. We invite you to take a peek at our tier levels to see which one fits you the best.


The Impact
South Florida is long overdue in receiving its justification as simply the best on the national level. People all over the world have been wondering for years how a single Tri-County area, Palm Beach, Broward and Dade can consistently produce such massive amounts of talent year in and year out with no drop off in sight. This truly is a story that needs to be told and we are here to tell it. 
Risks & Challenges
As we all know, lives have been forever turned upside down by the deadly Covid-19 pandemic. Some of the interviews and action scenes will pose significant issues for our film crew. 
Film Jocks follows strict Covid-19 guidelines as issued by the CDC and with your help will be more than prepared to handle any adverse circumstances while filming. We always conform by properly wearing masks, using hand sanitizer, washing our hands and keeping safe distances while on set.

<p>PROJECT SYNOPSIS</p>
<p>“Is This A Date?” is a romantic comedy . The story follows a socially awkward man named Jeffrey who goes out for dinner with the new hottie in the office known as Dave. However during the dinner, Jeffrey begins to wonder whether or not this is a date, or if it’s just two coworkers grabbing dinner. Jeffrey then turns to the waiter (Connor) for advice on what to do, for Dave has given him mixed signals in the past. Connor simply tells him “pay attention to the signs” that Dave puts out. As the night progresses we learn that Dave is actually straight, but the signs in Jeffrey’s head say otherwise. A hilarious night of events, take place as Jeffrey misinterprets Dave’s friendliness for provocative advances.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563167638/szc5lj0g91utkdedfudc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>THE IMPACT</p>
<p>This story is very relatable to anyone who has ever been on a first date. Often, our insecurities get the best of us, and we find ourselves overthinking, and getting tongue tied in everything we say. When we want something very badly such as a relationship with a specific person, our mind often creates false realities of what we want to see, which often leads us to misread the signs that are right in front of us. This short is for anyone who has ever been in a similar situation. Although first dates can be very awkward and uncomfortable, you can always find these humorous moments in them to look back on. We hope that this lighthearted film will make you laugh, and remember that similar to making films, dating can be difficult. But there are always these little special, and humorous moments in them that make it all worth it. </p>
<p>MY FILMMAKING EXPERIENCES:</p>
<p>After nearly a full year at Vancouver Film School, I am confident in directing this shoot. I have directed many comedies such as the VFS episodic: ROOMIES (episode 2). And have been involved in the pre-production and post production of that as well. I have also directed my own studio shoot on a set I was also art director for, which enhanced my knowledge of directing and production design. I have also made some short music videos, as well as emotional shorts for my demo reel. I believe that to be a great director, you need to know your film to heart from it's core, have every scene bring out an emotion. </p>
<p>HOW YOU CAN HELP AND WHAT WE DELIVER IN RETURN</p>
<p>Any fundraising we obtain will be going towards production design, sound design, and costuming. Because this film takes place in a restaurant, we need lots of classy decor, tables, and costumes to create that romantic candlelight atmosphere. Sound design is also very important in this film for we may need layers of restaurant ambience, and sounds of people dining. We are also shooting in a studio so we need to make sure the actor’s voices do not sound muffled. We also must include logistics, such as catering. Donations are more than just a gift.  Overall, we are looking to achieve at least $700 in fundraising for the film.</p>
<p>It's a deed to be very grateful for, as not everybody gets those chances. We want to treat donators as part of our crew, and are offering many different perks to you guys. Some of those perks include a credit on the film, lots of our work we've done to achieve this project such as storyboards, a digital copy of the script, a copy of the film, and more! </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello everyone!<br/><br/>My name is Chris Malone.<br/><br/>I am a student at George Mason University in Fairfax, VA and am raising funds for my senior thesis film.<br/><br/>The film is called <i>Harra and the Donkey</i>. It is a live-action/animated comedy film about Jonny Harra,  a cartoonist who is famous for creating a popular comic strip series featuring Jacky, a friendly and lovable, yet dimwitted and goofy donkey who loves to make people laugh. For the past two years, Jacky’s success has given Jonny and his wife, Meredith, more fame and fortune than they ever thought possible, However, the constant demand for the Jacky comics has begun to wear heavily on a burnt-out Jonny. So much so that he plans to end the Jacky series so he can return to where his true passion lies, doing professional illustrations. However, even though Jonny may be done with Jacky, Jacky is not quite done with Jonny yet. Late one night, while Jonny meticulously draws the final Jacky comic strip, Jacky mysteriously comes to life and begins to interfere in Jonny’s work to persuade Jonny to continue the comic strip. However, each attempt results in Jonny getting more annoyed and throwing Jacky out of his house. But no matter how many times Jonny throws Jacky out, Jacky always manages to pop back into his life. As Jonny’s sanity and patience continue to deteriorate with each visit from Jacky, will Jacky be able to convince Jonny to keep the comic strip going? Or is th-th-th-that all for Jacky?</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As you know, filmmaking is not a cheap endeavor. Even student films like this one need to have some financial backing. So that’s where you come in. We’re asking for at least $2000 to cover filming permits, extra equipment, costumes, makeup, and especially the animation. And to show our appreciation for your support, when you contribute to the film, you will receive a lot of cool perks such as your name in the credits, the script, the poster, and even the film on DVD!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I want to tell this story because it touches upon subject matter that is relatable to artists and anyone else in a career that requires creative thinking. Sometimes, creators can get tired of working on the same project for months or even years on end, even if they enjoyed working on it in the beginning. During these times, they think about stepping away from it and doing something different, but it’s all a matter of whether to stop the project altogether or simply take some time off from it and come back to it fully revitalized. This is also a story about acceptance; not only of the accomplishments in your career, no matter how insignificant you feel they are, but of the past as well. Only with this acceptance, will you be able to move forward to a better future. Additionally, by supporting this campaign, you will support student filmmaking as a whole and encourage those who are still in school to express their creativity and share it with the world.</p>

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Javed, a television mechanic from Rampur, North India travelled to Karachi, Pakistan in 2001 for a family wedding. In Karachi, he fell in love with Mobina. Their silent romance bloomed for those few weeks, and before departing to India, Javed promised that he will marry her next year after figuring out the logistics, she promised that she will wait for him.</p>
<p>In December 2001 the Indian Parliament was attacked by Pakistani militants. Indo-Pak relationship deteriorated, borders were shut down and travels suspend. Javed kept his romance alive by calling Mobina everyday from a public phone and sending her love letters. One day, under cover agents broke into Javed's shop and arrested him. He was taken to an undisclosed location and tortured for three days. He was accused of being a Pakistani spy.</p>
<p>Javed was imprisoned for 11 years. His skills as a television mechanic, and his love for Mobina helped him survive those brutal years. He never contacted Mobina again on his lawyer's advice. When he was finally pardoned by the court of law, proven to be fully innocent and free of any guilt, he started to get his life back in order. But one thought always haunted him, what of Mobina, what of his promise to her?  </p>
<p>This documentary is made on Javed's request. He wants the film to be his final letter to Mobina, so that she can understand what happened to him, the injustice he had faced for so many years, and how her memories helped him survive. He wants to act out the scenes from his life with his friends and family so that she can feel the essence of his story and ordeal. This film is his final message to Mobina, wishing her well and apologizing for not keeping his promise.</p>
<p>We hope to take the film to international documentary film festivals and then push for a release on the big screens and on popular online streaming platforms for the world to watch.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Through self financing, we took a leap of faith and shot half the film in April. Drawn by our footage and compelled by Javed's story, a leading Norwegian Producer came on board to finance the post production of the film (Editing + Sound + Color Correction + Final outputs).</p>
<p>Now we need your support to help us raise the finance for the other half of the film. The other half will be shot over 30 days.  100% of your contributions will be spent on camera &amp; sound equipment + team accommodation &amp; living + location permissions +  transport logistics + giving Javed and his friends &amp; family their daily salary so they can take out the time to work on this project (they come from a very modest economical background). Our core technical team has agreed to come on board without any fees, inspired only by the power of the story. </p>
<p>If you like the story of the film, then you can get various perks for your contribution. From something as simple as a link to watch the film, to a poster, to an invitation to the premiere, to even having your name listed on IMDB! Film Screenings for the backers will be held in New Delhi, Warsaw and Estonia. However, we are open to other cities if we get some support. </p>
<p>Our motto is 'No money is small enough or big enough to make a film', but we need to raise a sum of $12,000 to complete the film shoot comfortably. Every contribution is valuable. If we fall short, we will shed more blood, sweat and tears and accomplish the shoot, the completion of this project is a matter of life and death for us! Such a compelling story must be told.      </p>

The story provides perspective on the notion that we are a product of our environment, by exploring the themes of parenting and the consequences of neglect. The idea of “present but absent” occurs when parents are emotionally unavailable to nurture their children. Since attention and affirmation are important to a child’s development, this void can lead to low self esteem and a tendency to act out and misbehave in order to get the attention they crave.</p><p>The concept of a “spying” elf doll is an intriguing metaphor, because even if exaggerated, it is conceivable to depict the activity as an easy out for parents; allowing them to shift the responsibility of disciplining and nurturing their children to an inanimate object. This isn’t any different than handing a child a smartphone or video game in lieu of quality time and attention.</p><p>By way of fable, our story examines what happens when present but absent backfires. What if the elf is really watching? What if he’s able to respond and teach a lesson?</p><p>Despite the serious subject matter and themes of the film, on the surface, we are still making a psychological horror film that plays with the folklore of this holiday tradition. We fell in love with the idea of turning the pop-culture icon into a nightmare inducing horror. It is going to be dark. It is going to be creepy. And it is going to be extremely stylized. In that regard, this film requires a much higher commitment to production value than our previous works, which is why we need your help!</p><h2>THE DOLL</h2><p>There are two key prop elements that are crucial to the production of our film, the elf doll and the accompanying story book.</p><p>We are ecstatic to have the opportunity to partner with an accomplished and world renowned doll maker to bring our stylized vision to life. Of course, designing, modeling, and creating a poseable porcelain doll that is camera ready is no small feat and it is certainly not cheap. The production process for one doll will take over 4 months and will require a significant portion of the budget.</p><p>Regardless, the process is extremely fascinating and exciting, so we will be documenting and sharing the progress regularly with donors. In this way, we hope that the doll takes on a life of his own. Stay tuned for updates!</p><h2>THE STORY BOOK</h2><p>In order to properly tell our story, we need to produce an illustrated story book that accompanies the elf doll and explains the folklore of the elf. In the film, the stories read from the book provide valuable context to the narrative. Similar to the elf doll, we are partnering with an extremely talented illustrator to create our own stylized interpretation of the book for use in the film. Again, there are unavoidable costs associated with this process, which is why we need your help!</p><h2>PRODUCTION</h2><p>We will be shooting on location in Pittsburgh, PA in Q1 of 2019. Our cast and crew consists of film professionals, many of whom are generously giving up their time to help us out with the bottom line. Due to the seasonal relevance of our film, it likely will not be released to the public until the fall of 2019. That being said, contributors will have the exclusive opportunity to see the film before its release, when production is complete.</p><h2>THE MONEY</h2><p>We are looking to raise $10,000 through this campaign to pay for production and post-production costs. We can assure you, none of it will be going into our pockets. We extremely appreciate your kindness, generosity, and dedication to supporting art.

What if he’s able to respond and teach a lesson?Despite the serious subject matter and themes of the film, on the surface, we are still making a psychological horror film that plays with the folklore of this holiday tradition. We fell in love with the idea of turning the pop-culture icon into a nightmare inducing horror. It is going to be dark. It is going to be creepy. And it is going to be extremely stylized. In that regard, this film requires a much higher commitment to production value than our previous works, which is why we need your help!THE DOLLThere are two key prop elements that are crucial to the production of our film, the elf doll and the accompanying story book.We are ecstatic to have the opportunity to partner with an accomplished and world renowned doll maker to bring our stylized vision to life. Of course, designing, modeling, and creating a poseable porcelain doll that is camera ready is no small feat and it is certainly not cheap. The production process for one doll will take over 4 months and will require a significant portion of the budget.Regardless, the process is extremely fascinating and exciting, so we will be documenting and sharing the progress regularly with donors. In this way, we hope that the doll takes on a life of his own. Stay tuned for updates!THE STORY BOOKIn order to properly tell our story, we need to produce an illustrated story book that accompanies the elf doll and explains the folklore of the elf. In the film, the stories read from the book provide valuable context to the narrative. Similar to the elf doll, we are partnering with an extremely talented illustrator to create our own stylized interpretation of the book for use in the film. Again, there are unavoidable costs associated with this process, which is why we need your help!PRODUCTIONWe will be shooting on location in Pittsburgh, PA in Q1 of 2019. Our cast and crew consists of film professionals, many of whom are generously giving up their time to help us out with the bottom line. Due to the seasonal relevance of our film, it likely will not be released to the public until the fall of 2019. That being said, contributors will have the exclusive opportunity to see the film before its release, when production is complete.THE MONEYWe are looking to raise $10,000 through this campaign to pay for production and post-production costs. We can assure you, none of it will be going into our pockets. We extremely appreciate your kindness, generosity, and dedication to supporting art.

If you are local to Pittsburgh, we could always use an extra hand with the production.THE TEAMWe have put together an incredible team so far (with more to be added) of film professionals all with significant experience in the industry. You can view some of our previous works here.CASTJennifer Andrada - AlisonJennifer Andrada has been a professional actress for over ten years, working in film, theater, television, and commercials. A prolific voice actor as well, she has lent her voice to a host of audiobooks, educational videos, television and radio commercials. She can be seen playing the character Sophia Bennett on WGNs OUTSIDERS and is a series regular on the family comedy web series Jack and Emma.Allan Snyder - AndrewAllan Snyder moved to Pittsburgh three years ago from New York, where he appeared on Broadway in Les Miserables (original production, final cast) and off-Broadway in the iconic, long-running The Fantasticks. Allan also traveled the country for two years with the national tour of The Phantom of the Opera, often appearing in the title role. Since moving to Pittsburgh he has performed with the Pittsburgh Public Theater (Hamlet, Daddy Long Legs), the Pittsburgh CLO (The 39 Steps, Titanic) as well as many other local theatres. On camera Allan has appeared in commercials for the Pittsburgh Pirates, UPMC, and Giant Eagle and look for him in the upcoming films Unsinkable and Pickled (starring Seth Rogen).Payten Fisher - MeganPayten Fisher is a brilliant young talent who is making her acting debut in The Elf In The Room. Taking influence from Millie Bobbie Brown of Stranger Things', Payten has a flair for the dramatic, so she is very excited to have a serious role in the horror genre. Although cheerleading is her outlet when she wants to get her groove on, Payten also loves to play the sims and fortnight. CREWDarin DiNapoli - Director & EditorFraming every aspect of his life in cinematic fashion, Darin DiNapoli never ceases to offer an interesting perspective. But, seeing life through his own lense has allowed Darin to develop a style of storytelling that is as intriguing as it is proficient. A creative being by nature, Darin earned his technical savvy over 10 years of working as both a professional editor and director of photography on commercial projects for national brands. In that time, Darin also began receiving major attention for his independent projects, including an Emmy award for a music video produced for his band Identity X. Over the course of the last three years, Darin has been busy collaborating with other industry professionals to make over 9 short films across multiple genres and winning multiple awards; including BEST FILM for the horror flick ""Rorschach"" at the Pittsburgh 48 Hour Film Festival and a nomination for BEST FILM for “Nakama” at the LA 48 Hour Film Festival. Nakama received continued attention internationally for months following the festival. DiNapoli’s film “Sketch” also garnered attention in the Four Points Film Festival after being honored in the top 25 out of over 200 international entries. Darin’s passion for filmmaking remains strong as he intends to parlay these experiences into a career making movies in Hollywood.Jonathan A. Joseph - WriterAs a musician and professional web designer, Jonathan Joseph has always been creating. But, it wasn’t until he ‘accidentally’ joined one of director Darin DiNapoli’s projects that he found his passion for filmmaking. When one of his ideas evolved into a major plot point, he suddenly found himself co-writing the award winning and internationally recognized short “Nakama.” Since then, Jonathan has penned six more of DiNapoli’s films, also earning international accolades for “Sketch.” With every project, Jonathan writes with the intention of creating something meaningful. At the very least, he wants the audience to come away thinking.Amanda Williams - ProducerAmanda Williams is a Pittsburgh native with a 12 year career in professional production, specializing in production management, logistics, and casting. Her highlights include 4 years as the Casting Coordinator and Associate Producer on the Emmy nominated game show Who Wants to be a Millionaire, as well as coordinating production logistics for a shoot in the Oval Office with President Obama. Amanda has a passion for evocative stories and believes in film as a powerful outlet for artistic expression.Chris Catone - ComposerChris Catone is a composer, producer and multi-instrumentalist whose music is deeply rooted in the merging of technology and the natural sound. His life and work is a balance between sacred silence and the din of the outside world. As an active composer of chamber and film music, Chris’ work has been performed by Alia Musica Pittsburgh, Trillium Ensemble, A Far Cry Ensemble, The Heinz Chapel Compline Choir, St. Maurice Chamber Singers, Kassia Ensemble and others. His music for film has won awards at prominent film festivals such as the Los Angeles 48 Hour Film Fest, Four Points Film Festival and Filmapalooza. Chris has also assisted on various projects with film composer/producer Junkie XL at Hans Zimmer’s Remote Control Productions in Los Angeles, California.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>On September 14, 1943, after a series of successful attacks against Axis ships, Greek submarine Y1 ""Lambros Katsonis"" was spotted and attacked by a German submarine chaser near the island of Skiathos. The Greek crew fought an uneven, epic battle; the men of Y1 wouldn’t give up even when they were left with just a small-caliber deck gun against the much larger and more effective German weapons. Finally, the enemy ship rammed and sank the submarine. During the battle, 32 men were killed or lost forever in the Aegean Sea; the Germans captured most survivors.</p>

<p>However, Second-in-Command Elias Tsoukalas and another two crew members survived and managed to swim for 9 hours to reach the shore. They would later rejoin the Greek Naval Forces to keep fighting for the Allied cause.</p>
<p><strong>The location of the Y1 “Katsonis” shipwreck remained a mystery for decades. Until now.</strong></p>

<p>In May 2018 we teamed up with the Greek Navy, as well as a highly skilled group of experts in military history and underwater research, and set off to locate and film the Y1 wreck. After an eventful operation, the submarine was found and identified northwest of Skiathos, at a depth of 253 meters (830 feet), using state-of-the-art underwater exploration technology.</p>

<p>We are <strong>Team Faos</strong>, an independent Greek production company. Although small, our team has vast experience in TV and film production, working mainly for major international broadcasters. In the past few years, we have invested almost all our profits in producing our own films. We have succesfully produced three feature-length documentaries: <i>Emery Tales</i> (2015), <i>Argo Navis</i> (2016) and <i>Down Time</i> (to be released soon). Our films have won numerous awards in international festivals, including the Audience Award for Best Documentary at the 18th Thessaloniki Documentary Festival for <i>Argo Navis</i>.</p>
<p><strong>""Y1: Silence of the Deep""</strong> is our fourth and most ambitious film to date; most of it was the result of very hard work by these three people:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544572983/kepbtu4m8fvfawfcohzr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>It goes without saying that we had the invaluable help of many other professionals during filming, including a second camera team, a drone operator, assistant producers and directors, sound engineers, a ""making of"" crew, and more. Many of them worked voluntarily because they fell in love with the ""Y1"" story as much as we did.</p>
<p>With their help, after more than two years, we have already completed 90% of the filming on ""Y1: Silence of the Deep"", with a large investment in money and time. </p>
<p><strong>We are now ready to begin post-production- this is where YOU come in.</strong></p>

<p>Pre-production and filming has cost more than 65.000 € (~74.000 $), of which 30.000 € (~34.000 $) was spent for the wreck identification and filming operation alone. This amount is HUGE for Greek standards, especially during these times of crisis. We expect to cover at least part of the pre-production and filming budget from ERT (Greek Public Television) and/or GFC (Greek FIlm Center) funds. However, we still need a little over 36.000 € (~40.900 $) to be able to afford the absolute minimum needs of post-production and complete the film, <strong>not including any pay for the core creative team.</strong></p>

<p>When we started research on this project in October 2016, we were absolutely clueless regarding shipwrecks and underwater filming. We hadn't even heard of submarine ""Y1"" before we accidentaly stumbled upon Elias Tsoukalas's book ""Submarine Y1 - Lambros Katsonis"".

<p>Στις 14 Σεπτεμβρίου του 1943, μετά από μια σειρά επιτυχημένων επιθέσεων ενάντια σε πλοία του Άξονα, το ελληνικό υποβρύχιο Υ1 ""Λάμπρος Κατσώνης"" εντοπίστηκε και δέχθηκε επίθεση από ένα γερμανικό ανθυποβρυχιακό . Το ελληνικό πλήρωμα ρίχτηκε σε μία άνιση, επική μάχη. Οι άντρες του Υ1 δεν παραδόθηκαν, ακόμη και όταν έμειναν μόνο με ένα μικρό πυροβόλο ενάντια στους πάνοπλους Γερμανούς. Τελικά, το εχθρικό πλοίο εμβόλισε και βύθισε το υποβρύχιο. Κατά τη διάρκεια της μάχης, 32 άντρες σκοτώθηκαν ή χάθηκαν για πάντα στο Αιγαίο. Οι Γερμανοί αιχμαλώτισαν τους περισσότερους επιζώντες.</p>

<p>Ωστόσο, ο ύπαρχος Ηλίας Τσουκαλάς και άλλα δύο μέλη του πληρώματος επέζησαν και κατάφεραν να κολυμπήσουν για 9 ώρες μέχρι να φτάσουν στην ακτή. Αργότερα, επανεντάχθηκαν στο Ναυτικό για να συνεχίσουν να μάχονται για τη νίκη των Συμμάχων.</p>
<p><strong>Η ακριβής τοποθεσία του ναυαγίου του Υ1 «Κατσώνης» παρέμενε μυστήριο για δεκαετίες- αυτό όμως άλλαξε πρόσφατα.</strong></p>
<h3>Κινηματογραφώντας σε βάθος 253 μέτρων</h3>
<p>Το Μάιο του 2018, η εταιρία τηλεοπτικών και κινηματογραφικών παραγωγών TeamFAOS Productions μαζί με το Πολεμικό Ναυτικό και μια ομάδα ειδικών στη στρατιωτική ιστορία και τις υποβρύχιες έρευνες, ξεκίνησε μία προσπάθεια να εντοπίσει το ναυάγιο του Υ1. Μετά από μία περιπετειώδη επιχείρηση, με χρήση υποβρύχιου εξοπλισμού τελευταίας τεχνολογίας, το υποβρύχιο εντοπίστηκε και ταυτοποιήθηκε βορειοδυτικά της Σκιάθου, σε βάθος 253 μέτρων.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544395876/zpabmfe0ov6msi10no3k.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Αντλώντας έμπνευση από το βραβευμένο βιβλίο του Ηλία Τσουκαλά, ""Υποβρύχιον Υ1 - Λάμπρος Κατσώνης"", η ομάδα μας ερευνούσε αρχεία, συγκέντρωνε υλικό, έπαιρνε συνεντεύξεις από ειδικούς και αναζητούσε συγγενείς των μελών του πληρώματος επί σχεδόν δύο χρόνια πριν την επιχείρηση. Δύο συγγενείς – «κλειδιά», συμπεριλαμβανομένης της Μπήλιως Τσουκαλά, κόρης του Ύπαρχου Ηλία Τσουκαλά, συμφώνησαν να συμπράξουν ως πρωταγωνιστές στο πιο φιλόδοξο, συναρπαστικό ντοκιμαντέρ που έχουμε παράξει έως τώρα.

<h3>Ποιοι είμαστε</h3>
<p>Η <strong>Team Faos </strong>είναι μία ανεξάρτητη ελληνική εταιρία παραγωγής. Παρότι η ομάδα μας είναι μικρή, έχει τεράστια εμπειρία στις τηλεοπτικές και κινηματογραφικές παραγωγές. Οι βασικοί πελάτες μας είναι μεγάλα τηλεοπτικά δίκτυα του εξωτερικού, όπως η γερμανική δημόσια τηλεόραση. Τα τελευταία χρόνια επενδύουμε σχεδόν όλα τα κέρδη μας σε δικές μας παραγωγές. Μέχρι τώρα έχουμε ολοκληρώσει με επιτυχία τρία ντοκιμαντέρ μεγάλου μήκους: το <i>Emery Tales </i>(2015), το <i>Argo Navis</i> (2016) και το <i>Down Time </i>(κυκλοφορεί σύντομα). Οι ταινίες μας έχουν κερδίσει πολυάριθμα βραβεία σε διεθνή φεστιβάλ, συμπεριλαμβανομένου του Βραβείου Κοινού για Καλύτερο Ντοκιμαντέρ στο 18ο Φεστιβάλ Ντοκιμαντέρ Θεσσαλονίκης για το <i>Argo Navis</i>.</p>
<p>To <strong>""Y1: Στη Σιωπή του Βυθού""</strong> είναι το τέταρτο και πιο φιλόδοξό μας ντοκιμαντέρ μέχρι τώρα. Ήταν το αποτέλεσμα πολύ σκληρής δουλειάς κυρίως τριών ανθρώπων:</p>
<ul>
<li>Στέλιος Ευσταθόπουλος, Επικεφαλής Παραγωγής &amp; Διευθυντής Φωτογραφίας</li>
<li>Φίλιππος Βαρδάκας, Σκηνοθέτης</li>
<li>Μάγδα Γεωργιάδου, Σεναριογράφος</li>
</ul>
<p>Φυσικά, κατά τη διάρκεια των λήψεων είχαμε την ανεκτίμητη βοήθεια πολλών ακόμη επαγγελματιών. Ενδεικτικά εργάστηκαν για την ταινία ένα δεύτερο κινηματογραφικό συνεργείο, ένας χειριστής drone, βοηθοί παραγωγής και σκηνοθέτη, ηχολήπτες, ένα ξεχωριστό συνεργείο για το ""making of"" και άλλοι. Πολλοί από αυτούς δούλεψαν εθελοντικά επειδή ερωτεύτηκαν την ιστορία του Υ1 όσο κι εμείς.</p>
<p>Με τη βοήθειά τους, μετά από ένα διάστημα που ξεπέρασε τα δύο χρόνια, έχουμε ολοκληρώσει το 90% των γυρισμάτων για το ""Υ1: Στη Σιωπή του Βυθού"", επενδύοντας πολύ χρόνο και χρήμα.</p>
<p><strong>Είμαστε πλέον έτοιμοι για το μοντάζ και τις υπόλοιπες εργασίες αποπεράτωσης του ντοκιμαντέρ- εδώ είναι που θα χρειαστούμε ΕΣΑΣ.</strong></p>
<h3>Τι χρειαζόμαστε</h3>
<p>Οι εργασίες προ-παραγωγής και οι λήψεις έχουν κοστίσει πάνω από 65.000 €, από τα οποία οι 30.000 € επενδύθηκαν μόνο στην επιχείρηση ταυτοποίησης και κινηματογράφησης του ναυαγίου. Τα ποσά αυτά είναι ΤΕΡΑΣΤΙΑ για τα ελληνικά δεδομένα, ειδικά αυτή την εποχή. Πιστεύουμε ότι τουλάχιστον μέρος αυτών των εξόδων (προ-παραγωγή και λήψεις) θα καλυφθούν από χορηγίες της ΕΡΤ ή/και του Ελληνικού Κέντρου Κινηματογράφου. Παρόλα αυτά, χρειαζόμαστε ακόμη κάτι παραπάνω από 36.000 € (40.900 $) για να μπορέσουμε να πληρώσουμε τα απολύτως απαραίτητα στο στάδιο της αποπεράτωσης της ταινίας, <strong>χωρίς να συμπεριλαμβάνεται καμία αμοιβή για τον πυρήνα της δημιουργικής ομάδας.</strong></p>
<p>Οι δωρεές σας θα καλύψουν:</p>
<ul>
<li>Το μοντάζ της ταινίας</li>
<li>Ένα 3D animation της τελικής ναυμαχίας του Υ1 - ""Κατσώνης""</li>
<li>Σύνθεση και ηχογράφηση πρωτότυπης μουσικής από το Galan Trio</li>
<li>Voice acting (σπικάζ ηθοποιών) και ηχογραφήσεις</li>

On September 14, 1943, after a series of successful attacks against Axis ships, Greek submarine Y1 ""Lambros Katsonis"" was spotted and attacked by a German submarine chaser near the island of Skiathos. The Greek crew fought an uneven, epic battle; the men of Y1 wouldn’t give up even when they were left with just a small-caliber deck gun against the much larger and more effective German weapons. Finally, the enemy ship rammed and sank the submarine. During the battle, 32 men were killed or lost forever in the Aegean Sea; the Germans captured most survivors.

The Y1 ""Katsonis"" - Photo from survivor Elias Tsoukalas's personal archive
However, Second-in-Command Elias Tsoukalas and another two crew members survived and managed to swim for 9 hours to reach the shore. They would later rejoin the Greek Naval Forces to keep fighting for the Allied cause.
The location of the Y1 “Katsonis” shipwreck remained a mystery for decades. Until now.

In May 2018 we teamed up with the Greek Navy, as well as a highly skilled group of experts in military history and underwater research, and set off to locate and film the Y1 wreck. After an eventful operation, the submarine was found and identified northwest of Skiathos, at a depth of 253 meters (830 feet), using state-of-the-art underwater exploration technology.

R.O.V. (Remotely operated underwater vehicle) submerged during the Y1 identification operation, May 2018
Inspired by Elias Tsoukalas's book, ""Submarine Y1 - Lambros Katsonis"", our team had already been researching files, collecting archive material, interviewing experts, locating relatives of the crew for almost two years. Two key relatives -including Tsoukalas's daughter, journalist Bilio Tsoukala- agreed to join us as protagonists in our most ambitious, exciting documentary yet. They became our valuable guides, as we followed the path that the heroic crew members took 75 years ago.

One of the first images of the ""Y1"" shipwreck, captured by a R.O.V.-mounted camera
This film will not just be another history documentary; it will be a fascinating World War 2 story the world needs to know about; plus, a great underwater exploration film. 

We are Team Faos, an independent Greek production company. Although small, our team has vast experience in TV and film production, working mainly for major international broadcasters. In the past few years, we have invested almost all our profits in producing our own films. We have succesfully produced three feature-length documentaries: Emery Tales (2015), Argo Navis (2016) and Down Time (to be released soon). Our films have won numerous awards in international festivals, including the Audience Award for Best Documentary at the 18th Thessaloniki Documentary Festival for Argo Navis.
""Y1: Silence of the Deep"" is our fourth and most ambitious film to date; most of it was the result of very hard work by these three people:



It goes without saying that we had the invaluable help of many other professionals during filming, including a second camera team, a drone operator, assistant producers and directors, sound engineers, a ""making of"" crew, and more. Many of them worked voluntarily because they fell in love with the ""Y1"" story as much as we did.
With their help, after more than two years, we have already completed 90% of the filming on ""Y1: Silence of the Deep"", with a large investment in money and time. 
We are now ready to begin post-production- this is where YOU come in.

Pre-production and filming has cost more than 65.000 € (~74.000 $), of which 30.000 € (~34.000 $) was spent for the wreck identification and filming operation alone. This amount is HUGE for Greek standards, especially during these times of crisis. We expect to cover at least part of the pre-production and filming budget from ERT (Greek Public Television) and/or GFC (Greek FIlm Center) funds. However, we still need a little over 36.000 € (~40.900 $) to be able to afford the absolute minimum needs of post-production and complete the film, not including any pay for the core creative team.
Your donations will go towards:

Editing the film
A 3D animation of the final naval battle of ""Y1""
Original soundtrack by Galan Trio
Voice acting and voice-over recording
Sound design & mixing
Color correction
Graphics and credit sequence design
Archive material licensing
Translations and subtitling
DCP


Even the smallest contribution can take us a long way towards our goal of bringing ""Y1: Silence of the Deep"" to the world. That's why we want to give something back to each and every one of our backers.

A crew needs able seamen, as much as it needs a good Captain; we highly appreciate each and every contribution that will be made to this campaign. We have decided to include the names of all backers in the end credits of the film. Of course, we have also prepared several unique perks, including some limited edition items you might want to grab early on! 








According to our current planning, we will be able to complete the film and deliver all perks by September 2019.
At this point, you might  be asking yourself: ""Can I trust these guys?"". Read on!

When we started research on this project in October 2016, we were absolutely clueless regarding shipwrecks and underwater filming. We hadn't even heard of submarine ""Y1"" before we accidentaly stumbled upon Elias Tsoukalas's book ""Submarine Y1 - Lambros Katsonis"". But from that moment on, we were determined to make our most ambitious documentary yet a reality. 

Waiting for the first images of the wreck aboard Greek Navy hydrographic vessel HS Nautilus
In the course of these past two years, we managed to get the Greek Navy on board; we located and interviewed crew members' descedentants; we gained access to previously unreleased military files from Greece, Germany and the UK; we travelled to Mount Pelion and the island of Skiathos, following the path of the survivors; we finally filmed the wreck, in an unprecedented operation, at least for Greek standards.
Our story has already been featured in countless Greek media, including Kathimerini  newspaper, Lifo and Esquire magazine.
We can't allow ourselves to fail after all the money, time and energy we've put in this project.
We are determined to make this documentary happen.

We know you've already seen many WW2 documentaries. We know you've also seen a lot of movies about war heroes, and probably a few films about shipwrecks, too. 
But this is a chance to tell a story of ordinary men, who did extraordinary things; a story of a crew that refused to surrender, although they had a choice; a story of standing up for one's country, even when all hope is lost. 
Let's tell this story to the world. Become a backer now! If you can't contribute, at least make sure you share this campaign via e-mail, Facebook or Twitter!
THANK YOU!

 Μία άγνωστη ιστορία του Β' Παγκοσμίου Πολέμου
(Αν γνωρίζετε ήδη την ιστορία και θέλετε απλώς οδηγίες για να κάνετε δωρεά, πατήστε εδώ από σταθερό υπολογιστή ή κάντε κύλιση στην ενότητα ""Τι σας προσφέρουμε"" από κινητό)
Στις 14 Σεπτεμβρίου του 1943, μετά από μια σειρά επιτυχημένων επιθέσεων ενάντια σε πλοία του Άξονα, το ελληνικό υποβρύχιο Υ1 ""Λάμπρος Κατσώνης"" εντοπίστηκε και δέχθηκε επίθεση από ένα γερμανικό ανθυποβρυχιακό . Το ελληνικό πλήρωμα ρίχτηκε σε μία άνιση, επική μάχη. Οι άντρες του Υ1 δεν παραδόθηκαν, ακόμη και όταν έμειναν μόνο με ένα μικρό πυροβόλο ενάντια στους πάνοπλους Γερμανούς. Τελικά, το εχθρικό πλοίο εμβόλισε και βύθισε το υποβρύχιο. Κατά τη διάρκεια της μάχης, 32 άντρες σκοτώθηκαν ή χάθηκαν για πάντα στο Αιγαίο. Οι Γερμανοί αιχμαλώτισαν τους περισσότερους επιζώντες.


Το υποβρύχιο Υ1 ""Κατσώνης"" - Φωτογραφία από το προσωπικό αρχείο του Ηλία Τσουκαλά
Ωστόσο, ο ύπαρχος Ηλίας Τσουκαλάς και άλλα δύο μέλη του πληρώματος επέζησαν και κατάφεραν να κολυμπήσουν για 9 ώρες μέχρι να φτάσουν στην ακτή. Αργότερα, επανεντάχθηκαν στο Ναυτικό για να συνεχίσουν να μάχονται για τη νίκη των Συμμάχων.
Η ακριβής τοποθεσία του ναυαγίου του Υ1 «Κατσώνης» παρέμενε μυστήριο για δεκαετίες- αυτό όμως άλλαξε πρόσφατα.
Κινηματογραφώντας σε βάθος 253 μέτρων
Το Μάιο του 2018, η εταιρία τηλεοπτικών και κινηματογραφικών παραγωγών TeamFAOS Productions μαζί με το Πολεμικό Ναυτικό και μια ομάδα ειδικών στη στρατιωτική ιστορία και τις υποβρύχιες έρευνες, ξεκίνησε μία προσπάθεια να εντοπίσει το ναυάγιο του Υ1. Μετά από μία περιπετειώδη επιχείρηση, με χρήση υποβρύχιου εξοπλισμού τελευταίας τεχνολογίας, το υποβρύχιο εντοπίστηκε και ταυτοποιήθηκε βορειοδυτικά της Σκιάθου, σε βάθος 253 μέτρων.

Ένα R.O.V. (ρομποτικό - τηλεκατευθυνόμενο υποβρύχιο όχημα) καταδύεται κατά τη διάρκεια της επιχείρησης ταυτοποίησης του Υ1, Μάιος 2018
Αντλώντας έμπνευση από το βραβευμένο βιβλίο του Ηλία Τσουκαλά, ""Υποβρύχιον Υ1 - Λάμπρος Κατσώνης"", η ομάδα μας ερευνούσε αρχεία, συγκέντρωνε υλικό, έπαιρνε συνεντεύξεις από ειδικούς και αναζητούσε συγγενείς των μελών του πληρώματος επί σχεδόν δύο χρόνια πριν την επιχείρηση. Δύο συγγενείς – «κλειδιά», συμπεριλαμβανομένης της Μπήλιως Τσουκαλά, κόρης του Ύπαρχου Ηλία Τσουκαλά, συμφώνησαν να συμπράξουν ως πρωταγωνιστές στο πιο φιλόδοξο, συναρπαστικό ντοκιμαντέρ που έχουμε παράξει έως τώρα. Έγιναν οι πολύτιμοι οδηγοί μας, καθώς ακολουθούσαμε τη διαδρομή που έκαναν τα ηρωικά μέλη του πληρώματος του Υ1 πριν 75 χρόνια.

Μία από τις πρώτες εικόνες του ναυαγίου του Υ1, που καταγράφηκε από κάμερα τοποθετημένη πάνω σε R.O.V.
Θα είναι μία συναρπαστική ιστορία του Β' Παγκοσμίου Πολέμου που πρέπει να γίνει γνωστή- αλλά και μία μοναδική ταινία υποβρύχιας εξερεύνησης.
Ποιοι είμαστε
Η Team Faos είναι μία ανεξάρτητη ελληνική εταιρία παραγωγής. Παρότι η ομάδα μας είναι μικρή, έχει τεράστια εμπειρία στις τηλεοπτικές και κινηματογραφικές παραγωγές. Οι βασικοί πελάτες μας είναι μεγάλα τηλεοπτικά δίκτυα του εξωτερικού, όπως η γερμανική δημόσια τηλεόραση. Τα τελευταία χρόνια επενδύουμε σχεδόν όλα τα κέρδη μας σε δικές μας παραγωγές. Μέχρι τώρα έχουμε ολοκληρώσει με επιτυχία τρία ντοκιμαντέρ μεγάλου μήκους: το Emery Tales (2015), το Argo Navis (2016) και το Down Time (κυκλοφορεί σύντομα). Οι ταινίες μας έχουν κερδίσει πολυάριθμα βραβεία σε διεθνή φεστιβάλ, συμπεριλαμβανομένου του Βραβείου Κοινού για Καλύτερο Ντοκιμαντέρ στο 18ο Φεστιβάλ Ντοκιμαντέρ Θεσσαλονίκης για το Argo Navis.
To ""Y1: Στη Σιωπή του Βυθού"" είναι το τέταρτο και πιο φιλόδοξό μας ντοκιμαντέρ μέχρι τώρα. Ήταν το αποτέλεσμα πολύ σκληρής δουλειάς κυρίως τριών ανθρώπων:

Στέλιος Ευσταθόπουλος, Επικεφαλής Παραγωγής & Διευθυντής Φωτογραφίας
Φίλιππος Βαρδάκας, Σκηνοθέτης
Μάγδα Γεωργιάδου, Σεναριογράφος

Φυσικά, κατά τη διάρκεια των λήψεων είχαμε την ανεκτίμητη βοήθεια πολλών ακόμη επαγγελματιών. Ενδεικτικά εργάστηκαν για την ταινία ένα δεύτερο κινηματογραφικό συνεργείο, ένας χειριστής drone, βοηθοί παραγωγής και σκηνοθέτη, ηχολήπτες, ένα ξεχωριστό συνεργείο για το ""making of"" και άλλοι. Πολλοί από αυτούς δούλεψαν εθελοντικά επειδή ερωτεύτηκαν την ιστορία του Υ1 όσο κι εμείς.
Με τη βοήθειά τους, μετά από ένα διάστημα που ξεπέρασε τα δύο χρόνια, έχουμε ολοκληρώσει το 90% των γυρισμάτων για το ""Υ1: Στη Σιωπή του Βυθού"", επενδύοντας πολύ χρόνο και χρήμα.
Είμαστε πλέον έτοιμοι για το μοντάζ και τις υπόλοιπες εργασίες αποπεράτωσης του ντοκιμαντέρ- εδώ είναι που θα χρειαστούμε ΕΣΑΣ.
Τι χρειαζόμαστε
Οι εργασίες προ-παραγωγής και οι λήψεις έχουν κοστίσει πάνω από 65.000 €, από τα οποία οι 30.000 € επενδύθηκαν μόνο στην επιχείρηση ταυτοποίησης και κινηματογράφησης του ναυαγίου. Τα ποσά αυτά είναι ΤΕΡΑΣΤΙΑ για τα ελληνικά δεδομένα, ειδικά αυτή την εποχή. Πιστεύουμε ότι τουλάχιστον μέρος αυτών των εξόδων (προ-παραγωγή και λήψεις) θα καλυφθούν από χορηγίες της ΕΡΤ ή/και του Ελληνικού Κέντρου Κινηματογράφου. Παρόλα αυτά, χρειαζόμαστε ακόμη κάτι παραπάνω από 36.000 € (40.900 $) για να μπορέσουμε να πληρώσουμε τα απολύτως απαραίτητα στο στάδιο της αποπεράτωσης της ταινίας, χωρίς να συμπεριλαμβάνεται καμία αμοιβή για τον πυρήνα της δημιουργικής ομάδας.
Οι δωρεές σας θα καλύψουν:

Το μοντάζ της ταινίας
Ένα 3D animation της τελικής ναυμαχίας του Υ1 - ""Κατσώνης""
Σύνθεση και ηχογράφηση πρωτότυπης μουσικής από το Galan Trio
Voice acting (σπικάζ ηθοποιών) και ηχογραφήσεις
Sound design and mixing (σχεδιασμός ήχου)
Color correction (διόρθωση / διαβάθμιση χρώματος)
Γραφικά και σχεδιασμός τίτλων
Άδειες χρήσης αρχειακού υλικού
Μεταφράσεις και υποτιτλισμοί
DCP (δημιουργία ψηφιακής μήτρας)


Ακόμη και η μικρότερη συνεισφορά θα μας βοηθήσει πολύ να πετύχουμε το στόχο μας: να ολοκληρώσουμε το ντοκιμαντέρ και να συμβάλουμε στο να μαθευτεί η ιστορία του ""Υ1"" σε όλο τον κόσμο. Γι' αυτό και θέλουμε να προσφέρουμε κάτι σε καθέναν από τους υποστηρικτές μας.

Κατά τη διάρκεια των τελευταίων δύο ετών καταφέραμε να έχουμε το Πολεμικό Ναυτικό αρωγό στην προσπάθειά μας, να εντοπίσουμε και να κάνουμε συνεντεύξεις με απογόνους των μελών του πληρώματος, να αποκτήσουμε πρόσβαση σε στρατιωτικά αρχεία από την Ελλάδα, τη Γερμανία και το Ηνωμένο Βασίλειο. Ταξιδέψαμε στο Πήλιο και τη Σκιάθο, ακολουθώντας τα χνάρια των επιζώντων του ""Κατσώνη"". Και, τελικά, κινηματογραφήσαμε το ναυάγιο, σε μία επιχείρηση χωρίς προηγούμενο, τουλάχιστον στην Ελλάδα.
Έχουν ήδη γράψει για εμάς η Καθημερινή, η Lifo, το Esquire και πολλά ακόμη ΜΜΕ.
Δεν μπορούμε να επιτρέψουμε στους εαυτούς μας την αποτυχία, ύστερα από τόσα χρήματα, χρόνο και ενέργεια που έχουμε επενδύσει σε αυτό το εγχείρημα.
Είμαστε αποφασισμένοι να κάνουμε αυτό το ντοκιμαντέρ πραγματικότητα.
Ας γράψουμε ιστορία μαζί
Γνωρίζουμε πολύ καλά ότι έχετε ήδη δει πολλά ντοκιμαντέρ για το Β' Παγκόσμιο Πόλεμο. Ξέρουμε επίσης ότι έχετε δει κι ένα σωρό ταινίες με ήρωες πολέμου, και ίσως κάποια φιλμ για ναυάγια.
Αλλά αυτή είναι μια ευκαιρία να αφηγηθούμε την ιστορία απλών ανθρώπων, που έκαναν εκπληκτικά πράγματα. Μια ιστορία ενός πληρώματος που αρνήθηκε να παραδοθεί, παρότι είχε την επιλογή. Την ιστορία του να υπερασπίζεσαι την πατρίδα σου, ακόμη και όταν κάθε ελπίδα έχει χαθεί.
Ας αφηγηθούμε αυτή την ιστορία στον κόσμο. Γίνετε υποστηρικτής τώρα! Αν δεν μπορείτε να συνεισφέρετε χρηματικά, τουλάχιστον μοιραστείτε αυτή την καμπάνια μέσω e-mail, Facebook ή Twitter!

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>The Creators</strong></h3>
<p>SOULFOOD STUDIOS, the production company of the feature documentary RUDE AWAKENING, is a new player on the market. Their vision is to create original high-end media content through great story-telling. They love to combine questioning the status quo with commercial entertainment.</p>
<p>JONATHAN KRAY, the main protagonist of this documentary has been directing music videos, ad campaigns, films and game cinematics for over 18 years. He worked as a cinematics director on the Emmy-award winning game Horizon Zero Dawn and sharpened his teeth as an editor, cameraman and animation director.</p>
<p>JORGE ANDRADE, his creative partner, brings a diverse background of experience in film, design and business. His curiosity for self-expression through the arts began at an early age studying and working as an actor in New Orleans and LA. Moving to The Netherlands' Jorge started a new chapter in his life and filmmaking.  </p>
<p>SANDRA ROGGERMANN, has been an essence coach and a community builder for many years until she became a producer. The expression and connection through the medium of film is an exciting new journey for her. Sandra will help the two directors bring together their vision  and help organise the interviews around the world. She will also write a book filled with all the interviewees wisdom together with Geoffrey Hoppe. </p>
<p>FRANK DUSKE made his comeback to the film industry after ten successful years in real estate development and building the German branch of a Hollywood film company that funded arthouse movies in excess of $250m. He completes the team as the film's operations and financial advisor.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Details</h3>
<p>This feature-length documentary is being produced on the same quality standard as productions seen on Netflix, HBO and Amazon Prime. The film will combine interviews, iconic film scenes and fun comedy moments into one cohesive narrative. For its production value it has a reasonable budget of € 1,2m ($1.36m) that includes the costs for pre-production, the trailers, the entire funding and marketing activities like press-tours and filmfestivals.</p>
<p>With a running time of approximately 90-100 minutes it will be shot in native 4k and released in the third quarter of 2020. We aim for a limited run in international theatres and a wordwide roll out on VOD platforms, such as Amazon Prime, Netflix, etc. and international film festivals.</p>
<p>A companion book with expanded interviews and insights will be written by authors Sandra Roggermann &amp; Geoffrey Hoppe.</p>
<p>The project budget consists of three major parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>€ 450.000,- through direct investments: we offer investors an opportunity to financially participate in the project, with all the risks, but also all the fun included.</li>
<li>€ 300,000,- through The Netherlands Film Production Incentive: this Dutch program supports the (co)production of feature-length documentaries with a cash rebate up to 35%</li>
<li>€400,000,- through Indiegogo crowdfunding (and that's you, folks!)</li>
<li>€ 50,000- through donations, that partly have already financed the pre-production</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, we're talking about a decent amount of money but this is not your typical ""singing-kumbaya--around-the-fire-story"". This documentary has the potential to reach a vast global audience and become a phenomenon for the simple fact that the story of self-discovery has never been told in a modern cinematic way.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Market</h3>
<p>In our market analysis we were not able to find any comparable movies to Rude Awakening. There are many movies that use a more mental and scientific approach and there are many documentaries that go deeply into the esoteric realms. </p>
<p>Documentaries describing spirituality tend to only focus on the self-discovery stages of “pre-awakening”, “awakening” and “spiritual seeking” and they can quickly become vague, righteous and preachy.</p>
<p>Documentaries using a more scientific and mental approach are able to communicate their story in a clear, everyday language but often get stuck in single truths, drama and concepts.</p>
<p>There are few that come close, for example Vikram Gandhi's ""Kumaré"" from 2011, or Tom Shadyac's ""I AM"" from 2010.</p>
<p>But a documentary that is related to our topic and combines humor with a contemporary visual cinematic style? None.</p>
<p>Rude Awakening will not only cover <i>all</i> the stages of self-discovery and how people live it in everyday life but it will tell this story in a <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>clear, fun and entertaining modern language.</span></p>

<h3>CHAPTER 1</h3>
<h4>JÁNANO - (Name of the mountain)</h4>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p>It is the genesis of this crusade. Jánano and Jananito are two mountains full of stories and mysticism to the Emberá peoples. Due to its height and geomorphology, these hills resemble an island that appears in the middle of the jungle and it is the home of unique species which inhabit its forested mantle. Guided by the few native indigenous who know the way to the top, this expedition, made up of biologists, geologists, herpetologists (those who study reptiles), and botanists, plunges into the immensity of the pristine forest with the firm intention of collecting samples which allow us to understand the true biodiversity to be found in this place.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The team formed by biologists María José Sanín, Saúl Hoyos, Camilo Flores, the geologist Juan Sebastián Jaramillo, the herpetologist Juan Manuel Rengifo and the conservationists Felipe Mesa and Francisco Acosta accompanied by Alejandro Acosta and Marcela Restrepo, will be guided by Poito, one of the few Emberá indigenous who knows the way. This 15-kilometer route through unknown territory will give us the opportunity to register a significant share of the biological diversity and floristic richness of this region.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On the first expedition performed to the Jánano mountain we analyzed the transformation of the landscape, which changes from a humid tropical forest on the lower zones, to the “andean” woods which are at the top, at 640 meters over the sea level. On this pathway 163 botanical samples were collected which belong to 153 species to be analyzed and studied. Up to know, three endemic species have been recognized, which currently are at the service of deep studies on behalf of science specialists. It’s hard work that continues its process and which starts to enlighten us about the extraordinary explosion of life that is hidden behind these magical mountains.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>CHAPTER 2</h3>
<h4>PUSA - (The sea in the Embera language)</h4>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p>The Pacific Ocean that bathes the shores of the Gulf of Tribugá is the second pillar of this crusade. This episode, more than evidencing the biodiversity of the Pacific, seeks to study and analyze its marine complexity and vulnerability, as well as the strong and direct connection of its ecosystems with important protected areas nearby such as the National Natural Parks of Gorgona and Malpelo, home of threatened species like the hammerhead shark. Through visits with marine biologists, oceanographers and expert engineers at sea, we seek to confirm how the arrival of the megaproject, port of Tribugá, puts at risk the delicate balance that converges within this place and also threatens the existence of a phenomena not yet fully understood as the migration and interaction of sardines, whales, sharks, dolphins and turtles among many others. In the long run these are of vital importance for the biodiversity’s balance and the livelihoods of the communities, who have found a way to give more long-term wealth from the conservation and sustainable use of these resources.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>PUSA recounts the explorations of three scientific teams: the Malpelo Foundation  led by marine biologist Sandra Bessudo -who study the migration of hammerheads between the Gulf of Tribugá and Malpelo Island-, the Macuáticos Foundation represented by the doctors Natalia Botero Acosta, Nohelia Farías Curtidor and Kerri Seger -who study the seasonal fidelity of humpback whales, their spatial distribution and behavior, as well as acoustically monitoring the Gulf of Tribugá-, and finally the team of teachers of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia and the Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana -who study the dynamics of the seas, analyzing their currents, temperature, salinity and doing mappings of marine ecosystems to build new coastal maps.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the studies mentioned above, advanced technologies will be used, such as: drones, underwater robots, satellites, hydrophones, transmitters, among others.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The information collected by these three teams of scientists is unprecedented, the viewer will be immersed in a journey that starts from the magic of hydrological cycles and ends with the relationship that exists between communities and the sea.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<h3>CHAPTER 3</h3>
<h4>PURU - (The village in the Embera language)</h4>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p>PURÚ is the ending of this crusade, where a group of psychologists, sociologists and anthropologists gather to reflect on how Indigenous and Afro-descendant peoples coexist with their environment, redefining the concepts of development, wealth and quality of life. It is through this accompaniment that sustainable ecosystems and alternative development models that highlight a unique balance are evident, where nature provides abundant food for all and nobody dies of hunger. These cultures are living examples which contrast with the desired economic interests of a few who consider the arrival of megaprojects as the true source of progress for the region.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Expedition Tribugá will take the public on an exciting journey through one of the most biodiverse and least explored regions of the world, passing through mysterious and unknown jungle mountains until reaching the vast deep blue of the Pacific Ocean where the largest mammals of the planet live. We will see how ancient cultures coexist in the midst of this exuberant nature and under the pressures that are found in the 21st century. This audiovisual project will gather a number of recent studies carried out by multidisciplinary specialists and will become a vital document to understand the magnificence of the Tribugá Gulf  and the urgency in sheltering it under a figure as a National Natural Park and / or World Heritage Site.</p>

</div><h3><strong>MOTIVATION</strong></h3><h4> </h4><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p>I still remember how, since I was very young, my curiosity about nature and the desire to understand different ecosystems grew every day. During college and at university I traveled constantly through Colombia, I crossed rivers and waterfalls, climbed mountains and went deep into the biodiversity of the jungles. The camera became my ally and with it I have always sought to convey the emotions that Colombian landscapes make me feel.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But there was something that changed my perception about the country, at the end of the nineties, I went for the first time to the Colombian Pacific. I was captivated by abundance and biodiversity; wherever I looked, I found life. It was in the middle of that ecstasy that I saw Cerro Jánano for the first time and was amazed by its majesty. It was so astonishing that I immediately began to inquire about the possibility of visiting it, however I only got discouraging answers, nobody dared to approach it because, they said, it was enchanted and it could be dangerous.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was on one of these trips when I met Francisco Acosta, co-director of this documentary series, he is another man in love with nature. He and his family have been living in the Chocó region for more than 7 years. Here, they have built an eco-hotel and a diving center, with which they seek to promote responsible practices in relation to these ecosystems. This relationship based on love and respect has opened for them a space within the community, and has been key for creating a very special bond between them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This is how Francisco and I joined with the firm intention to walk the area and truly get to know the infinite display of fauna and flora. Walking these places was how we met Poíto, an Emberá indigenous who would be the one in charge of taking us to the top of Cerro Jánano. Thus the first expedition accompanied by a team of interdisciplinary scientists was born, we seek to study and understand this wonder of nature. These findings are to be our arguments to turn this area into a protected area and shield it forever.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It was from this first expedition that we truly managed to understand the relevance of this place for humanity. A pristine tropical forest that is merged into the vastness and abundance of the Pacific Ocean producing an explosion of life, unique ecosystems and unparalleled biodiversity. The documentary series ""EXPEDICIÓN TRIBUGÁ"" was born out of a moral need to take care of this lung of the world and to prevent the megaprojects that are in the Colombian National Development Plan from reaching this paradise and modifying it forever.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The expeditions will study the Tribugá Gulf from 3 crucial points of view: the jungle, the sea and the community; a task that tries to highlight the importance of different ecosystems and their strong relationship with local cultures. We are aware of the titanic work that we face, however we are joining forces with important universities, organizations, scientists and local communities in order to raise awareness throughout the world and turn the Tribugá Gulf into a World Heritage Reserve.</p>

</div><h3> </h3><h3>CONTEXT</h3><p> </p><p>The idea of having access to the Pacific region from the department of Antioquia and from The Coffee Axis (Quindío, Risaralda, Caldas, North East of Valle and Northwest of Tolima) exists since 1880. But it was not until the decade of the 30s that the project began to gain strength, especially in the department of Caldas.</p><p> </p><p>With the boom in the 50s to give continuity to the Pan-American Highway in Colombia, the departments of the Coffee Axis and the Department of Antioquia were competing for who was advancing more in the project, as well as seeking for resources and permits with the Colombian state. For the Antioquia people the priority still is to unite Turbo with Tribugá and to connect the Urabá Antioqueño with the Urabá Chocoano by Guapá; while the Caldenses seek to concretize their road to the sea via las Animas.</p><p> </p><p>The lack of installed capacity of the Port of Buenaventura and the signing of different free trade agreements such as the Pacific Alliance, among others, has motivated the need to have a new port in the Colombian Pacific. For the promoter of the project, Archimedes S.A. terrestrial, the connectivity with the port is key, there could even be an oil pipeline that would take Venezuelan oil from Arauca to Tribugá, through a distance of 902.43 kilometers which would facilitate the output of this product to the Chinese market.</p><p> </p><p>The project was paralyzed for years, but it was revived during the presidential periods of Álvaro Uribe (2002-2006 / 2006-2010), and restrained again during the Government of Juan Manuel Santos (2010-2014 / 2014/2018) who was motivated by the signing and implementation of the peace agreements with the FARC guerrillas. With the arrival of Iván Duque’s Government, the project has taken on a new air. The feasibility studies performed by Archimedes S.A. began in January 2018, railway feasibility studies were carried out in September, and technical and operational construction analyzes are projected for the beginning of 2019.</p><p> </p><p>Currently there is a movement of social resistance trying  to prevent the construction of the port. Hotels that have fostered ecotourism and diving in the area have joined efforts making formal requests to the Colombian state and at the same time they’re finding support through virtual platforms that mobilize hundreds of thousands of people every year from all over the planet that vouch for this type of causes.</p><p> </p><p>Scientists, biologists and environmental professionals have studied and written academic papers  to support the immense environmental and social damage that will be generated in the area. Also, social leaders in the area have begun to express their nonconformity with the project, which has begun to generate threats to their lives and families by dark forces that seek to protect the economic interests of contractors and related companies. Felipe Mesa and Francisco Acosta - conservationists - as well as the team of Pavoreal join this fight by audio-visually demonstrating the magnificence of the place, its natural resources and people with a documentary series of 3 episodes that speaks about the jungle of the sacred mountains (Janano and Jananito), the ocean with its marine life and economic dynamism motivated by fishing and tourism, and finally its people, indigenous and afro-descendants who live in peace and harmony with their environment. Foundations, artists, professors, biologists and others  have gathered to make this documentary a reality that changes the perspective of citizenship and motivates them to mobilize against this environmental crime.</p><p> </p><h3>THE BIOGEOGRAPHIC CHOCÓ AND  TRIBUGÁ GULF</h3><p> </p><p>Chocó is one of the most diverse regions in the world, a unique place on the planet in terms of biological and cultural diversity; It is among the 25 regions of the world rated as priority for nature conservation. It has a very diverse biota, with great richness of plants, birds, reptiles, amphibians, butterflies, fish, marine and terrestrial mammals, as well as many species known and to be known. It is a region covered by dense tropical rainforests that have very little intervention, with high rainfalls, and a great racial and sociocultural diversity.</p><p> </p><p>The Gulf of Tribugá is located within the biogeographic colony, it is a unique place where the richness of the virgin forest and the abundance of the Pacific Ocean are mixed to create an ideal environment for the reproduction of many species.

</div><h2> </h2><h3> </h3></div>","CHAPTER 1
JÁNANO - (Name of the mountain)

It is the genesis of this crusade. Jánano and Jananito are two mountains full of stories and mysticism to the Emberá peoples. Due to its height and geomorphology, these hills resemble an island that appears in the middle of the jungle and it is the home of unique species which inhabit its forested mantle. Guided by the few native indigenous who know the way to the top, this expedition, made up of biologists, geologists, herpetologists (those who study reptiles), and botanists, plunges into the immensity of the pristine forest with the firm intention of collecting samples which allow us to understand the true biodiversity to be found in this place.
 
The team formed by biologists María José Sanín, Saúl Hoyos, Camilo Flores, the geologist Juan Sebastián Jaramillo, the herpetologist Juan Manuel Rengifo and the conservationists Felipe Mesa and Francisco Acosta accompanied by Alejandro Acosta and Marcela Restrepo, will be guided by Poito, one of the few Emberá indigenous who knows the way. This 15-kilometer route through unknown territory will give us the opportunity to register a significant share of the biological diversity and floristic richness of this region.
 
On the first expedition performed to the Jánano mountain we analyzed the transformation of the landscape, which changes from a humid tropical forest on the lower zones, to the “andean” woods which are at the top, at 640 meters over the sea level. On this pathway 163 botanical samples were collected which belong to 153 species to be analyzed and studied. Up to know, three endemic species have been recognized, which currently are at the service of deep studies on behalf of science specialists. It’s hard work that continues its process and which starts to enlighten us about the extraordinary explosion of life that is hidden behind these magical mountains.
 


 
CHAPTER 2
PUSA - (The sea in the Embera language)

The Pacific Ocean that bathes the shores of the Gulf of Tribugá is the second pillar of this crusade. This episode, more than evidencing the biodiversity of the Pacific, seeks to study and analyze its marine complexity and vulnerability, as well as the strong and direct connection of its ecosystems with important protected areas nearby such as the National Natural Parks of Gorgona and Malpelo, home of threatened species like the hammerhead shark. Through visits with marine biologists, oceanographers and expert engineers at sea, we seek to confirm how the arrival of the megaproject, port of Tribugá, puts at risk the delicate balance that converges within this place and also threatens the existence of a phenomena not yet fully understood as the migration and interaction of sardines, whales, sharks, dolphins and turtles among many others. In the long run these are of vital importance for the biodiversity’s balance and the livelihoods of the communities, who have found a way to give more long-term wealth from the conservation and sustainable use of these resources.
 
PUSA recounts the explorations of three scientific teams: the Malpelo Foundation  led by marine biologist Sandra Bessudo -who study the migration of hammerheads between the Gulf of Tribugá and Malpelo Island-, the Macuáticos Foundation represented by the doctors Natalia Botero Acosta, Nohelia Farías Curtidor and Kerri Seger -who study the seasonal fidelity of humpback whales, their spatial distribution and behavior, as well as acoustically monitoring the Gulf of Tribugá-, and finally the team of teachers of the Universidad Nacional de Colombia and the Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana -who study the dynamics of the seas, analyzing their currents, temperature, salinity and doing mappings of marine ecosystems to build new coastal maps.
 
For the studies mentioned above, advanced technologies will be used, such as: drones, underwater robots, satellites, hydrophones, transmitters, among others.
 
The information collected by these three teams of scientists is unprecedented, the viewer will be immersed in a journey that starts from the magic of hydrological cycles and ends with the relationship that exists between communities and the sea.
 

 
CHAPTER 3
PURU - (The village in the Embera language)

PURÚ is the ending of this crusade, where a group of psychologists, sociologists and anthropologists gather to reflect on how Indigenous and Afro-descendant peoples coexist with their environment, redefining the concepts of development, wealth and quality of life. It is through this accompaniment that sustainable ecosystems and alternative development models that highlight a unique balance are evident, where nature provides abundant food for all and nobody dies of hunger. These cultures are living examples which contrast with the desired economic interests of a few who consider the arrival of megaprojects as the true source of progress for the region.
 
Expedition Tribugá will take the public on an exciting journey through one of the most biodiverse and least explored regions of the world, passing through mysterious and unknown jungle mountains until reaching the vast deep blue of the Pacific Ocean where the largest mammals of the planet live. We will see how ancient cultures coexist in the midst of this exuberant nature and under the pressures that are found in the 21st century. This audiovisual project will gather a number of recent studies carried out by multidisciplinary specialists and will become a vital document to understand the magnificence of the Tribugá Gulf  and the urgency in sheltering it under a figure as a National Natural Park and / or World Heritage Site.
 


 

MOTIVATION 
I still remember how, since I was very young, my curiosity about nature and the desire to understand different ecosystems grew every day. During college and at university I traveled constantly through Colombia, I crossed rivers and waterfalls, climbed mountains and went deep into the biodiversity of the jungles. The camera became my ally and with it I have always sought to convey the emotions that Colombian landscapes make me feel.
 
But there was something that changed my perception about the country, at the end of the nineties, I went for the first time to the Colombian Pacific. I was captivated by abundance and biodiversity; wherever I looked, I found life. It was in the middle of that ecstasy that I saw Cerro Jánano for the first time and was amazed by its majesty. It was so astonishing that I immediately began to inquire about the possibility of visiting it, however I only got discouraging answers, nobody dared to approach it because, they said, it was enchanted and it could be dangerous.
 
It was on one of these trips when I met Francisco Acosta, co-director of this documentary series, he is another man in love with nature. He and his family have been living in the Chocó region for more than 7 years. Here, they have built an eco-hotel and a diving center, with which they seek to promote responsible practices in relation to these ecosystems. This relationship based on love and respect has opened for them a space within the community, and has been key for creating a very special bond between them.
 
This is how Francisco and I joined with the firm intention to walk the area and truly get to know the infinite display of fauna and flora. Walking these places was how we met Poíto, an Emberá indigenous who would be the one in charge of taking us to the top of Cerro Jánano. Thus the first expedition accompanied by a team of interdisciplinary scientists was born, we seek to study and understand this wonder of nature. These findings are to be our arguments to turn this area into a protected area and shield it forever.
 
It was from this first expedition that we truly managed to understand the relevance of this place for humanity. A pristine tropical forest that is merged into the vastness and abundance of the Pacific Ocean producing an explosion of life, unique ecosystems and unparalleled biodiversity. The documentary series ""EXPEDICIÓN TRIBUGÁ"" was born out of a moral need to take care of this lung of the world and to prevent the megaprojects that are in the Colombian National Development Plan from reaching this paradise and modifying it forever.
 
The expeditions will study the Tribugá Gulf from 3 crucial points of view: the jungle, the sea and the community; a task that tries to highlight the importance of different ecosystems and their strong relationship with local cultures. We are aware of the titanic work that we face, however we are joining forces with important universities, organizations, scientists and local communities in order to raise awareness throughout the world and turn the Tribugá Gulf into a World Heritage Reserve.
 

 CONTEXT The idea of having access to the Pacific region from the department of Antioquia and from The Coffee Axis (Quindío, Risaralda, Caldas, North East of Valle and Northwest of Tolima) exists since 1880. But it was not until the decade of the 30s that the project began to gain strength, especially in the department of Caldas. With the boom in the 50s to give continuity to the Pan-American Highway in Colombia, the departments of the Coffee Axis and the Department of Antioquia were competing for who was advancing more in the project, as well as seeking for resources and permits with the Colombian state. For the Antioquia people the priority still is to unite Turbo with Tribugá and to connect the Urabá Antioqueño with the Urabá Chocoano by Guapá; while the Caldenses seek to concretize their road to the sea via las Animas. The lack of installed capacity of the Port of Buenaventura and the signing of different free trade agreements such as the Pacific Alliance, among others, has motivated the need to have a new port in the Colombian Pacific. For the promoter of the project, Archimedes S.A. terrestrial, the connectivity with the port is key, there could even be an oil pipeline that would take Venezuelan oil from Arauca to Tribugá, through a distance of 902.43 kilometers which would facilitate the output of this product to the Chinese market. The project was paralyzed for years, but it was revived during the presidential periods of Álvaro Uribe (2002-2006 / 2006-2010), and restrained again during the Government of Juan Manuel Santos (2010-2014 / 2014/2018) who was motivated by the signing and implementation of the peace agreements with the FARC guerrillas. With the arrival of Iván Duque’s Government, the project has taken on a new air. The feasibility studies performed by Archimedes S.A. began in January 2018, railway feasibility studies were carried out in September, and technical and operational construction analyzes are projected for the beginning of 2019. Currently there is a movement of social resistance trying  to prevent the construction of the port. Hotels that have fostered ecotourism and diving in the area have joined efforts making formal requests to the Colombian state and at the same time they’re finding support through virtual platforms that mobilize hundreds of thousands of people every year from all over the planet that vouch for this type of causes. Scientists, biologists and environmental professionals have studied and written academic papers  to support the immense environmental and social damage that will be generated in the area. Also, social leaders in the area have begun to express their nonconformity with the project, which has begun to generate threats to their lives and families by dark forces that seek to protect the economic interests of contractors and related companies. Felipe Mesa and Francisco Acosta - conservationists - as well as the team of Pavoreal join this fight by audio-visually demonstrating the magnificence of the place, its natural resources and people with a documentary series of 3 episodes that speaks about the jungle of the sacred mountains (Janano and Jananito), the ocean with its marine life and economic dynamism motivated by fishing and tourism, and finally its people, indigenous and afro-descendants who live in peace and harmony with their environment. Foundations, artists, professors, biologists and others  have gathered to make this documentary a reality that changes the perspective of citizenship and motivates them to mobilize against this environmental crime. THE BIOGEOGRAPHIC CHOCÓ AND  TRIBUGÁ GULF Chocó is one of the most diverse regions in the world, a unique place on the planet in terms of biological and cultural diversity; It is among the 25 regions of the world rated as priority for nature conservation. It has a very diverse biota, with great richness of plants, birds, reptiles, amphibians, butterflies, fish, marine and terrestrial mammals, as well as many species known and to be known. It is a region covered by dense tropical rainforests that have very little intervention, with high rainfalls, and a great racial and sociocultural diversity. The Gulf of Tribugá is located within the biogeographic colony, it is a unique place where the richness of the virgin forest and the abundance of the Pacific Ocean are mixed to create an ideal environment for the reproduction of many species. The best known phenomena is the migration of humpback whales, which come every year to the Pacific coast, especially to the Utría inland park (Within the Gulf of Tribugá) to mate and give birth to hundreds of calves. Like them, there are many species (turtles, sharks, whale sharks, other species of whales, thousands of fish and many more that we do not know yet) that come to this specific place to breed or feed. The importance of this place is transcendental at a national but also a global level, since the species that are born in the Gulf of Tribugá can reach any region of the world.BUDGET  What has been expected to be collected in the crowdfunding campaign will be directly addressed to the costs of the last expedition and completion of the filming that will take place during the month of May 2019.*All amounts are in COP  TEAM

<h3>PEATER</h3>
<p>PEATER centres around a teenage boy who is struggling with Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa. This film intends to reflect the struggles men, with eating disorders, face in today’s society.  This film will show Anorexia Nervosa’s effects on a person’s mental and physical health and how many of them deal with their issues by isolating themselves, especially from society and as a result worsens their situation. </p>
<p>The film PEATER is about the life of a young man named Peter in his early 20s . Peter has been isolating himself  from friends and family for a while. His friends think that the reason for Peter's behavior was the recent death of his mother, but the real problem something else and Sarah who is Peter's close friend, is the only person to understand it. Will Sarah be able to help Peter before it gets out of hand?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>RAISING AWARENESS</h3>
<p>What is the first gender that comes to mind when talking about anorexia? İsn't it a woman? Yes it's true, the first gender that comes to mind when anorexia is mentioned is female, which is why this disorder is known as a female disorder in society. Therefore, men avoid calling for help. Until recently, men did not receive the necessary help for eating disorders for a number of reasons.</p>
<p><strong>The reasons for this are:</strong></p>
<p>The individual does not notice his own symptoms</p>
<p>Professionals' bias against male eating disorders</p>
<p>Considering eating disorders as women's disorders</p>
<p>Designing eating disorder clinics in hospitals for women</p>
<p>Eating disorders have different symptoms in men than in women</p>
<p>For these reasons we can say that today’s society gives more importance to women with eating disorders. The best example for this could be the movies that are made focusing on this topic. Until today many movies have been made related to eating disorders, but most, if not all, of these movies were about women rather than men.</p>
<p>This is what we aim to change. We are doing a fundraiser not only to raise money for our film, but to try and change the perception that we, as a society, have around eating disorders. We want to show that it is not only a woman’s disorder but that many people struggle from this and that this disorder does not conform to a gender as it affects people of all ages, genders, backgrounds etc.  We are trying to raise awareness not only for the eating disorder itself but primarily eating disorders in men.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In order to create this short film we are looking to raise 2000 pounds. The film can only be made with your help and the support you make. </p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By helping us you will also help to raise awareness to the society of men who are struggling with eating disorders. Between 1.25 and 3.4 million people in the UK are affected by an eating disorder, around 25% of those affected by an eating disorder are male.  By reaching out to this target audience we are helping them on their road to recovery. You might think  ''How can a movie possibly change the perception we have as a society? ''.  Well, through making this movie we are aiming to reach out to not only those who are suffering with eating disorders, but their family and friends too. Additionally, this will help them to recognize any symptoms they might display. </p>

The Impact
By helping us you will also help to raise awareness to the society of men who are struggling with eating disorders. Between 1.25 and 3.4 million people in the UK are affected by an eating disorder, around 25% of those affected by an eating disorder are male.  By reaching out to this target audience we are helping them on their road to recovery. You might think  ''How can a movie possibly change the perception we have as a society? ''.  Well, through making this movie we are aiming to reach out to not only those who are suffering with eating disorders, but their family and friends too. Additionally, this will help them to recognize any symptoms they might display.

<li>I'm a young female writer/director with a proven track record of starting projects, approaching them realistically, and above all, finishing them.</li>
<li>Containment will be made using a camera that has literally just been released: the RED Komodo, a new top-of-the-line palm sized digital cinema camera that keeps pace with its big-boy counterparts.  A few of my industry buddies got their hands on an early-release version of this camera, and they were impressed enough with this project to let me use it (thanks guys!)</li>
<li>This project is attempting special effects we're pretty sure have never been seen on screen before. We’re putting the darkest paint in the world, Black 3.0, to the test on screen as a new form of practical effect. It absorbs 98% of all light that hits it, which definitely makes it a substance worthy of outer space. </li>
</ul><h2>COVID Risks &amp; Challenges</h2><p>Filmmaking is challenging on a good day. These challenges are made even more difficult by the fact that we're making a film during a global pandemic. These things may seem daunting, but they're quite surmountable. Here's our plan:</p><ul>
<li>All our on-set plans have been vetted by an emerging infectious disease expert</li>
<li>All cast and crew must be tested 3 days before shoot</li>
<li>The crew is limited to 10 people</li>
<li>We're routinely sanitizing all gear/surfaces</li>
<li>We're making sure everyone is masked whenever possible</li>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: center;"">We attempted preproduction for an even lower-budget production of Private Languages several months ago but quickly came to realize just how reliant the impact is on a higher level of professionalism, i.e. money spent in a few essential categories. </p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: center;"">After careful calculations, the following necessities must comprise our budget in order to achieve the vision for this film and meet standard guidelines of any movie-making process:</p>

<p>While filming outdoors in an uncontrolled area allows us to attain optimal setting for this particular story, securing the impeccable sound necessary for overall effect becomes more difficult – yet never impossible - to achieve. This requires a highly skilled Sound Location Mixer with exquisite equipment – an imperative service whose $500 fee is top priority in our budget, aside from transportation and meals &amp; craft.</p>

<p>As you already know, Covid-19 makes all things much more difficult, and in this case, more expensive. Subways, public transportation, and carpools of any kind are not encouraged per the New York State Film blah blah. Private transportation is the new industry standard. Therefore, every crew and cast member who don’t already share a household will require their own taxicab, twice a day, for the three days we have booked to shoot.</p>

<p>As it is illegal to set up tents or tables on the sidewalk; water, coffee, beverages, and snacks will flow bountiful from the rental car which will be kept close. Because of lack of access to kitchens, indoor spaces, trailers, tents, and our own tables, our per person cost for food and drink includes take-out and store-bought packaged snacks and beverages. Individual meals will be ordered ahead of time by our PA and scheduled meal breaks will take place at the tables in lovely, nearby, outdoor Bryant Park.</p>
<p>As for our restroom and handwashing stations, I have a relationship with a neighborhood business which allows us access by purveying their shop for ample craft service items and paying a fee.  </p>

<p>What is art if it can’t be seen? The consciousness of an artwork comes not only from its creator but from the minds of its audience. Art needs to be experienced. Films need to be seen.

<p><strong>LIGHTING</strong> - The vision of this film utilizes available natural light in lieu of professional to get the sharp contrasts and mercuriality of the wild sun – and it also keeps costs lower. </p>

After another in an endless series of bomb threats forces the evacuation of their Manhattan office building, Rebekah and Leif, two estranged workplace lovers, struggle to connect while wandering the pre-apocalyptic midtown streets.
Rebekah has a deepening sense of isolation, feeling threatened by the world and people who are blithely indifferent to danger. Is this why she disappeared for a workweek and two weekends from both her job and Leif?
Leif is undeniably connected to Rebekah, understanding the isolation and fears that plague her. But his base humor has begun to push reality – and Rebekah – further away. It keeps him strangely safe…
until…
her confession of a plaguing dream reveals the missing link to a private language they have shared all along.

An investigation into how our sense of helplessness in the face of completely possible catastrophes changes us - Private Languages examines how we handle this panic within ourselves and in the arms of others.
The narrative is fairly linear, in the realm of the absurd, and very intimate. The style has elements of noir, neorealism, experimental, and new wave. Private Languages is a story seen through the eyes of someone who has felt alone for too long.

<h3>About The Film</h3>
<p>The best films come from real life.  This one is no exception. Short version: I met a Romanian cam girl when I was 17. We became fast friends, eventually started a romantic relationship. The rest of it was a story I'm not quite ready to tell yet. To answer it briefly, she dumped me after what was possibly the most stressful year of my life, and most likely hers as well.  However, in the middle of this chaos, I wrote <i>I. Love.You. </i> Based off an argument I had with my ex-girlfriend, this film answers an essential question in the digital age of modern romance and a time when mental health issues and difficult complex relationships are more prevalent than ever, ""What happens when a relationship gets <i>real?</i>"" The answer isn't quite so simple, but I. Love. You. is a film that encapsulates exactly what those seven special letters and three little words mean, in more ways than one.</p>
<h3>The Crew</h3>

<p>Brian Cheng is a current fourth -year student at NYU’s Tisch School Of The Arts. Born and raised in the suburbs of Northern Virginia, his influences span a range of filmmakers, musicians, photographers and writers, ranging from David Fincher, John Hughes and Sam Raimi to Billie Joe Armstrong Of Green Day and NYC's own Beastie Boys. However, the best way to describe his work, as a close friend once said is “Punk, Slice Of Life with a pinch of Revolution”, an apt description for a guy who can belt out the lyrics to “American Idiot” on cue and whose clothes consist mostly of band merch, cargo shorts, hoodies, and backwards baseball caps. In his spare time, he enjoys eating pizza, cheeseburgers, steak and  listening to as much music as he can get his hands on, spending time with his girlfriend, family and friends,  and talking to the myriad of people that live in the Big Apple. </p>

The best films come from real life.  This one is no exception. Short version: I met a Romanian cam girl when I was 17. We became fast friends, eventually started a romantic relationship. The rest of it was a story I'm not quite ready to tell yet. To answer it briefly, she dumped me after what was possibly the most stressful year of my life, and most likely hers as well.  However, in the middle of this chaos, I wrote I. Love.You.  Based off an argument I had with my ex-girlfriend, this film answers an essential question in the digital age of modern romance and a time when mental health issues and difficult complex relationships are more prevalent than ever, ""What happens when a relationship gets real?"" The answer isn't quite so simple, but I. Love. You. is a film that encapsulates exactly what those seven special letters and three little words mean, in more ways than one.
The Crew
Brian Cheng Writer/Director

Brian Cheng is a current fourth -year student at NYU’s Tisch School Of The Arts. Born and raised in the suburbs of Northern Virginia, his influences span a range of filmmakers, musicians, photographers and writers, ranging from David Fincher, John Hughes and Sam Raimi to Billie Joe Armstrong Of Green Day and NYC's own Beastie Boys. However, the best way to describe his work, as a close friend once said is “Punk, Slice Of Life with a pinch of Revolution”, an apt description for a guy who can belt out the lyrics to “American Idiot” on cue and whose clothes consist mostly of band merch, cargo shorts, hoodies, and backwards baseball caps. In his spare time, he enjoys eating pizza, cheeseburgers, steak and  listening to as much music as he can get his hands on, spending time with his girlfriend, family and friends,  and talking to the myriad of people that live in the Big Apple.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>UNSAVED will be the next short film by Massachusetts based filmmaker J.L. Carrozza. June (Sissy O'Hara) is a narcissistic older woman who leads a very self involved life. One day a mysterious man (Adam LaFramboise) shows up at her door, claiming to be the Devil himself. What follows is a hellish nightmare as she is tormented and haunted by this demonic figure.</p>
<p>Carrozza, a 33 year old filmmaker and professional video editor, has been making mainly horror based film projects since he was a teenager. His current project is a series of short horror films called BLACK OMNIBUS.  His latest short, FUNGUS, is the first in the series and is currently having a successful film festival run, UNSAVED is the second.</p>
<p>FUNGUS was an apocalyptic horror film with stark black and white cinematography, by contrast, UNSAVED will be a supernatural horror film in vibrant color.</p>
<p>Carrozza is a huge fan of genre cinema from Asia and Europe. Italian horror films such as the original SUSPIRIA (1977) and the <i>Drop of Water </i>segment in Mario Bava's BLACK SABBATH (1963) are particular inspirations for this new project UNSAVED.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With UNSAVED, the funds will go toward what's onscreen (mainly extensive set decorations and the elaborate costume and makeup for Lucifer's final form) along with keeping the cast and crew well fed and paid.</p>
<p>As we are a small film production collective, we cannot get too elaborate with expensive to produce consumer perks and most of this fund is going towards our film. Nonetheless, we do have some perks to offer. Anyone who donates $5 or more will get their name mentioned in the credits. Other perks include early access to FUNGUS well before it's released online and UNSAVED before it starts its film festival run, copies of the FUNGUS and UNSAVED scripts autographed by members of the productions and souvenir props used in both movies.</p>
<p>Even if we do not meet our goal, production will still proceed and perks will still be honored.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We believe in producing material that's off the beaten path. We also strive to make technically well produced content outside of the orbits of Los Angeles or New York (for now) and are always pushing to produce better and better quality work. A donation toward this project is a donation toward the kind of unbridled independent cinema that Hollywood doesn't really take a chance on anymore. The city of Boston has a vibrant and talented film community and by giving to this project, you're giving welcome financial support to an interesting and colorful group of creatives.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As director, I have a history of completing my projects, but independent filmmaking is an inherently risky venture with zero guarantees and it is certainly possible principal photography and post production could drag out longer than expected.</p>
<p>There are a couple of risk factors that could lead to this especially weather. We are filming in February and New England is prone to snowstorms at this time of year. There's always the chance a cast or crew member may not be able to fully commit due to unexpected scheduling conflicts or creative differences. A few people needing to be replaced could add extra time to the production. As said though, campaign being successful or not, we're still going into production and it is very likely we will have a close to finished film or at least a rough cut by June 2020. I understand that it is a director's job to be a problem solver and rationally navigate through the uncertainty and controlled chaos of getting a group of people together to make a movie.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that <i>anything</i> helps. A donation of even a dollar is valued for the thought.</p>
<p>What is also highly valued is spreading the word. We are far more likely to meet our goal if this campaign is put in front of thousands of eyes. So if you honestly cannot donate, share, share, share on every social media platform. Share the link on Facebook, Twitter (use #unsavedmovie), Instagram, Pinterest, Reddit, Tumblr, etc. Tell your friends and tell them to tell their friends. Thank you for your interest in this project and in the kind of movies Gen-Y Films likes to make.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a young woman from Lahore, Pakistan. The Women's March, known locally as the Aurat March (the word 'aurat' meaning 'woman' in Urdu), has inspired me to document the current significant period in the history of the Women's Movement in Pakistan.</p>
<p>Since the first Aurat March took place in 2018, the movement has grown substantially. Hostility towards the marches is pervasive. The organisers receive rape and death threats, but these threats are met with the unwavering bravery and determination of the women campaigners.</p>
<p>This project is close to my heart having grown up in Lahore and witnessed this new form of activism. The Aurat March marks a unique moment in Pakistan's history. By making this documentary my intention is not to vilify Pakistan to overseas audiences, but to highlight the country's progress, by filming the women taking it forward. This film also aims to dispel stereotypes of Pakistani women as helpless victims.</p>
<p>Your contributions will help this film portray the courage and resilience of Pakistani women.</p>
<h3>Funding</h3>
<p>The production phase for this film will require £26,500. This is for hiring production equipment such as cameras, lights, mics; salaries for those on the production team; sound and music rights; graphics; travel expenses.</p>
<p>Even if the fundraising goal is not reached, I will continue fundraising elsewhere in order to reach the entire goal and make this film magic! However, if very little funds are raised, I will donate them to the 2021 Aurat March.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>In the light of the unending news of the rape, torture and murders of women throughout the world, but spiking recently in South Asia, I believe it is crucial to document the women campaigners in Pakistan who stand up to the male establishment. According to Thomson Reuters Foundation, Pakistan is the sixth most dangerous country in the world for women. Therefore, the fight for change is more important than ever. And that change is happening here and now.</p>
<p>I also intend this documentary to contribute to the discourse on the women’s movement locally and worldwide. The Aurat March reflects the new paradigm the world is witnessing in the wake of the MeToo movement whose effects have reverberated globally. I intend this documentary to contribute to the discourse on the women’s movement locally and worldwide.</p>

<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>Hello everyone. Thank you for taking the time to watch the video above. If you've skipped it, here's the rundown. We're making a short film called 'an actor prepares'. Thank you to everyone who's helped us along the way but if this is news to you and want to help us out, please read on.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>an actor prepares</h3>
<p>Written and Directed by Theo Hristov</p>
<p>Dan is a young actor who's just about to make his professional theatre debut. Lead role. One of the better fringe theatres in London. Someone's seen a Mr. Bradley Cooper milling at the bar? It's a big deal. Yet Dan's also trying to cope with his grief in the immediate aftermath of a personal tragedy. Isolate it. Bottle it. Banish it. As opening night closes in, Dan must decide if he's ready to let go of the ghosts of the past or let them dictate his future. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div><h3>So we're building this thing...</h3></div><div>
<p>Our journey with the film started off very, like major, like ultra, like super low-key when Theo jotted down a ten-page first draft in long hand on a rainy afternoon in the bar at the BFI Southbank. Then he put it in a drawer and forgot about it. </p>
<p>We've come a long way since then and the film has only grown in both scope and ambition. It's a very personal, intimate narrative about a person who is dealing with mental health issues only heightened by the fact that's he's an actor and all the complications and uncertainties that arise from that sort of a lifestyle. So he has to learn to walk that tightrope. The short film is a distillation of a feature-length script. Setting it over a single day, we're trying to mine that soft spot where a person's personal and professional lives collide and what the consequences are.</p>
<p>Being an actor might seem easy and glamorous from the outside but it's a job that places an enormous weight on your mental health, especially when you have to say, don that Santa suit and go work in a place like Hamleys over Christmas to afford that luxury. You cut yourself off from family and friends and possibly won't make that dinner-date in two weeks' time because you might finally book that acting gig you went in for yesterday even though you haven't booked anything yet. But you might. And when you do and all seems well and you strike that balance of career and family just right then something unexpected, something darkly funny, usually happens and disturbs the peace. Shatters everything to pieces. </p>
<p>That's where Daniel finds himself, right in the middle of this conflict. He's booked the gig. But his personal life's come undone. He's grieving. He's a wreck on the inside. And even if all he wants to do is stay in bed and cry, if the script calls for him to be laughing when he goes on stage, he'd better start laughing. Well first of all he'd better go on stage. And still the stage provides an escape from his real life. It's the only place where he feels totally whole and safe and at home. </p>
<p>So however dark the concept might seem, what the film ends up being, what it aspires to be is a love letter to the stage. And to acting. And to all the folks who keep doing it just because they love it. Even in the face of adversity. </p>

<p>Theo is an actor and writer.</p>
<p>Born and raised in the idyllic setting of post-communist Bulgaria, he came to London to read economics and finance where he spent his school years engaged in such odd jobs as tugging luggage and running the lift in a now notorious West End hotel. Burdened with student debt and disillusioned with corporate finance, he illogically decided to forego a cushy job in the City and finally made the move to the stage. Recent credits include <i>Beast</i> and <i>There Is a War</i> at the Southwark Playhouse.</p>
<p>Theo has also written a number of full-length plays, shorts and one-acts and he's performed his own work at venues like the Old Red Lion, Pleasance and YAT Islington and Southwark Playhouse. As he's writing this in the third person, he's also just realising that he's spent a hell of a lot of time in the London Borough of Islington but he's not posh so don't hold this against him. He's currently developing his first feature - i.e. sitting in a café scrolling through Twitter to see if people like him. <i>an actor prepares</i> will be his debut short film as a writer-director.</p>

<h3>The only money guide you'll ever need</h3>
<p>Making a film, however big or small, whatever its budget level, is a massive undertaking.

<p>Through pulling a lot of favours we've been able to cut costs on everything without compromising the quality of what we're making. We've assembled a team of artists - both cast and crew - who've jumped at the chance to be involved in this project because they believe in our vision and in the story we're trying to tell. </p>
<p>What we don't want to compromise is the way we treat those same artists and how artists are generally treated in our industry. So we want to set an example even on such a low-budget production as this one. We want to be able to pay everyone involved for their hard work and dedication. </p>
<p>Here's where you come in. The money we raise will play a vital role in paying everybody involved in the three-day shoot and any production expenses that we incur in the process shooting on location from securing our locations and transportation of cast, crew and equipment down to buying us some lunch.</p>
<p>Any little bit helps.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>'I've always depended on the kindness of strangers.'</h3>
<p>A huge thank you for all your support. It means the world to us. </p>

<p>Spread the word out there, tell everyone you know that this is happening and how they can contribute and share. We can't STRESS this enough. Get it? Stress? But in capital l... Forget it. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello!  My name is <strong>Nicole Gianuca</strong> and I am in my final semester of film school at the New York Film Academy (Los Angeles).  In our final semester, we are tasked with writing, producing and starring in a five-minute thesis film -- something I've dreamt of doing my whole life. </p>
<p>My film is a comedy about a young dentist, Julia, with a struggling new practice who receives a new neighbor -- a loud, quickly successful kick-boxing studio owned by the super-peppy Kevin.  The story follows the beginning of their relationship as neighbors as Kevin's loud, energetic beats frazzle Julia's last nerves!  </p>
<p>This story is something that I conjured up a couple of years ago while I was working as a receptionist at a dental office that had -- you guess it-- a sometimes too-loud kick-boxing studio next door.  Although it is a comedy, it touches on subjects that I consider important to us all, such as helping a stranger in need without prompting, and lifting your head out of the cloud of your own problems to see the people around you.  </p>
<p>Any contribution you can make to my campaign would be appreciated beyond words.  Not only would you be helping me to finish my bachelor's degree, but you'd be helping me achieve a goal that I've had since I was a young girl! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Naturally, as a student, my budget is the biggest obstacle I face in completing my thesis film.  Any contributions made will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>locations</li>
<li>crew</li>
<li>equipment (such as light kits, etc.)</li>
<li>transportation and food for cast and crew</li>
<li>film festival entree fees</li>
</ul>
<p>Not only will your contributions help me to complete my project and achieve my dream, but there are <strong>perks</strong> for you too -- from copies of the final film to invitations to screenings and more.   <strong>Any help you can give is greatly appreciated!</strong> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Contributing to my campaign will help me to achieve a dream that I've had since I was a young girl.  This film is a culmination of my life experiences and my growth and education as a story teller.  </p>
<p>Although I have chosen to write a comedic short, this story dives into topics that I find extremely important to us all.  This story explores how often we are so overwhelmed with our own complicated lives and struggles that we can't see the people around us -- people who might even be able to help.  It also explores what it is to be the person to offer the helping hand to someone we might not even know that well without prompting or promise of ""personal benefit."" </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>A first time filmmaker? Sound kinda risky, right?  </p>
<p>Right now, my biggest challenge with my project is funding -- something <strong>you</strong> can help me with! I have written, produced, directed and performed my own material before (in theater) and your contribution will help me to take my work to the next level, as well as to fund food, transportation and locations. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p>
<ul><li>
<strong>Spread the word! </strong>It would mean the world to me if you could simply share my campaign with your friends and family.  </li></ul>

Although I have chosen to write a comedic short, this story dives into topics that I find extremely important to us all.  This story explores how often we are so overwhelmed with our own complicated lives and struggles that we can't see the people around us -- people who might even be able to help.  It also explores what it is to be the person to offer the helping hand to someone we might not even know that well without prompting or promise of ""personal benefit."" 

Risks & Challenges
A first time filmmaker? Sound kinda risky, right?  
Right now, my biggest challenge with my project is funding -- something you can help me with! I have written, produced, directed and performed my own material before (in theater) and your contribution will help me to take my work to the next level, as well as to fund food, transportation and locations. 

Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:

Spread the word! It would mean the world to me if you could simply share my campaign with your friends and family.  
And that's all there is to it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>A LIFE WORTH LIVING: A DOCUSERIES</strong></p>
<p>A year ago my life completely changed. I remember looking up from the dinner table. Arms crossed and in a daze. The words came across my ears but they didn't register.</p>
<p><i><strong>""Did you see the Facebook Live of the kid in my class who killed himself last night?""</strong></i></p>
<p>What?  What did you just say?</p>
<p>A kid from high school killed himself and streamed it on Facebook?</p>
<p>I couldn't bring myself to watch.</p>
<p>As I step back and listen, I hear more. This conversation became one person. And then another. Then another. Then another.</p>
<p>They were 17 years old. They were 15 years old. Then they were 11 years old.</p>
<p>As I started to pay attention, I started to ask questions.</p>
<p><strong>What in the hell is going on?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why is this happening?</strong></p>
<p>Instead of simply questioning, I sold the last of what I own - packed up a backpack, purchased some film gear and decided to do something more. </p>
<p>I want to ask those at the ground floor what in the hell is going on and why are more people not talking about this silent epidemic. You see this project is not simply for adults. It is a project from concept that is focused on being appealing to our core audience - <strong><i>TEENS between 11-19 years of age. </i></strong></p>
<p>For the next 30 days you will are being invited to help contribute to a new docuseries titled <i><strong>A Life Worth Living. </strong></i>The focus of this project is to showcase the stories of communities, families and those directly impacted by the devastation of teen suicide.</p>
<p>We need your help and can't do this alone.</p>
<p>We want to shine a light on something that is being swept under the rug.</p>
<p>This topic deserves more time than a feature documentary allows. Thus we are focused on a multiple show approach allowing us the freedoms and opportunities to showcase more stories, people and discussions without bias.</p>

<p><strong>YOUR SUPPORT</strong>: <strong>Our goal is to raise $30,000 in 30 days.</strong></p>
<p>With your help, we can secure the financing needed to meet our production costs while completing the first few episodes of the series. Our goal is to get the first 3 episodes finished while shopping for a distribution deal on a major streaming or television platform. The more eyes we can get on the project, the more people we can help and stories we can share. </p>
<p><strong>Here is what your contributions will go to:</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to minimize the expenses it takes to get this project done by utilizing the skills, experience and network our team has in place today. The following are things that allow us the opportunity to really scale and add a level of professionalism needed to pull a full team together for this powerful project. </p>
<strong>TRAVEL: </strong>We are traveling across the United States to interview people and meet with those in their home environments. This allows us the opportunity to capture a unique look from the ground floor. We will be driving for most of the travel and staying in hotels, campgrounds and with friends along the way. This will also cover a small per diem for food and fuel expenses.<p><strong>POST PRODUCTION: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Color Correction</strong>: Color grading and color correction is an essential part of post-production. We've edited footage from an array of formats, and qualities. We need to make sure that there's a visual consistency throughout the film. This is very technical and lengthy process and it makes the difference between an amateur and a professional look.</p>
<p><strong>Sound Editing:</strong> To make this film, we will be using a variety of footage and need to assure we have a unified and balanced sound that allows us to tell the story in a way that is captivating and keeps viewer attention. Sound editing is an indispensable part of film making and it is just as essential as picture editing.</p>
<p><strong>Original Score:</strong> Music is important. As we look at original music we are also working with various artists and labels to assure a relevant soundtrack is aligned to the audience. Layering the right sound and sounds will be crucial in tying this project together and making it relevant. </p>
<p><strong>Animation</strong>: To enhance the visual storytelling, we want to have some animation to illustrate various aspects of the story. The dreamy and surreal animation we have tested is the perfect element to elevate this project beyond realism.</p>
<p><strong>Festival Submissions:</strong> Alongside our efforts for major syndication we will be working with the festivals to gain awareness. As you may or may not know, festival submissions are expensive. We have a goal to get this project screened in festivals around the United States and abroad for the 2020 festival season. </p>
<p><strong>Footage Licensing:</strong> Much of the material we are gathering is our own. There will be some footage needed that belongs to some talented people and we want to make sure we can pay them a license for their footage.</p>
<div>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div> <strong>Risks &amp; Challenges: As with any project, money is the linchpin. </strong>
</div><div>
<p>The team has been working on this project for over a year. We are ready to fully launch awareness and continue the interviews needed to finish the first aspects of the series. We can't finish without your help! </p>
<p>Our goal is to complete a full docuseries that encompasses 10 episodes for the first in a series. To do so we need the proper financing to complete our production needs which include an original soundtrack, animation, sound editing, color correction and a budget for festival submissions. We are so close and know together with the community we can reach the finish line for this important project.</p>
<p><strong><i>**** DISCLAIMER: If we do not reach our goal, we will be still leveraging funding raised to start this project. We believe in the power and importance of this message and will push through production as we can.

<ul>
<li>Over 50 percent of all people who die by suicide suffer from major depression. If one includes alcoholics who are depressed, this figure rises to over 75 percent.</li>
<li>Depression affects nearly 5-8 percent of Americans ages 18 and over in a given year.</li>
<li>More Americans suffer from depression than coronary heart disease, cancer, and HIV/AIDS.</li>

Our crew consists of University of Kansas film and media upperclassmen who have previous experience in making narrative shorts, documentaries, experimental films, music videos, corporate videos, and more. Putting together all of that experience, and months of pre-production, we feel ready to take the next step and try our hand at shooting a feature length film. </p><p>The Sound of Your Voice is a romantic-thriller that centers around a linguistics student named Benjamin who is adrift in life, unsure of a direction to take his research. But, after stumbling upon a young woman named Ave and offering her a chance to be one of his test subjects, the two begin a romantic relationship. Ultimately though, his damaging lifestyle and insecurities turn the fluttering romance into an unhealthy obsession.</p><p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p><p>In order to tell our story with as much truth and production value as possible, we are looking to raise $8,000. This money is going to fund our principal photography in and around the Lawrence, Kansas area. Every dime we get is being put back into the film towards things like paying for talented cast and crew, set decoration, costumes, meals and other miscellaneous expenses that come with shooting a feature film. In the event we don’t reach our goal of 8k, we will still be using the money we have to produce a shorter version of the same film; so every little bit counts!</p><p>For your generosity, we wanted to give something back to our supporters! To the right of the screen you will see the incentives we have available for those who donate.

Our crew consists of University of Kansas film and media upperclassmen who have previous experience in making narrative shorts, documentaries, experimental films, music videos, corporate videos, and more. Putting together all of that experience, and months of pre-production, we feel ready to take the next step and try our hand at shooting a feature length film. The Sound of Your Voice is a romantic-thriller that centers around a linguistics student named Benjamin who is adrift in life, unsure of a direction to take his research. But, after stumbling upon a young woman named Ave and offering her a chance to be one of his test subjects, the two begin a romantic relationship. Ultimately though, his damaging lifestyle and insecurities turn the fluttering romance into an unhealthy obsession.What We Need & What You GetIn order to tell our story with as much truth and production value as possible, we are looking to raise $8,000. This money is going to fund our principal photography in and around the Lawrence, Kansas area. Every dime we get is being put back into the film towards things like paying for talented cast and crew, set decoration, costumes, meals and other miscellaneous expenses that come with shooting a feature film. In the event we don’t reach our goal of 8k, we will still be using the money we have to produce a shorter version of the same film; so every little bit counts!For your generosity, we wanted to give something back to our supporters! To the right of the screen you will see the incentives we have available for those who donate. These perks range from having your name in the end credits, a cast/crew signed script sent to your home, to being named an Executive Producer on the film, and more! Meet the CastJelani Talib - Benjamin Jelani went to Longview Metropolitan Community College in Lee Summit, Missouri, but mainly networked outside of school for more acting opportunities. He has been acting since High School after his theatre teacher asked him to audition for the school play. Once he got the part and became familiar with the breakdowns of a character and scene analysis, Jelani fell in love with acting! His most memorable role was playing Carlton in the new Bel-Air trailer that was shot in Kansas City, Missouri. Check out his reel below!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbD6g496HMw&amp...Raelin Searcy - Aveline Raelin is a nineteen year old actor from Kansas City, MO. She began theater acting inmiddle school, and transitioned to film after graduating high school in 2018. She takesacting classes with Dan Compo at the Commercial Actors Studio, as well as helps withthe kids’ class at the studio. When she is not acting, she likes to fill her time singing andplaying piano or ukulele. One of her biggest goals in life is to be a guest on Jimmy Fallon.  Chloé Ryan - Devin Chloé Ryan is a Junior at the University of Kansas studying Theatre Performance with minors in Dance and International Studies. Originally from Tulsa, Chloé has been in numerous student short films, as well as having worked on set of indie feature film “Golden Arm,” as a Bakery Patron and Super Fan this summer, directed by Maureen Bharoocha. She is signed to Exposure Model and Talent in KC and BK Talent based out of OKC and has appeared in two commercials for James B. Nutter. Her favorite thing about acting is getting to explore all the different relationships humans have with each other. She is super excited about joining this team and getting to work with so many talented students!John Scherschligt - LucasJohn first got into acting in high school when he began taking acting classes and performing in school productions. After high school, John went on to KU where he was lucky enough to find some friends that also enjoyed making films.

<p>Hello and welcome to the INCREDIBLE film that is Miva &amp; Reed. </p>
<p>Miva &amp; Reed is the title of our Senior Thesis Capstone Project -- an experimental narrative that takes on the concept of identity (specifically gender and sexual identity) by examining the lives of two individuals. Two close friends, Miva and Reed are in their early twenties and are at the start of their rising professional careers. Miva is training to become a professional swimmer, but is struggling with a detrimental injury. Reed is an aspiring fashion designer but is struggling with his sexuality and accepting the idea that he may be attracted to another man. To cope with their identity crises and to express their mental and emotional frustration, the duo commits MURDER. It’s a story about running away. Running away from your problems, emotions, confusion, uncertainty, anxiety and most of all, running away from your fears. Both Reed and Miva are struggling with entering their adult lives, while dealing with incredible personal hurdles that are keeping them from achieving all that they want. </p>
<p>This film means a great deal to us for so many reasons and we need your help to make it as amazing as it possibly can be. This film is the culmination of our past four years of education at Ithaca College and we are asking for $3000 to help fund the extraordinary story of Miva &amp; Reed. This story draws from two themes that are extremely important to us as filmmakers and as people (LGBTQ issues &amp; female empowerment). The film industry is a field dominated by white males. This is why this story is so important and needs to be told. Our primary crew members are made up of two INCREDIBLE women &amp; two AMAZING members of the LGBTQ community. </p>

""How to Get Someone To Love You"" aims to reaffirm the value of love from a parent to a child as a consequence of unintended neglect in pursuit of resolving many of life's other pressing issues. At the same time, this film seeks to give voice to people in search of their own sexuality, identity and place in the world. 
A personal story with experiences on what it is like to have someone who will work their entire life just to provide for you, but at the same time, forget to be physically and emotionally there, this is a film that shares the awareness on the unconditional and unseen love from our parents. This is a film that teaches us to cherish what we have.

<li>Contributors can look forward to a hyper realistic take on crime drama, told by a local filmmaker.  At <strong>Headc8se Films</strong> we strive not just to create great movies, we want to share subjective, cinematic experiences with the audience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Just €15 from a thousand contributors gives us our entire budget! We all love Irish films and at <strong>Headc8se Films</strong>, we love making them.  You can contribute for as little as €1.  There are a number of perks available, from on screen credits, joining the crew on set to becoming an Executive Producer.  Every amount will help us achieve our goal and enable us to produce an amazing piece of work.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Although we have won an award through the Screen Directors Guild of Ireland (SDGI) and the Arri Alexa take 2020, we still don't have a green light. We need production insurance, a number of key crew members that are not included in the award, cast, extras and catering during principal photography.  Not to mention props, vehicles and fake blood. We also need to cover post-production that's before even looking at delivery, sales, marketing and festival entry fees.</li>
<li>Our target is €15,000 for the production of <strong>THE LAND OF BANG</strong>. That includes all stages of production from concept to creation.</li>
<li>There is a number of gifts a contributor can avail of, depending on the contribution you wish to make. Are you a patron of the arts, an executive producer, do you want tickets, a poster or simply want to observe a film being made? Anything is possible depending on how generous people feel.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal of €15,000, we will have to make compromises that in turn, will soften the standards we are striving to achieve. But this won't happen, we have a lot of faith in ourselves and we hope you do too.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>THE LAND OF BANG</strong> is a local story that will be shot on location in the community of Sheriff Street, directed by Patrick McDermott. The backdrop adds verisimilitude but most importantly, raises important questions of a young mans struggle when affiliated with a gang. Why must innocent lives end just because of gangland violence? This has happened time and time again. Stopping for a while, then starting all over. What is going on? Although fictional, <strong>THE LAND OF BANG</strong> could possibly shed light or provoke discussion within reality.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have directed a number of short form projects and still doing it today. I've worked with most broadcasters and numerous production companies, but myself and the team have decided to take <strong>Headc8se Films</strong> to the next level. We want to produce our own content that strives to test our boundaries.</li>
<li>So donate today dudes and we thank you all in advance.</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Public school classrooms are microcosms of the world at large. Their ecosystems are where our students learn to live and learn and work in community with one another. <br/> </p>
<p>I'm Melissa Lukenbaugh, documentary filmmaker and photographer having wrestled 15 years of humanitarian stories throughout Africa, Southeast Asia and most favorably Tulsa, Oklahoma.</p>
<p>In 2017, I began working on a historical documentary to celebrate the 100th year of Oklahoma's oldest elementary school, Lee School, founded in 1918. That summer, in Charlottesville, VA, white nationalists marched in protest of the removal of the Robert E. Lee statue standing since 1924 leaving one person dead and dozens injured. </p>
<p>On the eve of the 100th anniversary of Lee School, the protest came to Tulsa. One of the city's most solid public elementary schools made great by community volunteers for 100 years now underwent an identity crisis. A figure symbolizing the Confederate South also identified a school touting 100 years of public service, education for all, commitment to community and exceptional citizen leadership. The unique and remarkable diversity that Lee School enjoyed for a century is now put to her highest call yet.</p>
<p>This intimate look at how Tulsans grapple with legacy, threats to an already fragile public school system and national political conversation begs the question if our current climate of polarization is as binary as our media outlets portray. </p>
<p>Does a name change do the real work of equity insurance? Are our divisions really defenses of color lines or class or could it be something else? Are we more tethered and united in unlikely relationships than we realize?</p>
<p>As the name of the school changed, the community and the families who walk through the doors each day are still trying to determine if, in fact, progress was made. </p>
<p>In this effort, we ask the question. </p>
<p>To support the completion of this film is to reject the one-liner journalistic approach to this history. To take a fuller, deeper view into the complexities of a misguided debate. To question what polarizes us through the lens of  a public school family wrestling their identity between politics, class, race, and personalities.</p>
<p>As we set out to record each moment of this year, I encouraged crew members to ""look for the light"" and I believe we did that. We reached for what beauty motivated the intentions of each voice.  </p>
<p><strong>We need $25,458 to complete this film. </strong>We have completed the shooting for 95% of the project.  The remaining footage gathered will be a call to the question of progress and we invite you to reach out to us if you'd like to speak to this question. Have we made progress? </p>
<p>To date, the crew has been paid in full. We'll use the funds raised to conduct the additional interviews, purchase 2 additional hard drives and complete post-production: 2 editors, director, color grade, music/composition, sound mix and insurance. </p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, we will edit the footage we have and complete the film without proper color grade and sound mix rendering the project short of perspective and quality finish but honest in record. If we do reach our goal, the chronicle of 100 years of Lee School in documentary form will be realized as well as the multiple layered narrative of her 100th year as Council Oak Elementary.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This project has been nearly three years in the making. We have hundreds of hours of BRoll, archival material and interviews with Lee School Alumni from nearly 100 years ago through each generation. It will take the Tulsa community to bring it to the finish line. Traditionally, we have fumbled around when attempting to talk honestly about political challenges, our public school funding record and our past. We simply don't know what or how to say.  This project aims to defy assumptions about who believes and fights for what and why ... to slow division, slow the rhetoric and clarify the narrative enabling us to see each other as individuals with unique experiences rather than classified groups.</p>
<p>Our risks are the vulnerabilities required to tell this story. We simply want to provide a safe place for people to talk about a vulnerable topic in our city.  We can't guarantee cooperation but we promise to seek out the founding good in everyone and promote a heroic tale of hard fought progress.</p>
<p>Our challenges are technical. Time and money. This far, I've sunk personal funds into the project as well as too much business time. I need the help of a team now. It is the only way forward and through. </p>

<h3>What is this? <br/> </h3>
<p>This is the Indie-A-Gogo for Brooklyn Battle Comedy's short film ""Brooklyn Battle Comedy: We Make Movies"" </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>...And what is Brooklyn Battle Comedy? </h3>
<p>Brooklyn Battle Comedy is your stop for locally-sourced, cage-free, ethical comedy and wrestling extravaganza brought to you by two idiot what they're doing. Brooklyn Battle Comedy is real outlaw mudshow bull!@#$. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Uh...</h3>
<p>We're a comedy show run by stand-up comedians Benel Germosen and Lawson Leong. Starting in New York in 2019, Brooklyn Battle Comedy is a hybrid comedy and wrestling show that brings together stand-up comedians and professional wrestlers under one roof. Comedians do jokes and then wrestlers wrestle <i>sans ring</i>. It originally started in the back room of a LGBTQ bar, Brooklyn Battle Comedy wishes to continue to expand to greater and greater heights. What better way to do that than a movie?!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>There are much better ways to do that</h3>
<p>Yeah, but this movie is a passion project for us. It is our way of betting on ourselves and our goofy little show. In Brooklyn Battle Comedy, we believe in few things; We believe that stand-up comedy and professional wrestling are both artforms are unfairly maligned by elements within and without our industries. We believe that stand-up comedians and professional wrestlers are both exploited by their respected industries in significant ways that pulls power away from the people who create the art and puts in the hands of people who gatekeep and curate the art. We believe that stand-up comedians and professional wrestlers (as well as other performances artists) are entitled to the fruits of their labor. Brooklyn Battle Comedy is made by artist for artists, to share in their love of art in these two seemingly disperate forms. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Alright, so what do you need? </h3>
<p>We are asking for money to help us fund our project. Our goals are simple and realistic. We only ask for enough money to cover part of the production cost, specifically handling the cost and expenses of hiring the performers. We have budgeted comfortably to afford our director, editor, audio production, sound equipment, props, health and safety, and location. Our need is two fold: We would like to pay our performers as soon as filming is done and we would like to be able to show the film in festivals. For that we need to raise capital to support our two fold plans of paying our artist quickly and submitting to festival. We hope with your help, we'll be able to do that. <br/><br/> </p>
<h3>Sounds good, but what are the risk</h3>
<p>Films are percarious endeavors in the best of time. In the era of Covid, these risks are further compounded by sudden changes in our world state. While we are doing the utmost when it comes to health and safety, we do not know what tomorrow may bring in the shadow of the Coronavirus. In the likelihood that one of our crew is informed, we will be forced to shut-down production. There is no consciousable reason to continue to shoot a film if even one of our six person team get sick. Furthermore, we will be conscious of any and all government effort to stem the tide of Covid infection. Meaning if there is another lockdown in place, it will be unlikely we will be able to finish the film. There is a chance, as with any film, that the project could fall apart. We remain optimistic about these risks and believe in making this film. </p>
<p>That said, we're not stupid. We're gonna wear masks unless we're in front of a camera for a scene. <br/> </p>
<h3>Alright bruh, but I'm like v broke. How can I support without giving you money? </h3>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The beautifully filmed docudrama, The Students of Umberto Primo,  brings to life the stories of nine young Jewish students studying at  the Italian school, Umberto Primo, in Thessaloniki, Greece, during the time of Nazi occupation. The project is the result of a discovery by  Antonio Crescenzi of students’ essays, graduation diplomas, and other  documents of historical importance, that had been long forgotten in the  basement of the Italian Institute of Thessaloniki (formerly the location  of Italian School of Umberto Primo). Sadly, these students never  received their graduation diplomas, or their papers, because of Nazi  persecution. Thanks to Crescenzi's discovery and subsequent work, 157  diplomas were presented to survivors and/or their families in January  2017.</p>
<p>It is so important now, perhaps more than ever, to remember history, and what can happen when fanatic ideology, nationalism, racial and ethnic discrimination overtake societies, and the human tragedy that ensues. By remembering, we not only honor the victims, but also hopefully prevent these events from happening again.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Overall, we need $200,000 in additional funding to complete this ambitious film project. Filming is already underway, and we are now raising funds for post-production work and distribution.</li>
<li>Get your name in film credits! Get an all-expenses paid trip to Greece for the premier! Get VIP premier tickets! These are just some of the perks and rewards for certain tiers of backing.</li>
<li>All funds raised go directly to support the filming, post-production and distribution of the film.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>When we think about today's political and social climate, against particularly the backdrop of a global pandemic that should and could have united all of us against a common enemy, the messages and stories of this film become all the more poignant. The film is especially relevant in the US, with our large Greek, Italian and Jewish diaspora.</p>
<p>Our Indiegogo campaign follows a successfully funded Kickstarter campaign, as well as a hard-working team working diligently on private fundraising endeavors and grant-seeking proposals. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Filming, fundraising and overall continuity during COVID-19 has been particularly challenging, especially considering the profound economic impact the crisis has had on individuals. We are extremely sensitive to this, and in fact are living it ourselves. But....we made the decision to forge ahead anyway. We are a group of hard-working, dedicated and passionate individuals who believe in the power of film to transform, inspire and move people. There are no contributions that are too small. It will take the power of many to be part of this, and we are grateful for every gesture of support.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute monetarily, we understand! But please--show your support by sharing this campaign using the Indiegogo sharing tools. You can also view/share our website link (<a href=""http://www.thestudentsofumbertoprimo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.thestudentsofumbertoprimo.com</a>); share the film's trailer, and use your social media networks to spread the word and build our audience.</p>
