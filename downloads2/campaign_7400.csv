<p><span>My project is to release my very first artbook featuring the best and my favourite artworks from 2011. It will be 8x10 and full colour with many images inside. I am doing all the layout myself to save costs and having it printed with Kablam.</span></p>

HISTORICAL
Glass has a long history in Germany, largely as factory
work; recently due to machine-production, many studios have shut down. In Germany,
Erwin Eisch (b. 1927) in Frauenau, a small town in the Bavarian
Forrest, played a major role in the Studio Glass movement in the 1960ï¿½s. Eisch had a tremendous impact on Harvey
Littleton, and later in 1988, he opened the Bildwerk Summer Academy in Frauenau.
YOUNG
The contemporary glass art movement is still young (50 years old next year!) and
finding new innovations all the time. Glass is an artform tied to invention and
everyday you can learn something new with it. When Berlin Glas e.V. opens, it will be the first art glass
studio ever in Berlin! 
LOCATION
The contemporary Glass movement is international and
Berlin is a major hub for European artists to advance or begin their work in
this material, as well as artists from further away. Berlin Glas e.V. exists in a
place that could serve many artists without an alternative in neighboring
countries and beyond. 
INTERNATIONAL
Already the studioï¿½s founding members is a collaboration of
Americans, Germans, Canadians, Australians, and Lebanese; and by some of the biggest, up and
coming names in contemporary glass. This year, in November, Tim Belliveau and Phillip Bandura of the Bee Kingdom collective in Canada moved to Berlin to help founder and director Nadania Idriss make this project come into fruition. This is a team with
years of combined experience in management, programming, technical ability and
art practice. 
and now we invite you to be part of this special project, too!

<p>The New Poetry Festival 'Poetas en Nueva York’ reaches its eighth edition and reaffirms through the art of words, the presence of the Latin American community in the United States. The dates to hold this event are from November 29 to December 1 of the present year. Readings will take place in different Hispanic-content libraries where you can enjoy the different styles and techniques of the guests. All events are free to the public.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The purpose of the festival is to generate dynamics that contribute to the dissemination, creation and development of artistic expressions in order to promote integration and construction of alternative spaces and the enrichment of cultural diversity.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>The goal</strong></h2>
<p>We need to fundraise $2000 for the expenses of more than 30 poets who will be joining us through this journey.</p>
<p>With your donation, you will be supporting a group of enthusiasts who make of culture, a vivid activity for the Hispanic community in New York. This group, with more than eight years of organizing events in the city, has become a cultural reference. This effort, from our perspective gives us the satisfaction of total independence. </p>
<h2><strong>The Impact </strong></h2>
<p>We invite you to join an epic work. The many events we offer during the year confirm our commitment and quality. The Cultural Marathon, open mics such as ""The Other Side"" and the local newspaper <em><span>Vecindad</span></em>, make ‘Poetas en Nueva York’, a guaranteed wager that your contribution will be reflected in a festival without reference in the world.</p>
<p>With your support you are making sure that these artists can bring their work and words to mingle and grow with the big city and in exchange the public will get to experience art from different countries and from latinos who reside in New York.</p>

<p>The West Port has seven bookshops, one bindery, two vintage clothes shops, one rum club and much more. It's a lively literary quarter just below Edinburgh's castle. It's also an area best known for its strip joints.</p>
<p><strong>With this festival, we want to promote the area's bookish assets at a time when booksellers and other independent shops need all the help they can get! </strong></p>
<p>The WEST PORT BOOK FESTIVAL offers <strong>free events</strong> to a broad audience that shares our passion for books, bookshops and fun.

<p>Allison Guinn, <a href=""http://www.progressivetheatreworkshop.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">PTW Associate Artist</a> and Broadway performer (Hair), needs to go to Seattle to take part in Seattle Autoharp Week to hone her skills (<a href=""http://www.seattleautoharpweek.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.seattleautoharpweek.com/</a>). An investment in her is an investment in our artistic base. We are calling on friends of PTW as well as personal friends of Allison's to make this a reality for her and us in a very short period of time. </p>
<p>Allison Guinn originates from Erwin, Tennessee, a small mountain town in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains, but finds her home in New York City. She has been all over the place with the most recent incarnation of <em>Hair </em>(Shakespeare in the Park, Broadway, West End, First National Tour), and got to be on HBO briefly as Al Capone's companion of choice. She loves the part of humanity that's a little off but a little funny at the same time and hopes to create theatre pieces that reflect that. If its important, she graduated from Circle in the Square Theater School and East Tennessee State University. She enjoys vintage clothing, playing the autoharp, and singing like Hazel Dickens.</p>

<h3><strong>What We Need</strong></h3>
<p>We need $1500 dollars to cover the costs of the retreat which includes boarding and meals as well as airfare costs to get her there. All donations are tax deductible through our 501(c)3.</p>

<h3>What exactly is 25 Days?</h3>
<p>25 Days is a project born out of a desire to make a difference. Listening is the key to unlocking the doorway to compassion.

<p>Over the course of a year (the project is<a href=""http://www.25daysus.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""25 Days""> already underway</a>!), Spike will travel to 15 cities and spend 25 Days in each city. While in each city, Spike will meet with people at the place they love the most in their city, have them explain why they love it, and why it is meaningful to them. Spike will write the stories on the project blog and, at the end of the project, she will compile the images and stories into a special limited edition book. </p>
<p>Our stories unite us. When we can share them and feel the impact of understanding certain universal truths, compassion replaces fear, and love replaces hate. </p>
<p>This project operates on the premise that we are all connected and that each one of us has an inspiring story to tell.</p>

<h3>Money at Burning Man ??????</h3>
<br/>The Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert presents an excellent ground to begin rethinking values. During that moneyless week in the desert the Exchanghibition Bank will confront the participants: a confrontation, which might introduce the possibility of a transition into another frame of thought, turning that week into more than just a week void of currency.<br/><br/><img align=""none"" alt=""booth in desert"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i251.photobucket.com/albums/gg314/dadara/booth-desert.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 460px; height: 241px;""/><br/><br/>We are planning on popping up every day at a different unexpected location, which will add another layer of meaning to this project and every time will question those values of art and money. <br/><br/>Dadara has built some big interactive art projects in previous years as well, such as the <a href=""http://www.dadara.nl/sculptures-and-installations/Fools-Ark"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Fools Ark</a>, a wooden threemaster shipped from the Netherlands to the Nevada desert and then burnt, the <a href=""http://www.dadara.nl/sculptures-and-installations/burning-greymen"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Burning Greymen</a>, an altar surrounded by 140 paper mache Greymen, and <a href=""http://www.dadara.nl/sculptures-and-installations/dreamyourtopia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Checkpoint Dreamyourtopia</a>, a border control checkpoint to enter your own Dreams.<br/><br/><h3>Spiritual Karma Laundering Contract</h3>

</div></div>","Exchange the World!Amsterdam based artist Dadara started a new bank - the Exchanghibition Bank - in times when governments spend billions on preventing banks from falling, but those same governments are cutting back drastically on the Arts. A project which raises questions about the value(s) of Art and MoneyThe bank already has popped up at various spots in Amsterdam. In cultural venues, such as Paradiso and the Nuit Blanche festival, but we also did some Guerilla Banking in the main hall of Amsterdam Central Station, where we provided visitors with the opportunity to exchange their euros for our banknotes of Zero or One Million.Recently we introduced our new banknote - the Infinite one - and presented the very first banknote to Larry Harvey, founder of Burning Man, which is based on a gift-economy and where money doesn't exist. And we did that in the Magna Plaza shopping center, which seems rather based on shop-till-you-drop! (Photos HERE)And now we are going to bring Banking to Burning Man.........

Money at Burning Man ??????
The Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert presents an excellent ground to begin rethinking values. During that moneyless week in the desert the Exchanghibition Bank will confront the participants: a confrontation, which might introduce the possibility of a transition into another frame of thought, turning that week into more than just a week void of currency.We are planning on popping up every day at a different unexpected location, which will add another layer of meaning to this project and every time will question those values of art and money. Dadara has built some big interactive art projects in previous years as well, such as the Fools Ark, a wooden threemaster shipped from the Netherlands to the Nevada desert and then burnt, the Burning Greymen, an altar surrounded by 140 paper mache Greymen, and Checkpoint Dreamyourtopia, a border control checkpoint to enter your own Dreams.Spiritual Karma Laundering Contract
Obviously no real money will change hands in the desert. We will gift the money to visitors, BUT only after our bankers have discussed the values of Art and Money with them AND only after those visitors have signed the required 'Spiritual-Karma-Laundering-Contract'. Every transaction will be an interaction as well.

We would love to be able to finance all with our Infinite amounts of money, but......

unfortunately that won't work. We made what we think are amazing suits, which gradually transform from painting overalls into pinstripe suits, printed the banknotes, and all of them are numbered and have details printed with silverfoil, and built an exchange booth out of glass, metal and mirror.And now we'll even have to spend more money in order to transport all to the States and the desert, so we are asking you to help us. 
And in return you could become a Millionaire or even get to own an Exchanghibition Bank suit of your own!

<p>The concept derives from ‘Expanding Theater’, the
idea that the whole world can be seen as a stage – <i>Theatrum Mundi.</i> This idea was mentioned by Honoré de Balzac in reference to his book<i> La</i> <i>Comédie Humaine
</i>and can be traced back at least as
far as back as Shakespeare’s line, “All the world’s a stage’’. </p>

<p>By supporting
our project not only you give us the opportunity to realise our dreams and make public
spaces become alive but also to broaden up our artistic network and be able to embrace
artworks from various art forms that share the same principals. We hope that <i>Re-Inventing Public spaces</i> will inspire
emerging artists to make work in public and create an umbrella of public
actions. <b>We want to transfer the message that artists don’t have to wait
institutions, theatres and galleries to accept their work</b>, but inspired by
Grotowski’s idea of ‘Poor Theatre’ and the movement of ‘Arte Povera’, props and
stages aren't essential to make work <b>simply because the city landscape is
our scenography and our concepts are our props!</b></p>

</span>After we chose the specific location of the
performance we popped into the shops around asking for permission to use their
balconies or windows to allow us to shoot from higher up and thus having a
wider angle for the shooting. Most of the shops told us that they are not
allowed even themselves to use their windows due to health and safety reasons
and they seemed unwilling to help. Some others which are bigger, it seems
impossible to get the chance to speak to the manager as they are always busy on
meetings. </p>
<p>They advised us to ring them and I was waiting on the line for 15 min
to hear that the manager isn't at the store at the moment. I am planning to
spend the following Mondays there which is a quieter day and get to convince
them to allow us to shoot from their stores. The other problem is that in late
June that we want to run this project, the sale period starts in Oxford circus
so some of the shops even if they really wanted to support us they ended up
saying no because we were going to interfere with their customers. If things
get any worse, we will have to change the location and ask more shops and
hopefully get permissions. </p>

<p>·<span> 
</span>We asked for permission from the Westminster council
to shoot on a public space and awaiting their response. Last year with <i>Breakfast</i> we didn't ask for permission and
we had no trouble whatsoever but I reckon now that we'll have 26 performers
screaming permission seems necessary. </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>We have spread the call out for performers in every
possible mean that is free and accessible. Until now we have confirmed 8 Women in Red ! </p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>We are asking friends to introduce us to some
cinematographers that are interested in the project and getting in touch with
them. Hopefully the campaign will go well and I can offer them some money. The
problem when there is no money involved is that people often disappear and it
happened to me to have a performer disappear one minute before the show!</p>

After Breakfast in London Bridge that went viral (!) on Twitter we are delighted to announce our
new Site-responsive project in Oxford Circus starring Women in Agony,
Women in Agony is a
cross artistic collaboration between Eliza Soroga (Performance Artist) &

This performance makes a comment on how fashion industries

As this project will work both as live and film we
need your support to hire the equipment needed (cameras, microphones) and bring
3 cinematographers with a strong sense of the aesthetic of the image to work
with us using
different angles and heights providing a complete coverage of the live action.
Of course we also need 16 identical outfits (dresses, wigs, shoes, tights and
plain shopping bags) to be able to create the illusion of the unanimous crowd. Most important is that by supporting this project you also encourage us to continue working hard as we
won’t feel alone anymore as we go through it! 
Help us Re-Invent Public spaces
Women in Agony is part of the artistic initiative Re-inventing Public spaces -performance art
series which look at the city landscapes as scenographic references to make Site
Specific/Responsive work that works both as live and film. 
We observe London’s
busy public locations as visionary theatre stages to make site work by
incorporating the reality of the chosen sites. We aim to re-invent the city’s
outdoor spaces and as artists to provide ‘imaginary windows’ to its citizens for
escapism and daydream where fiction and reality interact and merge.

The concept derives from ‘Expanding Theater’, the
idea that the whole world can be seen as a stage – Theatrum Mundi. This idea was mentioned by Honoré de Balzac in reference to his book La Comédie Humaine
and can be traced back at least as
far as back as Shakespeare’s line, “All the world’s a stage’’. 


By supporting
our project not only you give us the opportunity to realise our dreams and make public
spaces become alive but also to broaden up our artistic network and be able to embrace
artworks from various art forms that share the same principals. We hope that Re-Inventing Public spaces will inspire
emerging artists to make work in public and create an umbrella of public
actions. We want to transfer the message that artists don’t have to wait
institutions, theatres and galleries to accept their work, but inspired by
Grotowski’s idea of ‘Poor Theatre’ and the movement of ‘Arte Povera’, props and
stages aren't essential to make work simply because the city landscape is
our scenography and our concepts are our props!

After we chose the specific location of the
performance we popped into the shops around asking for permission to use their
balconies or windows to allow us to shoot from higher up and thus having a
wider angle for the shooting. Most of the shops told us that they are not
allowed even themselves to use their windows due to health and safety reasons
and they seemed unwilling to help. Some others which are bigger, it seems
impossible to get the chance to speak to the manager as they are always busy on
meetings. 
They advised us to ring them and I was waiting on the line for 15 min
to hear that the manager isn't at the store at the moment. I am planning to
spend the following Mondays there which is a quieter day and get to convince
them to allow us to shoot from their stores. The other problem is that in late
June that we want to run this project, the sale period starts in Oxford circus
so some of the shops even if they really wanted to support us they ended up
saying no because we were going to interfere with their customers. If things
get any worse, we will have to change the location and ask more shops and
hopefully get permissions.

· 
We asked for permission from the Westminster council
to shoot on a public space and awaiting their response. Last year with Breakfast we didn't ask for permission and
we had no trouble whatsoever but I reckon now that we'll have 26 performers
screaming permission seems necessary. 
· 
We have spread the call out for performers in every
possible mean that is free and accessible. Until now we have confirmed 8 Women in Red ! 
· 
We are asking friends to introduce us to some
cinematographers that are interested in the project and getting in touch with
them. Hopefully the campaign will go well and I can offer them some money. The
problem when there is no money involved is that people often disappear and it
happened to me to have a performer disappear one minute before the show!
 

Budget Breakdown

26 x red dresses (£20 each) = £520

<div></div>L’art ne doit pas demeurer confiné dans les murs, réservé à un groupe d’initiés. C’est pourquoi la Fonderie a, depuis ses débuts, investi l’espace public afin de démocratiser l’accès à l’art contemporain, pour tous. Parmi nos projets phares, on compte <i>Panique au Faubourg </i>(1997), <i>SilophoNe</i> (2001) et <i>Plan large</i> (2001-2010). </div>

<h3 style=""font-family: 'robotoboldcondensed', Arial Narrow, AvenirNextCondensed-Regular, Liberation Sans Narrow, Arial;"">Notre projet</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p></p>Depuis 8 ans, la Fonderie Darling aménage chaque été une place publique sur la rue Ottawa. Cette place devient un lieu de rassemblement des gens qui habitent et travaillent dans le quartier, un lieu de destination pour les touristes et les citoyens curieux de découvrir une expérience unique et inusitée. Des discussions sur l’art, des performances et des street partys y sont organisés
 tout l’été. À terme, nous souhaitons que cette place devienne 
permanente, soit animée à l’année et qu’y soient aménagées des œuvres 
créées sur mesure pour les lieux.<div>

<h3 style=""font-family: 'robotoboldcondensed', Arial Narrow, AvenirNextCondensed-Regular, Liberation Sans Narrow, Arial;"">Été 2015</h3>Nous avons besoin de votre aide pour permettre l’installation cette année de <i>Mirador</i>, une œuvre spectaculaire du Collectif Acapulco qui prend la forme d'une montagne schématisée s'étendant sur une grande surface de l'immeuble faisant face à la Fonderie Darling. Une entrée aménagée à la base de la structure permettra de pénétrer à l'intérieur de ce fragment de paysage et d'en arpenter les entrailles afin de profiter du point de vue exceptionnel offert par le promontoire situé au sommet. Ceux qui font l’ascension de la montagne s'exposent ainsi à une perspective tout à fait différente sur le décor environnant. 
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434998729/q9mksp3rvl9kit7eodcm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>Mirador</i>, avec son esthétique brute rappelant les chantiers de construction, est le résultat d'une réflexion autour du paysage, du factice, des jeux d'échelle et de l'espace public.</p>

<p>Nous faisons donc appel au public <b>pour nous aider à amasser les 25 000$ nécessaires à la production et la mise en place de l’œuvre, de même qu’à l’animation de la place publique</b>. Si nous dépassons notre objectif, les fonds excédentaires permettront à la Fonderie de consolider son organisation de façon à pouvoir pérenniser son action dans le quartier. <br/></p>

</p>
<p>Depuis quelque temps, les artistes et les organismes à but non lucratif (OBNL) subissent des coupures de financement sans précédent, et leurs activités en sont durement touchées.

<p>The Darling Foundry is a visual arts centre located in the heart of Old Montreal in Cité du Multimédia. Its mission is to support the creation, production, and dissemination of visual artworks. Several renowned artists have rented a studio or exhibited their works at critical moments of their career, including Brian Jungen, Valérie Blass, Anthony Burnham, Mathieu Beauséjour, Stan Douglas, and Jana Sterbak.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 style=""font-family: 'robotoboldcondensed', Arial Narrow, AvenirNextCondensed-Regular, Liberation Sans Narrow, Arial;"">Our Vision</h3>
<div>
<p>Art must not remain confined within the walls and be reserved to a group of insiders. Which is why since its foundation, the Foundry has invested in the public space to democratize access to contemporary art for all. Its flagship projects include <i>Panique au Faubourg</i> (1997), <i>Silophone</i> (2001), and <i>Plan Large</i> (2001-2010). </p>

<p>For 8 years, the Darling Foundry has launched its public space every summer on Ottawa Street. This place has become a gathering community for people who live and work in the neighborhood as well as a destination for tourists and citizens interested in discovering a unique and unusual experience. Artistic performances, discussions on art and street parties are held all summer long. Our ambition is to make this public place permanent and alive all year long, inhabited by tailor-made visual artworks.</p>

<p>We need your help to install <i>Mirador</i>, a spectacular work from the art collective Acapulco, this year. This piece takes the form of a mountain extending over a large surface of the building facing the Darling Foundry. An entry on the base of the structure delves inside a segment of the landscape and allows visitors to survey the depths and take advantage of the exceptional point of view offered by the headland located at the top. Those who manage to ascend the mountain are thus exposed to quite a different perspective of the surrounding scenery.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>Mirador</i>, with its raw aesthetics, recalls construction sites and is the result of a reflection around the landscape, the artificial, the scale effect, as well as the public space.</p>
<p></p>

<p>We are thus appealing to you <b>to help raise $25,000 needed for the production and installation of this artwork, as well as for the animation of the public place</b>. Any additional amount raised will enable the Foundry to consolidate its organisation so as to sustain its action in the area.<br/></p>

</div></div>","L’œuvre présentée dans la vidéo ci-dessus, SORTIR de l’artiste Aude Moreau, a été réalisée durant 2 nuits en 2010 sur la tour de la Bourse de Montréal. Il s’agissait là d’un projet monumental, rare et très périlleux, un message d’art public fort qui transcendait tout ce qui avait été fait jusque là. C'est ce genre de projets que la Fonderie Darling souhaite continuer de mettre de l'avant sur sa Place Publique.
Un document photographique à édition limitée de l'œuvre Sortir a été réalisé à partir du Pont de la Concorde et nous a gracieusement été offert par l’artiste dans le cadre de la présente campagne. Un exemplaire sera remis aux donateurs qui contribueront à la hauteur de 1000$ au projet Mirador.

Si vous n’avez pas eu encore l’occasion de contribuer à la campagne, il demeure possible de le faire jusqu'au 27 août prochain, date de la grande fête que nous organisons pour remercier les donateurs. Chaque dollar excédentaire amassé nous permettra de consolider notre organisation de façon à pouvoir pérenniser notre action dans le quartier. Vous pouvez donc encore faire toute la différence sur la suite des choses. Merci encore!
**

If you did not have the opportunity yet to contribute to the campaign, it is still possible to do so until August 27, date of the big party we are organizing to thank all donors. Every additional dollar raised will allow us to strengthen our organization so that we can sustain our work in the neighbourhood. Thus, you can still make all the difference on the things to come. Thanks again!


SEE BELOW FOR THE ENGLISH VERSION.
La Fonderie La Fonderie Darling est un Centre d'arts visuels situé au cœur du Vieux-Montréal, dans la Cité du Multimédia. Elle a pour mission de soutenir la création, la production et la diffusion d'œuvres d'arts visuels. Plusieurs artistes de renom y ont occupé un atelier ou exposé leurs œuvres à des moments critiques de leur carrière, notamment Brian Jungen, Valérie Blass, Anthony Burnham, Mathieu Beauséjour, Stan Douglas et Jana Sterbak.






Notre vision 
L’art ne doit pas demeurer confiné dans les murs, réservé à un groupe d’initiés. C’est pourquoi la Fonderie a, depuis ses débuts, investi l’espace public afin de démocratiser l’accès à l’art contemporain, pour tous. Parmi nos projets phares, on compte Panique au Faubourg (1997), SilophoNe (2001) et Plan large (2001-2010). 
 

Natural Selection, Carlos et Jason Sanchez, 2009. Cette photographie, fleuron d'un cycle d'images percutantes sur des panneaux publicitaires abandonnés, a marqué l'imaginaire de centaines de citoyens.

Notre projet

Depuis 8 ans, la Fonderie Darling aménage chaque été une place publique sur la rue Ottawa. Cette place devient un lieu de rassemblement des gens qui habitent et travaillent dans le quartier, un lieu de destination pour les touristes et les citoyens curieux de découvrir une expérience unique et inusitée. Des discussions sur l’art, des performances et des street partys y sont organisés
 tout l’été. À terme, nous souhaitons que cette place devienne 
permanente, soit animée à l’année et qu’y soient aménagées des œuvres 
créées sur mesure pour les lieux.









Été 2015Nous avons besoin de votre aide pour permettre l’installation cette année de Mirador, une œuvre spectaculaire du Collectif Acapulco qui prend la forme d'une montagne schématisée s'étendant sur une grande surface de l'immeuble faisant face à la Fonderie Darling. Une entrée aménagée à la base de la structure permettra de pénétrer à l'intérieur de ce fragment de paysage et d'en arpenter les entrailles afin de profiter du point de vue exceptionnel offert par le promontoire situé au sommet. Ceux qui font l’ascension de la montagne s'exposent ainsi à une perspective tout à fait différente sur le décor environnant. 



Mirador, avec son esthétique brute rappelant les chantiers de construction, est le résultat d'une réflexion autour du paysage, du factice, des jeux d'échelle et de l'espace public.


Nous faisons donc appel au public pour nous aider à amasser les 25 000$ nécessaires à la production et la mise en place de l’œuvre, de même qu’à l’animation de la place publique. Si nous dépassons notre objectif, les fonds excédentaires permettront à la Fonderie de consolider son organisation de façon à pouvoir pérenniser son action dans le quartier. 





Le passé garant de l'avenir


Courte-Pointe, de Philippe Allard et Justin Duschesneau, prix Art public 2014

Variations, de Jean-Paul Ganem et Abbas Akhevan (2014),

Pourquoi donner? 

Depuis quelque temps, les artistes et les organismes à but non lucratif (OBNL) subissent des coupures de financement sans précédent, et leurs activités en sont durement touchées. En tant qu'OBNL, la Fonderie Darling doit compter sur des subventions et des dons privés pour assurer sa survie. Grâce à votre aide, nous pourrons continuer d'animer notre place publique et y installer cette année une nouvelle œuvre d'art public dont tous pourront profiter.

ENGLISH VERSION:

The Foundry
The Darling Foundry is a visual arts centre located in the heart of Old Montreal in Cité du Multimédia. Its mission is to support the creation, production, and dissemination of visual artworks. Several renowned artists have rented a studio or exhibited their works at critical moments of their career, including Brian Jungen, Valérie Blass, Anthony Burnham, Mathieu Beauséjour, Stan Douglas, and Jana Sterbak.

Our Vision

Art must not remain confined within the walls and be reserved to a group of insiders. Which is why since its foundation, the Foundry has invested in the public space to democratize access to contemporary art for all. Its flagship projects include Panique au Faubourg (1997), Silophone (2001), and Plan Large (2001-2010). 


Natural Selection, by Carlos and Jason Sanchez, 2009.
Our Project
For 8 years, the Darling Foundry has launched its public space every summer on Ottawa Street. This place has become a gathering community for people who live and work in the neighborhood as well as a destination for tourists and citizens interested in discovering a unique and unusual experience. Artistic performances, discussions on art and street parties are held all summer long. Our ambition is to make this public place permanent and alive all year long, inhabited by tailor-made visual artworks.










Summer 2015

We need your help to install Mirador, a spectacular work from the art collective Acapulco, this year. This piece takes the form of a mountain extending over a large surface of the building facing the Darling Foundry. An entry on the base of the structure delves inside a segment of the landscape and allows visitors to survey the depths and take advantage of the exceptional point of view offered by the headland located at the top. Those who manage to ascend the mountain are thus exposed to quite a different perspective of the surrounding scenery.


Mirador, with its raw aesthetics, recalls construction sites and is the result of a reflection around the landscape, the artificial, the scale effect, as well as the public space.


We are thus appealing to you to help raise $25,000 needed for the production and installation of this artwork, as well as for the animation of the public place. Any additional amount raised will enable the Foundry to consolidate its organisation so as to sustain its action in the area.









The Past Guarantees the Future

<h3>Well, hello there! Where does the time go?</h3>
<p>It's been a year since I received my MFA in Studio Art from Florida State University. I have about a year of co-directing a nonprofit under my belt, and I've been teaching in the Department of Art at FSU on top of finding a renewed focus in my studio practice! In my journey to balance it all, I'm so excited to be part of <a href=""http://wassaicartistresidency.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Wassaic Artist Residency</a> this summer to really hunker down, and get back into the swing of things.</p>
<h3>Artist Statement:</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Currently, I have two bodies of work. Firstly, I'm exploring paintings with translucent surfaces allowing the infrastructure to become the image underneath. They are read as paintings when on the wall, but when installed perpendicular to walls, or in the round, they create associations with architecture, furniture, and the body. In the second body of work, paint returns to the surface in built up layers, opaque and translucent, referencing the figure and even food.  The frame and wall are exposed through the surface becoming part of the image while also disrupting it. My paintings and sculptures engage in a dialog about vulnerability and the competing desire to either remain private, or explicitly share. Details are found behind layers through variations of concealing and revealing information.</p>
<h3><strong>Why do I need your help?</strong></h3>
<p>As I mentioned last year, I'm not great about asking for help, but I'm getting better! Attending residencies is important for maintaining an active career in the arts. They allow you to set aside time to concentrate on studio work, but the also give you the opportunity to meet new creatives you might not otherwise meet. The folks I met last year in Vermont are invaluable friends in my field. We keep up to date, we talk about jobs and opportunities, and we keep an eye out for each other. What more could you ask for?</p>
<p>Well:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm looking to raise $2000 to assist in covering travel, residency fees, food, supplies, and other costs of living and breathing while away. There's a lot to think about when you need to get from A to B! And then A again.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>I want to give back to you, too! </strong></i> Once again, I'm offering sweet perks and works of art in exchange for your generosity.</li>
<li><strong><u><i>All perks come with a social media shoutout unless you'd like to donate anonymously! I'll see your name, but no one else will if you choose ""anonymous"".</i></u></strong></li>
<li>If I do not reach my goal, I will make ends meet, but I really can't do it without you!  Plus, all of these sweet perks and works of art have to go somewhere, you might as well have them, right?</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>How is this important?</h3>
<p>On a basic level:</p>
<ul>
<li>Residencies give artists time away to focus on their studio practice, which is typically fit squarely between a myriad of other important responsibilities we face. In a sense, <i>art</i> is job that takes incredible devotion, time, commitment, and money. It's never easy. </li>
<li>Residencies build community with peers and mentors. Professionals in the field attend as well as scheduled visiting artists/curators who come to critique your work in your residency studio. Even with social media, community in the field is hard to build; it's hard to connect! Coming to a new place to meet and work with new creatives is beyond measurable.</li>
</ul>
<h3>In a broader sense:</h3>
<p>Artists make their own way, they materialize their own opportunities, and they facilitate. Relative concept I'm sure!</p>
<p>Support artists! Help me out by collecting something from me.</p>
<h3>Asking for help is <i><strong>really</strong></i> hard.</h3>
<p> Who doesn't want to be able to do it all on their own?</p>
<ul>
<li>By giving me a hand, you support not just an artist, but a friend. That's right, friend. Get ready for <i><strong>friendship</strong></i>.</li>
<li>I happily give to other artists and projects when I can.  I've supported campaigns in the past, and it really makes a positive difference!  I bet you like it, too!  I fancy myself the betting type (but seriously, keep the slot machines at a distance. DANGER ZONE).</li>
<li>It's not hobby despite how I file my taxes (still a hobby).  I've dedicated my education and my career to art. I'm committed!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>How Else Can I Help?</h3>
<p>Money is tight for everyone!  </p>
<p>There are more ways to help than shaking your wallet upside down and hoping for the best.  I did this the other day, and nothing came out this time. NOTHING. Well, a rewards card for a place I don't shop fell out, BUT THAT'S BESIDE THE POINT.</p>
<ul>
<li>Share my campaign on social media!  It's the fastest and easiest way to get the word out.  Get loud.</li>
<li>Indiegogo makes it easy to share!  Share your heart out!  (But be careful:  replacement hearts are hard to come by.)</li>

<h3>What's Needed</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524592042/gdlyar1ljfwvki55khy5.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>In order to advance my work, I will need my own workshop.

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524592004/y6fgufkxuiyzln81rgvi.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>and the glory hole ($6,550) for reheating the glass in-between working on the gaffer's bench.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Both of the pieces of equipment I'm looking to purchase are custom made by a small business owner who's been blowing glass and building these pieces for years (both of the above pics are from his website). Its clear from the design of these pieces that they were crafted by someone with experience in the field as all the elements are right where I need them! You can learn more about his work <a href=""https://www.theglasshive.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. Shipping for these pieces to New Hampshire will be about $1,000.</p>
<p>Sum total = $13,250. Thanks to contributions received from my pre-campaign of $950, I now only need to raise $12,300 - which is the target for this campaign. </p>
<p>I already have a structure to house the workshop (thanks to the family for letting me renovate the garage!), as well as a small kiln for annealing due to my fused glass work. I'm planning on a small business loan to cover the costs of the range of smaller items that will round out the workshop (about $5,000), including a gaffer's bench, steel tables, a grinder for polishing pieces, glass for smelting, and the various tools of the trade (jacks, blocks of different shapes, molds, scissors, punty rods, blow pipes, etc.). Once things have started up and I've begun production, I'll be saving up for a larger annealer (about $2,000).</p>
<p>The total cost of the endeavor will be about $20,000, over half of which I hope to raise here via flexible funding. If I don't hit the fundraising goal, I plan on pulling together the remainder of the needed funds via a small business loan - if necessary.</p>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>All that said, the banks really have enough money already and I'm hoping we can work together to keep more money in our pockets! I've set up perk rewards to offer you both flexibility and opportunity. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1524654237/ozoakfdu0ylbsri84yl6.png"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/></p>
<p>Flexibility: You can select from custom made art works of varying complexity as well as reward points on my website which will let you pick from anything I have in stock (eg. jewelry, home decor, blown pieces, holiday art, etc.).  Apologies for my glass stock being so low! Most of the larger blown pieces were sold in Nov./Dec. - hence the need for a workshop...</p>
<p>Opportunity: With higher support levels, you will get improved discounts and savings. The last two perk levels are meant as an enticement for both individuals who have come to support my work and plan on buying more in the years to come, as well as businesses looking to improve their offerings to clientele (e.g. outfitting a bed and breakfast with unique and local handmade art, restaurants in the market for hand-blown glass ware, or gift shops looking for an opportunity to re-sell some of my glass work.)</p>
<p>Please note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pictures of glass pieces are samples of my past work, if you order an egg, heart, leaf, bowl, vase, or tumblers you will get a unique item crafted just for you!</li>
<li>Rewards points translate to 100 points per $1.00. </li>
<li>For those selecting Rewards Points as their perks - my inventory will be increasing very quickly after I get the workshop up and running; please be patient as I get caught up!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Crafting Change</h3>
<p>The furnace and glory hole are the two pieces of equipment critical to my plan for furthering the glass craft. Once these are in place, there's really only a few items that I need in order to get the ball rolling again and expand my crafting. </p>
<p>I am fortunate in that I have built a solid reputation, and generally try to do my best to improve the world around me through my work and participation in my parish community (if you'd like to know more about the other things I do, visit me on <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/petermwantal"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LinkedIn</a> or just run a google search for ""Peter Antal New Hampshire"").</p>
<p>Being successful in this effort means that, not only will I continue to be able to make items that will bring you a smile, but, for our family, it means a new opportunity to be self-reliant on what our own hands can produce and a little more stability in a world that's constantly fraught with upheaval and uncertainty. </p>
<p>On behalf of myself and my family, many thanks for taking the time to review my campaign request. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask! </p>

My name is Peter Antal and I've been working with glass for about five years now in beautiful New Hampshire and Vermont. To date, I've created hundreds of pieces, both in blown and fused mediums. I've shared my love of the work  with family, friends, and folks all over the world (it's pretty awesome to think that one of my blown ornaments graces a Christmas tree in England, while a hand blown tumbler rests on a patio table somewhere in the Mariana Islands). I hold regular giveaway events for folks following me on Facebook, Instagram and on Email and also donate proceeds of selected glass items to some of the nonprofit organizations I have a direct connection to.
100% of the proceeds of all Angel pendants sold in  2015-2017 were donated to Neighbors to Nicaragua. 
 
 
 
I love the almost limitless capacity for originality and fluidity that blown and shaped glass presents. It allows for the connection of mind, body, and spirit into one complete form. With these elements, I reshape the glass to get truly unique patterns and mixes of color, making items that are both useful and inspiring. Every once in a while, something comes out of a finished glass piece that I could never have made happen on my own in a hundred tries, yet I am truly thankful when it does. This is the primary reason I stay with this medium and am always looking forward to the next finished piece.

But I need your help! 

What's Needed
In order to advance my work, I will need my own workshop. The two biggest and most expensive pieces of equipment will be the furnace ($5,700) for keeping the glass in a molten stage ready for gathering and shaping...
 
 
 
and the glory hole ($6,550) for reheating the glass in-between working on the gaffer's bench.

<h3><strong>What is IMAGES all about?</strong></h3>
<p>The <a href=""http://www.imagesfestival.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Images Festival</strong></a><strong> </strong>is Toronto’s original <strong>inter-disciplinary arts festival</strong>. “Expanding cinema” since 1988, the Images Festival celebrates the moving image in all its forms – going beyond theatrical screenings to embrace <strong>live performances</strong>, <strong>gallery installations</strong> and <strong>site-specific interventions</strong>. Showcasing the best in contemporary image arts from around the world every April, Images provokes audiences to imagine what is possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Sounds cool – when and where is this happening again?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Duane and Tanya</strong> will be <strong>in residence</strong> from Monday <strong>April 15</strong> to Friday <strong>April 19</strong> in the Main Space of <a href=""http://www.mocca.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>MOCCA</strong></a>, 952 Queen Street West at Shaw. The public is invited to join the artists for <strong>open rehearsals</strong> that week, which will culminate in a <strong>final LIVE performance</strong> on Saturday <strong>April 20</strong> from 4 to 6 PM. The show features a Pay What You Can admission, so it's open to all!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>But what if you don’t meet your target? Will the show still go on?</strong></h3>
<p>Yes it will. Images is very lucky to count on the support of our <strong>public funders</strong> as well as our <strong>private sponsors</strong>, <strong>members</strong> and <strong>donors</strong> to make our festival happen every year. But we wish to be proactive about diversifying our revenue, and relying less on public funding in future. <strong>We wish to make incredible projects like this one self-sustaining</strong>, so that we don’t have to dip into our operating funds, which may result in a deficit and thus reduced programming in future.</p>
<p>Your donations will contribute to <strong>artist fees</strong>, travel, accommodations, equipment, materials, space rental, and every other component required to make an <strong>ambitious and innovative </strong>project like <em>grain(s)</em> a reality. But most importantly, your support – at any level - helps Images establish a “<strong>Culture of Giving</strong>” that will benefit Canadian media artists for generations to come.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Help us get the message out!</strong></h3>
<p>Even if you’re not in the position to contribute, <strong>please help spread the word</strong> and <strong>share this campaign</strong> on your Facebook, Twitter, newsletter and other personal networks!</p>

What is IMAGES all about?
The Images Festival is Toronto’s original inter-disciplinary arts festival. “Expanding cinema” since 1988, the Images Festival celebrates the moving image in all its forms – going beyond theatrical screenings to embrace live performances, gallery installations and site-specific interventions. Showcasing the best in contemporary image arts from around the world every April, Images provokes audiences to imagine what is possible.
 
Sounds cool – when and where is this happening again?
Duane and Tanya will be in residence from Monday April 15 to Friday April 19 in the Main Space of MOCCA, 952 Queen Street West at Shaw. The public is invited to join the artists for open rehearsals that week, which will culminate in a final LIVE performance on Saturday April 20 from 4 to 6 PM. The show features a Pay What You Can admission, so it's open to all!
 
But what if you don’t meet your target? Will the show still go on?
Yes it will. Images is very lucky to count on the support of our public funders as well as our private sponsors, members and donors to make our festival happen every year. But we wish to be proactive about diversifying our revenue, and relying less on public funding in future. We wish to make incredible projects like this one self-sustaining, so that we don’t have to dip into our operating funds, which may result in a deficit and thus reduced programming in future.
Your donations will contribute to artist fees, travel, accommodations, equipment, materials, space rental, and every other component required to make an ambitious and innovative project like grain(s) a reality. But most importantly, your support – at any level - helps Images establish a “Culture of Giving” that will benefit Canadian media artists for generations to come.
 
Help us get the message out!
Even if you’re not in the position to contribute, please help spread the word and share this campaign on your Facebook, Twitter, newsletter and other personal networks!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3> </h3>
<p>My name is Rose Luciano. I am a Lancaster native proudly born in the Southeast sector of the city and raised in Ephrata, Pennsylvania. As a member of the Latino Community, I spent a lifetime witnessing the need for <i>collaboration and empowerment</i>. We all have a purpose, but often times opportunities are denied to some of our brightest minds and creators. Inspired by the potential in my community, I made it my life mission to devote myself to the needs of the underrepresented<strong>. </strong>I spend my time motivating every artist, entrepreneur, and community member to realize their full potential, even within the most marginalized parts of society. Through this, my mission has planted seeds to actualize the change needed in society. When we deal with the difficult conversations on issues such as diversity and inclusion, we have the opportunity to  learn and become better citizens. We learn how  to help and support one another to be the brightest version of themselves. <strong><i>This is Fruition Collective</i></strong>. Fruition Collective provides a platform to<i> listen, learn, and amplify the voices of this community</i> by being vulnerable and authentic.<strong> It is a brave space to enjoy art, activism, comedy, culture, and above all, community.</strong></p>
<p>The Fruition Collective is comprised of an artistic team of various backgrounds and strengths. Each member has been raised in Central Pennsylvania, and understands the unique needs of this community. Together, our team raises the standards for inclusive collaborations within our city. We create programs that challenge normative social beliefs and attitudes; inspiring and empowering them to bridge divides in the city and build community.</p>
<p>My dream for<strong> Fruition Collective is to become the creative, institutional hub in downtown Lancaster: a place synonymous with our city's urban landscape.</strong> Drawing and attracting diverse talent in Lancaster City also attracts the most diverse audiences, enriching our city culture.  Fruition Collective and its sponsors aspire to build vitality and culture within the city limits. Its presence alone changes the way young Lancastrian's view the world, giving them a profound perspective on what constitutes a just community.<br/>We want to be the template that others will look to for social change through artistry!</p>
<h3>Mission statement</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504333318/zim79vqnsqaebrg7uarh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Fruition Collective’s mission is to provide a safe and inclusive space for Lancaster City residents of all colors, backgrounds, orientations, and status to learn, disseminate, educate, and share their art. We are dedicated to amplifying voices and creating authentic community in Lancaster City and its surrounding neighborhoods.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>We are a creative group of individuals being challenged to build inclusive community through our art and altruistic spirits!</i></strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Fruition Collective's needs are endless, but the reward for the growth will amplify and uplift all! By providing a healthy foundation, our community will come to Fruition!</p>
<ul>
<li>The building is in need of a major renovation to provide a safe space for us to create and host more artists and community members. We are blessed to have architectural plans in place to proceed with new additions and repair, but the financial burden associated with this undertaking is great.​ Contributions to our campaign will assist us in sustaining our operations during construction. </li>
<li>We are in need of event supplies: tables, chairs, linens, and decor. Your monetary contributions would allow us to purchase these necessary items to provide our patrons with a beautiful, comfortable, and unique venue they deserve for their events.</li>
</ul>
<p>We need your help to continue our growth by watering  the foundation of our business.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are a for-profit business with a social mission. We strive to use our creative passions and talents to present exciting interdisciplinary art programming that will reach diverse audiences. <i>Our events not only entertain, but educate audiences on the importance of awareness, empathy, and compassion towards our neighbors.</i><br/><br/>Fruition Collective impacts our community in myriad ways.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We provide a safe haven for our community to meet and engage in conversation with one another, promoting inclusiveness and harmony in our city.</p></li>

<li>Located in the heart of downtown Lancaster at 24 W. Walnut Street, Fruition Collective is an event space available to rent by individuals, businesses, and non-profit organizations. We offer space for co-working, private events, classes and workshops, performances, and visual art exhibits. Our range of programs is wide and includes, but is not limited to: fitness, book signings, dance parties, and social justice workshops.</li>
<li>We contribute directly and significantly to the vitality and livelihood of our city by bridging the gap between cultures within our community.</li>
</ul>
<p>​Our goal is to ensure people feel supported to work and play in a unique and inspiring space.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Our biggest risk comes from our business model. We are a for-profit business with a social mission.That adds complexity to our capacity to generate income. While we may apply for grants, we are limited in types and amounts in which we are eligible. Since grants are a major source of funding for many art organizations, it is not a realistic channel for us. Therefore, we rely heavily on private events and Fruition Collective events to generate a majority of our income. As a new start-up company, we continue to be challenged in meeting overhead costs with the income produced from ticket sales. It is imperative that we can secure money to purchase necessary items to host amazing events, to continue to meet the needs of our clients, and deliver memorable events.</li>
<li>There is a huge social challenge that we must address as well. We risk offending our community in our attempt to be inclusive. It may be viewed as ""forcing"" interactions instead of what it is to us: sharing, openness, and vulnerability. Many people have found a ""comfort-zone"" in their beliefs and attitudes and they do not wish to be challenged to think differently.   </li>

<p><strong><i>The crowdfunding is still open!<br/>The project itself was put on hold in connection with the Covid-19.<br/>New dates will be communicated as they become available.<br/>Please understand that the project is still going to be realised,<br/>so we need your support (even more)!</i><br/><br/>The initiative:</strong><br/>La Biennale de Momon project was set up by Frans van Lent,  a Dutch artist, based in Dordrecht, the Netherlands. His recent projects include the <a href=""http://unnoticedartfestival.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Unnoticed Art Festival,</a> the <a href=""http://theconceptbank.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ConceptBank</a> and the <a href=""http://theparallelshow.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ParallelShow</a>. There is no clear distinction between his practice as a performance artist and his curatorial projects. He often invites other artists to participate on an equal basis. La Biennale de Momon is about the solidity and continuity of the physical world as opposed to the human temporary presence.<br/><br/><strong>The project:</strong><br/>Maumont is a small village in the Perigord in France. It consists of 15 houses, around 30 inhabitants and there is no church, shop, café or other public facility. Only a few original residents are still living in the village; many died over the years, others left to live elsewhere. Today most inhabitants are newcomers and pensioners, often from other countries. <br/>Twenty years ago you could still smell the farms everywhere. Herds of cows and sheep were led through the village every day. The village has changed, from a place where all was related to soil, growth and the seasons, to a place where the inhabitants mainly stroll, relax and dream.</p>
<p><i>Momon</i> is the old name of the village, no longer in use since the name <i>Maumont</i> was introduced. <i>Momon</i> stands for the village as it exists in the mind. It is no longer physically linked to the location, it is linked to memories and coloured by nostalgia. <br/>La Biennale de Momon starts from the village, but it will only be that starting point. Nothing will be changed but, on the contrary, it will remain the way it is. </p>
<p><strong>The artists:</strong><br/>Eight artists are working in this project: <strong><a href=""http://sarahboulton.co.uk/jennyshouse.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sarah Boulton</a> </strong>(GB),<strong> <a href=""http://marcbuchy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Marc Buchy</a> </strong>(FR/BE),<strong> <a href=""http://joid.org/archive/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Joan Heemskerk</a> </strong>(NL),<strong> <a href=""http://susanamendessilva.com/sms.aspx?LNG=EN"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Susana Mendes Silva</a> </strong>(PT),<strong> <a href=""https://joshuaschwebel.com/home.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Josh Schwebel</a> </strong>(DE/CA),<strong> <a href=""http://lisaskuret.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lisa Skuret</a> </strong>(US/GB),<strong> <a href=""http://www.eliatorrecilla.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Elia Torrecilla</a> </strong>(ES)<strong> </strong>and<strong> <a href=""https://fransvanlent.nl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Frans van Lent</a> </strong>(NL)<strong>.</strong> They all have a certain preference for creating work without a material body, without physical traces.

</div></div>","The crowdfunding is still open!The project itself was put on hold in connection with the Covid-19.New dates will be communicated as they become available.Please understand that the project is still going to be realised,so we need your support (even more)!The initiative:La Biennale de Momon project was set up by Frans van Lent,  a Dutch artist, based in Dordrecht, the Netherlands. His recent projects include the Unnoticed Art Festival, the ConceptBank and the ParallelShow. There is no clear distinction between his practice as a performance artist and his curatorial projects. He often invites other artists to participate on an equal basis. La Biennale de Momon is about the solidity and continuity of the physical world as opposed to the human temporary presence.The project:Maumont is a small village in the Perigord in France. It consists of 15 houses, around 30 inhabitants and there is no church, shop, café or other public facility. Only a few original residents are still living in the village; many died over the years, others left to live elsewhere. Today most inhabitants are newcomers and pensioners, often from other countries. Twenty years ago you could still smell the farms everywhere. Herds of cows and sheep were led through the village every day. The village has changed, from a place where all was related to soil, growth and the seasons, to a place where the inhabitants mainly stroll, relax and dream.
Momon is the old name of the village, no longer in use since the name Maumont was introduced. Momon stands for the village as it exists in the mind. It is no longer physically linked to the location, it is linked to memories and coloured by nostalgia. La Biennale de Momon starts from the village, but it will only be that starting point. Nothing will be changed but, on the contrary, it will remain the way it is. 
The artists:Eight artists are working in this project: Sarah Boulton (GB), Marc Buchy (FR/BE), Joan Heemskerk (NL), Susana Mendes Silva (PT), Josh Schwebel (DE/CA), Lisa Skuret (US/GB), Elia Torrecilla (ES) and Frans van Lent (NL). They all have a certain preference for creating work without a material body, without physical traces. Their ultimate works might consist of texts, scores, images or sounds, everything that can live online without actually touching the physical ground.During one week in the first half of this year, every artist will individually stay in a small house in the village. She/he will use this time to get familiair with the village, with its surroundings, its inhabitants. And they will of course prepare and create.
LaBiennaleDeMomon.org:Finally La Biennale de Momon can only be experienced online. The will be no physical traces left in the village to find. The project will officially be presented at LaBiennaleDeMomon.org  on July 15, 2020.You can of course always choose to visit the location, but do not expect to see something different than what it always was: just a small village in the Perigord.And finally:​In November 2020 we will organise a public conference in the Dordrechts Museum in Dordrecht, the Netherlands.

<p><a href=""http://www.theboxshow.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u><strong>The Box Show</strong></u></a> is an award-winning solo show (written and performed by Dominique Salerno) where one actor performs over 25 characters from inside a small box.

</div></div>","Hi! My name is Sylvia Nan Cheng and I am the creator of please come in please, an interactive installation selected to be part of this year's Scotiabank Nuit Blanche. 



On October 4th from 6:53 pm to sunrise, over 100 never-before-seen art projects will transform the city of Toronto. Each year, this event lures over 1,000,000 people from the comfort of their couches to venture outside and experience contemporary art. ---------------------
What is it?
This is 160 square feet of pure bliss! Okay, that was probably a bit of an exaggeration. I designed this house with the intention of running it as a non-for-profit shelter. People who are unfamiliar with the tiny house movement need to be able to live in it comfortably for up to a week. 
It has most modern conveniences such as electricity and running water, just in smaller doses:


a small kitchen with a single convention burner and a compact refrigerator 
small sleeping loft with a beautiful skylight 
tatami area for entertaining guests 
a small bathroom with a shower stall, bathroom vanity and composting toilet
---------------------

How's it going?
This self-funded project has been a year in the making. While the square footage might be tiny (160 square feet), the cost of building it has been a hefty one. I need your help with the final leg of the project!
I have some great footage of the build process that I will be sharing over the course of the campaign.---------------------
Where Can I See It?
On October 4th, this tiny house will travel to its official exhibition location at Victoria Memorial Park, 10 Niagara Street. For additional details, go to the official Nuit Blanche project page: http://www.scotiabanknuitblanche.ca/project.html?project_id=1482

---------------------
How You Can Help!
I estimate it will cost $3500 for:

A licensed truck driver to haul this 10,000 pound house to the exhibition location and back. 
Security guards on Nuit Blanche to keep the Saturday night drunkards at bay. 
A photographer/videographer to document the magical night. 
Anything beyond the original goal will go towards purchasing windows and doors for the house. 



---------------------
What You Will Receive!





What should I do? You get to suggest an activity for me to do/perform as part of please come in please. All suggestions will be listed on the ""Suggestion"" page anonymously. Must be claimed by midnight on October 3rd.





I will whisper your name into the evening sky as part of the 12-hour duration performance on Scotiabank Nuit Blanche. Your name will also appear on the ""Supported By"" page. Must be claimed before sunrise on October 5th.


I will write/draw you a personalized postcard as part of the 12-hour duration performance on Scotiabank Nuit Blanche. Your name will also appear on the ""Supported By"" page. 





I will make you a ceramic pin as part of the 12-hour duration performance on Scotiabank Nuit Blanche. Your name will also appear on the ""Supported By"" page. 



Remember the night. I will personally deliver or send you a limited edition print of the house. Your name will also appear on the ""Supported By"" page. (Available in Canada and continental USA only.)


Have a piece of history. I will personally deliver or send you a pair of paperweights made from discarded materials from the construction process of this project. Each one will be unique. Your name will also appear on the ""Supported By"" page. (Available in Canada and continental USA only.)

I will be staging my performance/ installation piece ""I Have Lost You"" in preparation for my first solo show at Five Myles Gallery in July 2014 in Brooklyn, New York. </p><p>During my residency I will be working on :</p><p>*creating workshops for children, introducing them to Shadow Puppetry and staging performances on the street. </p><p>*As well as collaborating closely with local theater/ dance troupes as part of ""I Have Lost You"" project</p><p> * Directing my first feature film working title ""Funeral""</p><p><b></b></p><p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Arial;""><b><b>""I HAVE LOST YOU""</b> </b></p><b>
</b><b></b><p style=""""><b>Significance/Meaning</b>: I am hoping this residency will allow me to stage this piece and create meaningful connections with actors/dancers performing as well as create a bridge between the community/viewer and the artist. I am interested in the exploration of puppetry ; the meaning and traditions involved within this art form. &amp; with that exploration of traditional fado and funeral customs. Investigation of space &amp; sound within projection of shadow puppetry, combined with installation &amp; performance art. I believe that with the chant of the words the atmosphere created reaches an element and similar emotional effect of fado. With the repetition of the words ""I have lost you I have lost you Can't reach you anymore"" an emotional significance takes place and the visitors/participants start reflecting on the love(s) they have experienced and lost.The lament and torment reaches a climax which allows the participants to finally reach peace within themselves and move on/ recreate a funeral procession for their feelings.</p><p></p><p><b></b></p><p style=""""><b><b>Visual/Production Design</b>: </b>With the projection of shadow puppetry on the walls I am trying to present ghosts &amp; similar spiritual representation of past lovers. Additional projection of a river flowing throughout the space reveals it self slowly. River representing life &amp; the natural flow of energy and passage of time. The performer &amp; additional actors main action is to conjure the ghost of a former love and lament the loss of this person and by doing so act out the customs of a funeral. The actors/ singers repeat the main performers actions creating an echo ;he/she is playing a drum proceeded by the church bells. The performers are spread out through the space dressed in mourning attire and surrounded by wine, bread &amp; meat. Their actions are dictated by the sound, some of them continuing to sing/ whisper and some fainting while others are sharing the food and wine with the viewers.They are mourning/ celebrating the loss of a lover. The viewers are encouraged to write down the name of a"" lost love"" &amp; toss it in the ""river"" projection.</p><p></p><p style=""margin: 0.0px 0.0px 15.0px 0.0px; font: 14.0px Arial; color: #232323;"">There is limited set design through out the room; atmosphere is mostly created by lights/candles and a fog machine.

The residency took place in Brno, Czech Republic. Over the course of a month we created a site specific installation in Dasein Prostor Gallery.

This was a very important project which introduced and challenged me as an artist to create and work in another country and still to this day inspires me to push myself as a working artist.</p><b style=""font-weight: bold; font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif !important; font-size: 15px !important; line-height: 1.45em !important;"">Art Statement </b><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""line-height: 1.45em !important;"">I am a keen observer of overlooked moments. My artwork explores my interest in fleeting moments and reflections on everyday life. In my illustration, photography, video/installation projects I tell a story sometimes autobiographical and sometimes fictional with elements of fantasy. This allows me to create contradictions and distort everyday reality as well as explore interventions into normal life. I capture experiences significant and insignificant during my trips abroad and life in Brooklyn. Impressions of daily life and people are elements that continue to appear in my work. Each day becomes a full force of visual stimulation that leaves lasting memories which inspire me to create a new piece or capture it on film. By staging images and using alternative processes I am transforming the random grists of my life into meaningful stories.</span><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/383647/files/20140220163918-SDC14234.jpg?1392943158"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 30px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Your contributions</span><br/></p><p>The Largo das Artes Residency in Brazil, is 100% self-funded.<span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 19px;""></span></p><p>As all expenses related to the residency are paid by the artists, you will be helping me pay for:</p><ul style=""margin-top: 1em; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 0px; padding-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 40px;"">

<p></p></div>","My name is Magda Rachwal; I am a set designer, puppetry maker, scenic painter & artist and I have been selected to take part in the Largo das Artes Residency programme in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil for the month of April. I will be staging my performance/ installation piece ""I Have Lost You"" in preparation for my first solo show at Five Myles Gallery in July 2014 in Brooklyn, New York. During my residency I will be working on :*creating workshops for children, introducing them to Shadow Puppetry and staging performances on the street. *As well as collaborating closely with local theater/ dance troupes as part of ""I Have Lost You"" project * Directing my first feature film working title ""Funeral""""I HAVE LOST YOU"" 
Significance/Meaning: I am hoping this residency will allow me to stage this piece and create meaningful connections with actors/dancers performing as well as create a bridge between the community/viewer and the artist. I am interested in the exploration of puppetry ; the meaning and traditions involved within this art form. & with that exploration of traditional fado and funeral customs. Investigation of space & sound within projection of shadow puppetry, combined with installation & performance art. I believe that with the chant of the words the atmosphere created reaches an element and similar emotional effect of fado. With the repetition of the words ""I have lost you I have lost you Can't reach you anymore"" an emotional significance takes place and the visitors/participants start reflecting on the love(s) they have experienced and lost.The lament and torment reaches a climax which allows the participants to finally reach peace within themselves and move on/ recreate a funeral procession for their feelings.Visual/Production Design: With the projection of shadow puppetry on the walls I am trying to present ghosts & similar spiritual representation of past lovers. Additional projection of a river flowing throughout the space reveals it self slowly. River representing life & the natural flow of energy and passage of time. The performer & additional actors main action is to conjure the ghost of a former love and lament the loss of this person and by doing so act out the customs of a funeral. The actors/ singers repeat the main performers actions creating an echo ;he/she is playing a drum proceeded by the church bells. The performers are spread out through the space dressed in mourning attire and surrounded by wine, bread & meat. Their actions are dictated by the sound, some of them continuing to sing/ whisper and some fainting while others are sharing the food and wine with the viewers.They are mourning/ celebrating the loss of a lover. The viewers are encouraged to write down the name of a"" lost love"" & toss it in the ""river"" projection.There is limited set design through out the room; atmosphere is mostly created by lights/candles and a fog machine. Accompanied by instruments, singing and whispers the sound builds up to a scream and with the repetition of ""I have lost you I have lost you; can't reach you anymore""(in english & portuguese: the torment and true feeling is revealed.
The proposed piece should be exhibited for 6-8 hours a day without stops..*How will this residency benefit me?With your help, attending this residency will allow me to reach the personal goal that I set for myself; challenging myself as an artist, working with actors & dancers, continuing my passion for introducing children to shadow puppetry as well as trying my hand at directing a feature film and learning portuguese.In 2012 I have collaborated on a project with fellow artist/friend Amela Parcic. The residency took place in Brno, Czech Republic. Over the course of a month we created a site specific installation in Dasein Prostor Gallery. The project included video projection, small collage works and found object sculpture and installation. This was a very important project which introduced and challenged me as an artist to create and work in another country and still to this day inspires me to push myself as a working artist.Art Statement I am a keen observer of overlooked moments. My artwork explores my interest in fleeting moments and reflections on everyday life. In my illustration, photography, video/installation projects I tell a story sometimes autobiographical and sometimes fictional with elements of fantasy. This allows me to create contradictions and distort everyday reality as well as explore interventions into normal life. I capture experiences significant and insignificant during my trips abroad and life in Brooklyn. Impressions of daily life and people are elements that continue to appear in my work. Each day becomes a full force of visual stimulation that leaves lasting memories which inspire me to create a new piece or capture it on film. By staging images and using alternative processes I am transforming the random grists of my life into meaningful stories.Your contributionsThe Largo das Artes Residency in Brazil, is 100% self-funded.As all expenses related to the residency are paid by the artists, you will be helping me pay for:

Residency fee

<a id=""Significance"" name=""Significance"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Social, Cultural and Economic Significance</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The Variety Arts Theater began its roots as the home for the historic Friday Morning Club, a women's social and political group founded by Caroline M. Severance. Since then, the Variety Arts Theater played host to many live performances from musicians, live theatrical plays and as the shooting location for a handful of movies. Our goal is to keep on with that tradition.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In addition, there are many social, cultural and economic improvements that will take place pending the success of this project such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing a facility for school productions</li>
<li>Acting as a community center of sorts for the future entertainers of tomorrow.</li>
<li>Creating jobs for the community within the theater</li>
</ul><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Historical Significance of the Variety Arts Center</p>
<ul>
<li>As the home to the Friday Morning Club, the building played a big role in civil and womens' rights movement for prominent leader Caroline Severance.</li>
<li>Declared a historical landmark in August 9, 1978 led by the efforts of Milt Larsen</li>
<li>Graced by the likes of Cecil B. DeMille, Charlie Chaplin, Pauline Fredrick, Samuel Goldwyn, Clark Gable, Eleanor Roosevelt, Lionel Barrymore, Cary Grant</li>
</ul><p><a href=""#UpTop"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3>
<a id=""Revenue"" name=""Revenue"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>Revenue Drivers and Social-Economic Enhancements</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">With the re-vitalization of the Los Angeles Variety Arts Theater will have certain and immediate community impact. </p>
<ul>
<li>Live 1,000 seat theater for the production of new plays, musicals and small concerts in its main theater.</li>
<li>Development of the restaurant and small theater space. </li>
<li>The arts programming and usage as planned for this property will create performing arts ticket revenues (theater tickets range from $54 to $356 per ticket) and dollars of community wide revenues through salaries, parking, restaurant and retail sales. </li>
<li>At 80-percent capacity the project will generate over $15 million of economic presence per year of operation. Economic impact of a significant historic building in downtown Los Angeles re-establishing its interior and exterior architectural values and returning it to active and cultural usage is both a cultural and educational benefit for the community as a whole.</li>
<li>The Historic Preservation for presentation of the arts to a wide diversity of the public and for visitors to the City. </li>
</ul><p><a href=""#UpTop"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Back to Top</a></p>
<h4>Educational Benefits</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The operation of a live theater will create educational experiences for audiences, internship opportunities for students and young professionals from the area's universities and community colleges, and provide opportunity for new employment in the creative crafts. The educational resources to the newly developing downtown district that includes LA Live and the Convention Center. </p>
<h4>Revitalizing Los Angeles</h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The project will fulfill the new performing venue viable for both commercial and artistic presentations that would attract a citywide and out of town visitor audience both daytime and after dark would provide an historic and cultural/entertainment destination for a broad mix of plays and musicals, and other performing arts presentations, beyond the Music Center hub in an expanding downtown district. In addition with the downtown area building commercial and residential warehouse spaces, lofts and apartments the theater will provide an outlet for the residents of a nearby intimate locale to attend.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Downtown Los Angeles has positioned itself to be the live entertainment mega-center of Southern California, and the Variety Arts Theater can provide the critically needed mid-size concert venue missing in LA Live area.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">The majority of live music venues in Los Angeles are northwest of Downtown, starting with The Wiltern and moving to Hollywood, including the Pantages, the Greek, the Avalon, the Kodak, the Henry Ford, The Hollywood Bowl, and the Gibson Amphitheater. Downtown Los Angeles can now boast of larger venues, including the Staples Center, the Nokia Theater, and the Orpheum, but missing from the party is the 1,000-seat music venue, a critical component in today's independent label driven music market. An attractive conveniently accessible midsize setting is desperately needed for acts seeking to take advantage of the Staples Center/Nokia Theater buzz and ""fill the seats"" before making the next step, as well as major acts wanting a more intimate stop during their West Coast tour. Not a single venue outside of Downtown can claim such a strategic location as the Variety Arts Theater.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">Folks, when the Variety Arts Theater renovation is completed and reopens after 2 years of successful performance programming we will donate every year to the boys and girls club of america, elementary schools, high schools and college performing arts programs which is our way of giving back to the community. Our school scholarship fund will provide an opportunity to reach children and adolescents when they are very impressionable and can be guided to work in the creative arts arena or behind the scenes of theater, cinema and television.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><strong></strong> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/427501/files/20140311195433-boys-and-girls-club-logo1.jpg?1394592873"" src="""" style=""width: 182.4px; height: 120px;""/></p><p><a href=""#UpTop"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Back to Top</a></p>

The Variety Arts Theater, A Rich Cultural Heritage
The Variety Arts Theater opened in 1924, the 1,100-seat proscenium arch theater was considered the most beautiful and acoustically perfect theater in Los Angeles. Top stars of the legitimate theater graced its boards for many years. The theater now sits dormant from time to time, until it is used for movie location filming for the entertainment industry.  

  (Photos circa 1924 - 1936)We plan to purchase and renovate the Variety Arts Theater back to its glory and more. Making the theater again the performance mecca it once was. To secure the theater is $12 million and $8 million to renovate the entire structure inside and out. Raising the campaigns' full amount of $20 million will prove the community and live theater lovers support the project.

Social, Cultural and Economic Significance
The Variety Arts Theater began its roots as the home for the historic Friday Morning Club, a women's social and political group founded by Caroline M. Severance. Since then, the Variety Arts Theater played host to many live performances from musicians, live theatrical plays and as the shooting location for a handful of movies. Our goal is to keep on with that tradition.
In addition, there are many social, cultural and economic improvements that will take place pending the success of this project such as:

Providing a facility for school productions
Acting as a community center of sorts for the future entertainers of tomorrow.
Creating jobs for the community within the theater
Historical Significance of the Variety Arts Center

As the home to the Friday Morning Club, the building played a big role in civil and womens' rights movement for prominent leader Caroline Severance.
Declared a historical landmark in August 9, 1978 led by the efforts of Milt Larsen
Graced by the likes of Cecil B. DeMille, Charlie Chaplin, Pauline Fredrick, Samuel Goldwyn, Clark Gable, Eleanor Roosevelt, Lionel Barrymore, Cary Grant

Revenue Drivers and Social-Economic Enhancements
With the re-vitalization of the Los Angeles Variety Arts Theater will have certain and immediate community impact. 

Live 1,000 seat theater for the production of new plays, musicals and small concerts in its main theater.
Development of the restaurant and small theater space. 
The arts programming and usage as planned for this property will create performing arts ticket revenues (theater tickets range from $54 to $356 per ticket) and dollars of community wide revenues through salaries, parking, restaurant and retail sales. 
At 80-percent capacity the project will generate over $15 million of economic presence per year of operation. Economic impact of a significant historic building in downtown Los Angeles re-establishing its interior and exterior architectural values and returning it to active and cultural usage is both a cultural and educational benefit for the community as a whole.
The Historic Preservation for presentation of the arts to a wide diversity of the public and for visitors to the City. 
Back to Top
Educational Benefits
The operation of a live theater will create educational experiences for audiences, internship opportunities for students and young professionals from the area's universities and community colleges, and provide opportunity for new employment in the creative crafts. The educational resources to the newly developing downtown district that includes LA Live and the Convention Center. 
Revitalizing Los Angeles
The project will fulfill the new performing venue viable for both commercial and artistic presentations that would attract a citywide and out of town visitor audience both daytime and after dark would provide an historic and cultural/entertainment destination for a broad mix of plays and musicals, and other performing arts presentations, beyond the Music Center hub in an expanding downtown district. In addition with the downtown area building commercial and residential warehouse spaces, lofts and apartments the theater will provide an outlet for the residents of a nearby intimate locale to attend.
Downtown Los Angeles has positioned itself to be the live entertainment mega-center of Southern California, and the Variety Arts Theater can provide the critically needed mid-size concert venue missing in LA Live area.The majority of live music venues in Los Angeles are northwest of Downtown, starting with The Wiltern and moving to Hollywood, including the Pantages, the Greek, the Avalon, the Kodak, the Henry Ford, The Hollywood Bowl, and the Gibson Amphitheater. Downtown Los Angeles can now boast of larger venues, including the Staples Center, the Nokia Theater, and the Orpheum, but missing from the party is the 1,000-seat music venue, a critical component in today's independent label driven music market. An attractive conveniently accessible midsize setting is desperately needed for acts seeking to take advantage of the Staples Center/Nokia Theater buzz and ""fill the seats"" before making the next step, as well as major acts wanting a more intimate stop during their West Coast tour. Not a single venue outside of Downtown can claim such a strategic location as the Variety Arts Theater.Folks, when the Variety Arts Theater renovation is completed and reopens after 2 years of successful performance programming we will donate every year to the boys and girls club of america, elementary schools, high schools and college performing arts programs which is our way of giving back to the community. Our school scholarship fund will provide an opportunity to reach children and adolescents when they are very impressionable and can be guided to work in the creative arts arena or behind the scenes of theater, cinema and television. Back to Top

as we all know, will show what the illustrated postcards do not show. In
principle, they are a sort of ""diary"" of a country that is revealed

</tr></tbody></table>
<p>No momento em que tomamos maior
consciência da irrelevância da politica para uma verdadeira democracia
(preocupada em defender os Mercados e não as pessoas), elementos aparentemente
vulgares, oriundos de 26 países, dão forma a um vídeo artístico chamado <i>Pangea</i>. Ele é uma espécie de <i>Babel</i> contemporânea feita de notícias e
imagens de jornais, imagens turísticas, hinos nacionais, diferentes escritas e
diferentes línguas.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Este meu projecto está a precisar de apoio financeiro para minimizar os custos da realização. Espero poder contar com o seu apoio. </p>
<p>Os donativos são de $5 (3.62 €), $10 (7.25 €),
$20 (14.50 €), $50 (36.20 €) ... até um máximo de $1700 (1237,54 €). </p>

Todas
as contribuições recebem recompensas: impressões de pinturas minhas; nome nos
agradecimentos da obra; desenhos ou pinturas originais da sua preferência
(retratos, por exemplo); e mais. </b></b><p></p><p>Mais abaixo encontra todas as informações sobre o projecto, bem como o que receberá em função da sua contribuição.<br/></p>
<p><b><i><br/></i></b></p>
<p><b><i></i></b></p><h2><strong><strong><strong><strong>PANGEA: a meta<br/></strong></strong></strong></strong></h2><b><span> </span></b>
<p><b><b>O meu nome é Martinho Dias e sou um artista
plástico que trabalha essencialmente com pintura. Em 2007 comecei a recolher
postais turísticos e jornais de diferentes países com vista a um novo projecto,
desta vez em vídeo. </b></b></p>
<p><b><b>Eu queria estabelecer uma relação
entre a vulgaridade dos postais turísticos e o lado cómico, ridículo, banal e também
dramático das imagens e notícias dos jornais. A estes dois elementos,
acrescentei um elemento sonoro e
simbólico, nem sempre pacífico, como é um Hino Nacional. Para além destes
elementos, eu queria integrar outros que contribuem para a identidade de uma nação,
como a história, práticas culturais, realidade actual e linguagem. Era, de
facto, esta espécie de Babel contemporânea que eu queria transportar para uma
obra plástica, em vídeo, feita a partir de jornais, imagens turísticas e hinos
nacionais (cantados <i>a cappella</i> por
cantoras convidadas oriundas de 26 países). </b></b></p>
<p><b><b>O objectivo consiste em realizar uma
obra única e mostrá-la ao maior e mais diversificado número de pessoas – é esta
a principal motivação do meu trabalho. Eu acredito que a obra <i>Pangea</i> levantará um vasto número de
questões que, espero, possam ser discutidas por todos. </b></b></p>
<p><b><b>Na verdade, este meu interesse em
conjugar diferentes realidades, a partir da realidade existente, tem estado
sempre presente na minha pintura. Dada a complexidade do projecto, eu dividi-o
em duas fases – a primeira já está terminada faltando agora realizar a segunda
fase. É para esta fase de conclusão que eu preciso do seu apoio.</b></b></p><p><b><b><br/></b></b></p><span style=""font-style: italic;""></span><h2><b><b><strong><strong><strong><strong>PANGEA: a obra<br/></strong></strong></strong></strong></b></b></h2><b><b></b><b><span>
<p>As diversas imagens que recebi,
representam a face ideal que cada país quer mostrar de si próprio – os postais
ilustrados são isso mesmo – imagens idílicas, ideais, produzidas e pré-seleccionadas.
Talvez sejam um paradoxo por mostrarem a parte como se fosse o todo. Por sua
vez, os jornais, embora sujeitos a variadíssimos filtros e manipulações, como
todos sabemos, mostrarão aquilo que os postais ilustrados não mostram. Por
princípio, eles são uma espécie de “diário” de um país que é revelado todos os
dias através da imagem e da escrita. A minha obra pretende fazer um cruzamento
destes dois auto-retratos – um mais real e o outro mais ideal. </p>
<p>Este projecto em vídeo é um trabalho
artístico que se serve das imagens visuais e mentais, das notícias, do texto
como imagem, da língua e da escrita sobre os quais construirei uma nova imagem.
Para além da imagem, e para que se possa ouvir a língua, escolhi o hino
nacional de cada país, cantado “a capella”, na língua oficial, representando a
identidade e símbolo máximo de cada nação. O hino funcionará como uma espécie
de sussurro a envolver toda a obra ao longo de mais de 30 minutos. Sirvo-me,
portanto, de elementos comuns mas cuja aparente vulgaridade contém muito mais
do que um simples postal ilustrado, um jornal ou uma canção patriótica – como o
é um hino.</p>

<p>O projecto <i>Pangea</i> contou já com a colaboração de Embaixadas, Ministérios,
departamentos de turismo, redacções de jornais e amigos. Também as gravações
dos 26 hinos tiveram o entusiasmo e colaboração das cantoras e agentes musicais
que aceitaram o meu convite. Uma parte dos custos referente à recolha de
material, como despesas de envios, gravação, aluguer de estúdios, foram
suportados por mim próprio, enquanto que noutros casos tive o total apoio das
cantoras e seus agentes, directores e técnicos de gravação.</p>
<p>No seu total, a obra terá cerca de
40 minutos de duração e a primeira metade encontra-se já concluída. Antes de
trabalhar seriamente na promoção, apresentação, participação em eventos,
pagamentos de taxas e em todos os custos que esse processo implica, falta ainda
realizar a segunda parte do trabalho para eu poder dizer – está pronto! Tal
como na primeira metade, esta última fase precisa de um longo trabalho de captação
e tratamento de imagem, tratamento sonoro, montagem e pós-produção vídeo. Todo
este trabalho em falta tem necessariamente de ser feito por profissionais em
audiovisual. </p>
<p>Naturalmente que qualquer apoio será
recompensado e, para isso, procurei as melhores recompensas possíveis.

PANGEA: the goal

My
name’s Martinho Dias, I’m a Portuguese visual artist that
works essentially in painting. In 2007 I started collecting tourist postcards
and newspapers from different countries with a view to a new project, this time
on video. 
I wanted to establish a relationship between the
ordinarity of tourist postcards; the comic, ridiculous, banal
and also dramatic side of newspaper
images and news; a sound and symbolic element, not
always pacific,
as it is a National Anthem. It was,
in fact, this kind of contemporary Babel wanted to carry one to a plastic work in video, made
​​from newspapers,
tourist images and national anthems, sung a cappella by invited female singers coming
from 26 countries.
The purpose is to make
a unique
work and show
it to the largest and most diverse
group of people – this is a major motivation of
my work. I believe the work Pangea raise a large number of questions that
I hope can be discussed by
all.Given the complexity of the project, I divide it into two moments – the first is already finished and the second moment is
instead, lacking now to do the second part. It is for this conclusion phase that I need your support.


PANGEA: the work

For this art project, I
selected a set of 26 countries from different cultural, economic, political,
social and geographical realities. These are realities, along with newspapers,
postcards and hymns that give body to the work. Pangea, as an allusion to the primordial continent. its a kind of Babel of our day which includes different languages (visual, spoken
and written), different cultures, different images, and different realities.
The
several images I received, represents
the ideal face that each country wants to show of itself –
illustrated postcards are just that – idyllic images, ideals and pre-selected.
Perhaps they are a paradox by showing the part as if it were the whole. In
turn, newspapers, although subject to many different filters and manipulations,
as we all know, will show what the illustrated postcards do not show. In
principle, they are a sort of ""diary"" of a country that is revealed
everyday through the image and writing. My work aims to make a comparison of this
two self-portraits – one more real and the other more ideal.This video project is a work of art that serves the mental and visual
images, news, text and image, language and writing on which I will build a new
image. To be able to hear the language, I chose the national anthem of each
country, sung a capella, the official language, representing the
identity and ultimate symbol of each nation. The anthems will act as a sort of
whisper to involve all the work over 40 minutes. I use, therefore, common elements
but whose apparent vulgarity contain much more than a simple postcard, a
newspaper, or a patriotic song – as it is an anthem.

Painting Realities of Reality
(an interview by TV channel - TrofaTV,
by Cátia Veloso and Ana Assunção)
personal website: www.martinhodias.euWhy your support is important?
The
project Pangea had already collaboration
of Embassies, Ministries, departments of tourism,
news rooms in newspapers and friends. Also the recordings of 26 anthems had the
enthusiasm and cooperation of singers and musical agents who accepted my
invitation. A part of this phase concerning the collection of material, such as shipping costs,
recording, studio rental, were supported by myself, while in other cases had
the full support of the singers and their officers, directors and recording
technicians.
In
globally, the work will be about 40 minutes and the first part is
already finished.
Before working seriously in the promotion, presentation, participation
in events, payments of fees and all costs involved in this process, remains
to be done the second part of the work so
that I can said: is ready!

As
in the first half,
this last stage needs a long process of capture and image processing, sound
treatment, assembling and post-production
video. All this work have necessarily to be
done by audiovisual professionals.
– Can I count on you? With your support, this work may ultimately
end up being born and show itself to the world, since its conception 6 years before.

Naturally, any support will
be rewarded, and for that, I looked for the best rewards I was able to give. See, above, what you may receive in return of your contribution.

PANGEA: projecto artístico em vídeo

No momento em que tomamos maior
consciência da irrelevância da politica para uma verdadeira democracia
(preocupada em defender os Mercados e não as pessoas), elementos aparentemente
vulgares, oriundos de 26 países, dão forma a um vídeo artístico chamado Pangea. Ele é uma espécie de Babel contemporânea feita de notícias e
imagens de jornais, imagens turísticas, hinos nacionais, diferentes escritas e
diferentes línguas.

Este meu projecto está a precisar de apoio financeiro para minimizar os custos da realização. Espero poder contar com o seu apoio. 
Os donativos são de $5 (3.62 €), $10 (7.25 €),
$20 (14.50 €), $50 (36.20 €) ... até um máximo de $1700 (1237,54 €). 

Todas
as contribuições recebem recompensas: impressões de pinturas minhas; nome nos
agradecimentos da obra; desenhos ou pinturas originais da sua preferência
(retratos, por exemplo); e mais. Mais abaixo encontra todas as informações sobre o projecto, bem como o que receberá em função da sua contribuição.

PANGEA: a meta 
O meu nome é Martinho Dias e sou um artista
plástico que trabalha essencialmente com pintura. Em 2007 comecei a recolher
postais turísticos e jornais de diferentes países com vista a um novo projecto,
desta vez em vídeo. 
Eu queria estabelecer uma relação
entre a vulgaridade dos postais turísticos e o lado cómico, ridículo, banal e também
dramático das imagens e notícias dos jornais. A estes dois elementos,
acrescentei um elemento sonoro e
simbólico, nem sempre pacífico, como é um Hino Nacional. Para além destes
elementos, eu queria integrar outros que contribuem para a identidade de uma nação,
como a história, práticas culturais, realidade actual e linguagem. Era, de
facto, esta espécie de Babel contemporânea que eu queria transportar para uma
obra plástica, em vídeo, feita a partir de jornais, imagens turísticas e hinos
nacionais (cantados a cappella por
cantoras convidadas oriundas de 26 países). 
O objectivo consiste em realizar uma
obra única e mostrá-la ao maior e mais diversificado número de pessoas – é esta
a principal motivação do meu trabalho. Eu acredito que a obra Pangea levantará um vasto número de
questões que, espero, possam ser discutidas por todos. 
Na verdade, este meu interesse em
conjugar diferentes realidades, a partir da realidade existente, tem estado
sempre presente na minha pintura. Dada a complexidade do projecto, eu dividi-o
em duas fases – a primeira já está terminada faltando agora realizar a segunda
fase. É para esta fase de conclusão que eu preciso do seu apoio.PANGEA: a obra
As diversas imagens que recebi,
representam a face ideal que cada país quer mostrar de si próprio – os postais
ilustrados são isso mesmo – imagens idílicas, ideais, produzidas e pré-seleccionadas.
Talvez sejam um paradoxo por mostrarem a parte como se fosse o todo. Por sua
vez, os jornais, embora sujeitos a variadíssimos filtros e manipulações, como
todos sabemos, mostrarão aquilo que os postais ilustrados não mostram. Por
princípio, eles são uma espécie de “diário” de um país que é revelado todos os
dias através da imagem e da escrita. A minha obra pretende fazer um cruzamento
destes dois auto-retratos – um mais real e o outro mais ideal. 
Este projecto em vídeo é um trabalho
artístico que se serve das imagens visuais e mentais, das notícias, do texto
como imagem, da língua e da escrita sobre os quais construirei uma nova imagem.
Para além da imagem, e para que se possa ouvir a língua, escolhi o hino
nacional de cada país, cantado “a capella”, na língua oficial, representando a
identidade e símbolo máximo de cada nação. O hino funcionará como uma espécie
de sussurro a envolver toda a obra ao longo de mais de 30 minutos. Sirvo-me,
portanto, de elementos comuns mas cuja aparente vulgaridade contém muito mais
do que um simples postal ilustrado, um jornal ou uma canção patriótica – como o
é um hino.

Sobre mim...
A reportagem da TrofaTV: Pintar Realidades e o meu
website www.martinhodias.eu vão
ajudá-lo(a) a conhecer-me melhor. 

Porque é que a sua contribuição é importante?
O projecto Pangea contou já com a colaboração de Embaixadas, Ministérios,
departamentos de turismo, redacções de jornais e amigos. Também as gravações
dos 26 hinos tiveram o entusiasmo e colaboração das cantoras e agentes musicais
que aceitaram o meu convite. Uma parte dos custos referente à recolha de
material, como despesas de envios, gravação, aluguer de estúdios, foram
suportados por mim próprio, enquanto que noutros casos tive o total apoio das
cantoras e seus agentes, directores e técnicos de gravação.
No seu total, a obra terá cerca de
40 minutos de duração e a primeira metade encontra-se já concluída. Antes de
trabalhar seriamente na promoção, apresentação, participação em eventos,
pagamentos de taxas e em todos os custos que esse processo implica, falta ainda
realizar a segunda parte do trabalho para eu poder dizer – está pronto! Tal
como na primeira metade, esta última fase precisa de um longo trabalho de captação
e tratamento de imagem, tratamento sonoro, montagem e pós-produção vídeo. Todo
este trabalho em falta tem necessariamente de ser feito por profissionais em
audiovisual. 
Naturalmente que qualquer apoio será
recompensado e, para isso, procurei as melhores recompensas possíveis.
Veja, abaixo, o que poderá receber em troca da sua contribuição.
Conto com o seu apoio e com a
divulgação do projecto através dos seus contactos. Espero que se sinta

Universidad Pública de Navarra, Galería Canvas, Escuela de Artes, la 
asociación cultural el Vértigo de la Trapecista, librería y espacio

<p>El término Performance, se ha difundido en el ámbito de las artes plásticas a partir de la expresión inglesa <i>performance art</i>
 , con el significado de “arte en vivo”. Esto es lo que va a suceder en 
PIPAF, se realizaran diferentes eventos, muchos de ellos con una 
intención docente pero en los cuales siempre estara presente la acción, 
la corporeidad y su investigación, de la mano de talleres como los que 
tendran lugar en CAC Huarte, Hegan &amp; Dream y quizas más activamente,
 en las acciones de calle que el artista Abel Azcona realizará por el 
casco viejo de Pamplona con todo aquel que quiera asistir al taller. </p>
<p>En PIPAF también habrá cabida para las muestras de trabajos de 
artistas nacionales e internacionales de primera línea en 2014, con performance en vivo, videoperformance y performance art en streaming.<br/></p>
<p>En la edición de 2013, artistas como <b>Maria Jose Arjona</b>,
 artista Colombiana  graduada en 1999 en la Academia de Artes de Bogotá.
 Quería ser bailarina y se preparó para ello. Pero luego descubrió que 
cuerpo y arte podían estar unidos de otra forma: el performance. Sus 
acciones -en las que siempre está ella de cuerpo presente-han sido 
vistas en Colombia, China, varios países de Europa y Estados Unidos, 
donde Arjona vive desde hace diez ańos. Su obra se ha caracterizado por 
su sobriedad y su impacto. Ella misma define su obra con estas palabras:
 “Mi obra tiene un proceso similar al que hace el cuerpo al digerir 
alimentos: pasa de la forma a la síntesis y, como resultado final, 
genera energía"". </p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><p>El artista americano <b>Ron Athey</b>
 también fué una pieza importante dentro de las muestras de 
videoperformance que exhibieron en los espacios participantes. El trabajo de
 Athey explora temas difíciles como las relaciones entre el deseo, la 
sexualidad y la experiencia traumática. Muchos de sus trabajos incluyen 
aspectos relacionados con el sadomasoquismo con el fin de hacer frente a
 las ideas preconcebidas sobre el cuerpo en relación con la masculinidad
 y la iconografía religiosa.  Con ideas relacionadas con el accionismo 
vienes, Athey usa su cuerpo como soporte para la práctica artística, en 
muchos caso también el dolor como via para comunicarse con el público. 
Actualmente vive en Inglaterra y es colaborador habitual de revistas y 
periódicos como LA Weekly.</p>

 Es considerado un artista interdisciplinar pero su principal campo de 
actuacción es el de la performance, sin embargo Azcona da una tremenda 
importancia a el soporte y resultado plástico de su obra la cual 
relaciona así con la fotografía, el video, la instalación y la 
escultura. </p><p>Su obra se puede definir bajo dos ejes 
explorados entre sí a través de una constante sinergia: el 
autobiográfico y el crítico. Esto hace que obra sea algo ambigua y esté 
considerada un retrato personal. Utiliza el arte como una herramienta 
crítica y a su vez de autoconocimiento. Su exploración artística 
considerada altamente autobiográfica indaga en su infancia marcada por 
experiencias de abandono y maltrato infantil, siendo su madre biológica 
referente clave de su experiencia y por tanto de su creación artística. 
Azcona es conocido por abordar el dolor y la resistencia física, 
sometiéndose a azotamientos, intoxicaciones, agresiones y diferentes 
torturas tanto físicas como psicológicas y no duda en enfrentarse a sí 
mismo. Azcona cuenta que cuando el dolor interno es tan fuerte, el dolor
 externo llega a desaparecer. En el terreno crítico de su obra, Azcona 
aborda temas como el feminismo, la sexualidad, las desigualdades, la 
política o la religión buscando poner en evidencia estos temas en 
lasociedad. </p><p>Su obra ha sido presentada en diversos museos, 
centros de arte contemporáneo, galerías y espacios artísticos de países 
como España, Portugal, Francia, Italia, Dinamarca, Reino Unido, 
Alemania, Grecia, México, Colombia, Venezuela, Perú, Ecuador, Argentina,
 Estados Unidos, China, Filipinas y Japón.</p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/162211/files/20131029145948-DSC_2213.jpg?1383083988"" src="""" style=""""/><p>El artista español Abel Azcona realizando un performance art en Bogotá (Colombia).</p>
<p>"" En esta sociedad pasteurizada prefiero evocar odio, rechazo, repugnancia, desconcierto, hartazgo, angustia, hostilidad, miedo...que seguir fomentando la asepsia mental"". Con estas palabras se presenta Rocio Boliver, siguiente artista del 2013. Icono de la cultura underground en la ciudad de México, nacida en la misma ciudad en el año 1956. Rocio Boliver es una de las artistas que concentra su propuesta artística en la crítica a las cargas ideológicas represivas que viven las mujeres, principalmente en México.<br/></p>

</div></div>","Our StoryThe Retreat at Pointer's Ridge is a regional center for artists and other creatives to work, reflect, share; a rural place to escape the noise of every day; a place to walk in nature and find time and focus to ignite a creative spark. 

Located in the Big Sioux River Valley of Southeast South Dakota, The Retreat brings together artists, creators, inventors, writers, growers, artisans, chefs; creatives in all walks of life. Cultivation and support of new ideas is heightened when the distractions of daily life are minimized, in a natural setting that clears the mind.
What's Done





We've cleaned up 13 of 21 acres on The Retreat campus; painted building outsides to cover graffiti; completed rehab on a large main hall which is now ready for seasonal events, art exhibits, and community gatherings. The A-frame has been rehabbed and outfitted with heating and plumbing to serve as a temporary home for our first artist in residence.



What We Hope to Do
There are 8 16 x 24' cabins that still need work.  Our goal is to finish one of these cabins to make it ready for year-round use before year's end.  



The plan for this cabin is shown below; it has been dubbed ""The Writer's Cabin"".



Our Budget


How You Can Help!
 Help get the word out; make some noise about the importance of this investment in the arts and culture of southeastern South Dakota; be a contributor at whatever level is most comfortable.
Use the Indiegogo share tools to tell your friends about this innovative opportunity to enhance the regional arts community!  
And in the meantime, come to visit; walk along the river; forge a path through the woods; play in the natural sand pile.  This is already a great place to be!",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
My name is James and I had the idea for the Lightbulb Festival around May 2012 - I wanted to realise a dream of the community arts groups in the town working together to deliver something to the public that showcases all that is good about the town; not only that, allowing them the chance to get involved at a participation level.</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
I need around £500-1000 to cover the costs of running the festival - this includes things like insurance, venue hire, paying performers and equipment, as well as advertising. We have already received £750 and for the festival to be a success need that little bit extra!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Lightbulb Festival is unique in that it incorporates a number of different groups under one banner in Colchester across 4 days, with events including burlesque, film, music (classical and popular), poetry, spoken word and a outdoor carnival-style celebration. Funds will go directly into making these a complete success at little cost to the public.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you choose to donate you will receive thanks in the festival literature and depending on the size of your donation you will also be named as an official festival sponsor (donations of £25.00 and over). We also offer commemorative badges and programmes for you to keep simply by donating.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
I have been involved with the running of two community arts groups in Colchester, covering poetry and comedy. I host four events a month that incorporate a number of different disciplines at little to no cost to the public, allowing the chance for local performers to be given the opportunity to be given a stage. Both spectator and performer numbers have been good and I estimate I have worked with around 100 people in the last year to deliver grassroots events to the town and would like to continue to do so.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Lightbulb Festival will be of great benefit to Colchester and to the region as a whole in that it brings to the for the diverse range of talent from the area and acts as a spur for the public to get involved themselves with their local groups, cultivating an organic arts scene that is collaborative and cohesive.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
Simply spread the word about the Lightbulb Festival! I truly believe in this project and want it to be a success and for it to reach as many people as possible, showing that working together in your local area really isn't that difficult and when you do, you can deliver something spectacular.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sites such as Indiegogo are a great place to go if you've got a project you believe in and want to get off the ground and I hope you're able to help me with this project.</div>

artists.</p><p>With <strong>STREET PUBLICATION, </strong><strong>AFRIKADAA</strong> exposes its content through the city of Dakar, as a live editorial act, a curatorial concept created by the magazine. <br/><br/>Team <strong>AFRIKADAA</strong> in collaborations with artists, offer professional art and Senegalese public to be involved in their publication via this exhibition. </p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b><u>THE EXHIBITION:</u></b></p><p>The exhibition <strong>STREET PUBLICATION</strong> represents the extension of the contents of the magazine in the public space. An innovative way of designing editorial content. <br/>Text and photos on posters, PVC, different screen sizes and illuminated signs will be installed for the biennale. A google map will be offered in order to take you to surprising exhibitions places, invested by artists <strong>JAY ONE</strong> and <strong>SEAN HART</strong>. <br/>Publi-twitter is an opportunity for visitors to tweet on the biennale events, to share what they like or unlike instantly.

<p></p></div>","OUR GREAT PROJECT:AFRIKADAA THE STREET PUBLICATION EXHIBITION 
We are very
delighted to have been selected for the official programmation of the DAK’ART
2014 Biennale, the oldest and most respected event dedicated to contemporary
art on the continent.  
In this
context, AFRIKADAA, as the first bilingual magazine on African and diasporic
contemporary arts, organizes a series of conferences, and an exhibition around
the future of art publications in Africa and the diaspora. The conference  ""Memory of the future"" to be held on 13 and 14 May 2014 will
be attended by art historians, editors, curators, writers, art critics and
artists.With STREET PUBLICATION, AFRIKADAA exposes its content through the city of Dakar, as a live editorial act, a curatorial concept created by the magazine. Team AFRIKADAA in collaborations with artists, offer professional art and Senegalese public to be involved in their publication via this exhibition. 

THE EXHIBITION:The exhibition STREET PUBLICATION represents the extension of the contents of the magazine in the public space. An innovative way of designing editorial content. Text and photos on posters, PVC, different screen sizes and illuminated signs will be installed for the biennale. A google map will be offered in order to take you to surprising exhibitions places, invested by artists JAY ONE and SEAN HART. Publi-twitter is an opportunity for visitors to tweet on the biennale events, to share what they like or unlike instantly. Create editorial content via live tweets (#AfrikadaaStreetPublication).Interactivity of live, another way to see the publication ... This project is a first for the Dakar Biennale. 
IT WILL LOOK LIKE THIS:Yes Future!, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 2011 © Sean Hart
We now,
need your help to fund the production of the exhibition and the street art
works to be exhibited. 
THE DETAILS:
The issue at stake here is:
Provide art professionals and Senegalese public to be involved in our publication
The use of digital technologies and social media as a means of education and interaction, within an artistic context and beyond.
""If the people don’t come to us, we will go to them.""In this way, the public will be able:
To see the work in public spaces invested by artists, touching and touch them.
Become familiar with contemporary art
Scroll the magazine’s previous issues on ipads 
Read articles projected on the walls,
Questioning the contents of AFRIKADAA, much like a game of itineraries build by the viewer himself 
They will be able to contribute to the discussion by sending live tweets, which will be broadcast in several spots across Dakar
Digital and paper maps will be available at the different venues, so everybody can play the game and follow their own itinerary"" This is our way of democratizing art, make it fit in the daily life of Dakar citizen. ""

When you look at the history of Las Vegas, there is not much more than mobsters, movie stars, and millionaires. However, there is one interesting part of the city that makes it so much of what it is, and in recent years, has seen a new-found adoration from its citizens: Atomic weapons testing. In the height of the Manhattan project, Las Vegas found itself just miles away from some of the most rigorous and extensive nuclear testing to be done in the mainland United States.The explosions became part of life in Las Vegas. Citizens embraced and assimilated them into everyday life. They held ""Miss Atomic"" pageants, had atomic cocktails, and even had bleachers on Fremont Street for atomic blast watching parties. The tests, and the culture they created, shaped what Las Vegas was and has become. In recent years, the citizens of this desert oasis have embraced their history, and a sort of ""Atomic Revival"" has been born. Through art, music, and culture, the aesthetics of the atomic age are as much a part of life in Las Vegas today as they were in the 50’s. And so, we felt nothing was more appropriate to represent Las Vegas than a giant, unexploded nuclear ordnance.What we are building:The structure will consist of three pieces: the body, the spherical joint, and the tail-fin. The tail will feature flame effects consisting of one large fire poofer surrounded by four smaller ones.A neon sign will be in the center of the front panels and LED strips will run up the sides of each panel.Suspended in the center of the hull, the Atomic Chandelier will pulsate as it shifts through the three hues in our color pallet: red, yellow and white. The whole inside will glow in a uniform color to mimic the core reactor.
Why Donate?Your donation will help bring this fun interactive sculpture to the playa to meet a gratuitously violent end! Just look at all the great things you can do with it:
Step inside to feel the warm and loving embrace of the radiation
Learn proper nuclear survival techniques
Measure your radiation levels
Experience the cold, harsh sterility of our decontamination process
See how far into the ground you can get the bomb to burrow without blowing up using our remote jet controls!
Watch in suspense to see if our highly-trained cleanup crew can properly dispose of the atomic threat by the end of the week. We've never had the same crew twice...
Experience:The experience aspect of this piece will be intricate to convey our story. Inside the sculpture will be small televisions that will display era footage, atomic test clips, and duck and cover videos. There will also be displays depicting how to survive a nuclear blast. The fuel depot will also have an educational aspect as a time capsule of sorts.Throughout the week we will also hold themed burlesque, cabaret, and parties to entertain and tell the story of the time. The installation makes a powerful statement about the brutality of nuclear weapons and what once was the American Dream. That perfect time in American history, the Atomic Age.

me.  I cannot imagine another way of
life.  I am now at a point where I am
invited to exhibit in venues (I had only dreamed of) worldwide, but
unfortunately I find myself unable to fund my travel to the most prestigious
shows of my career due to the economical downturn. </p>

</div></div>","Opening Statement

My name is Margaret La Bounty and I have been a professional artist for over thirty years.  I have been invited to exhibit my art in what is being called “most prestigious art event in the world: Exposition at the Eiffel Tower.”  This exposition is
part of the 125th celebration of the Eiffel tower and they have
invited “The most important artists in the world to participate at ""La Grande Exposition Universelle"" to be held inside the Eiffel Tower, “Gustave
Eiffel” Hall on the first floor.  


The event will be
October 23rd and I would love to be there so I need everyone’s help
to achieve my goal of attending this prestigious and historical event in the
Eiffel Tower in Paris.  Unfortunately the
travel costs are not covered through the invitation.  I am so excited for this great opportunity and I ask for your help. 

I am so honored
to have received this invitation after working a lifetime in the arts.  For your help, some will receive a beautiful original piece of my art. 
There will be a
reception on the evening of October 22nd.  The Celebration and Exhibition will be all
day the 23rd.  I will be
representing myself along with representing a US artist from Council Bluffs,
Iowa.  
In addition “the
art magazine Effetto Arte, will dedicate the September/October issue to the selected artists, exponents of the new artistic trends.” 
I was selected as one of the cover artists and the magazine will be
available at the event. 

Who am I and Why Me:

I am Margaret La
Bounty and I have been a professional artist for more than 30 years. I started
my career in the Southwest and have continued in art no matter where my life has taken
me.  I cannot imagine another way of
life.  I am now at a point where I am
invited to exhibit in venues (I had only dreamed of) worldwide, but
unfortunately I find myself unable to fund my travel to the most prestigious
shows of my career due to the economical downturn. 
   What I Need & What You Get Going to Paris is very expensive.  I need $5,500 US.  
That consists of airfare, hotel, expenses, food, shipping, and canvas preparation and stretching in Paris.  
Airfare: Flights from Omaha to Paris average $1,400 or more
 Hotel: Average $250 to $300 Euros per night.  Total of $1,800
Food: Eating in Paris is very expensive in the Eiffel Tower area.  Cost of 100 Euros per day.  Total: $700
Expenses: Taxi, tips, luggage charges and incidentals.  $500
Shipping of art to and from Paris:  Painting will be rolled to reduce cost.  $500
Canvas removal and stretching and removal:  Stretched canvas has to be removed, rolled, restretched and then the process is repeated to ship back to US.  $600
Your donation is so important to me and I am willing to share my art to Patrons by offering both copies and original pieces of my art!  Your help is so critical.  I am expecting to reach my goal and represent the US in this great honor.  Any and all funds will first go to shipping my painting and then assisting my travel expenses to Paris.  
  The Impact This type of event only comes once in a lifetime.  Very few artists were invited from the US and I am proud for the representation.  This will give me the opportunity to maintain a International stature.  Please look at my web site www.labounty.com/career/ in the section under Career to see my accomplishments.  I thank you so much for your consideration.

Without using any power, this studio design will allow me 6 hours or more of usable light. Inside the current house presents me different challenges (though, I truly appreciate what is here and usable). I've moved to every room, tried every angle, lied on my stomach and stood on my tippy toes. I moved it under the eves and then into a greenhouse, and tried many different lightbulbs, but the two hour allotment of perfect light was not enough per day to keep up with demand, the set up isn't enough to keep my brushes clean, and the finished paintings aren't protected the way that keeps momentum going.  <br/></b></p><p><b style=""font-size: 10px; line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Reclaimed Materials</b> - We plan on reclaiming a lot of materials for the creation of this studio. We already have a large 'porch' windows, all the exterior wood, the trailer, work sink, greenhouse safety glass for the 'South facing' roof, and some hardware. </b></p><p><b style=""font-size: 10px; line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Open Floor Plan</b> - This allows me to travel anywhere in the building with, or without my work table. </b></p><p><b style=""font-size: 10px; line-height: 1.45em;""><b>Versatility</b> - Perhaps my favorite feature is the ability for it to convert to a low-power photography (my main mode of income) 'lightbox', an animation studio (my other Artistic love), and live space.

Additionally, I'd like to paint storms without soaking my paper:) I graduated from Rhode Island School of Design in 2003 in 'film, video and animation' and went to a great animation job soon after. However, to make a ten-year-long story short, I ended up back in Maine with a innate need to work on my own projects, but lacking the desire to market myself. Year after year the only truly enjoyable work that kept me going - without any publicity - seemed to be the family-networked sale of my watercolor paintings and cards. I appreciated this income but did not realize how important it could be to my career until a few weeks ago... Then it hit me! Full-time art is what I want to do...this little studio will allow me to live and work with little overhead, essential storage, and a unique mobile attribute. With your eager help, I'll be on my way to building a small studio that allows me freedom to paint during foul weather, provides me with a non-toxic work environment, and is cost-efficient. Help me achieve total art euphoria by involving yourself in this project! Everyday you could walk by your new painting and smile at the thought of what YOU created!Act now! Share with anyone you know who enjoys artwork such as this! https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/painting-myself-into-a-studio/x/6787543  Keep the momentum going! Please donate if you like the idea and are able! Follow us on our social media outlets to stay updated! Receive my personalized paintings and know that, everyday, your support allowed for more, better artwork. The plan: I have designed my ideal tiny live/work studio with all the amennities this specific artist could ask for. With our combined powers we'll bring this studio to fruition. You'll get paintings, cards, and books and I'll be able to make more art - comfortably, inexpensively, and self-reliantly! The studio design features easy mobility and great views for painting in unpredictable weather, and is conducive to my animation and photography as well. We have many materials collected over years, we have studied and drafted design after design, and now it's time to build!All I need now is the quick injection of financial steroids to enact the plan to its entirety. That's where you're help is essential!The act: We plan to begin serious building as soon as the funds hit the account (May 5th estimated) and finish by September 2014. Once the studio is complete, I'll be able to focus on my painting, stop-motion animation, and my photography in ways I haven't been able to since leaving school! My mission is to paint wholeheartedly for whomever donates. I want you to feel my gratitude each time you look at the very paintings that you helped create!Other Ways to Help:Please don't feel pressure to donate, I'll appreciate any inspired action you can muster up! You can go outside and enjoy the scenery (yes, somehow knowing others are enjoying nature helps me paint) or you can tell friends and family, or share through Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest, (please ""pin"" any image you like especially if you link it back here or to my site!) and other social media outlets. I'd really appreciate any beneficial action, truly! How it Works Unless I hear from you, I'll send the matted painting out as soon as I can paint it after your donation. OR, you can choose to wait until I'm able to experience the new studio lighting and layout! (If so, paintings with this option will be delivered in Sept. 2014). If you pick a perk that gives you two paintings, you can have one painted in my current situation and one painted after the conditions are improved to show your precise improvements to my artistry!Perks for You: Each painting will be genuinely created just for you (or as a gift for a loved one), so please feel free to tell me about yourself or your favorite view or outdoor scene! From large paintings to teeny paintings and books, everyone involved will walk away with an investment in my future and your own. The more my paintings are desired, the more yours is worth! Any gift amount will receive the option to have thanks noted on my website's Indiegogo page also (though it's not noted in each perk, it's true for all levels). Shipping is included already and can be to anywhere in the World. Where funds will go if goals are not reached: Every penny will still go toward the described event...it may just take us more time to achieve the desired results and you'll still get your painting(s)! We'll get this studio built no matter what! Studio Features:Big windows intended for panoramic view - Though preferred, outside painting has proven unreliable due to the coastal Maine weather. In fact, one of our sayings is: ""Don't like the weather? Wait a minute!"" And then there's the wind, oh, the wind...I love it personally but it's tough to paint my favorite scenes in the midst of it. These big windows will allow me to paint our crazy storms...during them. Mmmmm:) I can't wait! Thank you!Mobility - Using a donated camper trailer (don't worry, it's sound!) and our trusty Toyota truck, we'll tote this mobile studio all around Acadia National Park and elsewhere in Maine. (Thank you Mom, for the year long park pass!)Indirect and North Light - Skylights, tiny windows up top, and side windows will help me achieve lighting conditions ideal for my work. Without using any power, this studio design will allow me 6 hours or more of usable light. Inside the current house presents me different challenges (though, I truly appreciate what is here and usable). I've moved to every room, tried every angle, lied on my stomach and stood on my tippy toes. I moved it under the eves and then into a greenhouse, and tried many different lightbulbs, but the two hour allotment of perfect light was not enough per day to keep up with demand, the set up isn't enough to keep my brushes clean, and the finished paintings aren't protected the way that keeps momentum going.  Reclaimed Materials - We plan on reclaiming a lot of materials for the creation of this studio. We already have a large 'porch' windows, all the exterior wood, the trailer, work sink, greenhouse safety glass for the 'South facing' roof, and some hardware. Open Floor Plan - This allows me to travel anywhere in the building with, or without my work table. Versatility - Perhaps my favorite feature is the ability for it to convert to a low-power photography (my main mode of income) 'lightbox', an animation studio (my other Artistic love), and live space. Wake up, paint, eat lunch, photograph, eat dinner, animate, sleep. YES! Your Longterm ImpactThe impact you'll be making within just my own life is profound (and deeply motivating, thank you), but the impact we both can have on the Art World and web presentation of Art is astounding! Though John Singer Sargent or Winslow Homer (two favorite Painters of mine) never did social media, I wonder if they would have passed up an Indiegogo campaign? I'm taking my tentative step toward an online presence in the hopes I can maintain the same quality of work and reach that authenticity that 19th and 20th century Painters would appreciate.When cameras didn't exist people either remembered, drew or painted the subject, or told stories. John Singer Sargent and Winslow Homer are great examples of how one simple color study can become a memorable place-marker in history, a record for the weather, landscape, and the times. I'm hoping to continue the tradition of painting landscapes before they're altered, landscapes that are now undoubtably, bound to change. The long term ramifications of letting a rampant landscape painter out in this modern World have yet to be discovered! Let's find out what we're both capable of in this evolving Art world! Your support is genuinely appreciated! Thank you so much.  Emily Dodge (Artist) and Nicholas Newenham (Web Developer)How will we build a studio with our limited knowledge? We began by practicing on Chicken coops and pens, Guinea Fowl Houses, and then Rabbit Barns. Now we're applying all research, our our already-obtained materials, and our passion for our work to create this specialized live/work studio! Thank YOU for your help in this endeavor!",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>Philosophical Statement
</b></p>
<p>It is our mission to become a Healing Art Performance installation, a space open to all cultures,
empowering new rituals and techniques, which we can incorporate into our daily lives. This will be
achieved through the multiplicity in Healing, Art and Performance. Gathering a visionary collective
combining each medium and discipline together in a Lotus Flower Structure, offering all the participants
that enter the HAPi Experience and the tools needed to bring about a positive change in their lives, as
well as in the society and the world we all live in and interact with.
</p>
<p>Art is the universal communication with which we can transcend borders and cultures. It forms in
multiple expression of the soul, enabling us to reach the very core of those that observe and participate.
From the depths of silence the melody of creation is translated into Healing, Art, Performance, dance,
music, storytelling, spoken word and many other forms of artistic expressions. Each forms into a unique
fingerprint in the gallery of time. This multifaceted art acts as a mirror and guide to the rituals and
experiences of life through our multiple perceptions, and <b>HAP</b>i Experience intends to become the
launchpad for these unique expressions to fuse as one for all that enter to embrace and interact with
it. Creating a shelter for all participants that provides a space of love and unity. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Philosophy of the Lotus</b></span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<div>
<div>
<p>“Lotus rises from unclean water to blossom as a pure, uncontaminated flower, it is a symbol of purity
and resurrection. In the same way the lotus flower goes through much in its growth before emerging
from dirty water to become a beautiful flower, the individual consciousness does the same on its path
to enlightenment as the so-called impurities of unenlightened thinking gradually fade.
</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The lotus is one of the eight auspicious signs of Buddhism and Hinduism, and the eight-petal lotus
seen in Buddhist mandalas stands for the cosmic harmony between all. Mandalas are geometric
patterns used as symbolic or meta-physical representations of the universe, the spiritual path, etcetera;
mandalas are often used as an object of focus to aid in meditation. The eight petals of the white lotus
correspond to the Noble Eightfold Path of the Good Law. This lotus is found at the heart of the
Garbhadhatu Mandala, regarded as the womb or embryo of the world.”</span><br/></p>
<p><b>Physical description
</b></p>
<p><b>HAP</b>i Experience is a bespoke, high end, 12m diameter / 9m high inflatable designed by Michael Fung, Coralie Consigny and Architect Ian Flood With lighting installation by Chris Levine. The design
itself is based around the structure of a lotus flower, which represents purity and rebirthing in Vedic
and Buddhist philosophy.
</p>
<p>The installation has dual features. The first being the rooms inside the space divided by inflatable walls
attached by Velcro. This enables us to create independent spaces for Healing, Art and various
empowering workshops. The central area will be the lounge, and also act as the space for live painting
and performance art shows, as well as the fruit juice bar. The flooring will be two layers, with
unbreathable recycled tarpaulin underneath and a top layer of recycled carpet covering the whole
surface area. The installation consist out of rip-stop nylon and stands out beautifully well as broken-
white lotus with an eco-logical and natural silk look.
</p>
<p>The second feature is the installation as an interactive Art piece that meta-morphs from day to night
the outer petals are up during the day to increase ventilation and shade, and lowered at night to create
a the full form of the lotus flower as well as increased illumination. The installation will be illuminated
by LEDs, Laser pods and low powered lighting for effects, there will be a gallery featuring small to medium sized
hexagonal canvas which will feature Art by our in-house Visionary Artists as well as the Art from the art
workshops and participants at Burning Man. There will also be EL wire sculptures in various areas of
the installation which will be designed and produced by live sculpture workshops and the burner
participants and artists. </p>

mandalas are often used as an object of focus to aid in meditation. The eight petals of the white lotus
correspond to the Noble Eightfold Path of the Good Law. This lotus is found at the heart of the
Garbhadhatu Mandala, regarded as the womb or embryo of the world.”
Physical description

HAPi Experience is a bespoke, high end, 12m diameter / 9m high inflatable designed by Michael Fung, Coralie Consigny and Architect Ian Flood With lighting installation by Chris Levine. The design
itself is based around the structure of a lotus flower, which represents purity and rebirthing in Vedic
and Buddhist philosophy.

The installation has dual features. The first being the rooms inside the space divided by inflatable walls
attached by Velcro. This enables us to create independent spaces for Healing, Art and various
empowering workshops. The central area will be the lounge, and also act as the space for live painting
and performance art shows, as well as the fruit juice bar. The flooring will be two layers, with
unbreathable recycled tarpaulin underneath and a top layer of recycled carpet covering the whole
surface area. The installation consist out of rip-stop nylon and stands out beautifully well as broken-
white lotus with an eco-logical and natural silk look.

The second feature is the installation as an interactive Art piece that meta-morphs from day to night
the outer petals are up during the day to increase ventilation and shade, and lowered at night to create
a the full form of the lotus flower as well as increased illumination. The installation will be illuminated
by LEDs, Laser pods and low powered lighting for effects, there will be a gallery featuring small to medium sized
hexagonal canvas which will feature Art by our in-house Visionary Artists as well as the Art from the art
workshops and participants at Burning Man. There will also be EL wire sculptures in various areas of
the installation which will be designed and produced by live sculpture workshops and the burner
participants and artists.

<h2><strong>If during any chemical reaction, matter is neither created nor destroyed, at what point does an abstraction become unnatural?</strong></h2>
<p>Turf, cars, cement, shoes, plastic — these materials that humans invent are also appropriations of preexisting elements on our planet.  We use them to facilitate, protect, and regulate our interactions with the fecundity of the wilderness.  In turn, they also become the systems and standards for what it means to be a developed country or ‘civilized’ society.   </p>
<p>We project a sort of collective self-consciousness of our primal origins through the creation and fetishization of status symbols.  The material goods to which we attribute excess monetary value separate us from our environment and help us feel further removed from a 'savage.'  By attempting to elevate our human experience, we become psychologically disconnected from nature.  Rather than being a part of it, we turn it into something external requiring control.</p>
<p>These modes of separation form the basis for the media in Margaret Wingard’s upcoming debut solo exhibition, <i>Deluxed</i>.  This show marks a major shift and milestone in Wingard’s art practice.  Not only is it her first solo exhibition, but it also involves working with a broad range of new materials. The concept informs the compositions and physical makeup of each piece, rather than a singular aesthetic preference.  </p>
<p>La Maison invites you to participate in the creation of this body of work and to help transform this artist-run initiative into a visual arts space.  The cost of the physical production to create rugs, metal replications of paintings, an altar, sculptural car forms, etc. is much higher than that of the average art show, and any little bit you are able to contribute would go far to make this concept a reality.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>About the Artist:</strong></h3>
<p>Margaret Wingard (b. 1989) is an emerging artist from Baltimore, MD, living and working in San Francisco.  She studied at The University of Tasmania’s School of Visual and Performing Arts in Australia and Towson University’s School of Fine Arts in Baltimore, Maryland.  Her work investigates suggestions of traditional media and methods of art-making through the use of alternative materials— namely abstract embroidery and site-specific string installations inspired by 3-D imagery.  Through extensive travel, she researches the importance of textiles to convey cultural heritage and identity. Her work has been exhibited both nationally and internationally.  She recently was the Arquetopia Foundation’s artist-in-residence in Oaxaca, Mexico, where she studied traditional methods of embroidery and semantics in pre-Hispanic iconography. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>About the Venue:</strong></h3>
<p>La Maison Oakland is an artist-run initiative, venue, and residency, that provides a space for artists to meet, collaborate, perform, and exhibit. Founded in 2016 by Mathilde Froustey, Principle Dancer at SF Ballet, its projects and events rely exclusively on crowdfunding. </p>

The quantities and sizes available are based on the canvases I already have on hand. I will be giving 100% of the money raised to my sister, so I don't want to have to purchase too much stuff to do this. Shipping within the U.S. will be included in the cost, and I will cover the shipping costs out of my own pocket. If you need shipping outside the U.S. let me know and I will tell you how much extra to add to your donation. </p><p>All paintings will be done acrylic on gallery wrapped 3/4"" canvas, and all will have hanging hardware installed when you receive them. They will also be varnished for protection. What you get will be up to you. I will try my best to capture your vision in my own style. There are just a few things I am unable/unwilling to do:</p><p>- For the purposes of this campaign I will not be able to do recognizable portraits of specific people. They take me way too long to finish, and I am never really happy with them. Generic human/humanoid creatures are fine. I.E. Barack Obama riding a skateboard: no, but Santa Claus holding a basket of kittens would be fine. I can also do pet portraits! </p><p>- I am also not willing to do anything that I deem crude or offensive. If you're not sure, feel free to ask before backing. Seriously though, look at my portfolio in the video. If you want something gross or sleazy painted, there are other artists who could do a better job than me. </p><p>- Lastly, be aware that anything I paint is going to look like I painted it. I'm not going to do an exact copy of the Mona Lisa or a Thomas Kinkade painting, nor can I work in that style, so don't ask. I mean, technically I suppose I could. I just don't want to. If you want the Mona Lisa as interpreted by Christel, I can do that. </p><p> </p><p>I do have a few 6"" by 6"" paintings that are already complete or close to complete, which I will be offering at a reduced price (yay!). The catch is that which one you get will be a total and complete surprise. I am also offering open edition 5"" by 7"" glossy prints of a selection of my older paintings at the awesome price of any two for $15, which includes shipping.

The quantities and sizes available are based on the canvases I already have on hand. I will be giving 100% of the money raised to my sister, so I don't want to have to purchase too much stuff to do this. Shipping within the U.S. will be included in the cost, and I will cover the shipping costs out of my own pocket. If you need shipping outside the U.S. let me know and I will tell you how much extra to add to your donation. All paintings will be done acrylic on gallery wrapped 3/4"" canvas, and all will have hanging hardware installed when you receive them. They will also be varnished for protection. What you get will be up to you. I will try my best to capture your vision in my own style. There are just a few things I am unable/unwilling to do:- For the purposes of this campaign I will not be able to do recognizable portraits of specific people. They take me way too long to finish, and I am never really happy with them. Generic human/humanoid creatures are fine. I.E. Barack Obama riding a skateboard: no, but Santa Claus holding a basket of kittens would be fine. I can also do pet portraits! - I am also not willing to do anything that I deem crude or offensive. If you're not sure, feel free to ask before backing. Seriously though, look at my portfolio in the video. If you want something gross or sleazy painted, there are other artists who could do a better job than me. - Lastly, be aware that anything I paint is going to look like I painted it. I'm not going to do an exact copy of the Mona Lisa or a Thomas Kinkade painting, nor can I work in that style, so don't ask. I mean, technically I suppose I could. I just don't want to. If you want the Mona Lisa as interpreted by Christel, I can do that.  I do have a few 6"" by 6"" paintings that are already complete or close to complete, which I will be offering at a reduced price (yay!). The catch is that which one you get will be a total and complete surprise. I am also offering open edition 5"" by 7"" glossy prints of a selection of my older paintings at the awesome price of any two for $15, which includes shipping. Available options can be seen in the gallery. I will be completing each painting in the order that they are backed. So if you are the first to back, your painting will be finished and mailed off first, and if you are third, yours will be third, and so on. I cannot start anyone's painting until they let me know what they want though, so make sure to do that when the campaign is completed. If you need your painting by a specific date, let me know and I will do my best to get it to you in time.  Thank you for checking out my campaign, and please share this widely!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Overview</p>
<p>HomeBase Theatre Collective began to plant its roots in the summer of 2016. It is a black artists initiative where artistic fellowship and unflinching exploration of theatrical works is used to open conversation and opportunities for the next generation of artists. In this first year, we have collaborated with 8 NYC black playwrights who have created work for over 30 current black NYU and Juilliard actors, directed by black directors. Each piece is about 10-15 minutes in length, and culminates in SOLD OUT performances of all the pieces on January 8th, 2017 (2pm and 7pm) at Juilliard.</p>
<p>Especially now, in the midst of massive political change and paradigm shifts on the social level, this collective could not be more timely. As young, informed, and politically engaged artists, we are actively telling stories and creating possibilities for a new generation of black theatre makers.</p>
<p>The diversity of ideas already being put into play in this first year- with almost 50 artists of color in one room- fortifies us in the conviction that exciting and necessary art can, will and must happen.</p>
<p>Goals</p>
<p>1. To create a home and company for young black theatre artists to “work through” ideas in a space that allows them to explore, fail, and surge past their expectations</p>
<p>2. To push our conceptions of what theatre can be to its limit, by putting on plays by black artists that are told in unexplored ways.</p>
<p>3. To compete (from the Latin: to seek together) for nuanced truth through artistic excellence</p>
<p>4. To Form fellowships with high school artists seeking to enter theatre through the models of peer mentorship and rehearsal shadowing</p>
<p>WHAT WE NEED </p>
<p>The first bit of business for HomeBase is our teaching intensive with high school students and HomeBase ensemble members, which will be initiated by a 2-week summer theatre camp with 10-12 students. Because the students we want to form fellowships with will not have the ability to pay for such an intensive, it is imperative that we receive this funding through grants and contributions. We are in the process of applying to several grants and foundations to help us make this free of charge to students while also paying teaching artists for their time, but we also need your help to make that happen! </p>
<p><strong>$5000 will fund one student for this 9-month mentorship. With your support, $10,000+ will get us on the road to not only paying our teaching artists for their hard work, but also paying for the free education of our mentees. </strong>These youth will get to work with professional black actors and grad students, as they train them in movement, speech and acting. They will have one-on-one discussions with their HomeBase mentors, who will help them set up a game plan for their senior year, and set goals that they can check up on them with throughout the year. They will also get a crash course on creating their own work, to help them obtain agency as each student gets ready to move on to his/her next stage in life. </p>
<p>Please help us cultivate the next generation of artists with this generation of imaginative storytellers! </p>

</div><p> </p><h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>On March 1st 2015, Charlie Warner and 
Geordie Palmer have decided to take a break from their 4th year 
degrees/soup making and run the Bath Half Marathon for a wonderful 
cause- The Lalela Project. </p>
<p>The Lalela Project is very close to Charlie who, whilst growing up 
spending lots of time with family in Cape Town, has been fortunate 
enough to work for this fantastic charity which provides educational 
arts to at-risk youth in order to spark creative 
thinking and awaken entrepreneurial spirit.</p>

<p>100% of the funds raised will be going to the Lalela Project.</p><p><br/></p>
<p></p><h3>The Impact<br/>
</h3>Lalela Project provides art-risk youth with innovative arts 
education to spark creative thinking and awaken the entrepreneurial 
spirit! Lalela believes in the power of arts education to empower 
students to map and manifest a better future for themselves and their 
communities. <br/><br/>At-risk students highly engaged in arts education 
are 2x more likely than their peers to graduate college, 3x more likely 
to win an award for school attendance or be elected to class office and 
5x less likely to drop out of school. <br/><br/>In the communities where 
Lalela works, these benefits of arts education are making a difference 
for kids who were unable to imagine a better future. In South Africa and
 the South Bronx, gang violence, gender discrimination and sexual 
violence are daily obstacles to reaching their full potential - or even 
reaching their school grounds. In Northern Uganda, Lalela works with 
former child soldiers and orphans from the conflict to develop the 
creativity and independence that the decades long conflict dangerously 
damaged. Art allows these students a space where they are safe and 
encouraged to see beyond their present circumstances. Art provides a 
venue for expression where there are no right or wrong answers and 
students can develop the courage of their convictions. Lalela students 
are the star pupils in their classrooms and excited to go to school - 
they will be the entrepreneurs and change makers in their communities.

      What we need and what you get

Philip has been developing Eagle Africa since 2011 with sponsorship and support from the Goethe Institute of Accra, Ghana, and select portions of the project from Erwin und Gisela von Steiner Stiftung Munich, and Senat der LH Berlin. 
The project  ""Bushwalden"" was executed within global art – local view and financed by the GiZ (Gesellschaft fuer internationale Zusammenarbeit).For the final steps of preparing the project to be exhibited, however, Philip needs your help. The funds raised will finance Philip's solo exhibition of this project at the Goethe Institute of Accra, Ghana a the end of April 2014. Funds are needed to cover the printing of large scale photographs, framing expenses, and the shipping of select artworks from Germany to Ghana, and back. These expenses will be covered by the first 4000 € raised through this campaign. Another 1,500 € will enable Philip to produce a publication on the project, and the historical context with which it deals. Part of this has already been financed from the Goethe Institut. The publication will include commentary from various Ghanian and German art and academic historians.





Philip would also like to add two additional 3-dimensional artworks to the project. These will be financed if the project budget exceeds 9,000 €. Furthermore, Philip and his team are  planning to eventually produce a documentary video on Eagle Africa and the location Gross-Fiedrichsburg. If the funds raise exceed 9,000 €, this will enable Philip to produce a short film/ teaser for the documentary video, with which he can apply for larger-scale funding in Germany in the future.

He is a musician and also he produces the Bagsand clothes you can see on the photo. They are now available as perks of the project!





The effect of the Project
The confrontation of this largely unknown German history in West Africa will push forward dialog in multiple societies, both German and Ghanian, that goes beyond art and political interests. This is the reason why Philip has made the decision to turn to crowdfunding to finance a portion of this project - because it is a matter for all of society, on an international level, and it will help to cultivate social awareness and dialogue by bringing a light to this blind spot of German history.

BLACK WORLD, 1998
In this series i took portraits of people linving in the village my father grew up, Jini Jini in Ghana. This work was a crucial piece in my way exploring the gaps and connections between the two countries and cultures- Germany and Ghana.

There are many school around the country that hold classes based on Special Effect Makeup. I may need to pay for airfare, lodging and rental cars to make this happen. I will need to take time of, therefore I will not be able to bring in as much money to help support my family. The classes are not inexpensive.</p>

<h3>Strokes of Genius is about ""ability"" in contrast to ""disability""!</h3>
<p>My name is Dr. Rosa C. Martinez and I have been working with families and individuals with autism for over 30 years. Strokes of Genius, Inc is a non-profit organization and our mission is to educate and empower individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) by promoting the artistic abilities in contrast to the <strong>dis</strong>abilities. We builds and supports these artistic talents through the provision of educational art studio experiences and workshops to “Train the Talent℠” and further expand opportunities toward inclusion and independence as a vehicle for the individual’s livelihood. We exhibit the artworks produced by these talented individuals and all proceeds go back to the artist.</p>
<ul>
<li>We strive to further expand opportunities for individuals with autism who are impaired socially, verbally, behaviorally and for those with a “love” or “obsession” in creating art by providing a vehicle for them to be able to generate income from their creativity.</li>
<li>Due to the characteristic disabilities of these individuals many may be unemployable and the existing employment opportunities are also extremely limited. In addition, often times a family is overwhelmed with the care-taking of their autistic child, and opportunities to create a livelihood for their talented, yet extremely challenged child are impossible to attain.</li>
<li>Strokes of Genius, Inc. seeks to empower the individual, train the talent and showcase and sell the artists works “by the artist” and “for the artist”. We need your help to provide an appropriate professional art studio environment where such individuals can feel proud to produce their work.  </li>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Alex and I share a passion for art almost as strong as for each other.  We have never been able to buy, let alone commission any art, to support those who create it.  We figure our wedding offers a unique opportunity to do just that. We would like to raise the funds to commission an artist friend of ours, Amanda Cadogan, to paint a portrait of each of us ( two canvases at about 14"" x 18"" each )</p>
<p>While housewares and the like are always appreciated, a painting transcends the everyday. Tehy will never wear out, break, or become outdated. They will grow in value over time for us as a moment of our youth captured forever, and hopefully will be something we can pass down. We know it's a little unusual, but we have never been too concerned with being normal in the first place.</p>
<h3>About the Artist:</h3>
<p>Amanda Cadogan has a longstanding interest in the classical realist tradition. At the age of thirteen, she began her formal art training in the studio of portraitists <a href=""http://pulidostudio.blogspot.com/search/label/About%20Numael%20Pulido"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Numael and Shirley Pulido</a> of Hancock, New Hampshire, who teach a classical technique derived from their study of the Old Masters. Amanda took classes from the Pulidos for nine years, concluding her training with a class trip to Florence, and went on to study painting, art history, and English at Sarah Lawrence College. Her interest in Early Modern theories of imitation and beauty in both poetry and painting led her to receive a Master of Arts in the Humanities from the University of Chicago. Amanda currently lives in Oakland where she works in higher education, paints, and teaches private art lessons. Her portraits and still lifes are represented in several private collections across the United States.</p>
<p>We don't know many other painters that are able to capture the same spirit of a person (the vibe, or timbre, if you will) as Amanda; she is a truly talented artist and an all around wonderful, creative person. You can see samples of her work here: <a href=""https://amandacadogan.wordpress.com/portfolio/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://amandacadogan.wordpress.com/portfolio/</a></p>
<h3>Process</h3>
<p>Lyndsey's sister Gabrielle will take portraits of us digitally according to Amanda's guidelines and then send them off to be transformed into oil and canvas. It could take some time, but over the coming months we will have a sketch and then the final painted portraits some time before our one year anniversary. We will frame them with notes from contributors in the back, and cherish them over the years to come!</p>

<p>By now, I stamped over 1 000 000 square feet of  art with  with a technology that allows humans to walk and live on art or dreamy complex designs that never existed. </p>
<p>I strongly believe that people are ready for a colorful world, an innovative revolution in design, where live work play and create,  where the floor literally takes you away, refreshens your mind and stimulates your creativity and ability to think outside of the box.</p>
<p><b>The campaign ...</b></p>
<p>I painted floors for a lot of clients and it's time to paint floors for the whole world to  enjoy ! This campaign is all about offering the opportunity to the world to experience what it's like to walk into a space where the space is altered beyond conformity , where  the floor is painted like ... water, lava, a large diamond, an infinite geometry, an abstract jewel , a bed of roses or anything you can imagine ! The goal is to design and open up 3 studios 3 floors, allowing people to enter a new dimension a fourth dimension opened up beneath your feet by the simple floor, the big elephant in the room. After all you will spend most of your life in constant contact with it why not tap into it for creative stimulation, you will be surprised what happens to you and the people around .  </p>
<p>People will be able to access the space for public and private events, for shows, launches, presentations,  as well as live paint performances by the Powerland troupe.</p>
<p><b>The power of your contribution ...</b></p>
<p>Your investment will help beautify the ground, the surface that connects us all. Contributing to this project will bring a bit of dreamworld into our real world.

<p>Welcome to Larkin Arts!  We are a husband and wife team, Scott L. Whitten and Valerie L. Smith combined with local artist and curator extraordinaire, Lynda Bostrom, to bring a much needed art center to a growing community.  </p>
<p>A LITTLE ABOUT US: â€¨</p>
<p><strong>Scott </strong>is a local musician and bartender with deep ties to our community and a love for the arts. He also happens to make the best greeting cards ever.</p>
<p><strong>Valerie</strong> is an art teacher with 12 years experience teaching elementary and middle school. She is the program coordinator for summer youth art education at a local university and she was just named to the board of our local arts council.â€¨â€¨ </p>
<p><strong>Lynda</strong> is a transplant from Sarasota, FL and, let’s face it, Harrisonburg hasn’t been the same since! Lynda is an incredibly talented full-time artist with a work ethic like no other. She has inspired Harrisonburg artists to rise up and CREATE. Her experience as the coordinator of 4 galleries at an art center in FL has helped in her mission to create more art venues in our downtown.</p>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Our goal with Indiegogo is to raise the funds to complete our art center, located right smack dab in the middle of our town in an old furniture warehouse. Your immediate support will have a lasting impact on our incredible and deserving community.</span></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>A LITTLE ABOUT OUR CENTER:<br/>â€¨Larkin Arts will have 4 main components.</p>
<p><strong>-School-</strong> With 3 classrooms, we’ll offer year round quality art education classes for all ages and levels taught by certified educators or highly skilled professional artists.</p>
<p><strong>-Gallery-</strong> With only two other dedicated fine arts spaces in our city, our two room gallery will fill a void, highlighting local, national and international artists.</p>
<p><strong>-Supply-</strong> As the only fine art supply store within a large swath of the Shenandoah Valley, we will serve a very personal and tactile need of our artist community.</p>
<p><strong>-Studios- </strong>Our space will include five, 24-hour-access studios for artists to create daily. The public will be able to see creativity in action!â€¨â€¨</p>
<p>We have been working on this project for over a year and are ready to open in August. In fact, the demolition of our space (by local geniuses Sustainable Solutions) has already begun and the brochure for our August classes is out! Our city and a neighboring city have loaned us funds, as well as a local bank and some quite wonderful local patrons. But, we do need additional assistance in this last push to get our doors open. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We need your help!</strong></p>
<p><strong>We need $25,000 for educational supplies and a good-ole bathroom!</strong></p>
<p>We want to make our school a place of inspiration and we want our students to have the tools they need to make their goals a reality. We have three classrooms and want to outfit them with whiteboards, projectors and a laptop. We need cabinetry, tables, easels and drying racks. We are building a kiln room and need to purchase our Skutt kiln, ventilation duct and shelving. And most importantly, we need supplies! We want to stock our shelves with tools for drawing, painting, sculpting, printmaking, ceramics, collage, etc. Non-consumable supplies and equipment last for years and years and sometimes forever. Helping us to stock these items will have a lasting impact on our business and, in turn, our community.</p>
<p>Oh yeah- and we need a bathroom! Our commercial space has access to bathrooms in a shared hallway, but we would like to have a little one inside our Larkin Arts walls for our kiddos and our studio artists.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>And besides the overwhelming feeling of satisfaction you get from helping a local, female-owned business create 3 new jobs and become a rich resource for an extended community, YOU GET STUFF, TOO!</strong></p>
<p>Check out our perks and enjoy a little of us giving back to you for helping our dream become a reality.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>So, what can you do?</strong></p>
<p>It’s super easy! The number one thing you can do with this campaign is <strong>SHARE </strong>IT. Use the Indiegogo share tools to pass this right along to everyone you know! Let’s make some noise and let everyone know Larkin Arts is coming and is so excited to be here as a resource for each and every one of you.</p>
<p>If you are able and inclined, please <strong>DONATE</strong>! It is easy and safe- we have done it for other campaigns. Best part? You will go to bed tonight feeling great that you have directly supported a local business to get on their feet, create 3 new jobs in this economy, and be a rich resource for the Shenandoah Valley.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.diystudio.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">DIY Studio</a> will be the first non-profit Creative Reuse Center in Marion County. A creative reuse center is where materials are diverted from the solid waste stream and then are collected, sorted, and sold to be repurposed into creative projects for the public, schools, and non-profits. The possiblities are endless! We will provide materials for collage, painting, sculpting, upcycled crafts, sewing, knitting, paper crafts and much, much more!</p>
<p>Supporting DIY Studio, is investing in a sustainable Salem. Not only will tons of materials be diverted from the solid waste stream, but through the sale of those materials, we’ll provide art education as well as Do It Yourself (DIY) classes to our community. We’ll put people to work in green collar jobs and offer volunteers opportunities to learn new skills. It’s a win-win for our city!</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are asking for your help to raise funds for start up costs, six months of rent, and utilities to open DIY Studio. Without six months of rent and utilities DIY Studio won't open its doors. Do not fear, we will not rest until we have a creative reuse center in Salem! If we don't fund completely though Indiegogo we will dry our tears and keep offering Community Craft Nights, promoting and educating about DIY Studio in the community, and raising funds.</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>If you give to this project we guarantee that your heart will grow three sizes larger, AND we will show our appreciation of your generosity by offering one-of-a-kind perks. DIY Studio is a grassroots movement and we need and value your support!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your gift to DIY Studio will make our work possible. Here are some examples of what your dollars will support.</p>
<ul>

<h2>THANK YOU!</h2></span></div>","DIY Studio
DIY Studio will be the first non-profit Creative Reuse Center in Marion County. A creative reuse center is where materials are diverted from the solid waste stream and then are collected, sorted, and sold to be repurposed into creative projects for the public, schools, and non-profits. The possiblities are endless! We will provide materials for collage, painting, sculpting, upcycled crafts, sewing, knitting, paper crafts and much, much more!
Supporting DIY Studio, is investing in a sustainable Salem. Not only will tons of materials be diverted from the solid waste stream, but through the sale of those materials, we’ll provide art education as well as Do It Yourself (DIY) classes to our community. We’ll put people to work in green collar jobs and offer volunteers opportunities to learn new skills. It’s a win-win for our city!
What We Need
We are asking for your help to raise funds for start up costs, six months of rent, and utilities to open DIY Studio. Without six months of rent and utilities DIY Studio won't open its doors. Do not fear, we will not rest until we have a creative reuse center in Salem! If we don't fund completely though Indiegogo we will dry our tears and keep offering Community Craft Nights, promoting and educating about DIY Studio in the community, and raising funds.
What You Get
If you give to this project we guarantee that your heart will grow three sizes larger, AND we will show our appreciation of your generosity by offering one-of-a-kind perks. DIY Studio is a grassroots movement and we need and value your support!
The Impact
Your gift to DIY Studio will make our work possible. Here are some examples of what your dollars will support.

$3,000 will cover the cost of one month of rent.

$850 will cover the cost of filing with the IRS. Done!
$650 will cover the cost of one month of utilities.
$250 will provide free use of the facility to a non-profit organization.
$100 will provide free materials to a school or artist that cannot otherwise afford them.
$50 will underwrite the cost of a class.

$50 will cover the cost of filing with the state. Done!
$25 will underwrite the cost of fliers that tell the world about DIY Studio.
$10 will underwrite the cost of a craft kit for a child in need.

Every dollar makes a difference!

<h3>Arctic Alaska</h3>
<p>I’m Rick Saez, a freelance photographer from the Bay Area in California.  This project is to publish a fine art photo book documenting the beauty and grandeur of the Utukok Uplands in Arctic Alaska.  I am asking for your help in funding some of the production costs of the book.</p>
<p>No matter which side of the issue you’re on, <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">protect the environment </span>or<span style=""text-decoration: underline;""> drill baby drill</span>, I’m confident many of you are aware of the battle in Arctic Alaska between the Environment and Big Oil.  Unfortunately many of us rarely, if ever get the opportunity to visit Arctic Alaska.  Time, money and life often get in the way.  In my experience as a photographer seeing a place visually provides a terrific perspective of the land.  My project is designed to provide that perspective, capturing the spectacular landscape of the Utukok Uplands.  In return for your support you’ll have the opportunity to own a “limited edition” print from the collection, and receive a signed copy of the book.</p>

<h3>Your Support</h3>
<p>The goal of $5,000 is to cover some of the publishing and production costs for the book.  I am going to the Arctic regardless of the fate of this project.  I plan to capture amazing images, produce the book and would love your support and participation in the journey. </p>
<h3>Rewards</h3>
<p>I will process the images after the trip and begin producing the book.  A selection of the best images will be posted on my web site in a private gallery and a password sent to you.  In this gallery you will be able to choose your image/print at your convenience.  Your print will be printed and sent to you immediately.  My goal is to have the gallery up and all images edited no later than July 15, 2013.  The book will take a bit longer with the goal to have the book available for purchase by September 15, 2013. </p>
<p><strong>Limited Edition Prints</strong>- I will only offer 200 of each of these images.  Your print number will be determined by when you signed on to support the project. </p>
<p>Each Limited Edition 8”x10”, 10”x10”, 11” x 14” and 16”x20” print will be professionally printed on Kodak ENDURA professional photo paper with a glossy finish and mounted on 2mm styrene for durability.</p>
<p><strong>The Book</strong>-  A 12” x 12” Hardcover book professionally printed on Proline Pearl Photo paper with a slightly glossy finish.  I’m targeting 40-50 pages and anticipate the retail price to be around $125.</p>

<h3>The Land</h3>
<p>Arctic Treks describes the land as follows: “The Western Arctic, incongruously named ""Natl. Petroleum Reserve-Alaska"" (NPRA) encompasses the largest single unit of public land in our nation.  This 23 million acre road less tract of land in the Western Arctic, lying between the Brooks Range and the Arctic Ocean, is one of the wildest and most remote areas on the continent. Designated as a speculative ""petroleum reserve"" in 1923, and containing rich deposits of natural gas, coal and hard rock minerals, this vast wilderness is also the summer home of millions of migrating waterfowl and shorebirds, and the 450,000 caribou of the Western Arctic herd.</p>
<p>The Utukok Uplands, north of the far western Brooks Range, is a vast expanse of rolling tundra foothills, plateaus and mesas, with uninhibited views to every horizon. It's also the calving grounds for the Western Arctic caribou herd. I'll be floating a segment of the upper Utukok River as it cuts through the Utukok Uplands, exploring enticing ridges on day hikes, as well as paddling a river run by only handfuls of people. The location and timing of this trip is designed to encounter huge numbers of caribou as they move through the river valleys after calving, along with the grizzlies, wolves, foxes and wolverines that often follow the herd.</p>

<p><i>Past experiences:</i></p>
</div><div> <p>I already traveled twice to expand my art experience.

<p>I traveled again recently for the <b>Barcelona International Art Fair </b>in December of 2014. My eyes were open to the immense variety of artists and their work, among them of course the masters Pablo Picasso's Museum, Dali's house-museum, and Antonio Gaudi's La Sagrada Familia.</p>
<p>I have more chances to travel for Art Residencies in the near future but it can take a toll on a starving artist's wallet. With your help, those dreams to see more can be achieved.</p>
<p>If for any reason you cannot donate your money, please spread the word as much as you can to your friends, colleagues or art lovers that you know.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance, even if just for showing interest in this project. I cannot thank you enough already.</p>
</div></div>","My name is Gee elShaikh and as an emerging artist, traveling for art residencies to meet new artists and gain experience would be a major contribution to my ever-growing passion!

My next destination is HAIHATUS AIR (Artist In Residence) in Joutsa, Finland where I will research and discover the local mythology, ancient and new, and compare and contrast with Egyptian mythology to create dialogue between both cities. This will result in printed illustrations of fascinating beasts to tell stories of history.
Unfortunately over the years, art funds have been more and more difficult to apply to due to the high competition of amazing colleagues. So what better way to have friends, family, and pure fans to help me out! 



 More details:
The funding will cover my expenses in Jousta, Finland for the month of June, which will cost $850 USD per month (including accommodation, food, basic purchases) travel expenses which will cost approx. $650 USD for a roundtrip (this will include transportation from Helsinki to Joutsa) along with the art materials and other expenses I will have to buy to create the artwork there $500 USD.
The total amounts to approx. $2,000.

<h3>SUPER NOVA 2013</h3>
<p>My name is Christopher Griffin from Ottawa, Canada and I have been an artist for 23 years. In 2012, I exhibited 'Planet Elephants' for Nuit Blanche in Ottawa. Nuit Blanche is a one night a year, dusk till dawn celebration of contemporary art. My installation consisted of a herd of 17 concrete elephants. I then invited the public to create their own small elephant out of clay and either add it to the herd or hide it throughout the City. 1700 elephants were created and people were discovering elephants all over the City for weeks after the event. The overwhelming success of this project has inspired me to create an exhibit once again for Nuit Blanche 2013.</p>
<p>The theme for  Nuit Blanche on September 21, 2013 is 'Supernova'. SUPER NOVA! Immediately, what came to mind was the Chevy Nova: the car my friends urged me to buy when I was a teenager. So, my concept is to create a Detroit style Auto Show complete with red carpets, bright lights, a dj, velvet standards and tents. A collection of beautiful, classic Chevy Novas will be displayed on either side of my '66 Chevy Nova - yes, I've finally purchased a Chevy Nova - except that mine has no engine, no transmission, no rolling wheels, hood, seats or windshield! This car will begin the evening under drapery which will be dramatically unveiled to reveal my junkyard special. The challenge will be to the public to make this the most SUPER of SUPER NOVAs! Each person will be given a small amount of clay to apply to this car in any manner they see fit. The end product is not the goal - though I have no doubt people will create a fantastic sculpture. The success of this project will be evident in the intent and interaction of the public in covering a car in clay. A SUPER NOVA for a car crazy culture.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am looking for $12 000 to host a Detroit style Auto Show: rental and set up of 90' of tenting, red carpets, professional lighting and spotlights, velvet standards and fencing, a generator, professional sound system and dj. Enough clay to cover a full sized car. Security detail from dusk till dawn, stop action camera, video cameras, design services for website, facebook, youtube, twitter accounts. Purchase of a 1966 Chevy Nova, towing services from Renfrew, welding together doors, hood, wheels for display purposes only. Incentives for classic Chevy Nova owners to participate and showcase their beautiful cars.</p>
<p>In return, I will be offering unique perks in the form of original artwork! Drawings, sculpture, paintings, each one of a kind and each hand signed. The Super Nova itself will be offered as a perk!</p>
