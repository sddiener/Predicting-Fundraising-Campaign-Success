<h4>IT'S ELECTRIC</h4>
<p>We don't want to get technical, but this is a jewel. A powerful 250 watt motor will help you climb steep hills and easily and cruise along with less effort. </p>
<p>Once you start to pedal, you feel an amazing force help you move forward, the motor kicks in you go faster and farther without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>The electric system is design under US/EU regulations.  This bike is defined as a ""pedalec"" which means that it assists while pedaling (there is no throttle) and max speed for the electric motor is restricted to 15.5 mph or 25km/h.</p>

<h4>IT'S LIGHT AND FOLDS FAST</h4>
<p>Coming in at only 26 lbs.(12Kg) the CMYK 4.0 is very easy to transport. The handlebars fold down in one motion and the seat easily lowers making the bike a compact package to take on the train, put in your car or stash under your desk.<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> </span></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fplayer.vimeo.com%2Fvideo%2F134521470&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F134521470&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.vimeocdn.com%2Fvideo%2F528057717_1280.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=vimeo"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>

<h4>BUILT-IN PHONE CHARGER</h4>
<p>All of these great features take a toll on your phone battery. That is why we put a phone charger directly on the handlebar, so you can power your phone even if the bike runs out of juice.</p>

<h4><b>KNOW THE ROAD AHEAD: CROWD MAPPING </b></h4>
<p>The bike's sensors can determine the condition of the road while you ride. After the ride, the app prompts the rider to answer a few questions about the condition of the road traveled. The more people riding, the more information is collected to generate a map of best routes based on road conditions. This can help you decide which way to take to avoid potholes, cobblestone roads etc... </p>

<p>We’ve come to Indiegogo to share our idea with you and the awesome community of bikers and bike commuters around the world. We want to learn from you, and with your support, we will get this product to market that much faster. </p>
<p>Our design for the bike is almost ready for tooling and mass production, and the app is in development, but only your help will get us to the finish line. We have 15 years experience in developing and manufacturing products, and we have partnered with manufacturers that are experienced in the bicycle industry. Together, we can make this happen.</p>

<p><b>Manufacturing and Industrial Production:</b></p>
<p>Indiegogo projects are a risky undertaking and the reality is that they have the potential to encounter problems in the phases after funding. </p>
<p>We greatly appreciate the vote of confidence and trust our backers have put in us and in our project. We are working hard to avoid issues and have been planning a contingency strategy to get the products to the backers and fulfill our goal of getting more people riding bikes.</p>
<p>Our combined experience and a network of resources in the US and overseas will allow us to quickly react to eventual issues. More importantly, we are doing our homework beforehand so that we do not run into unexpected problems.</p>
<p>In the last 18 months, we have been working diligently on fine-tuning the design, testing and making adjustments in order to have an end result that is the best possible biking experience that is free of “bugs” and does things that people never imagined.</p>
<p><span>We have more than 15 years experience designing and manufacturing. We also have partners in China and Taiwan for manufacturing. Our design is finalized and we have partnered with the best bike manufacturers to make sure we have things in place once we go to full production. We've also already spent a few months collaborating with factories and suppliers during the prototyping phase.</span></p>

</div></div>","Big Thanks for your support and Contributions!
The CMYK 4.0 is InDemand and still available. We look forward to delivering this awesome bike and will have an update next week.
     THE BEST BIKE COMMUTING EXPERIENCE   Bike to work. No sweat.A 250 watt motor will give you 30 miles of assisted riding with one charge. Regulate your cadence and heart rate with the mobile app.Connect with public transportation.Coordinate transit connections with mass transit schedules. The quick-fold mechanism makes this lightweight bike easy to bring on board.Know the road ahead.Information generated through crowd mapping provides current information on road conditions. Avoid bumpy roads, construction and accidents.     
 
 


 


IT'S ELECTRIC
We don't want to get technical, but this is a jewel. A powerful 250 watt motor will help you climb steep hills and easily and cruise along with less effort. 
Once you start to pedal, you feel an amazing force help you move forward, the motor kicks in you go faster and farther without breaking a sweat.
The electric system is design under US/EU regulations.  This bike is defined as a ""pedalec"" which means that it assists while pedaling (there is no throttle) and max speed for the electric motor is restricted to 15.5 mph or 25km/h.
  
IT'S LIGHT AND FOLDS FAST
Coming in at only 26 lbs.(12Kg) the CMYK 4.0 is very easy to transport. The handlebars fold down in one motion and the seat easily lowers making the bike a compact package to take on the train, put in your car or stash under your desk. 

BUILT-IN PHONE CHARGER
All of these great features take a toll on your phone battery. That is why we put a phone charger directly on the handlebar, so you can power your phone even if the bike runs out of juice.




 
ENHANCE YOUR COMMUTING EXPERIENCEThe mobile app is how you interact directly with the bike and the context in which you travel.  
It tells you info like speed, cadence, distance, step-by-step navigation, performance and all sorts of stats on your riding.
You can also access train/bus schedules, step by step navigation and even know road conditions ahead and get warnings of potential danger zones.

 

EASILY FIND ALL BIKE PATHS NEAR YOU
The app tells you where bike lanes are located so that you can plan which routes to take ahead of time.
 


KNOW THE ROAD AHEAD: CROWD MAPPING 
The bike's sensors can determine the condition of the road while you ride. After the ride, the app prompts the rider to answer a few questions about the condition of the road traveled. The more people riding, the more information is collected to generate a map of best routes based on road conditions. This can help you decide which way to take to avoid potholes, cobblestone roads etc... 


USE YOUR BIKE + PUBLIC TRANSIT 
 
The bike knows all of the train, bus and subway stops and can guide you there. It also gives you schedules so that you can plan your trip with precision. 


RECEIVE ROAD HAZARD WARNINGS
 
Know the dangerous or hazardous streets in your city. With information available from police reports and other sources, the mobile app alerts you of dangerous intersections and areas to avoid.



LOCK YOUR BIKE FROM YOUR PHONEThe electronic lock feature allows you to lock/unlock the electronics of the bike from your phone. If your bike is armed and it is moved an alarm will sound.  We still recommend using a U-lock or similar. (See below: The basket accessory has a place for the lock, its pretty neat)



 
 
 
 
A BASKET THAT MAKES SENSE


 
The basket has two velcro straps that allow you to attach it to the bike. Made of a soft but sturdy material, you can also put your phone (any size) in the dedicated pocket with window. This allows you interact with the phone and view your route and stats while riding. (Available as an accessory)
 

 
COVER YOUR BIKE
 
The storage bag is a compact package that opens up to cover and protect your bike while traveling or when you store it. This is an important courtesy if you bring your bike on the bus or subway. (Available as an accessory)

 

EVERYONE CAN SEE YOU WITH THIS SAFETY LIGHT
 
Laser beams project a virtual bike lane on the road around the bike. Also a steady or blinking light keeps you visible and makes riding safer at night. (Available as an accessory)


ACCESS YOUR DATA ANYTIME ANYWHERE


Although you have this data on your mobile app, it may be more comfortable to look at on a larger screen.
Once you've arrived home or at your office you can dig deep into all of the statistics of your trips: duration, average speed, cadence over speed, routes you've taken, etc. 
You can also track your performance like; calories burned, average heart rate, and peaks and lows so you can target which areas of your daily commute to speed up.
The bike can be managed from the app, where you can see the battery rate of discharge, charging time and how battery consumption changes along the road. You can also plan your commute and socialize with other riders to organize a group ride or get tips on how to improve your daily commute.

THE TECHNOLOGY

 





 

We have been working for more than 5 years developing the CMYK. There were 3 previous versions and we have made improvements based on feedback we've received from previous customers. We are now getting ready for production and developing the app. 
 
 
 Next steps are for manufacturing and fulfillment and have partners ready to go. However, we know that before mass production begins, we may encounter a few bumps in the road. We have plans to mitigate all the risks and have enlisted a group of great advisors that will help. 
 
 





 
We’ve come to Indiegogo to share our idea with you and the awesome community of bikers and bike commuters around the world. We want to learn from you, and with your support, we will get this product to market that much faster. 
Our design for the bike is almost ready for tooling and mass production, and the app is in development, but only your help will get us to the finish line. We have 15 years experience in developing and manufacturing products, and we have partnered with manufacturers that are experienced in the bicycle industry. Together, we can make this happen.
 



Manufacturing and Industrial Production:
Indiegogo projects are a risky undertaking and the reality is that they have the potential to encounter problems in the phases after funding. 
We greatly appreciate the vote of confidence and trust our backers have put in us and in our project. We are working hard to avoid issues and have been planning a contingency strategy to get the products to the backers and fulfill our goal of getting more people riding bikes.
Our combined experience and a network of resources in the US and overseas will allow us to quickly react to eventual issues. More importantly, we are doing our homework beforehand so that we do not run into unexpected problems.
In the last 18 months, we have been working diligently on fine-tuning the design, testing and making adjustments in order to have an end result that is the best possible biking experience that is free of “bugs” and does things that people never imagined.
We have more than 15 years experience designing and manufacturing. We also have partners in China and Taiwan for manufacturing. Our design is finalized and we have partnered with the best bike manufacturers to make sure we have things in place once we go to full production. We've also already spent a few months collaborating with factories and suppliers during the prototyping phase.
Software:
The software and app are in development and we are working to build all the features that we want to include in the Brooklyness app. Software development sometimes takes longer than expected, but our team is experienced in this area and we are ready to identify external help should the need arise. 
Even though we are thinking ahead and preparing for the worst, some things may escape our control. We want to rely on our backers for support and patience if we run into difficulties, and we promise we will not stop until the project is completed!

<h3>COVID Has Been Hard</h3>
<p>I had to close down my motorcycle fast charging company and portable home DCFC charger company due to complications with vendor timing and international shipping due to COVID. I almost lost everything including my house because of this. After lots of meditation and praying, an Idea came to me.<br/><br/>I had an appointment with a spine Dr. because I crushed my spine in a motorcycle accident, but I had a bent pin in my leaf's J1772 port and the leaf was at 3% SoC so I could not make it to the nearest ChaDeMo station. My wife spoke with the dealer who said it would cost $2,000 USD to fix. When she told me this, I calmly said, OK, I will fix it. In my head though, I said ""F*** that, I'll fix it myself and make it better, those rip off bastards..."" <br/><br/>I came up with this idea and prototyped it in my garage. I am already charging at over 6-7kW, the fastest I had ever seen before was 5.1kW from a single J1772 station. I will be porting all of the work I did on my highly compact, high density, motorcycle weather-resistant chargers to allow all of the following.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tesla compatibility</li>
<li>Single, double, or triple J1772 station use in the USA and other areas</li>
<li>3 phase menekes support for EU and other areas</li>
<li>L2 charging speeds upto 19.8kW </li>
<li>Install documentation for dealers or experienced DIY hackers </li>
</ul>
<p>I have never been a fan of slow charging, and if you like waiting to charge or twiddling your thumbs this might not be right for you. But if you think slow charging is stupid, like I do, welcome to the future of not being in club slow charge. And remember friend's don't let friends slow charge, so share this with your group of smart friends. </p>

<p>My name is Tim Newman, I am the CEO of Brakers Early Warning Systems Inc. I have been running this business for about 3 years now and I am finally at the stage where I can say I will have my product out and fully operational within the next year.</p>
<p>My product is called <strong>B.R.A.K.E.R.S.</strong> It stand for Broadcasting to Radios Ahead Keeps Emergency Respnders Safe.</p>
<p>I was nearly in a three way collision with an ambulance and a pick-up truck when I pulled over to allow the ambulance to pass and the truck came from behind me and cut off the ambulance. It was a near miss to be sure and this is why I want to provide my product to the masses. I want to ensure that all drivers can be informed from inside their car so that they don't make the mistake of not knowing why I pulled over and stopped (lets give the guy the benefit of the doubt).</p>
<p>My product will interupt any function of the radio even if it is off, allowing the customized message to come through your speakers and then the radiio will go back to what it was doing before.</p>
<p>If I am able to reach the goal of this campaign I will not only be able to finish off the software design, but I will also be able to start producing the first retail ready pieces.</p>

<p>This work will include the software as mentioned before. The software will include server software and applications for both IOS and Android operating systems. These applications will allow you to have a receiver inside your car using the smart phone you already have. It will know when you are in your car so don't worry you won't be getting messages while in a meeting, on a date or sitting at the dinner table.</p>
<p>The advantage for a motorist is to not be surprised by flashing lights right behind them.</p>
<p>The advantage for a police officer is to be able to proceed through traffic without delay and as safely as possible.</p>
<p>The advantage for the general public is that the responders can get to them as quickly and safely as possible to administer aid. You may have enough respect to pull out of the way, but I ask you have you ever seen someone who did not show that same respect and cause an emergency vehicle to be delayed?</p>
<p>The transmitter will be sold to police, fire and other emergency departments so that they can broadcast the messages that you would receive.</p>
<p><strong>The remainder of the money raised will allow me to have 200 units built and ready to ship.</strong></p>
<p>I think it is safe to say that anyone reading this will know someone in at least one of the emergency responder fields (police, fire or ambulance). Before you pledge any cash please give them a call a and ask them this question. "" IS IT A REAL PROBLEM THAT PEOPLE DON'T MOVE OUT OF YOUR WAY EVEN THOUGH YOUR LIGHTS AND SIRENS ARE GOING""?</p>
<p>I would then encourage you to let them know about this campaign and I hope that not only would you return, but they would also come and have a look.</p>
<p>Even if my goal is not reached I will finish the software design, build as many units as I have money for and find another way to get the rest of the units built, as I said I have been working on this for the last three years and I am not about to stop now especially when I am so close.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This project I believe will not only make it easier for the responders to get to the call, but I believe it will save many lives each year. In the USA there are nearly 70 officers killed each year due to traffic accidents or by being hit while doing a traffic stop on the roadside. This product will inform drivers that they are present and what is expected of them. 
</p>
<p>It will also have other impacts on society such as Amber Alerts, it will also inform you of sever weather like tornados ETC...</p>
<p>When there are so many things that take a motorists mind off driving it will be nice to know that in these emergency situations something will be there to ensure they are kept aware at that moment.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Even if you can not contribute, but you see the value of this product and its intention of saving lives I would ask that you use the share tools available on this campaign and share it with people you know. The more people made aware of this campagn, the better the chance will be that you can download the application next summer.</p>
<p>Thank you for looking at my campaign, I hope with your help it will be a success. BTW please visit my website for more information.</p>

If you share my desire to aid these emergency workers any way that we can, do I have a product for you.

 

My name is Tim Newman, I am the CEO of Brakers Early Warning Systems Inc. I have been running this business for about 3 years now and I am finally at the stage where I can say I will have my product out and fully operational within the next year.
My product is called B.R.A.K.E.R.S. It stand for Broadcasting to Radios Ahead Keeps Emergency Respnders Safe.
I was nearly in a three way collision with an ambulance and a pick-up truck when I pulled over to allow the ambulance to pass and the truck came from behind me and cut off the ambulance. It was a near miss to be sure and this is why I want to provide my product to the masses. I want to ensure that all drivers can be informed from inside their car so that they don't make the mistake of not knowing why I pulled over and stopped (lets give the guy the benefit of the doubt).
My product will interupt any function of the radio even if it is off, allowing the customized message to come through your speakers and then the radiio will go back to what it was doing before.
If I am able to reach the goal of this campaign I will not only be able to finish off the software design, but I will also be able to start producing the first retail ready pieces.

Shines bright red to indicate the deceleration of a motorcycle driver.Easily snaps on any helmet.Mimicking the brake light of a car, Cosmo shines bright red when riders decelerate.When you decelerate, Cosmo lights up red, warning anyone behind you that you are coming to a stop or you are slowing down. This allows riders to be more visible in all weather conditions.  The Cosmo flashes red in warning mode, notifying those on the road that you are there.If your bike breaks down or you are stuck in traffic, you can set the Cosmo to ""warning mode"" via the smartphone application.If you happen to fall or get into an accident and your helmet hits the ground, Cosmo automatically starts blinking red, notifying drivers that you are on the ground and you need help.Accurate sensors detect the speed and deceleration of the rider.The deceleration of the rider is known via the accelerometer of the product. The light goes on upon deceleration, even if the rider does not press the brake of the vehicle (by releasing the accelerator or by retrograde).The gyrometer detects the rate of change of angles undergone by the helmet around 3 axes. The electronic signatures of these movements, coupled with those of the accelerometer, make it possible to detect a fall.BLE technology allows for quick communication with your smartphone.Cosmo communicates with the biker's smartphone in Bluetooth® Low Energy to maximize the autonomy of the Cosmo Connected product and the biker's smartphone.Cosmo is equipped with a 900mAh Lithium Ion rechargeable battery.The battery offers an autonomy of 5h to 8h of continuous use and 5 to 7 days of standby. Cosmo can be charged using the supplied micro-USB cable, approximately once a week, depending on the intended use. An app built to increase user personal safety and save lives.The Cosmo app is packed with features that decrease the time it takes to call emergency responders and notify loved ones of an accident.Automatically notify emergency responders and contacts.Preprogram your medical history into the app so that emergency responders know exactly what to expect when they arrive. Also your emergency contacts will be notified of the accident via text message.Cosmo automatically detects accidents and takes action. If the device detects the driver’s fall, it will warn the app through the Bluetooth® connection and automatically alert an emergency roadside assistance platform that will try to reach the driver. If the driver is unresponsive, the operator will call rescue within 3 minutes and sends first responders the GPS coordinates, along with the medical profile of the driver.Magnetic snap secure design makes connecting Cosmo quick and easy.We worked with the best designers and engineers to create an efficient, easy to use, reliable product that works in all weather conditions when it is most important. With Cosmo Connected, you’ll be seen on the road despite rain, fog, or snow.Swap Cosmo between helmets with the magnetic base.The magnetic base is positioned on the back of the helmet with a pre-installed double-sided adhesive. Simply place the double-sided adhesive to your helmet, let it sit for 8 hours to guarantee strong adhesion, clip and unclip your Cosmo as needed for charging or easy storing. Magnetic Helmet Bases (Adhesive Included)Cosmo is designed to detach from your helmet in the case of a crash to maintain the structural integrity of your helmet for utmost protection. We worked with the best designers and engineers to create an efficient, easy to use, reliable product that works in all weather conditions. We also work to develop new products to become a specialist in personal and professional safety via a range of connected devices & applications.New applications of its technology on other vehicles and for other uses will soon be unveiled by Cosmo Connected. The safety accessory developed by Cosmo Connected, can be used in a variety of different situations: biking, skiing, horseback riding, extreme sports...as well as in the professional world where dangerous situations are commonplace (construction, policing, the handling of heavy equipment, deliveries, etc.)

<p>Introducing the CARVON EXO. With the EXO, we have put our knowledge and experience into producing an Electric Longboard that rides better and last longer even on bad city roads. It's the perfect commuter board and with a price that everyone can agree on. We put our innovative V4 TorqueDrive motors on a drop-through deck that is reinforced with a stiff composite layer on the bottom. This results in a board that is comfortable to ride but stiff enough to not bend the electrical connections. We also chose a system where you can easily swap battery packs, so the range is only limited by the extra packs that you carry. The EXO turns the concept of internal and unaccessible components inside out, putting the components externally...hence the name ""EXO"".</p>

<p>The CARVON EXO, along with the CARVON EVO, are the only two Direct-Drive (1:1 gear ratio) Electric Skateboards/Longboards that uses real ABEC 11 Flywheels (optional upgrade). Other Direct-Drive E-boards use blank or clone wheels and their hub/in-wheel motors themselves use only thin urethane. This means that the CARVON EXO, while being affordable, can have premium components and a superb ride-quality comparable to that of more expensive E-boards.

<p>CARVON EXO will have an automatic 7 days free-trial, money-back guarantee upon receiving the board, and customers will <strong>not be charged for any re-stocking fee</strong>.  We just ask that customers pay for the return shipping and return the board without any substantial use. Otherwise, a substantial-use fee will be assessed and deducted from the refund amount, value of which will be at our discretion. Standard industry warranty applies. Additionally, an EXO will have a six month warranty for the electronics (not including the battery life) and one year warranty for the board's hardware. Electronics include the whole motors, ESC, battery pack and remote control. Board's hardware includes the axle, hanger, baseplate, deck, bolts, nuts, screws, spacers and washers. Wear and tear items are not warrantied and include grip tape, wheels, drive-wheel inserts, bearings, bushings and pivot cups.</p>

That's why each EXO will be inspected by a skater, not just someone who only knows electronics. It's time to put back more of the ""Skateboard"" in Electric Skateboards.
 
EXO Warranty and CARVON Customer Support

 
CARVON EXO will have an automatic 7 days free-trial, money-back guarantee upon receiving the board, and customers will not be charged for any re-stocking fee.  We just ask that customers pay for the return shipping and return the board without any substantial use. Otherwise, a substantial-use fee will be assessed and deducted from the refund amount, value of which will be at our discretion. Standard industry warranty applies. Additionally, an EXO will have a six month warranty for the electronics (not including the battery life) and one year warranty for the board's hardware. Electronics include the whole motors, ESC, battery pack and remote control. Board's hardware includes the axle, hanger, baseplate, deck, bolts, nuts, screws, spacers and washers. Wear and tear items are not warrantied and include grip tape, wheels, drive-wheel inserts, bearings, bushings and pivot cups.
 


 
Part of the funds raised will also be used to create a team of customer support specialists that will be available to answer calls during office hours. This team will also setup group rides and CARVON events so that you will have a chance to meet them in person. We definitely want to be out there riding with you guys and getting feedback from your boards. Please support us with your and tell your family and friends about our campaign. You guys are awesome, thank you!",33.0,6,"2 Campaigns

<div style=""text-align: center;"">Storm Sondors is a humble man with much success in his life that not many know about… Storm lives a simple life, enjoys the outdoors, the ocean, traveling but an off the grid in a sense lifestyle. Not much for computers or cell phones…just the great outdoors.</div>
<div>
<p>Storm envisioned the bike after he suffered an accident that temporarily limited his mobility that affected his outdoors/ beach way of life.</p>
<p>Being an avid surfer since he was a child, Storm still finds the time to surf regularly. During the period of his immobility, Storm needed a way to get down to the beach without complicating his injury. As it turns out, Storm’s professional background includes industrial design and lived in Hong Kong for years.</p>
<p>Did you know, many of those little McDonald's toys that you used to get in your Happy Meal were designed and prototyped by Storm for years?</p>
<p>Storm developed the idea of the eBike to get him back to the ocean and into the water by sourcing the needed items to make it for himself through his extensive network of manufacturers in Asia and throughout the world.</p>
<p>With a name like Storm Sondors, it only seemed right to name the bike after him.</p>
<p><b>Where We Plan to go</b></p>
<p>With the amazing outpouring of support over the past few days, we now have the opportunity to do some great things.</p>
<p><b>Charity</b></p>
<p>We would like to align ourselves with a few charities that help people get to and from where they need to go. Do you guys have any ideas of some great ones? Possibly a Veteran’s organization, as we have had many comments about how the eBike could help them out.</p>
<p><b>Demo Day</b></p>
<p>For any of you that live in the Southern California region, we would like to set up a demo day. See the Sondors eBike in action for yourself! Possible locations could be San Diego, Santa Monica and Santa Barbara.</p>
<p>You all had the same questions about the eBike… Have a look below at the most common ones:</p> <h2><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</span></h2>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>MISCELLANEOUS</b></h3>
<p><b>What is the bike in the video?</b></p>
<p>The bike in the video (yellow/ green bike) is the prototype.</p>
<p><b>Why is everybody stand-up riding on the bike in the video?</b></p>
<p>Those are action shots and we wanted to convey how exhilarating the ride is!  Check out TechCrunch's review video for video with someone sitting down on it.</p>
<p><b>You mention Storm’s background is industrial design? What is it?</b></p>
<p>Industrial design is a process of design applied to products that are to be manufactured through techniques of mass production. Its key characteristic is that design is separated from manufacture: the creative act of determining and defining a product's form takes place in advance of the physical act of making a product, which consists purely of repeated, often automated, replication. The role of an industrial designer is to create and execute design solutions for problems of form, usability, physical ergonomics, marketing, brand development, and sales. Industrial designers don't usually design motors, electrical circuits, or gearing that make machines move, but they may affect technical aspects through usability design and form relationships.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>USAGE &amp; ACCESSORIES</b></h3>
<p><b>How is the bike on handling uphill terrain?</b><br/>Performance on hills depends on the steepness of the hill and the weight load on the bike. In some instances, people will need to use both the pedal and the motor to go uphill.</p>
<p><b>What’s the maximum weight limit?</b><br/>We've tested the bike up to 250lbs, we cannot make any guarantees about performance or durability above that weight.</p>
<p><b>How high can the seat extend?</b><br/>The seat can extend a full 12”. This put it 42 inches off the ground.</p>
<p><b>What is the frame size?</b><br/>The frame is 44"" from axle to axle.  78"" tire to tire.</p>
<p><b>How much does the bike weigh?</b></p>
<p>The bike weighs approximately 49lbs without the battery.</p>
<p><b>How much does the battery weigh?</b><br/>The battery weighs approximately 6lbs.</p>
<p><b>What are the battery specifications?</b></p>
<p>36-volt 9ah (approximately) Lithium - Ion battery is designed for long running time. Batteries can be charged hundreds of times without noticeable loss in capacity. Detailed Product Description: 36V 8.8Ah Lithium Ion Bottle E Bike Battery Packs: Specification: Model: Li18650-10S4P Volt: 36V Capacity: 8.8Ah Standard Charge: 1.76A Continuous Charge: 4.4A Max. Continuous Discharge: 8.8A Size: 91*335mm Operating Temp.: -20~+60deg C Including Battery Cells, BMS, Charger and Aluminum Case | Top quality battery, no memory effect, high energy density, long lifecycle. | Electric/Pedal assist range up to 35-50 miles (rider weight and terrain contingent) | Under Electric Power Range - up to 20 miles (rider weight and terrain contingent)</p>
<p><b>Is there a rear-splash guard option? Is there a back-tire rack option?</b> <br/>That option is currently not available through us. This bike has standard frame qualities making it easy to modify with aftermarket products, including splash guards and rear racks.</p>
<p><b>Can I replace the parts on the bike?</b></p>
<p>Sure. We had a few different options for the parts that we decided to move forward with. The decision to select these parts come down to price, availability at scale and quality. It is entirely up to you on what parts you would like to use. Replace them at will.</p>
<p><b>I have seen the wheels on a bike before at my local bike shop, can I buy those if I pop a tire?</b></p>
<p>Absolutely. The Sondors eBike uses parts that are already on existing bikes on the market. The bike parts can be found online, or on other bikes so they are commercially available. This is ultimately what allows us to produce the bike at a lower cost.</p>
<p><b>Is this a single speed bike? Can you limit it to 10MPH for off-roading?</b><br/>We do not currently have any speed limiting options. Pedal power is on a single freewheel gear, as it was designed to receive motor assistance.</p>
<p><b>Is there speed monitoring/digital display on the bike? </b><br/>There is no built-in digital display/speedometer, but the bike will work with any aftermarket speed monitors.</p>
<p><b>Is there a key/interlock to prevent accidental starting?</b> <br/>There is no interlock currently. However the throttle will not start until one presses a button to activate the motor.</p>
<p><b>Will a standard U-Lock fit around the wider frame? </b><br/>This varies depending on the type of lock, and the type of U-Lock that you use, but in general it will work with most consumer bike locks. Remember that the center portion of the frame is utilized for the battery compartment so all frame related locking would be through the back wheel and frame which is ideal in most cases. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>LEGAL/WHERE CAN IT NOT BE USED</b></h3>
<p><b>Can this be used in NYC?</b> <br/>At this current time, there are laws and restrictions on eBikes in NYC and the State of New York. To be safe please check with your local authorities as these types of regulations change frequently.</p>
<p><b>Do you have to wear a helmet?</b></p>
<p>As with any bicycle, safety should be paramount. We would recommend wearing a helmet, even if your state laws does not require it. Sondors eBike is not responsible for injuries, please be safe while you ride.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>PAYMENT &amp; SHIPPING</b></h3>
<p><b>Can it be picked up locally in LA?</b> <br/>At this point in time we are not offering local pick up.</p>
<p><b>How do I pick the color?</b></p>
<p>After the campaign, we’ll reach out to everyone and have you select the color choice.</p>
<p><b>Can it be financed/multiple payments?</b> <br/>We're proud to announce an ""Easy-Pay"" option where for $199 you can reserve your bike now and then pay the remaining balance at the end of the campaign. You can select this option under the <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sondors-electric-bike/contributions/new?perk_amt=199&amp;perk_id=2652489"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Reserve Now, Pay Later""</a> perk.</p>
<p><b>Will the cost of shipping go down?</b> <br/>No. The current cost is $194 for US shipping and $247 for International.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>COST/ MANUFACTURING</b></h3>
<p><b>Why is the price so low for the Sondors eBike compared to competition?</b></p>
<p>Storm Sondors is 100% committed to creating the first affordable eBike. Most options on the market now are far more expensive, limiting the ability for everyday people to have the opportunity to have. He hopes this is the electronic bike for the masses.</p>
<p><b>How can you keep the eBike’s cost so low?</b></p>
<p>This goes back to Storm’s experience. Having had years of experience in sourcing and manufacturing, we can keep cost low based on volume. Keep in mind, all those happy meal toys were designed and prototype to be cost effective by Storm Sondors. That is volume…that experience is how we keep our price low.</p>
<p><b>How is the eBike built?</b></p>
<p>The Sondors eBike is manufactured using all existing parts to keep cost low. Storm has carefully sourced manufacturers throughout the world in order to keep prices low, while ensuring quality.</p>
<p><b>Can Sondors eBike handle the volume of bikes?</b></p>
<p>Yes. The more bikes the better. This will allow us to reduce the overall cost of the bike and the shipping cost directly to you. Our sourcing and manufacturing partners are world class. Storm has been working with them for decades.</p>
<p><b>How many eBikes can you deliver?</b></p>
<p>Storm Sondors is confident that we can deliver between 12,000-14,000 eBikes in a first production run. This is based on our quality control process of testing each bike before it is shipped. Should we have demand for over these numbers, we will likely need to schedule a second production run to accommodate the volume.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>SUPPORT</b></h3>
<p><b>Will replacement parts be available at local shops/manufacturers? </b></p>
<p>Tires can be purchased off-the-shelf. We do not currently have a list of local shops but in the future we will provide a list of parts that are recommended as replacements.</p>
<p><b>Can I get a refund?</b></p>
<p>According to <a href=""https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles/526876-Refunds"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Indiegogo</a>, contributions are non-refundable in their Terms of Use. There will be no refunds as all funds go immediately to<br/>manufacturing.</p>
<p><b>How much will replacement tires/wheels cost?</b> <br/>Replacement wheels retail for between $50 to $80. In the future, we hope to start an online store to fulfill these items for you.</p>
<p><b>Will there be a network of authorized Sondors eBike dealers?</b> <br/>Eventually we hope to have authorized dealers, but we do not currently have a list of local shops. </p>

When you back Swytch we will update you regularly on our progress. We want to offer you the very best for believing in us from the beginning and therefore strive to reach our targets so we can bring more features and products to the market sooner. Here is a breakdown of our stretch goals released so far. See the updates section for more info.




   Our founder, Oliver, has over 6 years experience designing and building electric bikes. He noticed that most eBikes are unnecessarily heavy and expensive due to the exotic frame designs, additional materials and superfluous features crammed into the eBike. What's more - these eBikes no longer look, feel, or work like a proper bike any more. Fed up with the high prices and poor quality of existing products, he had an idea for how to re-think the entire concept of an electric bike.  Using his existing supplier network and a close knit team of Engineers and Designers he began prototyping and developing what is now the Swytch Conversion Kit.      


Our team of bicycle loving engineers and designers are dedicated to creating fun and affordable products aimed at improving our everyday lives. Here at Swytch HQ a bustling workshop in Hackney Wick, East London, we bring together our experience, passion and hard work to create a product we are truly proud of.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>  My name is Benjamin, I've been a associated and riding with Mike since around 2000 here in eastern North Carolina. This campaign's focus is on giving back to Mike what he has provided to so many others, it as sad to see such a fun loving person struggle so much after an unfortunate accident. Through your contributions we can overhaul Mike's BMW so that he can once again enjoy a reliable and fun ride. No matter how big or how small it may be, every little bit counts and the more we can raise the more we can do for Mike and his family.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>  Obviously the focus of this is to restore Mike's BMW to a showroom finish, possibly some upgrades depending on how much we can raise. Anything above what it takes to get it on the road again will go directly to Mike and his family to help them recover from these years of hardship. If you are familiar with what happened to Mike, the accident in Kershaw and it's aftermath, you know how drastic a change they have suffered through.</p>
<p>   Donations are not the only way that you can help us make a big difference in a deserving person's life, if you can't afford to give, passing this along is just as valuble. Thank you for taking your time to read this and we look forward to hearing from everyone.</p>

① 

Pedal, Gas Motor, or Hybrid Power
Unlike many DIY conversion kits or electric bikes, Phatmoto was specifically engineered as a dual purpose gas-hybrid bike that makes it significantly easier to ride when pedaling alone and doesn't restrict the engine when under gas power.


 


② 

Custom Engineered Bike Frame
Unlike many DIY gas bike conversion kits, Phatmoto's bicycle frame is engineered from the ground up to discreetly hide its fuel tank internally, securely bolts its motor to built-in frame mount, and safely encases the drivetrain to avoid accidents.


 


③ 

Easy Pull-Start Handle Engine
Unlike most DIY gas bike conversion kits using two-stroke engines that require vigorous pedaling turn on, Phatmoto opted for a four-stroke engine with a simple pull-start handle and on/off switch for quick and effortless riding.

*Continue on down to see Phatmoto features in detail
  Gas Bike Enginethat's powerful and efficient. ​When we set out to design our all-in-one motorized bike with Phatmoto, we wanted it to be powerful, easy to use, and have the option to ride wherever.   Slim Four-Stroke Gas EnginePhatmoto's motor safely and securely fastens to its custom engineered frame mount to eliminate DIY brackets, loosening from vibration, and conceals wires.​Phatmoto's 79cc OHV (see details in tech specs) 4-Stroke gas bike engine with automatic clutch allows anyone to travel up to 100 miles at speeds of 25mph on less than a gallon of gas.
Fuel Efficient — Averaging roughly 133 miles per gallon, Phatmoto travels over 100+ miles on 3/4th of a gallon of gas. 
Fuel Usage — Four stroke gas motor operates on regular gas with zero oil/gas mixing like a cheaper two-stroke
Slim Design — At a maximum of 12 inches wide, Phatmoto's engine sits comfortably between your legs.
  Easy Pull-Start Gas Bike EnginePhatmoto's pull handle to start and push button off allows for easy engine use.Unlike two-stroke bike engines that require vigorous pedaling and clutch dropping to start, Phatmoto has opted for a much simpler four-stroke pull start handle for added convenience.In addition, Phatmoto's handlebar off switch quickly kills the motor with the push of a button that allows us to enclose the hot motor and eliminate touching.

Centrifugal Clutch — Four stroke motor with auto-clutch eliminates pedaling for speed and clutch popping to start. 


On/Off Switch — Handlebar throttle and kill switch make powering up and shutting down Phatmoto easy.


 
 
Bike Pedal or Gas Engine Powered
Phatmoto's gas-hybrid bike gives you flexibility to ride by pedaling, engine, or both.

Phatmoto was engineered from the ground up as a dedicated motorized gas-hybrid bike which makes it significantly easier to ride while pedaling.
By streamlining Phatmoto's engine drivetrain, we've eliminated many of the pedaling strains associated with bulky bike conversion kits that give you the freedom to easily ride by pedal and/or engine power.

Pedal Power — Phatmoto is easy to power by bike pedaling only when needed in congested areas. 
Gas Power — Simply pull the easy pull start handle and adjust speeding using handlebar throttle.
Hybrid Power — Combine pedaling and gas power with the engine on to switch between pedal and gas.

 




    Gas Bicycle Framecustom designed for a motor. ​Convenient, gas or pedal hybrid design considerations offer riders added luxuries and safety features that are built directly into Phatmoto's frame whereas gas engine kits rely on costly modifications of traditional pedal-only bike frames.  Fuel Tank Built Inside Bike FrameCleverly designed bike frame disguises bike fuel tank internally on Phatmoto.Rather than bolting an additional gas tank to power its four-stroke engine, Phatmoto seamlessly blends its gas tank internally and conceals its fuel lines to power its four-stroke engine that allows riders to travel up to 100+ miles on a single tank.
Fuel Tank Size — Internal bicycle frame fuel tank holds 2.85 liters or .75 gallons of gasoline.
Eliminates Mess — Large fuel opening allows line of sight to never over pour and reduce spilling. 
Screw-On Top — Secure twist top fuel cap stops leakage while riding and eliminates evaporation.

 
 
Enclosed Drive-Train & Heat Shield
Safety first design prevents burns and protects riders from motorized bike parts.

Phatmoto is first designed for riding when under gas power with design redundancies to reduce motorized biking accidents from hot engine burns and the bike motor transmission which are common among cheaper DIY kit configurations.


Transmission Case — Detachable safety casing is protective while riding and easily removable if needed


Engine Shield — Vented heat shield protects the rider from engine block while dissipating during use.

Muffler Cage — Wired cage encases the muffler to prevent accidental touching while dispersing exhaust.

 
 All-In-One Gas Bikeready to ride out of the box. ​With over two decades experience selling gas bike DIY conversion kits online, we created Phatmoto to be the first all-in-one motorized bike solution that's more affordable, less complicated and has all accessories designed for its higher speeds.  Pre-Built And Ready To RideWith Phatmoto's fully-equipped motorized bicycle, all you need to do is attach the handlebars and front wheel, put in some gas and you're off.

② 

Attach Bicycle Handlebars
Easily attach Phatmoto's handlebars and front wheel to its mostly prebuilt, connect pre-sized plug and play cables to their appropriate locations, and conceal cables on your new motorized gas bike.

<h2><b>Campaign</b></h2>
<p>Our first campaign (<a href=""http://www.tinyurl.com/sharkwheel"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.tinyurl.com/sharkwheel</a>) was a huge success, but this time we are sticking to our California roots and making a wheel dedicated to this great state. Introducing the California Roll!  The California roll is a 60mm, 78a wheel perfect for all types of cruiser boards and Penny boards.  </p>
<p>Although this campaign introduces our 60mm wheel, we are making all of our products available.  We have top-of-the-line complete skateboards and longboards that will arrive to you fully assembled, Penny board completes, 70mm wheels and other cool stuff. See pictures of all rewards down below.</p>
<p>In our first campaign we exceeded everyone's expectations with the high performance aspects of the Shark Wheel. Rave reviews came rolling in and after thousands of sets shipped off, not one return was made.  It took us several months to deliver on our first campaign.....but this time we GUARANTEE we will not be late. In fact, we have already completed the metal molds for our 60mm wheel. We need to raise funds for manufacturing and that is where we need your help Indiegogoers! </p>
<p>The second we reach our goal of $10,000 to go into full production, we will give our manufacturer the green light to start pumping out wheels.  This means that once our campaign ends we will be exactly 2 weeks away from the first shipments.  No need to wait this time. </p>
<p>Backers to this campaign will get the best price the product will ever see. You will be the first to have it and have a small piece in helping reinvent the wheel. Your contributions mean so much to us and we plan to throw in some secret extras for every single person that contributes because you are so ridiculously awesome.</p>

Shark Wheel will be the 'power up' in Grom Social's Iphone game, so download that app and jump on your virtual Shark Wheels!  Buy Perk #1 above and you will be sent Shark Wheel discounts and the link to download the free skateboarding game. 
We have also teamed up with Blaq Sharks, located in Los Angeles. They have a full service operation providing apparel to many of the top brands in the industry. They provide high quality, urban apparel and next level gear that will complement your swagg. Grab a custom Shark Wheel hat or shirt (variety to choose from) on SharkWheel.com

Other Ways You Can Help Shark Wheel was born to LIVE OUT LOUD.  If you want the coolest, highest performance product in the market this is the time to get the best deal before anyone else gets their hands on them.  We want EVERYONE to at least give us a shoutout on social media, or email their contact list.  It's not everyday someone reinvents the wheel-actually it is once every 5,000 years so far!  It took David M. Patrick years to discover this shape and bring it to market.  Please take a second and spread the stoke about the Shark Wheel.
But, even if you can't contribute to the campaign we want to hear your voice sharing our campaign.  Also, we love your questions and opinions and ideas.  Feel free to leave a comment here and we will do our best to answer every single one.

With built-in stabilizer sensors, it's the quickest responding gyroscope to be put into a one wheel machine. Uno Bolt, bolting away with style and precision.      With the GyroForce System, braking is quick and responsive. The brake lever is used if you need to stop the Uno Bolt in its tracks. In addition, the lever can be used to reverse. Charging anything can be a hassle, so we created the best way to charge your battery in a matter of minutes. From 0% drain to 100% gain in a matter of 45 minutes to be precise. Once fully charged you will be riding for 25 miles before needing to charge again. Uno Bolt is equipped with an intense LED flood. The headlight consists of six high power LED lights that produce an unbelievably bright 1000 lumens (12W). Rear has two LED lights with two modes, constant or flash. We have developed a seat that has a high (ILD) Indentation Load Force Deflection. Thus providing comfortability for short and long trips. In addition, the cell foam contours to the bum for the constant flow of circulation. The neoprene material provides the saddle with UV resistant for those sunny days and water repellent for the rainy days.  Uno Bolt is equipped with a horn to notify others that you're around. Horn is push activated and located on the top right handle.  We have equipped the Uno Bolt with an all-terrain tire. Tubeless and big enough to handle the ride from potholes to rough roads ahead. Knowing whats behind you is very important to make decisive turns on the road. The rear view mirror will aid in these situations. It can be attached to the right or left handle grips. The Uno Bolt is equipped with 2 back mounted parking stands that are made of aluminum alloy. The stands have been crafted to look sleek and functional. Our footrest is fully collapsible which offers owners the capability to tuck it away in small spaces. In addition, the rubber foot grips will aid in slip off from the footrest.   Inspired by anime and sketched on paper. Carefully designed and made into a reality with a special team. From the vision of Ron & Sean, the Uno Bolt is the future of transportation. Uno Bolt is patented and manufactured owned.  Xi Testing Uno Bolt's Gyro Force Computer Board  SensorRon Inspecting Uno Bolt's Top Frame   Additional FAQSHow to adjust the height in handlebar?Adjustment of the handlebar is shown below. With or without the handlebar the Uno Bolt can be put into a trunk of a compact car. The video below shows the height adjustment, the locking mechanism for the handlebar, and the removal of the handlebar. How to prevent theft of the Uno Bolt battery?The battery is currently locked in by a screw lock. Now the screw lock can be twisted off to remove the battery from the frame. So we designed the frame so Uno Bolt owners can purchase any chain lock and wrap around the frame.

The vision was to eliminate the use of batteries, thus removing the risk of them running flat and making you vulnerable in traffic.</p><p>Based on a large scale research study* with over 4,000 participating cyclists, we have proven that our induction lights reduce the probability of accidents by 19% when counting all accidents, and 47% for accidents with more than one involved party.

This is referred to as 'daytime running lights' (DRL) – a term that's well known in the automotive industry. Many countries require the use of DRL in cars, as it is proven to drastically reduce the number of accidents experienced by drivers on the road.</p><p>DRL dynamo lights by Reelight have become the standard in Denmark, and today are mounted on 1/3 of all bikes there. The lights have been well tested and proven effective, but now it's time for us to take the concept to the next level.<br/><br/>CIO is the synthesis of advanced technology and design. We have been working hard on upgrading our technology, as we wanted to reduce the size of the magnet module while increasing the power output. What used to be two 12 centimeter / 4.7 inches magnet modules, mounted on each wheel, is now just one small, coin-sized magnet. By upgrading this technology we were able to get approximately six times the output using the smaller magnets. <br/> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499252625/tlpgpqjstu8wowktfa2j.png"" src=""""/></p><p><br/>The main goal for the CIO project was to reinvent the mounting as we believe that the best bike lights are the ones you can mount on your own in just a few minutes.

The wire is made from coated stainless steel, minimizing the risk of breakage or theft.If the bike stops momentarily, the ReePower™ backup system automatically continues to supply power, keeping you safe even when stopping at traffic lights. CIO will carry on flashing for two minutes and then automatically turn off. CIO is intuitive and highly integrated, with no buttons or switches on the bike light. All you have to do is ride, and never again worry whether your lights are on or off. When investing in a CIO bike light, you never have to worry about batteries again, nor should you worry about the maintenance of the product, since the CIO bike lights require minimal care. CIO has a bright flash, and the ReePower™ feature keeps you safe at a standstill. CIO has gone though climatic tests which have proven that it's waterproof and solid in harsh environments. Furthermore, CIO is eco-friendly, due to the reduction in pollution through use of a magnetic system instead of batteries.  For more than a decade, Reelight have been helping cyclists around the world feel safe on the road. This has been possible thanks to our ground-breaking invention of induction bike lights, where the light is powered by magnets that are placed on the spokes of your bike. The vision was to eliminate the use of batteries, thus removing the risk of them running flat and making you vulnerable in traffic.Based on a large scale research study* with over 4,000 participating cyclists, we have proven that our induction lights reduce the probability of accidents by 19% when counting all accidents, and 47% for accidents with more than one involved party. Furthermore, 85% of our induction light users have expressed that they felt safer while riding in traffic.* [Madsen, J. C. O., Andersen, T., & Lahrmann, H. S. (2013). Safety effects of permanent running lights for bicycles: A controlled experiment. Accident Analysis & Prevention, 50, 820- 829] The main reason for this large reduction in accidents was down to the fact that the lights were always on when riding, both night and day. This is referred to as 'daytime running lights' (DRL) – a term that's well known in the automotive industry. Many countries require the use of DRL in cars, as it is proven to drastically reduce the number of accidents experienced by drivers on the road.DRL dynamo lights by Reelight have become the standard in Denmark, and today are mounted on 1/3 of all bikes there. The lights have been well tested and proven effective, but now it's time for us to take the concept to the next level.CIO is the synthesis of advanced technology and design. We have been working hard on upgrading our technology, as we wanted to reduce the size of the magnet module while increasing the power output. What used to be two 12 centimeter / 4.7 inches magnet modules, mounted on each wheel, is now just one small, coin-sized magnet. By upgrading this technology we were able to get approximately six times the output using the smaller magnets.  The main goal for the CIO project was to reinvent the mounting as we believe that the best bike lights are the ones you can mount on your own in just a few minutes. Our solution is called ReeMount™ and is currently patent pending. We are very proud of this solution, as it is highly adaptable and can be mounted by using the key included in the package. As we have already been testing the lights for a while, we are already far in the process of getting them on the market. We have been running a successful Kickstarter campaign and hope our luck on Indiegogo is just as good, since we want to make as many people safe on the roads as possible. We think now is the right time to ask for your support as we feel confident that this product is going to be amazing! The design of CIO is unlike any other bike light ever seen before. We combined what we learned from our previous Kickstarter product NEO, and turned CIO into a compact, sturdy and integrated bike light. The design is focused around the ball-joint, which allows for full adjustability. Through the ball-joint runs a nylon coated, stainless steel wire, which is used to fasten the light around the bike frame. The wire is incredibly strong and helps to ensure that the light stays on the bike and does not get stolen.  Our small design team have dedicated all their time in the design process of CIO. Today a big challenge is that there are various bike types. This makes it harder to develop a bike light that is appropriate for all bikes.Because of this challenge, we have been in close contact with bike dealers, who's expertise we have benefited greatly from. By making a lot of tests and prototypes the design team have been able to design a bike light that can be mounted on most bikes in a few minutes.   CIO fits almost every bike, thanks to ReeMount™, which adapts to any geometry. ReeMount™ is a new and innovative mounting solution that consists of a flexible wire, made out of coated stainless steel. Due to its flexibility, the wire is appropriate for most bikes on the market, which makes CIO a solution for everyone. The lights are designed to be mounted on the left side of the bike.  The CIO bike light is designed to be user friendly. Mounting the CIO onto your bike requires no tools other than the included coin for measurement and the key for tightening, locking, and anti-theft protection.   How to mount CIO in a few easy steps:The first step when mounting the CIO bike light is to place the magnet onto one of the spokes. It should be placed no further than 15 centimeters / 6 inches below the top of the tyre. Step two is to place the lights on to the fork and the seat stay. The lights should be placed parallel to the magnets. To fasten the lights, use the key. The distance between the magnet and the light module can be found by applying the included coin in between the two modules.    Great manufacturers are needed to make the CIO dream come true. The lights will be manufactured in China by our close collaboration partner, who specializes in bike lights. The bike light itself is made out of carbon reinforced ABS, which is durable and can resist bad weather as well as being impact resistant. We chose this material because we find it very important that the CIO bike light can be used in all environments all over the globe. Furthermore, the material is very strong so that the function of it will be intact even if a fall should occur.  The generator is an important part of the bike light, since it generates the power in CIO. The generator consists of a rotating magnet, and a thin wire that makes up the coil. The winding of the coil is a crucial part of the process, since it determines how well the generator performs. Therefore, the winding must be done with exactness. The video below shows how the coil is made. The coil is twisted using a CNC coil-winding machine, which assures consistency and accuracy on each coil.The final mold is based on the first test molds and is currently being fine-tuned before the final approval and pilot production. The electronics inside the bike light have been developed and tested for a longer period of time and the final adjustments on the programming part is almost done. Additionally, we are running a pilot production on approximately 500 lights before we start mass production. This is done to reinsure that both the process and the quality is at its best.  Reelight is a Danish bike light company with a clear goal to make people safe in traffic and thereby save lives. At the same time we try to be as eco-friendly as possible. Our dedication and passion for making high quality bike lights to our users are what drives the company. The company was established in 2003 after our CEO walked the streets of Copenhagen and noticed the lack of lights on peoples bikes. He saw how vulnerable it made them. Right there, he decided that he would make sure that people were visible in traffic at all times. He started collaborating with people who had knowledge in this field and after a lot of hard work the magnetic bike light that never dies was born. Through the years the magnetic bike lights have been developed, and we are always working on making them even better. Today we are so far in the process that we have introduced you to the newest member in the family, the CIO bike light. We hope and believe that all our hard work will end in a success and that we can contribute to make cyclists even safer. Reelight is a Danish manufacturer of bike lights.

Since we have no influence on the taxes we will not be able to guide or answer questions regarding the tax rules in your specific country.  You will have to check the legal requirements on bike lights in your specific country to see if the CIO bike lights are allowed.

After a short period of time I noticed massive improvements. My explosivity and endurance increased, also I noticed my body fat percentage went down. This opened up my eyes and I started studying this method of training...
In my quest to tell more people about CrossXvest EVO™, I was invited by Untold Fitness from Chattanooga, USA. This visit resulted in a massive weightvest tryout-session by some of the best athletes in the world in various disciplines. Everyone LOVED it...

Achieve any goal: weight-loss, endurance, strength, agility, or wherever your imagination takes you” EtchRock, Sports Platform: “CrossXvest EVO™ is without any doubt a highly effective must-have and revolutionary fitnesstool  with built-in hydration system”

<p>STRØM Bikes is the brainchild of entrepreneurs, Morten Birch (age 23) and Nichlas Lloyd (age 26). We met almost a decade ago at a business school in Denmark. We’ve traveled together, worked together and shared hundreds of ideas together. STRØM Bikes started in November 2016 when we designed our first FATBIKE model, <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/strom-bike-the-perfect-e-bike-for-any-ride/x/16057157#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">which later raised more than $450,000 here on Indiegogo </a>out of a campaign goal of $40,000.</p>
<p><strong>Our mission </strong>with STRØM Bikes is to make inner city commuting more sustainable and convenient, and to help accelerate the transition to green transportation.</p>

Hidden battery - detachable for easy chargingSTRØM CITY comes with a 10Ah LG battery that is hidden inside the lower frame. The integrated locking system makes it easy to detach for charging. Charging time is approximately 3-4 hours.With our standard 10Ah LG battery, you get a range of up to 80 km/50 miles. Or upgrade to our 13Ah “GO Further” LG battery and get up to 100 km/68 miles.
 





Integrated lighting systemSTRØM CITY comes with a fully integrated lighting system that starts at the push of a button. This lighting system makes your rides safer and more convenient. Say goodbye to lost or stolen bike lights and hello to peace-of-mind commuting.




Powerful & silent motorTake advantage of up to 350 Watt* of electric motor power, which can take you from 0 to 32 km/h* in a matter of seconds. The motor is built to be durable, powerful and silent. Choose between a 250W (EU model 25kmh/15mph) or 350W (US model 32 kmh/20mph) motor.





DisplaysSTRØM CITY comes with an LED display that allows you to adjust to 6 different assist levels (1-5) and shows the battery level. It also features a fully integrated USB charging system, so you can charge your mobile device on-the-go.

STRØM Bikes is the brainchild of entrepreneurs, Morten Birch (age 23) and Nichlas Lloyd (age 26). We met almost a decade ago at a business school in Denmark. We’ve traveled together, worked together and shared hundreds of ideas together. STRØM Bikes started in November 2016 when we designed our first FATBIKE model, which later raised more than $450,000 here on Indiegogo out of a campaign goal of $40,000.
Our mission with STRØM Bikes is to make inner city commuting more sustainable and convenient, and to help accelerate the transition to green transportation.




We’ve spent countless hours designing and building what we believe is the most stylish, affordable, and feature-packed e-bike ever.To start up production, we need $50,000. As an Indiegogo exclusive, we’re offering a 50 % discount to make sure we reach our goal. This is a UNIQUE limited offer only available on Indiegogo.Running a crowdfunding campaign requires a 100% transparent approach to our backers. We’ll do everything we can to keep you fully informed about the campaign, production, and shipping. And we promise to deliver the coolest e-bike EVER!Don’t just take our word for it. Listen to what other backers have to say about us on trustpilot.com

Outgoing and detail-oriented, Proficient at building and maintaining professional relationships. have taken responsibility for major project initiatives by being part of robust operation teams carrying out back-end operations of market leaders like Amazon and Citi BankWhy we are here?e-commerce is one of the up-trending business across globe, not just the professionals even a housewife or employed individual took avatar to become an online reseller. More than millions of resellers who use social media as a medium to market their product and generate sales/Revenue. On which more than 90% of the re-sellers are not registered.In India, Online users has increased because of one major reason is Cash on delivery. Not all the courier companies are providing this service in market, To avail this service a business have to incorporate with logistics company which required KYC documentation, which cannot be provided by unregistered resellers, If registered, resellers has to commit with minimum number of shipments per month like 2000 or 3000 which is not possible for a small scale re sellers, There are aggregators in market who charges min 2000 INR/ month as subscription to get the logistic pricing. Which will make no value for a small-scale business.To solve this problem Boogybee, has emerged into market as logistic aggregator and supporting resellers with free subscription, Boogybee enable the customer to provide Cash on delivery, SMS Notification, Omni tracking and online payments etc.BOOGYBEEBoogybee is a bootstrap start-up, founded on march 2016, BOOGYBEE as a business it has incorporated with 4 leading courier partners and supporting more than 60 Indian small scale business on logistics fulfilment in very short period with minimum investment, however, to expand and to help the road side vendors, we need to have strong technical support to incorporate with manufacturers and revenue making start-up, business is making consistent revenue for the past 4 months, the business has a chance of multiplying the revenue of min 50 time in a short period if we could able to provide web portal to automate the operation which we do it manually.We see good number of start-ups could do our monthly achieving numbers in a day. Since our practice of operation is lengthier than their current method, Business is not ready to incorporate with Boogybee even though over pricing is more challenging than others.Hence this fund could help us move into next level in our business, In short period we would show good track of customer base in up trending strategy.What We Need & What You Get?This Fund would help us reach more vendors to have them on board as an online reseller will create an opportunity to scale our business vice-versa.
We are looking for 50,000USD for our web portal development for scaling our business, to develop web app for customized checkout page creation which will help us to automate the operation for un organized resellers because many of the vendors does not have website to provide API. Also the fund will be utilized for our running capital for another 10 months.
We have a team which was not hired but built, very small team of 4 but like minded, passionate towards success of our start-up.
The ImpactAs a business Boogybee could utilize the fund to expand its operation to its next level, Boogybee could easily incorporate with start-ups/manufacturer once if Boogybee could provide portal (to automate the operation) which will enable the functions in one click and on single portal.
Customized checkout page is a unique idea which will help a business to do business with their earned followers unlike another market place. Which enable sellers to boost their sale with their own style of marketing. Which has a global potential, where we could get chance to help small scale business across globe to go digital.
Customized checkout page option will help vendors to have portable billing option, where vendor can send online payment link to customer as SMS/email, Customer can make payment to vendors using Creditcard/Debitcard/netbanking/wallets etc. transaction status will be updated to  vendor and payer. which can be used on retail store to make digital/online payment. this can also be used on online shopping option will be available with COD option that will be fulfilled by boogybee logistics support team. 
Like Boogybee, there are few logistic aggregators in market, but they have targeted on successful business. But Boogybee is also targeting on millions of resellers to help them succeed in market.
 Risks & Challenges                              We have a risk if the vendors are unable to use to the process in online business and it is hard to track on everyone’s record.
We have tenured e-commerce analyst from ecommerce legends, where they could help us overcome this problem.
Boogybee will set an account manager for every user, will track records & assist periodically, will be responsible for improving the number of sales of respective.
This practice could help vendors to gain knowledge on online business, soon or later.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We do apologize for this, but Indiegogo has an limit of only 5 items for each options, so we had to merge 700C and 29in together. A separate survey email will be dispatched to those who selected the 700C and 29in for you to select the correct size. </p>
<p><strong>Q: What's the voltage on the charger? Is it compatible for both 110V and 220V?</strong></p>

The Little Loving Hand is a Vietnamese charity comprised of youth who aim to 
provide support for the less fortunate in the city of Hue. We reach out to 
families and children who are living in unsafe and substandard living 
conditions. 
Having been brought up in this beautiful but underdeveloped city, we realise 
how blessed we are to receive food, education, and entertainment, while 
many out there are still suffering from poverty everyday. We aspire to make a 
difference in our little hometown Hue and eventually across Vietnam in the

   What We Need & What You Get



February is drawing near, which means that the most awaited festival – Tet, 
or New Year – is approaching. Many usher in the New Year by taking a few 
days off from work, organising reunions with family and friends, and spending 
a little more than usual on oneself and others. 
As we are aware of those who struggle to make ends meet on a daily basis, 
we were hoping to spread some joy and good fortune around us this New 
Year. We paid a visit to one of the poorest villages in Thuong Long, Nam 
Dong, Hue, where Co Tu, an ethnic minority, are living. A majority of people in 
this community are victims of poverty and disability, and many of the children 
are orphans. 
The Little Loving Hand wishes to celebrate a joyful Tet with the Co Tu this 
year. To help them out, we hope to raise funds worth 1,500 USD which will 
cover:
- 103 gifts worth 515 USD in total for 103 poor Co Tu families, and
- 50 gifts worth 500 USD in total for families seeking special aid.


     The Impact 

Every little bit of help goes a long way. We would deeply appreciate any contributions you may have to offer. Thus far, we have received:- 2,300,000 VND (= approx. 115 USD)- 2 large bags of clothing- 25kg of riceWe know that it will be a challenge to meet our goals, but if each of us just shares that one extra coin, we can help usher in the most unforgettable Tet for the Co Tu and bring smiles to their faces!

Other Ways You Can Help 

All forms of support are welcome! Clothing, books, food – anything. 
Something small from you could mean a lot to us and the Co Tu people.
Thank you so much for your time and support.

New Version 2.2:Available at www.propella.bike

 

 
Propella is an electric pedal-assist bicycle that is elegant, fun to ride, and easy to use. The 2nd generation of Propella combines high-quality components with the latest technology to create a lightweight electric bike that rides and feels like a traditional road bike.
Our 250W Bafang motor helps you glide up hills without exhausting yourself, and our portable, detachable and lockable 6.8Ah Panasonic battery pack gives you up to 35 miles of range. Simple, intuitive pedal assist controls mean riding a Propella 2.0 feels just like riding a standard road bike – only better.
 



 

 

 

 
 


               

 
Propella's mission is to bridge the gap between regular bikes and electric bikes (eBikes). We strive for simplicity, and our minimalist design allows us to achieve our goal by eliminating unnecessary features and focusing on essential elements.
""A great E-bike must be a great bike in the first place""
Propella avoids the excessive weight and cost of traditional eBikes. With just the right amount of power, Propella transforms a traditional road bicycle into an extraordinary electric vehicle.
             At a remarkable weight of 34.5 lbs (15.6 kgs), the Propella 2.0 is classified as the lightest electric vehicle in its class.Benefits of lightweight E-Bikes:
Easy to lift and carry
Shorter stopping distance
More efficient (longer range) 
   
Thanks to Panasonic's latest lithium-ion technology, the 2nd generation of Propella eBikes are equipped with an all-new compact and portable battery pack that uses high-capacity battery cells.  

Removable with anti-theft lock
15 - 45 miles (24 - 56 km) of range
2.5-hour charge time
Charged with standard wall outlet
Ultra-lightweight at 3.5 lbs (1.6 kgs)

    A 250 watt geared hub motor is seamlessly integrated into the rear wheel hub and is the perfect solution for adding an extra boost to your ride.Whether you’re commuting to work or just riding for fun, electric assist can help you reach your destination with ease. Bike farther, faster, and longer thanks to added electric power.    

       
Choose your pedal assist (PAS) level from the LED display and enjoy the boost of electric power!  The higher the PAS level, the more power from the motor. Or simply select level ""0"" for a classic bicycle experience.
Pedal assist starts when you start pedaling and stops when you stop pedaling - simple as that!
 

A great electric bike must be a great bike in the first place. The 2nd generation of Propella boasts excellent ride quality due to a combination of proper weight distribution and quality bicycle components.          
 We've discovered that a single-speed electric bike is quite capable of climbing most hills. A single-speed Propella is lightweight, sleek, and streamlined, and ranks very high in terms of reliability. If you prefer having the flexibility of gears, you may consider choosing the multi-speed (7 speeds) option. The multi-speed option is equipped with a  Shimano Altus 7-speed derailleur and shifter system at an extra cost of $250. The multi-speed option adds a bit of weight (about 1.5 lbs), more moving parts, and requires occasional maintenance just like any other bicycle with gears. However it provides the benefit of incline and long distance riding without the need for electric assist.               
   
After being inspired by concept electric vehicles, we wanted to develop an electric bike that riders could be proud of.  We've put a lot of thought into the aesthetics of the design since day one so that Propella riders can be guaranteed to own the most beautiful electric bike in the world.
  The Propella 2.0 frame is a blend of road bike and mountain bike to provide a one-size-fits-most geometry. The seat post can be adjusted to accommodate a rider's height.

       
Special thanks to Indiegogo and all the backers who helped make Propella Version 1.0 a reality and gave life to a revolutionary electric bike. We successfully developed the 1st generation of Propella eBikes and were honored to receive great feedback and media coverage.

<h2>What is it?</h2>
</div>
<p><strong>SensePod</strong> is a collision avoidance system intended for motorcycles, but it can also be used for bicycles and scooters (you can affix it to anything with a non-porous surface). Its purpose is to detect cars within collision range of a motorcycle so that the user is able to make prompt decisions about the next action he or she should take in a crisis situation. <strong>This is not intended to replace your brain! You should always perform head checks when changing lanes!</strong> SensePod's purpose is to take a stab at identifying options. If a car pulls out 150ft in front of a motorcycle traveling 45 mph, in one second the motorcycle has traveled 66ft. On a multi-lane roadway, there are two options: brake, or change lanes. It takes 1 second on average to respond to any stimuli, another second to perform a head check... 132ft have now slipped by without any action taken. The SensePod will let the rider know if a vehicle is obstructing a lane next to them, letting them take the appropriate action of braking, changing lanes with a head check, or a combination of the two. It uses ultrasonic sensors, a PCB with Arduino code, a few wires, an <strong>EXTREMELY COOL 3D PRINTED HOUSING!</strong> such as this one-</p>

<p>Presenting our masterpiece, the first <strong>truly affordable E Board</strong>:<br/><strong>LongRunner - the Long-Range Low-Price eSkateboard!</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>We are so excited to have been able to source the most affordable parts and in our workings with designers and engineers from Asia, Europe and USA, we have an excellent design that is simple, functional but most of all: <strong>long lasting and very cool.</strong></p>
<p>We hand assemble every skateboard and have it tested for functionality, nothing is more important than the durability and reliability, with LongRunner you get both and it looks great!</p>
<p><strong>High and smooth acceleration with sensored brushless HUB-Motor, means you can skate even manually (without motor)! </strong><strong>The LongRunner instantly reaches high final speeds of up to 15-20 km/h, and ranges of 10+ Km on its integrated battery. With its smart ExTender Hub, it accepts multiple batteries and our newly developed RangePak easily triples your range, and maintains high Speeds as if you just refreshed your batteries! Even more beautiful: With another external power source, the SmartExTender V2, you can even quadruple range and increase Speed by 40%!</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495444030/imu60ugc5uwsdmbntbat.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><u>What is the <strong>LongRunner</strong>?</u></h3>
<p>The LongRunner is  a custom-developed eSkateboard that is based upon a <strong>smart selection </strong>of standard and low-priced but perfectly working and high quality components. Numerous Asian eSkateboards look alike from the outside, but controllers, batteries, motors used often differ a lot! And many of these similar-looking ""drive trains"" we tested did not work smoothly at all! Not because they were all bad, but mainly because they had a few wrong parts, they were not configured correctly or simply not used to their full potential! Therefore, we developed the LongRunner!</p>
<p>LongRunner was initially developed with the help of Kickstarter crowdfunding, to provide a flawlessly working and super-performing eSkateboard at a budget price. LongRunner's circuitry <strong>enables you to use your custom batteries </strong>at two different voltages: 29 and 42V for super (dangerous!) high speed!<br/><strong>The first batch is already in production at our Asian factory, thanks to the help of KS community.  </strong></p>

<li>Selection of perfect and low-priced components</li>
<li>Standart Housing &amp; wheels and hand-piched &amp; measured electronics</li>
<li>ExTender Hub for future-proof upgrades!</li>
<li>ExTender Hub for connection of massive range extending RangePak</li>
<li><strong><i>➜ MoreTechnical Specs can be found in the FAQ section!</i></strong></li>
</ul><div>
<h3><u>What is the <strong>RangePak</strong>?</u></h3>
<p>The RangePak is a smart composition of high quality, meticulously (UN 38.3-) tested cells in a 7S2P high energy density battery, enclosed in  a protective housing, a fabric-bag, and connected to a neat, safe, well-tested and high current-capable spiral cable that can be attached, upon demand, to your eBoard's smart ExTender Hub (basically a plug on the board). The RangePak can go to your preferred belt, backpack, pocket, but even directly onto the board, simply wherever you like and adapted to your skills!</p>
<p>We had many discussions, and mainly People who never tried criticised the cable, but after they tried, everybody was conviced: With the eSkateboard, once you have a little practice, the <u>use of the cable is totally fine and imposes no significantly increased risks to the rider</u>.  Instead, it enables you to get <strong>as many RangePaks as you wish and riiiiiiiiiiiiddeeeee the whole day long</strong>!</p>

When we first got into contact with electrical skateboards and got to try it, there was this ""wow-feeling"", this truly amazing feeling that may remind a surfer of riding a wave with ease, yet in complete silence.

We started to think about how to create such a nice toy at a decent price. Such amazing toy should be available and affordable for everybody. A good electrical speed controller (ESC) and decent hub motors as well as standard skateboard components may be required, and these components may not necessarily cost 500 dollars... at this time, our idea was born: We have to create an affordable eSkateboard, affordable for everyone!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495447015/kaxaoyokqjmshrtsd1y2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>After careful testing of different variants of cost-effective motors and controllers we realized that the ""ready to use"" products that were offered had significant flaws and in some cases even unbearable safety issues. Several aspects were very important for us and simply no issue to the trade-off between performance and price: Motor ratings, ESC programming and solid battery-pack assembly...</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1495447036/hcfqthfjnfyctwd3qtfd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Finding the right batteries is a real challenge: Cheap high-capacity batteries are often overrated, the specs are wrongly declared, in fact they might work at low-currents but definitely not in a high-current application such as a skateboard or hover board. High-quality Samsung, LG, Panasonic or Sony-cells are mostly available as either high capacity or high C-rating, with both high Capa + high-C-rated cells being truly expensive. We therefore aimed at a compromise, using a standard, rather low-capacity but well-assembled battery pack for our basic version. We had a look at every single cell, looked at discharge- and charge characteristics and compared temperatures of the cells to high performance batteries from Samsung (29E and 35E). Since charging of any li-cell, regardless of being a high-quality or a low-quality cell, requires strict limits, we decided that our on board battery must be equipped with a battery management system that provides a single cell surveillance function, realizing overcharge and over-discharge protection at the level of the single cells. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/016/391/190/6e64c0dfd95565eebff6a1dc9cea5fc8_original.gif?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1493125787&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=4ebf4974ffb0a90db3851340846ad8ea"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>During our tests we did not experience any critical overtemperatures or thermal runaways of our batteries, even at increased stress. Capacity, depending on the current drawn and the discharge cut off voltage, was within our expected range. Instead, not a single of the numerous ""high-quality"" cells had a capacity that was close to the rated capacity.

These skateboards that we initially came in contact with in Hong Kong were of outstanding quality but were also offered at an extremely unattractively high price. At the same time, components used in RC planes and even hover-board copies were offered at a much, much lower price.

We are so excited to have been able to source the most affordable parts and in our workings with designers and engineers from Asia, Europe and USA, we have an excellent design that is simple, functional but most of all: long lasting and very cool.
We hand assemble every skateboard and have it tested for functionality, nothing is more important than the durability and reliability, with LongRunner you get both and it looks great!
High and smooth acceleration with sensored brushless HUB-Motor, means you can skate even manually (without motor)! The LongRunner instantly reaches high final speeds of up to 15-20 km/h, and ranges of 10+ Km on its integrated battery. With its smart ExTender Hub, it accepts multiple batteries and our newly developed RangePak easily triples your range, and maintains high Speeds as if you just refreshed your batteries! Even more beautiful: With another external power source, the SmartExTender V2, you can even quadruple range and increase Speed by 40%!

What is the LongRunner?
The LongRunner is  a custom-developed eSkateboard that is based upon a smart selection of standard and low-priced but perfectly working and high quality components. Numerous Asian eSkateboards look alike from the outside, but controllers, batteries, motors used often differ a lot! And many of these similar-looking ""drive trains"" we tested did not work smoothly at all! Not because they were all bad, but mainly because they had a few wrong parts, they were not configured correctly or simply not used to their full potential! Therefore, we developed the LongRunner!
LongRunner was initially developed with the help of Kickstarter crowdfunding, to provide a flawlessly working and super-performing eSkateboard at a budget price. LongRunner's circuitry enables you to use your custom batteries at two different voltages: 29 and 42V for super (dangerous!) high speed!The first batch is already in production at our Asian factory, thanks to the help of KS community.  

Selection of perfect and low-priced components
Standart Housing & wheels and hand-piched & measured electronics
ExTender Hub for future-proof upgrades!
ExTender Hub for connection of massive range extending RangePak
➜ MoreTechnical Specs can be found in the FAQ section!

What is the RangePak?
The RangePak is a smart composition of high quality, meticulously (UN 38.3-) tested cells in a 7S2P high energy density battery, enclosed in  a protective housing, a fabric-bag, and connected to a neat, safe, well-tested and high current-capable spiral cable that can be attached, upon demand, to your eBoard's smart ExTender Hub (basically a plug on the board). The RangePak can go to your preferred belt, backpack, pocket, but even directly onto the board, simply wherever you like and adapted to your skills!
We had many discussions, and mainly People who never tried criticised the cable, but after they tried, everybody was conviced: With the eSkateboard, once you have a little practice, the use of the cable is totally fine and imposes no significantly increased risks to the rider.  Instead, it enables you to get as many RangePaks as you wish and riiiiiiiiiiiiddeeeee the whole day long!

Enables longer lasting high speeds & longer range (3X)
can be charged with the regular supplied fast-charger
RangePak: triples your range

  UPDATE: CURRENT PRODUCTION STATUS  The production of the Longrunner has started - 100 units per day are being assembled right now and shipped to our warehouses.  Our very first contacts with skateboards lie far back, and at that time nobody ever thought about an ""electrification""... When we first got into contact with electrical skateboards and got to try it, there was this ""wow-feeling"", this truly amazing feeling that may remind a surfer of riding a wave with ease, yet in complete silence. The next thing we did was ask for the price, and when we realized that this beautiful toy was offered at several hundred of dollars we were really disappointed and suddenly realized that this was probably the main reason, that there are still only so few of these boards out there. Didn't we just see these Segway-like ""hover boards"" for a mere 200 dollars flooding the markets? These hover boards are electronic gadgets that seem far more complicated than a simple skateboard. We started to think about how to create such a nice toy at a decent price. Such amazing toy should be available and affordable for everybody. A good electrical speed controller (ESC) and decent hub motors as well as standard skateboard components may be required, and these components may not necessarily cost 500 dollars... at this time, our idea was born: We have to create an affordable eSkateboard, affordable for everyone!After careful testing of different variants of cost-effective motors and controllers we realized that the ""ready to use"" products that were offered had significant flaws and in some cases even unbearable safety issues. Several aspects were very important for us and simply no issue to the trade-off between performance and price: Motor ratings, ESC programming and solid battery-pack assembly...Finding the right batteries is a real challenge: Cheap high-capacity batteries are often overrated, the specs are wrongly declared, in fact they might work at low-currents but definitely not in a high-current application such as a skateboard or hover board. High-quality Samsung, LG, Panasonic or Sony-cells are mostly available as either high capacity or high C-rating, with both high Capa + high-C-rated cells being truly expensive. We therefore aimed at a compromise, using a standard, rather low-capacity but well-assembled battery pack for our basic version. We had a look at every single cell, looked at discharge- and charge characteristics and compared temperatures of the cells to high performance batteries from Samsung (29E and 35E). Since charging of any li-cell, regardless of being a high-quality or a low-quality cell, requires strict limits, we decided that our on board battery must be equipped with a battery management system that provides a single cell surveillance function, realizing overcharge and over-discharge protection at the level of the single cells. During our tests we did not experience any critical overtemperatures or thermal runaways of our batteries, even at increased stress. Capacity, depending on the current drawn and the discharge cut off voltage, was within our expected range. Instead, not a single of the numerous ""high-quality"" cells had a capacity that was close to the rated capacity. Therefore we decided to stick with the ""standard"" batteries for the ""standard"" version of the LongRunner that seemed safe and according to our measuring capabilities the pack seemed definitely not ""dangerously overrated"". Each battery is also equipped with a nicely assembled battery management system which worked during our testing as expected.The on-board energy storage system is definitely not a ""Ferrari""- but hey, that was never our intention when creating an ""affordable"" eSkateboard. ""Hot swappable"" battery packs are nice, no doubt, we thought about it, but assembly cost was much higher.

<p>The Ride Bikes' Radiant Carbon is an innovative Class 1 electric bike with Stepless Auto-Shifting AND a single-body Universal Fit Carbon Fiber Frame, mindfully designed by Tony Ellsworth for riders from 5’ to 6’4”. It is packed with enough power to ride more than 100 miles with a carbon belt drive that will last you for more than a decade. <i><strong>What makes it the world's most advanced Class 1 electric bike is its intuitive combination of world-class technologies that allow you keep your cadence even when you face a hill or gravelly surface while seated comfortably on a fully balanced universal fit carbon fiber frame. </strong></i>It's not just ""parts hanging on a cheap frame"". The Radiant Carbon intelligently reads your bio response using cadence, torque and speed sensors to tell the motor and transmission when to shift, how to shift and how much electric boost to give so you can keep your riding pace without having to think about it. </p>
<p><strong>Imagine getting the full wide-gearing experience of a high-end mountain bike without having to shift gears or deal with rusting chains. </strong>Watch this avid mountain-biker's reaction after trying the Radiant Carbon:</p>

The Radiant Carbon intelligently reads your bio response using cadence, torque and speed sensors to tell the motor and transmission when to shift, how to shift and how much electric boost to give so you can keep your riding pace without having to think about it. 
Imagine getting the full wide-gearing experience of a high-end mountain bike without having to shift gears or deal with rusting chains. Watch this avid mountain-biker's reaction after trying the Radiant Carbon:


 

If you haven't heard of Tony Ellsworth, it may surprise you to know he's been building and releasing high-quality, high-end carbon fiber mountain bikes for more than 30 years. Ellsworth is a notable name in the cycling world. He holds 14 international patents and is a rare recipient of the Popular Science Grandmaster Recreational Equipment Award. His bikes have been enjoyed by the bike pro and the everyday person alike.
Now, here we are. Tony wanted to build an electric bike he'd want to have for himself. But, also one that would allow the average person to experience the awesome full wide-gearing of a mountain bike without ever having to think about shifting. 


 
Whatever level you contribute at, you'll be able to:
 


How our ""perks"" work:

Your deposit (the ""perk"" you choose) determines when you will get your Radiant Carbon shipped and how much of a discount you receive.
Once you make your deposit, we will contact you to schedule a one-on-one video call with Tony.
Before we ship your Radiant Carbon, we will need you to pay the balance for the e-bike at the discounted price you're receiving based on your ""perk"" deposit. Financing will be available after the Indiegogo campaign for you to pay the balance if you want to do it this way.
Once final payment is received by the deadline date stated in the ""perk"" you choose, we will ship your Radiant Carbon from among the units shipping in the month that your ""perk"" guarantees delivery. 

 

With more than 30 years of high-end bike manufacturing experience and relationships, Tony Ellsworth and his team are well-equipped to overcome many of the challenges one may face in bringing an electric bike to the market.
The delivery of your Radiant Carbon e-bike is guaranteed with your deposit at any level. Watch Tony's visit with the team at our fulfillment center in San Diego to inspect the Radiant Carbon shipment:

 


We understand that some of you may not be able to contribute at the level we are asking (at this time), but you may still want to be a part. You can still be a part by helping us spread the word by sharing our campaign with your friends and family.",27.0,3,"1 Campaign

We have learnt a lot our first Kickstarter, the most important lesson being: listen to the backers. To make sure we designed the best possible product for the Mk II, we used 20 of our Kickstarter backers in our testing program where they put the board to the test with daily rides sending weekly performance reports straight to our engineering team. Taking on board what our test riders had to say, we perfected our Mk II design to ensure that we would deliver an incredible product.   The Mk II features the latest technologies allowing it to boast some of the most impressive features as well as specs of any board out on the market The Mk II motor kit is built around in-wheel hub motor technology. Our hub motors give the kit its sleek look and removability while still delivering 2000W of power to the ground each to give the Mk II's remarkable performance. The compact design also allows for our boards to free-wheel like a standard longboard without significant resistance. We build all our boards to a high-quality standard to ensure that all our customers get the most out of the motor kits. Our assembly process includes rigorous quality control systems and we use the highest quality materials practically obtainable. The kits are made modular so that in the case of a breakdown, it can be quickly and efficiently repaired by replacing specific parts rather than fully replaced each time.  2WD TO 4WDSlap two Mk II kits onto a single deck to create a more powerful 4WD ride. The Mk II's modular design allows for each motor kit to be paired together on single deck for 4WD or for each to be mounted onto separate decks to create two standard boards.USE ANY DECKInstall the Mk II and its front trucks like any ordinary trucks on any standard skateboard deck. Strap the Mk II onto the board of your choice to create the perfect ride for you.ON-ROAD TO OFF-ROADEasily swap out our standard on-road wheels for larger, grippier off-road wheels at any time. Swap out your ride-to-work on-road wheels for your off-road wheels. Change your wheels easily at any time to match your riding style and environment. REPLACEABLE BATTERIESQuickly swap out your dead battery for a fresh one to instantly double your range and keep the ride going. Bring a few extra batteries in your bag to even triple or quadruple your range. KEY FEATURESThe Mk II 4WD is the most powerful electric skateboard currently on the market with a total of 4000W of power allowing for extreme hill-climb capability. The 4WD is capable of climbing hills of up to 43%, easily steeper than the steepest hills in most cities. Check out what the 4WD can do.

We call our bikes AWD rather than 2wd as they operate as a smart system or what people call ""posi-traction"". The bike is always rear wheel drive except when the rear wheel slips. At that instant, the power of the slipping rear wheel will transfer power to the front wheel overrunning clutch, thus pulling the bike forward. When that happens, the rear wheel will find a new point of traction and then the power will go back to rear wheel. So it is amazingly efficient and only transfers power when you need it.  </p><p>In summary, the bike becomes a traction machine on hill climbs, but even more impressive is the ability to have a traction control system on fast downhill descents. If the front wheel decelerates while going down a hill and around a loose corner (skids), the slowing front wheel will be pushed along by the rear wheel, thus allowing the rider to have a controlled two wheel slide. Picture a rally car sliding around a corner but still having total control.   </p><p>All Wheel Drive is much more noticeable than anyone would think. And for the 2.3lbs added weight, if you're an aggressive rider, or just like traction, AWD can't be beat!</p><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To accomplish this amazing expedition across Antarctica  starting in December of 2017, Kate needs to raise over $300,000 for travel, support, film crew and other expenses.  As the builders of the bikes, we at Christini need to raise the initial $20,000 to finish the machined parts in order to produce the first AWD Fat bikes.  All of the proceeds of the Breaking The Cycle perks will go to the expedition.  5% of all the AWD Fat bike sales will go towards Kate's expedition.  We know that raising all the funds through this campaign will be difficult, but we are hopeful that we will be off to a great start with your help!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Help be a part of history and join in the effort to fund Kate's expedition across Antarctica.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't help us with our campaign at this time, you can still donate to Kate' expedition by going directly to her website at <a href=""http://www.kateleeming.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.kateleeming.com</a></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The CHRISTINI AWD Fat Bikes are not the first bikes we've made.  In fact, the first mountain bike we ever made was back in 1999.  We collaborated with many other companies and have worked with and tested with some of the industry leaders like Geoff Ringle and Gary Fisher (who loves our bikes!).   We've been building weird/cool stuff for over 15 years. </p>
<p>Our goal with this campaign is to help Kate get succeed in one of the most ambitious biking expeditions of all time and making it across Antarctica via the South Pole!</p>
<p>With that said, we will complete each and every order that we receive.  We promise to stick to the initial limited special edition delivery timeline and will roll out the remaining bikes in a first ordered, first out the door delivery schedule.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about our ability to deliver and customer service, just search the web for what other customers have to say.  We pride ourselves in being honest and fair and never letting anyone down.</p>
<p>Thanks for your support!  </p>

And for the 2.3lbs added weight, if you're an aggressive rider, or just like traction, AWD can't be beat!
What We Need & What You Get
To accomplish this amazing expedition across Antarctica  starting in December of 2017, Kate needs to raise over $300,000 for travel, support, film crew and other expenses.  As the builders of the bikes, we at Christini need to raise the initial $20,000 to finish the machined parts in order to produce the first AWD Fat bikes.  All of the proceeds of the Breaking The Cycle perks will go to the expedition.  5% of all the AWD Fat bike sales will go towards Kate's expedition.  We know that raising all the funds through this campaign will be difficult, but we are hopeful that we will be off to a great start with your help!

The Impact
Help be a part of history and join in the effort to fund Kate's expedition across Antarctica.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't help us with our campaign at this time, you can still donate to Kate' expedition by going directly to her website at www.kateleeming.com

Risks & Challenges
The CHRISTINI AWD Fat Bikes are not the first bikes we've made.  In fact, the first mountain bike we ever made was back in 1999.  We collaborated with many other companies and have worked with and tested with some of the industry leaders like Geoff Ringle and Gary Fisher (who loves our bikes!).   We've been building weird/cool stuff for over 15 years. 
Our goal with this campaign is to help Kate get succeed in one of the most ambitious biking expeditions of all time and making it across Antarctica via the South Pole!
With that said, we will complete each and every order that we receive.  We promise to stick to the initial limited special edition delivery timeline and will roll out the remaining bikes in a first ordered, first out the door delivery schedule.
If you have any questions about our ability to deliver and customer service, just search the web for what other customers have to say.  We pride ourselves in being honest and fair and never letting anyone down.
Thanks for your support!  
Steve Christini

<p>Hello!</p>
<p>We are Shellock, a logistics Startup set-up in Barcelona. In May 2019, we met in the first maritime and blue logistics startup weekend, held in Barcelona by Techstars. Without knowing each other beforehand, we created the team and the idea of Shellock came up, after an intense and fun brainstorming session. The concept was so inspiring and enlightening, that motivated us to the point where we were working so synchronized that it felt like we had known each other since forever. We spent three days there from morning to night, shaping the concept, developing the business plan, researching for competitors and making the presentation. On the third day in a 5 minute-pitch, we presented Shellock before a jury integrated by high-rank professionals of the maritime and logistics industry and consolidated entrepreneurs. We placed second, it was huge emotion for the team, but we did not even know our lives were about to change. After the award ceremony, few managers from logistic enterprises approached to us, asking if we were going to make Shellock real. We looked at each other’s face with a smile, and said yes.</p>
<p>In January 2020 we partnered with the Universitat de Barcelona and we moved to its co-work space known as StartUb! In February, we started the Santander Incubation program “Explorer”. In April we were chosen for an acceleration program for maritime startups, which will be held in Haugesund, Norway and it's organized by Flow Maritime Accelerator, as you can see in the video.</p>
<p>In order to fulfill the dream of making Shellock real and disrupt the Shipping industry, we need your help. We are running this campaign to cover some expenses for the trip to Norway and to produce the first batch of Shellocks when we finished the program and have our product optimized. You won't be only helping us, you will be part of a big change in the world, helping to reduce the use of plastic and CO2 emissions in one of the biggest industries in the world.</p>
<p>What we need</p>
<p>We are raising 10,000 euros to cover the expenses of two months in Norway, our flight tickets, and the first batch of Shellocks. Considering that the living costs in Norway are high and we are a team of three, 10,000 is a tight budget but enough to sustain us during the program.</p>
<p>We are going to give nice t-shirts, mugs, and some accessories with our logo, nice collection series Shellocks and the space as sponsor on our website.</p>
<p>Challenge</p>
<p>This is a big but exciting challenge, we know we are on the right track. That is why this Accelerator has given us the opportunity to be part of this exclusive program, which aims for big things and changes. </p>
<p>We have a unique team, full of heart, determination, and always willing to go the extra mile. We believe we are making something good for the planet and its life. </p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""><b>The Inventors</b></p>
<p>Matthew Schafer and Kody Herchler both grew up on the west side of Cleveland, Ohio. Matthew is currently a sophomore in college at the University of Cincinnati studying Finance and Management. Kody recently graduated from the University of Cincinnati in Spring of 2014 with a Bachelor's Degree of Business Administration, specializing in Finance. </p>
<p>The two aspiring entrepreneurs are actively seeking ways to help those around them. When Matthew came up with an idea to help prevent the immense issue of texting and driving, knowing distracted driving has become the leading cause of teen driver-related deaths, the two knew they had to pursue the idea.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The Idea</b></p>
<p>Their idea is to develop a mobile phone application they call ""SafeDrive."" The application automatically blocks predetermined notifications from the user's phone once the user exceeds 10 MPH, a program they call ""SafeDrive Mode."" There are two versions to the application; the Individual version and the Teen/Family version. The Individual version allows individuals to choose which settings will be blocked from their phone while in SafeDrive Mode. The Teen/Family version allows parents to choose the notifications that will be blocked from their teens' phones while the teen is in SafeDrive Mode. </p>

<div><b>The Funds</b></div>
<div>Matthew and Kody are seeking funds to help them further their application's development. Thus far, they have had all of the pages of the application designed and developed, the blueprints for the functionality of the application created, as well as a website promoting the application. The two have also applied and received a provisional patent for their product. Lastly, they have purchased hundreds of keychains and T-shirts to help market the product. The two are seeking funds to help finance the final stage of the development for the application - the coding and programming of SafeDrive. This will launch the application to be onto the Android and iOS platforms. Contributors will help the two launch this life-saving application to help prevent distracted driving, the number one cause of teen-driving related deaths. By alleviating the temptation for driver's to use their phone while behind the wheel, SafeDrive will allow for a sound peace of mind while on the road.</div>

It is an act of defiance, celebration, and force. By riding as a mass we are creating a culture where everyone has the right to their own body. Our solidarity is our weapon. By standing together and opposing the charges these two people face, we are able to continue the spirit of liberation and freedom. Please show your support and solidarity with the defendants and your commitment to ending police brutality.<br/><br/>We are a team of community members seeking to support these defendants and help raise money to cover their legal fees.  They are facing jail time of up to ten years and need the support of the community.</span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 9pt;"">On
the day of the Naked Bike Ride, which a few of my friends
had collectively been organizing and looking to take part
in, I was on the beach. I got a call from my previous partner about a
half hour before it started, and she invited me to the bike ride. I had no intention of attending but, I
was feeling good and happy, and the weather was really nice, so I
decided to go. </font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 9pt;"">I
rode my bike to the start point and arrived late, everyone was preparing to  leave. Just
before we left it was passed through the crowd that we would have
police escorts and the route was briefly discussed by
the leaders and organizers. I took my shirt off, put it a
friends' bag and started to follow the ride wearing only a sarong. My sarong was long and  fully covering me when we rode away from Forest Street. </font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 9pt;"">The
ride went downtown and we passed several police along the route. The
police appeared to go about their normal business and were seemingly disinterested with the event.  After downtown, we
stopped at the Hub, my skirt was getting caught in my bike chain.
The atmosphere was that of liberation but as I freed my skirt, I was shy
and embarrassed about being naked. I didn't know what to
do about my sarong being stuck. I told other riders about
my problem and, they eagerly told me to keep it off and continue the ride naked. They were naked and I figured it was the best way to support them and solve my problem. I thought we could be proud of our
bodies without fear of state or social repercussion, because we
stood for a freedom of our own humanity. </font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 9pt;"">So as we were leaving the HUB, I
took off my sarong and put it in my previous partners' rear bucket.
We went toward Fairhaven on the permitted route with
no police escorts as 60 or 70 naked people on all
kinds of bikes would, silly, liberated and very, very, scared.  We
went through Fairhaven and up the back side of the WWU campus. I wasn't even sure how we got there,  I
never attended Western and don't understand the roads that surround campus very well and was very worried when we
headed up there. I was naked and felt as though the safest plan was to continue with the group. <br/></font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 9pt;"">When
we got to somewhere on WWU campus, by a large
three-sided piece of alleged post-modern art, we were stopped by the WWu police.  I was near the back and am  fearful of the
police and get very uncomfortable when they are present. I
was so uncomfortable that I hid behind some of the largest riders praying the
cops wouldn't see me. I heard some yelling about what way to go
and I wasn't sure what was figured out amongst the
police and organizers. All I wanted was to get dressed and go on
with my day pretending it had never happened. I started to feel
shitty and gross with the cop looking at all of us like we were
criminals. </font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 9pt;"">I
knew one way to a safe space on Forest Street, it was right down High
street. I'm not a western student and didn't know when
graduation was and I didn't fully understand the
seriousness of obeying whatever had been set up by the police and organizers.  So I rode to
the left side of the sculpture toward High street. A police
officer got in my way and I tried to ride further to the left.
 I didn't go fast enough so I was tackled by
the police officer trying to get in my way. I was hurt and angry on
the ground and the officer lifted my up both of my arms and threw me
into a wall.</font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 9pt;"">I
said ""Ok, now can i get dressed and go home?""  He
cuffed me behind my back as tight as he could and wrenched the cuffs.
I told him it was too tight and he told me I was being arrested for
indecent exposure and resisting arrest. I asked him to let me get my
clothes that were just in my bike bucket before we left, and he told
me he wouldn't let me get dressed. I was scared and started to try and
turn around to look the police officer. I was naked he was behind me
and it made me really uncomfortable. </font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 9pt;"">I
saw a tent down the way and someone riding off in the direction I was
heading. It looked like there was an event on campus that day. I
wondered if the tents were there to greet us as we rode in. The cop
put me in the car and I wasn't being friendly. Another police officer
showed up and they asked me if I would play nice. I said, ""Yes,
and I'd like you to kiss me,"" sarcastically. Then the
police put a bag over my head. The police went into my bucket
and got my wallet. They called in my ID. </font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 9pt;"">As the police drove me away through the mesh hood I saw people in dressed fancy and in suits. I saw a
huge event in the PAC Theater. I was really confused. A loud
burst came through the speaker and we parked behind the PAC. I waited
in the car unattended for about a half hour. I could see the time on
the dash. I was naked with a hood over my head in the back of a
cop car while people walked by and looked in the window.  I
tried to cross my legs and crunch up to hide myself, as people peered in a pointed at me some of them laughing. <br/></font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 9pt;"">I
saw someone get dragged across the lawn and through the road asking
why he has being detained and telling the police to stop hurting
him.  They put him in a car ahead of me and we drove off.
 The officer told me I was going to jail and what for. I told
him I didn't understand and he said, ""Good."" I asked him to
help me understand and he refused me any further information or
any clarifying questions. </font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 9pt;"">When
we got to the jail I was taken in with a police officer and
jail guard.  My escorts stayed behind me. We stood in front
of a window and a third guard took my property. I was wearing a
bandanna around my neck and the guard who walked me in didn't like
it. He said to the cop, ""I can't believe you let him
keep this on,"" and pulled hard at the knot choking me, he untied it.  I was scared of the amount of
power they had over me and cursed them as they took off the hood. The guard then saw
scars on my arm and pointed to them. He went out of the room, I waited until he brought back 5 more guards. He
pointed my arm out to them and some of the new guards made remarks.
Then they all took me to a shower room together tightly gripping my shoulders and made me
spread my legs, lean over, and face the wall.  There was a bench in the room I asked if i could sit and the guards said no. They told me to
stay there and made it clear I would be hurt if i turned to look at
them, or sat down. I waited in the cold wet shower room, bent over,
and threatened with violence if I moved or turned for about
10 minutes. Then a man came in. I never saw him, but he
gave me clothes and told me I could turn around when I heard the door
click. </font></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><br/></p>
<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;""><font size=""2"" style=""font-size: 9pt;"">At first I was put in a cell alone, then Daniel Myers joined me and I learned he had been arrested while walking into his graduation he had a 500 dollar bail that was paid by his partner, and after a few hours he was released. I was denied bail at first and spent two days in jail until in court my bail was set to 1,500 dollars, and my charges changed from resisting arrest and indecent exposure to assaulting an officer.  <br/></font></p>

In June 2010 at Bellingham's World Naked Bike Ride event, Two people were arrested, Daniel Myers and Timothy Becker. Timothy was tackled off of his bike by Western Washington University police, and subsequently charged with assault of a law enforcement officer. Daniel objected to seeing Timothy shackled, hooded and forced inside a police cruiser naked and was charged with indecent exposure, obstruction of a law enforcement officer and resisting arrest after he .
The Naked Bike ride is a community organized event that brings people together to protest the policing of our bodies-- how we use them and when we show them. It is an act of defiance, celebration, and force. By riding as a mass we are creating a culture where everyone has the right to their own body. Our solidarity is our weapon. By standing together and opposing the charges these two people face, we are able to continue the spirit of liberation and freedom. Please show your support and solidarity with the defendants and your commitment to ending police brutality.We are a team of community members seeking to support these defendants and help raise money to cover their legal fees.  They are facing jail time of up to ten years and need the support of the community.

Timothy Becker's Statement 
On
the day of the Naked Bike Ride, which a few of my friends
had collectively been organizing and looking to take part
in, I was on the beach. I got a call from my previous partner about a
half hour before it started, and she invited me to the bike ride. I had no intention of attending but, I
was feeling good and happy, and the weather was really nice, so I
decided to go. 

I
rode my bike to the start point and arrived late, everyone was preparing to  leave. Just
before we left it was passed through the crowd that we would have
police escorts and the route was briefly discussed by
the leaders and organizers. I took my shirt off, put it a
friends' bag and started to follow the ride wearing only a sarong. My sarong was long and  fully covering me when we rode away from Forest Street. 

The
ride went downtown and we passed several police along the route. The
police appeared to go about their normal business and were seemingly disinterested with the event.  After downtown, we
stopped at the Hub, my skirt was getting caught in my bike chain.
The atmosphere was that of liberation but as I freed my skirt, I was shy
and embarrassed about being naked. I didn't know what to
do about my sarong being stuck. I told other riders about
my problem and, they eagerly told me to keep it off and continue the ride naked. They were naked and I figured it was the best way to support them and solve my problem. I thought we could be proud of our
bodies without fear of state or social repercussion, because we
stood for a freedom of our own humanity. 

So as we were leaving the HUB, I
took off my sarong and put it in my previous partners' rear bucket.
We went toward Fairhaven on the permitted route with
no police escorts as 60 or 70 naked people on all
kinds of bikes would, silly, liberated and very, very, scared.  We
went through Fairhaven and up the back side of the WWU campus. I wasn't even sure how we got there,  I
never attended Western and don't understand the roads that surround campus very well and was very worried when we
headed up there. I was naked and felt as though the safest plan was to continue with the group. 

When
we got to somewhere on WWU campus, by a large
three-sided piece of alleged post-modern art, we were stopped by the WWu police.  I was near the back and am  fearful of the
police and get very uncomfortable when they are present. I
was so uncomfortable that I hid behind some of the largest riders praying the
cops wouldn't see me. I heard some yelling about what way to go
and I wasn't sure what was figured out amongst the
police and organizers. All I wanted was to get dressed and go on
with my day pretending it had never happened. I started to feel
shitty and gross with the cop looking at all of us like we were
criminals. 

I
knew one way to a safe space on Forest Street, it was right down High
street. I'm not a western student and didn't know when
graduation was and I didn't fully understand the
seriousness of obeying whatever had been set up by the police and organizers.  So I rode to
the left side of the sculpture toward High street. A police
officer got in my way and I tried to ride further to the left.
 I didn't go fast enough so I was tackled by
the police officer trying to get in my way. I was hurt and angry on
the ground and the officer lifted my up both of my arms and threw me
into a wall.

I
said ""Ok, now can i get dressed and go home?""  He
cuffed me behind my back as tight as he could and wrenched the cuffs.
I told him it was too tight and he told me I was being arrested for
indecent exposure and resisting arrest. I asked him to let me get my
clothes that were just in my bike bucket before we left, and he told
me he wouldn't let me get dressed. I was scared and started to try and
turn around to look the police officer. I was naked he was behind me
and it made me really uncomfortable. 

I
saw a tent down the way and someone riding off in the direction I was
heading. It looked like there was an event on campus that day. I
wondered if the tents were there to greet us as we rode in. The cop
put me in the car and I wasn't being friendly. Another police officer
showed up and they asked me if I would play nice. I said, ""Yes,
and I'd like you to kiss me,"" sarcastically. Then the
police put a bag over my head. The police went into my bucket
and got my wallet. They called in my ID. 

As the police drove me away through the mesh hood I saw people in dressed fancy and in suits. I saw a
huge event in the PAC Theater. I was really confused. A loud
burst came through the speaker and we parked behind the PAC. I waited
in the car unattended for about a half hour. I could see the time on
the dash. I was naked with a hood over my head in the back of a
cop car while people walked by and looked in the window.  I
tried to cross my legs and crunch up to hide myself, as people peered in a pointed at me some of them laughing. 

I
saw someone get dragged across the lawn and through the road asking
why he has being detained and telling the police to stop hurting
him.  They put him in a car ahead of me and we drove off.
 The officer told me I was going to jail and what for. I told
him I didn't understand and he said, ""Good."" I asked him to
help me understand and he refused me any further information or
any clarifying questions. 

When
we got to the jail I was taken in with a police officer and
jail guard.  My escorts stayed behind me. We stood in front
of a window and a third guard took my property. I was wearing a
bandanna around my neck and the guard who walked me in didn't like
it. He said to the cop, ""I can't believe you let him
keep this on,"" and pulled hard at the knot choking me, he untied it.  I was scared of the amount of
power they had over me and cursed them as they took off the hood. The guard then saw
scars on my arm and pointed to them. He went out of the room, I waited until he brought back 5 more guards. He
pointed my arm out to them and some of the new guards made remarks.
Then they all took me to a shower room together tightly gripping my shoulders and made me
spread my legs, lean over, and face the wall.  There was a bench in the room I asked if i could sit and the guards said no. They told me to
stay there and made it clear I would be hurt if i turned to look at
them, or sat down. I waited in the cold wet shower room, bent over,
and threatened with violence if I moved or turned for about
10 minutes. Then a man came in. I never saw him, but he
gave me clothes and told me I could turn around when I heard the door
click. 

At first I was put in a cell alone, then Daniel Myers joined me and I learned he had been arrested while walking into his graduation he had a 500 dollar bail that was paid by his partner, and after a few hours he was released. I was denied bail at first and spent two days in jail until in court my bail was set to 1,500 dollars, and my charges changed from resisting arrest and indecent exposure to assaulting an officer.

<p></p></div>","SummaryHEAR IT FROM THE KIDS!  Youth in East San Jose want the East San Jose Bicycle Cooperative!In a nutshell:
Cassidy and Adrian, two UCSC graduates and community advocates, are starting a nonprofit bicycle cooperative in East San Jose based around youth and community.
They will be partnering with after school spaces to teach elementary aged students about bike safety, and middle school aged students about bicycle mechanics and sustainability.
This space will give San Jose's at-risk youth a positive outlet to pursue a rewarding hobby while providing a safe and productive after school space for them to spend their time. 

Donations will fund tools, parts, and space for the middle school bicycle clinic, as well as bicycles and promotional material for the elementary school safety classes.
This is a grassroots organization that will rely upon your donation and social support to make it possible.

Large-scale bicycle safety classes are nearly nonexistent in this part of the city, especially in the capacity that we will be offering.  Maintenance clinics like the ones our model will offer are entirely original in the area.  By creating long term partnerships with schools and forming relationships with the students we work with, we will promote bike culture in a positive manner that monthly or yearly safety clinics are unable to do.  We will work in in a holistic and informed manner focused on community interaction, with the capacity to deliver a uniquely tailored service to fulfill the yet to be addressed needs of young cyclists throughout the area.From adjusting brakes to rebuilding hubs, we have experience in both repairing bikes as well as helping others learn how to work on theirsWhat We Need & What You GetStart-up CapitalThe vast majority of your donation will go towards investing in physical start-up capital.  We intend to have two fully operational thrusts under our project's umbrella: safety clinics to be delivered in elementary schools, and maintenance clinics to be operated in middle schools.  To get both these projects off the ground, we will need:
A small ""safety fleet"" of bikes, appropriately sized for elementary school students grades 3-5.

Two canopy tents, for our mobile maintenance clinics.
One set of professional quality bicycle tools, for adult use.
Several sets of introductory level tools for student use.
Several portable bike repair stands.
Several higher capital tools, like a truing stand and a portable vice.
Several miscellaneous bike maintenance tools, like tire levers.
A large quantity of basic repair parts like tubes and brake pads, for maintenance of our ""safety fleet"" and provision of free or cheap parts for middle school maintenance clinics.
Cool gifts and gear to give to students to increase interest in our project and promote bicycle culture such as bells and lights.

<p>Increasing the use of zero-emission vehicles in the US is an issue that many stakeholders – from industry players to regulatory agencies - are trying to tackle through policy change, incentive-based programs and other strategies. Our approach to overcoming the <i>perceived </i>uncertainty of electric vehicles (like all those questions about battery life…) is to recruit new electric vehicle drivers!  We will be successful by making this classy fleet available to more people, specifically drivers from all socioeconomic backgrounds. At the end of the day, car sharing provides an affordable solution for low-to-middle income families and residents who do not own a car or need a second car for specific trips.  That’s the beauty of our solution.</p>
<p>We also address concerns about the availability of electric vehicle charging stations by offering our own turnkey electric vehicle station equipment services. (Yep! This additional service includes initial site consultation, construction management and networking assistance).  We all want to see more on- and off-street charging stations at public locations where car share vehicles will be parked. An exciting development on this front is the City of Los Angeles has installed over 1,000 publicly-available electric vehicle charging stations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and encourage adoption of plug-in vehicles citywide.</p>
<p>We recognize that most drivers are “in the dark” about the basic characteristics of driving an electric vehicle.  To them we say: You don’t know what you are missing!  Several great agencies, including the amazing nonprofit organizations Adopt-A-Charger and the Charge-Ahead Coalition, do powerful work to educate people about the efficiencies and public health benefits of low and zero-emissions vehicles. We are grateful for those efforts. For our part, Green Commuter will be taking the lead in Los Angeles by making electric vehicles attractive and accessible to mainstream consumers. Makes you feel good, doesn’t it?<br/><br/></p>

</div></div>","We are an all-electric vanpool provider in California and the first company to combine vanpooling, car sharing and fleet replacement. This means we can make a greater environmental impact by maximizing the use of our zero-emission fleet. Current vanpool commutes are inefficient. The vans are only used about 6-9% of the week, and just parked the rest of the time. On top of that, standard vanpool vehicles operate on conventional, petroleum fuel and have poor fuel economy. We've developed a new model that utilizes the vanpool vehicle during a substantial portion of the remaining 91-94% of the time as a public car share vehicle or to replace an employer’s fleet vehicle. By doing so, the efficiency between the systems increases the environmental benefits and reduces the costs, allowing us to offer our services at an affordable rate. We will be launching with the premium all-electric, seven-passenger Tesla Model X, the only vehicle in the US market that meets the needs of Green Commuter’s unique and synergistic model. 
Help us meet our goal of $100,000 to catalyze
cheaper and greener commuting and mobility in Los Angeles! All your
contributions will go toward building our fleet. Once we launch, and after you've completed your Green Commuter profile, you will be
able to enjoy exclusive car share use of our state-of-the-art, all-electric Tesla
Model X fleet through whatever perk option fits your lifestyle. Even if we don't reach our entire goal, your perk will still
be redeemable! We're offering up to 70% off our Tesla Model X Car Sharing packages for weekdays and weekends.







Once we launch, you'll be able to rent our all-electric vehicles by the hour, day or weekend from our website, phone or iOS and Android Apps. Our vehicles will be spread throughout Los Angeles. Just make a reservation and unlock the vehicle with your smartphone.




We are committed to using the safest and most environmentally friendly vehicles available to us. The Tesla Model X is the only vehicle in the US market that meets the needs of Green Commuter’s unique and synergistic model.

<h1>What is Community Car Sharing?</h1>
<p>My name is Takehiko Yoshizawa and I am the representative director of Japan Car Sharing Association.</p>
<br/>
<h3>Great East Japan Earthquake</h3>
<p>It is well known throughout the world that Japan was affected by the Great East Japan Earthquake occurred on March 11, 2011. A magnitude 9.0 class earthquake associated with massive Tsunami not only destroyed many houses and facilities, but also killed 15,889 people and 2,598 people are still missing. This earthquake has even triggered the meltdown of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. Nearly 260,000 people have lost their homes and evacuated to the temporary shelters (i.e. elementary school) are still living in the temporary housings provided by the Japanese government. These people are looking forward to move into the post-disaster public housing which is now under construction.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1185514/files/20150130194746-img_4987.jpg?1422676066"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<h3>Setting Up a Car Sharing System in Ishinomaki City</h3>
<p><span><span>In Ishinomaki City, a harbor town of Miyagi Prefecture which suffered the largest losses of life and property, almost 60,000 cars were lost by the Tsunami and serious car shortage was resulted after the Great East Japan Earthquake. As Ishinomaki City is a rather rural city, daily life will be very difficult for those residents without a car. For these reasons, I hastily rushed to the scene for setting up a car sharing system in the temporary housing area by utilizing the used cars donated from all over Japan. Gradually, we started to receive supports and donations from all over the world. We are now having 65 cars for the victims living in the temporary housing areas to share.</span></span></p>
<p> The distinctiveness of our car sharing system is that the whole operation is running solely by the local community and the victims themselves. The local people took all the roles such as management of the car keys and arrangement of the reservations, while the money donated from the car users were used for car maintenance. Voluntary pick-up services were also developed from this system. As this system was originated from the disaster sites and it plays an important role in the community revitalization, we would like to name it as “Community Car Sharing”.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1081994/files/20141208172638-sougei02.JPG?1418088398"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<h3>Our New Challenge </h3>
<p>Recently, we are working to create a new challenge with this Community Car Sharing. Since the temporary housing residents will start to move into the post-disaster public housing from this spring, we would like to implement the same Community Car Sharing by providing electric-vehicles and solar panels to these new public housing complexes for the uses of its new residents. To begin with, a model case of this system will be implemented in a larger-scale housing complex with approximately 200 families.</p>
<p>This program will offer a community model that shares ecology, disaster prevention and transportation. It will certainly be an important factor for creating an eco-friendly society and there is a further important meaning in doing this in the disaster area. Not only using for daily transportation, electric vehicles could also be an important power source during the emergency. Since people in the disaster area have all experienced and suffered several months of inconvenient life without electricity, we believe the electric vehicles carrying electricity could provide the residents a sense of security.</p>
<p>Although Japan is a developed <span><span>country</span></span>, we are still behind on making effective uses of the natural energy resources. In this situation, this campaign may help the local governments in the disaster area of Great East Japan Earthquake to stand up and rebuild their cities into a “Smart City”. If this project succeeds, we will use this activity as a model case for further expansion.</p>

<h1>The Impact</h1>
<p>Ecology, transportation, community revitalization and disaster 
prevention has been the common important themes throughout the world. 
This project is utilizing electric vehicles running by solar energy and 
self-managed by local community to solve these problems. We believe the 
same model could be convertible and implemented to any other regions of 
the world on to solve the same problems.</p>Moreover, we have been 
using 65 used-cars on car sharing after the earthquake and this activity
 has offered considerable contributions to the community’s growth, 
revitalization, and disaster prevention. Since the project is not 
starting with something completely new but to create a livable 
environment according to our past achievements, we believe the project 
will have a high possibility of success.<p></p>

<br/><br/>
<h1>Risks &amp; Challenges</h1>
<p>This project is initiated with the cooperation of the Ishinomaki City municipal government through the financial support of the Mitsubishi Corporation East Japan Earthquake Recovery Fund. However, since enormous amount of funds are still required for the city reconstruction, the municipal government is facing difficulties to spare financial supports to this project. In this respect, we decided to raise more funds through Indiegogo.</p>
<p>At this point, we have already gathered the necessary tools and machinery for this project. However, we still require certain financial backings to maintain and continue our operation. We are seeking supports from all over the world to enable our further development of these new communities in the disaster areas reconstructed after the Great East Japan Earthquake and provide a better living circumstance for the victims there. Moreover, we hope such successful example could also be helpful to other global disasters in the future. Along with everyone’s support to this Community Car-Sharing project, we could develop a beneficial system in this disaster area, Ishinomaki City of Miyagi Prefecture (Japan), and diffuse it to other parts of the world. Therefore, your support is greatly appreciated.</p>

<h3>Do you love visiting Tahoe, but hate driving there?</h3>
<p>If you live in the Bay Area and visit Lake Tahoe over the weekend, <strong>driving is currently the only option</strong>. Let's fix that! Tahoe Convoy will be a new <strong>luxury weekend shuttle</strong>, leaving the Bay Area on Friday night and returning Sunday night, <strong>all year</strong>. Separate routes will extensively cover the Bay Area, with direct access to both the <strong>North and South shores</strong> of the lake. We'll travel on the same <strong>posh buses</strong> that tech commuters enjoy during the workweek, featuring reclining seats, large windows, real-time arrival tracking, WiFi and restrooms.</p>
<p>Are you seeking a relaxing journey to Tahoe? You are not alone! A recent survey revealed:</p>
<ul>
<li>58% of Bay Area residents would ride transit to Tahoe if it existed</li>
<li>38% would visit Tahoe more frequently</li>
<li>24 million people in 10 million cars visit Tahoe each year</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearly there is demand for a better way to get to Tahoe.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509116561/vj7ukz7vqtklvqtdtpvw.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Ride a bus that's <u>faster than driving</u>
</h3>
<p>The worst part about driving to Tahoe are the winter road closures and chain control checkpoints, where cars can be parked on the freeway for hours. To keep on schedule, Tahoe Convoy will parter with state highway agencies to <strong>prioritize bus access</strong>, getting you there faster than driving!</p>
<p>Even on days when Tahoe Convoy is no faster than driving, it will feel faster on the shuttle<strong>. </strong>Passengers<strong> </strong>will be free to <strong>chat with friends, enjoy the scenery, have a drink, or even continue working</strong>, rather than being focused on stressful nighttime driving. </p>
<p>Tahoe Convoy will not own any buses nor employ any drivers. Instead, we will charter from the Bay Area's <strong>fleet of 789 commuter shuttles</strong> that are driven during the workweek but currently parked during the weekend. Every Friday, Tahoe Convoy will dispatch as many buses as necessary to fulfill all ticket purchases, meaning we will <strong>never sell out</strong>, even during an epic powder weekend or the 4th of July holiday. You can count on Tahoe Convoy!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1509116845/hl0lfct0nbtpn5d4de5g.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Do I need a car to get around Lake Tahoe?</h3>
<p>Not at all! The Tahoe Basin is continually enhancing its local <strong>transit and bikeway networks. </strong>New improvements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expanded local bus frequency and late-night hours of operation</li>
<li>Comprehensive bike path network</li>
<li>Dockless bikeshare systems</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, both Lyft and Uber operate at Lake Tahoe. For a <strong>seamless last-mile connection</strong> from your Tahoe Convoy stop to your final Lake Tahoe destination, ridehails can now be <strong>scheduled in advance</strong> through either app from the comfort of the shuttle, with your ride waiting for you at the stop. </p>
<p>There is no reason to bring your car to Tahoe! <strong>Save your money. </strong>Over the 400-mile round trip, <strong>driving your car costs $214</strong>, omitting additional costs for chain installation, car wash, parking fees, bridge tolls, and of course the value of your time. In comparison, a round trip for two on Tahoe Convoy only costs $188.</p>

<h3>Where are Tahoe Convoy routes and stops?</h3>
<p>Two separate routes will provide <strong>extensive coverage across the Bay Area</strong>, with a northern route originating in San Francisco and a southern route serving the South Bay. At Lake Tahoe, two routes will provide <strong>direct access to the North and South shores</strong>.</p>
<p>Every weekend, at least two Tahoe Convoy shuttles will operate, covering the entire network. During higher ridership weekends, additional coaches will be dispatched, enabling the grouping of passengers by destination and creating <strong>express service</strong> with fewer stops and no transfers.</p>
<p>Exact stop locations are still being finalized. In the Bay Area, stops will be located at BART and Caltrain stations, Park and Ride lots, and major employment centers, allowing commuters to head to the mountains on Friday straight from work. Passengers can board and alight at any stop on both Friday and on Sunday; this enables boarding the shuttle from work on Friday night, but on the Sunday return trip, alighting close to home.</p>
<p>At Lake Tahoe, stops will be located at major resorts, and at supermarkets so visitors can procure groceries for the weekend. All stop locations will be covered and well-lighted, protecting waiting passengers from the weather.</p>

<h3>Can I bring my skis and bike on the shuttle?</h3>
<p>Tahoe Convoy will have <strong>ample storage room</strong> for your gear. You can bring your skis, snowboard, boots, and all typical winter equipment.</p>
<p>Outside bike racks on shuttles will be available to customers by requesting access through the ticket reservation. Bikes will also be transportable in bike boxes stored in the luggage compartment without requiring a reservation.</p>
<h3><strong>What will Tahoe Convoy tickets cost?</strong></h3>
<p>You can purchase tickets vouchers right now as perks through this campaign, at <strong>steep discounts</strong>! Vouchers will <strong>never expire</strong>, so lock in these low prices. You can purchase 1, 2, 4, 8 or 10 one-way ticket vouchers, with increasing discounts.</p>
<p>After we commence operation, we expect ticket prices to be about $45-$75 per one-way ticket. Similar to the vouchers, there will be discounts for tickets purchased in bulk, as well as for tickets purchased in advance. We will have a <strong>customer loyalty program</strong> to reward passengers who travel frequently and refer their friends. We also will partner with Lake Tahoe ski resorts and hotels to sell <strong>package deals</strong> combining transportation, lodging and activities with one click.</p>
<p>As a self-sustaining transit enterprise without any government subsidies, Tahoe Convoy will relentlessly focus on the comfort, convenience and safety of the <strong>passenger experience</strong>.

<p>We'll use the money raised through this campaign to file our permits and get up and running. Once we commence operation, we will remain financially solvent through continued ticket sales.</p>
<h3>Can Tahoe locals ride Tahoe Convoy to the Bay Area?</h3>
<p>Of course! Tahoe locals can ride the shuttle west to the Bay Area on any Sunday night, and return east to Lake Tahoe on any Friday night.</p>
<h3>Who is sponsoring Tahoe Convoy, and why?</h3>
<p>Tahoe Convoy is the endeavor of Greg Riessen, Bay Area native, with assistance from his sons. Greg's family has wasted too much time stuck in traffic going to Tahoe. We want to upgrade the travel experience for Bay Area residents seeking their Tahoe getaway, while also preserving the beauty of Lake Tahoe for future generations. Greg is a traffic engineer and transport planner with a reputation for innovation, and Tahoe Convoy is the outcome of several years of investigation and development.</p>
<p>The economy of the Tahoe Basin needs to grow, but is held back by crippling traffic congestion and lack of transit. Meanwhile, pollution from cars has been linked to declining lake clarity and air quality. Beyond improving travel options for Bay Area visitors, Tahoe Convoy will be the foundation of a <strong>sustainable visitor-oriented economy </strong>for Lake Tahoe. By riding the shuttle, not only will you give yourself back those eight hours to relax, but you will also <strong>do your part </strong>to help Tahoe thrive while preserving its pristine environment.</p>

I plan to get the app out in the world by reaching out  with YouTubers and using basic advertising and social media.    Other Ways You Can Help There are so many ways to help and you can help besides funding the campaign.  You can simply get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. Or download the app when it's available on the App Store. Sign up here to be notified when it launches.  http://lnc.hr/SR6Th",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>One of the biggest problems of the environmental debate is that everyone points the finger up to someone else. The driver of a car points up to the airplane, the airplane points up to the giant cruise ship, the cruise ship to the heating and airconditioning of the houses, and these ones accuse the cars, meaning “you pollute the air, so you have to start!”; the result is that nobody does anything.</p>
<p>So let’s start, roaming the streets and cleaning them from the stinky gasoline scooters that pollute the environment. We will replace them with electric scooters which are anyway much better for the mobility in the city, especially in warm regions of the world. It can be a supplement to the car or its replacement or even a replacement to public transportation, as it is not possible to expand public transportation to the extent to be considered a real alternative to a car or scooter.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554196029/kecjg6lhqlpgnee8kqzw.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Most of the Greek population has no possibility to spend 800-1000 Euros or more to replace a stinky gasoline scooter with a new electric scooter, so we need another way.</p>
<p>We offer full service contracts including insurance, service, accessories, spare parts, and repairs. The only thing the costumer needs to do is drive their scooter themselves.</p>
<p>We provide the client with the scooter, replace or repair it on site if necessary, and pick it up at the end of the contract. We do not need a branch network, which saves costs, and the costumer has an excellent service, much better than they are used to. This all around service is very easily realisable in Greater Athens with its “small” living space of 20 x 30 km so that we need just one and only location as office/warehouse.</p>
<p>At least at the beginning we will start with long term rentals concentrated on Greater Athens. Starting with a small model of scooter and a bigger one. Two service contracts that differ from each other concerning, for example in case of excess in case of damage, mileage limit and other Factors. The monthly rental for the smaller scooter will be less than 100 Euros, as we intend to have the monthly rental at about 80 Euros (12-months-contract). As a comparison, the expenses for a monthly ticket for the public transportation (30 Euros) and a couple of times using a taxi because public transportation is on strike or is not on time, it may cost the same, maybe more.</p>
<p>A main target group of our business idea can be for example people who have to wait in the dark at a metro station or a bus station or have to return home after work in the dark, or people working on shifts attending or leaving their work while public transportation is not on duty.</p>

<p>I have been a businessman for 18 years and senior staff in several companies before that. I have been working as a management consultant for big German companies such as the publisher Klett (one of the biggest publishers of school books in Germany), the publisher NWB (the second biggest publisher of legal books in Germany), and Ravensburger (the biggest german producer of games and puzzles).</p>
<p>My first profession was as a book printer and then I followed a further education until I finished my studies in business administration. Having an income from my business in Germany I am not rich, but I can live. I am leading my business remotely per e-mail and phone, and twice a year I am visiting Germany where I have two daughters studying. I love animals and had both dogs and cats since was a child, most of the animals were stray animals from the streets.</p>
<p>I do not have a car for the last 5 years now and when I need a car, I just rent it for a couple of days.</p>

<p>Our Concept is a little bit different from most other concepts I have seen so far.</p>
<h3>real scooters!</h3>
<p>Not these small scooters that seem more to be a toy for children then a vehicle. They may be interesting for short distances, but not for everyday life. The streets in Athens are not in good condition, so sometimes it is really dangerous to use the small scooters with the very small tires that are so trendy right now. The sidewalks are in even worse condition; sometimes the big holes are just covered temporary with any material like planks. I would not like to be on the roads with a small “toy” scooter!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553798664/sblnn5nthcjfndkyuaw3.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>perfect location</h3>
<p>Athens is the ideal location for our activity. Greater Athens is relatively small, in comparison to Berlin it’s just half of the area, but it has the same number of inhabitants. So this area is really ideal especially for the electric scooters and electric vehicles in general that until now their range is kind of limited compared to other vehicles.</p>
<p>The weather is most of the time very good, it has a Mediterranean type climate with more than 2800 hours of sun per year and 348 sunny days. The average temperature in winter is about 12 degrees Celsius and in the rest of the year about 20, 30 and even 40 degrees. Ideal conditions for solar energy and scooter drivers, whom you can see on the roads in masses, unfortunately still with gasoline bikes. Most often they have old, stinky, and loud two-strike engines.</p>
<h3>reputable calculation</h3>
<p>We are not just some adventurers, we calculated in a very serious way the financial requirements. We also calculated some financial reserves for unexpected expenses or delivery delays, so that we can protect ourselves and your money. Especially projects concerning environmental or social protection very often are not well pre-calculated because the main causes are not simply the amount of money and but this is exactly why many of them have not the expected success in the long term.</p>
<p>Our project is different in that we will already have covered all expenses at the time when the first 100 electric scooters are rented, and that is a target we expect to fulfil within 2 or 3 months. As a matter of fact, we already have 15 orders. And still, we calculated for the whole first year all the expenses taking in consideration our needs such as the rent for the location/office, staff etc. At the end of the fifth year we intend to have rented out about 5000 scooters, that’s on average 1 of 1000 Athenians. That’s not a very demanding target but quite the opposite, it’s a really restrained target. To be honest, I expect a much bigger success than just 5000 electric scooters in the streets of Athens.</p>

<h3>a price that anyone can afford!</h3>
<p>As I already mentioned many Greeks can’t afford a new electric scooter and scrap their old one. And they can’t use the current choices that are offered in Athens because they have to pay about 10 Euros per hour for these scooters. That’s too expensive! So we need an other possibility that costs less than 100 Euros per month with a full service contract which is affordable for the inhabitants of Athens. It’s worth thinking about when you need a cheap and easy way to move around the city.</p>

<p>How can more money be invested, in case we fulfil the target and have more money at our disposal. It depends of course on the result of this campaign. We have some brilliant ideas for the next steps.</p>
<h3>development of charging stations with solar energy</h3>
<p>Conventionally produced electricity partly just shifts the problem. Some kilometers away there will be a power station polluting the air. We would like to develop decentralized charging stations providing them with electricity by the use of solar and wind energy. We could develop a type of automated machines where the driver has the possibility to change the battery without waiting for a long time until his own battery is fully charged. We will only provide electric scooters where it’s possible to take off the battery, which on average weights about 8-10 kg. So it’s possible even for a person without enormous strength to handle the battery. Take off the empty battery, put on the fully charged one, and after 2 minutes you are on the road again.</p>
<h3>short term rental</h3>
<p>There are about 11 million people living in Greece. In 2017 nearly 30 million tourists visited the country which means that there is a good possibility to start a short time rental for tourism. City tours with electric scooters or e-squads for disabled persons. We would need rental stations (at least at the port and the airport) and of course more staff, more logistics, and more rents. And we would need an other kind of advertisement.</p>
<h3>company packages – models – locations</h3>
<p>Charging station + scooter + business plan all in one for a good price. Especially for delivery services, postal service etc. The charging station could be designed in a way that it can be used by other scooter drivers as well.</p>
<p>And I am thinking of a bigger model of scooter, a model that is perfectly suitable for longer distances as there are already models who reach a higher speed and can cover a distance of about 200 km or more. The national road to another city of Greece, Patras, is new and in very good condition as well as just 200 km in total distance. It is a perfect distance and possibility for a bigger model of electric scooter.</p>
<p>Or we start at a second location some weeks later, Patras oder Thessaloniki. Sure an island like Corfu or Crete would be interesting for another business model concerning tourism.</p>

</div></div>","One of the biggest problems of the environmental debate is that everyone points the finger up to someone else. The driver of a car points up to the airplane, the airplane points up to the giant cruise ship, the cruise ship to the heating and airconditioning of the houses, and these ones accuse the cars, meaning “you pollute the air, so you have to start!”; the result is that nobody does anything.
So let’s start, roaming the streets and cleaning them from the stinky gasoline scooters that pollute the environment. We will replace them with electric scooters which are anyway much better for the mobility in the city, especially in warm regions of the world. It can be a supplement to the car or its replacement or even a replacement to public transportation, as it is not possible to expand public transportation to the extent to be considered a real alternative to a car or scooter.

Most of the Greek population has no possibility to spend 800-1000 Euros or more to replace a stinky gasoline scooter with a new electric scooter, so we need another way.
We offer full service contracts including insurance, service, accessories, spare parts, and repairs. The only thing the costumer needs to do is drive their scooter themselves.
We provide the client with the scooter, replace or repair it on site if necessary, and pick it up at the end of the contract. We do not need a branch network, which saves costs, and the costumer has an excellent service, much better than they are used to. This all around service is very easily realisable in Greater Athens with its “small” living space of 20 x 30 km so that we need just one and only location as office/warehouse.
At least at the beginning we will start with long term rentals concentrated on Greater Athens. Starting with a small model of scooter and a bigger one. Two service contracts that differ from each other concerning, for example in case of excess in case of damage, mileage limit and other Factors. The monthly rental for the smaller scooter will be less than 100 Euros, as we intend to have the monthly rental at about 80 Euros (12-months-contract). As a comparison, the expenses for a monthly ticket for the public transportation (30 Euros) and a couple of times using a taxi because public transportation is on strike or is not on time, it may cost the same, maybe more.
A main target group of our business idea can be for example people who have to wait in the dark at a metro station or a bus station or have to return home after work in the dark, or people working on shifts attending or leaving their work while public transportation is not on duty.
 


I have been a businessman for 18 years and senior staff in several companies before that. I have been working as a management consultant for big German companies such as the publisher Klett (one of the biggest publishers of school books in Germany), the publisher NWB (the second biggest publisher of legal books in Germany), and Ravensburger (the biggest german producer of games and puzzles).
My first profession was as a book printer and then I followed a further education until I finished my studies in business administration. Having an income from my business in Germany I am not rich, but I can live. I am leading my business remotely per e-mail and phone, and twice a year I am visiting Germany where I have two daughters studying. I love animals and had both dogs and cats since was a child, most of the animals were stray animals from the streets.
I do not have a car for the last 5 years now and when I need a car, I just rent it for a couple of days.
 

                                           

Because I’m personally responsible to leave a clean environment behind me and not a dump. Each of us is personally responsible. 
Because your children want to live!#fridaysforfuture #youthstrike4climateThey fight for their lifes.
Greece may be far away from you and maybe you hardly know the country…. Some sentences from the subject of history at school, some words in the daily news about the financial crisis, the refugees or political tensions between Greece and Turkey. Maybe you have been on holidays in Greece?
A lot of positive things have their origin in Greece and have spread all over the world. Greece is the cradle of the European and western culture in general.
Greece gave birth to democracy, philosophy, and modern medicine. Here you may plant a seed and this seed may save the world tomorrow.
 

Our Concept is a little bit different from most other concepts I have seen so far.
real scooters!
Not these small scooters that seem more to be a toy for children then a vehicle. They may be interesting for short distances, but not for everyday life. The streets in Athens are not in good condition, so sometimes it is really dangerous to use the small scooters with the very small tires that are so trendy right now. The sidewalks are in even worse condition; sometimes the big holes are just covered temporary with any material like planks. I would not like to be on the roads with a small “toy” scooter!

perfect location
Athens is the ideal location for our activity. Greater Athens is relatively small, in comparison to Berlin it’s just half of the area, but it has the same number of inhabitants. So this area is really ideal especially for the electric scooters and electric vehicles in general that until now their range is kind of limited compared to other vehicles.
The weather is most of the time very good, it has a Mediterranean type climate with more than 2800 hours of sun per year and 348 sunny days. The average temperature in winter is about 12 degrees Celsius and in the rest of the year about 20, 30 and even 40 degrees. Ideal conditions for solar energy and scooter drivers, whom you can see on the roads in masses, unfortunately still with gasoline bikes. Most often they have old, stinky, and loud two-strike engines.
reputable calculation
We are not just some adventurers, we calculated in a very serious way the financial requirements. We also calculated some financial reserves for unexpected expenses or delivery delays, so that we can protect ourselves and your money. Especially projects concerning environmental or social protection very often are not well pre-calculated because the main causes are not simply the amount of money and but this is exactly why many of them have not the expected success in the long term.
Our project is different in that we will already have covered all expenses at the time when the first 100 electric scooters are rented, and that is a target we expect to fulfil within 2 or 3 months. As a matter of fact, we already have 15 orders. And still, we calculated for the whole first year all the expenses taking in consideration our needs such as the rent for the location/office, staff etc. At the end of the fifth year we intend to have rented out about 5000 scooters, that’s on average 1 of 1000 Athenians. That’s not a very demanding target but quite the opposite, it’s a really restrained target. To be honest, I expect a much bigger success than just 5000 electric scooters in the streets of Athens.

<p><b>Right Folks, the Flags are here, and distribution to individual donors and group donors is underway. Please be patient while we get everything organised.</b></p>
<p><b>Some of you will undoubtedly get your flags quicker than others but be assured they are on their way. </b></p>
<p><b>Thanks again to everyone who made this possible. </b></p>
<p><b>Lets get Scotland Yessed!</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b><br/></p>
<p>All extra funds will be spent on Yes Scotland merchandise.  Thanks for your patience. Please remember there will be opportunities to get these from Newsnet Scotland, Yes Scotland and numerous local Yes groups. Do not panic people.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A small team of
people have brought this project this far. We have designed, fronted
the manufacturers deposit, and already started production for 10 thousand of these Saltires,
7.5k with black Yes and 2.5k in the more subtle grey. <br/></p>
<p>The split is broadly in line
with the limited but influential market research we undertook.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>You can see the
two graphics here and we will have photos of physical examples of
these flags within a few days. They are 5'x3' (1.52x0.91m) polyester,
seemed and eyeletted flags, just as you'd find at any event, or
tartan shop in the country.</p>

<h2>What we're
asking for. 
</h2>
<p>
</p>
<p>We will offer a
free flag, colour of your choice, to everyone who donates £5 or more to the campaign
(the usual retail price).  We can offer better deals to larger
contributors IF they can realistically distribute themselves.</p>
<p>We have already had one large contribution to assist in the transfer of the manufacturers deposit. We anticipate this will more or less balance the distribution costs we have once the flags are here, hence the appeal total staying at £9400.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p> We anticipate
a mix of free and charged for distribution to reach the maximum number
of people and still create extra revenue for local campaign groups as well.</p>
<p>The flags will
be available at the end of May, ideal timing for the summer ahead.</p>
<p>Our flexible funding choice, and completion date of 25th April is because we need funds at this date. If we have our target great, but even if we don't we will require what is available to pay and ship the flags. WE will then have one month to find additional funds to clear the goods here. <br/></p>
<h3>Our target is
an ambitious but very worthwhile £9400.</h3>
<p>This covers the
Indiegogo expenses and distribution costs for delivering the flags to fundraisers and groups alike.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>So please folks
if you believe, like we do that this can be the
'Summer of Yes' donate what you can and let's get this done!</h3>
<h3>Please share and retweet this campaign and help us really 'Yes' Scotland this summer!</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>(*Please note
it is totally feasible to replicate this move for small car flags.At this early stage if a backer was found they could be
shipped together. Costs would would be around two thirds  of the
large flag price.)</p>

</div></div>","Right Folks, the Flags are here, and distribution to individual donors and group donors is underway. Please be patient while we get everything organised.
Some of you will undoubtedly get your flags quicker than others but be assured they are on their way. 
Thanks again to everyone who made this possible. 
Lets get Scotland Yessed!

All extra funds will be spent on Yes Scotland merchandise.  Thanks for your patience. Please remember there will be opportunities to get these from Newsnet Scotland, Yes Scotland and numerous local Yes groups. Do not panic people.


A small team of
people have brought this project this far. We have designed, fronted
the manufacturers deposit, and already started production for 10 thousand of these Saltires,
7.5k with black Yes and 2.5k in the more subtle grey. 
The split is broadly in line
with the limited but influential market research we undertook.


You can see the
two graphics here and we will have photos of physical examples of
these flags within a few days. They are 5'x3' (1.52x0.91m) polyester,
seemed and eyeletted flags, just as you'd find at any event, or
tartan shop in the country.




We can land these
flags in Scotland for a price of £9000,or 90p each!





They usually retail between £5-8.This is a closely educated guess as my own business background partly involves
the importing of similar type goods from the far east. As such
all logistics are carried out by existing contacts and should be relatively straight forward.

Thanks for that.</h3> <p>Two years ago we made a start in modernising pigeon racing in the Netherlands. For that we set up digital ""revolutions"" based on the electronic timing systems used nowadays. That was not enought to us. Most systems are based on electronics out of the 90's and have never been developed after that. Extra devices make it possible to connect to the internet, but the used devices can't re-connect. <br/></p>
<p>Extra outraged costs for battery change and updates make the old fashion electronic systems ready to be replaced by techniques which are available as we speak.</p>
<p>Main goal is to get every pigeons fancier all over the world to be connected to the new system which is webbased. Arrivals straigt on the internet to our dbase. Live results on every occasion, even in training modus. A world wide network to be set up which is actually the backbone of this system.</p>
<p>This project is about building the prototype of a webbased clocking system based, but certainly not limited, on the FCI regulations for ETS. <br/></p>
<p>Most important is the pricing for this webbased online clocking system. It needs to be affordabel for every pigeon fancier around the world. One sport - One system - Reasonable pricing for everyone.</p>
<p>What is the reasonable price:</p>
<p>Thats easier said then done, because it all depends on howmany will be pre-ordered. In fact there is no need to make big profits out of it. The more fanciers pre-order the cheaper it gets.</p>
<p>Yearly fee for keeping the backbone up and running and maintaining for the best performance will be depending on participation as well, but never exceeds € 3,- per month. Our goal is to bring this fee up to € 1-- per month, but again it depends on pre-orders. At the end of the day it is a system for the pigeon fanciers community world wide. <br/></p>
<p>A pre-order form will be ready soon and published on the internet.<br/></p>
<br/>What We Need &amp; What You Get:<br/><br/>For building this online clocking system prototype and first setup of the backbone system we need 25000 euro. For that the prototype of the electronic timing system can be made, implemented in the backbone and tested by FCI. This system can be installed and never touched again. There is no need to bring your system to the basketting centre because there is already one there which is connected to the backbone.<br/><br/>All systems are connected to the backbone. The servers in the backbone ""know"" every timing system connected to the backbone and run programs and store all the races planned. The basketting centre log in on a specific upcoming race. The participating pigeons will be registrered for this particular race in the basketting centre. You just only bring the pigeons, that's it. After basketting you are ready to report your pigeons after liberation with your (permanent) installed onling timing system. You, as a fancier, just take care of your pigeons. The system does all the rest. <br/>Even when your network connection is off air for some reason, this online timing system will report your arrival as soon the network connection is re-established. The arrival date and time will be stored in the device memory.<br/><br/>The server generates live results on the web for every race. For you and your club it is easy to watch the arrivals in every race going on at that particular time. There is no need to re-calculate every report because the system has already done that for you.<br/><br/>The funds will be used to have the right engineers on the right spot to develop, test and implement the webbased electronic timing system. Check out our perks for the rewards we give away for your support<br/>
</div><br/><div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Your contribution as the final introduction will have a great impact on world wide pigeon racing. Everyone will use the same system. Everyone can be connected. Live results and monitoring of every race in the world. It will become a great sport to be followed by fanciers and friends and other interested parties.<br/></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Are there any risks in participating. No, because if we don't reach our goal your money we be send back to you.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Pat Lynn. I broke my neck and was completely paralyzed on July 4, 2009. Doctors originally said that I would never walk again or use my hands, but my faith has always told me differently. Today I can walk with a walker and spend most of my time on my bike or at physical therapy. I am also a part-time teacher at Life Christian School in Tacoma, WA and I speak at assemblies and do fundraisers to support people living with severe medical conditions like mine. I would like to ride my bike across America as a fundraiser and need your help to do it!</p>
<p><strong>What I Need </strong></p>
<p>I split my fundraising project into three phases:</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Phase 1</span>- $2,000 for electric assist motor, $500 for bicycle trailer, $1,000 for modifications to my bike so that I can stand up when we are on trips as well as costs of setting up my bike correctly.</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Phase 2</span>- Winter 2014 cost of a support vehicle</p>
<p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Phase 3</span>- Travel expenses</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Since I have recovered from my accident, I have shared my story with thousands of people. In 2011, I raised $15,000 that all went to support people living with spinal cord injuries. Last year, I spoke to over 2,500 middle and high school students and taught about overcoming what is seemingly impossible. I would like to impact as many people across the country as I can by sharing what I have and helping them to have victories with their personal struggles.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Please watch my video and share it with as many friends and people that you can.</li>
<li>If you are a school administrator, pastor or other community representative, you can contact me about sharing my story in your community.</li>

Today I can walk with a walker and spend most of my time on my bike or at physical therapy. I am also a part-time teacher at Life Christian School in Tacoma, WA and I speak at assemblies and do fundraisers to support people living with severe medical conditions like mine. I would like to ride my bike across America as a fundraiser and need your help to do it!
What I Need 
I split my fundraising project into three phases:
Phase 1- $2,000 for electric assist motor, $500 for bicycle trailer, $1,000 for modifications to my bike so that I can stand up when we are on trips as well as costs of setting up my bike correctly.
Phase 2- Winter 2014 cost of a support vehicle
Phase 3- Travel expenses
 
The Impact
Since I have recovered from my accident, I have shared my story with thousands of people. In 2011, I raised $15,000 that all went to support people living with spinal cord injuries. Last year, I spoke to over 2,500 middle and high school students and taught about overcoming what is seemingly impossible. I would like to impact as many people across the country as I can by sharing what I have and helping them to have victories with their personal struggles.
 
Other Ways You Can Help

Please watch my video and share it with as many friends and people that you can.
If you are a school administrator, pastor or other community representative, you can contact me about sharing my story in your community.
If you would like to know more about my story, you can watch these links of my recovery from the last four years.

On the flats, riders can choose to take advantage of extra power to battle headwinds or maintain speeds of up to 28 m.p.h. with ease, or with the push of a button, switch to pedal-only mode and maximize your ride time while enjoying the lightweight efficiency and the effective 27-speed drive-train.</p><p>One of the key features of this bike is the revolutionary mid drive motor that allows the power to be applied where need it most: the pedals.

<p>This is the mid drive everyone's been waiting for. With the Bafang M500 motor that delivers 26% more torque than the Bosch mid drive, plus hydraulic disc brakes, premium Gates CDX carbon belt drive and a Samsung battery hidden in the downtube, all wrapped up in a smooth welded, hand polished frame.

<p>After our successful Kickstarter campaign we were invited by Indiegogo to take part in their InDemand program for greater exposure of our project. We had always planned to produce far more Miller ebikes than we would expect to sell on any crowdfunding platform, but allowing people to take part in our pre-order would mean they could reserve a bike in advance and receive a generous discount, and we could increase our numbers and subsequent buying power with suppliers.

</div></div>","The Miller electric bicycle by Enki Cycles is setting the global standard for e-bikes. Legal everywhere electric bikes are including The UK, Europe, Australia and the USA, it will redefine the way you commute with all of the fun and none of the sweat.
 



 
Miller is for the traffic haters. The lycra disdainers. The freedom lovers. The people who don’t want to start their day pushed into someone else’s arm pit. For anyone who likes to go anywhere, without any sweat. If you know how to ride a bike, Miller is for you.
 

 
 

 
This is the mid drive everyone's been waiting for. With the Bafang M500 motor that delivers 26% more torque than the Bosch mid drive, plus hydraulic disc brakes, premium Gates CDX carbon belt drive and a Samsung battery hidden in the downtube, all wrapped up in a smooth welded, hand polished frame. It's more than just an ebike with premium components at half the price, it's downright beautiful.
 

*Prototype pictured. Production model may differ slightly.
 

 
POWERFUL - The Bafang M500 delivers 95Nm of torque and weighs only 3.3kg - this is 26% more torque and 17% lighter than the Bosch Performance Line mid drive. 
SILENT - The Gates CDX Carbon Belt drive is Gates' premium offering and comes with a 30000km warranty.
SLEEK - Miller's Premium Samsung battery is hidden within the frame, ensuring protection all year round.
SELF ASSURED - Hydraulic disc brakes with internally routed cabling ensure you stop on a dime.
CONFIDENT - With a range of 70KM / 44MI, you can move confidently wherever you need to go, with all of the fun and none of the sweat.
FEATHER-LIGHT - At just 15.5KG / 34.2LBS, Miller is both ridden and carried easily wherever you need.
 

 

 

 
Simply  put, you won't find another electric bike on the market that is as sleek, or has the same quality components and workmanship as Miller, even if you pay double the price.
 

 
 

 
After our successful Kickstarter campaign we were invited by Indiegogo to take part in their InDemand program for greater exposure of our project. We had always planned to produce far more Miller ebikes than we would expect to sell on any crowdfunding platform, but allowing people to take part in our pre-order would mean they could reserve a bike in advance and receive a generous discount, and we could increase our numbers and subsequent buying power with suppliers. This buying power would mean a chance to upgrade components - a true win-win for all.

<p>To all the amazing supporters out there, we have reached a point where the
private sector of small businesses needs to start pitching in where the
government is failing. It may not be the most profitable decision, but the
bigger picture is helping the smaller communities thrive.. benefits everyone in
the long run.</p>
<p>My name is Matt Houser and my mission is to raise enough money to duplicate
the work transportation program I created in Michigan and expand
it in South Carolina. The concept is simple, we help people with
transportation issues get back into the work force and hopefully stop
using the excuse that they can’t get a job because they don't have a car.</p>
<p> I am trying to raise $10,000 toward the purchase (or donation) of 2
vehicles for the launch of a new work Fresh Start Work Transportation Program.</p>
<p>Here is a little background on the concept. I started
this project just over 4 years ago with one vehicle and a
burning desire to create a program that was beneficial to my
community.</p>
<p>When I moved to Michigan, I quickly realized just how bad private
transportation was needed. I did my research and found that there was a 50
mile gap between Kalamazoo and Grand Rapids with no taxis or city
transportation anywhere in between.  After doing more research, I found
that the biggest obstacle in finding gainful employment for people
in those areas was establishing reliable transportation. It
seemed like everyone I met had the same reason for not working!! They
can’t get a car because they don't have a job, and they don't have a job
because they can’t afford a car. The temp agencies and the government programs
in the surrounding areas also have trouble placing people in jobs because
the transportation issues.</p>
<p> So I decided that I would make it my mission to focus on helping these
communities get to and from work with reliable and affordable transportation.
The first thing I did was reach out to the local temp agencies to see how I
could be of service to them. Then I wrote a proposal for Michigan
Works (Job Placement Program) to see if they could benefit from my
services and business really took off from there. My first year with the
program was busier than I ever expected.  So busy in fact that I
had to purchase additional vehicles to help support the local market
that was calling on my services.</p>
<p>Now that I have established a working model in Michigan, I would like
to start helping other smaller communities that struggle with the same issues,
however, raising capital for the vehicles is one of the biggest
obstacles I face being a for profit business, along with my personal line of credit being maxed out with 3 open
vehicle loans. </p>
<p> Once the program is up and running it has proven to be self-sustaining
and a big asset to the community. It can change the lives of the people who use
the services by putting cash back in their hands to support their families and
their communities.</p>
<p>Here is the breakdown of expenses. I will be covering all expenses that
exceed the 10k I’m trying to raise.</p>
<p>2 vehicles @$5,000 each</p>
<p>Tax title registration $250 each</p>
<p>Licensing, inspections and regulatory fees $200 each vehicle.</p>
<p>The commercial insurance states that I have to have ""mandatory 1
million of liability"", which will cost $2950 per year per vehicle.</p>
<p>Advertisement is minimal as I will be personally sitting down with the local
agencies to establish accounts and then they would pass the information to
their clients. Minimal print and internet ads will cost $500 per 6 months.</p>
<p>In the event that we don’t raise enough money to launch 2 vehicles, I will
start with just one and work from there. Thank you for taking the time to look
at my proposal! I hope one year from now you will see more people in other
communities taking advantage of these services as we hope to expand with
the demand of more transportation needs. </p>

Now, I want to share with you the real raw reasons why this service is so important.</p><p>I ask you to take a moment and go over your activities over just this week alone in your head. Now think about how many times you jumped in your vehicle and ran to the market or convenience store because you had a craving for something and you just had to have it. How many times did you run out to meet up with a friend for coffee or drinks? Did you have to run out and grab a carton of half &amp; half for your morning coffee that you forgot to pick up yesterday? Did you get frustrated because you had to run errands after you went grocery shopping and you kept thinking about how your ice cream was melting away, minute by excruciating minute you could almost hear it drip, drip, drip, drip, while the fool in the hot rod in front of you was poking along at a snails pace? How about running to your doctors office on a long lunch break to address that pesky ear ache you have had for the last week?</p><p>Now imagine making an appointment ""no more than 5 days in advance"" (this is an actual rule from a large transportation provider in my area and is a direct result of the influx of people with disabilities in the system after the closing of HGA) for a ride on one of the wheelchair/handicap vans that are run by a very large for profit transportation provider in your area to go grocery shopping. Imagine sitting on a van that drove around picking up passenger after passenger and dropping them off at locations that were geographically closer than your destination. Yep, you made an ""appointment"" to have transportation to the grocery store, but that only means that the behemoth transportation provider is going to pick you up right around the time that you asked for. That doesn't mean that you will get to your destination at that time. You arrive at the grocery store and your trip was a little longer than you expected, now you only have 45 minutes to get all your groceries and meet the handicap van at the entrance because you have to book a return trip in advance also, they don't wait and then you pile all your groceries in, and keep them safe from the foot traffic that will be getting on &amp; off the van. You start praying that today is a slow day and you get home within an hour or so with your groceries intact. Not today, everybody within a 10 mile radius of you needed to go out today too. </p><p>Now can you hear it, drip, drip, drip??</p><p>Think about this for a minute. Everyday you go to work and the people you work with are close friends. You swap stories, share your lunch break, maybe you talk about your kids and show pictures of them to as many people as will look at them . You grab a bite to eat and a cocktail after work. You plan a weekend to go shopping and catch a movie. These are things that happen in peoples lives everyday. Then, one day you are told that your work is closing on Monday. You have no job, no place to go and now you will lose all the friends you have made in your co-workers. They will all be going to other companies all over the state. You even have to move in order to continue to have a place to lay your head. Now after you find a new job you now have to make new friends and hope that this place is as nice as the last one, that the people treat you kindly and you make new friends and your contribution is valued.</p><p>This is what happened recently in Western Massachusetts. Holyoke Geriatrics closed their doors due to ""mismanagement"" of money. We know what that means don't we? One dollar for you and two for me. 80 people that called the adult day healthcare program also known as adult daycare their ""work"" or their home away from home lost the only place they had to lead a relatively ""normal"" or similar life to that of an able bodied person.</p><p>Not to mention the residential services it provided also known as a nursing home. So many people moved to other facilities near AND far. New streets to learn, new bus routes, new doctors, new stores, new day programs, new senior centers. </p><p>The one constant in all these scenarios is that people that are physically handicapped and/or developmentally impaired need consistent, reliable, and individually tailored transportation. </p><p>I ask that you please help me provide that. Please help our friends, families, neighbors and community members live their lives too. Please donate to this campaign so that I, with the help of my community can make these peoples lives a little easier. These people suffer enough, let's do what we can to help. </p><p><br/></p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read this. Please donate to this start up non-profit endeavor and plesae share.</p><p>We can't do this without you.</p><p>Warm regards,</p><p>Deana<br/></p></div>","Hello,I gave you the hard research and all the fundamental information you could ever want about the need for handicap accessible transportation in my initial appeal for this campaign.

You arrive at the grocery store and your trip was a little longer than you expected, now you only have 45 minutes to get all your groceries and meet the handicap van at the entrance because you have to book a return trip in advance also, they don't wait and then you pile all your groceries in, and keep them safe from the foot traffic that will be getting on & off the van. You start praying that today is a slow day and you get home within an hour or so with your groceries intact. Not today, everybody within a 10 mile radius of you needed to go out today too. Now can you hear it, drip, drip, drip??Think about this for a minute. Everyday you go to work and the people you work with are close friends. You swap stories, share your lunch break, maybe you talk about your kids and show pictures of them to as many people as will look at them . You grab a bite to eat and a cocktail after work. You plan a weekend to go shopping and catch a movie. These are things that happen in peoples lives everyday. Then, one day you are told that your work is closing on Monday. You have no job, no place to go and now you will lose all the friends you have made in your co-workers. They will all be going to other companies all over the state. You even have to move in order to continue to have a place to lay your head. Now after you find a new job you now have to make new friends and hope that this place is as nice as the last one, that the people treat you kindly and you make new friends and your contribution is valued.This is what happened recently in Western Massachusetts. Holyoke Geriatrics closed their doors due to ""mismanagement"" of money. We know what that means don't we? One dollar for you and two for me. 80 people that called the adult day healthcare program also known as adult daycare their ""work"" or their home away from home lost the only place they had to lead a relatively ""normal"" or similar life to that of an able bodied person.Not to mention the residential services it provided also known as a nursing home. So many people moved to other facilities near AND far. New streets to learn, new bus routes, new doctors, new stores, new day programs, new senior centers. The one constant in all these scenarios is that people that are physically handicapped and/or developmentally impaired need consistent, reliable, and individually tailored transportation. I ask that you please help me provide that. Please help our friends, families, neighbors and community members live their lives too. Please donate to this campaign so that I, with the help of my community can make these peoples lives a little easier. These people suffer enough, let's do what we can to help. Thank you for taking the time to read this. Please donate to this start up non-profit endeavor and plesae share.We can't do this without you.Warm regards,Deana",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","Hello.
We are Texas Guadaloop, a team of students and researchers from the University of Texas at Austin, who are building the first working Hyperloop transportation vehicle using air bearing technology.

What's the Hyperloop?
In 2013, Elon Musk released a white paper discussing a new mode of transportation called the Hyperloop that would transport people and cargo from major city to major city in 20-30 minutes. By levitating a pod on a bed of air and propelling it through a partially evacuated tube, speeds of up to 700mph can be reached. It's as fast as a plane, but still as convenient to ride as a train.

This is crazy. Could this really work?
There is no doubt a Hyperloop will be built. Hyperloop One conducted their first full-scale test in vacuum a year ago, and several other Hyperloop companies have raised millions to build transport systems in South Korea, Dubai, and Europe.
In 2015, SpaceX announced an international competition for student teams to design and build a working prototype pod to compete on a one-mile test track that SpaceX has built at their HQ in Hawthorne. The first few teams hit the track in January, and Texas Guadaloop was one of 22 teams left competing on the track last August. This year we're coming for more. We're preparing yet another pod to go compete this July. Our team has worked tirelessly these past three years to create a cost-effective and energy-efficient solution to make the Hyperloop a reality.
Air Bearings.
Elon's original idea for the Hyperloop was to use air-bearings to levitate in a frictionless environment. Imagine an air hockey table, but where air comes out of the puck instead of the table. Since the SpaceX-Hyperloop competition was announced, there has been no team or company to test the viability of air bearings at high speeds.
We are one of the first teams in the world who are building an air bearing pod and are preparing to test it at high velocities on the SpaceX-Hyperloop test track. The implications for transportation fueled off of air are groundbreaking and have the power to disrupt the transportation industry. 

Why not MagLev?
MagLev utilizes magnets to levitate the pod whereas air-bearings utilize pressurized air. MagLev is a proven technology and has no doubt been tested thoroughly,  but the advantages of utilizing air-bearings are enormous. Air-bearings do not need to hit a specific speed to levitate and they do not exhibit drag. This means we could use air bearings for shorter distances and destinations without costly expenditures of MagLev. There is a reason why MagLev trains haven't popped up in America. Imagine putting them in a more expensive vacuum tube.
Will the Hyperloop really become the world's next major mode of transportation?
The prototype we are building for the Hyperloop can support thousands of pounds at a fraction of cost and energy. Building a full-scale system has the potential to make goods and supplies flow more efficiently than current methods. Additional highways and cars won't solve traffic problems, but a Hyperloop can let you work in one city and live in another. Texas Guadaloop wants to be the team to bring Hyperloop to Texas.

<h2>Go faster with the Chameleon Turbo ebike!</h2>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The Chameleon scooter by Daymak is the SMARTEST, safest electric bicycle that is adaptable to everyone's unique needs. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">
</span></p>
<p>Ebikes
can be ridden on the roads without insurance or a license if they feature a 500W motor (in some states 750W) and they have pedals. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Most
ebikes and scooters that fit into this category are either too weak, have very few
features, or are extremely expensive.</span></p>
<p>That's what makes Chameleon the best ebike on the market. We've succeeded in building a fully loaded scooter with great features at an
affordable price, all while reducing CO2 emissions!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>After over 13 years of selling ebikes we've come up with features that will satisfy everyone's safety, speed, range, torque, and customization needs.</p>
<p>We achieved these goals through:</p>
<p>+Bluetooth
controller </p>
<p>+84V
battery pack </p>
<p>+Smart
Solar  case with integrated +RGB LED lights</p>
<p>Let's
look at these features in detail.</p>
<br/><p></p>
</div>
</div><div>
<p>
</p>
<blockquote style=""text-align: right;"">It is possible for the Chameleon to reach speeds of  60km/h  (37 mph.) It is the responsibility of the rider to set the speed  based on local laws.</blockquote>
<p></p>
<h2>BLUETOOTH CONTROLLER</h2>
<p>The Daymak Drive Bluetooth controller with My Ebike App: Our software can run on Android OS. Let's face - it we're not all the same. We ride in different places, and everyone is not the same weight. Our controller lets the user define what they need to accommodate variations in height, weight, and road incline. The rider can adjust torque (for climbing steep inclines), speed, and select eco mode (for longer range). Riders can also  lock the motor (for anti-theft control), turbo on for maximum torque power, off road mode to on trails and dirt roads  and we are working on a few more functions that we are now finalizing during this campaign.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>No Smartphone? No Problem?</h2> If you don't have a smartphone, you can still do customize your ebike to fit your needs. When you order your Chameleon Turbo we will ask you a few questions so that we can set the default settings to what may fit you best. However if you need to make tweaks once you receive it, you can adjust any of the settings by connecting it to a computer. Other than that, you scooter runs perfectly without it! <p></p>

<h2>Chameleon Scooter: 84V BATTERY PACK</h2>
<p>The average battery pack for an electric bicycle is 48V. Some have 60V, and a few have 72V. But we've put in an 84V battery pack. Why? To give you the possibility to increase torque and speed when necessary, and to give you longer range when the controller is set to ECO mode. </p>

<h2>SMART SOLAR CASE WITH INTEGRATED RGB LED LIGHTS</h2>
<p></p>
<div><p>The Daymak Solar Case features 3 integrated solar panels that continuously trickle charge the battery. Trickle charging the battery extends the range of the bike by 6-9 km per day. Trickle charging also negates the possibility of a dead battery, which is the number one failure in ebikes, and the most expensive part to replace. The solar case also provides storage space for groceries, books, your lunch or whatever you desire. The case is also an added safety feature: The LED lights are integrated with the brake lights and signal lights, providing a clearer picture for the drivers behind you. (One of our stretch goals is to add sensors for the brake lights to turn on automatically when the ebike slows down, and turn on the lights automatically when it gets darker.)</p></div>

</div></div>","Go faster with the Chameleon Turbo ebike!

The Chameleon scooter by Daymak is the SMARTEST, safest electric bicycle that is adaptable to everyone's unique needs. 


Ebikes
can be ridden on the roads without insurance or a license if they feature a 500W motor (in some states 750W) and they have pedals. Most
ebikes and scooters that fit into this category are either too weak, have very few
features, or are extremely expensive.
That's what makes Chameleon the best ebike on the market. We've succeeded in building a fully loaded scooter with great features at an
affordable price, all while reducing CO2 emissions!


After over 13 years of selling ebikes we've come up with features that will satisfy everyone's safety, speed, range, torque, and customization needs.
We achieved these goals through:
+Bluetooth
controller 
+84V
battery pack 
+Smart
Solar  case with integrated +RGB LED lights
Let's
look at these features in detail.





It is possible for the Chameleon to reach speeds of  60km/h  (37 mph.) It is the responsibility of the rider to set the speed  based on local laws.

BLUETOOTH CONTROLLER
The Daymak Drive Bluetooth controller with My Ebike App: Our software can run on Android OS. Let's face - it we're not all the same. We ride in different places, and everyone is not the same weight. Our controller lets the user define what they need to accommodate variations in height, weight, and road incline. The rider can adjust torque (for climbing steep inclines), speed, and select eco mode (for longer range). Riders can also  lock the motor (for anti-theft control), turbo on for maximum torque power, off road mode to on trails and dirt roads  and we are working on a few more functions that we are now finalizing during this campaign.

No Smartphone? No Problem? If you don't have a smartphone, you can still do customize your ebike to fit your needs. When you order your Chameleon Turbo we will ask you a few questions so that we can set the default settings to what may fit you best. However if you need to make tweaks once you receive it, you can adjust any of the settings by connecting it to a computer. Other than that, you scooter runs perfectly without it! 























Chameleon Scooter: 84V BATTERY PACK
The average battery pack for an electric bicycle is 48V. Some have 60V, and a few have 72V. But we've put in an 84V battery pack. Why? To give you the possibility to increase torque and speed when necessary, and to give you longer range when the controller is set to ECO mode. 







CUSTOMIZABLE RGB LED LIGHTS

The additional RGB LED light strips running from the case down the side can be modified by remote to any color the rider chooses. This creates a much more visible ebike from any angle. The enhanced visibility gives additional safety and adds unique style to the Chameleon.












SMART SOLAR CASE WITH INTEGRATED RGB LED LIGHTS

The Daymak Solar Case features 3 integrated solar panels that continuously trickle charge the battery. Trickle charging the battery extends the range of the bike by 6-9 km per day. Trickle charging also negates the possibility of a dead battery, which is the number one failure in ebikes, and the most expensive part to replace. The solar case also provides storage space for groceries, books, your lunch or whatever you desire. The case is also an added safety feature: The LED lights are integrated with the brake lights and signal lights, providing a clearer picture for the drivers behind you. (One of our stretch goals is to add sensors for the brake lights to turn on automatically when the ebike slows down, and turn on the lights automatically when it gets darker.)

<h2>Why did I start this?!</h2>
<p>Cyclists who have just had their bikes stolen, Usually are not psychologically ready to spend a lot on a new bike which is another sitting duck for the thieves. So most of the victims either stop using bicycles for a while or replace it with a used bicycle. About two year ago, I also had my bike stolen. I was not surprised, But I was mad at the thief because I had to take a bus instead of my beautiful bike. I wanted to replace my bike as soon as possible; So I went to a flea market and bought a used bike...</p>
<p>In a few days I realized that maybe I have contributed to bike crimes by buying a bike from strangers, how could i make sure that the bike was not stolen? Should I have interrogated the bike seller or should I have judged him based on his look???</p>
<p>Non of those were the solution; So I started to think to the problem and search for a solution. The results of that research sparked the idea of Cyclingboom's community.</p>
<p>I strongly believe that this project could make a difference and that's why I spent months of my time to develop a system for bike theft deterrence, along with lots of other features for cycling community.</p>
<p>Now I am here and I need your help to make it happen!</p>
<p>Thank you in advanced for your contribution.</p>
<h2>What Is This Initiative About?</h2>
<p>We don’t know the exact number of bicycle thefts, yet unofficial statistics are showing tens of millions of bike crimes/year  happening all over the world.</p>
<p>In Cycling Boom, we think that the solution to bike thefts is not bigger, heavier and stronger chains, locks and whatsoever...</p>
<p>Our conclusion is that the only way to deter bike thefts is to increase the risk of the crime and also eliminate the market for those stolen bikes.</p>
<p>Analyzing the crime, it is obvious that we have a flaw in our perception about it.</p>
<p>Its being naive to think that the bike crimes happen solely because of the existence of thieves. Its clear that most bike crimes happen because there is a market for stolen bicycles.</p>
<p>So For every bike crime there are at least 2 victims, the one who got a bike stolen and the one who is buying a stolen bike as a used bike.</p>
<p>In this pattern one gets a bike stolen, then he or she goes to a flea market or online store and buys a used-bike that is probably stolen from a another peer,  and This makes a chain and a paradigm that is infinitely repeated.We believe that cyclists wouldn’t buy stolen bikes providing that there is an easy way to distinguish them.</p>
<p>Our plan at Cycling Boom is providing an easy way to identify stolen bikes.  Along with a free registry system we offer a free metal bicycle tag made of engraved stainless steel for everyone  and also under-priced premium designs for those who want to support initiative. This enables us to register our bikes and makes it easier to track the status of the bikes in an online universal bicycle registry system.</p>
<p>By convention these tags  would be installed on the top tube or head tube, which is the most visible place on the bike.</p>
<p>Consequently we ask bicycle owners to enter the basic specification of the bike into our online database. It enables cyclists to report bicycle theft whenever it happens without loss of data and it also makes it possible for police and people who are looking for used bicycles to have a tool to check the status of the bikes by knowing the serial number.</p>
<p>We encourage everyone to check this serial number if they ever wanted to buy a second-hand bike.</p>

<h2>What We Need</h2>
<p>To Make this initiative self sustainable, we need to reduce the production costs and that is not an easy task, if we outsource engraving jobs. So we would need the production Facilities to reduce the prices and supply more and more cyclists with free and premium tags.</p>
<p>It is also important to redesign the alpha version of the website and be ready to expand the service for more people while maintaining the service in a high standard.</p>

<h2>The Impact Of Cyclingboom</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, bike crimes has influenced our cycling habits in a very bad way. Many people avoid riding their bike to work as they are afraid  their beautiful bike might get stolen.

<p>In our desired future cities, no one would stop riding bicycles because of fear for rider's safety or bikes security.</p>

What Is This Initiative About?

Our conclusion is that the only way to deter bike thefts is to increase the risk of the crime and also eliminate the market for those stolen bikes.
Analyzing the crime, it is obvious that we have a flaw in our perception about it.
Its being naive to think that the bike crimes happen solely because of the existence of thieves. Its clear that most bike crimes happen because there is a market for stolen bicycles.
So For every bike crime there are at least 2 victims, the one who got a bike stolen and the one who is buying a stolen bike as a used bike.
In this pattern one gets a bike stolen, then he or she goes to a flea market or online store and buys a used-bike that is probably stolen from a another peer,  and This makes a chain and a paradigm that is infinitely repeated.We believe that cyclists wouldn’t buy stolen bikes providing that there is an easy way to distinguish them.

By the time the European tour was over his new band was the real deal ready to take on the UK and then the USA. Just four short years later in 1976 what started on the bus, James Paul McCartney's 'Bond' mission with his new musical mates, culminated in him writing and performing his way back to the pinnacle of stadium rock acts. Sir Paul McCartney is a national treasure. The most successful, biggest selling singer-songwriter performer ever.</p><p>Paul McCartney gave WNO 481 its Wings. For two months in 1972 WNO 481 was the most famous bus in the world. Down the years many books, videos and articles have documented Paul McCartney, Wings and WNO 481. 48 years after that 1972 tour a recent video of the bus on its Facebook page achieved over 25,000 views. WNO 481's Facebook page has 2,928 registered Followers with many thousands of Likes, Loves, Wow's, Hugs etc. for its many posts, photos and videos. If you Google 'WNO 481' or '1972 Wings Tour Bus' you will get some idea of its very full history. It is probably still the most famous bus in the world.<br/><br/>WNO 481 needs restoration following years of neglect, quietly forgotten in a dusty ravine in Tenerife.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1597773092/ubecgihzb32umb9qpr43.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Our goal is to bring the bus back to its glorious best.

By the time the European tour was over his new band was the real deal ready to take on the UK and then the USA. Just four short years later in 1976 what started on the bus, James Paul McCartney's 'Bond' mission with his new musical mates, culminated in him writing and performing his way back to the pinnacle of stadium rock acts. Sir Paul McCartney is a national treasure. The most successful, biggest selling singer-songwriter performer ever.Paul McCartney gave WNO 481 its Wings. For two months in 1972 WNO 481 was the most famous bus in the world. Down the years many books, videos and articles have documented Paul McCartney, Wings and WNO 481. 48 years after that 1972 tour a recent video of the bus on its Facebook page achieved over 25,000 views. WNO 481's Facebook page has 2,928 registered Followers with many thousands of Likes, Loves, Wow's, Hugs etc. for its many posts, photos and videos. If you Google 'WNO 481' or '1972 Wings Tour Bus' you will get some idea of its very full history. It is probably still the most famous bus in the world.WNO 481 needs restoration following years of neglect, quietly forgotten in a dusty ravine in Tenerife.Our goal is to bring the bus back to its glorious best. Representing 67 years of classically beautiful automotive ‘transport of the people’ design heritage and approaching 50 years of rock and roll art and history on wheels.This is how it will look when restored. WNO 481 is a living, mobile museum on wheels patiently waiting to be restored to delight the people, the fans and future charitable fundraisers. The bus is back in the UK and restorers are ready and waiting to work extra hard to put it back on the road but we need your help.

<p><span>MATE is brought to you from Denmark with love by brother and sister team Christian Adel Michael and Julie Kronstrøm Carton. </span></p>

<p><b>Christian Adel Michael, 29</b></p>
<p>Christian is a natural born entrepreneur with years of experience in the manufacturing industry.</p>
<p>With close relationships to factories across the world, he has organised the production and distribution of products within tight deadlines. Together with Julie, they run a company that distributes and sells consumer goods all over Northern Europe. Last Christmas they produced and delivered 10,000 electric hair-brushes across Scandinavia within 2 months.</p>
<p>MATE is the result of his long term passion for design, technology and innovative mobility solutions. After gaining success with a ladies eBike in 2014, Christian decided to reboot the project from the ground up, and so MATE was born. His experience with manufacturing, import and logistics is a vital asset for this project - making sure that you will get a great MATE. He knows how to tackle obstacles and turn challenges into opportunities.</p>
<p><b>Julie Kronstrøm Carton, 39 </b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Julie is a business and project development expert and quintessential problem solver. She is the driving force behind the high level of service and assistance you will receive from the MATE team. As a mother of 3 boys and avid biker, she believes the world would be a better place with more people biking daily. Her hope is that MATE can make it a reality.</span></p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><i><b>Q:The price is very low for an e-bike. Why is that?</b></i></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A: <span>Our dream is to make cycling accessible to everyone. We have worked long and hard to create an eBike that is not only affordable, but also made of quality components; a quality eBike that is made to last you through the years.</span></span></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b><i><b>Q: How can you ensure such a low price?</b></i></b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A: <span>We have extensive experience in sourcing and manufacturing products and components. This is a key factor that enables us to maintain a low units cost based on volume. With increased sales and production volume, we are confident that we can ensure a low price, even after the campaign has ended.</span></span></p>
<p style=""font-weight: normal;""><b><b><i><b>Q: How is MATE manufactured?</b></i></b></b></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A: <span>We have spent lots of time finding the right suppliers and manufacturers for MATE. Our many years experience dealing directly with sourcing companies, factories and shipping companies have helped us a great deal to be able to offer high quality product for the lowest price possible.</span></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><span>Crowdfunding helps us to keep the costs down as we can work together with the factory to produce the right amount of units, without dealing with high storage costs and other related costs.</span></span><br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><i><b>Q: Can i order MATE S even though I do not live in US? </b></i><br/>We deliver MATE S anywhere in the world as long as local laws permits us to import Mate</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><i>NB: It is not legal to drive MATE S on public roads in the EU. You are allowed to own it and drive it on private property.</i></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><i>NB: We have not obtained an import permit for MATE S in Australia. We advise Australian backers to get a MATE City + with a booster upgrade to get a more battery power. </i><br/><br/><i><b>Q: How much weight can MATE handle? </b></i></span></p>
<p>A: MATE is build strong and can handle riders up to 125 kg with ease. </p>
<p><i><b><i><b>Q: Doest MATE come in different sizes? </b></i></b></i></p>
<p>A: MATE is designed to fit all Meaning that the seat height and front handle can be adjusted according to your needs. So whether you are 150 cm / 4'9'' or over 200 cm / 6'5'' high, you will ride comfortably at your own style.</p>
<p><i><b><i><b>Q: I can't see the battery - where is it? </b></i></b></i></p>
<p>A: B<span>atteries are not something you should be spending your time looking at - so it is well hidden in within the middle frame, protected by a locking mechanism. </span><b style=""font-weight: bold;""> </b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><i><b>Q: How much does MATE weight?</b></i></b></p>
<p>A: <span>MATE City weighs approximately 19 kg (42 lbs) without the battery and 21,5 kgs with the battery. MATE City+ weighs approximately 19 kg (42 lbs) without the battery and 22,5 kgs with the battery. MATE S weighs approximately 20,2 kg (44 lbs) without the battery and 23,7 kgs with the battery. <span>But it's carrying handle in the middle of the frame makes it easy to lift.</span></span></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><b><i><b>Q: How long does the MATE battery last?</b></i></b></b></p>
<p>A: <span>The battery inside MATE City is built to last on average up to 50 km (30 mi) with the pedal assist. With the upgraded battery found in MATE City+ and MATE S, you can get up to 80 km (55 mi). The battery takes around 5-6 hours charge or 2-4 hours with the added speed charger perk. </span> </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><b><b><i><b>Q: Can I still bike on MATE if the battery runs out of power?</b></i></b></b></b></p>
<p>A: <span>Of course! If you run out of power, you can cycle as you would do with a regular bicycle. Even without an engine - it still feels like a dream to ride.</span></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><b><b><i><b>Q: Can I charge the battery by pedalling?</b></i></b></b></b></p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">A: </b><span>At the moment, MATE primarily gets its power from the charger that is provided with the bike upon purchase. However, this is a feature we are currently looking into. </span></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><b><i><b>Q: Can the battery be removed?</b></i></b></b></p>
<p>A: Yes. <span>The battery is designed in such a way that you can change it or replace with 2 easy steps that takes less than a minute. Simply fold the middle frame, pull out the battery and you’re done.</span><b style=""font-weight: bold;""> </b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><b><b><i><b>Q: How is MATE delivered and is it easy to assemble?</b></i></b></b></b></p>
<p>A: <span>MATE comes delivered with instructions in safely packed box and requires minimal assembly. You can also find help on our extensive <a href=""https://matesupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">helpdesk</a> </span></p>
<p><span>However, if you don't have much experience with bikes, <strong>we recommend that you visit your local bike shop to get all parts tightened and thoroughly checked</strong>. </span><b style=""font-weight: bold;""> </b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><b><b><i><b>Q: How much does shipping cost?</b></i></b></b></b></p>
<p><span>A: Shipping is set to $200 to $300 USD (depending on your destination) due to the fact that we ship worldwide directly from our assembly in China. It is also one of the reasons MATEs price is so low, as there are no intermediary between you and the factory #MATEaffordable</span>.<br/><br/><b><b><b><i><b>Q: I live in Denmark, can I pick it up myself? </b></i></b></b></b></p>
<p>No. MATE eBike is ordered in bulk and will be shipping to individuals directly from our assembly in China, and to a regional commercial warehouse that is not setup for walk-in or local pickup.<br/>All MATEs will be shipped via ground shipping to the address on file. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><b><b><i><b>Q: What kind of warranty do you offer?  </b></i></b></b></b></p>
<p>A: <span>All MATE bikes and batteries come with a 2 year manufacturer's warranty. Should you encounter some production related default in that timeframe, we will simply contact our customer support and we will take care of it. As many elements of a bike may get damaged due to normal cycling use, we do not offer warranty on parts such as tires, disc brakes, chain et</span>c.<br/><br/><b style=""font-style: italic;"">Q: What is your returns-policy?</b><br/>This is the ""MATE-promise"": We are so confident that you will love your new MATE so much, that we offer you a 14 days money back guarantee after you have received it, if you are not satisfied. <br/>However, if you decide to do so, your MATE bike must be in new and re-sellable condition. #MATEpromise</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><b><b><i><b>Q: <span>What kind of accessories do you currently have or can I expect in the near future?</span></b></i></b></b></b></p>
<p>A: <span>We currently offer an more powerful battery as upgrade for MATE City+ and MATE S only, or as spare battery , but are regularly working to develop more accessories and modifications. Stay tuned for more information. Feel free to <a href=""mailto:hello@mate.bike"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">let us know</a> what kind of accessories you’d be most interested in seeing</span>.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><b><b><i><b>Q: What about spare parts? Can any bike shop assist me?</b></i></b></b></b></p>
<p>A: <span>The MATE battery is custom built for our frame and spare batteries will be able to buy from us. The rest of the components are fairly standard, meaning that you can upgrade/customise your bike as you desire with other parts either from us or your local bike shop</span>. <br/><br/><b><b><b><i><b>Q: Is it really true I can get up to 100 miles on a single charge with ""BOOSTER""? </b></i></b></b></b><br/>In perfect conditions and in ECO+ mode = Assist level 1 this can be done - but in general milage is depending on power-assist setting, terrain, total bike/rider weight and weather conditions. <br/>On ""BOOSTER"" battery, you can get anywhere between 20-100 miles, depending on your riding style. For maximum range, please use the pedals when in steep situations and when accelerating. <br/>**All MILES/KILOMETERS listed on Indiegogo are ""UP TO"" and not guaranteed.**</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><b><b><i><b>Q: Do I need a licence to ride MATE?</b></i></b></b></b></p>
<p>A: <span style=""background-color: initial;"">No. Our bikes are made 100% street legal. We offer two distinctive versions of MATE: MATE City / City+, with a 250W motor which is legal in the EU, and MATE S, with a 350W motor for the US.</span><br/><br/>MATE City and MATE City+, with its 250W motor, is by default limited according to EN15194 to the top speed of 25 km/h (15,5 mph). This means that the motor will only help you up to 25km/h. MATE S, with its 350W motor, is limited to 20 mph (32 km/h), which is the legal limit in US. It will be possible to change these settings with some reprogramming which we will make available after the campaign through MATE.community.  <br/><br/><i><b>Q: Who is responsible for any additional taxes, duties or VAT/GST?</b></i></p>

What we need
Our goal is to make bikes the transport of choice for people across the globe. And we believe MATE can help us reach that goal - an affordable, versatile eBike that is fun to ride.Biking is fun, convenient, good for both your health and the environment.. also something we are deeply passionate about.We’ve put a lot of work into making the perfect MATE. We’ve got our prototypes ready and with the support from our early backers from the campaign, we can now go into production and share it with the world. The final version of MATE is better, stronger and cooler than ever. The more we sell, the more affordable we can make MATE in the future, which is our ultimate goalThis is a strictly limited offer as a reward for those who support our vision and product.All campaign supporters will also become MATE VIPs and are entitled to exclusive early bird offers and discounts on future accessories.All campaign supporters will also become MATE VIPs and are entitled to exclusive early bird offers and discounts on future accessories. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The MATE manifestoTo us, cycling is more than a hobby. It’s a way of life! It gives you speed, exercise, flexibility and freedom. We set out to create a bike that would make you want to leave the car at home and take your bike instead. A bike that is perfect for any rider and any situation - affordable, versatile and fun to ride. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The MATE storyDo you know why Copenhagen has been called the happiest city on Earth? BIKING!Riding a bike gives you exercise, allows you to move freely and is the greenest form of transportation. But why aren’t there more people biking everyday then?We realised that in some countries or places, biking is not as easy as “riding a bike” and there can be many obstacles along the way that prevent you to even consider bike as an option in your journeys.We think people would be happier on a bike that could actually remove all the downsides of biking. That’s why we created MATE: to show the world how fun, convenient and rewarding riding a bike can be. So you have freedom and a constant reward of doing the right thing: for yourself, for others, for the planet.

Frequently Asked Questions
Q:The price is very low for an e-bike. Why is that?
A: Our dream is to make cycling accessible to everyone. We have worked long and hard to create an eBike that is not only affordable, but also made of quality components; a quality eBike that is made to last you through the years.
Q: How can you ensure such a low price?
A: We have extensive experience in sourcing and manufacturing products and components. This is a key factor that enables us to maintain a low units cost based on volume. With increased sales and production volume, we are confident that we can ensure a low price, even after the campaign has ended.
Q: How is MATE manufactured?
A: We have spent lots of time finding the right suppliers and manufacturers for MATE. Our many years experience dealing directly with sourcing companies, factories and shipping companies have helped us a great deal to be able to offer high quality product for the lowest price possible.
Crowdfunding helps us to keep the costs down as we can work together with the factory to produce the right amount of units, without dealing with high storage costs and other related costs.Q: Can i order MATE S even though I do not live in US? We deliver MATE S anywhere in the world as long as local laws permits us to import Mate
NB: It is not legal to drive MATE S on public roads in the EU. You are allowed to own it and drive it on private property.
NB: We have not obtained an import permit for MATE S in Australia. We advise Australian backers to get a MATE City + with a booster upgrade to get a more battery power. Q: How much weight can MATE handle? 
A: MATE is build strong and can handle riders up to 125 kg with ease. 
Q: Doest MATE come in different sizes? 
A: MATE is designed to fit all Meaning that the seat height and front handle can be adjusted according to your needs. So whether you are 150 cm / 4'9'' or over 200 cm / 6'5'' high, you will ride comfortably at your own style.
Q: I can't see the battery - where is it? 
A: Batteries are not something you should be spending your time looking at - so it is well hidden in within the middle frame, protected by a locking mechanism.  
Q: How much does MATE weight?
A: MATE City weighs approximately 19 kg (42 lbs) without the battery and 21,5 kgs with the battery. MATE City+ weighs approximately 19 kg (42 lbs) without the battery and 22,5 kgs with the battery. MATE S weighs approximately 20,2 kg (44 lbs) without the battery and 23,7 kgs with the battery. But it's carrying handle in the middle of the frame makes it easy to lift.
Q: How long does the MATE battery last?
A: The battery inside MATE City is built to last on average up to 50 km (30 mi) with the pedal assist. With the upgraded battery found in MATE City+ and MATE S, you can get up to 80 km (55 mi). The battery takes around 5-6 hours charge or 2-4 hours with the added speed charger perk.  
Q: Can I still bike on MATE if the battery runs out of power?
A: Of course! If you run out of power, you can cycle as you would do with a regular bicycle. Even without an engine - it still feels like a dream to ride.
Q: Can I charge the battery by pedalling?
A: At the moment, MATE primarily gets its power from the charger that is provided with the bike upon purchase. However, this is a feature we are currently looking into. 
Q: Can the battery be removed?
A: Yes. The battery is designed in such a way that you can change it or replace with 2 easy steps that takes less than a minute. Simply fold the middle frame, pull out the battery and you’re done. 
Q: How is MATE delivered and is it easy to assemble?
A: MATE comes delivered with instructions in safely packed box and requires minimal assembly. You can also find help on our extensive helpdesk

Q: How much does shipping cost?
A: Shipping is set to $200 to $300 USD (depending on your destination) due to the fact that we ship worldwide directly from our assembly in China. It is also one of the reasons MATEs price is so low, as there are no intermediary between you and the factory #MATEaffordable.Q: I live in Denmark, can I pick it up myself? 
No. MATE eBike is ordered in bulk and will be shipping to individuals directly from our assembly in China, and to a regional commercial warehouse that is not setup for walk-in or local pickup.All MATEs will be shipped via ground shipping to the address on file. 
Q: What kind of warranty do you offer?  
A: All MATE bikes and batteries come with a 2 year manufacturer's warranty. Should you encounter some production related default in that timeframe, we will simply contact our customer support and we will take care of it. As many elements of a bike may get damaged due to normal cycling use, we do not offer warranty on parts such as tires, disc brakes, chain etc.Q: What is your returns-policy?This is the ""MATE-promise"": We are so confident that you will love your new MATE so much, that we offer you a 14 days money back guarantee after you have received it, if you are not satisfied. However, if you decide to do so, your MATE bike must be in new and re-sellable condition. #MATEpromise

Q: What about spare parts? Can any bike shop assist me?
A: The MATE battery is custom built for our frame and spare batteries will be able to buy from us. The rest of the components are fairly standard, meaning that you can upgrade/customise your bike as you desire with other parts either from us or your local bike shop. Q: Is it really true I can get up to 100 miles on a single charge with ""BOOSTER""? In perfect conditions and in ECO+ mode = Assist level 1 this can be done - but in general milage is depending on power-assist setting, terrain, total bike/rider weight and weather conditions. On ""BOOSTER"" battery, you can get anywhere between 20-100 miles, depending on your riding style. For maximum range, please use the pedals when in steep situations and when accelerating. **All MILES/KILOMETERS listed on Indiegogo are ""UP TO"" and not guaranteed.**
Q: Do I need a licence to ride MATE?
A: No. Our bikes are made 100% street legal.

It will be possible to change these settings with some reprogramming which we will make available after the campaign through MATE.community.  Q: Who is responsible for any additional taxes, duties or VAT/GST?

We are Team SDREAM, an electric bicycle creator based in Los Angeles and has factories and suppliers in Europe, China, and Southeast Asia, aiming to design the most stylish and strengthened e-Bike for you, for fun, and for proud. We love the balance that the bicycle brings to the world and also believe that a sense of adventure makes life better. So we created SDREAM e-Bike to inspire people to go further, see more, meet new friends and create amazing experiences. Electric bikes are increasingly regarded as a green alternative to polluting vehicles, as well as an efficient way to the ""last mile"" commute. However, the high rate of theft is still disturbing to the bike owners around the world. To combat this, we have put a strong emphasis on building an e-bike that cannot be stolen, despite its attractive looking. Now SDREAM folding e-Bike is coming out to be an affordable option to ones who like to travel and being secured. We build SDREAM, which is more than a ton of fun.  It is a medium to connect people to nature, rider to their bike, and people to people.   Click Here For The Press Kit  1. The price is lower than other e-bikes on the market. How is it possible? Our team is dedicated to creating the most affordable e- Bike on the market that is of high quality yet with the lowest price. We spent great efforts in searching for cost-effective suppliers and manufacturing. Crowdfunding helps us to control the cost, as we have the right amount of units, without having to deal with the storage expense and other related costs. Most importantly, we hope to build a SDREAM family in the world with early SDREAMers, and let everybody enjoy smart cycling easily. 2. Where is the place you hide the battery? I can’t see it from the body. To increase the security of the battery and for a holistic aesthetic, we designed the battery case to be hidden perfectly in the e-Bike frame. 3. Is the battery fixed in the tube or can be removed? The battery is removable. Just fold the bike frame at the middle. Unlock the battery and pull it out. You can remove the battery for charging or replacing easily with only 2 steps. 4. What if the battery runs out of power? Can I still ride my SDREAM? No problem! Just ride it like any regular bicycle. 5. Do I need a license to ride SDREAM on the street? No. SDREAM eBikes are made 100% street legal. 6. What is the weight limit for SDREAM? SDREAM is strengthened built and can handle anyone of up to 130 kg easily. 7. Is there any height limit for SDREAM? The height of the SDREAM seat is between 77cm-100cm.

Other components of the bike are fairly standard, you may easily find a replacement from your local bike shop to get it upgraded or repaired. You are welcome to contact us for information. 11.

<b>ZAP Urban has been engineered for the city commuter.</b><br/>ZAP Urban is the bike for those less likely to leave the beaten track. It’s for the commuter who likes the idea of pushing the pedals but doesn’t want to reach their destination in a pool of sweat. Single speed, it’s ready for the urban commute, visiting friends, or getting you around on the weekends.<br/><br/>While sharing the same frame as the the ZAP Cross, the Urban is a more streamlined, minimal bike. No shocks, no gears, less weight.<div>

High Quality Build Our new ZAP Bikes incorporate 36v 250w E-Life CST Hub motors. E-bike hub motors have been use for years in harsh environments. They are highly efficient, simple and affordable. We have chosen ours for its weight, 10sp cassette &amp; disc compatibility. This motor is over 1kg lighter than others in its class.<br/><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We use Rockshox XC TK 32 forks, Shimano Deore 10sp 11-36 Drivetrain and high quality build throughout. These components are light and built to last! </span><br/><br/>Sealed Housing for Electric Components</span><br/>We have designed our frame to house all the Electric components in the centre of the frame. This shelters it from the exterior elements. <br/><br/><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Low Weight + even d</b><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">istr</b><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">ibution</b><br/>ZAP bikes have almost 50/50 weight distribution. The E-Housing is low and directly connected to frame allowing the frame tubing to takes all the weight. This means no movement, no rattle and no wear. <br/>Also ZAP Cross is 18.5kg, around 7kg lighter than other bikes in its class. ZAP Urban is 17kg, competing with the lightest E-Bikes on the market.<br/><br/><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Sealed from the elements</b><br/>Our frame is designed with the electric components sealed from the elements. The motor cable runs inside the chainstay. The Torque Sensor inside the bottom bracket. What this means is no water or dirt can affect the electrics.<br/><br/><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Torque Sensor</b><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1230219/files/20150218012710-TST_diagram.png?1424251630"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>By using a Torque sensor input rather than traditional Axis sensor, power is only used when Torque is applied to the pedals. With an Axis sensor power is used constantly when the pedals are rotating, even when power is not needed. Because of this we can use a lower capacity battery that is lighter, much more efficient, cheaper and we still get 70km range!</p>
<p>This is the most innovative change in our new model. This is the input method to activate the motor. Current Axis sensors, activate the motor as the magnets on the crank move past the sensor. This is simple and works well. The problem is this can work without the chain. This means if you ride in low gear and put little effort in the motor + battery has to work more to drive you forward. Riding with this Axis sensor was the gauge for working out the battery capacity required for an adequate range, of around 60km. The battery size needed to be 11ah. This weights about 3.5kg.</p>
<p>Using a torque sensor means the motor only works as hard as the rider's input. Your pedaling matches the motor. Because of this the battery size can be reduced. We are using a 8.8ah battery, getting the same range of 70km - if not more. This weights about 1.5kg, that’s 3kgs less so far! Less weight on the bike means greater efficiency and range.</p>
<b>Lighter Wheels/Hydraulic Disc Brakes</b><br/>Lighter wheels, roll faster. By using a super lightweight motor, light weight rims and tyres, we have reduced the wheel weight significantly. This makes for quicker acceleration, less power draw from battery and holding rolling speed much easier.<br/> <br/>Hydraulic Disc Brakes are extremely powerful and require very little maintenance. They work even if your when is buckled (not very likely with our wheels). Pad wear from discs still causes dust but is much less and confined to the brake calliper, keeping your bike much cleaner.<br/><br/><b>Lithium Battery Technology </b><br/>The bikes utilise Lithium 18650 Samsung cells. This light weight lithium battery technology is driving a revolution in electric products and the e-bike is no different. The 18650 cell is becoming the standard cell size for a lot of products, the Tesla S for one. We have a unique battery design and configuration but by using this common cell type repairs and replacements are easy. Also the cost will reduce over time as more of these cells are produced.<br/><br/><b>Digital Display</b><br/>Our display gives you, KM p/hr, Odometer, Remaining Battery, Battery Voltage, Trip, Current Draw and a Clock.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1200580/files/20150205225743-linebreak_grey.png?1423205863"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<b>Why you ride your bike:</b><ul>
<li>It keeps you fit: mentally and physically. </li>
<li>It's a time-efficient way of getting from A to B</li>
<li>It saves you money - money on fuel, parking, and a heap of money if you make the decision to go without a car.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Why ride an e-bike: </b></p>
<ul>
<li>Easier to ride/less intensive than a normal bike and allows you to ride much further. </li>
<li>You can still enjoy all the other benefits you gain from riding.</li>
<li>Get to work without sweating, even uphill routes, and no need to shower.</li>
<li>Easier to ride if you’re unfit, injured or elderly.</li>

<p><i><b>We will continue to update our FAQ as the campaign takes shape, send your inquiries through and we will be sure to answer them for you! </b></i></p>
<p><b>1. Will your ZAP bike climb hills easily?</b></p>
<p>Definitely! There is a misconception among the bike community that larger wattage motors mean better hill climbing. While there is a connection between the two, It is more of a generalisation due to the multitude of variables at play. Our brushless 250W motors will take you up most hills at a quick pace. </p>
<p>For more information, read about our <i>Torque Sensor Technology</i> in the ""features of our new range"" section. </p>
<p><b>2. Do you require a license to ride a ZAP bike in Australia?</b></p>
<p>No license is required in Australia to ride a ZAP bike as all our bikes fit under the current 250W power limitation. All Our bikes comply with EN 15194 requirements and safe to ride.</p>
<p>Vehicle Standard (Australian Design Rule – Definitions and Vehicle Categories)    2005 Amendment 6 – F2012L01123</p>
<p>EN 15194 is becoming internationally accepted as the standard for power-assisted pedal cycles.  When compared to the existing ADR definition, it increases the allowable power from 200 to 250 watts and specifies this as a continuous rating.  It also restricts the top speed to 25 kilometres per hour, requires the rider to pedal to access the power and sets a number of construction safety requirements.</p>
<p><b>3. Can I ride ZAP bike on the footpath?</b></p>
<p>ZAP bikes can be ridden on any area that a bicycle is legally allowed to ride on. This means they can be used on shared footpaths, bicycle paths, bicycle margin strips and at the side of the road when no alternative is available.<br/><br/>Currently cities around the world have differing regulations for electric bikes. Please check with your local authorities to find out the latest on where you can use your electric bike.</p>
<p><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">3. Does the battery remove? </b><br/></p>
<p><span>Unlike other e-bikes, the battery does not remove on the ZAP Urban or Cross. We have designed it this way because current e-bike's batteries can rattle and become loose over time, which can also cause contact problems from corrosion. To avoid this the battery and controller in the ZAP bikes is secured in the housing, bolted to the frame. There is zero movement, it's completely sealed to the elements and has a low down, central weight. <span>If it does need to be removed its simple, undo 3 hex bolts and slide out. </span></span></p>
<span><span><b>4. How does it charge?</b></span></span><p><span><span>Charging your ZAP bike is very straight forward.  Each ZAP bike will come with a charging unit - a plug-in cord and adaptor - similar to a computer charger. These will be supplied with instructions for use and a problem shooting guide. <br/><br/><b>5. What does it cost to charge?</b> </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Extremely little! We have calculated the cost to be around 10c per charge. <br/>Each charge will provide around 70km distance, this of course depends on variables of rider weight, road conditions and elevation. Our trials have shown range of 70-80kms range on single charge.   <br/><br/><span><b>6. Why is it sold in USD, instead of AUD? </b></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When we manufacturer ZAP bikes, our cost are in USD. We wanted to offer the bikes as cheap as possible, just above cost price. If we priced in AUD (or any other currency) we could not forecast the exact figure we required. We knew that we would need to increase the price slightly to be prepared in the event the AUD dropped against the USD, as it has been quite volatile lately. This way we have been able to offer our bikes at the lowest price possible, making electric bikes more accessible to more people. We also thought pricing in USD would make it easier for international customers.<br/><br/><span><span><b>6. When do we expect delivery?</b></span></span><br/></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The planned delivery date is July - August 2015. The team at ZAP has extensive experience in manufacturing and supply, we feel prepared for any obstacles that might be thrown our way.

</div></div>","INDIEGOGO SPECIAL PRICE - CLOSING SOON! ZAP have reached their fixed funding target. This means manufacture has begun, and we will be closing our special price. ZAP Bikes will remain available for purchase on Indiegogo, but the 60% off is closing soon! DON'T MISS OUT!!!There are plenty of electric bikes on the market—many require deep pockets - $4000USD+ is pretty standard when you're buying quality. The savings along the way may make this worthwhile, but it’s a lot of cash to answer the question! We want to bring the new ZAP electric bike to the market at well under half that cost through clever design, construction and technology.  Not only that, the ZAP bike has packaged together the best in technology - pressure sensitive torque sensor that distributes power evenly to match the riders pace, making for huge gains in efficiency over conventional E-Bikes. The ZAP e-bike is clever:

It’s armed with a torque sensor – It only uses the power when needed!
It has a RFID key-less start, no more fiddly locks!
It's lighter than your average electric bike and brilliantly balanced.
Its electrics are completely sealed in a specially designed housing
It's genuinely long on range. Up to 70km on a single charge!

We want you to help us bring this to the market because we think it can change the way people commute...for the better. For convenience, for fitness, for efficiency, and for green technology, it's ZAP. 




DELIVERY DATES EXPLAINED
All orders placed during ZAP campaign will be included in First Round Delivery. Orders placed during ZAP InDemand (after May 15th 2015) will be scheduled for Second Round Delivery.

If you have further questions about your order, feel free to inquire directly via the comments section (you can set to private) or email info@zapbikes.com.au.



Introducing ZAP Urban & Cross: two bikes that incorporate electric technology to take you where you want to go. Road or trail, city or cross-country.



ZAP Urban has been engineered for the city commuter.ZAP Urban is the bike for those less likely to leave the beaten track. It’s for the commuter who likes the idea of pushing the pedals but doesn’t want to reach their destination in a pool of sweat. Single speed, it’s ready for the urban commute, visiting friends, or getting you around on the weekends.While sharing the same frame as the the ZAP Cross, the Urban is a more streamlined, minimal bike. No shocks, no gears, less weight.


   ZAP Cross gets you off the beaten path.Unlike so many electric bikes before, our designers have sweated on balance, weight and the bike’s centre of gravity so that the ZAP Cross is up for whatever you want to put it through.At just over 18 kilograms, it’s around 7 kilos lighter than most electric bikes in its class.
With Rockshox forks, RFID key-less start, Shimano Deore 10-speed drivetrain, Promax hydraulic disc brakes and lightweight, off-road tyres on board, the ZAP Cross is ready to go wherever you want to take it - with electrics sealed from the elements, there’s no fear of damage to the technology on board.


It’s the innovative technology on-board ZAP Urban and Cross, that transform them into something else altogether. Through sleek design and a powerful long life Lithium Ion cells, we've built these bikes so you can do all the work, or let the bike take you along for the ride.Engage the ZAP’s torque sensor, and your minimal efforts are multiplied. Want a big hand up a hill? Engage the boost and you’ll get the power that you’re after.ZAP bikes let you decide the fitness benefit you want from your ride and the freedom to delegate the work to the bike. The technological developments on-board the Cross and Urban, mean two big things: less weight and more range.There’s no heavy power cells to sway the balance of the bike, but a slimline integrated into the bike’s centre of gravity that results in a near-on 50/50 weight distribution.On-road or recreational, assisted or unassisted, The ZAP Urban and Cross are ready to take you there.



High Quality Build Our new ZAP Bikes incorporate 36v 250w E-Life CST Hub motors. E-bike hub motors have been use for years in harsh environments. They are highly efficient, simple and affordable. We have chosen ours for its weight, 10sp cassette & disc compatibility. This motor is over 1kg lighter than others in its class.We use Rockshox XC TK 32 forks, Shimano Deore 10sp 11-36 Drivetrain and high quality build throughout. These components are light and built to last! Sealed Housing for Electric ComponentsWe have designed our frame to house all the Electric components in the centre of the frame. This shelters it from the exterior elements. Low Weight + even distributionZAP bikes have almost 50/50 weight distribution. The E-Housing is low and directly connected to frame allowing the frame tubing to takes all the weight. This means no movement, no rattle and no wear. Also ZAP Cross is 18.5kg, around 7kg lighter than other bikes in its class. ZAP Urban is 17kg, competing with the lightest E-Bikes on the market.Sealed from the elementsOur frame is designed with the electric components sealed from the elements. The motor cable runs inside the chainstay. The Torque Sensor inside the bottom bracket. What this means is no water or dirt can affect the electrics.Torque Sensor
By using a Torque sensor input rather than traditional Axis sensor, power is only used when Torque is applied to the pedals. With an Axis sensor power is used constantly when the pedals are rotating, even when power is not needed. Because of this we can use a lower capacity battery that is lighter, much more efficient, cheaper and we still get 70km range!
This is the most innovative change in our new model. This is the input method to activate the motor. Current Axis sensors, activate the motor as the magnets on the crank move past the sensor. This is simple and works well. The problem is this can work without the chain. This means if you ride in low gear and put little effort in the motor + battery has to work more to drive you forward. Riding with this Axis sensor was the gauge for working out the battery capacity required for an adequate range, of around 60km. The battery size needed to be 11ah. This weights about 3.5kg.
Using a torque sensor means the motor only works as hard as the rider's input. Your pedaling matches the motor. Because of this the battery size can be reduced. We are using a 8.8ah battery, getting the same range of 70km - if not more. This weights about 1.5kg, that’s 3kgs less so far! Less weight on the bike means greater efficiency and range.
Lighter Wheels/Hydraulic Disc BrakesLighter wheels, roll faster. By using a super lightweight motor, light weight rims and tyres, we have reduced the wheel weight significantly. This makes for quicker acceleration, less power draw from battery and holding rolling speed much easier. Hydraulic Disc Brakes are extremely powerful and require very little maintenance. They work even if your when is buckled (not very likely with our wheels). Pad wear from discs still causes dust but is much less and confined to the brake calliper, keeping your bike much cleaner.Lithium Battery Technology The bikes utilise Lithium 18650 Samsung cells. This light weight lithium battery technology is driving a revolution in electric products and the e-bike is no different. The 18650 cell is becoming the standard cell size for a lot of products, the Tesla S for one. We have a unique battery design and configuration but by using this common cell type repairs and replacements are easy. Also the cost will reduce over time as more of these cells are produced.Digital DisplayOur display gives you, KM p/hr, Odometer, Remaining Battery, Battery Voltage, Trip, Current Draw and a Clock.

To bring ZAP Cross & Urban to market, we’re seeking to raise $65,000 USD - funds that will help us with the tooling that’s required to launch into full-scale production and bring the convenience, efficiency, and green technology of the new ZAP e-bikes to market.


Why you ride your bike:
It keeps you fit: mentally and physically. 
It's a time-efficient way of getting from A to B
It saves you money - money on fuel, parking, and a heap of money if you make the decision to go without a car.

Why ride an e-bike: 

Easier to ride/less intensive than a normal bike and allows you to ride much further. 
You can still enjoy all the other benefits you gain from riding.
Get to work without sweating, even uphill routes, and no need to shower.
Easier to ride if you’re unfit, injured or elderly.

ZAP Bikes were established in 2010 to bring an alternative transport to the busy streets of Perth. The brainchild of Steve Dimov, Paul Rankin and George Tuffin, the vision was for a stylish, sleek vehicle that would be easy to ride, reduce the owner’s carbon footprint and cut the costs of inner city travel. The result was the range of ZAP Electric Bikes.Customers range from grey nomads to young, inner-city dwellers and everyone in between. Because ZAP Bikes are designed to replace car trips in the inner city, you can see more, explore more and make a difference to the environment too. 


Even if you are not in the market for an electric bike, you can share ZAP Bikes to your friends and family. Spread the word to ensure they are riding a quality piece of technology that will take them further, with ease. 
With your help we can complete this project that has been two years in the making. Follow our journey on Facebook.

</div>","We plug-in vehicle owners are a social bunch.  We love our vehicles.  We wave at each other when we drive by.  We sometimes take way too much time answering people who ask ""Like it?""We tend to have a very high interest in numbers.  Especially our mile/kWh, MPG-equivalent, and our real-world range.  The existing data portals from manufacturers don't give all the info we'd like and more importantly they separate us into silos (LEAF portal, Volt portal, etc..). So when we turn to standard OBD loggers we find our vehicles on the ""not-compatible"" list.Where's the love?Here it is.  A logger that IS compatible with nearly every currently available production plug-in vehicle in North America (and many of the vehicles internationally). We've been logging these vehicles for a few years for fleets, and with 
your backing, we'll finish adapting that technology to make the world's 
best logger & app for EV owners.  Through the app EV owners can tell
 their personal EV story by being able to track, share, cheer, and 
connect.   Our technology has been featured in:The AppA few screenshots from the app are provided below. We will launch both Android and iOS versions.  In the 
first pair of screenshots you see the Last Trip summary that provides 
the real-world numbers from the last trip.  This includes a ranking 
compared to all logged trips for your vehicle, compared to those on your
 team (more on teams later) this week and compared to others of the same
 model in your area. Additionally it gives you the starting and ending 
SOC, as well as the ability to post the result to the social networks of
 your choosing.  The lifetime summary page provides summary 
results for all data we've logged on your vehicle.  Again, it ranks 
against both your team and owners of the same model in your area.  Of 
interest to many owners will be the Estimated Battery Health value. 
 Fortunately we have an expert in battery degradation in hybrid & electric vehicles on the team (got his Ph.D. beating up EV batteries).  Please note, we can estimate battery health on all the vehicles listed EXCEPT the Accord PHEV and the Porsche... we don't get quite enough signals on those models, yet. The
 next screenshots are specific to public charging etiquette.  Each 
backer that receives a myEV logger will also receive a window sticker.  The window sticker includes a personalized QR code.  This can be used 
by others in the myEV community to a) ask if they can unplug you at a 
public charging station in a privacy-protected way, b) give you an 
electric fist-bump, and c) request a connection to share info. The
 last set of screenshots show the unlock screens and one of the unlocked
 features.  You and your team will collectively rack up EV miles.  As 
you hit EV mile thresholds additional features in the app will unlock. 
 The unlock feature shown below provides a histogram of charging 
events. RewardsHow does myEV compare to other loggers?Click here to see a benefit comparison chart. *Please note: this chart was made to highlight the benefits of the MyCarma myEV contrasted against other loggers, and isn’t intended to be an absolute comparison. Other loggers (such as cellular) may have their own functionality & benefits, such as remote lock/unlock, GPS position etc. Using a Y-harness, myEV can also be run in parallel with other loggers.Why would you want to log your EV?Here are the top 5 reasons we've heard from fellow EV owners: 
I want more data than what the dash shows me (ie. % SOC, not bars)
I want to keep an eye on the health of my battery. 
I want to track my range throughout the year to see the impact of the weather, and to compare this to other EV owners in my area.  
The other data system you use went down. Again. 
I love my car and want to share my results with others that are in the 
EV community, and those that are considering becoming EV owners! 

We've been listening.  And by adapting our fleet hardware and decodes (ability to log EV signals) we can give the community what it's looking for.  Decoding and CleaningThe challenge with logging EVs is getting the signals.  Most after-market loggers use emissions-related signals.  That's why they can't get the energy/battery info that we all want.  To work on EVs you need to be able to log the non-standard signals.  We do this. Additionally, since they're non-standard, each manufacturer uses different signals that can have slightly different meanings.  For instance, battery power from one manufacturer can mean something slightly different than battery power from another.  So in addition to decoding the signals they need to be normalized to be able to share across vehicles.  It's taken us a while, but we've figured this out.

Read more about the update here.July 8th update: We've added a free upgrade: all loggers will now come with on-board storage!July 12th update: It has happened, $25k and 100%! A huge THANK YOU to all our backers!
July 22nd update: Our campaign has successfully ended; thanks for backing us! To get more info, you can now visit our website.
Q&AWe've had some great questions that have come up a few times.  Here's a quick Q&A. Can I use the myEV device in parallel with another device?Yes.  You'll need a y-harness. Since the myEV device is fully passive on most vehicles (doesn't create signal traffic like an OBD device does) it plays nicely with others.  My vehicle (i3, Outlander PHEV,  RAV4 EV, ...) isn't on your list.  Will it be?For most of these, yes.   Shoot us an email at lovemyplug@mycarma.com and we can confirm vehicles/timing for you.  Most of the vehicles will be added to the list before the October ship date.  Are you going to also show ""X""? (X can be any other signal/value that may be of interest)With the signals we're able to get, there are a number of things we can include.  We want to prioritize what get's included/added with the backers.  We'll get the draft list posted here in the next day to give you a better idea of what we are planning to add.  Please keep the questions coming!  And thanks everyone for your time and backing!  --The T-ShirtsFor those backers that pick the Outfitter Perk (T-Shirt) here are the options for you to choose from:T-Shirt Option #1 (available for men & women)T-Shirt Option #2 (available for men & women)T-Shirt Option #3 (available for men & women)T-Shirt Back on All Shirts",25.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is Adam Smith; I am majoring
in Entrepreneurship at Baylor
 University. I am launching
a new product; Bike Pipe, a bicycle exhaust kit. It improves the classic idea
of putting cards in your spokes making it louder, more durable and easy to attach
for children. Bike Pipe is also easily kicked on/off while riding.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/852914/files/20140912164255-how_it_works.png?1410565375"" src="""" style=""""/></p>My product replicates the motorcycle look and sound making every
bicycle roar and exciting. A durable reed smacks each spoke and produces a loud
noise. This noise is then amplified through a horn shaped exhaust which increases
the awareness of the rider to pedestrians and other vehicles. This improves the
overall safety and well being of the rider.<p></p>

<br/><br/><p>Growing up in Southern
 California, I began riding dirt bikes at the age of eight.
Naturally, bicycles were my next best choice when I was not on the track. When I
was riding a bicycle though, I missed the loud noise of my dirt bike. Like
generations before me I used cards and stuck them in between my spokes. Using
rare baseball cards, I ended up destroying some of my father’s collection. Although
upset, my father got an idea to improve this classic idea. He made a prototype
of the Bike Pipe out of spare motorcycle parts. The prototype was awesome! Kids
on the block literally lined up to ride and were even willing to pay! My father
then acquired patents on the idea. Unfortunately, at the time we were
financially stressed and we didn’t have the funds to take this product to the
next level. <br/></p>

<br/>
This brings us to the present. I am 22 years old and have successfully launched
and grown TexasBartenders.com, a legitimate mobile bartending business. However,
I have always been passionate about Bike Pipe. I have focused my attention on
this product and for the past two of years. I am very excited about how far we
have come. I am just a couple steps to launching my child hood toy and making
this dream come true. I have partnered with local Texas manufacturers and distributers and we are
set to launch in December. It is my vision to provide Bike Pipe to children all
over the nation before Christmas day. <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/852921/files/20140912164619-Head_Shot_of_Adam_Smith.JPG?1410565579"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>Our goal to start production is $10,000. With this money we will be able to fund the initial order. The $10,000 will go towards the cost of producing the units. The biggest
 cost is the mold tooling required for the injection molding process.

 other costs) What is left

<p>We want to allow every child

(Choose an ""In-stock"" perk to get your bike by May 2021)2. Back NOW to lock in Indiegogo-exclusive prices.  We have no intention of ever selling our bikes at this price again.  The Duro Rise is an electric bike built for adventure.  It is powerful, capable, and thoughtfully designed to be beautiful and fun.  An ebike you can ride anywhere you ride a traditional bike, but enables you to adventure further than ever before.  We designed the Duro Rise because traditional bikes and motorcycles have limitations that were holding us back. Bikes are limited by physical capabilities and motorcycles, while they may facilitate amazing adventures, aren’t always legal on the trails we want to explore. Motorcycles also require a special license and yearly registration. As we began exploring the world of ebikes we discovered that most ebikes are complicated, lack style, and aren’t designed to handle the rigors of our adventures.The Duro Rise will take you further without conditioning, red tape, licenses or registration. It is an uncomplicated bike, beautifully designed, created to help you explore like never before.      The duro rise is built with a 1,000 watt motor powered by a 48V 17.5ah Samsung battery so you can go fast for as far as your wanderlust takes you.   Seven gear transmission paired with the powerful motor setup makes going up just as fun as going down.  Full front and rear suspension with an extended padded seat makes the Rise comfortable and smooth to ride, and much safer over uneven terrain. There is even room for your favorite friend to hitch a ride. Dual piston hydraulic disc brake system installed on both the front and rear wheel so you can stop and stay in control when you’re riding fast over less-stable terrain.  Nine levels of motor power assistance. Adjust the motor to be as fast or slow as you like with just the push of a button.  Want to go fast?  press the “+” button on the handlebar mounted controller to go to level nine and unleash the Duro Rise.  Want to go slower? Use the “-” button to adjust power assistance down and limit the power assisted speed.  Bright 2000 lumen headlight, paired with the brake light, looks cool, keeps you safe and lights your path so you can explore into the night.  We have 60 completed bikes in our USA warehouse READY TO SHIP NOW. The Duro Rise is not a prototype.  It is a finished product that we ride every single day. As soon as this Indiegogo concludes we will immediately ship these bikes to our first 60 backers. - Estimated delivery is May 2021.We are ready to start production on our next order and need your help.  Production will begin at completion of the Indiegogo and our bikes will be completed in time for you to enjoy a beautiful summer ride.   - Estimated delivery is August 2021.  Duro was created out of our own passion for riding fast and exploring far with our favorite people.  Hours of Northern California adventures inspired the beauty and capability built into the Duro Rise.  Yosemite, the Redwood Forest, Lake Tahoe - all have their prints on our brand and bike.  Duro is a community for shared adventure.  By backing our campaign you not only receive an amazing ebike, you become a part of our family.  So come, adventure with us, and together we can escape the ordinary.     ShippingIf you are one of the first 60 backers and are able to grab an ""in-stock"" perk, We will be shipping these bikes out at the conclusion of this campaign. You can expect to receive your bikes by May 2021.If you are unable to snag an ""in-stock"" bike your bike is estimated for an August 2021 delivery date.We guarantee that at the conclusion of this campaign we will ship the ebikes to the first 60 indiegogo supporters. Shipping is only available in the United States at this time. We offer free shipping to the continental United States.
