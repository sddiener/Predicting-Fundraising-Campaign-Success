<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>My name is Lorenzo Cella, I'm a robotic engineering student and a commuter. Every day I take the train to go to university. From home I have to walk to the station, take the train and once there I have to walk to class. I have to do the reverse path back home every noon. I've counted that I spend 1 hour and 30 minutes walking every day, 7km (4.5 miles). I noticed that covering this distance by foot every day, in addition to wasting my time, makes me get home tired and with little desire to do anything else.</p>
<p><b>I thought of several possible alternatives to move more quickly and with less effort. </b>Some commuters use the bike. But the bike on the train increases the cost of the ticket and not all allow the shipping, also is bulky and easy to steal. After thinking about it I realized that the ideal means of transport would have to be small enough to take with me.</p>
<p>Something like this would be an electric skateboard, but the ones on the market are all modified longboard, long and heavy. It is not what I was looking for.</p>
<p>For this reason I created <b>Bolt: the world's smallest and lightest electric vehicle in the world.</b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1314826/files/20150322080140-bolt-under-the-station.jpg?1427036500"" src=""""/></p>

<p>To build the Bolt I got help from my father, a photographer, electronics engineer and drones pilot. Over the years, we have made several tech projects together and gained experience in the field of brushless motors, lithium-ion battery, radio technology. For example, we made an electric bike, some drones and a lot of tech equipment for photography. Usually, I take care of the software and design and him of electronics and mechanics.</p>
<p>After a year of testing and prototyping, we built the final version from the ground up. All you see is a single board that contains all the electronics and the power to take you to 29km/h (18mph). All the technology is hidden from sight.</p>

We often need a way to move for short everyday trips. But how? 
Walking is too slow and time-consuming. Most of the time taking the car is cumbersome and useless because you need to find space for parking. The bicycle must always be locked and made safe otherwise can be stolen. Even if you use public transport, you still need a last-mile solution small enough to be carried with you everywhere.
Today, we are happy to present Bolt, a super portable electric vehicle.
It's not just an electric skateboard. Bolt is something new. It is the smallest electric vehicle in the world.
 
 
 A small great revolution in the world of transportation
Bolt is the first really portable vehicle that can be carried anywhere. At home, in the classroom or in the office.
It is an amazing mean of transport: small, lightweight, easy to use, with the low power consumption and smart.

By levitating a pod on a bed of air and propelling it through a partially evacuated tube, speeds of up to 700mph can be reached.

Hyperloop One conducted their first full-scale test in vacuum last week, and several other Hyperloop companies have raised millions to build transport systems in South Korea, Dubai, and Europe.</p><p>In 2015, SpaceX announced an international competition for student teams to design and build a working prototype pod to compete on a one-mile test track that SpaceX has built at their HQ in Hawthorne. The first few teams hit the track in January, and now Texas Guadaloop is one of 22 teams left competing on the track this August. Our team has worked tirelessly these past two years to create a cost-effective and energy-efficient solution to make the Hyperloop a reality.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Air Bearings.</strong></p><p>Elon's original idea for the Hyperloop was to use air-bearings to levitate in a frictionless environment.

By levitating a pod on a bed of air and propelling it through a partially evacuated tube, speeds of up to 700mph can be reached. It's as fast as a plane, but still as convenient to ride as a train.(Guadaloop City: Poster Option 1)This is crazy. Could this really work?There is no doubt a Hyperloop will be built. Hyperloop One conducted their first full-scale test in vacuum last week, and several other Hyperloop companies have raised millions to build transport systems in South Korea, Dubai, and Europe.In 2015, SpaceX announced an international competition for student teams to design and build a working prototype pod to compete on a one-mile test track that SpaceX has built at their HQ in Hawthorne. The first few teams hit the track in January, and now Texas Guadaloop is one of 22 teams left competing on the track this August. Our team has worked tirelessly these past two years to create a cost-effective and energy-efficient solution to make the Hyperloop a reality. Air Bearings.Elon's original idea for the Hyperloop was to use air-bearings to levitate in a frictionless environment. Imagine an air hockey table, but where air comes out of the puck instead of the table. Since the SpaceX-Hyperloop competition was announced, there has been no team or company to test the viability of air bearings at high speeds.(Meet Furiosa - our pod ) We are one of the first teams in the world who are building an air bearing pod and are preparing to test it at high velocities on the SpaceX-Hyperloop test track. The implications for transportation fueled off of air are groundbreaking and have the power to disrupt the transportation industry. Why not MagLev? MagLev utilizes magnets to levitate the pod whereas air-bearings utilize pressurized air. MagLev is a proven technology and has no doubt been tested thoroughly,  but the advantages of utilizing air-bearings are enormous. Air-bearings do not need to hit a specific speed to levitate and they do not exhibit drag. This means we could use air bearings for shorter distances and destinations without costly expenditures of MagLev. There is a reason why MagLev trains haven't popped up in America. Imagine putting them in a more expensive vacuum tube.Will the Hyperloop really become the world's next major mode of transportation?The prototype we are building for the Hyperloop can support thousands of pounds at a fraction of cost and energy. Building a full-scale system has the potential to make goods and supplies flow more efficiently than current methods. Additional highways and cars won't solve traffic problems, but a Hyperloop can let you work in one city and live in another. Guadaloop wants to be the team to bring Hyperloop to Texas. (Proposed Guadaloop Texas Hyperloop Route) Long-term visionThe Texas triangle contains the largest number of super commuters in the U.S. Our dream is to build the Hyperloop in Texas, connecting major growth cities such as Austin, Dallas, and Houston. Will you join us and make this happen? #LetsBuildThisShitAfter presenting in front of SpaceX engineers at Design Weekend in January 2016, our team was not selected to build a pod for Competition Weekend I last January.

<p>The 8th Annual Holiday Drive will
once again benefit returning soldiers and the Milwaukee Homeless Veterans
Initiative (MHVI). It is our goal to collect basic household items, from
cookware to personal hygiene products to create 250 packaged home starter kits
to support veterans and their families. With your commitment, we can help the
men and women who have served our country. </p>
<p>Since 2007, Mayor Tom Barrett has
held an annual Holiday Drive for servicemen and women. City of Milwaukee
employees, community partners, businesses and residents have risen to the
challenge and collected thousands of toiletries, snacks, goodies and more to
help bring a little holiday cheer to those who have sacrificed for our country.</p>
<p>The drive began as a way for
Mayor Barrett and the City of Milwaukee to share their gratitude with Wisconsin
troops who were far away from their homes during the holidays. More than 2,000
goodie-filled boxes were shipped to Wisconsin troops serving our country
overseas in places like Iraq, Afghanistan and Kosovo.</p>
<p>In 2013, the Holiday Drive took
on a new beneficiary: our veterans. With more and more troops returning home
from overseas service every month, Mayor Barrett and County Executive Chris
Abele formed a partnership to bring awareness to and address the struggles of
veterans who face homelessness or difficulties with stable housing. In
partnering with County Executive Abele, the Holiday Drive went county-wide, and
with the help of the community, 500 complete home starter kits were created for
the Milwaukee Homeless Veterans Initiative, enough to support hundreds of
veterans and their families in the greater Milwaukee area.</p>
<p>Many community businesses and
organizations support this effort annually, including the Brewers Community
Foundation, Lamar Advertising Company and Walgreens.</p>
<p>We are grateful for all support
and donations, but we ask that citizens donate <b><u>only </u></b>the
items listed below. <b><u>Items must be unopened and individually

</div></div>","The 8th Annual Holiday Drive will
once again benefit returning soldiers and the Milwaukee Homeless Veterans
Initiative (MHVI). It is our goal to collect basic household items, from
cookware to personal hygiene products to create 250 packaged home starter kits
to support veterans and their families. With your commitment, we can help the
men and women who have served our country. 
Since 2007, Mayor Tom Barrett has
held an annual Holiday Drive for servicemen and women. City of Milwaukee
employees, community partners, businesses and residents have risen to the
challenge and collected thousands of toiletries, snacks, goodies and more to
help bring a little holiday cheer to those who have sacrificed for our country.
The drive began as a way for
Mayor Barrett and the City of Milwaukee to share their gratitude with Wisconsin
troops who were far away from their homes during the holidays. More than 2,000
goodie-filled boxes were shipped to Wisconsin troops serving our country
overseas in places like Iraq, Afghanistan and Kosovo.
In 2013, the Holiday Drive took
on a new beneficiary: our veterans. With more and more troops returning home
from overseas service every month, Mayor Barrett and County Executive Chris
Abele formed a partnership to bring awareness to and address the struggles of
veterans who face homelessness or difficulties with stable housing. In
partnering with County Executive Abele, the Holiday Drive went county-wide, and
with the help of the community, 500 complete home starter kits were created for
the Milwaukee Homeless Veterans Initiative, enough to support hundreds of
veterans and their families in the greater Milwaukee area.
Many community businesses and
organizations support this effort annually, including the Brewers Community
Foundation, Lamar Advertising Company and Walgreens.
We are grateful for all support
and donations, but we ask that citizens donate only the
items listed below. Items must be unopened and individually
packaged. If you have items you would like to donate that are NOT
listed below, such as furniture or appliances, please contact the Milwaukee Homeless Veterans Initiative  to
see if they accept those items.

 We're students at Singularity University in NASA Research Park working on technology projects to impact the life of billions of people. 
We need to get a car (as a final step) so we can complete the validation of the product by installing the kit, some batteries, hobbyst electronics and tools.


It's an innovative idea that allows small front wheel drive cars to join the hybrid power revolution in any country around the world, without messing with the engine.





Making the bridge between developing countries cheap cars and affordable hybrids.

What We Need & What You Get

It's simple, we need a car and accesories to prove our concept! We've already bought two 10kw engines and controllers, far over our total budget, and they're rushing to come here! Our idea is do the following:
 

Using the latest technologies in electrical engines, advanced electronics and a smart approach for seamless integration with your car’s standard features, to enjoy immediate benefits:



Improved fuel consumption and autonomy: More than 30% fuel savings in urban cycle.


Clean Air: More than 35% improvement in CO2 emissions.


Affordable: Pays itself before first year of usage in most scenarios.


Easy installation with no mechanical changes to your car’s engine. Completely reversible.


Four Wheel Drive: Dynamic mode for reduced fuel consumption + Lock mode for difficult terrain situations.


Cruise Control: Improve road performance with intelligent modes leveraging hybrid advantage to improve fuel performance.


Compatible with NCG conversions.


Minimum maintenance cycle.


Smartphone dashboard: Add an onboard computer to your car.

Online monitoring and upgrading.

  The Impact

By running real test in an affordable car, we can prove that our regenerative hybrid kit can fit any FWD car and pass the needed processes so we can go big scale (maybe an other Indiegogo campaign) and offer it for everyone worldwide. 

Light weight Regenerative battery.
A 30% average fuel efficiency improvement.
$1,499 MSRP 

  Other Ways You Can Help If you have a car you want to donate (or lend) for this project, we are really happy to talk. 
Mechanics and handy-people are always welcome, you can join us in our process adapting the system to the car and having a lot of fun.

Review From an Expert in Car Maintenance

An auto mechanic for 49 years, Scotty Kilmer speaks highly of Anto Fireman. He claimed it's a brave new invention for the auto industry. 

Auto Fireman - Terminator of Car Fire

The risk of fire in a modern car, just driving along, is very low. It's like winning a lottery, only in a bad way. This is a low probability event with extremely high consequences. Safety is an important thing that must be taken to account at all times. There're three major circumstances that might cause a car fire.
The fuel tank is breached because a rock or the drive shaft moves over and contact the fuel tank, which causes a fire.

 The fuel line moves over because the engine has shifted over when the car gets involved in a frontal offset impact or an oblique impact. The engine can shift over 12 inches, which may separate the fuel line and cause a fire.

A lot of impacts happened outside the frame rail where the batteries are usually located. As the impact occurs, the acid in the battery catches on fire and eventually catches the entire compartment on fire.

Three situations above are apparently severe. Because cars are dangerous themselves. The combination of dense fuel, incredible heat, electrical energy, immense airflow, and flammable materials makes a car what it is. You're now living through a potential risk faced by drivers worldwide, a risk that we want to help you to evade.Auto Fireman is a reliable product that is meant to meet all your car extinguishing needs.The product can easily ﬁt inside the engine due to its low dimensions. Furthermore, the car extinguisher is able to properly anchor itself since it is highly magnetic and this coupled with the automatic thermal detection system makes the auto ﬁreman an ideal engine product that will safeguard both yourself and your car in the event of a ﬁre.Small and Magnetic, Easy for InstallationAuto Fireman is a small equipment with a total weight of 134 grams. It has a diameter of only 7 centimeters and height of 3 centimeters. This design is speciﬁcally meant to ensure that the device is actually able to ﬁt in the engine without any alteration of the car's hood to allow for extra space to accommodate it. Its magnetic nature makes sure that the device cannot fall off when the car is moving fast. It's also paired two magnetic coins and two stickers to hold it in the right place.  3 Steps to Install Anto FiremanStep1. Stick the Auto Fireman fire extinguisher on both sides of the motor engine room and ensure the device is even and stable.Step2.  Wind the thermal line around the combustible areas(such as fuel line or electrical wire).Step3. Plug the two ends of the thermal line into the connector of both Auto Fireman extinguishers.Thermal Wire Working as a Conductor   In order to minimize the damage, the fire needs to be detected as soon as it happens. So the basic function of a car fire extinguisher is one that should be able to respond whenever the temperature gets over-heated. In this theory, Auto Fireman uses thermal technology, an aviation technology adopted for a rocket launch, Let’s see how it works.Thermal line(2 meters long), as a component of the detector, is designed to be placed around the combustible areas(such as fuel circuit or electrical wiring) and tied with ribbon.When there is a fire in the motor engine, and the fire gets near the thermal line ( the thermal line will be activated as long as it’s near an open fire or reaches 600℃), it will set fire to the solid propellant inside the red boxes.Absorb Heat & Suppress CombustionRedox reaction can take place in this propellant, and generate effective fire-extinguishing haze particles that break through the sealed membrane and pervade the entire engine room. These effective fire-extinguishing haze particles rapidly absorb the heat of the flame, consume a lot of energy and suppress the exothermic reaction among activity genes so as to stop the chain combustion reaction. This fire-extinguishing method combines physical cooling and chemical inhibition.Put Out Fire Within 30 SecondsIn our every fire extinguishing trial, the fire was put out in less than 30 seconds. The whole process includes the ignition in the engine room, thermal wire triggering the propellant and the fire suppression.   Environmental Friendly Reaction Product60% compositions of the extinguishant are gases (most of N2 and CO2, little CO, NO2, O2, and hydrocarbon) and 40% are rigid granules, including MeO, MeCO3, MeHCO3 and few metal carbides.

You do not know any mechanic, tow, tire-fitter or even know if as a gas station near of you. or imagine you are traveling on a country who is not yours, and you need to call for a mechanic, tow, tire fitter or gas station. How you do that if you don't know anyone, or a simple number to call for automotive rescue?It's a combination that will surely leave you in the road, right ? Not if you have the Car Helper.This situation happens every day, with thousands of people around the world. The person must have signal on the phone but do not know who to call. After all, if you're in an unfamiliar place, you probably will not know who to call for help.Even worse, if you don't have a automotive insurance?We want to solve this problem with a simple solution. Offline map application with a off-line catalog of automotive rescuers information. No matter where you are, and not matter if you have or not a automotive insurance plan. Since you have phone signal, you can call to a automotive rescue by the Car Helper App.[The images below are the current app that need to be completely rebuilt and implemented new features]Not Smart Phone???...Do not have a smartphone? No problem, we think we can solve this problem too. Imagine that your old Nokia phone, one her grandmother used to today, and does not fall apart at all. Yes, we think we can make the Car Helper ""run"" on it too. How? Text message! But you must be thinking. They do not have GPS and don't execute moderns maps apps, as they can use the Car Helper and find a automotive rescue?Triangulation :D Mobile Operators (at least in Brazil) offer business plans where you can find the approximate location of a particular person from the text message she sent. We do not need to know your exact location with triangulation, only its location of ""rough"" form is enough. It goes something like this: 

You send a Text Message for a number to be defined (eg 9990) 


The operator does his magic and discovers his triangulation and send to Car Helper servers your approximate location. 


The Car Helper servers process our location and locate 5 automotive rescuers near of you and sends these 5 phone numbers back to the operator. 


The operator sends the message containing the numbers for your phone. 


You call, ask for help and done: D 


Car Helper helped you. You must now be happy, The people of automotive rescuer is now happy, i am happy, and everybody is happy :D

All of these steps above, hopefully they are done super fast.And if you have no phone signal or internet? Well, we are sincere to you. We do not know how to solve this problem. If you do not have any phone signal or internet, there is nothing we can do. You will have to walk until you find phone signal.  :(Maybe later we can launch the ""Car Helper Pigeon Rescue"" ;)What We Need & What You Get
Your very help ... As you may have read above, all this requires technology . A lots of technology. All this costs resources. And we have no resources. Even worse, we live in Brazil, where everything costs lots of money. But we're creative (my girlfriend and I), we are excited and believe in our idea. We want our idea help people. We need computers, rent servers, some programmers to help to code the mobile systems, web and desktop and so on. We need to translate all the system from the most common languages in the world, etc. It's a lot of work.How Much it will cost to people/users? Nothing, applications are be free for smartphones and tablets.  :DHow Much it will cost for the Helpers? Only $ 150.00 / year. Just do the math. $150 / 365 day = $0,410  a day. Very cheap right?How Moch to sending messages for help? We do not know yet, but we believe that will have the same value as a regular text message.The ImpactWe strongly believe that the impact of our idea is very good. You don't need be stuck in a insurance plan for know if where you are have a automotive rescuer when you need one.Our app do this for you for free.Who has not stood in the road waiting for help, do not imagine how bad it is. You stand there, standing with his family or sometimes alone. It takes hours to pass anyone so you can ask for help. We want to reduce this time with the Car Helper.Take a look We have already started the Car Helper, we have developed a basic website and also basic mobile and web applications. However they are far from ideal, precisely because we do not have resources to invest in the total development of the Car Helper. Feel free to visit the Car Helper. We have two domains: International: http://www.carhelper.co/ The Brazilian one: http://www.carhelper.com.br/ There you can also see and download our app for iOS and Android.They are in Portuguese.How your money will be spent:The values are in Real (BRL). In Dollar is about: US$25.085,66 based on value of day 22/05/2014  (R$2.2121 per US$ 1,00)In Equipment:Other Ways You Can HelpYou may just can’t contribute. It's ok, but that doesn’t mean you can’t help right?

Licentiated in Arts with honors in sculpture by the UCM University.
All his work pretends to create a definitive bridge between present art and the art of all times.
In achieving all these, Jordi has developed an original sculptoric technique based in the utilization of electrosoldering elements made out of steel.
His background allowed the most fine mastery in manufacturing chassis and all metal pieces.

<p><b>How does uCella prevent grab &amp; run type of theft activities?</b></p>
<p>The outer shield is made of strong, durable composite materials with inserts. It is definitely not something porch pirates can easily cut or tear open, grab and run. The metal chassis and framing are also very rigid. In addition, uCella has a smart locking system and cameras to keep your packages safe. Our missions is to create a smart, good looking, easy to use and very protective product. All of its features will work together seamlessly to give you peace of mind.</p>
<p><b>How would the delivery driver know to use uCella?</b></p>
<p> When we designed the product, we talked to many delivery drivers to make sure it is easy for them to operate. Actually, delivery drivers hate to leave packages by your doors step because they are liable for missing packages. During our field test, we placed a small sticker above our device to give drivers instructions on how to operation. They had no problem following them and after couple deliveries, they just go right to it. We will provide the sticker with every uCella device. After couple deliveries, they just go right to uCella and use it for the delivery. Here is the sticker we used during our field test-</p>

<p>When you make online purchases, online retailers send you order confirmation receipts and shipping notification emails with tracking numbers. uCella automatically processes these emails to find the tracking numbers and sync them to your uCella devices as unlocking pass codes. You will be informed about the package status from order to delivery. In addition, all of the orders are kept in one view so you can easily search for previously purchased products and also have easy access to retailers’ customer support information from the app.</p>
<p><b>What kind of email accounts can I link with my uCella account? </b></p>
<p>For the initial release, we will support Gmail, Outlook (Hotmail) and Yahoo accounts. In the future, we will add other email providers support based on our user feedbacks.</p>
<p><b>How can I return online purchased products?</b></p>
<p>When you want to return online purchased products, you may need to first call or email the online retailer to notify them about the return and request for a return shipment label. Once you have the label, you can use your uCella app to request for a pickup by the designated shipment carrier (USPS and UPS). On the scheduled pickup day, uCella app will remind you to place the pre-labeled return package in the uCella device.</p>
<p>* Depends on the shipment type and carrier policy, some may charge a fee for the pickup.</p>
<p>* The initial release offers pre-labeled package pickup request feature only. We will partner with major online retailers to streamline the return process and also consider to add advanced shipping functionalities in the future.</p>
<p><b>Who can unlock my uCella?</b></p>
<p>Only those who have the passcodes. There are two types of passcodes-master passcode and shipment passcode. All uCella users have to setup their own master passcodes to unlock the devices linked to their uCella accounts. Shipment passcodes are tracking numbers provided by online retailers via online order emails or manually entered by uCella users. A used shipment passcode automatically expires to prevent repeat usage.</p>
<p><b>Can I use uCella as a mailbox?</b></p>
<p>uCella does have a mail slot on the front panel but technically uCella is not a typical USPS mailbox. We want uCella to be a shared resource for all carriers.</p>
<p><b>Can multiple users use the same uCella?</b></p>
<p>Absolutely! Users need to setup their individual uCella App accounts and simply add the device to their accounts. They will be able to manage their own shopping order lists via the mobile App but share the same uCella to handle physical packages. A user can also link multiple uCella devices in the same account. This feature is perfect for vacation home owners.</p>
<p><b>Is it difficult to install uCella?</b></p>
<p>Installing uCella is easy. The electronic part of the device runs on battery so no wiring is needed.It will come with a wall mount template to help you install uCella at the right place.</p>
<p><b>How long will the battery last?</b></p>
<p>uCella has an embedded battery as well as a removable/rechargeable battery. A fully charged removable battery will last for around 4 weeks. When the power is below 20%, uCella will send you push notifications to remind you that the battery needs to be recharged. While you are charging the removable battery, uCella can stay alive for 2-3 days thanks to the embedded battery.</p>
<p><b>What is the Warranty?</b></p>
<p>We provide a one (1) year limited warranty.</p>
<p><b>How much is shipping and handling?</b></p>
<p>FREE in the Domestic United States</p>
<p><b>Where can uCella be shipped?</b></p>
<p>We will ship only to the US for this crowdfunding campaign. In the future, we will rollout uCella to other countries worldwide.</p>

<p> I will use my

local developers, city planners, and public officials to gain feedback and
build support for my Inter-City Auto Train service proposal. I will also work
on compiling a list of attractions and places of interest within 200 miles of
the train station. I also hope to take detailed photographs and measurements of
areas around the station to accurately map out possible station re-designs.
 </p>
<p><b></b></p><b>
</b><p><b><span>What is your MTP project designed to accomplish?</span></b></p>
<p>What my project is designed to accomplish is to build
contacts and collect information and feedback about people’s interest in and
desire for Inter-City Auto Train Service. I also hope to document and plan
possible station sties. I am hoping to build local partnerships with people and
business interested in bringing this service to the cities. At the end of the
project I plan to have enough information to create a business plan for this
service on the route traveled during the project.  </p>
<p><b>How does your project differ from other projects in your
sphere?</b></p>
<p>Auto Trains have
existed in some form for over 50 years. They have ranged in form from the shuttle
trains that run through the Channel Tunnel, where passengers drive their cars
directly onto the train and stay with their vehicle, to the Style of the
Current Amtrak Auto Train, where large numbers of cars are loaded onto
Autoracks and passengers ride into regular rail cars. No other project I have
found in my research does what mine does, created a multiple-stop long distance
Auto Train service. This project is also unique because it transforms train
stations into setups closer to modern airports. The new Inter-city Auto train
stations have lounge spaces, recreation areas, food options, and other
activities for travelers while they are waiting for their train. Most other
passenger train projects focus on the stations more as places integrated with
other destinations as opposed to destinations themselves. </p>
<p><b>What do you plan to
create as a result of your MTP journey, and by when?</b></p>
<p>After the MTP journey
is over I plan to create a detailed as possible service and business plan for
Inter-City Auto Train Service on the route travelled by the MTP journey. This
plan will include service frequency, ticket costs, and designated
loading/unloading stops, as well as ideas for station redesigned to accommodate
this new service. In addition I will use information collected on this trip to
include estimated implementation costs of the system, particularly station
re-designs. I will complete this task no later than October 15th 2016.  </p>
<p><b>How will you share the
impact of your project and MTP experience with others?</b></p>
<p>Before the MTP begins
I will have a website about my inter-city auto train project, and I will be
updating this website during the trip. I will have also created promotional
materials including videos as part of my school project. I also plan on using
what I learn and gather during the journey to create additional promotional
materials. After the completion of the MTP I hope to use what I have learned
long with the rest of the work I have completed my project to present my
service to Amtrak. </p><p></p><div>

What we do have is the first app just for cosplay, and with your help we can make it a lot better.</p>
<b>Do a lot of people use Cosplace right now?</b> We currently have several hundred users and regular daily activity. They've provided some amazing feedback and we're ready to build the next version. People are definitely excited.<div>

<p><b>How much do you need? </b>We're raising $25,000, which will cover the next MVPs for iPhone and Android.</p>
<p><b>What the heck is an MVP?</b> An MVP in the app development world stands for Minimum Viable Product. It's how Instagram started, and pretty much every app on your phone. MVP one is the most basic version, and then it keeps improving with a each new version (MVP). While apps eventually stop becoming MVPs, they are never finished. They evolve and improve over time. After all, Instagram is five years old. Do you remember it back in 2010? We do. It was pretty basic back then, too. </p>
<p><b>UH I don't get it why can't it be perfect immediately?</b> Well, perfection is expensive. But think about it another way: was your first costume perfect? Probably not. It was really basic and had some issues but each costume go better and better until it reached breath taking level, right? Well, same goes for apps. We'll get to breath taking level wit your help.</p>
<p><b>Didn't I JUST see you on that other crowdfunding site?</b> Yes, we launched a Kickstarter and quickly realized we made a few mistakes and decided to reboot quickly. We've cancelled that project and moved to Indiegogo with a more manageable goal, and a flexible funding model so we'll get to keep what we raise.</p>
<p><b>If you don't reach your goal, is Cosplace dead like Jon Snow? </b>Jon Snow is not dead, and nor will Cosplace be. The app has been self-funded by our founder so far, and he will continue to do so. We can just go faster with your help.</p>
<p><b>Awesome! Can I see more of Cosplace now?</b> Yes, see the gallery below of mockups for the next version, and if you're on an iPhone, you can download Cosplace 1.1 now for free.</p>

</div></div>","What is Cosplace? Cosplace is the first mobile photo sharing app made just for the cosplay community.What are you raising money for? We're raising money to upgrade our current version for iPhone, and to build our much-requested Android version of Cosplace.Above picture: Designs for the next Cosplace for iPhone and Android.
What have you done so far? We released Cosplace 1.0 for iPhone in January, and an update earlier this Spring. You can get our iPhone version for free right now!


Cosplace 1.1 for iPhone is now available for free on the app store

Is Cosplace like Instagram? It does have similar characteristics. But Cosplace is currently in beta and does not have some of the bells ad whistles you might be used to on Instagram. What we do have is the first app just for cosplay, and with your help we can make it a lot better.
Do a lot of people use Cosplace right now? We currently have several hundred users and regular daily activity. They've provided some amazing feedback and we're ready to build the next version. People are definitely excited.
What about Yaya Han? Yes, she likes us! She let us create some custom mockups too!



What can you do in Cosplace? Share photos of your cosplays at conventions, in the studio. You can even share your works in progress. We have our own Workshop category! Hooray process! You can also like and comment on other posts as well.
How much do you need? We're raising $25,000, which will cover the next MVPs for iPhone and Android.
What the heck is an MVP? An MVP in the app development world stands for Minimum Viable Product. It's how Instagram started, and pretty much every app on your phone. MVP one is the most basic version, and then it keeps improving with a each new version (MVP). While apps eventually stop becoming MVPs, they are never finished. They evolve and improve over time. After all, Instagram is five years old. Do you remember it back in 2010? We do. It was pretty basic back then, too. 
UH I don't get it why can't it be perfect immediately? Well, perfection is expensive. But think about it another way: was your first costume perfect? Probably not. It was really basic and had some issues but each costume go better and better until it reached breath taking level, right? Well, same goes for apps. We'll get to breath taking level wit your help.
Didn't I JUST see you on that other crowdfunding site? Yes, we launched a Kickstarter and quickly realized we made a few mistakes and decided to reboot quickly. We've cancelled that project and moved to Indiegogo with a more manageable goal, and a flexible funding model so we'll get to keep what we raise.
If you don't reach your goal, is Cosplace dead like Jon Snow? Jon Snow is not dead, and nor will Cosplace be. The app has been self-funded by our founder so far, and he will continue to do so. We can just go faster with your help.
Awesome! Can I see more of Cosplace now? Yes, see the gallery below of mockups for the next version, and if you're on an iPhone, you can download Cosplace 1.1 now for free.

<div>Last summer was the debut of our <a href=""http://firststatescycling.org/events/ft-washington/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Battle for Fort Washington</a> road cycling training race and clinic series, just outside Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Each of the three nights over 75 riders came out, a quarter of them beginners and another quarter women. It was one of the most fun competitive cycling events in the region, and has great promise going forward to keep recruiting and developing new racers from all ages and genders.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>This year we're making it free.</b> The <a href=""http://qcwcycling.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">QCW Cycling</a> club has already committed to covering the fixed costs---EMTs, officials, permits, etc.---and ensuring this event happens not just this year, but next year as well. World class coaches from <a href=""http://breakawaybikes.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Breakaway Bikes</a> are once again volunteering to lead the coached riding, clinics, and skills drills. We also expect the <a href=""http://www.pacycling.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pennsylvania Cycling Association</a> to support the event again this year. But we need to defray the per-rider insurance costs, and to do that we're calling on you and the whole community to make it happen.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The series itself is coming up fast now, Wednesday evenings on July 8, 15, and 22nd. Full details are available from the <a href=""http://firststatescycling.org/events/ft-washington/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">First States Cycling Association</a> website, and updates go to the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/firststates"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">First States Facebook page</a>. We'll see you there!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435153645/ooig7umrkd6ap0dxjjzp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<h3>Costs</h3>
<div>Compared to many events, this series is inexpensive to run. <a href=""http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/findapark/fortwashington/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fort Washington State Park</a> charges comparatively very small and completely reasonable fees to occupy the entire park each evening. Our other big fixed cost is professional EMTs, which we think are important to have on site for any competitive cycling event. Those and our other fixed costs are all covered.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>But, each participant costs about $4 per night. Almost all of that ($3.60) goes to <a href=""http://www.usacycling.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">USA Cycling</a> for necessary event insurance. Then there's minor costs for race numbers and waivers. Last year we had a nominal $5 registration fee to cover that.</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>Just Ride</h3>
<div>This year we're not going to run any registration, for a couple reasons. One is simply that for such a low fee, it's unfortunate to incur the hassle of requiring all the participants to register online (we can't take registration money in the park). A substantial portion of the fees also then just go straight to the registrar website. Working registration is also the most stressful role for the volunteers running the event, trying to process everybody as quickly as possible in the tight interval between riders arriving from work and the event starting. Without registration fees, racers can just roll up, flash a license, and then jump into the event.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Beyond that, registration fees are just another barrier. All our participants need to have a <a href=""http://www.usacycling.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">USA Cycling</a> license to meet insurance requirements. That costs $15 for a day, or $70 for the year. A totally new racer who just wants to give it a try one night is looking at a $20 event. If we can eliminate the $5 registration, then we've chopped off a quarter of that and made it even more likely for them to come.</div>

</div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<div>That said, we still need to cover the per-rider costs. In the long run it's not sustainable to keep putting those solely on our primary supporting organizations. So we're running this campaign to have the entire community contribute, from other organizations and clubs down to individuals.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>For the racers already planning on coming out to the series, we hope you'll join in making it happen. If you can pitch in more than your costs, you'll be helping to bring in other riders still unsure about racing or more constrained.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>For everybody else, we hope you will also support the series. It benefits all of us to have an organized, safe, fun event like this exposing new riders to competitive cycling, and creating a great space for women and men to race together. Even if you're not yourself interested in racing or you simply can't make it to these events yourself, it helps everybody to have clinics and educational efforts like this creating stronger, safer, better cyclists.</div>

<h3>Modular</h3>
<p align=""justify"">We do not want to build throwaway products. It is therefore an essential part of our philosophy to make the modularity of the scooters accessible for you. This means that when, for example, different battery technology becomes available, you will be able to integrate it into your scooter and modernize it. This way you can stay up to date.</p>
<h3>Open Source</h3>
<p align=""justify"">By using open source components we ensure that our e-scooters are easy to repair and spare parts are available and cheap. We make it simple.</p>
<h3>The Importance of Modularity and Open Source Standards</h3>
<p align=""justify"">We want to make everything as easy and accessible as possible. This ensures that the e-scooters are easy to repair and to update and therefore contribute a great deal to the convenience of the customer.</p>
<p align=""justify"">This is already awesome but sincerely we are aiming further than this: the accessible modularity of the e-scooters make this project more sustainable because the vehicle does NOT become useless as soon as there is new technology available or a part is broken etc..</p>

For us that’s the point of being human. We can abstract, we can imagine, we can create and we can change.<br/>In nowadays cities many of us are struggling with space issues, a shortage of parking places, with stressful noise and sickening pollution. We want to remind the people of their power to make decisions and transform our cities and environments. We have many different opportunities to do so. Bringing electric mobility to the people is one them. Electric scooters are a fast and easy way to push electric mobility. One who has experienced the pleasure of electric driving won’t go back so easily. It’s fun, it’s silent, it doesn’t stink, it feels lightweight and the acceleration is awesome.<br/>We believe in this change.</p><p><b>Our vision: A world in which modular electric scooters are daily routine.</b></p><p align=""justify"">On our platform people can find new ways of mobility and share their e-scooter stories. They can charge their scooters with solar power during office time and listen to music at the lake in the evening under soft and warm fairy lights – all powered by their e-scooters. Everyone can spot their scooter from far away because they all look different. At the same time, many parts are interchangeable.<br/>The cities are quiet, there is just the soft buzzing of agile electric scooters, the sound of people walking on firm asphalt, talking to each other and some music from the inside of a café nearby. People leave their homes to enjoy their environment. Weather apps let them be prepared for the upcoming weather. They sit in cafes eating cake from the money they saved from not having to buy gasoline. Many of those people would have taken the car if there hadn't been this opportunity. Now they wouldn't want to swap this feeling of fresh air and smoothness against the never ending search for parking space, traffic jams and petrol bills. Cars are mostly registered in winter now and are parked at parking lots at the city boundaries. In the city centre, where there used to be cars all over the place, there are now parks and people sitting in the sun, comfortably reclaiming their space to live.</p><p> </p><h2>Our Story</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1534770711/tha2o2mpfurxsi09drei.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p align=""justify"">Growing up at the Baltic Sea near Rostock, Jasper – the founder of SCOOTERRA – now lives with his family in Marburg, a small town in the middle of Germany. There, him and his daughter got asthma. The number of respiratory diseases in Germany is vastly increasing, because efforts to enforce renewable energies and electric mobility are being repeatedly slowed down from several directions.</p><p align=""justify"">With SCOOTERRA, Jasper has developed a concept that can provide cities with an easy and quick solution to problems of air pollution, congestion, parking shortage and noise.

<p align=""justify"">They are a solution for the space and environmental problems that we are struggling with in our cities. Beside the great options of different e-bikes, we think that people need e-scooters to have an option, where it is possible to ride together on one vehicle and enjoy the acceleration of the electric engine. This is brisk and smooth driving at the same time. We just love it.</p></details><details style=""margin:1em 0;""><summary style=""display: list-item;padding:1em 1em 1em 1.25em;line-height: 1.2em;cursor: pointer;background:#cfcfcf;color: #000;""> The price is very low for an e-scooter with such a powerful motor and long reach. Why is that? </summary><p align=""justify"">It is a crucial part of our mission to make e-mobility accessible and attractive for everyone. This meant we had to combine cheap price with great performance. To achieve this we use only parts that already exist on the market while making sure to use the best possible option for every part. We use open standard components which ensure a reliable and cheap supply of spare parts. Because we want e-mobility to be simple, cool and fun.</p></details><details style=""margin:1em 0;""><summary style=""display: list-item;padding:1em 1em 1em 1.25em;line-height: 1.2em;cursor: pointer;background:#cfcfcf;color: #000;""> How can I get the offer of 1 Euro a day? </summary><p align=""justify"">It is essential for us that everyone can afford fun electric mobility!</p>

Like this we want to start a movement and remind people of their power to chose what is best for them. 1 Euro a DayWe want that everyone can afford a cool, fun and worthwhile means of transportation. Therefore we want to offer installments from 30 € a month, that is 1 € a day. Just like buying a new mobile phone.Please check our FAQ for more detailed information.   
 
 




 
A Solution that is Fun!
A platform that makes awesome e-scooters affordable for everyone is the perfect way to combine the protection of this awesome planet with fun and lifestyle. The problems caused by traffic like lack of space, congestion, parking issues, stressful noise, harmful air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions – electric scooters can contribute so much to solving all of these problems. Let's make this happen.

    Strong and simple: SCOOTERRA ONE The scooter comes with three different power modi:
25 km/h panorama mode
city mode
full 3 kW motor power mode for steep routes


 
Modular
We do not want to build throwaway products. It is therefore an essential part of our philosophy to make the modularity of the scooters accessible for you. This means that when, for example, different battery technology becomes available, you will be able to integrate it into your scooter and modernize it. This way you can stay up to date.
Open Source
By using open source components we ensure that our e-scooters are easy to repair and spare parts are available and cheap. We make it simple.
The Importance of Modularity and Open Source Standards
We want to make everything as easy and accessible as possible. This ensures that the e-scooters are easy to repair and to update and therefore contribute a great deal to the convenience of the customer.
This is already awesome but sincerely we are aiming further than this: the accessible modularity of the e-scooters make this project more sustainable because the vehicle does NOT become useless as soon as there is new technology available or a part is broken etc..


 
 
 
 
 



 
  A Business made to go with Time
We want to build a company that is able to respond to changes, whether in terms of technical possibilities or the needs of the drivers. It's important to build flexible businesses – after all, the lack of flexibility of companies is something that put us in this precarious situation that we and/ or our offspring will find ourselves in. We want to always strive for the best solution and never hold on to something that does not comply with the current opportunities regarding sustainability. Part of this philosophy is aiming at different solutions for the body of the e-scooters. We want to offer bodies that are made from ecological materials asap, for example using biodegradable plastics in 3D printing. Those bodies again shall fit the current frame. This is how modularity and open standards can contribute to customer convenience and sustainability at the same time. We are really looking forward to savoring the possibilities and hope that we get as much support as possible and as soon as possible in order to get involved in this area and re-deal the cards. The linchpin of the power to change the market are the sales figures and the support we get.

Everyone can spot their scooter from far away because they all look different. At the same time, many parts are interchangeable.The cities are quiet, there is just the soft buzzing of agile electric scooters, the sound of people walking on firm asphalt, talking to each other and some music from the inside of a café nearby. People leave their homes to enjoy their environment. Weather apps let them be prepared for the upcoming weather. They sit in cafes eating cake from the money they saved from not having to buy gasoline. Many of those people would have taken the car if there hadn't been this opportunity. Now they wouldn't want to swap this feeling of fresh air and smoothness against the never ending search for parking space, traffic jams and petrol bills. Cars are mostly registered in winter now and are parked at parking lots at the city boundaries. In the city centre, where there used to be cars all over the place, there are now parks and people sitting in the sun, comfortably reclaiming their space to live. Our StoryGrowing up at the Baltic Sea near Rostock, Jasper – the founder of SCOOTERRA – now lives with his family in Marburg, a small town in the middle of Germany. There, him and his daughter got asthma. The number of respiratory diseases in Germany is vastly increasing, because efforts to enforce renewable energies and electric mobility are being repeatedly slowed down from several directions.With SCOOTERRA, Jasper has developed a concept that can provide cities with an easy and quick solution to problems of air pollution, congestion, parking shortage and noise. He is convinced that this is a most effective way to improve the lives of individuals and maintain our environment. The TeamBehind this project we stand, three friends from quite different directions. We share the courage to think big ideas and the enthusiasm to learn to realize them. And we really love to drive electric scooters. 
Jasper Häger has always been passionate about technology. From a very young age, he had the opportunity to work on mopeds and cars. In the rural area where he grew up he was able to test them quite early. In the 1990s, he followed the beginnings of renewable energy, and since then, he has been constantly learning about the latest opportunities and policy developments in this field. It was the same with electric mobility. SCOOTERRA is the means by which he wants to concentrate all his knowledge and create a movement that can change the lives of many people.

We have worked in close contact with our producer in China to create this awesome e-scooter. We have everything set to ship your SCOOTERRA ONE to your location in spring next year. Now we need you to make this happen. Why e-scooters? E-scooters can change your everyday life and improve our cities!
They are a solution for the space and environmental problems that we are struggling with in our cities. Beside the great options of different e-bikes, we think that people need e-scooters to have an option, where it is possible to ride together on one vehicle and enjoy the acceleration of the electric engine. This is brisk and smooth driving at the same time. We just love it. The price is very low for an e-scooter with such a powerful motor and long reach. Why is that? It is a crucial part of our mission to make e-mobility accessible and attractive for everyone. This meant we had to combine cheap price with great performance. To achieve this we use only parts that already exist on the market while making sure to use the best possible option for every part. We use open standard components which ensure a reliable and cheap supply of spare parts. Because we want e-mobility to be simple, cool and fun. How can I get the offer of 1 Euro a day? It is essential for us that everyone can afford fun electric mobility!
In our future shop the option of paying by installments will be integrated in the order transaction. Different rates will be possible including the option of 30 Euro per month which is 1 Euro a day.
To make use of the financing option choose one of our perks for reservation of a SCOOTERRA ONE in the campaign. Within the next 4 weeks after the end of the campaign you will be forwarded an e-mail with information on the next steps towards the best financing option for you.In cooperation with SMAVA, we can already offer this financing option in Germany. We are working on realizing this option in other countries, too. Are there any subsidies for purchasing an e-scooter? Yes, there are a lot! Be sure to look up all the awesome offers from cities and countries who subsidise the purchase of an electric vehicle. The subsidies range between 150 and 1500 EUR for an electric scooter so it's definitely worth to check it out. On our homepage you can already find links to many of these programs, most of them in Germany. We are working on expanding this list of subsidy programs in different countries. We also want to encourage you to send us links with information on subsidies we can add to our list. What's the Early Bird membership that you mention in your perks?Every backer who preorders a SCOOTERRA ONE in this campaign will get an Early Bird membership. You are making this happen. We will be happy to offer you little gifts from time to time in our future shop. Be prepared. Do you ship outside of Europe? We will be able to deliver to locations outside of Europe as soon as there is the miminum amount of 30 orders per country. If at the end of the campaign there are less then 30 orders placed from your country (outside of Europe), you can choose to either get 70% percent of your contribution back or let us use your contribution for the realisation of the project. To minimize your risk, we advice people from countries outside of Europe to preorder SCOOTERRA ONE by doing an advance payment of 100 EUR via the campaign (instead of higher payments or full price). Can SCOOTERRA ONE go faster than 45km/h? Yes. In Europe we have a speed limit of 45km/h for this kind of scooter but we can program SCOOTERRA ONE to go faster and adjust it to the speed for the regulations in Canada, the US or elsewhere. Are the costs for delivery included? For Germany, yes. If you live outside from Germany you are responsible for taxes and additional transportation costs to your location. The more vehicles will be ordered to your country, the lower the transportation costs will be. Currently we estimate the delivery costs to be between 100 and 200 EUR for Europe. We can also ship to other countries and also to different continents in case there is a minimum amount of 30 orders made. We ship Canada and the US directly from our production site in China to keep the tax and transportation cost as low as possible. Do you do refunds? In case that we are not able to deliver your SCOOTERRA ONE to your location due to any legal restrictions on the import or delivery of your e-scooter, we shall refund you 70% of the amount of your contribution. Please make sure whether it is legal to import, deliver, and operate SCOOTERRA ONE in your country in advance. Does SCOOTERRA ONE come in different colors? Yes. Principally every color and pattern is possible, even customization. How many colors we will be able to offer you to choose from, depends on how much support we get now. If you have a special request, let us know and we will see what we can do. :) Will specifications change after the campaign? We are still optimizing SCOOTERRA ONE to create the best electric scooter that you can find. Some parts might be replaced by more suitable and better options in order to meet this goal. Transparency with our features is very important to us because we know that this is essential for every customer. Is it really true I can get up to 100 km on a single charge? Yes. On average, you can reach 100km with a single charge. The reach however strongly depends on the driving style, weight and degree of the roads you usually take. Do I need a license to drive SCOOTERRA ONE? Yes you do. The scooters are 45 km/h fast. In Europe you need a type AM drivers license for scooters or a type B for cars. (Type B includes type AM) Check your countries provisions to find out, what kind of drivers license you need to ride a scooter. Who is responsible for any additional taxes, duties or VAT/GST? If you live in an European country the taxes are already included in the price. If you live outside of the European Union you are responsible for additional taxes. Please check the different regulation for your country. How long is the life cycle of your batteries? After 1000 times charging, which is approximately 100.000km, the capacity still is at 90%. How long is the battery charging time? It takes about 2-3 hours to charge one battery. A 10 Ah charger is included into the price. What kind of accessories do you currently have or can I expect in the near future? We plan to open our online shop in spring 2019. We will offer all spare parts for the scooters. Bit by bit we will also offer several accessories with which you can modify your individual scooter. This will include different seats, mirrors, shock absorbers, luggage racks etc.. Where can I repair the scooters? Our e-scooters have a simple construction and we use standardized parts. Because of this, it will be easy for you to get cheap spare parts and you can adress every workshop. We will start listing the workshops that have experience with our e-scooters. Currently, we are setting up a network of workshops who have experience with electric scooters. As many parts will be easy to replace and repair, we want to do DIY tutorials. Can I order multiple scooters for my company? Yes you can. Please contact us via crowd@scooterra.eu I live in Germany. Can I pick it up myself? Yes you can. Please contact us via crowd@scooterra.eu with the subject „PICKUP“ How to contact SCOOTERRA? Contact us via mail: crowd@scooterra.eu or find us at  www.scooterra.eu. Do you offer a guarantee? What‘s your warranty? There's a two years warranty on SCOOTERRA ONE. We will offer all necessary spare parts in order to repair the vehicle if needed. It is not possible for us to provide a guarantee for SCOOTERRA ONE at this early stage of our company. What is your returns-policy? Within 14 days after the arrival of your ordered scooter you can return it without any explanation of reasons. For the transport costs you have to pay yourself.",19.0,0,"1 Campaign

We like to do things the right way, which sometimes is not necessarily the easiest way. That is why we designed our own e-bikes with unique features that are best suited for e-biking, which you do not find on most of our competitors in the market. Features that you might find being adopted a few years down the road by other brands.  We pride ourselves as being the market leader on innovations. That’s the way we like to keep it.Our first campaign with our patented e-bike was a great success. Unfortunately the success brought with it a lot of challenges. We got beaten down a lot, made too many mistakes to list, but we always learned and worked hard, and eventually we managed to tackle them all.

<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">About the Greybox</span></strong></p>
<p>A long time ago, when I was still in college, I designed and built this synthesizer: essentially, I gutted my old Nintendo Entertainment System, fitted the processor's sound hardware to MIDI via a microcontroller, and made of this a playable, usable, surprisingly versatile little chiptune synthesizer. I had plans to start a company around this project, but I ended up getting a job in Japan instead. The synthesizer itself was damaged in the move, and it languished in the closet for seven years.</p>
<p>Recently, I started my own company (Curious Violet) to make electronic musical instruments and effects. A friend pointed out that since I was so proud of having built the Greybox all those years ago, I should dig the project out, start manufacturing them, and give other chiptune lovers a chance to have a Greybox.</p>
<p>So what, exactly, can a Greybox do? Well, here are the...</p>
<h3>Specifications</h3>
<p><strong>DIMENSIONS: </strong>88mm (height), 482.6mm (width), 200mm (depth)</p>
<p><strong>INPUTS: </strong>MIDI IN, Control Voltage, Gate, Power (+9VDC, 800mA)</p>
<p><strong>OUTPUTS:</strong> Audio (mono, 1/4"" phone jack), MIDI OUT, MIDI THRU</p>
<p><strong>PATCH STORAGE:</strong> 128 patches for squarewave, 64 patches for triangle and noise.</p>
<p><strong>SAMPLE STORAGE:</strong> 32kB of delta-modulation samples</p>
<p><strong>STORAGE MEDIA: </strong>Internal memory, SD card</p>
<p><strong>FIRMWARE:</strong> Can be updated by SD card or via MIDI SYSEX.</p>
<p><strong>DISPLAY:</strong> 128x64 pixel, monochrome graphic LCD with backlight</p>
<p><strong>SOFTWARE:</strong> Includes a program to create and index patches, to convert samples into delta-modulation format, and to manage sample libraries/key mappings.</p>
<p> The Greybox is a rack-mount module and will fit into any standard 19"" rack with 2U of space available.</p>
<p>The playable sound channels are: two squarewaves, one triangle wave, one noise waveform, and one delta-modulation ""sample"" channel. Each of these can be controlled by a separate MIDI channel, or the keyboard can be ""split"" into ranges for each channel.</p>
<p>The parameters that can be adjusted are:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>SQUARE:</strong> Selectable duty cycle (25/50/75%), ADSTR envelope, portamento (on/off and speed), vibrato (on/off, speed and depth), frequency sweep (on/off, speed), envelope looping (on/off) and arpeggiator (on/off, speed).</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>TRIANGLE:</strong> Note length (T parameter of ADSTR envelope), portamento, vibrato and frequency sweep.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>NOISE:</strong> Noise type (short/long sequence), ADSTR envelope</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><strong>SAMPLE:</strong> Playback rate</p>
<p>In addition, the two squarewave channels can be combined for additional effects: chorus (on/off, semitone offset, amplitude) and phaser (on/off, phase separation).</p>
<p>A ""POLY"" switch on the front panel activates a limited 2-voice polyphony mode that allows both squarewave channels to be controlled by the same MIDI channel. In this mode, all ""effect"" settings are copied from Square 1 to Square 2, for consistency in sound.</p>
<p>Finally, although it is not strictly ""synthesis"" related, an audio player application allows playback of NSF files stored on the SD card.</p>
<h3>What We're Doing</h3>
<p>In addition to getting the Greybox out there and in the hands of enthusiasts, we are correcting a number of bugs and flaws in the original Greybox's implementation.

about order fulfillment
Here's the deal: The Greybox is going to get built. I'm building it right now. If this project does not meet its funding goals, everyone who orders a Greybox will still receive one.

En la columna de la derecha encontrarás diferentes opciones de financiación, en la que obtendrás diferentes recompensas según la cantidad aportada.Sigue leyendo y conoce más detalles de nuestro proyecto.¡Muchas gracias por tu colaboración!Diseño 3D de la nueva EME18-EQuiénes somos Somos UPM MotoStudent, una asociación sin ánimo de lucro formada por estudiantes de la Universidad Politécnica de Madrid.

Diseñamos y fabricamos motocicletas de carreras. Participamos en MotoStudent, competición internacional que se celebra en el circuito de Motorland.
En el año 2016 desarrollamos el primer prototipo eléctrico, la EME16-E, logrando la segunda posición en carrera. Actualmente estamos ultimando el desarrollo del nuevo prototipo, la EME18-E, buscando mejorar las prestaciones de nuestro anterior modelo
Entre nuestros objetivos están también fomentar el desarrollo de la movilidad eléctrica, crear conciencia sobre el desarrollo sostenible y apoyar la educación en ingeniería
Nos resulta imprescindible contar con tu ayuda: Con esta campaña buscamos obtener los fondos necesarios para el material con el que completar la fabricación nuestro prototipo, probar cada uno de los componentes y obtener los mejores resultados en la pista. ¡Necesitamos tu ayuda!La construcción de una moto de competición eléctrica es un proyecto muy ambicioso y que requiere una gran dedicación. Hemos diseñado, fabricado y comprado ya muchos de sus componentes y ahora necesitamos vuestra ayuda para terminar nuestra EME18-E.En la columna de la derecha puedes ver distintas cantidades para donar con la que obtendrás diferentes recompensas. Utilizaremos los fondos obtenidos para:
Fabricar y soldar el chasis
Comprar componentes eléctricos y mecánicos
Implementar un sistema de telemetría
Realizar test en circuito
¡Ir a Motorland a por todas!
Pero nuestro proyecto va más allá. Estamos convencidos de que es necesario un cambio hacia una sociedad más sostenible, y este proyecto es una gran manera de colaborar en la transición a la movilidad eléctrica y a la integración de formas de energía más respetuosas con el medio ambiente. La experiencia que adquirimos durante todos estos años es parte de nuestra formación como ingenieros, y lo que ahora es nuestra innovación será la realidad del mañana. ¿Qué obtienes a cambio?Como agradecimiento, todos los que colaboréis en nuestro proyecto podréis ver vuestro nombre sobre nuestra moto junto al del resto de colaboradores.Además, según la cantidad donada, recibirás diferentes obsequios como agradecimiento: una batería portátil, la equipación oficial del equipo o incluso un curso de moto en circuito con nuestra piloto Sara Román como monitora. ¡Échale un ojo al panel de recompensas de la derecha! Si prefieres cambiar alguna de las mismas o tienes alguna sugerencia, no dudes en contactar con nosotros.También estamos dispuestos a colaborar con entidades que decidan patrocinarnos: eventos, ferias, cursos… Si tienes una empresa o conoces a una que quiera contribuir con el proyecto ¡¡no dudes ni un momento en contactarnos a través de nuestra web, correo o redes sociales!! La técnica detrás de nuestra motoNuestra motocicleta es el equivalente a una categoría eléctrica de Moto3. Es nuestra intención convertirnos en un equipo referente en competición eléctrica.La competición en MotoStudent nos obliga a adaptarnos a su propio reglamento, lo que nos obliga a usar ciertos componentes a todos los equipos: motor, llantas, neumáticos, pinzas y bombas de freno.Nuestro primer modelo, la EME16-E fue todo un éxito, y desde entonces hemos introducido cambios con los que se ha notado una gran mejoría en las pruebas realizadas en en el circuito del Jarama:
Cambios en la gestión electrónica del motor
Modificación de las suspensiones
Perfeccionamiento de los reglajes por la experiencia adquirida en circuito.
Sistema de control de baterías de la EME16-EEl nuevo prototipo EME18-E parte de la experiencia adquirida durante los años anteriores y se ha buscado mejorar en todos los aspectos:
Importante reducción global del peso
Mejora en prestaciones y peso de la batería
Incorporación de un sistema de telemetría
Evolución en las suspensiones
Contará con el siguiente equipamiento:

color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">We started a company in March, 2011 called ideapiphany.  The goal of this company was to design and develop products for growing consumer market needs.  One of the areas we were interested in was the growing trend for urban commuters to utilize alternative forms of clean energy transportation to commute.</span></p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""border-collapse: collapse; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Because of increased congestion within most cities worldwide, and today's high cost of vehicle ownership, more and more commuters are utilizing public transportation to commute.  </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""border-collapse: collapse; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">This is not only a more convenient and cost effective way to travel, but it is also a much greener approach to commuting.</span></p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""border-collapse: collapse; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The one problem associated with using public transportation however is, how does one get to their final destination after getting off the train or bus?  This scenario is what is often referred to as the 'last mile'.  We decided this was an important enough problem to solve, so we launched a company called EgoLogical Mobility Solutions, and began to develop our first product, the URB-E.</span></p><p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""border-collapse: collapse;

font-size: 13px;""><font color=""#000000"">Although many commuters are utilizing bikes to address this need, it is not always easy or convenient to take a bicycle onto a packed train or bus during rush hour.  The other problem with bicycles is, in most cases, commuters leave their bikes locked on the street and risk vandalism and theft.  The URB-E solves this problem by being able to always stay with you.</font></p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""border-collapse: collapse;

It’s fast, maneuverable, and lightweight. With a 20-mile range on a full battery charge, it could work well for most city dwellers’ daily commutes. "" - The Verge The Today Show..............................................................................................................................................Awards..............................................................................................................................................The Ultimate 'Last Mile' VehicleIt takes only one second to convert the URB-E from something the size of carry on luggage to a 'go anywhere' personal e-vehicle!  Although there are other options for mobility devices such as bicycles and larger, more expensive e-vehicles on the market, it is not always possible to take these vehicles with you while traveling on a crowded train or bus during rush hour.  Because of its amazingly compact size and ability to stay with you while traveling on a train, bus, or trunk of your car, the URB-E makes for the perfect commuter companion.Other applications well suited for the URB-E include RV's, Boats, Private Aircraft, Universities, Corporate Campuses, Government Agencies, Resorts, and Tourism...............................................................................................................................................BLACK by URB-E..............................................................................................................................................The URB-E COMMUTER
The URB-E Commuter is the perfect vehicle for the highly congested urban environment.  Its three wheel trike design allows for added stability and greater lower speed maneuverability, perfect for navigating pedestrian traffic.  The two rear wheels also serve as a very stable way to roll the URB-E around while in its folded position, similar to pulling a piece of luggage.  Although the URB-E Commuter is capable of the same speeds as the GP (15mph), it is better suited for slower speed turns. (image shown with optional luggage rack accessory and bag) 






..............................................................................................................................................The URB-E GP
The URB-E GP is... well... let's just say... a LOT of fun!  Although this machine has the exact same power specifications as its more practical brother, the URB-E GP likes to live on the wild side.  The short wheel base of the GP's two wheel design gives it the agility of race car and a fun factor of 11 out of 10!  Unlike anything you've ridden before, the GP will bring you back to the way you felt when you first learned how to ride a bike!  Though it's a little more challenging than the URB-E Commuter at slower speeds, we're sure you won't be disappointed riding the coolest e-bike in town!

 This scenario is what is often referred to as the 'last mile'.  We decided this was an important enough problem to solve, so we launched a company called EgoLogical Mobility Solutions, and began to develop our first product, the URB-E.Although many commuters are utilizing bikes to address this need, it is not always easy or convenient to take a bicycle onto a packed train or bus during rush hour.  The other problem with bicycles is, in most cases, commuters leave their bikes locked on the street and risk vandalism and theft.  The URB-E solves this problem by being able to always stay with you.There are other e-vehicles currently on the market which are trying to address the last mile scenario, but none of them compare to the URB-E with how easy it is to ride, how compact and portable it is, and most are more expensive.We started designing the URB-E the end of 2012, and have built and extensively tested multiple prototypes in order to develop what we feel is the ultimate personal mobility device.  We were also able to partner with former lead engineer at Porsche, Sven Etzelsberger, to help us with the final engineering specs, so we like to say it has the same engineering DNA as Porsche!The URB-E is made from recyclable aircraft grade aluminum that has been machined to reduce all but the essential material for maximum weight reduction and reveal the iconic hole pattern, similar to how race cars and aircraft are built.URB-E has many beneficial features such as an integrated luggage rack, a patented folding mechanism and shock absorbing seat for an extremely comfortable ride, led lighting, and replaceable color sleeve inserts for creating a personalized look.  It also has an option to be a three wheel trike version for more stability in slower moving pedestrian traffic, or a more aggressive two wheel GP edition for a little more freedom and excitement.  There is also an integrated universal smart phone mount with custom App being developed to monitor the URB-E's speed, battery, range, and navigation, as well as being able to charge your phone and other devices with the integrated USB port.URB-E has teamed up with a production facility in Pasadena, CA called Foes Racing, and is ready to begin production early spring, 2014.  Foes makes hand made, high end downhill mountain bikes, so we are confident we will be delivering a very high quality product.Sounds of URB-E creation....................................................................................................................................................................Manufacturing & Timeline Our goal is to deliver the best product possible.  Our manufacturer is working on stress and durability testing to ensure a quality product.  Initial URB-E production will be made and assembled at our production facility located in Pasadena, California.  This allows us to personally inspect each component and test before delivering.The owner of our manufacturing facility is Brent Foes, a high-end mountain bike craftsman who hand makes mountain bikes for the hardcore racer and everyday rider.  Brent has been developing innovations for more than 20 years and has added his expertise and years of experience to the production of the URB-E.  We are thrilled to have this master craftsman help us produce these!  For more info on Foes, go to http://foesracing.com/bikes/We are working hard to deliver product for Summer 2014.  As mentioned, our initial production will begin in Pasadena, however the capacity of Foes is not suited for mass quantity.  Should we receive a large volume of orders, we do have a contingency plan in place with strategic production connections in Asia.  Our goal is to maintain a US made component to our product, so we have made sure we will be able to produce URB-E's as a collaboration between our Asia and US production facilities...............................................................................................................................................Why indiegogo?When we first decided to raise our startup capital through a crowdfunding campaign, we originally had planned to go with another site that starts with 'K' and ends in 'starter'.  : )  After receiving many accolades from our CES crash party (yes, we got kicked out after 4 hours for not having a booth, lol!), we had some trusted advisors ask us if we had considered using indiegogo instead?

The people who love riding bikes are always going to love it, hills and sweat and showers at work included."" ""The company is promising a product that disrupts at three levels: state-of-the-art technology, incredible performance, and drop-dead-gorgeous looks."" ""Electric bicycles aren’t new, but neither was the electric car when Tesla came along — and Zeitgeist thinks it can disrupt an industry, just as Tesla has. And it may be right."" Step on the pedals and get going to feel the motor kick on smoothly, as it boosts you through your natural cadence, quietly and smoothly. The Zeitgeist is your secret weapon on long, challenging endurance rides where you need a combination of exercise and comfort of knowing you have reserve power when you need it.Zero profile battery: The Zeitgeist's battery housing is a feat of great design. With nothing sticking out or open to theft and water damage, this bike blends into its environment seamlessly.Hidden in plain sight: The Zeitgeist motor is perfectly sized for its rear hub, tucking away behind the Shimano rear derailleur cassette. Barely in sight and out of mind.Built around the rider:  Whether you're commuting to work and errands, or going out for a recreational run, the Zeitgeist gives you a choice of ergonomics. Choose the flat bar for a more upright riding position (the Lightskin handlebar ""Perk"") or stick with the standard drop bar for a more aggressive, recreational riding stance.    The Zeitgeist R&D team has figured out a way to hide not only battery, battery management system (BMS) and the motor controller but also most of the electrical cabling. This clever cable routing makes the Zeitgeist frame water resistant and trouble-free. 5-STAR RATED SAFETY AND QUALITYAt Zeitgeist, we stand by our products, quality, and performance. Our bikes are 5-star rated by independent safely testing standards. Every frame is 1:1 tested for stiffness, sheer, quality defects, and strength.Zeitgeist frames come with a lifetime frame replacement warranty. All other drivetrain components are covered by our 2-year manufacturer's warranty to be free from defects and quality issues.  Zeitgeist is a global team of overachievers. Headquartered in Toronto, with offices in Seattle and Taiwan, our ethos is steeped in innovation and product design. We are privately funded and seeking growth capital from high net worth individuals and family offices to grow our global footprint.Zeitgeist is a factory-direct brand that sells via mobile commerce and pop-up showrooms in flagship locations. Following the example of Warby Parker and Casper, Zeitgeist promotes its bikes via influencers, its own racing club, and loyal customers. By recognizing that purchasing a high-end road bike is a drawn-out experience, and disrupting it, Zeitgeist’s business model is a game-changer in the channel-driven bike retail business. With pre-orders, strong unit economics and contribution margins, Zeitgeist will become profitable in Q3, 2018.Zeitgeist is an applicant for the 2018 Red Dot design awards to be presented this Summer in Essen, Germany.",35.0,0,"1 Campaign

We are launching this campaign to assist us with our interactive mobile fun ship the Clown Shoe AKA the Shoeburtymobile.</h3>
<div>The Clown Shoe is a very special carnival type of float.  It was built with much sentiment and love and we're giving our all to bring it to the festival this year. The story behind this vehicle goes back to a tragedy sadly, On May 30th of 2012 a deranged man walked into Cafe Racer a friendly neighborhood bar in our university district here in Seattle, he pulled out a gun and shot four people dead then ran off to kill one more person later and in the end he was killed as well. Two of those who died were friends of mine and beloved members of our community. They played whimsical lude songs with things like spoons up their noses or a sword swallowing act that'd make you laugh so hard you'd limp home afterwards. These were truly special folks and many of us miss them dearly. I created the Clown Shoe Vehicle as an homage to them Joe was a cobbler, and Drew was a sweet hearted first class smartypants, so a giant clown shoe just seemed so appropriate. Back when they were still alive I used to promise them that I'd take them to the burn one day, I'm now trying to keep that promise any way I can. </div>
<div>So what we're trying to do is combine a few things, add a bunch, and make some good improvements, we aim to make a lot of screaming smiles out there this year. Last year I built a flame effects rig for the front of our camp with a fellow artist James Reinhardt. It was called Cervantes and the Pyre'd Eye. It was interactive as on goers stopped they could turn a wheel and spin a giant flaming ring that would poof up as it spun faster. I've decided for this year to take those flame effects and mount them on our Mutant Vehicle the Clown Shoe. This will require quite a bit of transformation meaning electrical, plumbing for a high pressure system and of course a serious amount of fuel to run throughout the event. We are also adding two hundred lights to the exterior of the vehicle which will look like old fashioned carnival lights on the old time circus signs and the like. We really want to bring an authentic old world feeling to all of the participants this year, that means they get to push buttons making loud exciting poofs of fire and even some will get to play with flame throwers atop a crazy crowd of costumed burners, while the sounds of all sorts of wonders are filling the air, it's really a memory that stays with you forever. The Clown Shoe has come far recently but still has a ways to go, with your help and some hard work we will get it there with a full pack on board.</div>
<div>A little bit about myself. I started going to Burningman back in the 90's, in the years I've been I have always made it a priority to get on a build crew or to bring a build or a vehicle of my own creation. I've had more than a dozen registered floats or ""Mutant Vehicles"" registered at Burningman since then, and I'm not planning to slow down anytime soon. This rig though, this Clown Shoe, it hits me deeper than many of the others, just the eyes of those who knew our friends, and of course all of the newcomers and participants, it just makes my eyes water thinking about it all, and it's funny to me as I'm doing this and even shocking myself as I've been talking with old friends about all of this lately and they remind me of things I had made so long ago I had nearly forgotten them and then that rush of memories and smiles, so friggin good. So here I am again manifesting an idea, a hope that came from a wish and a dream, we've got the right team, we laugh and smile as we make, we have the support of our friends and community, for which we are grateful, and if you choose to join us in our quest I think you'll feel these same feelings I've been fortunate enough to. </div>
<div>There will also be some perks as we are a very thankful bunch of folks. For starters anyone who contributes will be invited to enjoy a number of different rewards. If you are planning to go to Burningman we'll be offering tours of installations, interactions with other artists in our communities, and a chance to shoot off some high powered flame effects, stuff like flaming walls, giant poofers, and even a gimbal mounted flamethrower! For those who cannot attend, fear not for we have other awesome rewards as well. Our crew is made up of artists, and fire acro performers, we'll be offering lessons on everything from poi, to staff, to hoop, fire breathing, wands and eating, and a whole bunch of other cool stuff like our one of a kind t shirts and hoodies and there's even more too! So give us a look a see what you think and thank you for looking and for anything you can do, and if you can't contribute monetarily we would still be thankful for any kind of promotion you can do, please share with your friends on social media and through word of mouth, we so very much appreciate all of it...

<p><strong>Is it just another electric Personal Vehicle? <br/>Why is it different?</strong><br/>It is a whole new personal transport experience, different from any personal vehicle or e-bike to date. In fact, we want you to think of it as a Personal Vehicle, not a ‘scooter.’ Current personal vehicle is expensive, clunky, hard to transport, hard to learn, many have quality issues and few are well-designed. </p>
<p>        •    Immotor GO’s transformative design allows it be used in three different states – Ride, Auto Pilot or Stand-By. It can be collapsed into its sleek self-contained case which can be pulled like a small suitcase. We mean it when we say fully portable – you can ride it and carry it with you on the train, bus, car or even the plane, then bring it inside with you wherever you end up. You don’t have to   worry about where to park it or whether it will be stolen. <br/>        •    The proprietary Immotor Super Battery in it is a revolutionary power source which has its own programmable operating system, guaranteeing performance and safety. The battery features its own ecosystem of compatible accessories – flashlight, lamp, AC/DC charger, USB charger, etc…<br/>        •    It is safe, stable, and easy to learn for kids and grown-ups alike, regardless of ability.<br/>        •    It has an innovative operating system created by Immotor, built with the future in mind. This is not just a typical display, but interactive and constantly updateable with any future software upgrades. Bluetooth connectivity, media functionality with speaker, GPS tracking, parental controls, cruise control, back-end data gathering and analysis are just a few of the many features available.</p>
<p><strong>How much does the Immotor GO weigh?</strong><br/>Currently, the Immotor GO weighs in at a lean 27 lbs (12 kg) with 2 batteries installed.</p>
<p><strong>How fast does Immotor GO go?</strong><br/>The Immotor GO’s speed is fully variable and comes in three pre-programmed speed modes – from a walking pace up to 20 MPH. </p>
<p><strong>How is the Immotor GO activated?</strong><br/>Each GO will come with a key fob paired to it. In addition, the Immotor App will allow your phone to be used as a digital key to unlock the GO and also allow you to grant access to friends that wish to use it via their smartphone app.</p>
<p><strong>How far can the Immotor GO travel on a charge?</strong><br/>It has a range of up to 20 miles (32 km) on a single charge depending on battery configuration and use.</p>
<p><strong>What powers the Immotor GO?</strong><br/>Immotor GO is powered by one or two 48-volt lithium-ion batteries and a 350 Watt brushless front hub.</p>
<p><strong>How do you recharge the Immotor GO?</strong><br/>It uses a charger that plugs into any standard 120-220 volt wall outlet and fully recharges in 3 to 4 hours. The batteries can also be removed and charged independently of the GO in a separate Dual Dock Charging Station.</p>
<p><strong>How long will the batteries last?</strong><br/>The Super Battery will last over 1000 cycles. The Immotor GO mobile app will notify the user that the battery needs to be replaced.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need a special license to operate an Immotor GO?</strong><br/>The Immotor GO is an “Electric Personal Assistive Mobility Device” (EPAMD) and each country, state and city has its own laws and restrictions. We strongly advise the use of safety equipment like helmets. Please review your local motor vehicle rules and laws.</p>
<p><strong>Is the Immotor GO easy to ride?</strong><br/>The Immotor GO stands on three wheels and is easily balanced even while at a stop. There is no learning curve and you will be enjoying the ride within seconds of stepping on. </p>
<p><strong>Can children ride an Immotor GO?</strong><br/>Yes! It is suitable for all ages from 6 to 106! The handlebars/controls telescope up and down to accommodate the user’s height.</p>
<p><strong>What is the Auto Pilot feature?</strong><br/>In this mode, you will be able to use the throttle to move the GO forward beside you or set cruise control and have the GO move unassisted. We are working on a future version of the GO where the cruise control feature would be tethered to your smartphone and would essentially just be able to follow you autonomously and serve as a convenient way to carry cargo for you. In the current product, this is not yet available.</p>
<p><strong>Does the Immotor GO come in different colors?</strong><br/>Currently the Immotor GO will only be offered in black for the first production run. New colors and combinations will be introduced in future iterations.</p>
<p><strong>Does the Immotor GO have a line of accessories?</strong><br/>The Immotor GO has an entire ecosystem of accessories available including LED lighting, smartphone dock, speaker, case/cover, horns/bells, cup holder, cargo net, etc…</p>
<p><strong>How does my smart phone work with my Immotor GO?</strong><br/>Bluetooth compatible devices will pair easily with the Immotor GO allowing for seamless connectivity and use of features. The Immotor GO’s smartphone dock will allow for easy access to view navigation apps and a USB connection to charge your devices. The GO will also be fully controllable via its proprietary GO mobile app – track your PV, lock/unlock, parental controls, etc…</p>
<p><strong>What is the data plan for?</strong><br/>We have a built in sim card inside of the product and will be activated upon delivery automatically. The data plan is used to transmit the location information of the Immotor GO using the GPS sensor to the Immotor App. With this location information, you can use your smartphone anywhere in the world to do the following:<br/> <br/>        •    Track your Immotor GO location information;<br/>        •     Lock it or unlock it;<br/>        •    Grant access to another smartphone user to use their phone as the wireless key to turn on the Immotor GO and ride;<br/>        •    Revoke other smartphone’s access to the Immotor GO;<br/>        •    Set up virtual fence for the Immotor GO so the product doesn’t function once it leaves a   pre-set perimeter.</p>
<p><strong>Does the Immotor GO include a data plan?</strong><br/>Yes – the first year of data coverage is included in the price. In the US, coverage will be provided by T-Mobile. Beyond the first year, the cost of renewing the data plan will be approximately $10/year and will be completely optional.</p>
<p><strong>Will the Immotor GO work without the data plan?</strong><br/>Of course, your Immotor GO will still function normally without the data plan, but it will just lack the remote tracking and control capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Will Immotor be tracking my device?</strong><br/>No. Location services and parental controls will be selective and controlled solely by the user. Immotor will only collect generic data related to performance and safety that will not be associated with specific user profiles.</p>
<p><strong>What is the weight capacity of the Immotor GO?</strong><br/>Our current model has the weight capacity of 300 lbs.<br/> <br/><strong>What’s a Super Battery?</strong><br/>A new “smart battery” with a built-in operating system that creates a handshake between the device and the battery, and ultimately with the consumer. It is a removable, independent power source with its own operating system and safety features which has the potential to become the modular power supply of a variety of larger electric devices. It can do many things beyond your imagination – through its own ecosystem of accessories, it can become a light, USB charger or AC/DC charger.</p>
<p><strong>How is the Super Battery different than other batteries available?</strong><br/>It is compact and light for the amount of power provided because it is lithium based.<br/>It is a modular system – you can take it out and use it different ways.<br/>It is very safe with protocols built in when not in use and when in use.<br/>It is intelligent – connected, programmable, interactive.</p>
<p><strong>What is a battery management system?</strong><br/>It's a system to allow and manage several batteries working together. They can work in series – adding more power; or in parallel – adding more time.<br/> <br/><strong>How much will it cost? </strong><br/>Retail pricing will be around $1199. Currently available on Indiegogo for $749 with accessories sold separately.<br/> <br/><strong>If the project is funded, when will it be shipped?</strong><br/>End of March to mid April 2017 will be the first shipment.<br/> <br/><strong>What are the odds it will be delivered? On time?</strong><br/>Excellent!<br/> <br/><strong>Will it ship world wide? </strong><br/>To most countries. Some countries will take more time because of certifications.<br/> <br/><strong>Can I distribute the product outside the USA?</strong><br/>Please email info@immotor.com for further information. <br/> <br/><strong>If I back the project early, what do I get?</strong><br/>A discounted price for supporting the effort and the product. Stay tuned and check back in for updated perks!<br/>  <br/><strong>What is the warranty on the Immotor GO? </strong><br/>Immotor GO comes with a one-year warranty from date of purchase</p>
<p><strong>Do I have to assemble my Immotor GO when I receive it?</strong><br/>No - there is no assembly required! After you unpack the product and fully charge the batteries, you insert the batteries, turn the power on and enjoy!</p>

Until today, biking has been less safe because of how difficult it is to know when cars are behind you on the road. By returning that one critical second to riders, we can change forever the way we bike, the way we move, and the way everyone moves - all around the world. If we can easily, clearly, and quickly see what is behind us on the road, we can prevent accidents. We’ll be safer, we’ll ride more often, and more people will join us, creating a ripple effect that can have a positive impact on our world. WHAT: We at Sehen have created a state of the art rear-view bike mirror that doesn’t vibrate, bringing you the steadiest, clearest view available. You'll be safer and have greater peace of mind while riding. We know you've never felt this safe before on the road and that you'll agree that Sehen offers the best way available to see the traffic around you. After checking out our project, we're sure you'll agree.   Ask yourself this question:When we ask riders this question, nine out of ten say they feel less safe mainly because of cars or something related to cars. We don't want riders to feel that cars are terrible monsters chasing them, eager to hurt them. If riders are able to see the cars around them, they can act accordingly, in harmony with traffic, rather than fighting against it. In the words of Sehen founder and inventor, Erik Borys:Many times a mistake creates a miracle. While I was playing with my children I found a piece of a toy that I managed to modify, and suddenly I had a bike mirror that was as steady as a car’s rear view mirror. It was incredible, and believe me when I say that if you're a rider you have never felt this feeling. The image was very precise, and I began to feel really safe riding my bike on the street - on any street - with or without bike lanes. When people saw my mirror - and sometimes used it - they asked me to make one for them.  And when my children grew up, I needed to make some mirrors for them, and because so many people had asked me, I began making them for everybody - and Sehen is this ""happy accident"" made real.  We applied for a patent, industrial design registration, and trademark in October 2015. After more than 25 working prototypes, materials, production systems, and plastic molds, we are ready to produce.  Riding has never felt like this feeling before. It's a combination of many things: the fresh air on your face, looking good, being aware enough to avoid traffic jams, doing good for yourself and for our world. All while saving money. It's feeling safe while seeing the world and the roads around you with confidence. A Sehen Story: ""A few weeks ago I gave my brother a Sehen. He told me he'd already used a helmet mirror before and that he couldn't focus the image. He thought it was because of the distance between his eyes and the mirror. I took him on a short ride, and he was simply amazed at the clear image he was getting in the Sehen.

 The most important part about Sehen is that it doesn't vibrate at all, showing you a very clear image that makes you feel incredibly safe and sure of what you are doing when riding your bicycle in the street.  The following comparison images were taken with exactly the same camera and methods.  It's difficult to feel safe due to the vibration of other mirrors.Our Sehen mirror creates zero vibration, so the steady image you get will make you feel much safer. Sehen can't ride the bike for you, but it will make you feel much safer while riding.  The sleek design will make you look and feel good. One of our biggest challenges was to make a rearview mirror that lets you see perfectly while making you feel proud to wear it. Sehen's design is not only for aesthetics.

It has 90% reflectivity - practically the same as a commercial glass mirror, which has 94% reflectivity. It's so close you won't notice the difference, and it's half the weight. Sehen is safer and lighter.You can't get a steady image even with an expensive camera and monitor, you have to deal with electronics, batteries, weight, and cables, it isn't vibrationless, affordable, reliable, compact, lightweight, or portable. Sehen strikes the perfect balance and is available today.

We have been using our Sehens for months and none have broken or even bent, and we keep it in our pocket among keys, etc. - really harsh treatment. If there is ever any bending, you can unbend it by submerging it in boiling water. It’s thermoformable for a few seconds after.",46.0,3,"1 Campaign

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p><strong>Hi Indiegogo!</strong> We are EGLA Communications, an innovative start-up technology company that is creating cloud storage that everyone can afford. Did you know  everyone is moving their data to the cloud?  Yes, now you no longer need a hard drive to store your files because cloud storage is transforming the way data is saved.  If you're asking yourself what exactly cloud storage is, it's basically a remote hard drive online that is available to you from any computer through the internet. To facilitate this transition to the cloud, we want to be your company of choice.</p>
<p><strong>What's the problem?</strong> Do you ever get worried about your computer or laptop crashing and losing all your precious data? Are you tired of always having to manually backup your computer to your external drive? And by the way, when was the last time you backed up your drive? </p>
<p>Using a hard drive is the “old fashioned” way of storing data and will eventually become obsolete. Everyone knows it’s just a matter of time till hard drives fail or run out of storage space. And when they fail you'll lose everything on it! That's why backing up your data to the cloud is the preferred method for storing data.  It's easy and convenient. However, up until now, it has also been expensive and out of reach for most individuals and companies.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 180px;""><strong><img alt=""EGLA COMMUNICATIONS LOGO"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://angelsoft-as2-appr.s3.amazonaws.com/r/uploads/enterprise/446801544/logo/default_logo.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""EGLA COMMUNICATIONS""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>So what's the solution? </strong>The HulaDrive! The HulaDrive is cloud storage for the rest of us.  It enables all your precious files, folders, documents, pictures, or videos to be held in one secure location online that is conveniently accessible and available to you on any device.  Most importantly, the HulaDrive is very affordable when compared to other cloud providers. We think this is the perfect campaign for launching on Indiegogo, because we know everyone can use cloud storage at an affordable price.</p>
<p><strong>So how does the HulaDrive work?</strong> Like its name portrays, your data connects and is stored to the Hula drive (the cloud) and is available to you on your desktop, laptop, tablet and/or mobile device...then it automatically syncs with all your devices and the cloud instantly in a circular motion like that of a hula-hoop. So whenever one of your files is edited and saved to your HulaDrive folder it will be backed up automatically on all your devices.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/FFpDD.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>So what are some features and benefits of the HulaDrive?</strong>  The HulaDrive will offer auto synchronization, auto backup, multiple user sharing and collaboration, security and accessibility at no additional cost.  We're also in the process of developing a HulaDrive application that will be downloadable on your smart phones and tablets that will allow you to save, store, access, and better manage your data from anywhere at any time from any of your portable devices. </p>
<p>Our value proposition is pretty simple, we are better than our competition for a number of reasons but the number one reason is because we strive to be the lowest cost cloud storage provider.  We're currently a small operation so we don't have the large overhead expenses of other companies and since we implement open source software and use technology more efficiently we're able to pass our savings onto you. </p>
<p>To give you an idea of how great our pricing is, we've come up with a special rate package for our project called the ""Indiegogo 20/20"".  This special package deal includes 20 GB of cloud storage for only $20 bucks! Now not to drop any names but our prices are 40% less than our leading competition. Our 20/20 account is perfect for storing videos, pictures, music, documents, big files, in fact it’s big enough to store 20 full length movies and 5,000 songs. Now that’s a lot of space!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/kR0Oi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p><strong>Want more proof?</strong> The HulaDrive began with Dr. Edwin Hernandez who developed this innovative cloud storage system to be better, faster, and more affordable. Dr. Hernandez has years of experience in cloud computing by building clouds while working in the labs at the University of Florida and completing his Ph.D in computer engineering.  He has designed the HulaDrive to be superior by leveraging software rather than hardware. As a result, our operational costs are lower, and this enables us to pass those savings on to you, our supporters.  Furthermore, we are planning on partnering up with the National Science Foundation's University Cooperative Research Center, as well as Florida Atlantic University, and Florida International University.</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/2r898t-D1bk"" width=""560""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p><strong>That's great, but is it secure?</strong> The HulaDrive is secure because it uses 128 bit encryption, SSL, and it is password protected. In fact, the level of security is on par with most banks. Moreover, our data architecture allows the creation of redundant points of access worldwide, thus preventing loss of data while yielding delivering speeds that won’t disappoint. Our cloud uses the latest SAS drives, and is connected to the LambdaRail, the ultra-high performance national fiber optic network. Our server room is located at Florida Atlantic University's Technology Business Incubator in Boca Raton, FL. Our facility has two backup generators, so your data remains safe in case of a natural disaster.</p>
<p><strong>What about software developers?</strong> Our platform was built to support the development community.  Using our Software Development Kit (SDK) tools, you can customize your storage applications to suit your needs and build applications to take advantage of our affordable storage solutions. It's simple, we provide the cloud and the tools so you can access your data anywhere, anytime. If you are a software developer you now have the platform to develop your dreams in the cloud!</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/Z1JPw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Start your Hula Drive Account Today! </strong>Indiegogo, we need your help to make the HulaDrive a success. Through this Indiegogo campaign, your contributions will help us build the infrastructure we need for the HulaDrive. By pledging with us, you will not only be supporting our campaign, but you will also receive cloud storage! Yes, when you contribute, you get something in return!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Through this special Indiegogo offer, we are offering most of our cloud storage at a special introductory rate of 6 cents per GB for a whole year.  For example, our 50 GB offer is only $36 for a whole year, which works out to $3 per month! This rate is a steal considering that our closest competitor sells storage space at 10 cents per GB. Once our Indiegogo campaign is over, we will then revert to our regular cloud storage price of 8 cents per GB.  But that's still a lot of storage at a very low price!</p>
<p>Your Indiegogo contributions will receive the following perks according to this graduated schedule:</p>

<p>Thank you for supporting our Indiegogo campaign. We look forward to making cloud storage available for the rest of us!</p></div>","Hi Indiegogo! We are EGLA Communications, an innovative start-up technology company that is creating cloud storage that everyone can afford. Did you know  everyone is moving their data to the cloud?  Yes, now you no longer need a hard drive to store your files because cloud storage is transforming the way data is saved.  If you're asking yourself what exactly cloud storage is, it's basically a remote hard drive online that is available to you from any computer through the internet. To facilitate this transition to the cloud, we want to be your company of choice.
What's the problem? Do you ever get worried about your computer or laptop crashing and losing all your precious data? Are you tired of always having to manually backup your computer to your external drive? And by the way, when was the last time you backed up your drive? 
Using a hard drive is the “old fashioned” way of storing data and will eventually become obsolete. Everyone knows it’s just a matter of time till hard drives fail or run out of storage space. And when they fail you'll lose everything on it! That's why backing up your data to the cloud is the preferred method for storing data.  It's easy and convenient. However, up until now, it has also been expensive and out of reach for most individuals and companies.

So what's the solution? The HulaDrive! The HulaDrive is cloud storage for the rest of us.  It enables all your precious files, folders, documents, pictures, or videos to be held in one secure location online that is conveniently accessible and available to you on any device.  Most importantly, the HulaDrive is very affordable when compared to other cloud providers. We think this is the perfect campaign for launching on Indiegogo, because we know everyone can use cloud storage at an affordable price.
So how does the HulaDrive work? Like its name portrays, your data connects and is stored to the Hula drive (the cloud) and is available to you on your desktop, laptop, tablet and/or mobile device...then it automatically syncs with all your devices and the cloud instantly in a circular motion like that of a hula-hoop. So whenever one of your files is edited and saved to your HulaDrive folder it will be backed up automatically on all your devices.

So what are some features and benefits of the HulaDrive?  The HulaDrive will offer auto synchronization, auto backup, multiple user sharing and collaboration, security and accessibility at no additional cost.  We're also in the process of developing a HulaDrive application that will be downloadable on your smart phones and tablets that will allow you to save, store, access, and better manage your data from anywhere at any time from any of your portable devices. 
Our value proposition is pretty simple, we are better than our competition for a number of reasons but the number one reason is because we strive to be the lowest cost cloud storage provider.  We're currently a small operation so we don't have the large overhead expenses of other companies and since we implement open source software and use technology more efficiently we're able to pass our savings onto you. 
To give you an idea of how great our pricing is, we've come up with a special rate package for our project called the ""Indiegogo 20/20"".  This special package deal includes 20 GB of cloud storage for only $20 bucks! Now not to drop any names but our prices are 40% less than our leading competition. Our 20/20 account is perfect for storing videos, pictures, music, documents, big files, in fact it’s big enough to store 20 full length movies and 5,000 songs. Now that’s a lot of space!
 
Want more proof? The HulaDrive began with Dr. Edwin Hernandez who developed this innovative cloud storage system to be better, faster, and more affordable. Dr. Hernandez has years of experience in cloud computing by building clouds while working in the labs at the University of Florida and completing his Ph.D in computer engineering.  He has designed the HulaDrive to be superior by leveraging software rather than hardware. As a result, our operational costs are lower, and this enables us to pass those savings on to you, our supporters.  Furthermore, we are planning on partnering up with the National Science Foundation's University Cooperative Research Center, as well as Florida Atlantic University, and Florida International University.

That's great, but is it secure? The HulaDrive is secure because it uses 128 bit encryption, SSL, and it is password protected. In fact, the level of security is on par with most banks. Moreover, our data architecture allows the creation of redundant points of access worldwide, thus preventing loss of data while yielding delivering speeds that won’t disappoint. Our cloud uses the latest SAS drives, and is connected to the LambdaRail, the ultra-high performance national fiber optic network. Our server room is located at Florida Atlantic University's Technology Business Incubator in Boca Raton, FL. Our facility has two backup generators, so your data remains safe in case of a natural disaster.
What about software developers? Our platform was built to support the development community.  Using our Software Development Kit (SDK) tools, you can customize your storage applications to suit your needs and build applications to take advantage of our affordable storage solutions. It's simple, we provide the cloud and the tools so you can access your data anywhere, anytime. If you are a software developer you now have the platform to develop your dreams in the cloud!

Start your Hula Drive Account Today! Indiegogo, we need your help to make the HulaDrive a success. Through this Indiegogo campaign, your contributions will help us build the infrastructure we need for the HulaDrive. By pledging with us, you will not only be supporting our campaign, but you will also receive cloud storage! Yes, when you contribute, you get something in return!
 
Through this special Indiegogo offer, we are offering most of our cloud storage at a special introductory rate of 6 cents per GB for a whole year.  For example, our 50 GB offer is only $36 for a whole year, which works out to $3 per month! This rate is a steal considering that our closest competitor sells storage space at 10 cents per GB. Once our Indiegogo campaign is over, we will then revert to our regular cloud storage price of 8 cents per GB.  But that's still a lot of storage at a very low price!

How will the funds be used? Upon completion of this Indiegogo project, we'll use the money obtained to purchase the servers we need to build the larger part of the HulaDrive and help pay our electricity bill. We will purchase or lease enough servers to satisfy the demand for cloud storage and eventually scale up as we grow.  Then we'll put on some elbow grease and get back to work.  See our campaign timeline below.

<p>Kate/Wub needs a new fast bike! She saved up to buy a new bike this summer but alas she is a poor grad student again and the money ended up going for things like books and security deposits. I'm hoping we can come together and raise the money to buy her a new Surly road bike, along with a few other biking accessories she desperately needs for getting back and forth to class this winter.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The goal</h3>
<p>Raise enough money that we will be able to build Kate a custom Surly for Christmas that will hold up for years to come. I would also like to get her a few essential bike things she has really needed. Kate really needs a good winter/rain biking jacket, winter bike gloves, a new helmet and some waterproof panniers for her books and laptop. The total cost of everything Kate needs is $1500. Right now I'm about $500 short of getting this bike under the tree for her. So, I'm turning to friends and family in the hope that we can come together and get Kate an awesome Christmas present.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Every little bit helps</h3>
<div>
<p>I know you all have a special place in your heart for Wub aka the love of my life Kate Winterbottom and it would really mean a lot if I could get everyones help to make this happen for her. So what ever you can give would be very appreciated. Also if you know anyone that I should of emailed about the Kates Surly Christmas campaign but didn't please let them know! </p>

<h3>The Back Story-</h3>
<p>This all started with an episode of Top Gear UK, I was just a kid and decided it would be a cool idea to buy an old coupe and make it original. Needless to say I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I found a 1972 Opel GT and thought that because I had never heard of it, it would be the perfect place to start.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I brought it home after making many-many payments to the current owner. Then I found out that I had to track down the original owner due to the fact that I didn’t have enough info to get an ownership for it. After that adventure I came to the realization that finding the parts for this behemoth was impossible.</p>
<p><br/> Contributions to this project would literally bring back my faith in humanity; cars are my absolute passion. I decided to start this campaign because of my love for classic European sports cars. If this doesn’t work I’m afraid this wonder of German engineering might find its way into becoming a small steel cube.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your donations will save this lovely vehicle and insure that it lives another 40 years. If we don’t save old classics all we will have are plastic cars built for economy covering our streets, and nothing to turn our heads at. Do you want to live in that world??</p>
<p><strong>Here’s Where you Come in-</strong></p>
<p>I’m playing it very safe, as this is my first IGG attempt ever, in a 5k target. This injection will be enough for me to fix the engine, complete the body work, and get a very subtle interior completed. My blood and sweat will be going into every minute of this process.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My main perk will consist of a project book; it will have full documentation of where all the money went in completing the process, pictures from start to finish and if you contribute your name in the thank you section in the front. Lastly, if you’re local to the GTA large contributors will get the opportunity to use the car for a day (no bank robberies) for commercial advertisements or weddings.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact-</strong></p>
<p>I know this isn’t the common Indie GOGO project, but it is something close to my heart, and the restoration of beautiful classic cars is a passion for a lot of car lovers. Your help will give this sexy old girl another chance to hit the streets again.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways to Help-</strong></p>
<p>Share on Twitter or Facebook, 90 days to make a miracle happen :)</p>

<h3>Our ride so far...<br/>
</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Two friends John Vournas and Doug Woodard decided to become business partners and start “Platinum Transportation” in 2010 in Phoenix Arizona. Despite the poor economy and only $8,000 available for start-up, they figured out an original and innovative method of transportation that’s been consistently desired by the nightlife crowd. They and their friend, Brandon Donnelly, are ambitious entrepreneurs held back only by lack of capital.<br/><br/></p>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">The idea for TranSend was had one day while driving for their company. It would be a revolution in ground transportation brought about by technology. Using GPS capabilities via Smartphone, dispatchers for cab companies would no longer be needed. Using an app designed specifically for this purpose, both the driver and person seeking a ride could communicate efficiently, directly to one-another, creating an all around improvement in the world of transportation.<br/>
</div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/>Learning that no one else has an app on the market with the functionality or purpose they vision their app incorporating, Brandon, John and Doug decided to brainstorm.

Two friends John Vournas and Doug Woodard decided to become business partners and start “Platinum Transportation” in 2010 in Phoenix Arizona. Despite the poor economy and only $8,000 available for start-up, they figured out an original and innovative method of transportation that’s been consistently desired by the nightlife crowd. They and their friend, Brandon Donnelly, are ambitious entrepreneurs held back only by lack of capital.
The idea for TranSend was had one day while driving for their company. It would be a revolution in ground transportation brought about by technology. Using GPS capabilities via Smartphone, dispatchers for cab companies would no longer be needed. Using an app designed specifically for this purpose, both the driver and person seeking a ride could communicate efficiently, directly to one-another, creating an all around improvement in the world of transportation.

Learning that no one else has an app on the market with the functionality or purpose they vision their app incorporating, Brandon, John and Doug decided to brainstorm. Over the next two months the intricacies turned into a project plan. After presenting the plan to an investor and being turned down, we realized that merely a project plan wasn’t enough. Instead a complete model of a in the form of a business plan was necessary. For three months we did extensive market research learning everything possibly could about the app industry.Seven months after the idea originated, the strongest model of TranSend is ready for production. A development company has been contracted to build the app. Production had started but is currently at a stand-still due to the lack of capital to continue. With your help, we can finish TranSend and turn its service on allowing people to know who they are booking for transportation and do it more efficiently.

<p>In late 2017, Backfire launched the <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/backfire-g2-best-electric-longboard-under-500/x/18899335#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Galaxy G2 campaign</a>, it is a great success(with 800+ backers, thank you!), our customers loved it. But we didn't stop there, because we want more, because our customers want more, during the years, many of our customers asked: Do you have bigger wheels? Can I ride on grass or hills or even with mud? Can I ride longer and further? Now we have got an answer for all these questions: <strong>Backfire Ranger X1</strong>!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529826698/suat6trvi5gtil1kh7mr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Larger Battery with 21miles Range</h3>
<p>When it comes to electric skateboards, range and speed is the one of the most discussed topic. Ranger X1 has improved larger battery pack(36V, 14Ah capacity) with LG Cells, it can ride as far as 21 miles(the data here is from real tests, test condition: 30kph average riding speed, 75kg rider's weight, on smooth flat road with gentle breeze), and reach top speed up to 22mph(36kph). Watch the video below to see Backfire Ranger X1's real world range test result:</p>

<div> </div>
<h3>Full Body Water and Dust Proof</h3>
<p>Unlike those who claims to be all-terrain skateboard, Ranger X1 is a real all-terrain skateboard with water and dust proof mechanism. Major components on the board like the ESC module and the battery modules are covered and protected with special materials, now, you don't need to worry about hurting your board when riding in bad weather.</p>

<h3>All-Terrain Wheels with Replaceable Tires</h3>
<p>To get great riding experience, bigger wheels alone is not enough. That's why we give Ranger X1 airless rubber wheels, it has special honeycomb architecture, and it's independently replaceable. Unlike traditional PU tires used on many skateboards, this special rubber tire has improved friction, it also absorbs shocking during riding.</p>

<h3>Hub Motor System: Less Complicated, More Reliable</h3>
<p>Ranger X1 is not the only all-terrain electric skateboard in the market, but unlike many other all-terrain skateboards with clumsy motor-belt-gear drive system, Ranger X1 has Hub Motors! This means Ranger X1 doesn't need all these standalone motors belts gears and all these small parts, the motor the wheel and the tire are naturally fitted into one solid piece, the entire power system is just much simpler and more efficient and responsive. As an all-terrain electric skateboard, you would probably ride under tough condition(with water dust sand rock or mud), those complicated motor-belt-gear system with so many exposed parts are more likely to break or get stuck, causing so much trouble to clean or fix them, while hub motors are less likely to break.</p>

<h3>Double Kingpin Truck with Great Carving Experience</h3>
<p>Many of you may be wondering what would it feel to ride a skateboard with such big wheels? The answer is: it's just like your old ones, if not better. Because Ranger X1 is equipped with double kingpin trucks, minimum turning radius is only 2 meters! Together with the 6.5"""" wheels,  you get all-terrain riding experience without sacrificing maneuverability, it still gives you the same if not better carving experience!</p>

<p>Founded in 2007, by Aaron Ellison, the Ellison Corporation (d/b/a Ellison Traffic Control Systems, LLC) (“Ellison”) creates innovative safety devices for public roadways. </p>
<p>The mission of the Ellison Corporation is to <strong><em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">remove the fear</span></em></strong> currently experienced by emergency responders as they proceed as rapidly as possible to provide aid, prevent a crime, or put out a fire.  Even though emergency vehicles come equipped with sirens and their own flashing lights, this is often not enough with all the distractions of today’s drivers. <strong><em>There are no breakthrough, attention grabbing, green, modern looking systems available to city, county and state transportation agencies that effectively warn the public an emergency vehicle is approaching.</em></strong></p>
<p>The Ellison Corporation was birthed from the Detroit Based Initiative business development program (“DBI”). The DBI program is a part of TechTown, an entrepreneurial research and technology park located on the campus of Wayne State University. The Ellison Corporation’s first project is the Emergency Response Warning System. This is an innovative safety system designed to reduce the number of injuries and accidents with property and collateral damage that often occur when emergency vehicles are not given the right of way while responding to emergencies. </p>
<p><em>About the product</em></p>
<p>The Emergency Response Warning System, (ERWS) is a patented revolutionary traffic control system that integrates pre-emption/priority control, traffic control and green technology all in one complete package.  ERWS features red and blue flashing LED lights to grab the attention of motorists who otherwise wouldn’t see nor hear a siren from an oncoming emergency vehicle. This can be due in part from many distractions inside the vehicle, loud music, well insulated cabins, or an inattentive driver.  Many experts in the transportation industry and emergency responders who have been privileged to see and understand the technology behind the ERWS, have said that this system will be the most effective compared to similar products on the market. The Michigan State police have approved the installation of a EWRS system on their test track; thereby demonstrate their strong belief and support of the system.</p>
<p><em>Need</em></p>
<p>Funds are needed for tooling, upto 14 parts for installation and testing at our state police trainging facility in Lansing, MI. 8 of these completed parts will be used for demostration purposes. Funds will also help with installation and testing for two cities and one local university that has expressed interest in being part of the pilot program. Although there is no official endorsement from our state police agency nor the state's transportation agency, we are thrilled to have them both on board to assist us with testing and proving out this system. Funds will allow us to purchase 10 wind turbines, solar panels, LEDs lights and all the internal components needed for proper testing. Finally, we will also allocate funds to redo our website which was comprimised. </p>
<p><em>Benefits</em></p>
<p>For example, in 2007, in the State of Michigan, there were over 2,300 accidents involving emergency vehicles, resulting in four (4) of fatal accidents and 69 A-level incapacitating injuries. There were 451 accidents at signalized intersections. Units in accidents of all severities at signalized intersections included 350 police, 56 fire, and 66 ambulance vehicles. According to the Office of Highway Safety Planning for Michigan, from 2008 to 2012, there were more than 6,551 collisions between emergency vehicles and motorists. We believe that once our product is put in place, it will drastically reduce these numbers.</p>
<p>The ERWS was created for municipalities with heavily travelled streets and intersections. Those cities looking to add cosmetic appeal for certain areas, such as large city downtown locations, are considered one of the first entities likely to implement ERWS. Secondly, cities where the political goals coincide with the principle advantages of ERWS – public safety, green technology, and energy cost savings, are likely to move forward. Cities with large numbers of motorcades would especially benefit. There are two major US cities that have expressed great interest. One wants to be the pilot city.</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 1.45em;""> Reflective material in any form sends light back to its source. Our Reflective bicycles are coated in a special reflective material that does just that. The effect seen depends on the light conditions, so to pedestrians or cyclists, your frame will not be distracting, it simply ensures visibility from car drivers and safety for everybody.<br/> One of the best benefits; <b><i>no batteries required</i></b>. Your bicycle will stay reflective for seven years guaranteed, but with proper care, can stay reflective indefinitely. The bike will reflect the quality and intensity of light projected which is perfect for car headlights. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span> The images below show a comparison of indirect and direct light in a well-lit room represented here by our camera flash off (left) and on (right). The pictures on the right are an example of how reflective coating bounces back camera flash, which would simulate a car driver's perspective in daylight;<br/></span></p>

</h2>
<p> When driving, you are aligned with the headlight angle, when car headlights illuminate the bike frame, rims and spokes, your bike will be the most visible thing on the street. The illustration below demonstrates how the car driver (A) would see the reflection at it's most intense. The rider and pedestrian (B&amp;C) will see a lesser amount of reflection, so you'll stand out to drivers without being distracting on the road.<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/404585/files/20140302040137-Screen_shot_2014-03-02_at_1.01.01_PM.png?1393761697"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p> In May 2013 we got in touch with one of the major suppliers of reflective material for industrial use in Germany. The material we got our hands on is perfect to adapt to bikes because it is built to resist all weather conditions, it is anti-corrosion, coated with a strong layer of varnish and comes with a warranty of 7 years of consistent light reflection. This is exactly what you need for a bike coating, it will also protect the coated frame from rust and is scratch-resistant.<br/><br/> The first frames were built as soon as we had the material so we could test it under all conditions.

This project will fund the creation of a line of reflective bicycles specifically designed to destroy planned obsolescence with style.


Reflective Bicycles



 Reflective material in any form sends light back to its source. Our Reflective bicycles are coated in a special reflective material that does just that. The effect seen depends on the light conditions, so to pedestrians or cyclists, your frame will not be distracting, it simply ensures visibility from car drivers and safety for everybody. One of the best benefits; no batteries required. Your bicycle will stay reflective for seven years guaranteed, but with proper care, can stay reflective indefinitely. The bike will reflect the quality and intensity of light projected which is perfect for car headlights.  The images below show a comparison of indirect and direct light in a well-lit room represented here by our camera flash off (left) and on (right). The pictures on the right are an example of how reflective coating bounces back camera flash, which would simulate a car driver's perspective in daylight;






A driver's perspective;

 When driving, you are aligned with the headlight angle, when car headlights illuminate the bike frame, rims and spokes, your bike will be the most visible thing on the street. The illustration below demonstrates how the car driver (A) would see the reflection at it's most intense. The rider and pedestrian (B&C) will see a lesser amount of reflection, so you'll stand out to drivers without being distracting on the road.

 The photo below was taken from the driver's perspective inside a car. Notice how the road sign in the background shows a similar type of reflection. 
The Bicycles;
 In May 2013 we got in touch with one of the major suppliers of reflective material for industrial use in Germany. The material we got our hands on is perfect to adapt to bikes because it is built to resist all weather conditions, it is anti-corrosion, coated with a strong layer of varnish and comes with a warranty of 7 years of consistent light reflection.

Over the past 10 months, all aspects of the process and the materials have successfully endured heavy daily testing, surviving direct sunlight, high humidity, winter snow, mud etc... 

Anti-programmed-obsolescence;
We have one master bike-builder who has been making bicycles as a hobby and professionally for the last six years. After relying on bikes as a primary form of transport and repairing many flimsy bicycles, it became apparent that there was a need for bikes that are sturdy with a minimum amount of maintenance, there's a need for bikes that are built to last that don't come with flimsy excessive parts as standard.     A selection of components were made to ensure a light, yet durable bike that needs no replacement parts for the next 5 years; tires of solid rubber which means no punctures, front drum brakes which means no brake pad replacement,  back coaster break which means no cables to mess with, making this bike a light, reliable and swift ride.

Brook's Saddle (B17 Narrow / B17 Imperial).

Shimano Square Taper bottom braket. 

Sturmey Archer crank.

USB-Rechargeable lights front and back. 
Each bike will have a unique digitally-engraved nameplate

 Every bike is handmade and will be unique in it's own right. Our rides deserve as much attention to every minor detail as possible, which means there's a variety of parts that may differ on each bike, such as the saddle, handelbars, crank set and the finish which, each chosen to fit with the overall individual style of the ride.  We're working on an embedded GPS tracker which can locate the bike in

</div></div>","Our aim

Our aim is to make cycling more fun, to make cyclists visible at night, turning the bike wheels into a full-color persistence-of-vision displays. Also we'd like to allow everybody to create his own images, patterns and texts, to share them online and to upload them into the device.
What is Ledus Wheelus
Ledus Wheelus is a:


Full-color bicycle wheel lights with a Mini-USB port

Software to create, share and upload image patterns
Available for Mac, PC and online

 

Personally I don't like to carry any additional weight while cycling, so there are some more design features of the hardware piece:

 

It must be very light (25 grams with a battery)
Have a standard AAA battery onboard, no wires
Run at least for 24 hours on one charge (that's 2-3 weeks of everyday's riding)
Have some touch-sensitive buttons to run/pause/select patterns

Current Status 

At the moment we've produced the limited number of prototypes which comply all the declared features. Plus we've made a software, so everybody can view and create patterns and libraries online already.

 
What We Need & What You Get

We need a funding to move the project further, to turn the prototypes into a complete factory product available for everybody. As well as to make the product even better.

Our funders will get signed device prototypes and other perks and rewards.

Other ways to help
Everyone can try to create an image pattern. That's easy! :)

Some more info about our team, technologies and inspiration is at our credits page.


Also I've made a shorter version of a video for all occupied people :)

  The Everest XF900 was designed to tackle any mountain in your path. Whether you’re riding through literal mountains, or just navigating an urban jungle, the Everest XF900 is capable of going wherever your adventures take you. We started with our beloved motorcycle-style design and worked our way up from there. 750 Watt Bafang MotorTo ascend the mountains, we were going to need a powerful motor. We got a 750 watt Bafang rear hub motor that has a peak wattage output of 1,500 watts! To get up the bigger slopes we made sure to get up to 80 Newton meters of torque.  13 Amp-hour BatteryTo make the round trip, we were going to need a long-lasting power source. We got a 48 volt 13 amp-hour, lithium-ion removable battery that lasts 30-55 miles on a full charge. In case we need to charge a GPS or cell phone, we added an easily-accessible USB charging port right on the battery.  Kenda Fat Tires (26” x4”)To tackle the terrain, we were going to need big tires. We got some Kenda Juggernaut 26” x 4” tires and made sure they had puncture protection. That’ll do the trick.  Tektro Dual Hydraulic BrakesTo handle the steep trails, we were going to need some serious stopping power. We included Tektro disc brakes with 180mm discs in both the front and rear for maximum control.  Front + Rear SuspensionTo glide across the trails, we were going to need some suspension. We got the Partner 26” adjustable front fork and for extra comfort, we added a 750 lbs spring rear shock.  Shimano 7-SpeedTo give us climbing options, we were going to need a few different gears. We got the Shimano Acera SL-M310 7 gear shifter paired with a Shimano Tourney Derailleur.  Bright Front LED LightTo see at night, we were going to need bright light. We thought a 250-lumens front light would do...and it does. Pedal-Assist / Throttle / ManualTo keep things interesting, we were going to need a variety of ways to power this machine. We included pedal assist, twist throttle, walk mode, and human power. How much work you want to put in is up to you! All-TerrainBut wait…why limit this beauty to the mountains? With its big tires, ride it on the pavement, sand, rocks, grass, and even snow! Class 3 eBikeUse the throttle to get up to 22 mph and pedal-assist to reach speeds of 28 mph! This bike is a Class 3 eBike, so usually there are no special licenses required.* *Please check local rules and regulations 100% Guarantee DeliveryThis is not our first ride.

We’re using some of Britain’s best design and engineering talent to help develop the Alcraft project.DesignFor us design is an integral component of a vehicle, and electric vehicles offer the opportunity for designers to rethink the conventional form of the car, without the need to accommodate bulky engines and transmissions. Britain has long produced iconic automotive products, and our design team is developing an Alcraft design language, blending the ultra-clean and contemporary with the timeless values of British design.EngineeringWe are developing British-engineered electric powertrains and vehicle platforms. While focusing on vehicles with pure electric drive, we are also developing supplementary range-extending systems to achieve the optimum balance between environmental impact, performance and range. Our solutions draw on the British engineering tradition of minimising weight and maximising efficiency to enhance performance – an ethos perfectly suited to electric vehicles.                                                                                                                                               THE CAR (see www.alcraftmotor.com for a definitive set of images)The GT illustrates what Alcraft is about - a car with an elegant simplicity and understated, timeless good looks. Everything in the GT’s design has a purpose. Structural elements of the vehicle are visible externally: the exposed carbon-fibre B-pillars and roof structure are part of the aesthetic but serve as both a safety structure and a device to create an exceptionally light cabin, with a roof made largely of glass and a wraparound front screen. The cabin design is about what we call “responsible luxury” - leather is used, but not at the expense of weight or a clean, contemporary design.The GT is not another electric supercar – it’s high-performance yet unashamedly practical, a shooting brake-style rear with a slide-out loading platform giving access to a 500-litre luggage area which can accommodate two golf bags. And even with enthusiastic driving it will be able to cover a typical 200-250-mile weekend trip on one charge, with over 300 miles possible. It has been designed and engineered to be either battery-only or equipped with a range-extender. It has also been designed so that it can made as a 2+2 rather than a two-seater.The GT is about driving involvement rather than specification sheet numbers, torque rather than power, light weight and dynamics rather than straight-line speed and Nurburgring lap times. But the numbers associated with an advanced electric powertrain can’t be ignored. A three-motor configuration with three-motor four-wheel drive means the 840 lb ft torque and 600 horsepower translate into a 0-62mph time of around 3.5 secs. And a weight of only 1700kg, around 75% of a Tesla Model S, combines with torque vectoring to help give outstanding handling.The car will of course have cutting-edge connectivity and apps to make the user experience as seamless as possible and to allow technical and performance software updates.OUR JOURNEY SO FARThe Alcraft GT was conceived by a small team of passionate but pragmatic car enthusiasts, automotive industry professionals and successful business people, with experience ranging from running a globally renowned low-volume British car company – Charles Morgan - to building up British businesses into international enterprises. There was a common view: create something distinctly British, not a me-too product, which we would all like to own.The GT was designed by Matthew Humphries, who was responsible for Morgan’s Aeromax and its fuel-cell LIFE car. The design was carried out in parallel with an engineering team from Delta Motorsport, which has globally recognised expertise in high-performance electric cars and was a key supplier on the Jaguar C-X75 prototype development programme. The rigorous virtual engineering process allowed the design of a complete powertrain and other key systems, so that suppliers could be identified and put in place at an early stage, and safety, type approval and homologation issues could be addressed.The car is now ready to be taken beyond concept. The next step on our journey is to build a full running prototype and show vehicle, which is where this current crowdfunding campaign comes in.If our initiative appeals to you, and you want to be part of the journey to create a British electric vehicle brand, then we would welcome your support to help us take this next step.OUR TEAMDAVID ALCRAFT  (Founder & Managing Director) David is leading the effort to establish an independent car design, development and manufacturing business founded on British design and engineering.

We know you’re concerned about this, and we’re here to set the record straight. A folding point does not have to be a mechanical weakness, and we’ve concentrated most of our R&amp;D here. The use of high strength plastic polymers combined with our engineering experience allowed us to make this system both sturdy and light. </li></ul><p><strong>How flexible is Linky?</strong></p><ul><li>Linky is flexible like a normal longboard. We’ve carefully studied the central support to optimize flex, allowing a sporty yet comfortable ride.</li></ul><p><strong>Will it fold while I am riding it?</strong></p><ul><li>No way. We’ve developed a system of joints to make sure that Linky remains in the open position safely and securely during riding. </li></ul><p><strong>Is it easy to open and close?</strong></p><ul><li>Yes. We’ve worked hard on perfecting the opening and closing mechanism so that it is as smooth and easy as possible. The two parts slide pretty effortlessly open. The mechanism takes literally seconds to open and close.</li></ul><p><strong>Does it ride/push just like a normal longboard?</strong></p><ul><li>Not exactly. No electric longboard feels <i>exactly</i> the same as a non-electric one because the power train system limits the free spinning of the powered wheel, but the difference is minimal. On the other hand, without having to foot-pedal, you do get a sensation of freedom and ease of travel on the Linky. One slight difference from the traditional longboard shape is our signature polygonal foot areas and folding mechanism, which limits the foot placement to the deck areas. Linky should not be used for tricks or dancing (though we’d love to see you invent a new dance on it!), as much as we love those things.</li></ul><p><strong>Why does Linky use </strong><strong>front traction?</strong></p><ul><li>In order to maximize compactness and the electronic yield, we have positioned the electronics all at the front of the board, protected by plastic covers that are sealed with an O-Ring.

(1) A few of you die-hard longboarders have said it would be cool if this board had a kicktail (raised back, for the non-initiated). Unfortunately, this would negatively affect the folding design so it wouldn't fit in a bag. Kicktails are great for tricks and jumps, while Linky was designed mainly to ride flat on the ground. (2) Some people have suggested that a scooter-type handle would make them feel more comfortable on Linky. We've opted for a true longboard performance feel, and we do believe it doesn't take long to get used to riding it. Trust us, it'll be fun. (3) There are some awesome boards with off-road wheels out there, but Linky won't have them. Why? They're too big to fit in the bag, and they obstruct the folding mechanism. Technically you could try adding them yourself, though.</li></ul><p><strong>Is Linky Waterproof?</strong></p><ul><li>Yes. The electronic components are in an o-ring sealed compartment that does not let in dust or water. This means you can ride in rain and through puddles and the electronics will not be affected.  We do not recommend submerging it in a bath, pool, lake or otherwise ;). Also, for safety reasons, although Linky CAN ride in wet conditions, you should be aware that any kind of skateboarding on wet pavement may be dangerous and we don't advise it.</li></ul><p><strong>What is the difference between the regular charger and the fast charger?</strong></p><ul><li>Linky ships with a regular charger, which takes about 3 hours to charge Linky. If you're in a hurry, you can purchase the optional fast charger, so it charges in about half an hour. If you choose the fast charger add-on we'll still ship the regular charger for your board.</li></ul><p><strong>What is a universal charging system?</strong></p><ul><li>One of our stretch goals is a “universal charging system” which is inspired by current electric automobile trends. You can charge Linky with any charger you have on hand, for smartphones or PCs, with a USB or standard AC adapter.</li></ul><p><strong>Can I change the battery?</strong></p><ul><li>The battery can be substituted for maintenance reasons (replacement batteries will be available on our website after production). The battery compartment requires screws to open, and is sealed beneath the waterproofing O-Ring. </li></ul><p><strong>Is there a warrantee? Instruction book?</strong></p><ul>
<li>Yes, Linky comes with a standard <strong>2 year manufacturer's</strong> <strong>warrantee</strong> on the battery and board. In the case of a problem you will contact customer service and we will take care of it.</li>
<li>In addition, as many elements of a skateboard may get damaged due to normal use we will provide a user and <strong>maintenance manual</strong> with the instructions necessary for the maintenance of components such as wheels, bearings and belt. </li>

Get where you want to go in style, on time… then fold up Linky and tuck it away into a bag.Choose from two styles:BAMBOO STYLE / The classic bamboo Linky with red details and clear grip tape CARBON LOOK / Limited Edition All-Black version with Red WheelsEveryone will notice you as you move around campus, but it's discreet in the classroom. Extra bonus: Fits in tiny closets and school lockers :)Make getting to work something you look forward to! Plus Linky is compact, so it respects train and bus regulations for transported objects.Discover new places in total liberty! Linky is portable, compact and air-travel safe* #nolimitsLinky is easy to learn for anyone (even kids!) and even more fun with friends.Linky’s innovative technical features stem from our needs as travelers: light, fast charging, transportable by air, a vintage-modern design and practical but beautiful bags. Using our engineering and technical training, we applied AGILE product development methodology to numerous prototype iterations, testing each phase and implementing features over the past two years.• FOLDING / The patented folding mechanism makes it fast and easy to extend and compress Linky. We’ve worked particularly hard on this system, ensuring its resistance and functionality.• LIGHT / Weighing in at 5.5 kilos (12.1 pounds) it’s amongst the lightest of the electric longboard market. The structure is made of high strength polymers from the automotive industry instead of heavier metal parts, while the deck has a carbon fiber bottom and real bamboo top. • PORTABLE AND FUN / To maximize the riding experience yet keep Linky light, we’ve carefully studied the board’s materials: rigid enough to give Linky sporty cornering abilities during high speed cruising but flexible enough for wide curves. We also chose our wheel size based on research that has shown large 83mm wheels to be ideal for comfortable longboard riding on difficult surfaces.• AIR SAFE / Safety & Air transport: our power system has a BMS (Battery Management Solution) that regulates the battery pack charge and discharge, which ensures both good battery life and total safety. We have calibrated the battery to correspond to the current IATA regulation regarding the transportation of lithium batteries on airplanes. The battery may also be removed for transportation thanks to the modular structure of the battery compartment; we will provide tools and instructions for this.• FAST CHARGE / Its innovative electrics and long life lithium battery come from our experience as automotive industry engineers. Linky charges to 85% of capacity in just 30 minutes and has a range of 18 km (11 miles) using the FAST CHARGER (available as an add-on). • POWERFUL / The motor is a brushless permanent magnet that can go up 10% hills carrying a 100kg load. It reaches a top speed of 30 km/h (18.6 mph). The motor is protected by a cover to ensure safety. It’s optimized to be the best compromise between portability, weight and speed. • REMOTE / A Linky is operated with a remote control that allows you to gradually increase your speed, to brake, and to set riding mode. The remote also has a battery indicator and connects by bluetooth to the board. The remote's lithium battery can be charged with a USB cable, either to a plug or using the board's built in USB port. • REGENERATIVE BRAKING / Linky's battery recharges when you brake... so yay for going downhill (slowly)!• USB PORT / A USB port allows you to use the board to charge your cell phone.• HEADLIGHT / A front LED headlight will help guide you at night.• APP / We've developed an IOS app that will read, store and allow you to share data from the board, as well as to set riding modes. Linky comes with one of three custom designed backpacks or travel bags entirely designed and made in Italy. Our bags are manufactured by hand by an artisan in Monte San Giusto, Italy, who produces accessories for numerous luxury brands.DAILY TRAVELER The “Daily Traveler” is a backpack in lined technical material, designed to hold the Linky as well as a 15-inch laptop (in the padded front pocket so it doesn’t get squished) and your other essentials.

<h3>The Current Problem we face today</h3>
<div>For short distance travels, all current alternatives have its tradeoffs. Walking takes too long, and biking is sweating. Public transit lacks the flexibility in routes and schedules. Gasoline cars cause pollution, congestion, and parking problems. An electric car still suffers with a high initial purchasing cost, the traffic jam, and the parking issue shared with all other gasoline cars.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<div>Our electric scooter is green, economic, portable and convenient to store, and it's easy to learn and fun to ride. We believe Boltz Scooter will be a game changer and disrupt the way we commute.<br/>

<p>Our mission at Boltz Scooter is to provide eco-friendly alternatives to today’s energy-depleting problems. Pollution in urban city is a huge health concern to many. We wish to build a smart city that is clean and leverage on technology to make this world a better place for all :)</p>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>We would like to create a new market with nice integration of existing technologies for the personal transportation space. We plan to build the Boltz scooter business as a platform so 3rd parties making accessories, apps, aftermarket modifications can grow with their business with us. And we will continue to introduce new models in the future. </div><div>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is the risk of market development and acceptation. As for market development, we can see that electric cars have finally started to gain some traction. This is largely thanks to the success of the Tesla Model S. We expect this development to continue and to see that other electric vehicles will also gain popularity over the coming decade. </p>
<p>As for the acceptation of the Boltz Scooter, we believe that there is a large opportunity awaiting. The public exposure that we've had always results in very positive reactions both for the design look and feel, but also for the use of materials and sustainable properties of the complete scooter. </p>
<p>We believe that Boltz Scooter will be a success, and going by our lean and mean efforts to date, we will be sure to mitigate any unforeseen matters. </p>

Short Summary


BoltZ: Fast, Long-Range, Lightweight Electric Scooter for a Cleaner Tomorrow




The Current Problem we face today
For short distance travels, all current alternatives have its tradeoffs. Walking takes too long, and biking is sweating. Public transit lacks the flexibility in routes and schedules. Gasoline cars cause pollution, congestion, and parking problems. An electric car still suffers with a high initial purchasing cost, the traffic jam, and the parking issue shared with all other gasoline cars.



The Solution
Our electric scooter is green, economic, portable and convenient to store, and it's easy to learn and fun to ride. We believe Boltz Scooter will be a game changer and disrupt the way we commute.















Reasons why Boltz Electric Scooter is a great product



Economic: Its energy-efficient design can move you around 500 miles for electricity cost of merely $1, almost 100 times less than when driving a car

Fast: A powerful 350W brushless hub motor is modularized and hidden within the rear wheel so you can go up to 20mph 

Long range:  A rechargeable Lithium Ion battery lasts up to 20miles on a single charge. Our lithium is slim, stable, and non-toxic. 

Foldable & Compact: The folding mechanism is so easy to use that it can be deployed in less than 2 seconds.  Compactness allows you to fit more than 1 unit in the trunk of your sedan with enough room left for your other favorite things

Lightweight: At just 33lbs, the scooter is truly portable to carry a short distance or up a few stairs, so it can stay by your side at all time. 







Designed for Speed and Power
With a 36V, 10.4AH Lithium Ion rechargeable battery, a high efficient hub motor, a controller optimized for most practical usage conditions and overall aerodynamic frame design, the Boltz scooter can travel up to 20 miles on a single charge, so you can go farther with lower costs and fewer charges.








Designed for Compactness 

Boltz scooter's patented folding mechanisms ensure its unparalleled compactness (120cm X 55cm X 30cm in fold). You can easily pack several scooters in the trunk and still have room for your other favorite items. 


Take it everywhere, store it anywhere.
The Boltz scooter weighs only 33lbs/15kg, significantly lighter than other electric scooters or electric bikes on the market. That’s light enough to lift up a few stairs or for a short distance.


Charge it wherever you like

Lithium Ion is ultra-lightweight and non-toxic in comparison with traditional Sealed Lead Acid. Given its portability and low weight, you can easily take Boltz Scooter with you to charge and store indoors. The charger can be plugged into a standard wall socket.


Made for durability and low maintenance

With its high-quality aluminum/stainless steel frame and high-end finishing, Boltz scooter is sturdy and designed for adults. The hub motor is brushless and integrated with the rear wheel, which means high durability and no chains, gears to fuss with. No drag when using it as a regular kick scooter.




Designed for Intelligence and Safety
LED display: Multimode LED dashboard shows you the speed, battery status, odometer, trip distance and total charge cycles at a glance.


For safety there is a 3 speed limit configuration on your LED dashboard to control the max speed of your scooter.
L1 is speed: 0-10mph
L2 is speed: 0-15mph
L3 is speed: 0-20mph

Safe-start throttle and two-staged brake: A configurable anti-jerking feature on the throttle so you only take off when you mean it. The brake first cuts off the throttle function, then applies braking in the rear wheel for a safe and smooth stop. The Boltz scooter ensures your safety from the start to the end of every trip.


Specifications of Boltz 10-Z and 8-Z model









Difference Between Boltz 10-Z and Boltz 8-Z




 


The final pre-production model in the video and pictures is fully functional and true to the specs. It has already gone through multiple riding/safety tests and been CE certified.
Help us finish the last mile, so we can deliver it to your doorstep


While we are close to entering production, your support will help fund:

Packaging design and material order
Mold fabrication
Development of color variants and customizable options
Infrastructure for user support and product maintenance 
Patent fees and other administrative charges on paypal and Indiegogo 

Most importantly, we need your help to spread the word. We would like to bring this sleek machine to the mass market. If we can get more people to know and test the scooter during/after this Indiegogo project, we can continue to improve it based on all the valuable feedbacks.


About Us


At Boltz Scooter, we believe that technology should improve the way we commute without polluting the city. It should also be cool and fun to travel around without compromising the safety of you and the people around you. Hence, we set out to develop the best electric kick scooter that is safe and fun to commute around your neighbourhood.

Our Mission

Our mission at Boltz Scooter is to provide eco-friendly alternatives to today’s energy-depleting problems. Pollution in urban city is a huge health concern to many. We wish to build a smart city that is clean and leverage on technology to make this world a better place for all :)
   The Impact We would like to create a new market with nice integration of existing technologies for the personal transportation space. We plan to build the Boltz scooter business as a platform so 3rd parties making accessories, apps, aftermarket modifications can grow with their business with us. And we will continue to introduce new models in the future. 





Risks & Challenges
There is the risk of market development and acceptation. As for market development, we can see that electric cars have finally started to gain some traction. This is largely thanks to the success of the Tesla Model S. We expect this development to continue and to see that other electric vehicles will also gain popularity over the coming decade. 
As for the acceptation of the Boltz Scooter, we believe that there is a large opportunity awaiting. The public exposure that we've had always results in very positive reactions both for the design look and feel, but also for the use of materials and sustainable properties of the complete scooter. 
We believe that Boltz Scooter will be a success, and going by our lean and mean efforts to date, we will be sure to mitigate any unforeseen matters.

<h2>Pub Pedals now available at: <a href=""http://pubpedals.com/collections/all"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Pub Pedals - Eggbeater platform adaptors""><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">www.PubPedals.com</span></a>

<hr/><h2><strong style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">The Short Story</strong></h2>
<p>Eggbeater pedals are awesome for mountain biking because their four-sided design makes them the easiest pedals to clip into on the trail. But the minimal design that makes them great on the trail is precisely what makes them painful for riding your bike to the pub, or to dinner with friends in your favorite pair of shoes.</p>
<p>We want you to enjoy comfortably biking over to the beach in your Birkenstocks or cruising to a yoga class in your flip-flops.</p>
<p>Pub Pedals are designed so that you can wear any footwear you like with your Eggbeaters and get a comfortable ride.<br/><br/>Say goodbye to the difficulty and discomfort of trying to ride on tiny little Eggbeaters without bike shoes! Just slide Pub Pedals on over your Eggbeaters, and you are ready to ride --- no matter what shoes you are wearing.</p>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">What’s the Secret?</span></h3>

<p>When you slide the Pub Pedal onto your Eggbeater, the force activates the spring inside the Eggbeater to create tension, so that you get a nice secure fit.</p>

<p>Just over a year ago I took my hand-made wooden prototypes to a plastics manufacturer to make proper prototypes on their 3D printer. I then spent a little over one year and $15,000 on designing prototypes and patenting them. We have gone through several revisions. Each time we'd print a 3D prototype, we’d test it out and refine it as we tightened up the tolerances.<br/><br/>Where we’re at now:<br/>We’re ready to make your pedals. The pedal you see in the video is a real, working prototype. The tool molds are cut and ready for production.<br/><br/>With your support, we can put Pub Pedals onto bikes worldwide. Your contribution will help cover the cost of:</p>

<h3>
<br/>Basic Black</h3>
<p>As Henry Ford said of the Model-T, “You can have any color you like; as long as it is black.”</p>
<h3>
<br/>Colors - Henry Ford may have been wrong . . .</h3>
<p>That's right. Back in the day Henry Ford got his ass kicked by the competition due to his unwillingness to give his customers options.</p>
<p>The first question our friends would always ask upon seeing the pedals was: ""What colors will they come in?""</p>
<p>So we thought we’d try not make the same mistake Henry did and test some colors with you during our Indiegogo launch.  colored Pub Pedals cost a little bit more due to the small production runs.  But if you love color, it’s worth it. If there is enough demand for a color, it’ll go into mass production. Otherwise, Pub Pedals of the future could follow the course the Model-T did: exclusively black.</p>
<p>The images below are a pretty decent representation of what the colors will actually look like; but they're not exact.<br/><br/>Just in case you feel the need to match your Pub Pedals with your Eggbeaters (or your bike) we are going to try offering: Yellow, Red, Blue, Black &amp; Pink . . . Okay, so the pink Pub Pedals don’t actually match the Eggbeater 1. But we have had a lot of requests for pink.</p>
<p><span><em><strong>Please Note:</strong> </em>When you choose the colour option there isn’t actually a way to have the four options to choose from during the checkout. But close to the end of the campaign you’ll receive an email that will let you choose which of the four colours you would like.</span><br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/620912/pictures/original/20130117011852-Colours.png?1358414334"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>One of the reasons that I created Pub Pedals was because I sometimes found myself driving my car to places that I would rather have biked to. But because I didn’t want to bother bringing a backpack &amp; change of shoes, or be stuck wearing my bike shoes all night, I drove even though I wanted to bike!  </p>
<p>I’m all for more reasons to ride. It means cleaner air, saving money, avoiding aggravation.<br/><br/>Pub Pedals give you the ease, freedom, and comfort of biking in everyday shoes.</p>
<p>Think of it. When you just want to ride over to the beach...who wants to have to put on bike shoes?</p>

<h2><span style=""font-size: 1.5em;"">Frequently Asked Questions</span></h2>
<p><em>Will pub pedals fit on my Eggbeaters?</em><br/>Yes, pub pedals will work with both new-style and old-style Eggbeater pedals. <span>(see photo above)</span><br/><br/><em>What colors are pub pedals available in?</em><br/>Yellow, Red, Blue, Black &amp; Pink (see images above)<br/><br/><em>Can I ride these on trails?</em><br/>No. It isn't a good idea. Pub Pedals are designed to be used for casual riding only. If you’re going to be on trails or pushing yourself, wear your bike shoes.<br/><br/><em>Can they slide off while riding?</em><br/>As long as you're riding casually then they won’t go anywhere. However, they have been designed to be easy to slide on and off. So while very unlikely, if you make an effort to push out to the side just right, it is possible to get them to slide off. <br/><br/><em>Why do they slide onto some Eggbeaters more easily than others?</em><br/>This is because the amount of spring tension is different across the different styles of Eggbeater pedals. We have found that the amount of spring tension varies with the different styles of Eggbeater. Therefore, your Pub Pedals will slide onto some more easier than others.<br/><br/><em>Why are pub pedals kinda thick and funny looking?</em><br/>The thickness is due to the nature of the Eggbeater pedal.  Although Eggbeaters look really small and minimalist when you factor in the size of the wings they actually aren’t as small as they look. <br/><br/>We made pub pedals with the offset mirror image pattern to simplify the design, and to  prevent the treads from clogging up with snow (because hey, we like to ride all winter long and we live in the Rocky Mountains of Canada).</p>
<p>Why don't Pub Pedals have reflectors?<br/>We did consider adding reflectors. But it was going to add too much to the start up cost. Later when sales are strong enough we might look at adding them on at some piont. The good news is that the sides of the Pub Pedals are smooth so you can easy stick on reflective tape. 3M sells some excellent quality reflective tape I've had on one my backpacks for almost 10 years.</p>
<div>
<em>What exactly are Pub Pedals made of?</em><br/><span>If you want to get technical about it. Pub Pedals are being made with an engineered </span><span>composite resin reinforced with a bit of glass fiber (think fiberglass).

Pub Pedals now available at: www.PubPedals.com

In addition to the Indiegogo site we also had some contributions and pre-orders come in offline.  All together it came to just over $10,000
The Short Story
Eggbeater pedals are awesome for mountain biking because their four-sided design makes them the easiest pedals to clip into on the trail. But the minimal design that makes them great on the trail is precisely what makes them painful for riding your bike to the pub, or to dinner with friends in your favorite pair of shoes.
We want you to enjoy comfortably biking over to the beach in your Birkenstocks or cruising to a yoga class in your flip-flops.
Pub Pedals are designed so that you can wear any footwear you like with your Eggbeaters and get a comfortable ride.Say goodbye to the difficulty and discomfort of trying to ride on tiny little Eggbeaters without bike shoes! Just slide Pub Pedals on over your Eggbeaters, and you are ready to ride --- no matter what shoes you are wearing.
What’s the Secret?

When you slide the Pub Pedal onto your Eggbeater, the force activates the spring inside the Eggbeater to create tension, so that you get a nice secure fit.

Backstory
Just over a year ago I took my hand-made wooden prototypes to a plastics manufacturer to make proper prototypes on their 3D printer. I then spent a little over one year and $15,000 on designing prototypes and patenting them. We have gone through several revisions. Each time we'd print a 3D prototype, we’d test it out and refine it as we tightened up the tolerances.Where we’re at now:We’re ready to make your pedals. The pedal you see in the video is a real, working prototype. The tool molds are cut and ready for production.With your support, we can put Pub Pedals onto bikes worldwide. Your contribution will help cover the cost of:

Mold production
Completing the first production run

Rewards

Basic Black
As Henry Ford said of the Model-T, “You can have any color you like; as long as it is black.”

Colors - Henry Ford may have been wrong . . .
That's right. Back in the day Henry Ford got his ass kicked by the competition due to his unwillingness to give his customers options.
The first question our friends would always ask upon seeing the pedals was: ""What colors will they come in?""
So we thought we’d try not make the same mistake Henry did and test some colors with you during our Indiegogo launch.  colored Pub Pedals cost a little bit more due to the small production runs.  But if you love color, it’s worth it. If there is enough demand for a color, it’ll go into mass production. Otherwise, Pub Pedals of the future could follow the course the Model-T did: exclusively black.
The images below are a pretty decent representation of what the colors will actually look like; but they're not exact.Just in case you feel the need to match your Pub Pedals with your Eggbeaters (or your bike) we are going to try offering: Yellow, Red, Blue, Black & Pink . . . Okay, so the pink Pub Pedals don’t actually match the Eggbeater 1. But we have had a lot of requests for pink.
Please Note: When you choose the colour option there isn’t actually a way to have the four options to choose from during the checkout. But close to the end of the campaign you’ll receive an email that will let you choose which of the four colours you would like.
 
Marbled - Only 4 pair available
When we change colors in production, multi-colored swirls will result in a completely unique set of pedals. If you want the only two-of-a-kind pedals, be the first to choose one of these combinations:

Pink & Black
Black & Red - SOLD
Red & Blue
Blue & Yellow - SOLD
Why are Pub Pedals Important?
One of the reasons that I created Pub Pedals was because I sometimes found myself driving my car to places that I would rather have biked to. But because I didn’t want to bother bringing a backpack & change of shoes, or be stuck wearing my bike shoes all night, I drove even though I wanted to bike!  
I’m all for more reasons to ride. It means cleaner air, saving money, avoiding aggravation.Pub Pedals give you the ease, freedom, and comfort of biking in everyday shoes.
Think of it. When you just want to ride over to the beach...who wants to have to put on bike shoes?

Frequently Asked Questions
Will pub pedals fit on my Eggbeaters?Yes, pub pedals will work with both new-style and old-style Eggbeater pedals. (see photo above)What colors are pub pedals available in?Yellow, Red, Blue, Black & Pink (see images above)Can I ride these on trails?No. It isn't a good idea. Pub Pedals are designed to be used for casual riding only. If you’re going to be on trails or pushing yourself, wear your bike shoes.Can they slide off while riding?As long as you're riding casually then they won’t go anywhere. However, they have been designed to be easy to slide on and off. So while very unlikely, if you make an effort to push out to the side just right, it is possible to get them to slide off. Why do they slide onto some Eggbeaters more easily than others?This is because the amount of spring tension is different across the different styles of Eggbeater pedals. We have found that the amount of spring tension varies with the different styles of Eggbeater. Therefore, your Pub Pedals will slide onto some more easier than others.Why are pub pedals kinda thick and funny looking?The thickness is due to the nature of the Eggbeater pedal.  Although Eggbeaters look really small and minimalist when you factor in the size of the wings they actually aren’t as small as they look. We made pub pedals with the offset mirror image pattern to simplify the design, and to  prevent the treads from clogging up with snow (because hey, we like to ride all winter long and we live in the Rocky Mountains of Canada).
Why don't Pub Pedals have reflectors?We did consider adding reflectors. But it was going to add too much to the start up cost. Later when sales are strong enough we might look at adding them on at some piont. The good news is that the sides of the Pub Pedals are smooth so you can easy stick on reflective tape. 3M sells some excellent quality reflective tape I've had on one my backpacks for almost 10 years.

What exactly are Pub Pedals made of?If you want to get technical about it. Pub Pedals are being made with an engineered composite resin reinforced with a bit of glass fiber (think fiberglass). Which provides high impact tolerance with plenty strength, stiffness, a hard surface, and ability to handle continuous use and long-term stresses. These types of compounds are often used in automotive, and other heavy use utility products.  Basically this means they are made of a really strong high grade plastic.

Progress
Injection Molds are done and 2,500 sets of Pub Pedals will be made before the campaign is done.

 
 
PS. Eggbeaters are not included. However, if you don't already ride on Eggbeaters, but want to, you’re in luck because right now Crank Brothers are offering the Eggbeater 3 - at HALF PRICE!

Other professional positions Kirsten has held includes work for the Danish Transmission System Operator (TSO) and Risø DTU, the Danish National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy. Kirsten has been a lecturer at universities in Kassel, Germany, and Copenhagen, Denmark, and she holds a master's degree in economics from the University of Copenhagen. She also writes satirical cabaret songs about the renewable energy transition in both German and English--and has also written the Crowdfunding Song for the Energy Democracy TV campaign.Please watch the pitch video where Kirsten explains why Energy Democracy TV is essential to making the energy revolution happen. For after all, we must all be the renewable energy we want to see!---Also, we are pleased to have US-born journalist and energy expert Craig Morris in the project. It is safe to say that he has become the most prominent explainer of the German energy transition in the English-speaking world over the past year. A resident of Germany since 1992, Craig has been writing about German energy policy in English for more than a decade and is the author of the 2006 book Energy Switch, which explains to North Americans what Germany is doing. Craig is also the lead author of the new German Energy Transition website, which went online in November 2012; he is also the chief blogger at that site. Since 2010, he has been writing each workday at Renewables International. Craig is currently working on a documentary video in English on the German Energiewende. Go to the video gallery on the top of the campaign page to watch a sample video production by Craig Morris.---To secure the tech side of the project, Energy Democracy TV has Michaela Lehr and Michael Brammer on board, who are the founders and CEO's of Geil,Danke! Mobile Publishing in Berlin. They are passionate about creating app magazines with great user experience--to the degree that they actually named their company after the reaction they want from their customers when they receive their work--in English ""Geil, Danke!"" means ""Cool, thank you!""---In the United States we have Bob Tregilus, co-host with Kirsten Hasberg on This Week in Energy (TWiE), a weekly new-media show. Each week an expert guest panelist joins TWiE co-hosts, Bob and Kirsten, for an informed thoughtful discussion animated by the week's energy news headlines. TWiE is unique in that it's the only energy industry show that covers hot topics in the energy space from the perspective of energy transition (Energiewende) policy experts.Bob Tregilus is based in Reno, Nevada, where he founded Feed-in Tariffs for Nevada (FIT4NV), which had an active FIT bill (based on the German Renewable Energy Act) in the 2011 Nevada State Legislature. He also co-founded the Electric Auto Association of Northern Nevada (EAANN) and he is passionate about the energy transition, electric vehicles, vehicle-to-grid (V2G) and smart garage technology, as well as global economic-, social-, and energy-justice.---Other invaluable members of the Energy Democracy TV team include: Waqas Hussain, Juliane Sperber, Amanda Groschke, Sjouke Ritsema and Thomas Gerke. Special thanks to video producer Daniel Weissensteiner and music producer and singing coach Gitte Degn Calstrup for donating the production of the Crowdfunding Song to the project!

<p>After years of following and working in the bike industry, we saw there was a huge void in the electric bike business. Many people were looking for an affordable, entry-level electric bike. After running the numbers, we began asking the same questions and realized that most electric bike businesses were going from the manufacturer to wholesale, to the distributor, to local retail stores. Each phase tacking on an industry average 40% mark up. This lead to the most basic electric bike costing over $2,199.  Aside from the high prices, we noticed many were neither ergonomic or aesthetically pleasing. Most electric bikes were bulky, with unnecessary parts that added more weight to the bike itself. In addition, the Batteries were oversized and didn't hold enough power. We set out to engineer a compact battery that delivers more power and is half the weight and price. We went for the minimalist yet, perfected electric bike whilst keeping the cost as low as possible, therefore creating Zycle. </p>

Electric Bike Review of Zycle
 

 

What is it like to ride   Zyle like firsthand? Watch the video and read the full first-hand report from Electric Bike Review.
 

 
  



 
 
The electric revolution is here, and Zycle is leading the charge. Reduce your carbon footprint, ditch the gridlock, and save yourself the hassle of a heavy bike. Aside from Zycle's durability, the portable and interchangeable battery meets all FAA requirements, allowing you to fly with it! 
 

 

 


 

 



 
Weighing in at only 42 lbs, including the battery, Zycle is one of the lightest eBikes on the road.
  
 
  

 
The quick fold system, makes it easy for you to take your Zycle with you anywhere and everywhere. It's as simple as folding the frame, the stem, and adjusting the seat. 
 
  
 

 
Crafted with 6061 Aircraft Aluminum, Zycle weighs 42lbs, including the 4lb battery. Compared to other eBikes on the market that weigh up to 45lbs, not including a battery. While Zycle is light, it is also strong, with a weight capacity of 330lbs.
 
  
 


 
With waterproof sealant and 6061 Aircraft Aluminum, Zycle can withstand all conditions. We've stress tested the durable 6061-grade aluminum frame to ensure it is high quality, long-lasting, and weatherproof, so your Zycle endures the city streets.
 
 
  



 
Travel the distance with a 250W motor, compact and adjustable battery, Tektro front and rear dual disc brakes, and much more. Not one for 100% electric? No problem, Zycle comes with a 5 level pedal assist Shimano gear system.
 
 
   

 
With a maximum torque of 35 N.m, Zycle can tackle hills with up to 45 degrees gradeability. Comprised of 6 gears and 5 levels of pedal assist, you can choose to ride your Zycle with assistance or without.

 


Throttle - You have the choice to pedal and not use the throttle or only use the throttle and make your Zycle 100% electric.

Pedal assist - Choose from 5 levels or pedal assist without a throttle. Level 1 is the lowest assist level with little help to level 5 which is the strongest assist level giving the rider extensive help. You also have the option to turn the pedal assist off, turning Zycle into a normal bike.

 
 
  
Designed to be compact and easily removable for ease of travel and convenience.  
Each interchangeable lithium-ion 36V 7.8ah Samsung battery pack gives Zycle a range of 20-40 miles. Doubling as a power bank, with s USB port neatly hidden on the underside, so you can charge your small electronics on the go.
That's not all! Approved by the FAA, you can easily travel with Zycle.
 
  


 
Using quality parts like Xenon head and tail lights, you are riding a machine built by bicyclists for bicyclists. Aside from providing light for safety, the Xenon lights use a minimal battery, giving you more distance for your ride!
 
 
  



 
With Zycle's built-in Bluetooth technology and low maintenance self-controller, you can track mileage traveled and take care of any issues your Zycle might experience on your own.
 
 
  


 
Connecting to your smartphone through Bluetooth, you can track your statistics including mileage, travel time, speed, battery level, mapped route, and even your CO2 emission reduction. Additionally, every time you turn your Zycle on, the app will run a diagnostics test to ensure everything is running smoothly.
 
 
  


 
With a built-in smart controller, Zycle runs a 60 point self-inspection of the controller and software so you are alerted to any issues with your bike before you start your ride. Just like your car's oil change, Zycle will run mileage checks for routine maintenance every 3-5,000 miles.
 
 
  

 
 




 


 




 

 

 
After years of following and working in the bike industry, we saw there was a huge void in the electric bike business. Many people were looking for an affordable, entry-level electric bike. After running the numbers, we began asking the same questions and realized that most electric bike businesses were going from the manufacturer to wholesale, to the distributor, to local retail stores. Each phase tacking on an industry average 40% mark up. This lead to the most basic electric bike costing over $2,199.  Aside from the high prices, we noticed many were neither ergonomic or aesthetically pleasing. Most electric bikes were bulky, with unnecessary parts that added more weight to the bike itself. In addition, the Batteries were oversized and didn't hold enough power. We set out to engineer a compact battery that delivers more power and is half the weight and price. We went for the minimalist yet, perfected electric bike whilst keeping the cost as low as possible, therefore creating Zycle.

Everything started around 1977 when the three brothers Alex, Reza and Hendrik turned their motorcycles into Cafe Racer bikes.The dream was to one day start their own company and make it something special.Rumble Motors is a company based on innovation and understanding of today’s transportation.We wanted Rumble e-Bike to fit everyone, we understood that many ""motor-heads"" like us didn't like the fact that electric bikes didn't have an engine sound. Therefore, we created a great sound that resembles the Rumble feeling when you hit the throttle, also for safety it is perfect if you are riding your Rumble in the city enabling drivers to hear you coming.from left: Alex, Reza, Hendrik - Year: 1977

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3>Hello, my name is Jon. I live in Murrieta, CA. As someone who has been riding bikes of all shapes, sizes, and types throughout the course of my life. I truly believe in the power of cycling. For some, bikes are the perfect way to get out of traffic and make that commute to work a little more tolerable. For others it's a way to squeeze in some exercise without being stuck in the gym, or they can simply be a way to relieve some of that built up stress that so many of us are burdened with. More importantly there is a group within society for which a bike is much more than entertainment or exercise - it is a necessary tool. Many people rely on their bicycle as their primary mode of transportation. Due to the relative simplicity and affordability, a bicycle can be the perfect solution for those who cannot afford the high cost of owning and operating an automobile. Ben is one such person.<br/><br/> I met Ben after seeing him riding his bike through our neighborhood. He rides his bike for several hours each day collecting recyclables all over town. Seeing as he is part of a car-free-family, his bike serves as his primary transportation and in addition to his recycling used for running errands, shopping...etc. This is no easy task seeing as we live in a sprawling suburban community located in an arid region of southern California. A simple trip to the store may be a few miles away. And in the summer, daytime temperatures are consistently in the high 90's and low 100's. <br/><br/> The bike he currently rides was built for a teenage girl and is far too small for his frame. Additionally, the condition is overwhelmingly subpar and it is in great need of repair. Even with this less than ideal setup he manages to collect many large garbage bags (as seen in the picture) worth of recyclables each week. Unfortunately he can only carry one bag at a time on his small, ill-equipped bike. With the recycling center over 5 miles away Ben spends 2-3 days per week making multiple trips back and forth from the recycling center. Imagine riding 30 miles a day to move 3 bags of cans.

<h3> </h3></div>","Hello, my name is Jon. I live in Murrieta, CA. As someone who has been riding bikes of all shapes, sizes, and types throughout the course of my life. I truly believe in the power of cycling. For some, bikes are the perfect way to get out of traffic and make that commute to work a little more tolerable. For others it's a way to squeeze in some exercise without being stuck in the gym, or they can simply be a way to relieve some of that built up stress that so many of us are burdened with. More importantly there is a group within society for which a bike is much more than entertainment or exercise - it is a necessary tool. Many people rely on their bicycle as their primary mode of transportation. Due to the relative simplicity and affordability, a bicycle can be the perfect solution for those who cannot afford the high cost of owning and operating an automobile. Ben is one such person. I met Ben after seeing him riding his bike through our neighborhood. He rides his bike for several hours each day collecting recyclables all over town. Seeing as he is part of a car-free-family, his bike serves as his primary transportation and in addition to his recycling used for running errands, shopping...etc. This is no easy task seeing as we live in a sprawling suburban community located in an arid region of southern California. A simple trip to the store may be a few miles away. And in the summer, daytime temperatures are consistently in the high 90's and low 100's.  The bike he currently rides was built for a teenage girl and is far too small for his frame. Additionally, the condition is overwhelmingly subpar and it is in great need of repair. Even with this less than ideal setup he manages to collect many large garbage bags (as seen in the picture) worth of recyclables each week. Unfortunately he can only carry one bag at a time on his small, ill-equipped bike. With the recycling center over 5 miles away Ben spends 2-3 days per week making multiple trips back and forth from the recycling center. Imagine riding 30 miles a day to move 3 bags of cans. All of this in addition to any normal riding he needed to collect the goods and run errands and such.  I had seen Ben many times but hadn't actually met him until recently when I saw him working on a bike in his driveway and decided to go introduce myself. We chatted about what he does and how things were going. He then mentioned that the bike he was currently working on was one he had picked up so that he could donate to a local food bank in hopes that they could either sell it for profit or donate it to someone who needed it. He said that whenever he comes across a bike someone is trying to get rid of or sell (usually ""for under $5""), that he will do his ""repair and donate"" to try and help out the local community. This was one of the most selfless things I had ever heard and was truly inspiring.

<h1><b>Why have we started Monument?</b></h1>
<p>We are taking more photos than ever. Smartphones, digital cameras and action cams are all around us, and capturing our best memories has become a part of everyday life.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, storing, organizing and accessing these memories is still very difficult, requiring a computer and lots of time. And while cloud services offer a partial solution, we have to pay monthly fees for the rest of our lives. Plus the whole privacy thing.</p>
<p>The tools we need to manage our photos have not evolved at the same pace as our awesome cameras.</p>
<p>We knew there had to be a better way, and we set out to find it with one simple mission:</p>
<p><b>""Make managing our photos and videos as easy as taking them!""</b></p>
<p></p>

<p>The Monument app on iOS and Android automatically transfers photos and videos from your phone to Monument.</p>
<p>By default, syncing starts upon connecting to your home Wi-Fi network. This achieves a faster transfer rate and relieves stress on your smartphone battery. You can also sync your photos and videos when you're away from home by enabling remote syncing in the app settings.</p>
<p>The SD Card slot on Monument accepts standard SD Cards. When a new SD Card is inserted for the first time, a notification is displayed in the app asking you whether the content should be imported. Upon approval, all the content is stored in Monument.</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/364/912/c1749c95cea41aba7d6ff1db6c2d93b3_original.png?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1455568131&amp;auto=format&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=73091f610473584e4f3f20b28ba134cd"" src="""" style=""""/></figure><p></p>
<p>Our advanced AI (Artificial Intelligence) algorithms start organizing all of your content as it is stored on Monument. It sorts everything by date, time, location, cameras as well as faces and what's in a photo.</p>
<p>Since everything is organized, instead of just browsing photos on a simple timeline, Monument provides you multiple ways to view them. </p>
<p></p>

<li>
<b>World Map:</b> Monument displays all your photos on a map. Zoom and pan around to find your most memorable destinations. You don't have to be a globetrotter to use this, but it will look much nicer if you are. </li>

<p>Monument makes it easy to enjoy all of your content on any iOS or android device.</p>
<p>To view your photos and videos on big screen, Monument offers direct HDMI connection to your TV.  </p>

<p>Monument uses external USB drives for storage to give you complete flexibility. You can have as much or as little storage as you need. Below you can see some example configurations and corresponding capacity: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>1 Disk (1TB) - </b>Stores up to 150,000 Photos or 70 hours of video</li>
<li>
<b>2 Disks (2x 1TB) - </b>Stores up to 300,000 Photos or 140 hours of video</li>
<li>
<b>2 Disks (2x 2TB) - </b>Stores up to 600,000 Photos or 280 hours of video</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Calculations are based on photos taken by an entry level DSLR Camera (Using JPEG Fine settings) and videos recorded by an iPhone 6 (1080p at 60fps). Actual figures may vary. <b>2TB is just an example and not a limitation. </b></i></p>
<p>As you need more space by time, you can increase Monument’s capacity by adding another drive or replacing one with a larger model.</p>
<p>Everyone we have talked to loves the idea of flexible storage, and we’re sure you’ll love it, too.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Backups are a must for everyone, but we rarely remember to back up our photos and videos. Monument provides two options to protect your precious data.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Local Backup:</b> You can connect two disk drives that will be used in a RAID-1 configuration, i.e. disks will be mirrored. </li>
<li>
<b>Remote Backup:</b> Monument can back up all data to a remote Monument device over internet using a secure connection.</li>
</ul>

Why have we started Monument?
We are taking more photos than ever. Smartphones, digital cameras and action cams are all around us, and capturing our best memories has become a part of everyday life.
Unfortunately, storing, organizing and accessing these memories is still very difficult, requiring a computer and lots of time. And while cloud services offer a partial solution, we have to pay monthly fees for the rest of our lives. Plus the whole privacy thing.
The tools we need to manage our photos have not evolved at the same pace as our awesome cameras.
We knew there had to be a better way, and we set out to find it with one simple mission:
""Make managing our photos and videos as easy as taking them!""

Monument shown in two alternative colors: black and orange-pink


The Monument app on iOS and Android automatically transfers photos and videos from your phone to Monument.
By default, syncing starts upon connecting to your home Wi-Fi network. This achieves a faster transfer rate and relieves stress on your smartphone battery. You can also sync your photos and videos when you're away from home by enabling remote syncing in the app settings.
The SD Card slot on Monument accepts standard SD Cards. When a new SD Card is inserted for the first time, a notification is displayed in the app asking you whether the content should be imported. Upon approval, all the content is stored in Monument.


Our advanced AI (Artificial Intelligence) algorithms start organizing all of your content as it is stored on Monument. It sorts everything by date, time, location, cameras as well as faces and what's in a photo.
Since everything is organized, instead of just browsing photos on a simple timeline, Monument provides you multiple ways to view them. 




Time Machine: It's a perfect tool to look back on your memories, be it two years or ten years ago. Great for Instagram throwbacks? Yeah, we know!

Favorites: Have something great that you always want to have with you and access quickly? Just fave it, and now it has a special place.

Faces: Quickly view your photos of any specific person. It’s easier than ever to find and enjoy memories of your loved ones.

World Map: Monument displays all your photos on a map. Zoom and pan around to find your most memorable destinations. You don't have to be a globetrotter to use this, but it will look much nicer if you are. 

Cameras: Have more than one camera? See the photos taken with each. Another great way to find what you’re looking for!



Our algorithms analyze your photos to understand what’s in them. So you can find the photo you’re looking for by searching with keywords, such as snow, beach, mountain or outdoor. No manual tagging or organizing required. 


Monument makes it easy to enjoy all of your content on any iOS or android device.
To view your photos and videos on big screen, Monument offers direct HDMI connection to your TV.  

Our prototype connected to a monitor using HDMI.


Monument uses external USB drives for storage to give you complete flexibility. You can have as much or as little storage as you need. Below you can see some example configurations and corresponding capacity: 


1 Disk (1TB) - Stores up to 150,000 Photos or 70 hours of video

2 Disks (2x 1TB) - Stores up to 300,000 Photos or 140 hours of video

2 Disks (2x 2TB) - Stores up to 600,000 Photos or 280 hours of video

Calculations are based on photos taken by an entry level DSLR Camera (Using JPEG Fine settings) and videos recorded by an iPhone 6 (1080p at 60fps). Actual figures may vary. 2TB is just an example and not a limitation. 
As you need more space by time, you can increase Monument’s capacity by adding another drive or replacing one with a larger model.
Everyone we have talked to loves the idea of flexible storage, and we’re sure you’ll love it, too.


Backups are a must for everyone, but we rarely remember to back up our photos and videos. Monument provides two options to protect your precious data.  


Local Backup: You can connect two disk drives that will be used in a RAID-1 configuration, i.e. disks will be mirrored. 

Remote Backup: Monument can back up all data to a remote Monument device over internet using a secure connection.


Monument shown in alternative orange-pink color.


Monument is developed specifically to answer all photo and video management needs. It tries to simplify all the steps involved in managing your photos, namely; storing, organizing, viewing, sharing and making sure they are protected. 
We also wanted to provide users a solution without any strings attached. A solution that will be with them in the long haul.

Using an action cam? Watch this video to see how Monument can help you.

 Using a camera and a smartphone? Watch this to see what Monument can do for you.

 Monument's Artificial Intelligence technology understands the scenes in photos and performs face recognition. Monument is able to classify photographs into classes such as beach, mountains, snow, city, indoor etc. The final list of categories will be later determined.As photos are classified, you can easily search your archives and quickly find your photos.Search functionality in iOS appMonument detects the faces in your photos and our app provides an easy to use interface to manage these faces. Once you teach Monument whose face is whose, it will automatically group your photos according to who is in them. You have full control over which people will be detected by Monument, and you can add or remove people whenever you want.Time Machine - Browse your memories from past years.Browsing photos in World Map.Browsing by faces and by cameras.Our passion for photography and making things inspired us to build the photo management solution of our dreams. In the last year, we have designed, coded and built prototypes to make our vision a reality.  We showcased Monument at CES in January. From start to finish, our booth was packed with visitors. We received great feedback and met many wonderful people throughout the show. They loved Monument, and you will, too.

Prototypes in alternative colors.Test units that have come off the production line.We're a passionate team of eight that has become a family, including industrial designers, electrical engineers, software engineers and UI/UX experts. We embarked on to a mission: to make photo and video management as easy as taking one.We started our journey in Istanbul, and are currently headquartered in beautiful Chicago.

<p>We have selected the brushless motor with excellent heat dissipation structure and sealed it with covers, which can greatly reduce the bearing, motor, and control board contact with water and dust contact. The good performance in reducing the working temperature of the motor will greatly extend the motor life as well.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Powerful Motor, Hill Climbing At Ease</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Powered by a high-performance brushless hub motor, Max C gives you strong brake, fast acceleration, and steep hill climbing. The hub motor can storage electricity when it's on the downhill and convert part of the potential energy to electric energy and avoid damage to the motor caused by overload. Reaching a speed of 15 mph and climbing 20° hills, MAX C is perfect for users looking for a powerful yet affordable way to get around.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">LED Light For Night Rides</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Your safety is our first concern. The hi-power LED headlights and taillights of Max C ensure that you are visible at night to traffic and pedestrians. And it'll be much easier for you to ride at night in a dimly lit sports venues, alleys or tunnels.</p>

El Rincón de ChinaMi PRIMERA VEZ en un SKATE ELÉCTRICO, ¿me mataré? | MAX C   Unibody Design, Incredibly Light The injection-molding technology and unibody design made Max C as sleek and elegant as your favorite skateboard, but she is so much more. Constructed with high strength polymers and premium carbon fiber the board is lightweight, yet strong enough to carry a weight of up to 176lbs/ 80kg. Featuring an integrated handle at the head of the board, Max C's ergonomic design makes it easy to pick up, carry, and store. Its kick-tail deck shape and lightweight hub motor make it easy to go for a cruise, and do some tricks. 
Rugged To Go Anywhere
 

Max C is ready to go everywhere. Its IP65 water & dust proof design shrugs off rain, puddles, dust, and sand.

We have selected the brushless motor with excellent heat dissipation structure and sealed it with covers, which can greatly reduce the bearing, motor, and control board contact with water and dust contact. The good performance in reducing the working temperature of the motor will greatly extend the motor life as well.

No you didn't just travel through time. Stop freaking out..Couponomy is revolutionizing the loyalty market by utilizing a proprietary point distribution process (patent pending) that creates a marketing effect unlike any other. Customers share loyalty points and transaction activity with a potentially limitless network of friends.Here are some samples of our progress...Our MissionThe story of Couponomy began like most, with a dream - a dream of a world connecting and cooperating effortlessly.Our goal was to create a method where purchases could generate loyalty for both themselves and their friends, spreading both awareness and incentive to more people, encouraging more spending, and sharing more loyalty.As consumers, our experiences with deal and loyalty programs have been tiresome at best. Email blasts from daily deal sites clog our inboxes and loyalty cards clog our wallets. Couponomy addresses these issues with a fun, simple, and most importantly, free mobile application. With Couponomy, you can make purchases and earn loyalty points all from your smartphone while automatically sharing and earning points with your friends. We always want to know where our friends eat, shop, and spend. Other than serving as a shared, viral loyalty program, Couponomy acts as a more targeted recommendation application, since you earn points from your friends, automatically opting you into that specific venue’s loyalty network.  Who wouldn’t want to be rewarded for their friends’ loyalty? WE TOTALLY WOULD.What business wouldn’t want to access and attract their loyal customers' friends? You are the missing piece of the puzzle! Are you a business?Here's Where YOU Come In!Your support and pledges will advance our development and marketing budget to push beyond BETA and into the market.

It is obvious that we will not be able to rely on fossil fuels in the future. Because of this reason we have to find alternative energy sources and also integrate them into the worldwide energy production. But not only we need new energy sources, we will also be in need of new ways and gadgets to use the power. This is exactly why the four of us chose to focus on the construction of a high-efficiency electric motor, because the car of tomorrow is very likely to be either a hybrid car, a combination of a combustion engine and an electric motor, or a vehicle which will be fully driven by electric energy.</p><h2>Background</h2><div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We are a
group of four very passionate students in the field of electrical engineering, who
are trying to show the nearly endless possibilitys concerning the newest
generation of electric engines. Our team consists of Aisha, Stefan, Frederick
and myself, Mike. All of us are currently in our last year at the higher
technical collage in Bad Radkersburg/Austria and our graduation is nearing
closer. As our diploma thesis, our task is to construct and build a brushless
dc machine and to dimension and design the required power electronics. As a
result, our motor will be used as the drivetrain for our E-GoKart.</p>
</div>
<p>For us, this is a quite big project and we consider
this as our contribution referring to the turnaround in energy policy.</p>
<p>Our school is quite small and thus our budget is
very low. Because of the high costs – especially concerning the accumulators –
we would be very happy if we could count on this community´s help to fulfill
our important project. </p>
<h2><b>Our Project</b></h2>

<h2><b>Costs</b></h2>
<p>Like already mentioned before, our school really
lacks on the financial matters to contribute our research project. The
accumulators of our GoKart are the most expensive parts of our project, 60
cells of a lithium-ion iron-phosphate accumulator make up ~3700€ (~5000$).
Furthermore the accumulators need a special loading device, current sensors, a
control display and special balancer modules, which cost altogether about 600€
(~820$). To control the physical data like RPM Torque Power temperature of the
motor we need some controllers and displays which cost approximately 50€
(~70$). But the mechanical construction is the more expensive part. For example
the lasering of the stack of shields was about 350€ (~480$), milling the end
shields of our motor 150€ (~200$), manufacturing the rotor of the motor costs
about 250€ (~340$), the 16 permanent magnets of our rotor about 200€ (~270$)
and the chassis 650€ (~$880). </p><p><br/></p>

<div style=""text-align:center;font-size:x-large;"">The I-Jet™</div>
<p style=""width: 100%;text-align: justify;text-indent: 5%;""><b>Not Another Flying Car!</b> That is the reaction many people have to our I-Jet™. But a flying car is by definition a vehicle designed to travel at speed on roads and in the air, a car that flies. Being neither fish nor fowl they are always bad cars and even worse aircraft and the cost to buy and operate these toys for the rich ensure that they will never replace the automobile. While the I-Jet™ can taxi at slow speed it never needs to travel at speed on the ground although it could close to the ground on a cushion of air over rough or soft surfaces.</p>
<p style=""width: 100%;text-align: justify;text-indent: 5%;""><b>What then is an I-Jet™?</b> Just another one of the hundreds of electric drones that we hear about every day? No, the I-Jet™ is a fundamentally different form of transportation. Based on new breakthroughs in ion propulsion in the atmosphere, AIP, the I-Jet™ has the potential to revolutionize transportation as we know it and take us to the fifth level of civilization.</p>
<p style=""width: 100%;text-align: justify;text-indent: 5%;""><b>Isn't ion propulsion just science fiction?</b> No it is not but most ""so called"" experts will tell you that it is impractical due to its low thrust and terrible efficiency. That is the almost insurmountable obstacle that hampers AIP development. It is to dispell these misconceptions that the lengthy discussion that follows is necessary. Since there really are no ""experts"" who posess the knowledge we have gained in our 15 years of research who can advise you, the only way for you a potential supporter to understand that ion propulsion in the atmosphere is truly within our grasp is to read what we have provided below.</p>
<p style=""width: 100%;text-align: justify;text-indent: 5%;""><b>Why is the development of AIP and the I-Jet™ so important</b>. Because of all the endlessly proposed flying vehicles only the I-Jet™ can replace the automobile. By moving all transportation off the ground into the air with nothing to obstruct the view, all accidents can be avoided saving over a million human lives and a billion animal lives each year. In addition, if you believe in global warming, the I-Jet™ because it emits no CO<sub>2</sub>, when it does replace the automobile it will ensure that every country that has pledged to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions will meet their goals because it will happen without them taking any action and it will cost them absolutely nothing.</p>
<p style=""width: 100%;text-align: justify;text-indent: 5%;""><b>What is next?</b> While saving lives and undoing all the dammage done to the planet by the automobile are the two most important reasons why the I-Jet™ must be developed, there are so many more reasons as we show in the discussion below. That is why we are now requesting your support to begin the design and construction of an actual I-Jet™ prototype. If we are successful, all that you see below will happen because economics rules and the I-Jet™ will cost less to buy and operate than today's automobile.</p>

As to safety we only have the safety record of the V22 Osprey compared to a helicopter to asses the safety of these vehicles and they are comparable.

The short take-off and landing capability could not match the zero take-off and landing capabilities of the helicopter. It would appear that the only advantage of the Pal-V is the ability to fold the rotor into a smaller space. Gyroplane safety is a hotly debated issue but the consensus seems to be that they are less safe than even a helicopter. The spinning rotor is also a hazard to those outside the vehicle and thus the vehicle must be segregated from people on the ground while in operation.</p></td></tr>

The I-Jet™
Not Another Flying Car! That is the reaction many people have to our I-Jet™. But a flying car is by definition a vehicle designed to travel at speed on roads and in the air, a car that flies. Being neither fish nor fowl they are always bad cars and even worse aircraft and the cost to buy and operate these toys for the rich ensure that they will never replace the automobile. While the I-Jet™ can taxi at slow speed it never needs to travel at speed on the ground although it could close to the ground on a cushion of air over rough or soft surfaces.
What then is an I-Jet™? Just another one of the hundreds of electric drones that we hear about every day? No, the I-Jet™ is a fundamentally different form of transportation. Based on new breakthroughs in ion propulsion in the atmosphere, AIP, the I-Jet™ has the potential to revolutionize transportation as we know it and take us to the fifth level of civilization.
Isn't ion propulsion just science fiction? No it is not but most ""so called"" experts will tell you that it is impractical due to its low thrust and terrible efficiency. That is the almost insurmountable obstacle that hampers AIP development. It is to dispell these misconceptions that the lengthy discussion that follows is necessary. Since there really are no ""experts"" who posess the knowledge we have gained in our 15 years of research who can advise you, the only way for you a potential supporter to understand that ion propulsion in the atmosphere is truly within our grasp is to read what we have provided below.
Why is the development of AIP and the I-Jet™ so important. Because of all the endlessly proposed flying vehicles only the I-Jet™ can replace the automobile. By moving all transportation off the ground into the air with nothing to obstruct the view, all accidents can be avoided saving over a million human lives and a billion animal lives each year. In addition, if you believe in global warming, the I-Jet™ because it emits no CO2, when it does replace the automobile it will ensure that every country that has pledged to reduce CO2 emissions will meet their goals because it will happen without them taking any action and it will cost them absolutely nothing.
What is next? While saving lives and undoing all the dammage done to the planet by the automobile are the two most important reasons why the I-Jet™ must be developed, there are so many more reasons as we show in the discussion below. That is why we are now requesting your support to begin the design and construction of an actual I-Jet™ prototype. If we are successful, all that you see below will happen because economics rules and the I-Jet™ will cost less to buy and operate than today's automobile.
So take your time. Read what we have presented below. If you have further questions contact us either by e-mail here on Indiegogo or go to our website at https://charged-motion.com.
Donations. Those who donate will be placed on the I-Jet priority list for lease or purchase when and if I-Jets™ become available. Note also that donations can be given as gifts and will place both the Donor and gift recipient on the I-Jet priority list.

  We begin our story with this short clip from Star Trek the original series first broadcast in 1968.  But it was not just in our popular culture that the myth that efficient high thrust ion propulsion is always beyond our grasp. The few researchers still in the field will all tell you that ion propulsion in the atmosphere is impractical due to exceedingly low thrust and low efficiency. We at Charged Motion, after fifteen years of research believe that this is no longer true; that we are on the brink of making high-thrust high-efficiency ion propulsion in the atmosphere a reality.

 What is ion propulsion?Ion propulsion was first mentioned in 1905 by Dr. Robert Goddard the father of modern rocketry who filed the first ion propulsion patent over one hundred years ago in 1917. For those interested, a brief history of Ion Propulsion can be found at the end of this presentation. This next clip shows how ion propulsion works. Ion engines have the following advantages over conventional mechanical methods of producing thrust such as piston and jet engines and electric motors.  

1.
Light weight:
—
An ion engine can consist of a few ounces of light weight aluminum or other conductive material attached to the vehicle adding little to the weight and cost of a vehicle.


2.
Vectored thrust:
—
An ion engine can apply different voltages to multiple electrodes changing the magnitude and direction of its thrust without using any costly, complex and unreliable electromechanical or hydraulic actuators.


3
Low temperature operation:
—
An ion engine's exhaust temperature at full output is only a few degrees higher than its input temperature.


4
Response time:
—
An ion engine can go from zero to maximum thrust in a few microseconds and can vector that thrust just as quickly..


5
No moving parts:
—
An ion engine has no moving parts making it far more reliable than any other means of propulsion.

 It is these five characteristics of an ion engine in the atmosphere that give an ion propelled vehicle its extraordinary capabilities.If ion propulsion in the atmosphere does succeed, what will it mean for you and your family? The I-Jet    Because it isn't obvious why the five characteristics of atmospheric ion engines when applied to a vehicle can so change the world, we have created a design study vehicle that we call an I-Jet™. The capabilities of this vehicle are based on simulations of our patented breakthrough ion propulsion technology. While theoretically almost 90% efficiency is possible, the following design study is very conservative and uses an overall thermodynamic efficiency of the ion engine of only 25%. SizeThe I-Jet is no larger than a conventional automobile, has vertical take-off and landing capabilities, and will fit in your garage.SpeedUnlike propeller and jet engines, an ion engine has no theoretical limit to the speed it can achieve. It is strictly a matter of the power available and the drag of the vehicle. While the cost of current electrical power sources will make the I-Jet™ subsonic for most applications, when cheaper and more powerful electrical sources are developed or when cost is no object, supersonic and even hyper-sonic aircraft should be possible.MileageBecause it uses vectored thrust instead of aerodynamic control surfaces and has 1/10th the drag of an automobile at sea level and 1/100th the drag at 50,000 feet, from the speed graph above, it should be capable of speeds exceeding 450 miles per hour or have a range exceeding 1500 miles per GGE (gasoline gallon equivalent) and with a 20 GGE fuel capacity, it should have intercontinental range.Speed vs. MileageUnlike vehicles powered by mechanical devices which usually have one speed that gives maximum mileage, an ion engine's mileage increases linearly the slower you go until you drop out of the sky. For this reason the user can select whether an I-Jet™ travels 10 times faster than an automobile or ten times farther.

SafetyWith fly by wire computer control, external sensors, low temperature operation, and no moving parts it should be possible to create a zero-accident zero-fatality vehicle. With proper design because of the almost negligible added weight of redundant ion engine electrodes, should any system fail, the I-Jet™ can still make an emergency horizontal landings using small backup batteries or other electrical source.CostBecause our I-Jet™ will obtain its power from a 200 kw fuel cell that currently costs about $11,000, we believe that I-Jets could be manufactured today to sell for less than $25,000 and as volume increases and fuel cell prices continue to fall, for under $15,000. This is less than the price of the average automobile. As ion propulsion efficiency increases above 25% and the size of the fuel cell decreases, the cost will decrease even more.This graph below was published in 2012 by the US Department of Energy. It showed the anticipated reduction in cost per kilowatt from 2006 to 2017. The actual cost in 2017 is now $53/kw so the projections were very optimistic. Currently the DOE's goals are $47/kw by 2020 with $30/kw still their eventual goal. These projections and the current $53/kw are for volumes of 100,000 units or more. The I-Jet™ with demand in the millions could completely change the curve by dropping costs much faster.Cost to OperateMany of the operating costs associated with operating an automobile should be greatly reduced if not eliminated with the I-Jet™. With no moving parts and no lubrication needed maintenance costs should be almost eliminated. Licenses should no longer be necessary since the user is not flying the vehicle. Registration will be a one time occurrence included in the cost of the vehicle. Since an I-Jet does not use roads or any other infrastructure and cannot ""break the law"", so that police resources are no longer required for transportation, the fuel tax which is almost 1/4 the cost of the fuel itself can be eliminated. If the I-Jet™ is truly a zero-accident zero-fatality vehicle insurance could also be eliminated. Whether these costs are eliminated is a political issue not a technical one.With the I-Jet™ the actual cost of fuel to fly could be less than 7.5% of the automobile's fuel cost and the I-Jet™'s total operating costs could be less than one quarter that of the automobile''s total operating costs.Pilot's LicenseBecause the ion engine has vectored thrust capability that can be controlled directly by a computer without expensive mechanical or hydraulic linkages, what is known as fly by wire can be implemented at no additional cost. With fly by wire, it is the computer that flys the I-Jet™, the user simply tells the computer where it wants to go and how fast. The I-Jet™ is a truly autonomous vehicle and because it operates above the ground clutter, collision avoidance can be guaranteed. Since the user is not flying the vehicle, no pilots license will be required and in fact it will take less skill to operate than an automobile.No Moving PartsOnce in the air the I-Jet™ will fly without any moving parts because the ion engine has no moving parts. You are literally flying on a cushion of air.Dynamic StabilityBecause the ion engine's response time is so fast and the I-Jet™ can be designed to provide vectored thrust in any direction, dynamic stability is easily implemented. With dynamic stability an ion engine instantaneously provides an opposing thrust to any outside force on the vehicle. Turbulence and wind shear will not be felt by the passengers and if the vehicle is built strong enough it could fly through a tornado with the occupants feeling nothing.All Weather CapabilityDynamic stability will make the I-Jet™ a completely safe all weather aircraft.The I-Jet is not a Flying CarWhile the I-Jet™ can replace the automobile everywhere it is not a flying car. The reason why many people are designing flying cars is because these vehicles cannot operate safely in the air in bad weather and if they are to continue a trip safely in bad weather they must land and use conventional roads. Because the I-Jet™ can travel safely in any weather to any destination, travel on roads is never necessary.How long will it take?That will depend on the level of funding we obtain here and elsewhere. If there is sufficient funding we believe the simulator and prototype simulations will take between one and two years. Construction of a prototype can begin as soon as the simulator verifies the prototype engine performance, hopefully within a year. Due to the simplicity of the I-Jet and with sufficient further funding, construction of the prototype should be completed within a year after verification of the engine. Exhaustive testing and necessary government approvals will take at least three years. But during testing, again with sufficient funding, the final production I-Jet can be designed and production started so that deliveries can be made as soon as testing and approvals are complete. You could be traveling in an I-Jet in five to seven years.The Electrostatic Propulsion Consortium (EPC)As soon as possible Charged Motion, Inc will sponsor a conference inviting the leading automotive and aerospace companies to discuss the creation of The Electrostatic Propulsion Consortium, the EPC. The purpose of the Consortium is to bring together as many resources as possible in an effort to accellerate Atmospheric Ion Propulsion development. Through the EPC Charged Motion hopes to build a level playing field where all member companies and universities on an equal basis can initially obtain licensing to Charged Motion's intellectual property and in time all intellectual property of the EPC and all intellectual property that the EPC has a right to sub-license. The goal of the EPC is to save as many lives as possible both by accelerating AIP development and by removing any incentive for any licensee to cut corners on safety. The EPC will set absolute safety standards that all licensees will have to meet. These safety standards are not intended to replace governmental safety regulations but are instead intended to set higher safety standards when necessary.I-Jet or Automobile

Summary: Vertical lift propellers without the benefit of wings are the most inefficient means of travel. Projected fatality rate is unknown but is probably close to that of a helicopter, 27 times greater per mile and 85 times greater per hour for non-commercial travel. But they also are a real threat to people and property outside the vehicle. Would you rather be kneecapped or beheaded?

Summary: Electric tilt-rotor aircraft like all battery powered aircraft have limited range due to the low energy density of batteries, less than 200 Wh/kg versus 12,000 Wh/kg for gasoline. Assuming 85% efficiency for electric motors and 20% efficiency for internal combustion engines, you can travel 14 times farther with a gasoline internal combustion engine than an equivalent electric motor. As to safety we only have the safety record of the V22 Osprey compared to a helicopter to asses the safety of these vehicles and they are comparable. If the fans are ducted then they will be safer for those outside the vehicle otherwise the vehicle must be segregated from people on the ground while in operation.

Summary: Gyroplanes were never accepted by the public because the rotor caused more drag than a conventional aircraft wing of comparable lift and could not achieve the speeds that a conventional airplane could. The short take-off and landing capability could not match the zero take-off and landing capabilities of the helicopter. It would appear that the only advantage of the Pal-V is the ability to fold the rotor into a smaller space. Gyroplane safety is a hotly debated issue but the consensus seems to be that they are less safe than even a helicopter. The spinning rotor is also a hazard to those outside the vehicle and thus the vehicle must be segregated from people on the ground while in operation.

Summary: Ducted fans while much safer than open spinning blades are also generally less efficient. But the main safety issues with all of these vehicles is that if an engine fails, the vehicle is lost. It is for this reason that most of these vehicles have an on-board vehicle parachute. But these parachutes generally need at least 200 feet of altitude to properly deploy so that there is this window on take-offs and landings where the vehicle and pilot are at risk.

Summary: Paragliders are generally low speed recreational aircraft and can't compete with other designs with regard to speed and distance and as the Skyrunner shows, they are not cheap. While there is no safety information on these types of vehicles, it would seem at best that they would not be any safer than other general aviation aircraft. The spinning propeller could also be a hazard to people outside the vehicle.

Summary: The I-Jet's ion propulsion engine solves all of the problems that limit these mechanical devices.

1.
Range
There are three reasons for the extreme range of the I-Jet; A) thrust efficiency, moving more air for a given thrust, B) thrust efficiency increases linearly as thrust decreases, and C) the low drag of the I-Jet because of the elimination of all aerodynamic control surfaces due to the vectored and multi-axis thrust of the ion engines.


2.
Speed
There are three reasons for the high speeds of the I-Jet; A) thrust efficiency, moving more air for a given thrust, B) thrust can be increased by using higher power fuel cells, and C) the low drag of the I-Jet because of the elimination of all aerodynamic control surfaces due to the vectored and multi-axis thrust of the ion engines.


3.
Cost
The low cost of an I-Jet is due to its simplicity, a pod with a fuel cell and a few hundred parts vs the thousands in an automobile, and when it replaces the automobile as the dominant form of transportation, production quantities in the millions exceeding even that of the automobile today will further lower costs.


4.
Safety
The low temperature operation and no moving parts greatly enhances safety for both the I-Jet user and those on the ground. To create an independent redundant engine simply add additional electrodes next to the original electrodes and because the I-Jet has wings, horizontal landings can still be made using a small emergency battery for power. In addition, the I-Jet's dynamic stabilization, all weather flying capability, and collision avoidance sensors will eliminate all in flight hazards.


5.
Wildlife
The only way to protect wildlife is to move transportation off the ground and eliminate as much ground travel as possible. Only the I-Jet can make an appreciable dent in ground transportation because of its all weather flight capability.


6.
Pollution
If the fuel used is hydrogen that is generated from non CO2 sources, emissions will be zero. If other fuels are used, emissions will still be reduced up to a factor of ten per mile traveled due to the I-Jet's greater gas mileage.




As the table shows, there has been so much time, money, and, effort expended by all these extremely creative, talented, and dedicated people trying to make the dream of flight available to all. But the physics of current mechanical devices limits what can be done. These devices are the fourth generation of flying vehicles. The I-Jet is the fifth.So which would be your next vehicle if you could choose? Could the Automobile survive the I-Jet? Could any of the flying vehicles in the table above survive the I-Jet. We don't think so. How long it takes until you can purchase your own I-Jet is up to you.The FutureFlying cars are not the future and we certainly hope that self-driving cars will not be the future either. Flying cars are too expensive and very dangerous and self-driving cars solve none of the issues facing modern transportation except perhaps in time, some improvement in safety. But all the mechanical flying cars which for most people will never be afordable and all the self-driving cars stuck on the ground will never compete with the I-Jet. The I-Jet will be much cheaper to own and operate than any alternative and economics rules.If you have not watched our campaign video we suggest that you do so to see just what the fifth level of civilization will be like if and when atmospheric ion propulsion becomes the dominant form of transportation. If we are able to achieve 25% thermodynamic efficiency and our simulations indicate that we can, then all that is shown in the video will happen in the very near future.Why You Should DonateHow the I-Jet will Benefit YouAll that we have shown above should be reason enough for you to donate to this campaign. Nothing we can forsee in the area of transportation will benefit you and your family as much as the I-Jet will. Fly from your home coast to coast in six hours or New York to Paris in nine hours in complete safety at a cost under $50. The cost of shipping goods and material will be decreased by a factor of ten and these savings will be passed on to you the consumer. But the single most important reason for you to support us is the elimination of all transportation related deaths and injuries.Benefit WildlifeIf you care about wildlife and the environment, nothing you could support could begin to approach the benefits to wildlife that the I-Jet will provide by eliminating over a billion animal deaths a year worldwide and, as roads are phased out, greatly reducing habitat fragmentation.Eliminate PollutionIf you care about atmospheric pollution the I-Jet will eliminate all transportation related atmospheric pollutants including CO2. Also, it does not matter which side of the Climate Change debate you are on, the I-Jet really will be the only practical way to reach the targeted transportation related CO2 reductions because of the continued low cost of fossil fuels, all without costing the tens of trillions of dollars that current plans entail.Eliminate Poverty in the Third WorldIf you care about poverty in third world countries you should support us. Because the I-Jet requires no roads or other infrastructure except fueling stations, the I-Jet really is the only way to bring third world countries that cannot afford the massive cost of modern transportation into the modern world.Offer You New Thrills and AdventuresIf all these reasons are not enough then consider all the thrills and adventures you and your children can experience when in a few years you own an I-Jet.Further InformationWho we are.A brief history of Ion Propulsion.Introduction to Transportation Issues.Transportation Issues Part 1: Conventional SolutionsTransportation Issues Part 2: Proposed SolutionsTransportation Issues Part 3: The I-Jet",25.0,20,"1 Campaign
