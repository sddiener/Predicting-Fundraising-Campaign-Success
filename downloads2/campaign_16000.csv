<h3>Chi siamo - Who we are</h3>
<p>Siamo una chiesa valdese. I valdesi sono protestanti che hanno le loro radici in epoca medievale, prima della Riforma Protestante del 1517. Oggi ci sono circa 25000 valdesi in Italia, sparsi in un centinaio di chiese nel paese. Nel mondo, la chiesa valdese è presente in Svizzera, negli Stati Uniti d'America (North Carolina), Uruguay e Argentina.</p>
<p>We are a Waldensian church. The Waldensians are a protestant denomination tracing back its origins to the Middle ages, before the Reformation. Today there are about 25.000 Waldesians in Italy, spread across a hundred churches around the country. In the world, the Waldesian Church is present in Switzerland, the United States (North Carolina), Uruguay and Argentina.</p>

<p>La nostra chiesa ha sede a Bobbio Pellice, un piccolo centro di circa 500 abitanti situato in alta Val Pellice sulle Alpi del Piemonte. Il paese sorge nel cuore delle Valli valdesi, ai confini con la Francia. È circondato dai boschi, dai pascoli e da montagne ricche di storia.</p>
<p>Our church is located in Bobbio Pellice, a small town of about 500 inhabitants at the very heart of the Waldesian Valleys. It is situated in the north-west corner of Italy about 35 miles west of Turin and close to the French border. The Valleys rise from the plain and finally lose themselves in the rocky heights of the Alps. They are beautiful and full of history, with their lower reaches covered with chestnut woods and their upper slopes covered with alpine pastures.</p>

<h3>Di cosa abbiamo bisogno &amp; cosa ottieni - What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Nel novembre 2017 abbiamo acquistato un organo Walcker 11/II+P che abbiamo successivamente montato e restaurato grazie all'opera sapiente dell'organaro Mario Marzi, ma abbiamo notato che alcune parti erano seriamente danneggiate e quindi da riparare o da sostituire. L'organo è stato originariamente costruito nel 1951 ed è dotato di due tastiere, pedaliera e 11 registri, ci sono solo una trentina di organi in tutta Italia di questo tipo, tra cui uno nella Basilica di San Pietro nella Città del Vaticano. Inoltre, a dicembre 2017 la tradizione di costruzione di organi e musica per organo in Germania è stata inclusa dall'UNESCO nella lista del Patrimonio Culturale Immateriale dell'Umanità.</p>
<p>In November 2017 Bobbio Pellice's Waldensian church in Italy, bought a Walcker 11/II+P mechanical pipe organ.  It was built in 1951 and it has two keyboards, pedals, eleven organ stops and four diapasons. It comes from the Evangelical church of Pforzheim, in Germany. The organ was assembled by the organ builder Mario Marzi. Later we found out that some parts were badly damaged and in need of repair. We are now looking for help to fund the restoration that has since been carried out.</p>

<h3>The context</h3>
<p>Vast plains covered by low stone hills as far as the eye can see.

Projector and white screen in order to use during workshops, presentations, movie nights and other educational-leisure activities in the new creative room.

Music equipment (i.e. loudspeaker) and computers to implement IT courses and develop internet literacy among the youngest generation.

Board games, computer games, literature and textbooks in Georgian and foreign languages, DVD movies, stationary materials, maps so youngsters can use to play and spend quality time with their friends.

Now, Theater2020 presents the first NYC revival of the Sondheim/ Lapine musical Sondheim on Sondheim, a revue that brings many of this musical genius' works together to create quite a show in itself. With a magnificent cast that makes harmonizing within a Sondheim score a) possible and b) seem absurdly effortless, director David Fuller brings a very noteworthy production to audiences who, whether or not they were familiar with Sondheim to begin with, will wind up loving him.</p><p>Finding a cast and crew that can captivate the audience's attention scene after scene, whether that be actors feeding off the energy of each other, or perhaps an ideal light design that so does well to follow the ebb and flow of the moods they set. Fuller and Jarosz have gathered such a beautifully talented cast - and it's no wonder, as this award-winning duo has consistently brought quality theater to the borough.

Under the direction of David Fuller, this very talented cast perfectly combines the whimsicality of a fairy-tale world with the reality of morality and consequence... you do not want to miss the beauty that is Theater 2020's <i><strong>Into the Woods</strong></i>... Theater 2020's touch brings an added vitality to this show that not only speaks wonders of its professional quality, but also brings a phenomenal cast that actually appears happy to tell this story to the stage... Under Fuller's direction, both the subtle comedic and more dominant dramatic sides of this plot are handed over to us in perfect balance; we are very receptive to the plot's dark undertone, but this cast easily brings the story to a cohesive, satisfying whole. This cast utterly shines... this production proves that a wonderful show depends on how well an audience can admire the efforts of those who capture their attention for almost three hours; this cast are collective masters at doing just that - an added plus, they do it extremely well!""</p><p><strong>Theater 2020, Visions for a new Millennium </strong>is guided by award winning theater artists David Fuller and Judith Jarosz who have produced and directed well over a hundred shows, Regionally, Off Broadway, and in NYC’s Indie Theatre (Off Off Broadway).

With a magnificent cast that makes harmonizing within a Sondheim score a) possible and b) seem absurdly effortless, director David Fuller brings a very noteworthy production to audiences who, whether or not they were familiar with Sondheim to begin with, will wind up loving him.Finding a cast and crew that can captivate the audience's attention scene after scene, whether that be actors feeding off the energy of each other, or perhaps an ideal light design that so does well to follow the ebb and flow of the moods they set. Fuller and Jarosz have gathered such a beautifully talented cast - and it's no wonder, as this award-winning duo has consistently brought quality theater to the borough. And I can say with confidence that there is little chance of anyone ever being disappointed by what will come next.""BROADWAY WORLD REVIEW: Theater 2020's Into the Woods:""Theater 2020, the only professional theater troupe in Brooklyn Heights, once again proves itself as a force to be reckoned with with this lovely production of Into the Woods; theirs is a force that brings with it the power and influence a dramatic performance ought to have. The group's past productions of other Sondheim favorites - from Sweeney Todd to Assassins (both of which I was fortunate to see) - established this group one that can bring the gift of theater by means of professionalism and extreme talent... Under the direction of David Fuller, this very talented cast perfectly combines the whimsicality of a fairy-tale world with the reality of morality and consequence... you do not want to miss the beauty that is Theater 2020's Into the Woods... Theater 2020's touch brings an added vitality to this show that not only speaks wonders of its professional quality, but also brings a phenomenal cast that actually appears happy to tell this story to the stage... Under Fuller's direction, both the subtle comedic and more dominant dramatic sides of this plot are handed over to us in perfect balance; we are very receptive to the plot's dark undertone, but this cast easily brings the story to a cohesive, satisfying whole. This cast utterly shines... this production proves that a wonderful show depends on how well an audience can admire the efforts of those who capture their attention for almost three hours; this cast are collective masters at doing just that - an added plus, they do it extremely well!""Theater 2020, Visions for a new Millennium is guided by award winning theater artists David Fuller and Judith Jarosz who have produced and directed well over a hundred shows, Regionally, Off Broadway, and in NYC’s Indie Theatre (Off Off Broadway). They have been recognized with multiple awards and nominations including The National GLAAD awards, OOBR Awards, NYtheatre.com People of the Year, and New York Innovative Theater Awards.We believe live performance is an important part of a healthy culture and we are committed to diversity, remaining dedicated to our multi-cultural Brooklyn audiences and artists alike.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>During the COVID pandemic, I wrote a ballet story,<i> The Prince of Barykova</i>. It is a modern fairy tale about a prince who takes a trip around the world to find his wife/soulmate. It is supposed to be danced in the style of a romantic ballet and set to rock music instead of classical music. My intention is to create a new ballet tradition; <i>The Nutcracker</i> ballet is a part of the American Christmas tradition and I am hoping <i>The Prince of Barykova</i> becomes a part of the American Easter tradition. </p>
<p>The ballet will be on stage in New York City in April 2022. The world premiere will be on Nightglow's YouTube channel during the Easter season in April 2022. And it will be posted on YouTube every year afterwards in celebration of Easter.</p>
<p>To tell you a little about myself: I am the founder of <i>Nightglow Entertainment</i>. It's mission: to remember forgotten stories, to tell stories no one else has told before, and for these stories to achieve immortality through performing and multi-disciplinary art forms. The first project under the Nightglow brand was <i>The Charioteer of Rome</i> in which I directed, produced, and self-financed. As a self-published play, it became the performing arts finalist of the 11th annual NIEA (National Indie Excellence Awards) and has already been translated into Spanish.<br/> </p>

But it wasn’t until hearing my partner’s sad, strange psychedelic dream about his time spent in Abidjan that I felt compelled to feed him a few drinks and record him casually describing it to me. I then created a soundscape and painted dozens of colorful cardboard puppets to illustrate it, and myself and performers attempted to illustrate it in real time with the puppets as the recording played. This first experiment was called Weird Dream Project and it was performed for Puppet Parlor at HERE Arts Center back in December 2019. Around the same time, The Human Dream Project was accepted into St. Ann’s Puppet Lab where an incredible amount of development and transformation happened with the project, due in no small part to the fact that Puppet Lab was indefinitely extended throughout the pandemic. So since Weird Dream Project, I have built many intricate puppets, stop motion animations, and other video-art projects based upon real people's dreams that have debuted online as well as pieces yet to be released. </p><p>Then this spring I was asked by Opus 40 if I had a work I’d like to present there this season (Live!

Luckily, I received a Creative Capital Artist’s Relief Grant to help me through the worst of the pandemic, I still have the developmental support of St. Ann's Puppet Lab, and the incredible group of artists that I am lucky to have pulled together for this work has had The Freight residency to help us explore and expand our concepts, ideas, puppets, setpieces and styles to develop this show for the outdoor Opus 40 iteration and beyond.

We live to create prescient, impactful works of art to share with the world to connect humans in a way that enriches the common good and helps us all understand and find beauty and meaning in life. This project seeks to connect humans from all backgrounds, binaries and nationalities through our deepest internal hopes, fears and natural creative genius. Thank you so much for helping us create this ever expanding collective work.HOW CAN I SEE IT?Tickets are on sale now for our Opus 40 production at https://opus40.org/human-dream-project/, and more tickets for upcoming productions will be available in the fall!OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP- Please help spread the word not only about our fundraiser, but about The Human Dream Project so that we can share it with as many Humans as possible! - If you have a dream you would like to share that may have a possibility of becoming part of The Human Dream Project, go to the Facebook Group ""Dream Bank"" at https://www.facebook.com/groups/thehumandreampr... and contribute your strange, sad, weird, funny, wonderful little-big piece of natural creative genius!A FEW THINGS WE WANT YOU TO KNOW- The Human Dream Project is all about inclusivity and creating true and honest connection across human-made binaries and boundaries- The Human Dream Project uses repurposed materials whenever possible and is as ecologically conscious as we can be capable of given the small level of our production- The Human Dream Project strives for all performances to serve all bodies, whether able-bodied or challenged- The Human Dream Project is deeply interested in finding ways to perform for groups that aren't usually exposed to/can't afford/don't have access to art and new theater/performance. Please reach out if you are part of an organization that can facilitate this or wants to work with us and hopefully we can work something out.Thank you for being a supporter of The Human Dream Project!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Flux Vertical Theatre has finally found a home. We just signed a lease on a 4,000 sq ft building in Berkeley California and we are proud to announce that we will be opening up our very first alternative dance studio and performance space.</p>
<p>We have a lot of work ahead of us since we are building our perfect studio with a stage from scratch. We have a solid foundation and now all we need is a little help from our friends. Every donation will go towards creating the most beautiful space to dance in and entertain you. </p>
<p>We are dedicated to bringing you world class pole and dance instruction and are excited to feature incredible talent and skills from all genres of pole. Our focus is cultivating dancers who want to reach the spotlight and we are committed to instituting a supportive, safe and diverse community where we are all free to express ourselves. </p>
<p>In order for Flux Vertical Theatre to open its doors, there are some things we need your help with right now: keep reading for more info, pick a perk and contribute, then spread the word. We are so excited about this space. It has been a long journey already and we can’t wait to one day sit back and kick our stilettos up and look at all the glorious community around us!</p>
<p>We would be honored to feel your love and support in this dream of ours. </p>
<p>Thanks for being a supporter of the Bay Area pole and dance community!</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Our WHO</h2>
<p>For those of you who don't know us, Flux Vertical Theatre is a Bay Area dance company specializing in the art of pole, founded by Kirsten (aka Mz. K) and Leah Marie. For the past 6 years we have been dancing our way through the Bay Area and beyond with high quality performances and incredible talent. Our company member's and performers come from unique backgrounds ranging from classical and contemporary styles of dance, gymnastics, theater and circus arts. Our mission is to inspire and entertain you through our collaborative work, united by our love of Pole. </p>
<p>We have been dreaming of one day having a studio of our own to rehearse in and that day has finally come. Our new Flux Vertical Theatre Academy will allow us to train our future pole stars and will also provide a gorgeous stage for us all to perform on. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Without our dancers and our fans, Flux Vertical Theatre would be nothing.</strong></p>
<p>We count on all our supporters to show up constantly and we demand a lot of our artists as well. We are so lucky to have this incredible community and we are excited to give back!</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627112717/onuzgz8e7sannvnwnxiz.jpg"" src=""""/></h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Our WHAT</h2>
<p>Our goal is to create an all encompassing, amazing and diverse community under one roof. So what does that look like? Well, it looks like this:</p>
<p><strong>ONE PART Academy</strong>: Our academy students will learn from top notch dancers and choreographers and will be rewarded with stage time. That’s right, if your dream is to be in the spotlight then this is the program for you!</p>
<p><strong>ONE PART Alternative Dance Studio</strong>: Want to just come and pick up a new skill or work on toning those muscles in a creative and exciting way without the pressure of being on stage? We got that too. But make sure you come out and cheer all your new friends when it’s showtime!</p>
<p><strong>ONE PART Theatre</strong>: We will now be able to host our own showcases, performances and cabaret shows! We will also be able to open our doors to others that are in need of a gorgeous theatre space and stage for their dream shows!</p>
<p><strong>ONE PART Dance Company</strong>: Flux Vertical Theatre will finally have it’s own stage and rehearsal space so that we can continue to bring you pole and dance shows with no limitations!</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Our WHY</h2>
<p>The most common question we consistently get asked from our show goers is “Where can I learn to do this?” or “Where can I take a Flux Vertical Theatre class?” And we have never been able to fully answer this question... until now! </p>
<p>With the art and sport of pole growing everyday and becoming more popular, having a safe space for all genres of the pole community to be together in is a huge deal. Pole is a place where so many people find their freedom of movement, body acceptance, inner beauty, strength, confidence and most of all life long friends. Pole can be athletic, artistic or sensual. Pole is for any age and ANY BODY and we want to share it with the world in our new space!</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Money</h2>
<p>We are looking to raise $50,000 to get us started. This will help cover the beginning stages of the build out. We will first need to add a fresh coat of paint while the trussing and poles are being installed. Then we start laying down our sprung wood floor so we can protect our dancers' joints and muscles. The stage is next! </p>
<p>Here is an estimated breakdown of those costs: <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627165317/gd86k7qdbpp46cx2vuiu.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Trussing - <strong><i>$18,700</i></strong>   Poles - <strong><i>$8,700</i></strong>   Floors - <strong><i>$17,100</i></strong>   Stage - <strong><i>$5,000</i></strong>   Paint - <i><strong>$500</strong></i></p>
<p>As you can see it will take much more to complete this project and to realize our ultimate vision but it will get the ball rolling. Building a studio is an intense labor of love and is not going to be cheap. If we raise money beyond our goal we will be able to get super tall mirrors for our walls, gorgeous velvet stage curtains, lighting and sound equipment for the stage and also add some amenities like a second bathroom for your tushy’s!</p>
<p>We are just two girls with big dreams and at the end of the day it’s just about making dreams come true!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Sophie Holmes (She/Her) and I am a performance artist working with body somatics, presence and space to create new artwork. As part of a Fellowship with the LEIMAY Ensemble, called the Incubator Program, I am working on a devised performance piece called FRAGMENT.  The LEIMAY Ensemble is a performance and dance collective based in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. This is a 2 night performance taking place in Brooklyn, NY on October 28th &amp; 29th 2021 at Cloud City in Williamsburg.  A solo performance that includes the presences of many, the piece is a play on “first thought best thought” and a collaboration with ensemble near and far.  Admission will be sliding scale $5-$20, no one will be turned away for lack of funds, follow link to purchase your ticket(s) here!</p>
<p> <a href=""https://withfriends.co/event/12666261/fragment"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://withfriends.co/event/12666261/fragment</a></p>
<p>A snippet from the piece…</p>
<p>The workerchef, the animal clay body, the newspaper femme doctor join in conversation to untangle the threads, the elements that create unison and a fourth happening.  Heat, water, clay, newspaper and rocks and the red light square. Come get fed!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am looking to raise $3,500 for this project.  Some of that money is going to me, the artist, the rest will be put toward paying for materials (clay, clothing, objects), transportation, videographer (Camera rental, editing), rehearsal fees, sound equipment, lighting, advertising and a project assistant/manager.</p>
<p>I’m hoping to raise a majority of the money though the ‘’selling’’ of some of my sculptures.  The rest I am asking for in generous donations, $1-$1000 please!  You may choose one of my sculptures to buy as a “perk,” partly because you like it :), and partly as a thank you for your generosity in supporting art makers. All the sculptures I have made in the last year are inspired by chance and space awareness.  Some of them have ways of standing or sitting and others may want to be hung, worn or even pinned (hot glue needed).  I will leave that up to you, so please let me know if I can include a piece of red thread, yellow thread (or both) or a brooch pin.  If you choose to make the piece a brooch I will be happy to provide the pin but ask that you do the gluing as a small part in making it your own.  Please note that while the sculptures may appear large, they are actually quite small.  1-3 inches for most of the metal ones and 4-10 inches for those that incorporate wood.  Small is beautiful. </p>
<p>I may be adding more perks as time goes on, so please keep a look out!</p>
<p>And another thing…Please come! That would mean the most to me!  Money helps the process though :).  I also plan on making photo prints from the performance to mail to everyone who donates after as an additional thank you.  If you chose a sculpted friend then I already have your address and if you didn’t then I’ll contact you to find a way to send you one.  Amazing, thank you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The most immediate impact will be in the sharing of this work with a collective witness and co-creator in space, aka you all. As an art person I always seek community, both intimate and collective, and performance brings people into community and can act as a living part of that community.  In a different sense, as a personal process, the real impact is unknown and ongoing.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Covid-19, health and safety pose a risk and challenge to art makers and in asking people to gather (45-50 viewers max) it is something that I am taking seriously.  While NYC is relatively well vaccinated and cases are stable, the delta variant and country wide low vaccinations rates still present an active health risk.  Proof of full vaccination will be mandatory, masks will also be required for entry. Social distancing will not be able to be maintained as it is an intimate space but with masks and vaccination we are doing the best we can to keep everyone safe.  If you feel sick, have tested positive for Covid within two weeks prior to the performance or have been exposed to Covid-19 we ask that stay home or in exposure cases, get a negative test result before coming. Please get vaccinated if you haven’t already so that you can come see art. Thank you!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand that asking for money is not a small thing and anyway people can contribute financially will be so meaningful to this process.  I also understand that it’s not easy or possible to always give in that way.  I can only ask that if giving money is not available to you but you want to contribute in some way to please share this event with anyone you think would be interested. Or, even better, if not able to donate please come to the performance!!  Again, no one will be turned away at the door for financial reasons, come see art. Thank you for your kindness, your generosity, thank you for your heart!</p>

However, what, or rather, who awaits may surprise you. How will your research play out? Will you find Thea?"" </p> <p>This is an uplifting interactive tale about the myriad of ways we experience grief, and the opportunities we have to help each other through it.

<h3>Our Process</h3>
<p>It is essential that this story arise from authenticity. The director and writer are working with the actors to craft characters and performances which capture the quirks (and often, contradictions) of real, lived experiences. To build on that authenticity, we're offering the chance for you to participate in a ""beta"" run - and early-access preview of the first act of the show - and share your reactions and ideas to help influence the continued development of Thea L'Anna. The live beta will run July 9 - 25, the final preview coinciding with the conclusion of this campaign. There will be an additional 6 weeks of development before Thea L'Anna goes live to the world. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our initial goal of $5500 covers the basics of the production: paying artist stipends, purchasing and shipping props and costumes, custom graphic arts and other digital media, design and implementation of the virtual world of the show on Gather.town, marketing, and printing.</p>
<p>We have tentative stretch goals of $8000 and $10,000 which will allow for increased artist stipends, pay for a Discord community manager, additional media for marketing, improvements to production assets, and cool programming magic to further enrich the immersive experience of the virtual world of Thea L'Anna. </p>
<p>It's our great pleasure to provide some exciting perks for your contribution to this goal: custom art created for the show by the incredible Genevieve Hartman, contributor-only early access and the opportunity to impact the story and it's content and be included in it, a stress relief activity book, an invitation to our Discord community where we'll be sharing sneak peaks and other exclusive content,  VIP ""founders"" care packages, eternal recognition as an early supporter of Thea L'Anna in our digital program...and of course, our sincere and enthusiastic thanks! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Now for the most important part: the difference you'll make by supporting this campaign! Thea L'Anna is as much about individual journeys as it is about the social nature of grief support. This is a community and we are connecting through compassion - you can help it to flourish and thrive by joining us! As we move forward in the wake of a devastating pandemic and ongoing climate change, it's more critical than ever that we make time and space for collective healing. </p>
<p>Not to mention a portion of your campaign contribution is tax deductible, helping Dragon Productions - a Bay Area non-profit - continue to make impactful art in their mission to serve as a theatrical hub that fosters an inclusive artistic community for the creation of experiences that are innovative, intimate, empathetic, accessible and bold.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Here's some great news: there's no risk involved. Thanks to seed funding from Dragon Productions and Magnetic Mapworks, Thea L'Anna has enough of a financial foundation to guarantee that this production gets off the ground. Your contribution helps us build on that momentum and soar. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Here's some more good news: you don't have to spend any money to help out if you're not able or ready to! Word of mouth is just as valuable of a contribution as any dollar amount. By sharing this campaign with your friends and family (direct messages make the biggest impact!) and on your favorite social media platform, this campaign can blossom into the flourishing community it's envisioned to be. </p>

<p>Since 2016, Las Vegas's <strong>Majestic Repertory Theatre</strong> has been home to a very diverse group of theatre artists: actors, writers, directors,  and designers. Our work - particularly in immersive and experiential productions - has been featured in national and global media, including <strong>The New York Times</strong>, <strong>USA Today</strong>, <strong>CNN</strong>, <strong>Good Morning America</strong>, and more.<br/><br/>However, like many arts organizations around the world, we were severely impacted by the COVID pandemic. <strong>Our doors closed in March 2020</strong>, and although we have been experimenting with distanced performances, <strong>we will not be able to return to full indoor productions until Fall 2021.</strong></p>
<p>To mark that very special occasion, we will be producing the American premiere of <strong>The Sandman </strong>- a new musical by the writers of the<strong> Tony-winning Broadway musical Bandstand, Richard Oberacker </strong>and<strong> Robert Taylor.</strong></p>

<h3>A Terrifying Tale...</h3>
<p>Drawn from the more nightmarish fantasy of E.T.A. Hoffmann, author of <strong>The Nutcracker</strong>, comes a new and darkly comic musical tale – <strong>THE SANDMAN</strong>. When the family of an ingenious German clockmaker engages a new nanny to care for the children, a series of bizarre and unnatural events begin to unfold. As the Strauss family is thrust ever deeper into chaos, the sinister forces at play are revealed – forces from which only the children may be able to save them.</p>

<h3>Why Your Support Matters</h3>
<p><font><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;"">Producing <strong>THE SANDMAN </strong>is an opportunity for our award-winning theatre company to make an impactful return to live production in our 99-seat storefront in the heart of the Las Vegas Arts District.</span></font></p>
<p><font><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;"">The writers selected Majestic Repertory Theater for their American premiere because of <strong>our reputation for tackling daring, new works</strong>. Originally slated for Fall 2020, we're excited to finally bring this Little Nightmare Musical to gleefully ghoulish light.</span></font></p>
<p><font><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;"">However, diving into any project of this size after a year-long shutdown is like cranking a Chevy that's been parked for months: <strong>we need a jumpstart.</strong></span></font></p>
<p><font><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;"">Unlike many non-profit organizations, charitable donations only make up a small amount of our operating budget. We rely primarily on single ticket sales - but having been closed for the past year, we haven't had those sales. <strong>So, this Indiegogo campaign is like you giving us those jumper cables.</strong></span></font></p>
<p>With the money raised from this campaign:</p>

</div></div>","A Chilling Reality...

Since 2016, Las Vegas's Majestic Repertory Theatre has been home to a very diverse group of theatre artists: actors, writers, directors,  and designers. Our work - particularly in immersive and experiential productions - has been featured in national and global media, including The New York Times, USA Today, CNN, Good Morning America, and more.However, like many arts organizations around the world, we were severely impacted by the COVID pandemic. Our doors closed in March 2020, and although we have been experimenting with distanced performances, we will not be able to return to full indoor productions until Fall 2021.
To mark that very special occasion, we will be producing the American premiere of The Sandman - a new musical by the writers of the Tony-winning Broadway musical Bandstand, Richard Oberacker and Robert Taylor.


 
A Terrifying Tale...
Drawn from the more nightmarish fantasy of E.T.A. Hoffmann, author of The Nutcracker, comes a new and darkly comic musical tale – THE SANDMAN. When the family of an ingenious German clockmaker engages a new nanny to care for the children, a series of bizarre and unnatural events begin to unfold. As the Strauss family is thrust ever deeper into chaos, the sinister forces at play are revealed – forces from which only the children may be able to save them.

Original artwork by Stephanie Delazeri
 

Why Your Support Matters
Producing THE SANDMAN is an opportunity for our award-winning theatre company to make an impactful return to live production in our 99-seat storefront in the heart of the Las Vegas Arts District.
The writers selected Majestic Repertory Theater for their American premiere because of our reputation for tackling daring, new works. Originally slated for Fall 2020, we're excited to finally bring this Little Nightmare Musical to gleefully ghoulish light.
However, diving into any project of this size after a year-long shutdown is like cranking a Chevy that's been parked for months: we need a jumpstart.
Unlike many non-profit organizations, charitable donations only make up a small amount of our operating budget. We rely primarily on single ticket sales - but having been closed for the past year, we haven't had those sales. So, this Indiegogo campaign is like you giving us those jumper cables.
With the money raised from this campaign:

We will be able to hire the finest theatrical designers to bring this nightmare vision to life.
We will be able to hire an amazing cast, all of whom have been out of work for the past year.
We will be able to pay royalties to the writers of this thrilling work.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>to the Virtual Stage!</strong></h2>
<p>During the pandemic, we’ve found a greater need for art that helps us see the reality of life—in an entertaining way that can be easily digested.  That’s our aim with the play <strong><i>Nickel and Dimed</i></strong>.</p>
<p>We are the newly formed ARRT Productions Collective, a group of five long-time theater and entertainment professionals excited and moved to bring to life our first virtual production on July 24th and 25th.  No surprise.  Everyone was affected by the pandemic last year.  Just about everyone’s job was affected.  Or maybe you were one of the millions who lost your job or business.</p>
<p>San Francisco-based playwright Joan Holden adapted Nickel and Dimed from Barbara Ehrenreich’s 2001 bestselling book of the same name. Ehrenreich went undercover to report on what it’s like to live on minimum wage. Her story drives home how difficult it can be depending on your race, age, gender, and education, among other factors, to make ends meet.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>In our effort to put on this play, we feel our purpose and calling is to give back to our community beyond our production.  We’ll give a portion of all donations to a nonprofit that supports increasing the minimum wage as well as to tickets for those who are unable to afford them.  We want to help change our current, painful economic reality from one of suffering to one of thriving.</p>
<p>We ask you, our community, to help us raise $3000 to support our production.  The more we raise, the more we’ll be able to help our cause.</p>

<p>This has been an especially difficult year for our young people given the recent pandemic. Missed school events, sports, proms, and other activities that make growing up an enriching experience have practically been on hold for the last year. So challenging, I hear many heart-breaking stories from the young people we work with every day.

We are elated to <strong>finally </strong>be able to safely bring this play to the stage, and provide opportunities for many young artists who have been unable to work in live theatre for over a year. </p>
<p>Like so many emerging artists in our industry - our lives and careers were put on pause during the pandemic. We have missed the joys of being in an artistic community with one another in a shared space. We cannot wait to get back to the breathless first-day of school excitement of the first rehearsal, the deep camaraderie of the late nights of tech, and the singular elation of the moment the crowd starts to hush as the show begins on opening night - but we need your help to get there. </p>
<p>We're already well on our way - with a successful fundraiser as a part of the Tank's June Pridefest lineup where we were able to share a sneak preview of the show!  </p>

The Great Hunger takes us on an anachronistic, genre-bending journey through the past and into the present, exploring the different ways we define pain, suffering, and connection.
THE GREAT HUNGER by Kallan Dana. Coming to New York September 2021. 

Help us bring the latest in a series of joyous collaborations between playwright/director duo Kallan Dana and Erica Zippel Schnitzer to in-person audiences this fall.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>Welcome, Home</i> is an original one-act play written and directed by Parker Forest Olson. <i>Welcome, Home</i> explores a family over the course of a decade as they begin, fall apart, and reassemble, all while the spirit of Home enters and exits their lives, acting as a grandmotherly figure driving and nourishing their growth.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are proud to announce that this show will be curated by the 2021 Elgin Fringe Festival. This is a community event that produces <strong>minimalist</strong> performances, so what we're looking to raise is very small to cover the price of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Elgin Fringe Festival production fee</li>
<li>A small, compactable dining room set</li>
<li>The necessary lumber to build eight wooden theater boxes</li>
<li>A handful of small props</li>
<li>Any costume pieces that the actors don't already have</li>
<li>Press material (posters and postcards)</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why This Project Matters to Us</h3>
<p><i>Welcome Home</i> is about the family as a unit, observing the symbols that carry special meaning for many families, whether it's the mismatched linens in the closet or the floral-design plates in the cupboard. Beyond that, this piece ventures to ensure audiences that families are adaptable and have the ability to rebuild and come together through anything life can throw our way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you don't have the means to help financially, we would highly appreciate a share on any social media source. Getting the campaign publicized is the easiest way for us to reach our goal.</p>

<h3>A Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Off West End theatre scene is the proving ground of the UK's theatrical talent and in 2020 the ravages of the Covid-19 pandemic led to the decision to close the theatre indefinitely. However, in the spring of 2021 the management of The Bridge House pub and Luke Adamson agreed to work to reopen the theatre as a producing house as well as a home for visiting companies.</p>
<p>This is obviously a huge undertaking that will involve a lot of practical adjustments. From buying lights and chairs to being able to support the artistic community with an affordable space to work and be a part of.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So here's some of things we're going to be spending the initial investment on</p>
<ul>
<li>A professional website. A well presented digital face of the venue that represents the quality of the work we're doing.</li>
<li>A sound and lighting rig. A proper theatre needs proper equipment, this will involve mounting weight bearing bars that can support a range of lights and speakers for the space. This could also involve running new electrical wires and cables.</li>
<li>Chairs! Quite simply, the audience need somewhere to sit!</li>
</ul>
<p>In return for your donations you will be offered: </p>
<ul>
<li>Thanks</li>
<li>Discounted or complimentary tickets to a range of shows and opportunities to meet the creative team.</li>
<li>Access to exclusive events as part of our launch season that will feature a range of shows from all different aspects of the industry. Traditional theatre, comedy, cabaret, poetry &amp; spoken word, family shows, dance and more!</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In 2019 arts and culture contributed £10.47 billion to the UK economy, with an estimated 226,000 jobs in the arts industry in 2019. Now more than ever, with the combined pressure of budget cuts and an industry closed due to the pandemic, small companies like ourselves need all the support we can get to help keep the arts alive and local communities engaged with the cultural and economical significance of its work. </p>
<p>As a small scale fringe venue we hope to be able to actively engage with the local area whilst also being a welcoming home to companies from further afield that want to bring their work to us.</p>
<p>Every penny you're able to contribute will help to bring this idea to life!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Obviously the arts and entertainment industries are volatile ones, and like with any new business there will be risks. There may be unforeseen technical difficulties, there might be another global pandemic or the audience might just not be interested!</p>
<p>However, as a team; Artistic Director, Luke Adamson and Associate Director, Joseph Lindoe, have worked together for many years and have a combined experience spanning multiple decades in the industry. The success of their previous shows as JLA Productions shows their commitment to a sustainable business model. We know when we're biting off more than we can chew and how to grow a programme bit by bit, ensuring there is always the time and resources available to give whatever the current project is as much attention as it deserves.</p>
<p>We know what it's like to produce theatre and visit a venue as well, one of our aims is to offer a space that is as risk free as possible to incoming companies, with smaller guarantees on box office splits and lower hire fees, as well as a holistic approach to the marketing and creative support. The last thing you want is someone who just takes your money and says ""here's your space"".</p>

<h3>Our Work</h3>
<p>Arm-of-the-Sea Theater is a high-quality, creative, community-based mask and puppet theater group that tours throughout the Hudson Valley, New York State, and beyond. We are integrating our award-winning artistic and environmental advocacy achievements to bring the Tidewater Center to our Hudson River Valley community. This new venue will serve a dual-purpose as a cultural gathering space and the future home for our organization.</p>
<p>Our mission is to deliver wonder, joy, and insight to inspire the next generation of environmental stewards. We believe that having fun, caring about social issues, and making good art is vitally important to the community.  Our touring company, with five performers and a one-man-band, typically presents 50 to 75 performances each year, reaching over 15,000 guests. We also conduct theater residency programs at schools and camps.</p>
<p>We’ve been touring since 1982 and are ready to settle down! We found a fantastic spot on Esopus Creek in Saugerties, about 100 miles north of New York City, but there’s a catch. It’s on the site of the 19th century Sheffield paper mill, so we have A LOT to clean up. There are ruins and sluiceways, a deteriorated bulkhead, and some coal ash contamination.  We aren’t just building a new center to celebrate art, science and history- we are also cleaning up a brownfield and revitalizing the shoreline!</p>
<p>Eventually, the Tidewater Center will have a theater/events building lined by 350 feet of new public waterfront. There will be an environmental science center, art studio, waterworks playground, and a space to offer programming for children and seniors. We’ll also be booking other magnificent performers!</p>
<p>            Every long journey starts with a few steps. This spring, we will clean up the site, build a parking lot, and construct an outdoor performance space. This will let us open for summer to offer live entertainment from Arm-of-the-Sea Theater and other performers. Imagine sitting on a hillside on a summer night and watching a live show with the creek sparkling in the background!</p>
<p>Arm-of-the-Sea Theater brings people together. We have an amazing opportunity to move into our new space, the Tidewater Center, and transform it into a hub of creativity to share with residents and visitors alike. We can’t do it without your support.</p>
<p>Help us make Arm-of-the-Sea’s vision a reality. When you contribute to our efforts, you will receive exclusive donation rewards!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Here's how the new Arm-of-the-Sea Tidewater Center will make an impact:</p>
<ul>
<li>.For 38 years we have toured our shows, fostering a sense of curiosity and connection throughout the Hudson Valley and beyond.  With a space of our own, we look forward to investing in the people and telling the stories of our local community.</li>
<li>With 350 feet of new public waterfront, the Tidewater Center will provide access to fishing, strolling and general enjoyment on the shore of Esopus Creek.  Not to mention the Covid-safe outdoor performance space overlooking the creek!</li>
<li>Our programs will offer opportunities for people of all ages to participate! From Arts &amp; Science camps to the theater internship program and resident company to giant puppet pageants, there will be many possibilities to get out, have fun and be creative. </li>
<li>We will collaborate with other local arts organizations, such as Shout Out Saugerties, to bring even more live theater and other events to the Tidewater Center.</li>
<li>The arts are important! If you don't believe us go talk to teachers, social workers, parents, and more.  They know that having a creative passion can make or break the lives of kids and adults alike. Saugerties and the Hudson Valley will benefit tremendously from having this outlet.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Someone once said, ""It's always impossible until it's done.""  We have come a long way - and now have an approved Master Plan, construction drawings, 75 feet of reconstructed bulkhead- but it’s important that we finish the sitework so we can open the Tidewater Center this summer.</p>
<ul>
<li>Risk 1: Not raising enough money. The good news is that we are halfway there. We are addressing this risk by turning over every stone to search for funds.  We are presenting our plans to many different people, businesses and foundations, so that when we get close to reaching our funding goal, we can ask again for a little bit more of their support.</li>
<li>Risk 2: Covid-19 delays. The good news is that this will be an outdoor performance space. The audience will be safely distanced, and our puppeteers will perform safely. (It is MASKED theater, after all!)</li>

</div></div>","Our Work
Arm-of-the-Sea Theater is a high-quality, creative, community-based mask and puppet theater group that tours throughout the Hudson Valley, New York State, and beyond. We are integrating our award-winning artistic and environmental advocacy achievements to bring the Tidewater Center to our Hudson River Valley community. This new venue will serve a dual-purpose as a cultural gathering space and the future home for our organization.
Our mission is to deliver wonder, joy, and insight to inspire the next generation of environmental stewards. We believe that having fun, caring about social issues, and making good art is vitally important to the community.  Our touring company, with five performers and a one-man-band, typically presents 50 to 75 performances each year, reaching over 15,000 guests. We also conduct theater residency programs at schools and camps.
We’ve been touring since 1982 and are ready to settle down! We found a fantastic spot on Esopus Creek in Saugerties, about 100 miles north of New York City, but there’s a catch. It’s on the site of the 19th century Sheffield paper mill, so we have A LOT to clean up. There are ruins and sluiceways, a deteriorated bulkhead, and some coal ash contamination.  We aren’t just building a new center to celebrate art, science and history- we are also cleaning up a brownfield and revitalizing the shoreline!
Eventually, the Tidewater Center will have a theater/events building lined by 350 feet of new public waterfront. There will be an environmental science center, art studio, waterworks playground, and a space to offer programming for children and seniors. We’ll also be booking other magnificent performers!
            Every long journey starts with a few steps. This spring, we will clean up the site, build a parking lot, and construct an outdoor performance space. This will let us open for summer to offer live entertainment from Arm-of-the-Sea Theater and other performers. Imagine sitting on a hillside on a summer night and watching a live show with the creek sparkling in the background!
Arm-of-the-Sea Theater brings people together. We have an amazing opportunity to move into our new space, the Tidewater Center, and transform it into a hub of creativity to share with residents and visitors alike. We can’t do it without your support.
Help us make Arm-of-the-Sea’s vision a reality. When you contribute to our efforts, you will receive exclusive donation rewards!

What We Need & What You Get

We are fundraising for $50,000.  The entire cost to clean up and open this summer is $100,000.  We have already raised half of this - you can help us with the rest!

<li>We put on an early workshop of it in Chicago</li>

<p>Deepak and I started making music together in high school. I'm not going to say there was an instant spark because there wasn't but there was potential there, and a whole lot of trust in each other. In college we kept making music, (directing competing acapella groups, which both placed at ICCAs at a national level). After college, I was a little directionless at my new-grad job and one day Deepak messaged me to ask if I wanted to write a musical with him. Fast-forward two years to May of 2019, when we found ourselves putting on an early workshop of Baked! The Musical in Chicago, selling out the whole theatre, setting up more folding chairs, and then selling out those seats as well!</p>
<p>The week after that workshop, the show was invited by a panel of judges to appear at Chicago Musical Theatre Festival in February 2020. Since then, we've been rewriting character arcs, crafting new songs, and preparing for the onslaught of work that goes into putting on a musical.</p>

<p>Other high school coming of age musicals (e.g. Be More Chill, Dear Evan Hansen, Heathers) never felt quite honest to us.

<h3>Who Am I?</h3>
<p>Hey guys, I'm Sammy. First off BIG thank you for considering donating to this project. I hold it close to my heart. For those of you who don't know I've overcome various ailments- including symptoms of a cancer diagnosis- through alternative forms of medicine. Those forms included: </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">pole dance</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">meditation </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">acupuncture </p>
<p>When Western medicine could no longer help me, all three of these practices (to my surprise at the time) healed my mind and, in turn, my body. I want to bring these practices - and the opportunity to self-heal-  to communities that are not currently being served in Brooklyn. That is why this studio space is such a special project for me. Your contribution will help make this happen.</p>

A fierce social critic and the first woman awarded the Pulitzer Prize (The Age of Innocence, 1920) Edith Wharton's chilling short stories are the beating heart of this devised play probing the confinement of social norms and the price the living pay for ignoring the past.
After a two-year hiatus, I returned to the rehearsal studio at the end of summer along with an incredible ensemble of actors and designers. Together, we are having a wonderful time using devising techniques to make this original performance. I'm excited to share the work we are creating, and I hope you will join us at Triskelion Arts this October! 
Performances are:
Friday, October 22, 7:30 PMSaturday, October 23, 2:00 PM*Saturday, October 23, 7:30 PMSunday, October 24, 2:00 PM
Tickets can be purchased directly at Eventbrite.

<p>Radial Theater Project will present Locally Grown, a festival of original work by local performing artists at New City Theater, January 30-February 28, 2015.
</p>
<h3>Why We're Creating the Festival</h3>
<p>Radial Theater Project's mission is to support the creation of original work by local theater artists. Seattle is home to many adventurous performing artists who tour their work nationally and internationally. Locally Grown will bring many of them together under a single roof, where local audiences can see their favorites and be introduced to new artists in an intimate setting.</p>
<p>We're showing off some of Seattle's best performers. Many of them work mostly out of town, on the fringe festival circuit or through presenters in other cities. At this festival, Seattle audiences have a chance to see the work here, before it hits the road. And all of the tickets are affordable.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The festival's business model is artist-friendly. Artists pay a fixed amount to cover space rent, and receive 100% of the rest of their box office receipts. We need your financial support to cover staffing and marketing costs.</p>
<p>We'll honor you with an acknowledgment in the theater lobby,  and depending on your donation level, you can receive perks ranging from festival souvenirs to tickets to see the shows.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Locally Grown is unique in its approach: We've identified and invited theater artists with a proven track record, and we've said: ""Create Something"".  All of these artists regularly create inspiring, entertaining shows, and they know how to produce and market the work with the support of a presenting organization (such as a fringe festival). But presenting the work on their own, in their own home town, is expensive and financially risky, and so they only do it infrequently. Locally Grown offers artists that essential support. And Seattle audiences get to see the work first, before it starts to travel the world. We think it's a great deal for everyone.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Radial Theater Project has a lot of experience in creating new work, having commissioned and produced 5 world premieres by local playwrights since the company's inception. This festival is the next step in our evolution. We need your support to ensure that the festival breaks even and we can present it again in the future.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We need your help in getting the word out, about the festival and about this fundraising campaign. Share these links with your friends!</p>

In digital era, privacy must be a priority. Is it just me, or is secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous? Al Gore
A dramatic investigation of surveillance in a suspiciously normal, yet surreal society where the citizens have given up all rights to privacy. They are ultimately safe-but safe from what? The police seem superflous, while the ominous Seeing-Men have complete control. A world that Kafka would recognize with a shudder.
Where an innocent group of kids discover a dangerous game, an idealistic young man turns into a scrupulous bully, and a fun loving grandma becomes the major suspect in an impossible crime.
In a world, not so different from ours, this is a place where the people are protected at all costs. Their crime rate is next to nothing, murders and thefts are something of the past. But so is privacy. The lack of privacy is the only reason that they are all so safe. So where does one draw the line? How does one decide to accept the ultimate surveillance that the government offers and forsake the basic right to privacy? When should a secret not be kept and the truth exposed? A diverse group of teenagers from all over the world ages 13-19, have created a play that explores exactly these questions.

<p>While Michael is indeed magical, he isn't Jesus or… Chris Angel, so he needs a plane ticket to cross the
ocean. Seriously, Michael is
taking on 2 categories, both close up magic and stage, and hopes to bring at
least 2 assistants, so a week in Rimini, Italy plus travel expenses, registration, not to
mention the cost of glitter, will come to over $10,000!  </p>Since the stakes are higher, we also have put together a team to help get the word out there, who are donating and/or severely cut their prices for their time and talents, all in an effort to do their part to  not only get Mike to F.I.S.M. but to increase public awareness of such a unique and prestigious event.</div>

</div></div>","The Story:Michael
Dardant is a New Orleans Comedy Magician who's refined skill of sleight of hand has won him some of the most prestigious awards in Magic. He has now qualified to compete in what is considered to be the ""Olympics of Magic"" and can use your help to get there!







Michael tells people that he got his magic powers when he was 5 because of an incident in which he was bitten by a wizard!  But truthfully his talent stems from social anxiety and attention deficit disorder. Somehow this comedic cajun conjurer has brought his zany southern flair to the highest level of competition, becoming the most decorated magician in the country with over 20 first place National and International titles in Magic! This has brought him to the ultimate goal: F.I.S.M.!



FISM is
the World Championship of Magic. It occurs every 3
years in a different country. Michael is one of only ten Americans
selected to compete in this prestigious triennial event! With your help Michael can defend the USA's international magic reputation. According to Jon Stewart, this is becoming a serious issue!  Here is a link to the hilarious news segment called Lose Your Illusion!







The Impact:

What impacts people the most about magic is the way that magicians help people to believe in the impossible! An attempt at the World Championships of anything is generally considered to be an impossible dream.   Michael never believed he'd take it this far.  Why not believe it can go even farther?


Winning, even just performing at the level of FISM, will have a huge impact on Michael's career, literally multiplying his fan base and internet presence over night. But more importantly, it's one of those impossible dreams you only fantasize about as a kid. You can have an impact on a dream becoming reality and if you believe in his performance ability, help to have an impact on who gets to experience the magic!


The Need:
While Michael is indeed magical, he isn't Jesus or… Chris Angel, so he needs a plane ticket to cross the
ocean. Seriously, Michael is
taking on 2 categories, both close up magic and stage, and hopes to bring at
least 2 assistants, so a week in Rimini, Italy plus travel expenses, registration, not to
mention the cost of glitter, will come to over $10,000!  Since the stakes are higher, we also have put together a team to help get the word out there, who are donating and/or severely cut their prices for their time and talents, all in an effort to do their part to  not only get Mike to F.I.S.M. but to increase public awareness of such a unique and prestigious event.



The Word:
Get the word out.  Post it, send it, talk it up!  Forward this to everyone and anyone who may be interested in this plight or would support the art of magic! Keep it circulating and keep checking back for updates.  Thank you all in advance for all of your help and support.  Please feel free to contact Michael with any questions or encouraging words! 
Here is a suggested post you can copy and paste:
How often do you know someone competing in the world championships of... well anything, let alone something as unique as magic! My friend, Michael Dardant has done just that! Since 2012 he has captured more than 20 first place titles which has led to the ultimate goal of the ""Olympics of Magic"" known as F.I.S.M. He could use your support.  Visit his campaign page and get the word out!

""Derby Day"" is a captivating  play and when people experience it they are moved to care about it, to want to see it go further.  As a company who came together in support of this play it's our mission to see that it reaches the greatest audience possible.  It's a timeless story, one that is strangely unique yet familiar.The StoryThe play opens in the luxury box of Arkansas' Oaklawn Racetrack where the estranged Ballard brother's have reunited after the burial of their father.  Growing up, the racetrack was the one place that the brothers could escape their violent, chaotic childhood, the one place their father was the head of their family and not the source of their abuse.  Becky, a single mother and their waitress, bears witness to their old wounds and becomes drawn in to their new hopes which culminate with the final race of the day, a long shot to realize their dreams.The Edinburg Fringe FestivalWe can't get enough of this play.  It's funny and raucous while at the same time dark and visceral with a breakneck pace.   A common audience response has been, ""I didn't know theatre could be like this!"", which is the greatest kind of experience to share.  Whether you who are reading this have seen ""Derby Day"" or not, we hope that you are interested in joining us in our mission to share this play with the world.  There is no better way to give ""Derby Day"" that chance than by bringing it to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, the largest arts festival in the world with almost fifty thousand performers and over A MILLION audience members throughout the month of August.  We have already been accepted into the lineup of The Gilded Balloon, one of the four main venues of the festival, which is known for producing kinetic, challenging theatre, making it the perfect home for ""Derby Day"".A Call to ActionEvery play, every film that you have ever seen was made possible by the care and attention of individuals who championed and believed in them.  Every theatre company, no matter how small or large depends on it's family of supporters.   We have budgeted this production at close to $30k and have put our stated goal at $20k in order to avoid the 5% penalty that we incur should we not hit that higher amount.  We are so grateful and appreciative that you share our passion and will join us in championing ""Derby Day"".

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Summary</span><br/>
</h3> <p>My name is Alfie Noakes and I have been running open mic comedy shows for 5 years and doing so professionally since 2013 as the head honcho with We Are Funny Project.</p>
<p>Having worked in the media for over 10 years; a reporter on BBC Radio One, Documentary Producer/Director for MTV and with many credits on programmes aired on ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5... somehow I found myself running comedy nights as a hobby. </p>
<p>Right now The Project offers more stage time to open mike comedians than anyone else in the UK. Around 350 ""spots"" provided every month, 6 shows per week at 2 venues. </p>
<p>Professional comedians regularly headline our free shows and work out their new material alongside proven hits. This is a practice which almost every top comedian needs to do before the big tour or the TV appearance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Two years ago I set 3 initial targets for the We Are Funny Project.</p>
<p>The first was to massively increase the amount of stage time available to the open mic comedy community. Nothing is more helpful to a developing comedian than stage time. If they are prepared to make the effort then we are ready to provide the stage.</p>
<p>Target number 2 was to attract the largest numbers of real audience for our shows. We have a fine and enthusiastic audience at most shows and we can offer them even more.</p>
<p>With stages 1 and 2 completed this campaign is all about getting us to Stage 3. That is, to create a permanent venue and be able to offer the acts ""pays days"" as well as ""play days"".</p>
<p>Sadly, we have just been informed we are to lose our spiritual home for the last 5 years. We remain on excellent terms with the management it was a decision beyond all our control. So while one door closes we wish to kick another door in......hence this Campaign.</p>
<p>You can listen to a full interview with Alfie Noakes on the history of the We Are Funny Project and the ambitions for the Campaign here:</p>
<p><a href=""http://simoncaine.co.uk/ATI/AlfieNoakes"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://simoncaine.co.uk/ATI/AlfieNoakes</a><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>We wish to open a brand new comedy club on the London landscape and to make it so much more than that. To have total 24/7 access to a stage/room and fill it with comedy and more, drawing in our regular punters and a whole new audience. </p>
<p>We wish to build and nourish and help the comedy/live performance scene to flourish.</p>
<p>Our USP is to provide the complete Progression platform over time. For example, an audience member at an open mic night might decide that they want to ""give it a go"" and then they come and do just that. They work hard across the circuit and we offer them a longer 10 minute spot when ready. They continue to work hard on our stage and on others, maybe getting a headline 20 minute set on an open night. This is ultimately driving towards a paid middle spot on a weekend and then lining up towards headlining a weekend show for a paying and comedy savvy crowd.</p>
<p>Naturally we'll be paying for the established professional acts to come and rock the room at the weekends and various other occasions.</p>
<p>We hope to create a venue holding around 150 seats with a separate bar/coffee area that will be a ""hang-out"" for not just the audience before and after the shows, but for creative and funny people, as well as the general public, in the day times.</p>
<p>Should we be fortunate enough to reach our stretch goal then we would hope to have a second, smaller room. This would be used for more niche intimate shows, classes, training and workshops. Fundamentally this would allow us to dramatically expand the range of options we can offer by virtue of a wonderful economy of scale.</p>
<p>The space would be used to host comedy Workshops and Courses; writing, performing, MCing, etc. We have run many of these already. We would expand the range of Workshops available by entering new territory with such classes as ""How to Record and Stream a Podcast"", and so much more. Artists and Producers would be invited to come and suggest what they would like to use our space for...and thus keep The Project at the cutting edge,  productive and self-funding.</p>
<p>We wish to create a space where we are set up for podcast recording and streaming. We hope to be fully wired for sound and vision in order to deliver comedy content across any platform.</p>
<p>I have brought some TV show production value to the open mic comedy scene. One way in which we have achieved this is by creating/producing a number of comedy ""Formats"" <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">which forces the stand-ups to generate new material and deliver the freshest comedy shows in town. Our numerous formats include:</span></p>
<p>Challenge-  Requires hand-picked comics to produce 5 new minutes of stand-up to a given theme which they receive only <i>after</i> agreeing to perform, along the lines of “Virginity” or “Best Job Ever”.</p>
<p>Hecklers - Is the only comedy show in town where the audience are actively encouraged to abuse the acts and the acts fight back.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Swapsies - Is the show where 2 very different comedians are teamed up and challenged to write 5 brand new minutes of material for their partner, who MUST perform it. No matter what. What would you do if you could push </span><i style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">any</i><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> words into another persons mouth and make them regurgitate them.....?</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p>Tales - A themed Storytelling night</p>
<p>Variety - A family friendly old school Variety show with twists, always themed and bizarre, musical comedy, improv, stand-up and a range of weirdness.</p>
<p>Sexes - Cross-dressing character Comedy at its’ finest.</p>
<p>Types - Lampooning Types of the “Arche” and “Stereo” forms.</p>
<p>Pitches - As though addressing a Hollywood mogul, here’s the idea for a crazy movie, from a stand-up comedian.</p>
<p>Wisdom - The comedian has 5 minutes to address the 5 year old version of themselves and can give them some life advice.</p>
<p>Bedtime - A wildly inappropriate bedtime story for the audience, not a child who is all tucked-up.</p>
<p>Stars - Review of the film career of a major star, one film at a time, to create a witty arc and retrospective.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Project has the largest dedicated comedy meetup.com group in the country with around 1100 members who represent real audience/supporters and is growing all the time.</p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We are fortunate to have the admiration and support of established, talented and famous comedians who have been generous in letting it be known that they support what we are trying to achieve. Some have already recorded endorsements for us and we understand that more will weigh-in as the Campaign develops into July 2015.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The open mic comedy community is extraordinarily diverse and we are fortunate to have many volunteers to assist us with matters ranging from PR to photography, business advice to installing sound systems...there is a lot of community support built in to the operation, with services offered to us for free or at a considerable discount. We can get great ""bang for our buck"" thanks to the help of these good people.</span></p>
<p>Since the claim to be ""Funny"" is in our very title, this Campaign is designed to entertain and amuse and as such we have hatched a ""mascot"" in the form of Cheeky Martini. Our mascot will be undertaking some silly, even dangerous, missions over the Campaign period.</p>
<p>However, his is an emerging character and as time goes on, new layers to his weirdness, wit, wisdom and boldness will be revealed. Cheeky Martini has every likelihood to go viral, trend on Twitter and catch the interest of not just the supportive comics and comedy fans but the mainstream press as well.</p>
<p>Cheeky Martini will become especially visible each time that a funding milestone is reached, keeping the Campaign fresh and entertaining throughout. Fellow artists are lining up behind us to help Cheeky Martini do, and be, all that he can be. </p>
<p>At the end of the day it's about creating opportunities and bringing great laughs.</p> </div> <div> <h3>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">What We Need </span><br/>
</h3>
<div>We are hoping to raise £90, 000. Where possible we would source from other members of the community. If a comedian is also an electrician for his day job we'd look to hire that person first, assuming that they are properly qualified and reasonably priced.</div>
<div>Funds will be used to secure a venue, with the lions' share going on advance rent and deposit. London is not a cheap City.</div>
<div>However, by the day we open for business we shall need to have:</div>
<div>* Advertising, printed publicity materials and to have re-vamped the website</div>
<div>* Acquired food, alcohol and entertainments licenses from the local authority</div>
<div>* Fitted a stage with quality lighting arrangement</div>
<div>* Furnished the performance space with around 150 linked chairs and a number of tables for drinks and food</div>
<div>* Installed a computer network for general work, editing, uploading and keeping on top of social media, marketing and VT production</div>
<div>* Additional microphones and cameras so that performances, podcasts, lectures and more can be recorded/streamed at a very high standard</div>
<div>* Re-modeled and decorated the venue/room to make it ideal for the purpose of hosting live performances and gatherings</div>
<div>* Furnished and decorated the bar/cafe area with comfortable seating and space for the customers (though we would wish for the space to be used by local artists to display their work for sale and create a flow of changing decor while working with our community)</div>
<div>* Installed and stocked a kitchen, with food display and serving area</div>
<div>* Fixed both exterior and interior signage and on-site advertising for our own events<br/>
</div>
<div>* Installed and stocked the bar in a fashion that we can serve many people simultaneously, as we will surely have clear ""rush"" periods for refreshments</div>
<div>* Cash registers, electronic point of sale equipment, phones, internet, etc</div>
<div>* Deposits for key utilities; gas, electricity and water</div>
<div>* Our basic office furniture which is needed to work, desk and chairs, folders, shelving, etc</div>
<div>* Paid public insurance premiums</div>
<div>* Security systems; alarms, CCTV, hard drive recorder</div>
<div>* Paid professional fees such as legal costs and accountancy</div>
<div>* Obtained necessary items such as tools, ladders, cleaning equipment, etc</div>
<div>* Addressed additional elements such as soundproofing, coat check, box office, etc</div>
<div>* Last but not least, some of the our Perks are amazing but will cost some money to deliver upon and this has to be taken into account. Examples, teachers would still need to be paid to run Workshops. There will be a clear cost in putting on the super-charged opening weekend shows for which we hope to advance sell the tickets to our supporters here.</div>
<div>
<h3>What You Get</h3>The We Are Funny Project is not asking for something for nothing. We believe that our major appeal is ""the big picture"" of creating a hub that is committed to comedy in particular and the arts in general. </div>
<div>The world will be a better place with a one-stop-shop for comedy and comedians of all levels in addition to the learning and production opportunities we will offer. Besides, a welcoming cafe and bar sitting within such a special place will have its' own appeal.</div>
<div>However, we have some special treats for our supporters, be they performers or patrons!</div>
<div>A small donation means that you will get a special video message from Cheeky Martini himself, a larger donation means (if you are London local) the man himself will come and do some poor quality cleaning of your house for an extremely limited time period. he will entertain you in the process of course, live and in the flesh.</div>
<div>There are comedy CDs, DVDs and books as produced by our friends, autographed as you request.</div>
<div>We are offering places on the variety of Workshops we'll be holding in the coming months, some will happen even before we open up the venue itself. Tickets for future shows will be available to donors, or if you are feeling extra generous you could have a pair of tickets for life, for any show we ever stage, the ""Golden"" tickets.</div>
<div>Maybe you'd like to have the full run of the club for a day and a night and have our complete support in you running your own event, no matter what it is?</div>
<div>We'll be changing the Perks on a regular basis, offering different incentives to get involved. Some will be small but worthy, others might have a high value and will be offered at an appropriate rate.</div>
<div>We hope that some of our supporters will offer up goods and services for us to make available to future donors and keep the Campaign running, ever fresh and rewarding.</div>
<div><h3>If We Do Not Reach Our Target....</h3></div>
<div>Then we shall have to re-consider the plan and strategy in view of the finance we have been able to raise. Perhaps we could still achieve the goal but with a smaller room, or compromising on locating to the precise Central London area that we have in mind.</div>
<div>The funds that are raised would most certainly be used to further the mission to open a new, complete progression, comedy venue. However, the ambition and scale would clearly need to be scaled down. It may be a case of seeking private investment to supplement the Crowdfunded money.</div>
<div>
<h3>If We Exceed Our Target....</h3>
<div>Then we will be very happy bunnies indeed and would look to have a second, smaller, room available in the club. This would mean we would be more free to run rehearsals, weekly courses and the like, keeping the main room entirely free for bigger events and larger crowds. </div>
<div>This would create an economy of scale so that we could offer much more, for only a little extra investment and space. We would stagger shows and classes so that there would be a steady flow through the bar and cafe rather than huge crowds and queues for short periods, then relative quiet, allowing for better service and improved business practice.</div>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>Our new venue is designed to offer the most for the newest acts on the scene. Good stage, good crowds, good company...opportunities to come and watch the best; be taught by the funniest and most talented. Our mission is to generate more and more quality laughter in the world and we know just the people who want to do that....comedians. And those who love them.</div>
<div>Five years ago it was two shows a month in the basement of a pub. In May 2015 we ran 27 different shows, including 4 Edinburgh Previews with major comedy names, plus a Workshop on ""How To MC A Comedy Show"".</div>
<div>Even with around 350 ""spots"" each month we are still over-subscribed and The Project is well-regarded by almost everyone who performs with us. </div>
<div>In a world where we are looking at the screen so very often it's a fine thing to see some vital performances, laugh so hard that your bum wiggles and keep live comedy strong and healthy. We have been with the grass roots for a while and some of our friends are truly emerging talents....we have the knowledge, the contacts, the audience, the vision and ambition. It's the venue that is the issue.</div>
<div>The Project is keen to bring stand-up comedy to young people whether by taking Workshops into schools or opening our doors to youth groups during the days in school holidays we feel we can offer a wonderfully fun interest for the very newest generation of potential comedians and performers. </div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>The single biggest issue is the ""chicken and egg"" matter of the Venue. We need to have funds in place so we can move like lightning when we locate the ideal, available home for the project.</div>
<div>We recently identified a near-perfect venue in all regards; size, set-up, location, history and reputation as a live events setting. The rent was very expensive. However little would have needed to be done with regard to re-modelling so one saving would have off-set the other cost. </div>
<div>This venue was taken up by a third party extremely quickly. We are able to use the numbers and stats as a fair comparative for what we would be looking for and would need to pay.</div>
<div>The fact is that we will need to have the funds in place so we can secure the right venue, when we find it, fast and efficiently. </div>
<div>It is simply not practical to find the venue, ask them to wait 2 - 3 months while we set up and run a campaign, and hope we raise the funds. It really has to be the case of Crowdfund now and be ready to pounce when the time is right.</div>
<div>We believe that it will be a tough ask to fund a Central London venue only by ticketed events. Our business model requires we have various revenue streams and not reliant on any single one. Bar and food sales will be significant. Workshops and courses, renting out the space for photo-shoots, lectures, rehearsals etc will also be vital.</div>
<div>We will have a wonderful space, fully kitted and easy on the eye. It should be used as much as possible by a diverse range of people, all paying in (one way or another) to keep the business viable. We will then have the luxury of supplementing open mic nights, or offering free support to great people with good ideas, but little money....</div>
<div>The challenge is to strike the right balance between profitable commercial ventures and supporting less wealthy, but worthy, events and people.</div>
<div>We believe that we have a great range of people who are professionals in the area of property, event management, marketing and purely enthusiastic about this venture. This will help to ensure that we can secure the right venue at the right time and then fill it with the perfect blend of events, some profitable and some for the love of the art. At the end of the day we will never lose sight that it is Show ""Business"" and without that understanding our days would be numbered. We are in this for the long game.</div> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<div>If you haven't the money, or the will to donate your money, that's OK with us of course. There are other ways to help us. </div>
<div>* Offer your time. Set aside perhaps two hours and find your own ways of spreading the word about the Campaign. Perhaps write a piece about it on a website, for a local newspaper, email the details to 100 friends, call your wealthy Great Aunt Mable and ask her to donate. Only you know best what your time could produce. The objectives are fundamentally to raise awareness and ultimately finance.<br/>
</div>
<div>* Share our postings, Twitter and Facebook, with positive comments about what we are doing and who we are.</div>
<div>* Do you have contacts in the media that might be interested in running a story on us? Let them know of this strange story; Cheeky Martini, celebrity connections and entertaining content. Increased exposure in mainstream radio, TV and print will be essential as the Campaign develops over the 5 weeks.</div>
<div>* Can you get unusual access somewhere that Cheeky Martini could make an appearance? Or maybe have some creative ideas for what Cheeky Martini might pop up for? He's a developing character so think big!</div>
<div>* Identify 5 people that you know personally and tell them about this campaign, ask them to support it. Ask them to ""Share"" the photos and video clips that we will be posting. Ask these 5 people to personally ask 5 of their own friends and family to do the same. The cumulative effect will be invaluable in drawing attention to the campaign and spreading the word, getting us trending.....<br/>
</div>
<div>* Can you offer skills or goods to support us? If you work at music festival could you perhaps blag some free tickets that we could offer up as a Reward to raise money this way? Perhaps you work in a lovely hotel and could offer a weekend break as a Perk for us to offer? If you are a property agent, could you help us to locate the venue or keep your eyes peeled? There are so many skills that could help, so many goods and good times that could Reward our supporters.</div>

Having worked in the media for over 10 years; a reporter on BBC Radio One, Documentary Producer/Director for MTV and with many credits on programmes aired on ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5... somehow I found myself running comedy nights as a hobby. 
Right now The Project offers more stage time to open mike comedians than anyone else in the UK. Around 350 ""spots"" provided every month, 6 shows per week at 2 venues. 
Professional comedians regularly headline our free shows and work out their new material alongside proven hits. This is a practice which almost every top comedian needs to do before the big tour or the TV appearance.

Two years ago I set 3 initial targets for the We Are Funny Project.
The first was to massively increase the amount of stage time available to the open mic comedy community. Nothing is more helpful to a developing comedian than stage time. If they are prepared to make the effort then we are ready to provide the stage.
Target number 2 was to attract the largest numbers of real audience for our shows. We have a fine and enthusiastic audience at most shows and we can offer them even more.
With stages 1 and 2 completed this campaign is all about getting us to Stage 3. That is, to create a permanent venue and be able to offer the acts ""pays days"" as well as ""play days"".
Sadly, we have just been informed we are to lose our spiritual home for the last 5 years. We remain on excellent terms with the management it was a decision beyond all our control. So while one door closes we wish to kick another door in......hence this Campaign.
You can listen to a full interview with Alfie Noakes on the history of the We Are Funny Project and the ambitions for the Campaign here:
http://simoncaine.co.uk/ATI/AlfieNoakes

We wish to open a brand new comedy club on the London landscape and to make it so much more than that. To have total 24/7 access to a stage/room and fill it with comedy and more, drawing in our regular punters and a whole new audience. 
We wish to build and nourish and help the comedy/live performance scene to flourish.
Our USP is to provide the complete Progression platform over time. For example, an audience member at an open mic night might decide that they want to ""give it a go"" and then they come and do just that. They work hard across the circuit and we offer them a longer 10 minute spot when ready. They continue to work hard on our stage and on others, maybe getting a headline 20 minute set on an open night. This is ultimately driving towards a paid middle spot on a weekend and then lining up towards headlining a weekend show for a paying and comedy savvy crowd.
Naturally we'll be paying for the established professional acts to come and rock the room at the weekends and various other occasions.
We hope to create a venue holding around 150 seats with a separate bar/coffee area that will be a ""hang-out"" for not just the audience before and after the shows, but for creative and funny people, as well as the general public, in the day times.
Should we be fortunate enough to reach our stretch goal then we would hope to have a second, smaller room. This would be used for more niche intimate shows, classes, training and workshops. Fundamentally this would allow us to dramatically expand the range of options we can offer by virtue of a wonderful economy of scale.
The space would be used to host comedy Workshops and Courses; writing, performing, MCing, etc. We have run many of these already. We would expand the range of Workshops available by entering new territory with such classes as ""How to Record and Stream a Podcast"", and so much more. Artists and Producers would be invited to come and suggest what they would like to use our space for...and thus keep The Project at the cutting edge,  productive and self-funding.
We wish to create a space where we are set up for podcast recording and streaming. We hope to be fully wired for sound and vision in order to deliver comedy content across any platform.
I have brought some TV show production value to the open mic comedy scene. One way in which we have achieved this is by creating/producing a number of comedy ""Formats"" which forces the stand-ups to generate new material and deliver the freshest comedy shows in town. Our numerous formats include:
Challenge-  Requires hand-picked comics to produce 5 new minutes of stand-up to a given theme which they receive only after agreeing to perform, along the lines of “Virginity” or “Best Job Ever”.
Hecklers - Is the only comedy show in town where the audience are actively encouraged to abuse the acts and the acts fight back.
Swapsies - Is the show where 2 very different comedians are teamed up and challenged to write 5 brand new minutes of material for their partner, who MUST perform it. No matter what. What would you do if you could push any words into another persons mouth and make them regurgitate them.....?

Tales - A themed Storytelling night
Variety - A family friendly old school Variety show with twists, always themed and bizarre, musical comedy, improv, stand-up and a range of weirdness.
Sexes - Cross-dressing character Comedy at its’ finest.
Types - Lampooning Types of the “Arche” and “Stereo” forms.
Pitches - As though addressing a Hollywood mogul, here’s the idea for a crazy movie, from a stand-up comedian.
Wisdom - The comedian has 5 minutes to address the 5 year old version of themselves and can give them some life advice.
Bedtime - A wildly inappropriate bedtime story for the audience, not a child who is all tucked-up.
Stars - Review of the film career of a major star, one film at a time, to create a witty arc and retrospective.

The Project has the largest dedicated comedy meetup.com group in the country with around 1100 members who represent real audience/supporters and is growing all the time.
http://www.meetup.com/We-Are-Funny-Free-Comedy-Nights-Opp-Liverpool-St-Station/
We have over 2600 members of our closed Facebook group (comprised almost exclusively of acts)
https://www.facebook.com/groups/wearefunnyproject/
We have around 1700 ""Likes"" and a 4.9 out of 5 Star review status on our public Facebook page
https://www.facebook.com/thewearefunnyproject
Plus we have closing on 1500 Twitter Followers @werfunnyproject
These are clear signifiers of the support and reach we have from the comedy community, acts and audience alike.
Magic, music, cabaret and simple weirdness make regular appearances on our stage. Frequently funny, sometimes hilarious. It's not only stand up comedians who get the laughs with the We Are Funny Project.
The show(s) must go on......
We are fortunate to have the admiration and support of established, talented and famous comedians who have been generous in letting it be known that they support what we are trying to achieve. Some have already recorded endorsements for us and we understand that more will weigh-in as the Campaign develops into July 2015.
The open mic comedy community is extraordinarily diverse and we are fortunate to have many volunteers to assist us with matters ranging from PR to photography, business advice to installing sound systems...there is a lot of community support built in to the operation, with services offered to us for free or at a considerable discount. We can get great ""bang for our buck"" thanks to the help of these good people.
Since the claim to be ""Funny"" is in our very title, this Campaign is designed to entertain and amuse and as such we have hatched a ""mascot"" in the form of Cheeky Martini. Our mascot will be undertaking some silly, even dangerous, missions over the Campaign period.
However, his is an emerging character and as time goes on, new layers to his weirdness, wit, wisdom and boldness will be revealed. Cheeky Martini has every likelihood to go viral, trend on Twitter and catch the interest of not just the supportive comics and comedy fans but the mainstream press as well.
Cheeky Martini will become especially visible each time that a funding milestone is reached, keeping the Campaign fresh and entertaining throughout. Fellow artists are lining up behind us to help Cheeky Martini do, and be, all that he can be. 
At the end of the day it's about creating opportunities and bringing great laughs.   
What We Need 

We are hoping to raise £90, 000. Where possible we would source from other members of the community. If a comedian is also an electrician for his day job we'd look to hire that person first, assuming that they are properly qualified and reasonably priced.
Funds will be used to secure a venue, with the lions' share going on advance rent and deposit. London is not a cheap City.
However, by the day we open for business we shall need to have:
* Advertising, printed publicity materials and to have re-vamped the website
* Acquired food, alcohol and entertainments licenses from the local authority
* Fitted a stage with quality lighting arrangement
* Furnished the performance space with around 150 linked chairs and a number of tables for drinks and food
* Installed a computer network for general work, editing, uploading and keeping on top of social media, marketing and VT production
* Additional microphones and cameras so that performances, podcasts, lectures and more can be recorded/streamed at a very high standard
* Re-modeled and decorated the venue/room to make it ideal for the purpose of hosting live performances and gatherings
* Furnished and decorated the bar/cafe area with comfortable seating and space for the customers (though we would wish for the space to be used by local artists to display their work for sale and create a flow of changing decor while working with our community)
* Installed and stocked a kitchen, with food display and serving area
* Fixed both exterior and interior signage and on-site advertising for our own events

* Installed and stocked the bar in a fashion that we can serve many people simultaneously, as we will surely have clear ""rush"" periods for refreshments
* Cash registers, electronic point of sale equipment, phones, internet, etc
* Deposits for key utilities; gas, electricity and water
* Our basic office furniture which is needed to work, desk and chairs, folders, shelving, etc
* Paid public insurance premiums
* Security systems; alarms, CCTV, hard drive recorder
* Paid professional fees such as legal costs and accountancy
* Obtained necessary items such as tools, ladders, cleaning equipment, etc
* Addressed additional elements such as soundproofing, coat check, box office, etc
* Last but not least, some of the our Perks are amazing but will cost some money to deliver upon and this has to be taken into account. Examples, teachers would still need to be paid to run Workshops. There will be a clear cost in putting on the super-charged opening weekend shows for which we hope to advance sell the tickets to our supporters here.

What You GetThe We Are Funny Project is not asking for something for nothing. We believe that our major appeal is ""the big picture"" of creating a hub that is committed to comedy in particular and the arts in general. 
The world will be a better place with a one-stop-shop for comedy and comedians of all levels in addition to the learning and production opportunities we will offer. Besides, a welcoming cafe and bar sitting within such a special place will have its' own appeal.
However, we have some special treats for our supporters, be they performers or patrons!
A small donation means that you will get a special video message from Cheeky Martini himself, a larger donation means (if you are London local) the man himself will come and do some poor quality cleaning of your house for an extremely limited time period. he will entertain you in the process of course, live and in the flesh.
There are comedy CDs, DVDs and books as produced by our friends, autographed as you request.
We are offering places on the variety of Workshops we'll be holding in the coming months, some will happen even before we open up the venue itself. Tickets for future shows will be available to donors, or if you are feeling extra generous you could have a pair of tickets for life, for any show we ever stage, the ""Golden"" tickets.
Maybe you'd like to have the full run of the club for a day and a night and have our complete support in you running your own event, no matter what it is?
We'll be changing the Perks on a regular basis, offering different incentives to get involved. Some will be small but worthy, others might have a high value and will be offered at an appropriate rate.
We hope that some of our supporters will offer up goods and services for us to make available to future donors and keep the Campaign running, ever fresh and rewarding.
If We Do Not Reach Our Target....
Then we shall have to re-consider the plan and strategy in view of the finance we have been able to raise. Perhaps we could still achieve the goal but with a smaller room, or compromising on locating to the precise Central London area that we have in mind.
The funds that are raised would most certainly be used to further the mission to open a new, complete progression, comedy venue. However, the ambition and scale would clearly need to be scaled down. It may be a case of seeking private investment to supplement the Crowdfunded money.

If We Exceed Our Target....
Then we will be very happy bunnies indeed and would look to have a second, smaller, room available in the club. This would mean we would be more free to run rehearsals, weekly courses and the like, keeping the main room entirely free for bigger events and larger crowds. 
This would create an economy of scale so that we could offer much more, for only a little extra investment and space. We would stagger shows and classes so that there would be a steady flow through the bar and cafe rather than huge crowds and queues for short periods, then relative quiet, allowing for better service and improved business practice.
   The Impact
Our new venue is designed to offer the most for the newest acts on the scene. Good stage, good crowds, good company...opportunities to come and watch the best; be taught by the funniest and most talented. Our mission is to generate more and more quality laughter in the world and we know just the people who want to do that....comedians. And those who love them.
Five years ago it was two shows a month in the basement of a pub. In May 2015 we ran 27 different shows, including 4 Edinburgh Previews with major comedy names, plus a Workshop on ""How To MC A Comedy Show"".
Even with around 350 ""spots"" each month we are still over-subscribed and The Project is well-regarded by almost everyone who performs with us. 
In a world where we are looking at the screen so very often it's a fine thing to see some vital performances, laugh so hard that your bum wiggles and keep live comedy strong and healthy. We have been with the grass roots for a while and some of our friends are truly emerging talents....we have the knowledge, the contacts, the audience, the vision and ambition. It's the venue that is the issue.
The Project is keen to bring stand-up comedy to young people whether by taking Workshops into schools or opening our doors to youth groups during the days in school holidays we feel we can offer a wonderfully fun interest for the very newest generation of potential comedians and performers. 
    Risks & Challenges
The single biggest issue is the ""chicken and egg"" matter of the Venue. We need to have funds in place so we can move like lightning when we locate the ideal, available home for the project.
We recently identified a near-perfect venue in all regards; size, set-up, location, history and reputation as a live events setting. The rent was very expensive. However little would have needed to be done with regard to re-modelling so one saving would have off-set the other cost. 
This venue was taken up by a third party extremely quickly. We are able to use the numbers and stats as a fair comparative for what we would be looking for and would need to pay.
The fact is that we will need to have the funds in place so we can secure the right venue, when we find it, fast and efficiently. 
It is simply not practical to find the venue, ask them to wait 2 - 3 months while we set up and run a campaign, and hope we raise the funds. It really has to be the case of Crowdfund now and be ready to pounce when the time is right.
We believe that it will be a tough ask to fund a Central London venue only by ticketed events. Our business model requires we have various revenue streams and not reliant on any single one. Bar and food sales will be significant. Workshops and courses, renting out the space for photo-shoots, lectures, rehearsals etc will also be vital.
We will have a wonderful space, fully kitted and easy on the eye. It should be used as much as possible by a diverse range of people, all paying in (one way or another) to keep the business viable. We will then have the luxury of supplementing open mic nights, or offering free support to great people with good ideas, but little money....
The challenge is to strike the right balance between profitable commercial ventures and supporting less wealthy, but worthy, events and people.
We believe that we have a great range of people who are professionals in the area of property, event management, marketing and purely enthusiastic about this venture. This will help to ensure that we can secure the right venue at the right time and then fill it with the perfect blend of events, some profitable and some for the love of the art. At the end of the day we will never lose sight that it is Show ""Business"" and without that understanding our days would be numbered. We are in this for the long game.   Other Ways You Can Help
If you haven't the money, or the will to donate your money, that's OK with us of course. There are other ways to help us. 
* Offer your time. Set aside perhaps two hours and find your own ways of spreading the word about the Campaign. Perhaps write a piece about it on a website, for a local newspaper, email the details to 100 friends, call your wealthy Great Aunt Mable and ask her to donate. Only you know best what your time could produce. The objectives are fundamentally to raise awareness and ultimately finance.

* Share our postings, Twitter and Facebook, with positive comments about what we are doing and who we are.
* Do you have contacts in the media that might be interested in running a story on us? Let them know of this strange story; Cheeky Martini, celebrity connections and entertaining content. Increased exposure in mainstream radio, TV and print will be essential as the Campaign develops over the 5 weeks.
* Can you get unusual access somewhere that Cheeky Martini could make an appearance? Or maybe have some creative ideas for what Cheeky Martini might pop up for? He's a developing character so think big!
* Identify 5 people that you know personally and tell them about this campaign, ask them to support it. Ask them to ""Share"" the photos and video clips that we will be posting. Ask these 5 people to personally ask 5 of their own friends and family to do the same. The cumulative effect will be invaluable in drawing attention to the campaign and spreading the word, getting us trending.....

* Can you offer skills or goods to support us? If you work at music festival could you perhaps blag some free tickets that we could offer up as a Reward to raise money this way? Perhaps you work in a lovely hotel and could offer a weekend break as a Perk for us to offer? If you are a property agent, could you help us to locate the venue or keep your eyes peeled? There are so many skills that could help, so many goods and good times that could Reward our supporters.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

HOUSE #30 is the latest solo theatre piece written and performed by Mik Kuhlman, taking place in and around a suspended silk house created by textile artist Patricia Toovey. This is a personal story about losing a house to a fire and finding home in the ashes. It's filled with island lore, ghost stories, physicality, humor, and heart.

Mik has gathered a beautifully talented team of professionals from Seattle and New York. We are running this campaign to raise the funds necessary to cover their labor and material costs.


Your support fuels Independent Theatre.



Two years in the making, HOUSE #30 has already been profound in its journey. It continues to resonate with audiences, from its conception on Vashon Island to sections presented around a Northwest campfire; in a Manhattan gallery, Brooklyn loft, and Portland living room; and as part of New York's Artistic New Directions GO SOLO Festival. We are excited to present HOUSE #30, in its entirety, to Seattle audiences for the first time, then to NYC and on a path to tour.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Who are we?</p> <ul> <li><p>The Norm Foster Theatre <span>Festival is a theatre company inspired by the work of
internationally renowned Canadian playwright Norm Foster. It is our mission to
showcase the heart and humour of Foster’s writing in a dedicated
environment, employing the finest Canadian theatre practitioners and to foster and support emerging
and established Canadian playwrights interested in stories that are
entertaining but also deeply meaningful to and reflective of our audience.</span></p></li> <li>In the past 4 years, as Norm and Patricia toured <i>On a First Name Basis</i> throughout Ontario
and other parts of Canada as well as internationally, they became aware that
many in the audience had come to the theatre for the first time in their lives
– and not just 20 somethings but older working class people.  Time and again, they were told that their
audience’s experience at the show was a revelation.  These new theatregoers were moved by the fact
that their lives, loves and heartaches were reflected on the stage and
delightfully surprised at how they could be in tears one moment and exploding
in laughter the next. <br/><br/>
</li> <li>At The Foster Festival, we aim to celebrate the
importance of popular, heartfelt theatre in the lives of everyday people and its
resonance with audiences. In these
communities, along with the numerous others Norm and Patricia played, they
heard the same praise expressed over and over, sometimes with different levels
of eloquence, but always with the same message – this  story spoke to ME.  It is not an accident that Norm Foster is the
most produced playwright in Canada and has achieved an international
reputation. His craft and interest in the world we actually live in give voice
to the many who feel they are rarely heard and it is with great pride that here
at The Foster Festival, we enjoy the opportunity to “entertain.”<br/><br/>

<b> SUMMARY OF OUR CAMPAIGN<br/><br/></b><p>    IntenCity Dance project  was a dream of our founder Calvin's for a long time. His dream became a reality when he founded IntenCity dance Project in September of 2014.  Wanting to start small with a handful of founding dancers  and company members to create a family atmosphere where dancers could come to learn, train hard, and be surrounded with positive energy. IntenCity was founded on the basis of 
learning a professional career while enjoying the world of dance around 
you and learning from great teachers.</p>
<p>    Our dancers have trained hard and are looking forward to and  are ready for the challenge of nationals. The experience of a week long convention to train with amazing choreographers, the chance to get on that big stage and show everyone their hard work and where they are now. Being a smaller company raising funds isn't as easy and we want our dancers and their families to concentrate on the performance and not the money.</p>
<p>   Your contribution would allow our dancers to fulfill this dream of nationals, for an experience they will remember always. In return we would like to offer you our thanks and gratitude. We have many perks we are ready to give out  as a way of showing our thanks. Please check them out.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b> WHAT DO WE NEED??? WHAT CAN WE OFFER YOU??</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>   Realistically  for all of our company members to attend the Nationals convention and competition we would need $7200.00. I began the campaign at $5600 because that would at least cover most of competition costs for our dancers. We would be  ecstatic to   raise well beyond our goal of course.</p>
<p>  We are offering a wide range of  perks for those who help us out. From shout outs on FB and Instagram to baked good, to videos, gifts etc. Please check them out and find one that appeals to you.</p>
<p> If we do not raise all the money needed we will apply it to the costs and  that will definitely help us get the dancers to the event.<br/></p>

<p>Esame trijų žmonių komanda: Arnas Stučinskas, Evelina Brėdikytė, Sigita Pikturnaitė. Iki ateinančio rudens norime įrengti naują kamerinį teatrą (kūrybinę studiją) Vilniaus miesto centre, kuriame kiekvieną dieną vyktų spektakliai, koncertai, teatriniai užsiėmimai vaikams, studentams, šeimoms. Radome tinkamas patalpas nuomai, su interjeristu sukūrėme patalpų multifunkcinės erdvės koncepciją (vizualizacijos aprašymo apačioje), turime tam tikrą dalį įrangos, veiklos planą visiems ateinantiems metams ir verslo planą.</p>
<p>Projekto įdėją plėtojame metus, esame investavę daug savo laiko ir jėgų. Tikime tuo, ką darome. Esame ištyrę rinką ir žinome, kad tai reikalinga Vilniaus miestui, nes 1) turime žymiai daugiau aktorių ir trupių nei vietų jiems save parodyti, 2) realizuosime trūkstamus veiklos modelius šioje industrijoje, 3) įkursime kultūrinio bendradarbiavimo, mentorystės ir filantropijos programas, padėsiančias jauniems kūrėjams realizuoti savo idėjas ir kt.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Finansinė dalis</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Savo jėgomis surinksime lėšas ir investuosime į patalpų įrengimą (10241 eurą) ir kitas projekto pradžiai būtinas išlaidas. Tačiau tokio pobūdžio veiklai rasti lėšų yra itin sunku, nes, pavyzdžiui, bankai ir kredito unijos neskolina dėl rizikos, privatūs investuotojai domisi tik globaliais interneriniais projektais. Dėl šios priežasties nusprendėme ieškoti žmonių pagalbos vienai projekto sudedamajai daliai – <b>šviesų ir garso įrangos įsigijimui</b>. Ši sritis pasirinkda dėl to, kad tai įsigyti galime paskiausiai, todėl turime laiko lėšų rinkimui. <b>5078 eurų</b> suma pasirinkta remiantis pasiūlymais, gautais iš įmonių ir yra lygiai tiek, kiek reikia būtinos įrangos pasirodymams įsigyti.</p>
<p>Jeigu šioje platformoje mums nepavyks surinkti pilnos sumos įrangos įsigyjimui, tuomet trūkstamai daliai rasti per kitus šaltinius turėsime dar mėnesį su puse - iki mūsų pirmųjų pasirodymų.</p>
<p>Mokėjimą galima atlikti ir banko kortele (per PayPal, bet neprisijungus į pačią PayPal sistemą).</p>

</div>","(the text in English - below)Apie projektą
Esame trijų žmonių komanda: Arnas Stučinskas, Evelina Brėdikytė, Sigita Pikturnaitė. Iki ateinančio rudens norime įrengti naują kamerinį teatrą (kūrybinę studiją) Vilniaus miesto centre, kuriame kiekvieną dieną vyktų spektakliai, koncertai, teatriniai užsiėmimai vaikams, studentams, šeimoms. Radome tinkamas patalpas nuomai, su interjeristu sukūrėme patalpų multifunkcinės erdvės koncepciją (vizualizacijos aprašymo apačioje), turime tam tikrą dalį įrangos, veiklos planą visiems ateinantiems metams ir verslo planą.
Projekto įdėją plėtojame metus, esame investavę daug savo laiko ir jėgų. Tikime tuo, ką darome. Esame ištyrę rinką ir žinome, kad tai reikalinga Vilniaus miestui, nes 1) turime žymiai daugiau aktorių ir trupių nei vietų jiems save parodyti, 2) realizuosime trūkstamus veiklos modelius šioje industrijoje, 3) įkursime kultūrinio bendradarbiavimo, mentorystės ir filantropijos programas, padėsiančias jauniems kūrėjams realizuoti savo idėjas ir kt.


Finansinė dalis

Savo jėgomis surinksime lėšas ir investuosime į patalpų įrengimą (10241 eurą) ir kitas projekto pradžiai būtinas išlaidas. Tačiau tokio pobūdžio veiklai rasti lėšų yra itin sunku, nes, pavyzdžiui, bankai ir kredito unijos neskolina dėl rizikos, privatūs investuotojai domisi tik globaliais interneriniais projektais. Dėl šios priežasties nusprendėme ieškoti žmonių pagalbos vienai projekto sudedamajai daliai – šviesų ir garso įrangos įsigijimui. Ši sritis pasirinkda dėl to, kad tai įsigyti galime paskiausiai, todėl turime laiko lėšų rinkimui. 5078 eurų suma pasirinkta remiantis pasiūlymais, gautais iš įmonių ir yra lygiai tiek, kiek reikia būtinos įrangos pasirodymams įsigyti.
Jeigu šioje platformoje mums nepavyks surinkti pilnos sumos įrangos įsigyjimui, tuomet trūkstamai daliai rasti per kitus šaltinius turėsime dar mėnesį su puse - iki mūsų pirmųjų pasirodymų.
Mokėjimą galima atlikti ir banko kortele (per PayPal, bet neprisijungus į pačią PayPal sistemą).

Ką gaunate Jūs?

1. Jums bus skirta vieta mūsų tinklalapio houseofpuglu.com garbės puslapyje :)
2. Iki gruodžio mėnesio pabaigos padarysime mažiausiai penkių pasirodymų vaizdo įrašus ir patalpinsime juos internete. Visiems prisidėjusiems prie mūsų projekto bent 10 eurų išsiųsime unikalius kodus, su kuriais galėsite žiūrėti mūsų įrašus.
3. Tiems, kurie prisidės 15 ar daugiau eurų - padovanosim kvietimą į spektaklį arba koncertą. Asmeniškai suderinsim tinkamą laiką.
4. Jeigu paremsite 99 ar daugiau eurų - užrašysime Jūsų vardą ant vienos iš teatro kėdžių!
Iššūkiai, stiprybės
Turime profesionalios, ilgametės patirties renginių organizavime, vaidyboje, režisūroje, kultūros vadyboje, viešinime. Esame dirbe teatro trupėse, renginių organizavimo įmonėse, kūrybinėse / web studijose. Evelina yra baigusi vaidybos studijas ir turi magistro laipsnį, kartu su Arnu įkūrė projektą mimai.lt, Sigutė – baigusi menotyros ir vaidybos studijas, turi du magistro laipsnius.
Šio projekto realizavimui turime daug reikalingų kompetencijų, tačiau susiduriame ir su tokiomis problemomis, kurias vieniems įveikti būtų sunku. Esame labai dėkingi savo draugams, kurie mums stipriai padeda teisiniais klausimais, darant rinkodaros ir strategijos sprendimus ir kt. Turime daug palaikymo ir daug būsimų patrnerių tolimesnėje projekto eigoje.

Taip pat turime daug patirties informacinių technologijų srityje. Arnas sėkmingai kuria reprezentacines svetaines ir sudėtingesnes internetines sistemas. Tai didelis koziris projekto viešinime ir įvaizdžio kūrime, padedantis ne tik sutaupyti, bet ir rasti šaltinių papildomoms pajamoms projektui įgyvendinti.

Jeigu norite, bet negalite finansiškai prisidėti prie mūsų projekto, tuomet mums labai pagelbėtų, jeigu pasidalintimėt apie tai su savo pažįstamais - socialiniuose tinkluose, elektroniniu paštu etc.

<h3>Who We Are </h3> <p>She Is A Problem began over a year ago as an investigation into why, as a society, we are more comfortable with <i>dead</i> female artists than <i>living </i>female artists? </p>
<p>Six fellow female artists came together with the intent of creating an original work focusing on the lives, bodies of work, and suicides of Francesca Woodman, Sylvia Plath, Anne Sexton, Diane Arbus, and Kay Sage. What resulted was <i>She Is A Problem</i>, an immersive art gallery and performance piece that illuminates both the beauty in their art and the darkness surrounding their deaths. It also asks who are these women when liberated from an idealized Western suicidal facade? The show ran at Vox Populi in Philadelphia, PA during the Fringe/Fringe festival August 28-30. </p>

She wants to create theatrical experiences that push boundaries—of what we think bodies can do, of what we think narrative can do, of what we think theater can do. She is so grateful for working with this amazing ensemble of women and can’t wait to see where life takes her next.</p>

The She Is A Problem Collective
Emily Alexander || aspires to be more problematic in the future; this piece is just the beginning of her journey to finding her voice. She makes theater because when you move others, you create waves. She wants to create theatrical experiences that push boundaries—of what we think bodies can do, of what we think narrative can do, of what we think theater can do. She is so grateful for working with this amazing ensemble of women and can’t wait to see where life takes her next.



Nia Benjamin || is an emerging Philadelphia theatre artist currently pursuing her BFA Acting degree from the University of the Arts. She devotes her spare time to things that make her happy, especially crushing the patriarchy. She is honored to be among this innovative group of lady theatre warriors. 




Kahla Brown || is an artist struggling with the place and value of art in a world torn up by ignorance and oppression. She believes the greatest hope for women lies in the formation of communities and disinterest in competition. She believes the greatest way to solve problems is to ask questions. She hopes you arrive at She Is A Problem with a lot of questions, and leave with even more.



Rebecca Buckley || is a movement based performer, a writer, and an artist in search of change. She devises to shed light not only on tragedies, but victories as well. In 2014, Rebecca graduated from University of the Arts with a BFA in Acting. She is a Problem is Rebecca’s fourth devised show she has had the special privilege to be part of creating.



Gracie Martin || is an actor, singer, writer and explorative artist. Devised theatre came into her life in a big way when trying to wrap her mind around the fraught and frustrating progression of human rights in Russia. Gracie believes not only in revolt against forces that harm women, but in positive, creative endeavors that celebrate what feminists throughout history have fought for, while also asking audiences explore and discover their own path to a more equal society.



Amy Harper || is a designer, writer, illustrator, and educator. She is a compulsive creator and believes in spreading ideas like dandelion seeds in the hopes that if a hundred and one are thrown at least a few will bloom. Amy believes in seeking out and recording both the whimsical magic of our world along with its dysfunctional cruelty.

</b></p><p> Our passion and enthusiasm for the art of
BALLET is our driving force!</p>
<p>Our inspiration comes
from our love for CHILDREN!</p>
<p>Athens Children’s
Ballet is a non-profit organization founded in 2013, amid the difficulties of
the Greek economy.  We were willing to
take the risk, however, as we believe that Art has a healing power and is the
noblest reaction in times of crisis. </p>
<p>We aspire to motivate our
youngsters and encourage them to set higher goals, to be creative, to enrich
their artistic expression. To form the group we audition young dancers (10-22
years old), from all over Greece, and those selected are rigorously trained and
prepared by highly skilled professionals to participate in a classic repertoire
ballet performance.</p>
<p>“Snow white” (2013)
and “Cinderella” (2014) are our two productions up to now, attended by more
than 3.000 spectators, who are eagerly awaiting  our next production, “Beauty and the Beast” , to
be staged in Athens on November 28th and 29th, 2015.</p>
<p><b>Why we need your
support</b></p>
<p>Athens Children’s
Ballet is an initiative taken by dancers and teachers of classical ballet with
years of experience and profound knowledge of the subject. It is an independent
operator not financed by any public or private organization. Ticket sales are
its only source of revenue. Your support will enable us to continue our mission
as well as our <b>social work</b>.</p>
<p>It should be noted
that our scope is not limited to the ballet productions. We are concerned with
the further development and career opportunities for our children. Thus, every
year, our most talented dancers are rewarded with <b>scholarships</b> to attend courses at professional dance schools in
Europe. Moreover a significant number of <b>complimentary</b>
tickets for our performances are offered to people in need –especially
children, who enjoy it tremendously. We also <b>visit various institutions</b>, e.g. orphanages, to give small
performances for free.</p>
<p>Our yearly productions
are choreographed by professional choreographers, who join us from abroad.  Teaching, training, rehearsals take countless
hours of hard work. Costumes, fittings, stage sets are of the finest quality.
To keep these high standards expenses are always exceeding revenue.</p>
<p><b>Consequently your
contribution will help us: </b></p>
<p>To offer two
scholarships to our best students</p>
<p>To cover the expenses
of the production (costumes, scenery, etc)</p>
<p>To pay the fees and temporary
accommodation of the choreographer </p>
<p>If financial support
is not an option please share with friends and ask them to promote our vision
and efforts.</p>

<p>Το Athens Children’s Ballet είναι μια μη κερδοσκοπική νεανική
ομάδα μπαλέτου. Δημιουργήθηκε στην Ελλάδα το 2013, σε μια δύσκολη για τον τόπο
μας περίοδο, με την πεποίθηση ότι η Τέχνη έχει δύναμη και αποτελεί την πιο
ευγενική απάντηση στους καιρούς της κρίσης. Στόχος μας είναι, οι μικροί
χορευτές να καλλιεργούν υψηλούς στόχους, τη δημιουργικότητα και την
καλλιτεχνική τους έκφραση. </p>
<p>Παρουσιάζουμε γνωστά έργα
κλασικού ρεπερτορίου σε δύο πράξεις, δίνοντας 
την ευκαιρία σε νεαρούς χορευτές (10 – 22 ετών) από όλη την Ελλάδα, που
επιλέγονται με audition, να αποκτούν
εμπειρία και γνώση μέσα από την προετοιμασία μιας παράστασης με επαγγελματικές
προδιαγραφές και απαιτήσεις. </p>
<p>Μέχρι σήμερα, το Athens Children’s Ballet έχει παρουσιάσει τα
έργα <i>Η Χιονάτη και οι 7 Νάνοι </i>(2013) και <i>Η Σταχτοπούτα</i> (2014),
που έχουν παρακολουθήσει περισσότεροι από <b>3.000 θεατές</b>. </p>

κοινό, ετοιμάζουμε φέτος τη νέα μας παραγωγή, το μπαλέτο η «Πεντάμορφη &amp;

<p>Το Athens Children’s Ballet έχει ξεκινήσει από

<h2>¡FLACC! Mission Statement</h2>
<p>¡FLACC! supports emerging and established Dance Artists of the Latin@ Diaspora who are choosing to make dances of the non-traditional, border-crossing, rule-breaking, cutting-edge, queer, avant-garde, contemporary, curious, experimental, abstract, sensitive, hybridized, neo-classical, or revolutionary varieties.  For our purposes, choreographers with “Latin American” cultural heritage or ancestry are defined by all countries that speak Spanish, Portuguese, or Indigenous languages in the Americas- from the Borderlands of the US to the tip of South America, including the Caribbean Islands.  Indigenous contemporary choreographers of North America and all US-born Chican@s and Latin@s are also invited to apply to this Festival.<br/><br/>¡FLACC! celebrates our heritage, our inclusive identities and our artistic innovations through multi-media contemporary dance performance.  We are committed to making contemporary dance practice and performance accessible to underserved Latin@ communities and to creating a platform of connection in the dance community locally and internationally.   See <a href=""http://www.flaccdanza.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.flaccdanza.org</a></p>

<h3></h3>
<h3>Your support brings social change</h3>
<p><b>Inclusión:</b> We aim to create a welcoming space for audiences and artists to deeply engage with unique Latin@ perspectives crossing barriers related to race, place, class, ability, gender and sexual identity. ¡FLACC! is also committed to giving our greater community of Latino@s more access and exposure to contemporary modern and experimental dance forms by offering low-cost dance classes, a free panel discussion with the artists and placing our work on a stage that specifically houses Latin@ artists.</p>
<p><b>Voces Internacionales:</b>  Director, Liz Duran Boubion, is currently working to foster a bridge with contemporary dance artists in Mexico and seeks to invite choreographers from other countries and states as we grow.  ¡FLACC!  allows us to share our experience and innovation globally with each other as immigrants, locals, mixed-race Latin@'s and international artists within the dance community. </p>
<p><b>La Raza/Meeting each other:</b> Our sustainability depends on our collaborations with each other and we are rapidly creating a recognizable platform for Latin@ choreographers to meet one another under one roof.  Our cultural identities can often become insignificant within the contemporary dance world. ¡FLACC! puts cultural perspective at the center by supporting Latin@ choreographers.  To date, the emotional response of ¡FLACC! audiences and the power of our connection to each other is immense.  ¡FLACC! allows us to share ideas and experiences with one another, claim our diverse identities and find out who's out there. </p>

<h3><b>Misión -
¡FLACC!</b></h3>
<p>¡FLACC! apoya artistas – bailarines emergentes y
establecidos de la diáspora Latina: Sur y Centro Americana, que  han optado por hacer danza no tradicional,
cruzando las fronteras, rompiendo las reglas, siendo vanguardistas, raros ó
extraños, contemporáneos, curiosos, experimentales, abstractos, sensibles ,
híbridos, Neoclásico,  revolucionarios.
Para nuestro propósito, los coreógrafos “Latino American@s” que hacen parte del
patrimonio cultural se definen por  los
países que hablan español, portugués o lenguas indígenas en las Américas: desde
las tierras fronterizas de los EE.UU. a la punta de América del Sur, incluyendo
las islas del Caribe. Invitamos también a los coreógrafos contemporáneos
Indígenas de América del Norte y todos los nacidos en Estados Unidos Chican@s
latin@s a participar del Festival.</p>
<p>¡FLACC! celebra nuestro patrimonio cultural,  nuestras identidades inclusivas y nuestras
innovaciones artísticas con espectáculos multi-media de  danza contemporánea. Estamos comprometidos a
hacer que la danza contemporánea y sus performances estén al alcance de las
comunidades Latinas marginadas y a crear una plataforma de conexiones en la
comunidad de la danza a nivel nacional e internacional. Ver<b>  <span><a href=""http://www.flaccdanza.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.flaccdanza.org</a></span></b></p>
<p></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440557955/ssjzrfaad2envtdtsods.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Foto: Marisa Aragona/David Herrera Performance Company<br/>
<p><b>Su apoyo trae
cambio social</b></p>
<p><b>Inclusión:</b>
Nuestro objetivo es crear un espacio de participación  seguro para el público y los artistas con
perspectiva latina eliminando las barreras de raza, lugar, clase social, capacidades,
género e inclinación sexual. ¡FLACC! también se ha comprometido a brindarle
mayor acceso a nuestra comunidad Latina a las formas de danza moderna y
experimental contemporánea, ofreciendo clases de baile a bajo costo, un panel
de discusión gratuito con artistas  y a realizar
una puesta en escena exclusivamente para artistas latin@s.</p>
<p><b>Voces
Internacionales:</b> Directora, Liz Duran Boubion. Está trabajando
para fomentar un puente con artistas de danza contemporánea en México y busca
invitar a coreógrafos de otros países y estados en la  medida en que crece el festival. ¡FLACC! nos
permite compartir nuestra experiencia y la innovación a nivel mundial entre sí
como inmigrantes, locales, mestizos Lati@s 
y artistas internacionales dentro de la comunidad de la danza.</p>
<p><b>La Raza /
Reuniéndonos entre sí</b>: Nuestro sostenibilidad depende de
la  colaboración de los unos con los
otros y estamos creando rápidamente una plataforma reconocible para coreógrafos
Latin@s,  para cubrirnos mutuamente bajo el
mismo techo. Nuestras identidades culturales a menudo pueden llegar a ser
insignificante en el mundo de la danza contemporánea. ¡FLACC! pone perspectiva
cultural en el centro apoyando a los coreógraf@s latin@s. A la fecha, la
respuesta del público hacia  ¡FLACC! y el
poder de nuestra conexión con los demás es gigantesca. ¡FLACC! nos permite
compartir ideas y experiencias con otros, reclamar por nuestras diversas
identidades y encontrar a quien está ahí afuera.</p>

El Festival Latinoamericano de coreógrafos contemporáneos les da la bienvenida.



Your donation is bringing visibility, accessibility and inclusion to underserved Latin@ choreographers and communities.


Imagine September 25, 26 & 27, 2015 at the Mission Cultural Center Theater packed to capacity with 150 people each night and an inspired audience buzzing with excitement to see 7 outstanding local Chican@/Latin@ choreographers making high level dance theater production. 


It is our 2nd year and we are quickly growing. Our goal is to triple our audience size from last year within a larger venue and include our fantastic teaching series this year.  We just need you!  ¡Te necesitamos!  
Our artists, dance teachers, administrators and presenters are committed to making contemporary dance performance and practice accessible to under-represented Latin@ communities and beyond. 
Your donation will directly support this vision and help us reach our goal this September 2015 event.

¡FLACC! Mission Statement
¡FLACC! supports emerging and established Dance Artists of the Latin@ Diaspora who are choosing to make dances of the non-traditional, border-crossing, rule-breaking, cutting-edge, queer, avant-garde, contemporary, curious, experimental, abstract, sensitive, hybridized, neo-classical, or revolutionary varieties.  For our purposes, choreographers with “Latin American” cultural heritage or ancestry are defined by all countries that speak Spanish, Portuguese, or Indigenous languages in the Americas- from the Borderlands of the US to the tip of South America, including the Caribbean Islands.  Indigenous contemporary choreographers of North America and all US-born Chican@s and Latin@s are also invited to apply to this Festival.¡FLACC! celebrates our heritage, our inclusive identities and our artistic innovations through multi-media contemporary dance performance.  We are committed to making contemporary dance practice and performance accessible to underserved Latin@ communities and to creating a platform of connection in the dance community locally and internationally.   See www.flaccdanza.org

Your support brings social change
Inclusión: We aim to create a welcoming space for audiences and artists to deeply engage with unique Latin@ perspectives crossing barriers related to race, place, class, ability, gender and sexual identity. ¡FLACC! is also committed to giving our greater community of Latino@s more access and exposure to contemporary modern and experimental dance forms by offering low-cost dance classes, a free panel discussion with the artists and placing our work on a stage that specifically houses Latin@ artists.
Voces Internacionales:  Director, Liz Duran Boubion, is currently working to foster a bridge with contemporary dance artists in Mexico and seeks to invite choreographers from other countries and states as we grow.  ¡FLACC!  allows us to share our experience and innovation globally with each other as immigrants, locals, mixed-race Latin@'s and international artists within the dance community. 
La Raza/Meeting each other: Our sustainability depends on our collaborations with each other and we are rapidly creating a recognizable platform for Latin@ choreographers to meet one another under one roof.  Our cultural identities can often become insignificant within the contemporary dance world. ¡FLACC! puts cultural perspective at the center by supporting Latin@ choreographers.  To date, the emotional response of ¡FLACC! audiences and the power of our connection to each other is immense.  ¡FLACC! allows us to share ideas and experiences with one another, claim our diverse identities and find out who's out there.

Misión -
¡FLACC!
¡FLACC! apoya artistas – bailarines emergentes y
establecidos de la diáspora Latina: Sur y Centro Americana, que  han optado por hacer danza no tradicional,
cruzando las fronteras, rompiendo las reglas, siendo vanguardistas, raros ó
extraños, contemporáneos, curiosos, experimentales, abstractos, sensibles ,
híbridos, Neoclásico,  revolucionarios.
Para nuestro propósito, los coreógrafos “Latino American@s” que hacen parte del
patrimonio cultural se definen por  los
países que hablan español, portugués o lenguas indígenas en las Américas: desde
las tierras fronterizas de los EE.UU. a la punta de América del Sur, incluyendo
las islas del Caribe. Invitamos también a los coreógrafos contemporáneos
Indígenas de América del Norte y todos los nacidos en Estados Unidos Chican@s
latin@s a participar del Festival.
¡FLACC! celebra nuestro patrimonio cultural,  nuestras identidades inclusivas y nuestras
innovaciones artísticas con espectáculos multi-media de  danza contemporánea. Estamos comprometidos a
hacer que la danza contemporánea y sus performances estén al alcance de las
comunidades Latinas marginadas y a crear una plataforma de conexiones en la
comunidad de la danza a nivel nacional e internacional. Ver  www.flaccdanza.org

Su apoyo trae
cambio social
Inclusión:
Nuestro objetivo es crear un espacio de participación  seguro para el público y los artistas con
perspectiva latina eliminando las barreras de raza, lugar, clase social, capacidades,
género e inclinación sexual. ¡FLACC! también se ha comprometido a brindarle
mayor acceso a nuestra comunidad Latina a las formas de danza moderna y
experimental contemporánea, ofreciendo clases de baile a bajo costo, un panel
de discusión gratuito con artistas  y a realizar
una puesta en escena exclusivamente para artistas latin@s.
Voces
Internacionales: Directora, Liz Duran Boubion. Está trabajando
para fomentar un puente con artistas de danza contemporánea en México y busca
invitar a coreógrafos de otros países y estados en la  medida en que crece el festival. ¡FLACC! nos
permite compartir nuestra experiencia y la innovación a nivel mundial entre sí
como inmigrantes, locales, mestizos Lati@s 
y artistas internacionales dentro de la comunidad de la danza.
La Raza /
Reuniéndonos entre sí: Nuestro sostenibilidad depende de
la  colaboración de los unos con los
otros y estamos creando rápidamente una plataforma reconocible para coreógrafos
Latin@s,  para cubrirnos mutuamente bajo el
mismo techo. Nuestras identidades culturales a menudo pueden llegar a ser
insignificante en el mundo de la danza contemporánea. ¡FLACC! pone perspectiva
cultural en el centro apoyando a los coreógraf@s latin@s. A la fecha, la
respuesta del público hacia  ¡FLACC! y el
poder de nuestra conexión con los demás es gigantesca. ¡FLACC! nos permite
compartir ideas y experiencias con otros, reclamar por nuestras diversas
identidades y encontrar a quien está ahí afuera.

<p></p>Cesar Garfiaz</strong><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;""> was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA. Growing up in a Mexican family full of women that loved to dance, he became the go to partner for all genres that played at parties whether it was Mexican banda music, salsa, merengue or cumbia. He began dancing Salsa at the age of seven, going on Sundays to Steven’s Steakhouse (a famous Salsa spot in Los Angeles). In high he joined a theater class where along with his natural dancing affinity he found a passion that would continue to help him into college. After studying in years of performing arts courses he gained a love for the stage. In 2004 Cesar joined UCLA’s Department of World Arts &amp; Cultures. As a part of UCLA’s Repertory Tour Ensemble, Cesar performed and inspired young people in high schools all over Los Angeles. Through his work with Rep Tour, he became passionate about youth arts education. He studied various styles including modern, hip hop, house, tai chi, Ghanaian, Mexican Folklorico &amp; Afro-Cuban solidifying him as a versatile dancer. </span><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">During his time at UCLA Cesar began working and collaborating with Ana Maria Alvarez and was a cast member of her original thesis concert “contra-tiempo.” This turned into the Urban Latin Dance Theater Company </span><em style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">CONTRA-TIEMPO</em><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">, a company rooted in Salsa and Afro-Cuban and draws from Hip-Hop, urban and contemporary dance-theater. They created an invigorating blend of physically intense and socially astute performance that pushed the boundaries of Latin dance as an expressive cultural and contemporary form. As a founding company member he invested 10 years in the company collaborating in the creation process, performing, touring world wide, and teaching as the lead teacher on behalf of the company.</span><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">In 2014 he co-founded Kinection Dance Project which explores the many different human relationships and the different ways we relate to the world using duets and multiple genres as a means of expression. Using partnering as a foundation Cesar hopes to give a new perspective to partnering movement. </span><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">As a passionate dance educator, Cesar has taught extensively from the studio level to all grade levels in schools to University level both nationally and internationally. As an artist he is passionate about continuing to explore movement in site-specific works in Los Angeles and bringing the idea of dance as an integral part of everyday society out in the streets.</span>

She is a Venezuelan American, born and raised in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Her fate was decided the moment she stepped in her first ballet class at 10 years old and fell in love with dance. She studied since then focusing on ballet and modern, even going on to pursue a BA in Dance at Western Michigan University after receiving a full scholarship. She studied with many wonderful teachers including Kathleen Hermsdorf, Donald McKayle, and Derrick Evans. During this time she was selected to be in many wonderful works such as Paul Taylor’s </span><em style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">Three Epitaphs</em><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;""> and was also chosen to be part of an ensemble that performed locally and even internationally in Prague.  </span><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">In 2002 she moved to Los Angeles where she spent the first many years focusing on studying Latin forms including salsa, cha cha, and pachanga. She performed salsa both on stage and on television/film for many years as well as winning many competitions including Baila mi Baile on Univision’s “Sabado Gigante.”During these years she became an acclaimed salsa dancer and teacher. She has been seen dancing in commercials such as Taco Bell and Coors, Television Show’s such as Luis and Dexter, and movies such as Along Came Polly and Mini’s First time. </span><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">In 2010 feeling the need to connect back to the classical beginning but not lose the Latin roots, Blanco was selected to be a part of CONTRA-TIEMPO Urban Latin Dance Company. The fusion of modern dance, many Latin forms, many urban forms, and theatre was a perfect fit. Here Blanco toured extensively nationally and internationally as part of a small cast of talented dancers. She was also a teaching artist for CONTRA-TIEMPO and active in the creation process of the works. As a highlight – In 2014, she was part of the cast who toured to South America for a month long tour for Dance Motion as cultural ambassadors for the United States. </span><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">Currently – Blanco co-founded Kinection Dance Project with partner/co-founder Cesar Garfiaz. Born out of their love and strength for performing and teaching partnering work – Kinection Dance Project explores the human connection both physically and metaphorically. Its concentration is on duets, each showcasing and exploring a different aspect of ever complicated and beautiful relationships. </span><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">As a movement educator Blanco has created curriculum and taught extensively partnering technique, performance technique, salsa, and modern dance. She has taught in school residencies, choreographed special projects, and taught workshops in schools across the country as well as internationally. She also has a great love for the culinary world and is certified in plant-based nutrition. She teaches cooking classes and gives lectures on the subject of “food be thy medicine.” During her many dance tours the cooking classes and lectures have often been a wonderful holistic addition allowing further connection to the community and body.</span>

Who are we?




Cesar Garfiaz was born and raised in Los Angeles, CA. Growing up in a Mexican family full of women that loved to dance, he became the go to partner for all genres that played at parties whether it was Mexican banda music, salsa, merengue or cumbia. He began dancing Salsa at the age of seven, going on Sundays to Steven’s Steakhouse (a famous Salsa spot in Los Angeles). In high he joined a theater class where along with his natural dancing affinity he found a passion that would continue to help him into college. After studying in years of performing arts courses he gained a love for the stage. In 2004 Cesar joined UCLA’s Department of World Arts & Cultures. As a part of UCLA’s Repertory Tour Ensemble, Cesar performed and inspired young people in high schools all over Los Angeles. Through his work with Rep Tour, he became passionate about youth arts education. He studied various styles including modern, hip hop, house, tai chi, Ghanaian, Mexican Folklorico & Afro-Cuban solidifying him as a versatile dancer. During his time at UCLA Cesar began working and collaborating with Ana Maria Alvarez and was a cast member of her original thesis concert “contra-tiempo.” This turned into the Urban Latin Dance Theater Company CONTRA-TIEMPO, a company rooted in Salsa and Afro-Cuban and draws from Hip-Hop, urban and contemporary dance-theater. They created an invigorating blend of physically intense and socially astute performance that pushed the boundaries of Latin dance as an expressive cultural and contemporary form. As a founding company member he invested 10 years in the company collaborating in the creation process, performing, touring world wide, and teaching as the lead teacher on behalf of the company.In 2014 he co-founded Kinection Dance Project which explores the many different human relationships and the different ways we relate to the world using duets and multiple genres as a means of expression. Using partnering as a foundation Cesar hopes to give a new perspective to partnering movement. As a passionate dance educator, Cesar has taught extensively from the studio level to all grade levels in schools to University level both nationally and internationally. As an artist he is passionate about continuing to explore movement in site-specific works in Los Angeles and bringing the idea of dance as an integral part of everyday society out in the streets.


Bianca Blanco is a dancer/choreographer and actress. She is a Venezuelan American, born and raised in Kalamazoo, Michigan. Her fate was decided the moment she stepped in her first ballet class at 10 years old and fell in love with dance. She studied since then focusing on ballet and modern, even going on to pursue a BA in Dance at Western Michigan University after receiving a full scholarship. She studied with many wonderful teachers including Kathleen Hermsdorf, Donald McKayle, and Derrick Evans. During this time she was selected to be in many wonderful works such as Paul Taylor’s Three Epitaphs and was also chosen to be part of an ensemble that performed locally and even internationally in Prague.  In 2002 she moved to Los Angeles where she spent the first many years focusing on studying Latin forms including salsa, cha cha, and pachanga. She performed salsa both on stage and on television/film for many years as well as winning many competitions including Baila mi Baile on Univision’s “Sabado Gigante.”During these years she became an acclaimed salsa dancer and teacher. She has been seen dancing in commercials such as Taco Bell and Coors, Television Show’s such as Luis and Dexter, and movies such as Along Came Polly and Mini’s First time. In 2010 feeling the need to connect back to the classical beginning but not lose the Latin roots, Blanco was selected to be a part of CONTRA-TIEMPO Urban Latin Dance Company. The fusion of modern dance, many Latin forms, many urban forms, and theatre was a perfect fit. Here Blanco toured extensively nationally and internationally as part of a small cast of talented dancers. She was also a teaching artist for CONTRA-TIEMPO and active in the creation process of the works. As a highlight – In 2014, she was part of the cast who toured to South America for a month long tour for Dance Motion as cultural ambassadors for the United States. Currently – Blanco co-founded Kinection Dance Project with partner/co-founder Cesar Garfiaz. Born out of their love and strength for performing and teaching partnering work – Kinection Dance Project explores the human connection both physically and metaphorically. Its concentration is on duets, each showcasing and exploring a different aspect of ever complicated and beautiful relationships. As a movement educator Blanco has created curriculum and taught extensively partnering technique, performance technique, salsa, and modern dance. She has taught in school residencies, choreographed special projects, and taught workshops in schools across the country as well as internationally. She also has a great love for the culinary world and is certified in plant-based nutrition. She teaches cooking classes and gives lectures on the subject of “food be thy medicine.” During her many dance tours the cooking classes and lectures have often been a wonderful holistic addition allowing further connection to the community and body.

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">No debate or public discourse has ever occurred in the House of Commons before, during, or after the ""official"" end of the war in Afghanistan. The conflict continues, and Canadian Special Forces remain there to this day. In light of the fact that more Canadian veterans of the Afghan war have died by suicide than were killed in combat, there is an appetite growing in Canada to acknowledge the long-term effect this war is having on Canadian soldiers and their families. The majority of the Taliban who fight Canadians in Afghanistan come from Pakistan. The accelerated resettlement of Afghans to Canada - with little resources provided to address the trauma of living through decades of war - can create a toxic blend of isolation and mental illness that foils the hopes of all involved. <i>The Road to Paradise</i> is a triptych of stories that examines the long-reaching consequences of a single act of violence, and exposes the lethal thread that snakes its way through the fabric of households, continents apart. </span><br/>

""A child suicide bomber in Pakistan, a Canadian soldier in Kandahar, an Afghan immigrant in Toronto. Three worlds collide
 in this play about love and loss in the time of war."" 

The Road to Paradise was created in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Canada and features actors from each country. Based on interviews conducted with families of the Canadian Armed Forces, the Pakistan Army, the Afghan National Army,  and the Taliban, The Road to Paradise examines the impact of war on women and children.  This show will also mark the Canadian debut of actress Parwin Mushtael. After years of death threats due to her work as an actress in Afghanistan, she fled to Canada with her family after her husband was murdered at their home in Kabul. The Road to Paradise includes her true story, told by her, in all its rawness.A Human Cargo production presented by Crow's Theatre in association with  Buddies in Bad Times Theatre, The Road to Paradise is presented in English and Dari with a cast of Canadian, Afghan and Pakistani actors. Surtitles will translate all Dari dialogue into English.Following the world premiere at Buddies in Bad Times Theatre, the production will be touring to:Agha Khan Museum – Dec 2, 2015 at 8pmAnd to Canadian Forces Base Petawawa on December 5th, 2015 for a special 
performance for military families.
 


Who are we?
Human Cargo is dedicated to the creation of theatre that explores the extremes of the human condition. It’s our goal to bring new voices to the world stage, offer diverse perspectives of the human condition and celebrate our evolving Canadian identity.
We collaborate with theatre artists and companies in Canada, and around the world, to create our work. We develop our plays over long periods of time, in the countries and communities where the play is set. We then present these multi-lingual productions, with international casts, both in Canada and the plays' countries of origin.
We strive to create innovative, theatrical experiences that will inspire audiences to re-evaluate their personal and global perspectives of the human condition. We provide a safe environment for audiences to engage in a thorough and thought-provoking discussion of ideas. We implement a touring/presentation model that reaches out to a new generation of viewing public and embraces the diverse make-up of our ever-changing society.

No debate or public discourse has ever occurred in the House of Commons before, during, or after the ""official"" end of the war in Afghanistan. The conflict continues, and Canadian Special Forces remain there to this day. In light of the fact that more Canadian veterans of the Afghan war have died by suicide than were killed in combat, there is an appetite growing in Canada to acknowledge the long-term effect this war is having on Canadian soldiers and their families. The majority of the Taliban who fight Canadians in Afghanistan come from Pakistan. The accelerated resettlement of Afghans to Canada - with little resources provided to address the trauma of living through decades of war - can create a toxic blend of isolation and mental illness that foils the hopes of all involved. The Road to Paradise is a triptych of stories that examines the long-reaching consequences of a single act of violence, and exposes the lethal thread that snakes its way through the fabric of households, continents apart.

On les a connus adultes, on les découvrira à chaque âge de leur vie, jusqu’à l’enfance…Avec émotion et humour, Gaétan Borg (Mamma Mia) et Stéphane Laporte (Le Roi Lion) nous guident dans ce jeu de piste à travers les années. C’est l’élégante musique de Stéphane Corbin (L’Hôtel des Roches Noires) qui tourne chaque page d’un nouveau 31, avec les chansons des Funambules.Sous la houlette de Jean-Luc Revol (Le Cabaret des Hommes perdus), quatre talents reconnus du théâtre musical :Stéphane : Rachel Pignot (Un Violon sur le Toit)Victoire : Valérie Zaccomer (Frankenstein Junior)Anthony : Alexandre Faitrouni (La Belle et la Bête)Ruben : Fabian Richard (Cabaret)

<div>THE SHOW:

<p>Visionary theatre artist <b>Lisa Wolpe</b>’s new solo
show <i>Shakespeare and the Alchemy of Gender</i> offers a unique
celebration of the enchanting power of cross-gender Shakespeare. Over the past
20 years of work with the Los Angeles Women’s Shakespeare Company, Ms. Wolpe
has played more of the Bard’s male roles than any woman in history, always to
superlative reviews. An activist as well as a celebrated actress and director,
Wolpe’s work speaks toward liberation from the “gender box” of expectations,
and offers a unique and powerful perspective of courage, resilience and hope
against her family’s background of war, suicide and despair.</p>
<p><i>Shakespeare and the Alchemy of Gender</i> played
in London last summer for a two-week run at the historic Rose Playhouse. She has
played it in various iterations at: Provincetown Women’s Theater Festival, Los
Angeles (Whittier College, The Miles Playhouse, Skylight Theater, UCLA),
SpringWorks Festival, Stratford Ontario; Vancouver, B.C.; Chicago, Hope
College, MI, Richmond Shakespeare Company, Colorado Shakespeare Festival,
San Francisco Shakespeare Festival, Shakespeare’s Birthplace,
Stratford-Upon-Avon, U.K.; The Rose Playhouse, U.K.; Orlando

<p>“<b>Lisa Wolpe</b> is her own woman and joyfully speaks her

Fresh off an international tour, I bring my dynamic solo show to New York City. Shakespeare and the Alchemy of Gender is a very profound and personal piece, in which I play bits of Hamlet, Richard III, Shylock, and engage the audience in a profound discussion about suicide, empathy, family, forgiveness, and the transformational powers of Imagination, Memory, and Love. I’ve been touring it from Vancouver to London and throughout the USA to 5-star reviews – deceptively simple, a lifetime of work packed into an hour.

victimization and provides a glimpse of the resilience, hope and humanity that
makes a life worth living. She’s equally adept at telling her own story and the
many tales told together result in an engaging, heartrending, satisfying time
in the theatre.”

<p>Dublin Rising is a new musical by Krishna Alexandra and Lórien Patton. It is an original story about the everyday women involved in the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin, Ireland, which paved the way for Irish independence in 1921.</p>
<p>The musical debuted in Las Vegas on December 10, 2015 in a concert performance at the Paul Harris Theatre, and we are now planning to continue development with two stagings: (1) a small workshop production on April 22 and 23, 2016, to correspond to the 100-year anniversary of the Rising; and (2) a more complete staging to be held on July 1 and 2. (All currently scheduled performances to be held in Las Vegas.)</p>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Dublin Rising tells the stories of three women from vastly different socio-economic backgrounds, whose lives are upended by the one-week Easter Rebellion.</p>
<p>Nellie is the owner of a Dublin brothel, and the head of an underground spy network. She allows her place of business to be used as a meeting place for a small rebel unit, under the leadership of a female commander, Josephine Moore.</p>
<p>Brigid, an educated middle-class woman and the wife of an Irish officer, supports the revolution financially and writes for an Irish Nationalist newspaper.</p>
<p>Meaghann is an unwed teenage mother who has been condemned to a cloistered life under the supervision of nuns. Her brother fights in the revolution, and promises to free her someday. These three women’s lives will be forever changed by the events of Easter Week 1916. </p>
<h3>About the Show</h3>
<p>With the upcoming 100th anniversary of the Irish 1916 Easter Rising, a great deal of attention has been fo- cussed on the few men and exceedingly rare women generally thought of as the leaders and heroes of the Rebellion. Little attention has been paid to the contribution of women outside of ‘accepted’ roles: brave nurses, loving wives, and mothers of the next generation of patriots. The truth is that women served not only in leadership, but at all levels of the Rising: from finance and logistics, to intelligence gathering, to physical combat.</p>
<p>With this heavily researched piece of historical fiction, we wanted to show the contributions and experiences of women in Dublin during that pivotal week. In addressing that broad range of experience, they also wanted to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the closing of the last Irish Magdalene Laundry, a harsh Catholic institution for the confinement of ‘wayward’ and rebellious women and girls. </p>
<p>The production will also include a significant filmic projection component, consisting of original illustrations, animations, and historical footage from the Rising.</p>

<h3><b>Why Our Show Matters</b></h3>
<p>Women have been written out of history, out of literature, out of popular entertainment, and out of theatre. For untold millennia, the cultural contributions of women have been either discounted or appropriated by men of power, and the preservation of the patriarchal social order has been prioritized at the cost of history, culture and truth. In the theatre, we have denied women agency, funding and opportunities at every turn, at great harm to the art form. The cultural suppression of women in the theatre has had a profound impact on the body of litera- ture studied, performed, and produced today.</p>
<p>My mission as an artist is to bring women’s stories to the forefront of the theatre. If I were to write nothing but women’s stories for the rest of my life, I could barely make a dent in the gender imbalance in theatre today, but every story I tell brings another woman out of the shadows, and helps to bring a bit more female representa- tion into the communal, cultural memory we share.</p>
<p>Communal, cultural memory is primarily defined not by the memories of living people, but by the stories and histories that narrate our memories of the past. The idea of cultural memory as a living process, rather than a static artifact, requires that we view the creation of cultural memory as active and mutable. Further, it requires that we, as citizens, artists, and historians, take some responsibility for the cultural memory that we are even now writing.</p>
<p>As theatre professionals, this responsibility is particularly profound, because theatre has always played an important role in this ongoing construction of history. If our communal, cultural memory is defined by the stories that we choose to tell, and the stories we choose to preserve, than we, as a theatre community, have some very difficult questions to face about the imbalance in gender representation in positions of creative power in the pro- fessional theatre. In the theatre world, women’s stories are often relegated to the same place as women’s studies are in academic circles: a dusty corner, not considered relevant to the general population. This shallow charac- terization of the experiences of fully half of humanity as being secondary or periphery to the core of academic study, or dramatic expression, is short-sighted and damaging to our cultural identity and our communal, cultural memory.</p>
<div>
<p>Women’s stories must be prioritized in the theatre, at least until a level of equal representation has finally been achieved. It is not merely a matter of fairness or opportunity. It is far more important than that. It is a question of our cultural heritage, and the cultural memory that we are passing on to our descendants. If we continue to write women’s stories out of the primary narrative of history, our culture will continue to fester with inequality and misogyny, and there will be no counter-narrative popular enough to be remembered.</p>
<p>As makers of theatre, we are the recipients of an ancient tradition of storytelling and memory-making. Now, as in every age, it comes to us to decide what kind of culture we are trying to build, and who is invited to participate fully in it.</p>

Strand Theater
Company, dedicated to celebrating women's diverse voices and perspectives, is thrilled to present to Baltimore audiences
a regional premiere of Harry and the Thief by Sigrid Gilmer - an
audacious play about slavery,  sacrifice, revolution, and one of
Maryland's most beloved historical figures - Harriet Tubman. Oh, and it's a
comedy. 
Synopsis: ""Jeremy
has a Ph.D. in physics from Harvard. And a time machine. And a plan. Jeremy's
plan is to send his thieving cousin Mimi back in time to 1863 to find Harriet
Tubman and give her guns. Lots and lots of guns. ""
Directed by Susan
Stroupe.

<i><b>Images</b></i> is a one-woman play about the life of Eva Schloss.  Eva is Anne Frank's step-sister and childhood friend.  The two girls played together frequently before World War II tore their lives apart.  <br/><br/>Just like Anne and her family, Eva's family was captured by the Nazis, while in hiding, and was sent to Auschwitz.  They survived nine torturous months in Auschwitz under the watchful eye of Dr. Mengele.  By the end of the war only Eva and her mother would survive --- her father and brother perished following the forced march to Mauthausen.<br/><br/>The play tells the story of Eva's life, in retrospect with Eva in her eighties, via her recollections of events and video segments of recreations of important moments and family photos.  But it doesn't stop there.  It follows Eva's life after her release from Auschwitz and the wonderful work she has done up to the present day.  Eva has made it her mission in life to tell her story to the world in the hopes of helping people to understand the dangers of prejudice and discrimination.  She talks to groups of adults and children all over the world with the ultimate hope of educating people so that another Holocaust will never take place.  Her favorite groups to speak to are school children since she feels that they are the future caretakers of the world.<br/><br/>The play uses a professional actress in the role of Eva Schloss and following the premier production in Youngstown, Ohio, in August of 2016, the intent is to take the show on tour to other theater venues as well as many schools.  Eva is now in her late eighties and when the time arrives that she will no longer be able to travel, this play can help to fill that gap so that her story can live on and can continue to educate.<br/><br/>The world premier will take place at the Youngstown Playhouse and they are 100% on board with the project.  Their assistance and support has helped immensely to bring us this far.  We feel that the subsequent tour is very important in that it will help to supplement Holocaust education in many schools.  More and more schools are beginning to incorporate Holocaust education into their curriculums.  This show could be a valuable asset in many schools.<br/><br/>The funds we hope to raise will help to defray production costs for the world premier production, in August of 2016, which include the few  props needed plus video and editing costs.  They will also help with some promotion and advertising, although much of that will be done with the help of the Playhouse as well as online via two websites and social media.  These funds will also give us a boost toward the purchase of equipment to be used on tour; such as a computer and a video projector.  But the funding we are looking at right now is more crucial to getting the show off the ground in August so it can then move forward for a tour beginning in 2017.<br/><br/>Eva is in full support of this project and has authorized the script being used.  Eva, who lives in London, hopes to be present for the world premier in August of 2016. <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>This is only initial funding to help get the world premier production off the ground in August, 2016.  The unique thing about this production is that it is not a big budget show.  The impact is in the content of the actress on stage and the accompanying videos.  Set and props are intentionally kept to a minimum.  This initial funding will help to get things going with the production.  The ultimate goal for the show is to take it on tour, beginning in 2017, to schools and other theater venues in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.  After that tour we then hope to increase the range of the tour.<br/>What your contributions can achieve for you is described in the Perks section.  But beyond those Perks you will get the satisfaction that you helped to make this project a reality and you also had a hand in the increase in necessary Holocaust education, not only for students, but for people of all ages.  <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>More and more schools are adding Holocaust education into their classrooms.  We are on the verge of losing all of our Holocaust survivors as most of them are now in their 80s and 90s.  Once they are gone, their stories go with them.  It is up to us to continue their stories and keep the education of what happened during the Holocaust alive.  We must pick up the gauntlet and keep this information available for all to see and hear.  That is what this show will help to do.  Eva travels the world telling her story but when the time comes that she can no longer do that, this show will be there to help fill that void.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>Any time you do a show about the Holocaust, and I have done several including a previous one about Eva, you run the risk of people thinking that it will be sad and depressing. But hearing Eva's story is anything but that. Sure there are sad moments but Eva's story is very uplifting due to her outlook and determination. She survived the worst Nazi death camp and has used her experiences to educate the world.<br/><br/>We intend to emphasize the positive side of her story, and the play, in all of our promotion and advertising. Hearing her story is a positive experience that everyone remembers after hearing it. We have great hopes for the school tour since the Holocaust has seen such a resurgence in the curriculum of many schools across the country.<br/><br/>We will also supplement all performances, but especially the school ones, with a question and answer session following the show so that students can learn more about what they have just seen. There are also plans to offer a study guide so that teachers can then go back to the classroom following the performance and use it along with their other Holocaust study materials.<br/><br/>Another danger with Holocaust material in a show stems from the fact that some people feel that nothing more needs to be said about the Holocaust --- ""we know all about that."" But judging from recent history, we apparently don't know enough --- because similar things continue to happen. It is our responsibility to keep stories about the Holocaust out there not only to help deter re-occurances but also as a way to honor all of those people who suffered through it, particularly the millions that were murdered. Holocaust survivors are dying at an alarming rate --- we have to continue to tell their stories.<br/><br/>The Holocaust has been an interest of mine since I directed my first production of ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" more than 30 years ago. I have gone on to write several successful and powerful plays about the Holocaust.<br/><br/>We look forward to you being a part of this very important project.<br/>

<h3>What is it? </h3>
<p>People of the Eye is an autobiographical piece of theatre based on writer/performer Erin Siobhan Hutching's family experiences growing up with a deaf family member. The Deaf &amp; Hearing Ensemble are looking for help to take the show to the Edinburgh Fringe, to share it with an international fringe-going audience including influential programmers, reviewers and importantly, the Deaf community who may not be able to access many of the shows at the Fringe Festival. In line with our commitment to outreach and developing young artists, we will be running workshops alongside the performances which are open to all, Deaf and hearing, for free. </p>
<p><i><strong>“Of course, you shouldn’t use ‘sign language’.”</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>Inspired by real events, this personal story follows a family finding their way through unfamiliar territory to discover their own voice. A story about parents, about sisters, and about the complex love that binds families together.</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>Using a mix of video projections, sound, live performance, and creative accessibility, this unique performance is about memories, feelings of isolation, and finding the joy in difference.</strong></i></p>
<p>People of the Eye has been developed with The Deaf &amp; Hearing Ensemble, in particular with director Jennifer K Bates and deaf actresses Sophie Stone and Emily Howlett, across the last 2 years, with each artist contributing personal experiences and developing a deep connection to the project. </p>
<p>The piece has just finished an Arts Council England supported run at London's Yard Theatre, selected from over 200 applications to be part of their NOW'16 festival, with mentorship and in a double bill with Forest Fringe Co-Artistic Director Ira Brand. It has now been chosen to be part of the acclaimed Northern Stage progam at Summerhall at the Edinburgh Fringe. This is a clear indication of the potential of this project, and the excitement generated in the Arts and Deaf communities about it. </p>
<p><i>""An arresting, immersive and startlingly original piece of theatre. A beautiful, tightly choreographed spectacle...something very special indeed."" A Younger Theatre</i></p>
<p><i>""The love between the two characters is palpable and you leave the piece warmed by it while questioning why society is so fussed about difference."" Huffington Post</i></p>
<p>The Deaf &amp; Hearing Ensemble has just received a Research &amp; Development grant for a new show from The Samuel Beckett Theatre Trust and the Barbican, indicating the quality of our work, and the need for it. </p>
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>Erin Siobhan Hutching (writer/performer), <span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Emily Howlett (deviser/performer)</span>, Jennifer K. Bates (director), Sophie Stone (deviser), Samuel Dore (videographer), Emma Houston (sound designer), Myriddin Wannell (designer), Oliver Savidge (lighting designer), Rachel Sampley (technical manager), David Monteith-Hodge (photography and promotional videos), Nadia Nadarajah (movement/outside eye) Emily Salter (intern), Rachael Merry (intern), </p>
<p>We won't all be going to Edinburgh but we have all put our love and talent into this project!</p>
<h3>Why does it matter?</h3>
<p>The Ensemble is so passionate about this project and about telling this story, which will resonate with anyone who has experienced being different, the ""odd one out"" for any reason, and for the people who care for and about them. You could be forgiven for thinking the world is becoming a less tolerant place. Please help us take this honest, joyful, poignant show to the largest theatre festival in the world, and change some perspectives!</p>
<p>Being programmed in such a respected theatre venue will begin to pave the way for other accessible work being part of mainstream theatre programming, to allow D/deaf audiences the access they deserve. We are not a community or outreach theatre group (although we applaud these groups) we are professional artists making high quality, innovative theatre we believe in. </p>
<p>We are also passionate about providing opportunities for training for D/deaf young people, who often experience barriers to access when they audition for Drama Schools and other forms of training. We will be running workshops in London (at Southwark Playhouse) for young people and in Edinburgh (with Fringe Central) for all ages to allow D/deaf and hearing people the opportunity to work together in a creative environment. These will be free to attend. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>Facilitator fees to run our workshops - £500</li>
<li>Communication Support Workers to assist at our workshops - £500</li>

</ul>
<p>We are fortunate enough to have received support from Northern Stage, Boshier Hinton Foundation and Birkdale Trust for the Hearing Impaired to cover the majority of the costs of running the workshops and performing at the festival. We need this bit extra to ensure our artists can be properly paid and everything is accessible. If we do not reach our entire goal, we will prioritise our workshops, production and accessibility costs to ensure that the show can go on! Rest assured that we have set a flexible goal because we are determined to ensure this project goes ahead, so your money will go to very good use.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Taking a show to the Edinburgh Fringe is a risky prospect. We have raised enough support, financial and in kind, to make this less risky than most shows going up. We are at one of the best venues, with a company (Northern Stage) which has a strong reputation who have chosen us to be part of their press day, ensuring we will have reviews before other shows. They will be providing volunteers to help promote our show as well as a fantastic PR company, both essential tools for getting audiences in at the Fringe.</p>
<p>With the current movement towards recognising the importance of diversity and accessibility, with #ActForChange, Sick of the Fringe, Unlimited and other initiatives, we are well placed for people to be interested in seeing our work. </p>
<p>With the faith placed in us by organisations like Northern Stage, The Yard, The Barbican, The RSC, The Roundhouse and more, we have a strong track record. </p>
<p>We are in a strong position to do well at the Fringe, with a little luck! With your investment, we can ensure the product that we present is as good as it can be. </p>

Risks & Challenges
Taking a show to the Edinburgh Fringe is a risky prospect. We have raised enough support, financial and in kind, to make this less risky than most shows going up. We are at one of the best venues, with a company (Northern Stage) which has a strong reputation who have chosen us to be part of their press day, ensuring we will have reviews before other shows. They will be providing volunteers to help promote our show as well as a fantastic PR company, both essential tools for getting audiences in at the Fringe.
With the current movement towards recognising the importance of diversity and accessibility, with #ActForChange, Sick of the Fringe, Unlimited and other initiatives, we are well placed for people to be interested in seeing our work. 
With the faith placed in us by organisations like Northern Stage, The Yard, The Barbican, The RSC, The Roundhouse and more, we have a strong track record. 
We are in a strong position to do well at the Fringe, with a little luck! With your investment, we can ensure the product that we present is as good as it can be.

Late one night, while posting a dating video, she receives an unexpected response from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Shackleton"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sir Ernest Shackleton</a> (1874-1922), who is stranded on an iceberg near the South Pole. Inspired by her music, he shares his heroic Antarctic journey with her in video and song (including actual video footage and photos from Shackleton’s 1917 Antarctic expedition). Against all odds, they discover that their greatest inspiration lies within each other.</p><p>Help us reach our destination! If you contribute, you’ll be a part of the journey!

Ernest Shackleton Loves Me is scheduled to officially open on May 7th and run through June 11th at the Tony Kiser Theater at Second Stage. The cast is rehearsing; the ad agency is strategizing; the marketing machine is moving; the tickets are selling! Previews begin April 14th. We'd love for you to join our team!We feel fortunate that we hopped on-board The Tony Kiser Theater, as this venue has launched many successful projects onto Broadway, such as Dear Evan Hansen, Next to Normal, and the 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee. Who knows where our ship will sail after this… “I believe it is in our nature to explore, to reach out into the unknown. The only true failure would be not to explore at all.” - Sir Ernest ShackletonExploring the world of theater has been in my nature since I was young and opening a show in New York City has been a dream of mine for as long as I can remember. From 2001-2008, I was founder and Producing Artistic Director of Capitol Hill Arts Center in Seattle. And for the past eight years, I have produced the legendary Black Rock City pop-up restaurant Sacred Cow. And although I have produced over 15 world premiere plays in the past, Ernest Shackleton Loves Me will be my New York City theater debut. When that curtain opens on opening night, a dream of mine will be realized. You can be part of that excitement!OK, so here’s what the show is all about: Ernest Shackleton Loves Me tells the story of a sleep-deprived single mom who struggles to balance her family and career as a video game music composer. Late one night, while posting a dating video, she receives an unexpected response from Sir Ernest Shackleton (1874-1922), who is stranded on an iceberg near the South Pole. Inspired by her music, he shares his heroic Antarctic journey with her in video and song (including actual video footage and photos from Shackleton’s 1917 Antarctic expedition). Against all odds, they discover that their greatest inspiration lies within each other.Help us reach our destination! If you contribute, you’ll be a part of the journey! You may be able to visit the set, join the opening night party or host your own party out of town featuring a video recording of the show!One of our crew has custom designed a special brass expedition pendant for this NYC journey. The pendent is water-jet cut and features a sextant on a field of mountains. One arm of the sextant has the tuning pegs of a violin. See ""perks"" to get yours shipped in time for Opening Night. “By endurance we conquer” - Sir Ernest ShackletonErnest Shackleton Loves Me has endured. We’ve had full productions at the Seattle Repertory Theatre in April and May of 2014. And at George Street Playhouse in New Jersey in April and May of 2015. And at the Paramount at Arts Emerson in Boston in September and October of 2015.We now are entering the rehearsal room: And THE CRITICS LOVE US:“An intrepid new musical. Exhilarating.” --New York Times (from our New Jersey show)“Antartica has never seemed so warm.

She has toured the world with Cyndi Lauper, Joe Jackson and the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, and is now spreading her wings as a soloist, with her live-looping multimedia release Just Getting Good (inspired by the technology used in Ernest Shackleton Loves Me). She is the co-writer of many songs for Disney, as well as the scores for ten stage musicals.And the courageous and charismatic Wade McCollum: Wade originated the role of Ernest Shackleton at the Seattle Rep and went on to play Shackleton at George Street Playhouse and most recently in Boston at the Paramount/Arts Emerson where he won the Norton award for best actor in a musical. Wade has also been seen on Broadway in Wicked, in S.F. in Jersey Boys and also starred in the first national tour of Broadway's Priscilla Queen of the Desert as Tick/Mitzi.Directed by Obie award-winning director Lisa Peterson.New York: The Model Apartment (Primary Stages); Slavs!, Traps and Light Shining in Buckinghamshire (Obie Award), The Waves (two Drama Desk nominations), all at New York Theatre Workshop; The Scarlet Letter (CSC, world premiere).

He was honored in 2007 with a ""Sustained Excellence in Sound Design"" OBIE award and a 2010 Tony Award for Fela!, which subsequently toured the States as well as visiting London, Amsterdam and Lagos.

It is difficult to identify the genre of this theatre's stagings (as the word ""genre"" in itself implies some kind of traditionalism) and perhaps the company's style is closest to modern choreography in its most nonconformist form. The shows tell no story, reveal no plot, have no dimensions, or narrative. Rather, they mirror reality through dreams, bordering on that thin line between the outer and the inner worlds that interacts with the spectator through their own intuition or unconsciousness. As in the 'absolute mirror', every single person should see in each their work, an inner world and their own particular destiny. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/Foe4u2ZCPcJVK/giphy.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>blackSKYwhite has received important awards for innovation in theater at FringeFirst - the international performing arts festival in Edinburgh, Scotland and have headlined performances at Glastronbury Festival.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Why Are We Raising Money?</strong></p><p>Inviting blackSKYwhite to take part in Burning Man 2017 is the most amazing gift that we can give to the playa, but it is not without difficulty.

We believe that their work will offer a revolutionary uniqueness and beautifully complement Burning Man 2017's theme: Radical Ritual.Burning Man 2017 attendees will be able to witness blackSKYwhite at the Dust Circus camp on the playa - free of charge, liberating of mind, and welcome to all! About blackSKYwhiteThe concept of blackSKYwhite is based on creating new forms of interaction between the inner and outer world of the character.  ""Radical"", ""Progressive"", ""Nontraditional"", ""Cultist"", ""Stylish"" - these are just some of the epithets received by this unique Russian theatre which has invariably stood out since its inception in 1988, having since performed their inimitable work all over the globe. BlackSKYwhite's performances are magical sights - incorporating computer graphics and the organic actor's bodily movements, music reaching from electronics to cabaret and ethnic style as well as stunning lighting effects which create a surreal world of great illusion, yet at the same time, a world that is very close and true.blackSKYwhite have created, and continue to create a special technique of placing actors on the edge between reality and illusion - where performances are more of a dream than anything resembling real life. It is difficult to identify the genre of this theatre's stagings (as the word ""genre"" in itself implies some kind of traditionalism) and perhaps the company's style is closest to modern choreography in its most nonconformist form. The shows tell no story, reveal no plot, have no dimensions, or narrative. Rather, they mirror reality through dreams, bordering on that thin line between the outer and the inner worlds that interacts with the spectator through their own intuition or unconsciousness. As in the 'absolute mirror', every single person should see in each their work, an inner world and their own particular destiny. blackSKYwhite has received important awards for innovation in theater at FringeFirst - the international performing arts festival in Edinburgh, Scotland and have headlined performances at Glastronbury Festival. Why Are We Raising Money?Inviting blackSKYwhite to take part in Burning Man 2017 is the most amazing gift that we can give to the playa, but it is not without difficulty. The theater resides in and performs in Moscow, Russia - a long way to go for three humans and dozens of characters. We are handling their visas, invitations, airfare, tickets to the Burn, lodging, production logistics, and hosting them through their entire trip to the United States to spread amazingness and wonder.We are raising money to cover the physical costs of their travel (airfare, et al), costume and prop shipping, planning for their playa survival and accommodations, as well as setting up an indoor and outdoor stage on the playa so that their art can be enjoyed by all.Simply-put, the more we raise, the better we can make the experience - more lights, more effects, and they can bring more costumes and props!In addition to their appearance at Burning Man 2017, we are looking to arrange three special events in Mountain View in September - stay tuned!  Of course, sometimes Dmitry and Marcella appear in default forms too.... Dust Circus - Burning Man CampDust Circus is honored to bring blackSKYwhite to the playa at Burning Man 2017.

<p>Hi my name is Ashley Robicheaux, or<i> Robi</i>, and I am a performer, choreographer, and movement director. Over the past six years I have been choreographing new works and collaborating with artists in other mediums.  As previous performer in several immersive works, including Punchdrunk’s <i>Sleep No More</i>, Third Rail Project’s <i>“The Grand Paradise”</i> (originating cast member), and Emily Terndrup and Derrick Belcham’s <i>“FABLE”</i>, my experience as a performer has been largely immersive over the past 3 years. Aside from performing in immersive pieces, I have also been creating my own work and collaborating with other artists in a variety of environments including live music performances, installations, music videos and short films, as well as the for the proscenium stage. I am thrilled to be creating <i>Mattress</i>, both the largest-scale and most process-oriented work that I have directed thus far.</p>
<p><strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>PREMISE:</strong></p>
<p>The basic premise of <i>Mattress</i> is the abstraction of the human experience within a dreamscape through both physical and visual mediums. Our process will culminate into a week of immersive dance-theater performances as well as a short film following the characters we have developed.  We will be holding monthly work in progress showings at The Hollows Artspace in Williamsburg from February to June of 2017, where we will invite our audience to be part of our process and give feedback. In addition to these monthly showings, we will be creating an installation of this work at The Hollows in April.  Finally, in the fall of 2017, we plan to present a large-scale version of this work.  Because of the multiple forms this work will take on, we believe <i>Mattress</i> will reach a wide range of audiences that extends beyond the dance community. </p>
<p><strong>COLLABORATORS:</strong></p>
<p>Several members of the <i>Mattress</i> team have been working together for a number of years, developing a language and a world that is universal yet unique in it's character. Additionally, we have brought on several other incomparable collaborators of different mediums. Robi is fueled by the multidisciplinary aspect of this work, and has curated a “dream team” of artists that she trusts from different aspects of her creative community. Alongside this, the written source material of <i>Mattress</i> is derived from one author’s writing, Eric Stiefel.  Through the creative process each artist has taken Eric’s work and personally navigated it through movement and theatricality to portray their own human experience through his poetic framework. In this way we are developing honest personal narratives through this piece by working off of a concentrated body of text.  We think of the poem as a vessel for self discovery, and the entire work as a vessel for our audience to  go on parallel journey of self realizations. </p>

<p>We have been searching for a long time for a space to develop this work and call our “home”, as the logistical aspects of the creation <i>Mattress</i> simply do not pair well with public studio space in New York City. We have just begun our residency at The Hollows Art Space, and we need the funding to make the work come to life. Our plan is to premiere an installation version of<i> Mattress</i> at Hollows in April, and perform it in the fall of 2017 as a large-scale immersive piece. We are committed to a weekly rehearsal process that will culminate into an inclusive experience for our audience members. </p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOUR CONTRIBUTION MEANS TO US:</strong></p>
<p>Your contribution will help us create a journey that we have been developing for the past 10 months, a journey which involves our audience members and outlasts what could otherwise be a short-lived proscenium presentation. The funds we receive mean more to us than being able to produce a product, but to create a journey for ourselves and our audience to take part, in a time when it is imperative to be making and viewing meaningful work. </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>BUDGET OVERVIEW:</strong></p>
<p>We are asking for $29,730.00 to support the remainder of our creative process and produce a 6-8 night run of the immersive dance-theater performance. The components of our budget include:</p>
<p>Dancer payment for rehearsal and performances</p>
<p>Stipends for our collaborators (writer, visual artist, composer and live musicians) </p>
<p>Costumes and Set </p>
<p>Mattresses</p>

<p>Insurance</p>
<p>In exchange for your support, we are offering perks ranging from a shout-out on social media, to free tickets to our performances and a sit down dinner with the cast and creatives of the <i>Mattress</i> team.  If we do not reach our entire goal, the funds we do receive will be dispersed to the artists who have given their time to create this work thus far, and as a reimbursement for the cost of space out of pocket.  In addition, we will perform <i>Mattress</i> in whatever capacity we are able to afford as a work in progress. It is important to myself and the rest of the creative that have generously given their time over the past 10 months that we follow through with this work in whatever way we can. </p>
<p><b>RISKS AND CHALLENGES:</b></p>
</div><div>
<p>It is impossible to ignore the fact that in building any piece of choreography, that there will be challenges we have to face in our process. The Mattress in particular may prove itself to be logistically challenging. However, my experience as a choreographer and performer having worked in a range of different environments and under different constraints as well as the inspiring versatility of the dancers and other collaborators, we are confident we will be able to overcome any (most) hurdles we may come across. I have an understanding of the workflow, conflicts, and intensity that come with building immersive work and am ready for the challenge- a challenge that my peers support me in. </p>
<p>We have planned to perform the piece for a number of test-audiences to help us overcome any road blocks we may encounter. We also trust that our showing + feedback sessions at the Hollows will give us valuable insight into how to make the piece the most effective. </p>

<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>We are in the process of creating a new work based upon research of marriage and relationships. Our artistic director, Evelyn Joy Hoelscher, recently married and was inspired to create a piece on her reflection of the vulnerability, playfulness and sacrificial love that this committed relationship requires. Society often portrays marriage through a distorted lens, but marriage is not meant to simply be between two persons; it is also a partnership between God AND your community. As artists we dive into a discovery of the lens of vulnerability, playfulness, and sacrificial love in relation to these partnerships within a marriage.</p>
<h2><strong>The Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>Ticket sales from performances generally go directly to cover the cost of the space or to the person producing the show.

<h3>The Next Great Chicago Play</h3>
<p>This city is full of some of the most talented playwrights in the country, but it has far too few development opportunities for them. One of the biggest obstacles standing between our playwrights and the next great Chicago play is the lack of time and support they need to write it. Unlike other theatre artists, playwrights do most of their work without any guarantee they'll be paid for it. Playwrights often spend years working on a play, unsure if they'll ever be paid for their work.</p>
<p><strong>Step Up Chicago Playwrights</strong> is ready to play a lead role in supporting Chicago playwrights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our <strong>Neighborhood Residency</strong> program connects experienced playwrights with one of Chicago's vibrant neighborhoods, supporting an exchange of knowledge and skills between artist and neighbors.</li>
<li>Part of that exchange will be a <strong>Chi Wrights</strong> class or workshop, in which the Resident Playwright shares their knowledge and expertise with then next generation of Chicago playwrights.</li>
<li>Finally, playwrights who have completed a residency will be able to apply for a <strong>Chicago Works Commission</strong>, which gives them the time and support they need to translate what they learned from the residency into the next great Chicago play</li>
</ul>
<p>We're ready to play our part in supporting Chicago's playwrights. But we can't do it without <u>you</u> playing a part, too!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Play Your Part</h3>
<p>Because we're focused entirely on the development of new plays, every dollar you donate goes toward supporting Chicago playwrights. Your donation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pays the playwright for their time and labor</li>
<li>Pays for printing scripts</li>
<li>Pays for paper clips, pens, pencils, and other supplies</li>
<li>Pays actors and directors so that the playwright can hear their work</li>
<li>Pays dramaturgs to give extra feedback and guidance during development</li>
<li>Pays ASL interpreters to make sure Deaf artists and participants are included</li>
<li>Allows us to offer our Chi Wrights classes free of charge for our neighbors</li>
</ul>
<p>... and more! Your donations, no matter how large, allow us to support Chicago playwrights as they create new plays and tell new stories about our city. <u>You</u> will be instrumental in helping the next great Chicago play take shape. And when the World Premiere of that great Chicago play appears onstage, you'll know that it was your support that helped get it there.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Good Neighbors</h3>
<p>Your donation supports more than a play. Our vision is a community of Chicago theatre artists and audiences that look and sound like <u>all</u> of Chicago. By supporting Step Up's work, you're helping to make that vision a reality.</p>
<p>Every donation helps, and we're offering several perks to show our appreciation for your support.</p>

<li>A donation of $30 (the price of a theatre ticket) helps; we'll be sure to let social media know how much we appreciate it!</li>
<li>For those who can give at the $100 level or above, we'll be recognizing you as a <strong>Good Neighbor</strong>: your name will be listed on our website and you'll have early and exclusive access to events and news throughout the year.</li>
<li>Those who can fully fund our workshops and residencies will be <strong>honored</strong> at events and on our website, as well as given <strong>behind the scenes access</strong> to the play development process.</li>
</ol>
<p>We'll be rolling out new perks and giving levels as the campaign goes on. Check back for updates and limited offers!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>More Impact, Less Revenue</h3>
<p>Focusing exclusively on developing plays (and not producing them) means that Step Up Chicago Playwrights can more flexibly and effectively support playwrights and their development processes. It also means we can no longer depend upon ticket revenue. More than ever, Step Up is counting on donations from people like you. Things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our model is <strong>scalable and adaptable</strong>. For example: we're hoping to offer 2-3 residencies this year, but can increase that number based on fundraising.</li>
<li>This is a <strong>Flexible Funding </strong>campaign, meaning every dollar helps us whether we meet our goal or not.</li>
<li>Step Up Chicago Playwrights is a <strong>501(c)3 nonprofit</strong>, which means your donation might be tax deductible.</li>

<p>Written and directed by Tingying Ma, <strong><i>Future Host: A Speech Opera</i></strong> premieres on <a href=""http://knockdown.center/event/future-host/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Jan 20 - 22, 2017</strong> at <strong>Knockdown Center,</strong></a> New York.</p>
<h3>The Production</h3>
<p>First conceived as a stage play in 2014, <strong><a href=""http://futurehost.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Future Host</i></a> </strong>has gone through many evolutions before crystallizing in its current form of ""Speech Opera"" combining digitally spatialized voice performance and original live music. In the summer of 2016, we rehearsed intensively with an ensemble of 19 actors and completed our studio recording at <a href=""http://atomicsoundnyc.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Atomic Sound</a> this fall. Our momentum was fortified by a work-in-progress performance at ""Performancy Forum: speculative (de)structures"" at <a href=""http://www.performancyforum.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Panoply Performance Laboratory<strong> </strong></a>on September 29, 2016, where we shared a night of intimate collective envisioning of the future with an audience.<i> </i>On<i> </i><strong>February 13 - 14, 2017</strong>, <i>Future Host </i>is traveling to Yokohama, Japan to perform at <strong><a href=""https://www.tpam.or.jp/2017"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TPAM Performance Art Meeting in Yokohama</a></strong>. It is with the generosity and dedication of many people that we are able to bring the future closer and closer to you, and to all of us.We need your help to take further steps so that Future Host could finally meet you.</p>
<p>For our <strong>January premiere at Knockdown Center</strong>, we are hoping to raise <strong>$8800 </strong>to accomplish the 14-channel speech opera with original music score. Your contribution will go directly to honoring the work of boundary-pushing artists and collaborators ($3800), as well as equipment rental, professional sound recording and processing, technical support and production logistics ($4500) that ensure a high quality theatrical experience for the audience. An additional $500 goes to printing a designed bilingual booklet with original manuscript and translation. </p>
<p>If we reach our projected goal, the additional <strong>$3200 </strong>(including $1000 airfare, $1500 equipment rental and sound engineering fee, $500 for accommodation and miscellaneous costs, $330 registration fee and $70 for visa application) you can send us to <strong>Yokohama</strong> in February. </p>
<p><i><a href=""http://knockdown.center/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Knockdown Center </a>supports </i>Future Host<i> with an extensive backline inventory of audio-visual equipment; pre-production, production, and installation staff support; targeted marketing and promotion via its newsletter, social media, and media relationships; and space for the realization of the project. Some projects require additional funding for supplemental material and/or specific technical needs that extend beyond what Knockdown provides, such as the printing of collateral material, custom equipment, travel costs, or when the scope of the project exceeds its original vision or encounters unforeseen costs.</i></p>

<div>
<h3>The Concept</h3>
<p><strong>Future Host </strong>[未来主人] (noun.) is an epithet commonly bestowed to children in officially Socialist states, which posit the youth as the agent, product, and site whereby the future actualizes itself. ""Always already be ready"", so they're told—a command of absolute urgency and ecstatic optimism. The coming shall overcome. In this repetitive cycle of speculation and deferral, time passes, life is left unlived, the here and now unlivable.</p>
<p>Has Future Host come to the future? Will the future find a host? How do we host a future as hostile as the one fast approaching? No matter. On Inauguration Day, Future Host will be crowned with historical insignificance. Theater will be crowned with historical insignificance. But no matter. Future Host is always already ready: to endure the tyranny of political time, to refuse to be taken hostage of the flattened present, to suspend narrative in favor of an average moment of presence.</p>
<p>We come together through Future Host as a moment of our own. We gain strength from a collective human endeavor in theater-making and protest the singularity of the event. We make a monument of fugitive voices that emerge between the void and utmost intimacy. We create space where the minor and the multiple are hosted, literally, by bodies that choose to gather for a period of time.</p>
<p>The where is nowhere else but here, the here is theater that takes place in the future. Come here and be with us. By now. For the future.</p>
</div>
<p>Channeling historical patterns of speaking and speech-making via an original text performed by voice actors in Chinese,<i> Future Host </i>consists of a multitude of voices in the ancient form of chorus. Recorded and mastered through cutting-edge digital technology, fragmented words and unorthodox verbal expressions are composed into a polyphonic soundscape, where the audience move freely in the vast, emptied hall of Knockdown Center. Together with live performance of original music, they form an aleatory, fully sensorial experience beyond the limits of comprehensibility.</p>

Our momentum was fortified by a work-in-progress performance at ""Performancy Forum: speculative (de)structures"" at Panoply Performance Laboratory on September 29, 2016, where we shared a night of intimate collective envisioning of the future with an audience. On February 13 - 14, 2017, Future Host is traveling to Yokohama, Japan to perform at TPAM Performance Art Meeting in Yokohama. It is with the generosity and dedication of many people that we are able to bring the future closer and closer to you, and to all of us.We need your help to take further steps so that Future Host could finally meet you.
For our January premiere at Knockdown Center, we are hoping to raise $8800 to accomplish the 14-channel speech opera with original music score. Your contribution will go directly to honoring the work of boundary-pushing artists and collaborators ($3800), as well as equipment rental, professional sound recording and processing, technical support and production logistics ($4500) that ensure a high quality theatrical experience for the audience. An additional $500 goes to printing a designed bilingual booklet with original manuscript and translation. 
If we reach our projected goal, the additional $3200 (including $1000 airfare, $1500 equipment rental and sound engineering fee, $500 for accommodation and miscellaneous costs, $330 registration fee and $70 for visa application) you can send us to Yokohama in February. 
Knockdown Center supports Future Host with an extensive backline inventory of audio-visual equipment; pre-production, production, and installation staff support; targeted marketing and promotion via its newsletter, social media, and media relationships; and space for the realization of the project. Some projects require additional funding for supplemental material and/or specific technical needs that extend beyond what Knockdown provides, such as the printing of collateral material, custom equipment, travel costs, or when the scope of the project exceeds its original vision or encounters unforeseen costs.

The Concept
Future Host [未来主人] (noun.) is an epithet commonly bestowed to children in officially Socialist states, which posit the youth as the agent, product, and site whereby the future actualizes itself. ""Always already be ready"", so they're told—a command of absolute urgency and ecstatic optimism. The coming shall overcome. In this repetitive cycle of speculation and deferral, time passes, life is left unlived, the here and now unlivable.
Has Future Host come to the future? Will the future find a host? How do we host a future as hostile as the one fast approaching? No matter. On Inauguration Day, Future Host will be crowned with historical insignificance. Theater will be crowned with historical insignificance. But no matter. Future Host is always already ready: to endure the tyranny of political time, to refuse to be taken hostage of the flattened present, to suspend narrative in favor of an average moment of presence.
We come together through Future Host as a moment of our own. We gain strength from a collective human endeavor in theater-making and protest the singularity of the event. We make a monument of fugitive voices that emerge between the void and utmost intimacy. We create space where the minor and the multiple are hosted, literally, by bodies that choose to gather for a period of time.
The where is nowhere else but here, the here is theater that takes place in the future. Come here and be with us. By now. For the future.

Channeling historical patterns of speaking and speech-making via an original text performed by voice actors in Chinese, Future Host consists of a multitude of voices in the ancient form of chorus. Recorded and mastered through cutting-edge digital technology, fragmented words and unorthodox verbal expressions are composed into a polyphonic soundscape, where the audience move freely in the vast, emptied hall of Knockdown Center. Together with live performance of original music, they form an aleatory, fully sensorial experience beyond the limits of comprehensibility.

<p>Greetings! My name is Elizabeth Addison and I am a composer, lyricist, playwright and performer from Boston, Massachusetts. I am also a recovering addict who will be 5 years clean this April. I began writing ""This is Treatment"" after my year long stay at a residential treatment facility. Truthfully, when I started writing ""This is Treatment,"" I had no idea what I was doing. I had never written a song or a play before and the only thing I knew was that if I kept showing up and had a little faith, eventually I would have a musical. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Self Producing 'Treatment'</h3>
<p>In 2014, I decided that it was time to get ""This is Treatment"" on it's feet. Now, I had never produced a show before (are we sensing a pattern?) but something inside me knew that unless I put it up, nobody else would. So, I rented a 100 seat theater at the Dance Complex for two days, found a cast and got it on its feet. The first two shows were completely sold out and over the next three years, the productions would continue to sell out. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1484664973/evx7jpmt97fezbruhi6w.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>No budget, No real set, just a few chairs and tables, but it still resonated with people. Imagine what could happen if we had some real money behind the show?</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In 2015, approximately 20.8 million people age 12 and up had a substance use disorder. In 2015, 1 in 12 people needed treatment, and out of that, only 14% sought Treatment. In 2014, 47,055 people died from from drug overdoses and the numbers are rising rapidly each year... </p>
<p>After each production of ""This is Treatment,"" audience members would email me or comment on how the show made them feel. I heard such things as: this show has a helped repair my relationship with my sister who is a recovering addict, I finally understand what my mother went through, I'm not an addict but I could relate to the feeling of being alone and overwhelmed, I didn't know I needed to see this piece and this show is necessary. I even heard that some people sought a form of treatment as a result of seeing the show. Again, if this is happening when I produce the show, what could happen if it got some real money behind it?</p>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge right now is raising the funds to get to New York. I have never been able to put up more than two shows at a time because of the lack of funds. Producing a show can be very expensive. Also, I am new to the game, unless you are somewhat established, no one is coming from New York to Boston to see your show. You have to bring it to them and in order to do that, I need your help.</p>
<h3>Where does my donation go?</h3>
<p>The costs of bringing ""This is Treatment"" to New York are going to add up quickly. Your donation would go to the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Venue: $1,000</li>

<li>Salaries for 12 cast members, Director, Musical Director,  Assistant Musical Director,  Production Assistant and Stage Manager: $3,200</li>
<li>Travel and Lodging: $2,000</li>
<li>Programs, Marketing, Promotion, etc: $300 </li>
</ul>
<h3>For Me?</h3>
<p>As a thank you for your generous contribution, we have come up with some 'Treatment' perks located to the right of your screen. We want you to know exactly what you are investing in and, like the cast and crew, that you are a part of the 'Treatment' family as well.</p>

<h3>How It All Began</h3>
<p><strong><i>Manar</i></strong> is a play that has been a work in progress with this team for the past year. Melis had written a short version of the play for our class at Columbia University called “Collaboration” overseen by Anne Bogart. The creation of the play was also overseen by Melis’ mentors in the playwriting program including: David Henry Hwang, Lynn Nottage, and Kelly Stuart. After a few months, Melis finished a first draft of the entire script and the team has been working on developing different drafts of the play. Melis is also involved with the Middle East America writers room hosted by the Lark Play Development Center with Mona Mansour, Hadi Tabbal, Leila Buck, and Heather Raffo where she has been developing <i><strong>Manar</strong></i>. We have just started rehearsals for our workshop production going up at LaGuardia Performing Arts Center’s Rough Draft Festival. The Rough Draft Festival is a celebration of artists/organizations and their work under development. The festival features a wide array of artists whose work is at various levels of development. We are so grateful to have the opportunity to showcase our work on <strong><i>Manar</i></strong> and have such a talented group of artists to work with us.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>21/40 is named after the room where we all studied at Iowa state University.</p>
<p>2140 - a small room in Pearson hall - was the only space allotted to our department.  Crowded with a bunch of mismatched chairs and piano that was falling apart, it served as a classroom, a rehearsal hall, and an intimate and resourceful performance venue. Storytelling in such close quarters demanded attention to detail, a lack of artifice, and above all, sincere performances.</p>
<p>Inspired by our time spent in that room, our mission is simple: We strive to tell honest stories. Stories that highlight the joy, the headache, and the ambiguity of real life. In hopes of bringing a new level of sincerity to our shows, we will commit ourselves to ongoing training, a rigorous work ethic, and constant experimentation.</p>
<p>Our first show will be <i>Dead Silence</i>. Written by Taylor Sklenar, a fellow alumnus of ISU, it follows the experiences of Brian, a failing spoken word poet.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Haunted by a recent loss, Brian strives to be the ‘Voice of a generation.” In the wake of his obsession and neglect, his wife struggles to hold their crumbling marriage together. </p>
<p>This script is wonderfully simple. With a flexible set and a cast of only three, the budget necessary is relatively small. A list of production costs include:</p>
<p>A few set pieces, props, costumes, printing (postcards, posters, and programs), and artists stipends.</p>
<p>If you crave poignant storytelling that doesn't condescend to audiences, please consider supporting our mission.</p>
<p>Any additional funds raised will be immediately directed towards our second show: <i>Dog Sees God, Confessions of a Teenage Blockhead</i>. For more information and updates on our upcoming season, please visit our Facebook page:</p>

<p>Isobel Rogers is a writer, songwriter and performer who is Artist-in-Residence at the Roundhouse in Camden and a writer on the Soho Young Writers programme. As a songwriter she has supported artists 'The Tiger Lillies' and Camille O'Sullivan and has been making her show 'Elsa' for the past two years as part of her residency, wanting to create a show that brings the liveness of a gig audience into a theatre space. 'Elsa' has been developed with and supported by the Roundhouse &amp; Soho Theatre.</p>
<p>I am fascinated by the way women present themselves and what it means to be strong and powerful in todays society and I wanted to articulate these thoughts in a medium that would allow me to blend character-based storytelling with songwriting. During my time at the Roundhouse I started writing songs for female characters in plays whose stories didn't feel like their own and I wanted to reflect how this sense of incompleteness has been passed down through the generations in Elsa. In today’s society there is a strong impulse to attempt to become somebody else when the world is telling you that an artist’s life is not real and I wanted to explore these thoughts through the lens of a singer-songwriter; everyone sees a girl with a guitar as someone who is both vulnerable and powerful, and I wanted to take that image a step further by turning her into a character in a play. I want Elsa to bridge the gap between theatre and cabaret. Use performance to comment on female performativity and sing about and against the parts we are supposed to play. </p>
<p>The £2,000 raised here will go towards venue costs, equipment hire, marketing (posters and flyers, etc.) and fees for the creative and technical team. I have been self-funding the project for the past three years and doing my own fundraising for the show so this support would really give the project the security it needs to survive at the fringe. </p>
<p>If you're kind enough to donate to the show, you can expect some fantastic rewards in the form of handwritten letters from Edinburgh, personalised songs, free tickets to the show, and even a writers' workshop led by Isobel. </p>
<p>Obviously the risks involved in any fringe theatre production are immense: it is rare for shows to break even, and even rarer to turn a profit. There were over 3,000 shows at the fringe last year, so above and beyond the quality of the show, which has been honed through numerous preview shows at professional venues, it is imperative for us to have our marketing and publicity planned and executed down to the last detail; funding will hugely enhance the impact and reach of our efforts, and the team have been performing at or involved in the Edinburgh Fringe festival for the last ten years. </p>
<p>Even if you can't donate at this time, please do help us spread the word and we would love you to come and check out 'Elsa' if you're in Edinburgh this year, on at Assembly Hall, Baillie Room, at 9.30pm from the 3rd-27th August (not 14th). </p>

<h3>HOW did Pomegrenade Happen? </h3>

<p>It started when scientists decided to demote Pluto from solar system, which prompted me to become instantly obsessed with humanity's obsession with Pluto, as well as its moon, Kharon, both coming from Greek mythology, directly associated with Hades, lord of the underworld, and all the stories around that fascinating realm of unknown. Around the same time, news stories from Syria, Turkey, and frankly everywhere in the world, are streaming in, and I felt emotionally overwhelmed by the amount of tragedies around us. This story comes to be a retelling of how Persephone becomes the Queen of the dead, and the function of the underworld as a memory archive, a refuge of the forgotten. </p>

However, as dancers ourselves, we have noticed that as the community becomes more industrialized it's also grown a bit more shallow. As a result, many individuals have lost touch with the core reason why they ever started dance. Over the past few years, while dance has gotten much bigger, it's also become more intimidating for anyone who might have even the slightest interest to try and take a class. On the other hand, even if they do take a class, they are usually met with extremely overwhelming combinations and sometimes may not get any sort of feedback from the instructor. It is then that some decide that dance just isn't for them.<br/><br/><strong>Addressing our notion</strong><br/>We believe dance should always first and foremost be fun. We also believe it can be used as a tool to overcome personal hurdles as well as a way to communicate with others. At this convention, all of the instructors value your growth. We care about delivering the best of what we have to offer at a pace that's reasonable to the level of the class.<br/><br/><strong>More than just dance</strong><br/>We found that the industry panel from last year was very engaging and helpful to everyone there. Professionals who are active members in their communities (as well as the dance industry) shared personal stories and provided tips on what happens in their field of work and how they're trying to make an impact in their circles.<br/>The community conversation from last year also took us by surprise! The level of engagement we received was not what we were expecting. A scheduled 20 minutes easily went over an hour and we still weren't ready to stop talking! For this portion of the convention we invited local non-profits to speak about their cause and provide tips on how we could all improve our individual lives and our communities.<br/><br/>Has all the awesomeness convinced you to help put together this extravagant event yet? If not... look, a video down below.<br/><br/><strong>EAT SLEEP DANCE REPEAT 2015 RECAP</strong></p><h2>

Booking a place and finding instructors, panelists, non-profits, staff, videographers, photographers, a DJ, and an MC are things we're capable of doing. The event itself is great and gets a fair amount of exposure on social media. Our problem stems from non-attendees that questions the convention's value and sometimes becoming intimidated by the variety of styles that are offered.

Our mission is simple: inspire people to try.Once a year we come together to organize this event for the community. Whether it be conquering a personal fear or gaining knowledge towards future endeavors, our objective is to open doors to greater opportunities for our convention goers all while creating a long-lasting experience.What separates us from other conventions is the emphasis we put on conquering one's self-doubt. We also stress the importance of moving from a place that's authentic as opposed to egotistic and keeping an open mind to all the styles and methods of teaching that are presented to them. The atmosphere is non-competitive and focuses strictly on learning and exploring. But what makes this event even sweeter is that it costs up to 4 to 5 times less than other established conventions.Your contribution to this campaign will do wonders for so many people on a very personal level; that includes both staff and convention goers. We have been successful in creating memorable experiences in the past and have no doubts we can do it again this year.What We Need & What You GetThis year we are asking our community to help us reach our goal of $5000. Your generous contributions will go towards covering:
Venue
Insurance
Dance Instructors
Advertising
Photographer
Videographers
DJ
Sound System
Staff
If we happen to not meet our goal the convention will still take place. However, it will be much more difficult for us to tackle it financially.PERKS FOR YOU!We have a lot of exciting, interactive perks. Make sure you take a good look around. We have things such as:
private dance/ tumbling lessons
private music shows
private hangouts
discounted dance workshops
professional photo shoot
professional video shoot
musical cover requests
art requests

sponsor someone who wouldn't normally be able to attend the convention
Pre-order T-ShirtsWe are now taking T-Shirt Pre-Orders! Email: SFCLifestyle@gmail.com your size and quantity.THE IMPACTOur analysisThe dance community as a whole is a very bright place. However, as dancers ourselves, we have noticed that as the community becomes more industrialized it's also grown a bit more shallow. As a result, many individuals have lost touch with the core reason why they ever started dance. Over the past few years, while dance has gotten much bigger, it's also become more intimidating for anyone who might have even the slightest interest to try and take a class. On the other hand, even if they do take a class, they are usually met with extremely overwhelming combinations and sometimes may not get any sort of feedback from the instructor. It is then that some decide that dance just isn't for them.Addressing our notionWe believe dance should always first and foremost be fun. We also believe it can be used as a tool to overcome personal hurdles as well as a way to communicate with others. At this convention, all of the instructors value your growth. We care about delivering the best of what we have to offer at a pace that's reasonable to the level of the class.More than just danceWe found that the industry panel from last year was very engaging and helpful to everyone there. Professionals who are active members in their communities (as well as the dance industry) shared personal stories and provided tips on what happens in their field of work and how they're trying to make an impact in their circles.The community conversation from last year also took us by surprise! The level of engagement we received was not what we were expecting. A scheduled 20 minutes easily went over an hour and we still weren't ready to stop talking! For this portion of the convention we invited local non-profits to speak about their cause and provide tips on how we could all improve our individual lives and our communities.Has all the awesomeness convinced you to help put together this extravagant event yet? If not... look, a video down below.EAT SLEEP DANCE REPEAT 2015 RECAP
RISKS AND CHALLENGESThe biggest risk we take every year is not knowing whether or not we're going to break even financially. Booking a place and finding instructors, panelists, non-profits, staff, videographers, photographers, a DJ, and an MC are things we're capable of doing. The event itself is great and gets a fair amount of exposure on social media. Our problem stems from non-attendees that questions the convention's value and sometimes becoming intimidated by the variety of styles that are offered. Additionally, it may get overlooked by those who don't go to events like this unless there is a big name attached to it. This is the sad but true reality.We hope to change those outlooks by creating an even better experience this year and making sure that it is well documented online to raise more attention for next year as well as give this event more exposure earlier in the year.

<h3>Das Stück</h3>
<p>Die drei Protagonisten des Stückes, Anika, Silvia und Barbara sind Jugendamtsozialarbei­terinnen und stehen ständig unter der Herausforderung, die Lebenssituation ihrer anver­trauten Familien zu bewerten, zu überprüfen und entsprechende Entscheidungen zu tref­fen. Durch den krankheitsbedingten Ausfall des Mitarbeiters Björn („Björn-Out-Syndrom“), spitzt sich der tägliche Kampf gegen Ohnmacht, Überforderung und Kapitulation der Frau­en noch mehr zu, da sie dessen unerledigte und schlecht dokumentierte Fälle überneh­men müssen. Darüber hinaus muss jede der Sozialarbeiterinnen auch das eigene Leben gestalten und bewältigen. Anika ist frisch von der Fachhochschule und alleinerziehende Mutter einer vierjährigen Tochter. Silvia versucht immer mehr zu arbeiten, um das immer größer wer­dende Loch von Müdigkeit und scheinbarer Ergebnislosigkeit ihrer Arbeit zu stopfen. Bar­bara arbeitet schon zwanzig Jahre in der Verwaltung, hat selber 5 Kinder und träumt von Ruhe und Urlaub.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Die Autorin</h3>
<p>Felicia Zeller hat die Arbeitssituation der Sozialarbeiterinnen genau recherchiert. Es geht ihr nicht um Schuldzuweisung, sondern sie beschreibt nachvollziehbar verschiedene Sze­narien, wie sie tagtäglich in unserer Gesellschaft geschehen. Auf diese Weise kann der Zuschauer eine Empathie für alle Beteiligten entwickeln, ohne gleich in die Versuchung zu geraten, zu werten oder die Geschehnisse mit dem Gedanken: “Mich betrifft das ja nicht!“ von sich abzuwehren.</p>
<p>Tatsächlich ist die genaue Zahl von Kindesmisshandlungen in Deutschland auf Grund der hohen Dunkelziffer schwer zu bestimmen. Die polizeiliche Kriminalstatistik verzeichnete für das Jahr 2015 3441 Fälle von Kindesmisshandlung mit 3965 Opfern. Schätzungen zufolge sind es aber ca. 20.000 Kinder, die jährlich Opfer von Gewalt werden. Die seelischen und körperlichen Schäden aller Formen der Kindesmisshandlung prägen diese Kinder häufig ein Leben lang.

<p>Who are You?</p>
<p>6 Degrees Collaborative has been around since 2013. Since our inception we have provided free movement workshops to the Boys and Girls Club of Fort Collins, after school programs, community centers, and senior centers along the Colorado front range. 6 Degrees is a group of professional dancers, musicians, visual, and performing artists that have come together to bring affordable performing art experiences and productions to audiences along the Colorado Front Range. We craft our evening length shows by using inspired themes from old and original literary sources. 6 Degrees composes and arranges music and visuals around the  movement created by every member of the collaborative. We currently have a small, dedicated, and professional team from all different backgrounds and disciplines.  6 Degrees creates  and connects communities. We help people get out side of their box and bring awareness to the beauties in sutbletes, the extraordinary in the ordinary, we create an interest in art and literature that is often over looked in todays schools, high paced life, and popular culture.</p>
<p>What are you doing? What would me donating mean?</p>
<p>Your contribution means everything for the continuation of 6Degrees and our innovative advancements in the performing arts and our community outreach programs. Our community outreach programs have the potential to reach hundreds of youth, seniors, and special needs in schools, day programs, and centers across Fort Collins, Loveland, Boulder, and Denver areas. Many of the participants in our workshops have never had the opportunity to go to a dance class, never heard of the classical literature that we derive our performance from, have never heard the classic rock that we choreograph to, or have had the opportunity to meet, interact, and see a professional performing arts company. Many of the places that we visit are not able to afford the services that many of their clients benefit from. Putting together these outreach programs and affordable community performance demands time and money.</p>
<p>6Degree’s current workshop and performance is an educational, innovative, and immersive endeavor. We take on themes from Ancient Greek theatre, legends, monsters, and gods by using Homer’s the Odyssey abstractly and psychologically. Our audience is not only exposed modern dance but also classic and modern from the likes of David Bowie, Tori Amos, and original modern rock scores from 6 Degrees. Our free community workshops use our creation methods of creative movement, trust, team work, and confidence to build their own monster and create their own of moving art work, while teaching our participants about Ancient Greek stories that we were inspired from. These workshop are led by 6Degrees director and we plan on doing 5 starting at the end of February and continuing that pace of work shops for the rest of year with proper funding.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What do you need and what do I get?</p>
<p> We are trying to be as frugal as we can with our small budget. 6Degrees set a goal of 2,000 to help cover costs of many things that is quite tasking for a small, growing, non-profit:</p>
<p> Rehearsal space $9 hr for 4-6 hour minimum a week</p>
<p>Performers rehearsal time and performance fee (yes it sounds like a ton fun but it is very wearing on the body and it is work) 7 performers ideally $13 per hour for  4-6 hrs min per week rehearsal time and $200 performance fee</p>
<p> All of our dancers have day jobs and must take time off work to help make the performances happen</p>
<p>Marketing materials and inexpensive ads to help us get the word and reach more people. </p>
<p>This normally averages to be about $300 but be because of kind printers we are able to keep this cost slightly down. We do utilize as many free forms of advertising and public event calendars as possible. </p>
<p>Instructor’s fee for teaching Free community workshops to schools, daycare centers, senior centers community centers and day programs. These sessions run from 30mins to an hour and the instructor need at least $25 per hour to help compensate for time, travel expenses, and workshop planning.</p>
<p>Theatre Rental fees </p>
<p>Our most current fee is $350 for a day but this does not include a lighting designer…We will be paying about this for the next performances we have planned in the Spring and Summer of 2017 </p>
<p>Technical and lighting crew </p>
<p>These are the guys that really make the show look bangin’! With out them you would not get full theatrical feel. We have some very kind volunteers right now but this is also what these guys do for a living for these and we want to pay them what they deserve. This can cost up from anywhere to $300-$1000 for one show run.</p>
<p>costume and equipment maintenance</p>
<p> We want to look good for ya. Since we have a shoe string budget we have great looking costumes that need a little love after performing for you!</p>
<p>We will also be using these funds to go towards our current production on March 3rd and for upcoming future works based off early 20th century Sci-Fi novels in the summer and fall of 2017</p>
<p>6Degrees is offering many cool perks from posters, photos, original art work to private lessons and rehearsal peeks.</p>
<p>All contributions made will help pay for the things we listed above. A donation of any size is a tremendous help on our show string budget. We are building this wonderful interactive community project from the ground up and no contribution is too small or will go unnoticed!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Impact</p>
<p>After working with many kids and people from all backgrounds. I have learned that that people leave feeling inspired from dance and movement. Many kids I have talked to have never of Homer, the Odyssey, David Bowie, and many classic novels we draw inspiration from. For them it opens the doors to a rich culture experience they never thought possible. Many other participants have told me that never know dance could be accessible to them or presented in such a way like we have done. This strongly encouraging and our love for our audience and supporters continues to grow. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have just been awarded our 501c3 non-profit status. We started a kickstarter two years ago for the IRS filing fee and even had enough left over to help pay for rehearsal space. Our success in this campaign contributed to many generous friends, donors, and supporters that donated. Asking is not always easy for an artist but it is becoming increasingly necessary for projects such as ours to exist. We chose indiegogo because it is a safe and convenient way for you to donate to our cause. We are not asking for hand outs or for you to fund our hippie vacations. We are asking for help to fund a true asset to the community and our culture. Since we are a non-profit performing arts company we can apply for future grants and donations are tax-deductible.</p>
<p>We have 3 seasons of performing under our belt. 6Degrees has sold out performance and also performance many intimate shows.</p>
<p>Risks &amp; Challenges</p>
<p>We are in the business of the performing arts and any business there are risks and challenges. Our biggest challenge is having financial backing to take our productions to the next level or even maintain where we are at. Meaning nice lighting and sound to make the shows look and sound more professional, paying performers for rehearsal time, having more rehearsal time, providing pay to our instructors for our free workshops, giving more free workshops, and insuring pay for our hard working crew and cast.</p>

</div></div>","Who are You?
6 Degrees Collaborative has been around since 2013. Since our inception we have provided free movement workshops to the Boys and Girls Club of Fort Collins, after school programs, community centers, and senior centers along the Colorado front range. 6 Degrees is a group of professional dancers, musicians, visual, and performing artists that have come together to bring affordable performing art experiences and productions to audiences along the Colorado Front Range. We craft our evening length shows by using inspired themes from old and original literary sources. 6 Degrees composes and arranges music and visuals around the  movement created by every member of the collaborative. We currently have a small, dedicated, and professional team from all different backgrounds and disciplines.  6 Degrees creates  and connects communities. We help people get out side of their box and bring awareness to the beauties in sutbletes, the extraordinary in the ordinary, we create an interest in art and literature that is often over looked in todays schools, high paced life, and popular culture.
What are you doing? What would me donating mean?
Your contribution means everything for the continuation of 6Degrees and our innovative advancements in the performing arts and our community outreach programs. Our community outreach programs have the potential to reach hundreds of youth, seniors, and special needs in schools, day programs, and centers across Fort Collins, Loveland, Boulder, and Denver areas. Many of the participants in our workshops have never had the opportunity to go to a dance class, never heard of the classical literature that we derive our performance from, have never heard the classic rock that we choreograph to, or have had the opportunity to meet, interact, and see a professional performing arts company. Many of the places that we visit are not able to afford the services that many of their clients benefit from. Putting together these outreach programs and affordable community performance demands time and money.
6Degree’s current workshop and performance is an educational, innovative, and immersive endeavor. We take on themes from Ancient Greek theatre, legends, monsters, and gods by using Homer’s the Odyssey abstractly and psychologically. Our audience is not only exposed modern dance but also classic and modern from the likes of David Bowie, Tori Amos, and original modern rock scores from 6 Degrees. Our free community workshops use our creation methods of creative movement, trust, team work, and confidence to build their own monster and create their own of moving art work, while teaching our participants about Ancient Greek stories that we were inspired from. These workshop are led by 6Degrees director and we plan on doing 5 starting at the end of February and continuing that pace of work shops for the rest of year with proper funding.
 
What do you need and what do I get?
 We are trying to be as frugal as we can with our small budget. 6Degrees set a goal of 2,000 to help cover costs of many things that is quite tasking for a small, growing, non-profit:
 Rehearsal space $9 hr for 4-6 hour minimum a week
Performers rehearsal time and performance fee (yes it sounds like a ton fun but it is very wearing on the body and it is work) 7 performers ideally $13 per hour for  4-6 hrs min per week rehearsal time and $200 performance fee
 All of our dancers have day jobs and must take time off work to help make the performances happen
Marketing materials and inexpensive ads to help us get the word and reach more people. 
This normally averages to be about $300 but be because of kind printers we are able to keep this cost slightly down. We do utilize as many free forms of advertising and public event calendars as possible. 
Instructor’s fee for teaching Free community workshops to schools, daycare centers, senior centers community centers and day programs. These sessions run from 30mins to an hour and the instructor need at least $25 per hour to help compensate for time, travel expenses, and workshop planning.
Theatre Rental fees 
Our most current fee is $350 for a day but this does not include a lighting designer…We will be paying about this for the next performances we have planned in the Spring and Summer of 2017 
Technical and lighting crew 
These are the guys that really make the show look bangin’! With out them you would not get full theatrical feel. We have some very kind volunteers right now but this is also what these guys do for a living for these and we want to pay them what they deserve. This can cost up from anywhere to $300-$1000 for one show run.
costume and equipment maintenance
 We want to look good for ya. Since we have a shoe string budget we have great looking costumes that need a little love after performing for you!
We will also be using these funds to go towards our current production on March 3rd and for upcoming future works based off early 20th century Sci-Fi novels in the summer and fall of 2017
6Degrees is offering many cool perks from posters, photos, original art work to private lessons and rehearsal peeks.
All contributions made will help pay for the things we listed above. A donation of any size is a tremendous help on our show string budget. We are building this wonderful interactive community project from the ground up and no contribution is too small or will go unnoticed!
 
The Impact
After working with many kids and people from all backgrounds. I have learned that that people leave feeling inspired from dance and movement. Many kids I have talked to have never of Homer, the Odyssey, David Bowie, and many classic novels we draw inspiration from. For them it opens the doors to a rich culture experience they never thought possible. Many other participants have told me that never know dance could be accessible to them or presented in such a way like we have done. This strongly encouraging and our love for our audience and supporters continues to grow. 
 
We have just been awarded our 501c3 non-profit status. We started a kickstarter two years ago for the IRS filing fee and even had enough left over to help pay for rehearsal space. Our success in this campaign contributed to many generous friends, donors, and supporters that donated. Asking is not always easy for an artist but it is becoming increasingly necessary for projects such as ours to exist. We chose indiegogo because it is a safe and convenient way for you to donate to our cause. We are not asking for hand outs or for you to fund our hippie vacations. We are asking for help to fund a true asset to the community and our culture. Since we are a non-profit performing arts company we can apply for future grants and donations are tax-deductible.
We have 3 seasons of performing under our belt. 6Degrees has sold out performance and also performance many intimate shows.
Risks & Challenges
We are in the business of the performing arts and any business there are risks and challenges. Our biggest challenge is having financial backing to take our productions to the next level or even maintain where we are at. Meaning nice lighting and sound to make the shows look and sound more professional, paying performers for rehearsal time, having more rehearsal time, providing pay to our instructors for our free workshops, giving more free workshops, and insuring pay for our hard working crew and cast.
6Degrees is in its 5th year of creating and we have survived despite major financial backing, however our team and productions are growing and with out donations and grants the ability for us to enrich the community with innovative dance theatre, music, workshops and affordable performances will be nearly impossible.
