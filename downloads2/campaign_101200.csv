sales in Guanacaste exploded, high-end resorts and developments flourished,
including flag ship developments like the Papagayo Four Seasons hotel. New
highways were added and old ones reworked -- tourism and demand soared.
International flights started arriving in Liberia in 2002 and while that

airport, Palmar Sur Airport. The same scenario is starting to play out as it
did in the northern region. Although the project is currently out for tender

new Caldera highway (Pista del Sol) and expansion of the Costarena Sur highway.
This is driving more tourists to visit the south zone, as travel time from the
Central Valley to the region is reduced to approximately 3.5 hours. A new
hospital -- a requirement for an international airport -- is now fully
functional, including emergency helicopter service. Highway access onto the OSA

witnessed in the northern region with the arrival of the new international
airport. Interest in Dominical real estate, just 60 mile north of Palmar Sur,
has already seen an uptick in focus and sales. Dominical, although far less
developed than other regions, is well known locally as one of Costa Rica's
gems. However, the recent infrastructure improvements and the expansion of the

<p></p></div>","Welcome to the crowdfunding opportunity to start a fishing charter enterprise in Sierpe, Costa Rica. We Never Thought We Would Work AgainMy
name is Jesse Peeler. I owned and operated a successful charter fishing
business for 20 years in southwest Florida. After selling our business my wife
and I retired to Costa Rica believing we would never work again. That is, until we discovered the
unbelievably good fishing in the Sierpe River and Drake Bay area in the Osa
Peninsula of Costa Rica.We were so excited to find this area
and what it offered that we decided to start the J&J Fishing
venture. I am ready to fish again. I am excited. And I want you to be part
of this adventure. We want to make this dream a reality now.
Using this platform of raising money we not only hope to fund the start up
J&J Fishing, but through the perks offered in this effort we plan on
generating our client base. You will notice that our perks are basically
prepaid charters that are significantly discounted. This supports our desire to
make our contributors our clients. I want to share with other sport fishing
enthusiasts and contributors the terrific fishing available in the Sierpe River
and offshore in Drake Bay.
We thank you for considering our
campaign and for your support. We are looking forward to you using these perks
so that you might enjoy the spectacular fishing that prompted my wife and
me to sell the house we thought we would be in 'forever' ....and.....
....to want to work again.Captain Jesse, on board with friend, Captain Pablo, and on Captain Pablo's boat on Drake Bay.
What We Need & What You GetThe type of boat and motor,
tackle requirements, and start up costs are based on my 20+
years experience in the charter fishing business and dictate what is necessary to
make this a viable project. The charter fishing business that I started,
operated, and eventually sold was and still is one of the most successful
charter fishing businesses in southwest Florida. My 20 years of experience
gives me the knowledge to start and operate this company in the same successful
manner. I want you to be part of my success. The breakdown of our funding needs are as follows:·     $42,000  Boat and Motor·         5,000   Tackle·         5,000   Campaign Costs·        3,000   Misc. Start Up Costs,
including boat prep  The boat will be made by a local manufacturer specializing in
commercial boats that are used for transportation and fishing on the Sierpe
River and Drake Bay. We have already selected the hull type and it is a 22'
center console that can accommodate four anglers easily.The motor/power will be a 150 Yamaha 4 stroke purchased from a
Yamaha dealer in Sierpe. What a surprisingly good break to have a parts dealer
and a certified Yamaha mechanic minutes away. If you or those you know love fishing, we hope you  will use the perks offered in this campaign for yourself or as gifts to others.Our current charter rates are $60 per person per hour for river
tours, $450 1/2 day charter and $850 for a full day charter. The fishing
charter rates are all inclusive for four people. In the event our funding needs aren't completely met, we will
fund the balance required from the funds received from the eventual sale of our
house which is currently on the market (www.costaricadream.net).
Jeane and I are totally commtted to this exciting venture and we
want you to share this life-dream with us. Thank youBOATING TOWARDS THE TOWN OF
SIERPE, a small fishing village in the Osa Peninsula.
Sierpe is the stepping off place, only by boat, to exclusive resorts, Corcovado National Park, off
shore fishing in Drake Bay and outrageous fishing on the Sierpe River.The
future of Sierpe and J&J FishingOne of the reasons the fishing in this area is so good is
because up until this time it has been difficult to access and hence, under
fished. Now, the improvement in the roads, the local airfield, and Costa Rica’s
commitment to facilitate traffic to and from a new International Airport that
will soon be built has radically changed the access to Sierpe and the immediate
area.The following article is from Latin America Real Estate
News:Knowing when an area is going to move from low demand to
high demand is key to smart real estate investing. One of the best investment
indicators is new infrastructure, especially new airports which open
international access to underdeveloped regions of exceptional value.During Costa Rica's first boom, the Liberia airport in the
northern region was upgraded to receive international flights. Real estate
sales in Guanacaste exploded, high-end resorts and developments flourished,
including flag ship developments like the Papagayo Four Seasons hotel. New
highways were added and old ones reworked -- tourism and demand soared.
International flights started arriving in Liberia in 2002 and while that
investment wave has subsided, the Gold Coast is still one of Costa Rica's best
investment bets.Now Palmar Sur, in Costa Rica's southern zone, is
receiving international status with a $42 million expansion to the national
airport, Palmar Sur Airport. The same scenario is starting to play out as it
did in the northern region. Although the project is currently out for tender
there are whispers of closed door deals already circulating and tell tale signs
in the real estate market that something big is on the horizon for the southern
zone.According to Costa Rica´s Civil Aviation Authority
(Aviación Civil) development in underway between the towns of Sierpe and Palmar
Sur, with the target opening date set for 2014.Phase one of the airport will boast a runway approximately
2,500 meters long, large enough for Boeing 747s, Airbus and A320s. The terminal
in phase one will accommodate 150 passengers simultaneously, while
transatlantic flights will be added in phase two, increasing the terminal size.Other support infrastructure has ramped up including the
new Caldera highway (Pista del Sol) and expansion of the Costarena Sur highway.
This is driving more tourists to visit the south zone, as travel time from the
Central Valley to the region is reduced to approximately 3.5 hours. A new
hospital -- a requirement for an international airport -- is now fully
functional, including emergency helicopter service. Highway access onto the OSA
Peninsula from Palmar Sur was also greatly improved.The entire southern zone is expected to mirror the growth
witnessed in the northern region with the arrival of the new international
airport. Interest in Dominical real estate, just 60 mile north of Palmar Sur,
has already seen an uptick in focus and sales. Dominical, although far less
developed than other regions, is well known locally as one of Costa Rica's
gems. However, the recent infrastructure improvements and the expansion of the
airport has brought it to the attention of investors and developers. Southern Costa Rica is the home of the famous
Corcovado National Park on the OSA Peninsula, a place National Geographic
called ""the most biologically intense place on earth."" Opening this
unique tropical eco region to international access has many experts in the
Costa Rica real estate market excited about the prospect of a second growth
boom.
 
EXISTING PALMAR SUR AIRPORT is a 15 minute drive to Sierpe. From the international airport in San Jose air time in 30 minutes to the Palmar Sur Airport. By car, travel time is approximately 4 hours to Sierpe.Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just
can’t contribute, but that doesn’t mean they can’t help:Ask folks to get the
word out and make some noise about fishing in Sierpe and J&J Fishing.
 And, remember, a charter fishing trip is a great gift!!!!

<h3>Why do we need you? </h3>
<p>Dear Friends of Douar Samra and Riad Samsara</p>
<p>For the last 20 years, these two houses have changed my life. They brought the sunshine back into my life. And I have been lucky enough to have shared these two exceptional houses with you, my dear friends and travellers.</p>
<p>And then a black cloud descended from far away and has affected our life, mine, yours and ours. This cloud confines us and separates us. It has temporarily deprived us of the moments that we could have shared together in Morocco. But our houses are full of hope. My team is ready for your return.</p>
<p>Even from a distance you can also support us. For this reason, I suggest that you start planning your next stay with us and I am offering you these special prices:</p>
<p>At <a href=""http://riad-samsara.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Riad Samsara</strong></a> in the Marrakech Medina, the price per room of €60/£50 per night, for two persons (including breakfast)</p>
<p>At <a href=""https://douar-samra.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Douar Samra</strong></a> in the high Atlas Mountains, the price per room of €80/£70 per night, for two persons (including breakfast and dinner)</p>
<p>Please note that both offers are valid for the next 24 months. </p>
<p>This is an opportunity to project ourselves together into the future and hope. And perceive the rays of the sun again in these dark hours. Thank you my friends for your support over the years and we look forward to welcoming you back to again.</p>
<p>With my sincere good wishes</p>
<p>Jacqueline Brandt</p>

The sneaker with 4-in-1 versatility: providing the benefits of aqua shoes, the comfort of sport shoes, the technical outsole materials of hiking shoes, and the styling of your favorite daily pieces. 

 

 In order to cover all our necessities man has designed a lot of different kind of shoes: sneakers, outdoor shoes, hiking shoes, aqua shoes, slippers… However all this footwear is so specific that if we don’t want to have any problem while packing for the next big adventure, we are forced to sacrifice on comfort and convenience.   
 
 
   
 
 
 
 The 3D materials adapt to you, breath and let the water go through, absorbing as little as possible. We have partnered with Cosmo Fabrics, and use their materials and patented treatments, like Agion® and Combat™.  Cosmo is a revolutionary performance and marketing-based textiles and composites, all done in an environmentally responsible mode and vegan friendly. The diverse product line is designed and styled in the USA, yet either manufactured in their own plants in Southeast Asia or in the USA.

<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">OUR STORY</span></h3>
<p>We are Y Athletics, and our mission is to simplify your life with thoughtfully designed gear you can fall in love with. To do that, we engineer each product from scratch, with materials and components tailored specifically towards them. By focusing on every single detail, we are able to strike the perfect balance between performance, comfort, and style. We don't make too many products, but whatever we do make screams quality and craftsmanship.</p>
<p>After many months and hundreds of hours in development, we got the formula right for our socks. We are proud to introduce the SilverAir Sock -<i> It's beautiful. It's comfortable. It's odorless. It just works.</i></p>

<p><br/><b>Development</b><br/>This is a brand new fabric. We sourced the finest merino wool from Australia, known for its natural performance and odor-resistant qualities. But wool by itself is not soft enough, so we added acrylic for superior comfort, nylon for durability, and spandex for stretch recoverability. Finally, we blended pure silver on the areas that accumulate the most sweat, which takes the odor-fighting capability of this sock to a whole new level, unlike anything you’ve experienced.

<p>After fabrication comes construction and we iterated until it was just right. We used seamless knitting to create a sock without any stitches and added vent panels that allow airflow to keep your feet cool and comfortable. The sock is beautiful inside and out. After you've worn it a few times, you won’t be able to go back to anything else. 
</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Testing</b><br/>We've been testing our socks rigorously over the last 9 months. A backer from our first campaign cycled 800 miles for two weeks wearing the same pair of SilverAir socks. A decathlon athlete wore them through his entire race and the socks stayed fresh. And, of course, we wear them every day ourselves. Every test led to improvement until we got them just right. </p>

These structures are impervious to wildfires, hurricanes, or tornadoes, and would suffer minimal damage in an earthquake or flood.

We would like to raise an additional $25,000 for landscaping improvements, road maintenance and administrative expenses so that these tasks are completed in time for our first guests get the benefits instead of waiting until our revenue stream can cover them.

The SegSac™ is more than just a stuff sack. It's organized adventure in a bag.


















Never let the hassle of disorganization slow you down again. With the SegSac™,you will only need to organize your gear once. 
Pack with confidence knowing all your gear will remain exactly as you packed it when you arrive to your destination.


The SegSac™ gives you the peace of mind that you'll spend more time exploring the world and less time searching the depths of your backpack. 


4 internal compartments keep gear individually separated yet together in one place, making the SegSac™ the most simple, practical and organizational stuff sack on the market.









By conveniently separating your gear while on-the-go, you can say goodbye to stuffing dirty socks next to your clean t-shirts or wasting precious time searching for one lost item. 
Travelers and backpackers alike know that surprises should be in what's over the next peak, not what's in their backpack.  


And when every square inch counts? Upgrade to the SegSac™ Compression and save tons of space in your pack!








We all love to explore the world around us and to satisfy our natural curiosities. Whether we are heading out for a day outdoors or an adventure of a lifetime, we all spend time organizing the gear and clothes we'll need.
But why spend so much time packing in a neat and orderly fashion if you can't keep it that way? At home, everything has its place. Why can't a similar system exist for when we travel? The solution is the SegSac™.


Designed around the principal of empowering active people to do more with their time outdoors, the SegSac™ is the do anything / go anywhere stuff sack designed for ruggedness, quality, and performance.



4 Internal Compartments: Keeps gear internally separated, yet still in one place for easy and quick access to what you need. These compartments are sewn to the bottom so that items will not slide around and jump compartments.

Ultra-Light Fabric: Super light yet ultra-durable fabric means you get the best quality fabric without being weighed down.

Nylon Handle in Back: Allows you to grab your SegSac™ quickly from your bag.

Drawstring: Durable drawstring allows you to quickly open or close your SegSac™.

Optional Compression Straps: Need every inch you can get when you pack? Four compression straps will ensure your bag is both organizing and space-saving.


Available in Multiple Sizes: Available in two sizes: 15 liter capacity and 20 liter capacity for the SegSac™ and the SegSac™ Compress.

Water resistant: This stuff sack is NOT a dry bag, but water will conveniently bead off it should it get sprayed.  







People with an active lifestyle know the benefits of being organized - it means more time doing what they love. Fussing in your pack for lost items is time that could have been spent hiking another mile or setting up a campsite before sunset.


It was important to Gobi Gear that we designed a product that not only provided increased organization, but also one that is functional enough to withstand any adventure thrown at it.


Take it on the more demanding trips, like a thru-hike on the Appalachian trail, to the more recreational outings such as a picnic at your local park. Anywhere you go, the SegSac™ is aimed to never let the hassle of disorganization slow you down again.




With two unique products - the SegSac™ and SegSac™ Compress - you can be assured that your gear remains organized throughout your journey.
We invite you to pack with confidence. Each product is specially designed to fityour packing needs.





Instead of taking the place of your trusty backpack, the SegSac™ is designed to go INSIDE other bags. This allows you to use all the gear you are familiar with, but with the added organizational benefits of the SegSac™.
The handle in the back allows for quick and easy access to the SegSac™ from within your backpack. The nylon strings and cord lock allow you to quickly open/close the bag to find the exact item you need. Factor in the ultra-light fabric (making the bag virtually undetectable), and the SegSac™ becomes an ideal addition to your traveling gear.






Don't Let Your Packing Efforts Go to Waste on the Trail
Everyone has their own packing method. We all spend time organizing our gear in a way that we hope will make it easily accessible later on.

<p>This is what Knife Informer tells us about Damascus steel: ""Hence, Damascus steel is not pure. In fact, this uniqueness is its charm and its mystery. The material is characterized by multiple bands and mottling welded together in patterned fashion to create decorative blades of any shape and/or length with an inability to shatter. The identification of composites in original Damascus steel remains unknown today, as no records exist describing them. Yet modern Damascus steel-making follows the practice of combining pure metals, varying in terms of personal preference and need. Though metalworkers can choose and blend materials to form steel billets, iron is favored for its carbide-enhanced solidity and fortitude.""</p>

It is designed to turn the folding knife into a reliable cutting tool. The sharp edge is perfect for cutting perfect slices of cucumber, as well as resizing thick pieces of rope. Comparison of the costs  In addition to durability features we choose the damascus steel because it reminds us of the knives our grandfathers had. Regarding that, we want to create a knife that is not only useful, but one that is meant to be special. Offered by the damascus blade we will include a leather cover which can be attached to your belt. The reason for which this cover is so unique is because of the braided edges and because of the special models that can be found on the leather. You can rest assured that the knife will not fall out of the support because it has a staple which you can use to secure the knife in it's place. Materials:  Blade: Damascus Steel  Handle: Walnut Wood  Cover: Leather  All the materials are selected to fit the purpose for which the folding knife was made. The Great Sharpy:
resistant blade
comfortable in your hand
durable handle
sharp edge
leather cover

Domestic shipments may take 3-5 business days for delivery.INTERNATIONAL SHIPMENTSFor international orders (outside the US), shipping is FOB Destination, Freight Collect. This means that you must pay all freight and required duties/taxes. Since orders can be placed all over the world, it is impossible to determine and account for the numerous duties, taxes, and shipping variances for every potential country/location. We hope you understand, and we will use our shipping services to ensure you get the best shipping rate available! When it comes time to deliver, we will contact you to collect the necessary shipping and taxes/duties.Shipment estimates for your particular international location can be estimated using a carrier of your choice with shipment origination from Wilmington, NC, USA.  International shipments may take 7-21 business days for delivery.You can estimate duties and taxes for your location here:https://www.simplyduty.com/import-calculator/   Despite being a start-up, we have progressed very quickly through concept, design, and prototyping for the Migration Duffel and Dopp Kit. We have been able to accomplish all of this with very little cash forward.  Additionally, we have successfully raised enough funding on Kickstarter to move to production and even produce additional product ""stock"" beyond what is necessary to supply those who backed our Kickstarter!  As of now, production is underway and we are offering the Migration Duffel and Duck Dopp Kit on Indiegogo InDemand!  We have secured a highly reputable manufacturer, and based on manufacturing estimates, the first production run can be complete as early as mid-January 2019.  Our hope is that by further selling these products on Indiegogo, it will assist in launching the Duckworthy brand and upcoming projects/products, which are already into prototyping. With our professional backgrounds in the schedule driven Infrastructure Project Management and results driven Fin-Tech sectors, we have worked aggressively to build Duckworthy up to this point and we don't have any intentions of slowing down or compromising our commitment to quality or on-time delivery!At Duckworthy, we're not just attempting to fund a singular new product, but instead an entire brand culture focused on high quality, versatile gear with classic form and modern function - products that last and make a statement.We hope you will join us in our endeavors and THANK YOU for your support!",42.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We're so excited to bring JoeyWears to you guys here on Indiegogo. It's been a wild ride so far, with our campaign becoming the most backed apparrel campaign in the UK which is massive.

<p>We've been working hard for the past year, traveling to Paris to find the best fabric and all over the world to find an ethical, high-quality manufacturer who is as excited as we were about the project. Over the last month we've been jonied by an army of over 1500 heros - and we'd love to you to join the squad. </p>
<p>Please support at whatever level you're comfortable with. We'll return the favor with some really awesome underwear, crafted for comfort with super-high quality materials you’re going to love. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><b>Co-Founder, Homer the Cat</b></i></p>
<div style=""text-align: left;"">
<p>An idea to create an affordable high quality
camera for the whole family was long brewing in our minds. And then one day our
co-founder Elnaz’s cat Homer became a change agent.</p>
<p>Yes, cat. Homer, just like the ancient
philosopher, spent his days deliberating about life, while Elnaz was at work.
If Homer could talk, he would probably tell us that he just wanted to play with
someone. Greeting Elnaz with a long ‘Meoooooooow’ after work probably meant, ‘I
want to plaaaay’.</p>
<p>And this is how Homer changed the world.
Helmet stemmed from the idea that Homer was bored being home alone when he
could be jumping, meowing, and doing other things good for a new viral cat
video instead. Helmet allows all that and more. Any pet owner can now take
photos, play chase with their pets using the laser and communicate through two
way audio – all while being away.</p>

HELMET WHO?




Meet Helmet, iFamCare’s first family monitor, with lots of fun added to it. Helmet is a family monitor which allows you to watch over your home, pet, parents, or any valuables. That's not it - Helmet has a built-in laser that you can turn on and play with your cat, dog, rabbit, or any pet who loves to chase it.




STORY BEHIND HELMET CREATION

Co-Founder, Homer the Cat

An idea to create an affordable high quality
camera for the whole family was long brewing in our minds. And then one day our
co-founder Elnaz’s cat Homer became a change agent.
Yes, cat. Homer, just like the ancient
philosopher, spent his days deliberating about life, while Elnaz was at work.
If Homer could talk, he would probably tell us that he just wanted to play with
someone. Greeting Elnaz with a long ‘Meoooooooow’ after work probably meant, ‘I
want to plaaaay’.
And this is how Homer changed the world.
Helmet stemmed from the idea that Homer was bored being home alone when he
could be jumping, meowing, and doing other things good for a new viral cat
video instead. Helmet allows all that and more. Any pet owner can now take
photos, play chase with their pets using the laser and communicate through two
way audio – all while being away.

Hi, 
I'm Inge Baars and I'm a international business student from the Netherlands. I want to introduce you to a new global travel community for students; GlobalLeaf travel community. 
GlobalLeaf gives you the opportunity to experience the cities that you're visiting in a new way. Whether you're in your home country or abroad, you will know where to go for the local spots, the cheaper restuarants, the student bars and the free events. 
Also, you can meet up with other members for a drink, party or even a small sightseeing tour. And to help you find your favourite restaurant, bar or activity, GlobalLeaf provides you with ratings from other students & backpackers to guide you to the perfect places. 
The story
During six
months of traveling, I realized that I want use my education in International
business and management, combine it with my passion for traveling and finish it
off with my drive to improve. This mix of abilities and interests led to the
creation of a global travel community for students and backpackers, called
GlobalLeaf. Let me tell you some more about GlobalLeaf.



Don’t
worry, you’re not the only one with this experience. However, there is also
another way to visit a city.











This will provide students & backpackers with a better, enriched travel map:




Apart from
giving travellers a better experience of the city, small ventures are helped by
the initiative of GlobalLeaf as well. Whenever a tip about a venture is posted
on the website, this venture has the opportunity to promote itself on a page of
the website. This is not just a banner or website-link, but a short message to
tell the GlobalLeaf members why they are worth a visit. They also have the
opportunity to provide members with a discount, which can only be granted when
a review of the venture is posted on GlobalLeaf.  This way, the smaller ventures in the cities
have the chance to promote themselves at very low costs, attract customers and
build up a trusted image on the ratings page of GlobalLeaf for future use.
Many people are willing to show others around and let them feel at home when they're on the other side of the world, but not all of them want to spend an entire day doing so. With GlobalLeaf members can be as active as they like. 

The goal of GlobalLeaf is to enable students & backpackers to experience the actual city instead of the touristic version, and to enable local ventures to promote themselves without having to spend lots of money. 
Helping GlobalLeaf to become globally active will help students, backpackers and local ventures financially and add experiences to peoples lives. Small, local ventures don't need to waste money on promoting without results, but only need a small amount to reach their target group. 

What you fund and what you get
The website for GlobalLeaf has already been set up a little while ago through my personal funding. The website needs adjustments and maintaining in order to expand worldwide. This is what fundings are used for:



Website maintainment and improvements (which include more Google-map features for localization, click-through-links between the maps and the Ratings-page and the option for non-members to leave posts).


Reaching out to people all over the world through marketing campaigns


Setting up a network of motivated ambassadors in every country that GlobalLeaf is active in in order to have national knowledge of cultures and habits. 



If these goals are met, the next step is to create an application for phones and tablets. 
Most costs will be in the website, as this is the main product and needs to function well and be user friendly. 
Every donated amount is very welcome! 
When I don't reach my entire funding goal, the raised money will be spend on as much maintainence as possible and campaigns to spread the word about GlobalLeaf worldwide. 


The Impact
Other travel organizations ended up changing their goals and going for the money instead of staying true to their believe. I want to create a community in which freedom is given to the members and they help each other because they want to. Ventures that are posted about by members get the option to promote themselves on a separate page, so that GlobalLeaf is really made by its members. 
Every city will have promotional space for 1 bar, 1 restuarant and 1 attraction.  This gives the ventures a unique place on the site, on which they can promote themselves for up to one month in a row. This enables a fast circulation of ventures. The amount of ventures per city will be increased when discounts are given to the members of GlobalLeaf.

<h2>STORY</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why am I planning this Solo Trek ?</h3>
<p>This year I am in my Senior Year at Noosa Pengari Steiner School (here in Oz) before I am set free into the world of adulthood.</p>
<p>As happens with Steiner Schools around the world, as part of my final year assessment I must carry out a project of my own devising – with the emphasis not only on education but also on personal development. AKA I must come up with a project that seems near to impossible to execute, but then through resourcefulness, lateral-thinking and a hell of a lot of hard work… ultimately discover for myself  ‘I'm possible’.</p>
<p>So in light of the brief, I have chosen to do something that i would imagine very few people my age have done. I have chosen to plan &amp; execute a solo hike across an island in a remote wilderness location and push myself to the limits of physical, emotional &amp; mental endurance. Upon my return I will then create a website that documents my trip and inspires other young and old people to find and push beyond their own boundaries and ultimately get their butt out into nature!</p>
<p><strong>Why have I chosen to do a hike?</strong><br/>Most simply put, I have an impetuous passion for the outdoors and an urge to explore new territory. When I am outdoors in nature with no human development in sight, I feel a sense of awareness and personal freedom.  It's a feeling that portrays for me how I wish to live my life. </p>
<p>By undertaking this project I hope to affect people with my passion and hearten them to live their life in solidarity with their own heart-felt passions. Basically, ANYTHING is possible in life, when you follow the truth of who you are and follow your dreams.</p>
<p>Also, being a passionate lover of photography, trekking ‘off the beaten track’ enables me to capture images of landscapes that are largely unseen… further enkindling others to get back to nature and love the beauty of this planet.</p>
<p><strong>And why Hinchinbrook Island? </strong> It is Australia's largest island National Park and is very biodiverse, featuring a jagged range of granite mountains rising to 1121 metres, pristine beaches, waterfalls, coral reefs, dense rainforests and woodlands. It is also home to many animal species in particular an abundant bird life, turtles, dolphins and crocodiles. The island also has a rich Aboriginal history, which I am eager to research and discover. However the best part of all is its remote, unspoiled and nearly deserted by humans as the whole island is very limited to human interaction. </p>
<p><strong>More about my Website... </strong>Upon completion of my trek, I will be creating my very own website  CallumMatthews.com (coming soon), all by myself from the ground up… yep, another ‘trek’ into the unknown for me !</p>
<p>My website will focus on ‘Outdoor Adventure Trips’. I will start by documenting my Hinchinbrook island trek in detail and include detailed information that will aid other hikers in their planning &amp; execution of remote hikes. Here is a glimpse of what I will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Hinchinbrook island</strong> – Everything you need to know about the trail: logistics, itinerary, trail conditions, safety, equipment, food (preparing &amp; dehydrating your own, meal planning)… basically everything!</li>
<li>
<strong>Solo Hiking</strong> - An insight into my personal experiences solo hiking – including the ‘do’s’ and the 'don'ts'.</li>
<li>
<strong>Photography</strong> - A photographic section to display the breath-taking scenery of Hinchinbrook Island displaying its beautiful wilderness that people rarely see.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I finish school at the end of this year, over time I envision this website to grow and expand covering further areas of Australia and who knows, maybe the world ! </p>
<h3>I have done the numbers…</h3>
<p>Over the last 12 months I have been saving money and have purchased some of the equipment necessary to make my Hinchinbrook island trek possible.</p>
<p>Now, as part of my High School Senior Year 12 Project, I have completed a full budget of the trip. Ouch !!!  Even though I have already made quite a significant investment myself, I am still short a bit. As this is a solo-trek in a very remote location (meaning I may not see any other person on the trail for a full week), it is essential that I take the necessary precautions, including professional safety equipment, for my own health, survival &amp; well-being.</p>
<p>Whilst I am covering out of my own pocket (with the help of Mum &amp; Dad) all travel &amp; accommodation, (to and from Hinchinbrook) as well as borrowing many items from school, family &amp; friends, there are still a number of specialty items that I need to purchase/hire for this remote trek:</p>
<p><strong>Lightweight Tent</strong>:  For this type of trip, I will need to invest in a rugged lightweight and weather proof tent that will last me for this trip and into my future of hiking.</p>
<p><strong>Safety Equipment</strong>:  After significant research, there are some things that I just can’t do without and are essential for mitigating the risks of this trip.  Essentially, I will NOT be able to do the trip at all without any of these items:  GPS, PLB (personal locator beacon), satellite phone (hire costs) and remote location first aid kit.</p>
<p><strong>Education &amp; Survival</strong>:  Whilst I am an avid hiker and have trekked many high skill/difficulty hikes in the past (Angels Landing in Zion National Park, USA was one of my most favourites), I am keenly aware that this adventure is on the high risk level.  PLUS, as I am hiking solo in a remote location which adds further significant risk to this hike.  As a result, I will need to invest in education sources that help me with my risk mitigation plans, scenario planning &amp; emergency contingencies.  Whilst I already have a specialized ‘Remote Location First Aid Certificate’, I will need to refresh the course contents and must also embark on further studies (including practice hikes) to ensure I am thoroughly prepared.</p>
<p><strong>Food</strong>: Most of the dehydrated packet meals on the market are filled with nasties and are not nutritionally sound. I have already begun undertaking extensive research in meal preparation for remote hikes and have also started to prepare 'test' dehydrated meals. Consequently, I will purchase and dehydrate all of my own food to meet all of my nutritional/energy requirements for this trip… which is HUGE for a 17 year old boy. I might just need a bigger bag! I also plan on meeting with specialised people in sports nutrition.  I look forward to sharing all my knowledge with you too on my new website.</p>
<p>All of the above items are necessities for the trip and will last me for years and years to come.  After this trek I plan on putting the above items to good use by planning future adventures and documenting these trips on my website.   </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Here is where I would love your help…</h3>
<p>I have put over 500+ hours into this trip so far… planning, sourcing equipment &amp; undertaking extensive research. I have now reached a point where I need to raise funds to purchase the above specialty equipment. </p>
<p>The timeframe is very tight as I need to embark on a practice trek to test all the safety equipment and streamline the plan for my Hinchinbrook hike. All this must be completed over the next few weeks, such that I am well-prepared for my mid-June 2017 journey.</p>
<p>If you believe in the greater potential of my trek, what I am trying to achieve and my future aspirations, then I would be so grateful for your support in making this trek possible.  </p>
<p>In return, for each level of support that you give, you receive a <strong>PERK</strong>. Essentially, a PERK is a gift from me as a HUGE THANK YOU for your support.</p>
<p>The <strong>PERKS</strong> you will receive include some of my most favourite photos that I have taken on my travels to date around Australia, North America, Europe and Asia. I have put together photographs that I believe portray these incredible places in the best way. I hope that when people view my work they can feel like they were there and experienced each moment. I know you will love my photographic work and I am really excited to be able to share my photos with you all.

</div></div>","STORY
 
Why am I planning this Solo Trek ?
This year I am in my Senior Year at Noosa Pengari Steiner School (here in Oz) before I am set free into the world of adulthood.
As happens with Steiner Schools around the world, as part of my final year assessment I must carry out a project of my own devising – with the emphasis not only on education but also on personal development. AKA I must come up with a project that seems near to impossible to execute, but then through resourcefulness, lateral-thinking and a hell of a lot of hard work… ultimately discover for myself  ‘I'm possible’.
So in light of the brief, I have chosen to do something that i would imagine very few people my age have done. I have chosen to plan & execute a solo hike across an island in a remote wilderness location and push myself to the limits of physical, emotional & mental endurance. Upon my return I will then create a website that documents my trip and inspires other young and old people to find and push beyond their own boundaries and ultimately get their butt out into nature!
Why have I chosen to do a hike?Most simply put, I have an impetuous passion for the outdoors and an urge to explore new territory. When I am outdoors in nature with no human development in sight, I feel a sense of awareness and personal freedom.  It's a feeling that portrays for me how I wish to live my life. 
By undertaking this project I hope to affect people with my passion and hearten them to live their life in solidarity with their own heart-felt passions. Basically, ANYTHING is possible in life, when you follow the truth of who you are and follow your dreams.
Also, being a passionate lover of photography, trekking ‘off the beaten track’ enables me to capture images of landscapes that are largely unseen… further enkindling others to get back to nature and love the beauty of this planet.
And why Hinchinbrook Island?  It is Australia's largest island National Park and is very biodiverse, featuring a jagged range of granite mountains rising to 1121 metres, pristine beaches, waterfalls, coral reefs, dense rainforests and woodlands. It is also home to many animal species in particular an abundant bird life, turtles, dolphins and crocodiles. The island also has a rich Aboriginal history, which I am eager to research and discover. However the best part of all is its remote, unspoiled and nearly deserted by humans as the whole island is very limited to human interaction. 
More about my Website... Upon completion of my trek, I will be creating my very own website  CallumMatthews.com (coming soon), all by myself from the ground up… yep, another ‘trek’ into the unknown for me !
My website will focus on ‘Outdoor Adventure Trips’. I will start by documenting my Hinchinbrook island trek in detail and include detailed information that will aid other hikers in their planning & execution of remote hikes. Here is a glimpse of what I will cover:


Hinchinbrook island – Everything you need to know about the trail: logistics, itinerary, trail conditions, safety, equipment, food (preparing & dehydrating your own, meal planning)… basically everything!

Solo Hiking - An insight into my personal experiences solo hiking – including the ‘do’s’ and the 'don'ts'.

Photography - A photographic section to display the breath-taking scenery of Hinchinbrook Island displaying its beautiful wilderness that people rarely see.

When I finish school at the end of this year, over time I envision this website to grow and expand covering further areas of Australia and who knows, maybe the world ! 
I have done the numbers…
Over the last 12 months I have been saving money and have purchased some of the equipment necessary to make my Hinchinbrook island trek possible.
Now, as part of my High School Senior Year 12 Project, I have completed a full budget of the trip. Ouch !!!  Even though I have already made quite a significant investment myself, I am still short a bit. As this is a solo-trek in a very remote location (meaning I may not see any other person on the trail for a full week), it is essential that I take the necessary precautions, including professional safety equipment, for my own health, survival & well-being.
Whilst I am covering out of my own pocket (with the help of Mum & Dad) all travel & accommodation, (to and from Hinchinbrook) as well as borrowing many items from school, family & friends, there are still a number of specialty items that I need to purchase/hire for this remote trek:
Lightweight Tent:  For this type of trip, I will need to invest in a rugged lightweight and weather proof tent that will last me for this trip and into my future of hiking.
Safety Equipment:  After significant research, there are some things that I just can’t do without and are essential for mitigating the risks of this trip.  Essentially, I will NOT be able to do the trip at all without any of these items:  GPS, PLB (personal locator beacon), satellite phone (hire costs) and remote location first aid kit.
Education & Survival:  Whilst I am an avid hiker and have trekked many high skill/difficulty hikes in the past (Angels Landing in Zion National Park, USA was one of my most favourites), I am keenly aware that this adventure is on the high risk level.  PLUS, as I am hiking solo in a remote location which adds further significant risk to this hike.  As a result, I will need to invest in education sources that help me with my risk mitigation plans, scenario planning & emergency contingencies.  Whilst I already have a specialized ‘Remote Location First Aid Certificate’, I will need to refresh the course contents and must also embark on further studies (including practice hikes) to ensure I am thoroughly prepared.
Food: Most of the dehydrated packet meals on the market are filled with nasties and are not nutritionally sound. I have already begun undertaking extensive research in meal preparation for remote hikes and have also started to prepare 'test' dehydrated meals. Consequently, I will purchase and dehydrate all of my own food to meet all of my nutritional/energy requirements for this trip… which is HUGE for a 17 year old boy. I might just need a bigger bag! I also plan on meeting with specialised people in sports nutrition.  I look forward to sharing all my knowledge with you too on my new website.
All of the above items are necessities for the trip and will last me for years and years to come.  After this trek I plan on putting the above items to good use by planning future adventures and documenting these trips on my website.   
 

Here is where I would love your help…
I have put over 500+ hours into this trip so far… planning, sourcing equipment & undertaking extensive research. I have now reached a point where I need to raise funds to purchase the above specialty equipment. 
The timeframe is very tight as I need to embark on a practice trek to test all the safety equipment and streamline the plan for my Hinchinbrook hike. All this must be completed over the next few weeks, such that I am well-prepared for my mid-June 2017 journey.
If you believe in the greater potential of my trek, what I am trying to achieve and my future aspirations, then I would be so grateful for your support in making this trek possible.  
In return, for each level of support that you give, you receive a PERK. Essentially, a PERK is a gift from me as a HUGE THANK YOU for your support.
The PERKS you will receive include some of my most favourite photos that I have taken on my travels to date around Australia, North America, Europe and Asia. I have put together photographs that I believe portray these incredible places in the best way. I hope that when people view my work they can feel like they were there and experienced each moment. I know you will love my photographic work and I am really excited to be able to share my photos with you all. At the top is a video of my photographic work to date! You can also check out my photos here: https://www.instagram.com/curlycally/

We wondered why we shouldn’t just start with the people who love boutique hotels? Going down this path, we discovered that crowdfunding and crowdsourcing are actually great ways to develop a product made for the guest and by the guest. We instantly loved the idea.</p><p>We’ve launched this crowdfunding campaign to give you the chance to back the first ever crowdsourced boutique hotel.

So everyone who has backed us, and those who haven’t yet, will also benefit from this change. Future stays are valid year round, and this will mean savings of 82% as the rates in the summer are double than other times of the year. Indiegogo’s system will not let us update the perks, but where you have it in writing and will always be displayed in our campaign update page.Best wishes,Kristin & Marcus (Founders of Amberlair)     When we made the life-changing decision seven years ago to travel the world, we could not even imagine that the impact and inspiration would lead us to create Amberlair. Traveling to this extent gave us a new perspective, and exploration fueled our creativity. During our trip, we discovered that the most special and unique experiences were brought on by staying in smaller, independent hotels.We always thought it was a great idea to tap into the knowledge of like-minded travelers. We wondered why we shouldn’t just start with the people who love boutique hotels? Going down this path, we discovered that crowdfunding and crowdsourcing are actually great ways to develop a product made for the guest and by the guest. We instantly loved the idea.We’ve launched this crowdfunding campaign to give you the chance to back the first ever crowdsourced boutique hotel. After the campaign’s completion, we’ll be hard at work (with your input!) preparing for a very exciting grand opening in 2020. We’ll need help deciding on style, design and amenities – you won’t want to miss out!    Amberlair has a revolutionary approach to set up boutique hotels around the world. Through innovative use of crowdsourcing and social media, Amberlair brings together the global travel community and lets them have a say even before the hotels are built. Our community of backers - who we dearly address as #boholovers, meaning 'boutique hotel lovers' - are involved from day one, both creatively and financially.Even our name was crowdsourced, because one hundred minds work better than one. And guess what? Our community - YOU - has also chosen the location of the first Amberlair in Italy. With the help of our community, we are going to develop a historic villa in Puglia, Italy, and to turn it into the perfect boutique hotel.In many cases, people stay at hotels only once after finding rooms online and they do not have (or are interested in) a relationship with the brand. Amberlair creates potential lifelong guests, where people can get more involved with the brand and put their heart in the project.        In Puglia, the Amberlair team will be renovating historical buildings set within the plot— each offering a different room style— to create the first luxury boutique hotel in the region and give guests an experience they won’t find anywhere else.The current project allows for 60 rooms: 30 rooms in the historical villa, 10 rooms in a unique farmhouse building situated amidst olive groves and vineyards, 10 cave or spa rooms and 10 luxury tents.  
Spacious Rooftop Terraces
Aviary
SPA / Swimming Pool
Wedding destination with a famous pilgrim church within walking distance
Located between two crystal clear seas, the Ionian and the Adriatic
Within 20 minutes of pristine beaches
        Offering hotels for the people, by the people, Amberlair gives power back to the guests, allowing them to shape how a property will be used and what it will look like and to have the best boutique hotel experience imaginable. Backers can participate, interact, influence, support, back, fund or simply lay back and watch it happen from the very beginning.    Along the development process, that means until the hotel has opened its doors, the Amberlair will run various contests and brainstorming exercises where backers have the chance to submit their ideas and to vote on your favorite ones:
what should we do with the old birdhouse located in front of the villa? 
how shall the perfect bedroom be designed?
what does the perfect bathroom look like?
what does the perfect swimming pool look like?
what kind of activities would you prefer? Would it be cooking classes with a nona, series of sports activities (yoga, biking, etc.) or nothing at all?
      For the People, By the People: Our community of boutique hotel enthusiasts is steadily growing. We have more than 60 Amberlair ambassadors comprised of travel, lifestyle and luxury bloggers with a reach potential of 1.2 million on Twitter and 500k on Facebook.As the world’s first crowdsourced boutique hotel, we’ve gained coverage on high-profile outlets including Forbes, National Geographic, Luxury Branded, Boutique Hotel News, WTM Global Trends Report, as well as various well-known luxury travel blogs.    Although, we must confess that we have tried to keep it a secret and away from mainstream media for as long as we could, until now. Why? Because the surprise would be spoiled.Our community of boutique hotel enthusiasts who we dearly call #boholovers are involved from day one, both creatively and financially. Even our name was crowdsourced, because hundred minds work better than one.    “I feel really excited about Amberlair. It’s a hotel for the people, by the people and it’s going to revolutionize the way hotels are built and conceptualized.” “It is once in a lifetime experience and I love the idea. I am also looking forward to taking part in the crowdfunding part, as I really want to be one of the first guests staying at the hotel.” “It’s a brilliant concept, getting feedback from future guests and adapting the hotel in function of this, rather than launching a hotel and having to tweak it afterwards. Hopefully it’s the way of the future for hotels!”  ​“Amberlair is a fascinating concept. I’ll be curious to see how so many opinions from so many people can come together to create a cohesive project. If they pull it off, it could very well change the hospitality industry.” “I love the Amberlair concept. Such an innovative way to bring the travel community together. I can’t wait to see where the first location will be!” “I love the idea of crowdsourcing the perfect hotel. I think no one knows better than the travel community what would work best in a hotel and I’m excited to see what is created when we combine our efforts and ideas.”    The southeastern heel of the Italian boot, Puglia is rich in history, which we noticed right away in  its beautiful, ancient architecture and friendly people. We could almost see the Amberlair boutique hotel – your hotel – resting somewhere amidst a sea of olive trees and vineyards. Because Puglia offers world class wine and cuisine, fascinating cultural experiences and gorgeous scenery, we knew we had made the right choice.Our fantastic property in Puglia is remotely located between two seas - the Ionian and the Adriatic, and it is within easy reach of beaches, UNESCO world heritage sites and international airports (Bari and Brindisi).

It's 2017, and all the travel adapters on the market are still equipped with a single-use fuse that was invented in the 19th century.As a result, every time you go on a travel, there's a high chance that your travel adapter will fail because of the single-use fuse, and you could be one of the reviewers above. That's why we built Passport.When we began to work on this project two years ago, we simply wanted to resolve the single-use fuse problem so people don't need to worry about charging their devices while traveling.As our project went on, we found many other problems of the current travel adapters on the market, such as child safety issues, not enough USB outputs, and awkward two-handed operation. So we ended up making a truly worry-free ultimate universal travel adapter and charger. Auto-resetting fuses are commonly seen in the aerospace industry, but it’s never applied in travel adapters before due to cost and size.It took us a long time and hundreds of experiments to finally be able to customize the perfect auto-resetting fuse at the right cost and size for our product.Passport’s use of auto-resetting technology allows the device to recover from an overload on its own within just one minute, making it electronically unbreakable, and the most resilient travel adapter ever.It’s actually a mini switch with a built-in Bimetallic Thermal Sensor. It consists of two thermally different metals stuck together back to back. When it is cold the contacts are closed and current passes through the switch. When it gets hot, one metal expands more than the other and the bonded bi-metallic strip bends up, opening the contacts and preventing the current from flowing. The fuse can stand up to 10,000 reset cycles.Video Demonstration of Auto-Resetting Fuse

 
Thanks to its built-in all-in-one plugs and the universal AC output, Passport can work seamlessly in over 150 countries worldwide.Passport can plug into type A, B, C, D, E, F, G, I, J, K, L, N and O outlets.Passport can accept type A, B, C, E, F, G, I, J, K, L and N plugs.      According our research, most travel adapters on the market are not CE EMC certified for their USB charging electronics. Such devices can put out electromagnetic radiation that causes flickering screen or unstable behavior of your devices.  Note: images in the chart are to scale.   From the beginning, we wanted to design something that's world-class. So we partnered with Y Studios, an award-winning design firm based in San Francisco.

<h3>Summary</h3>
First of all, hi and welcome to The Accommodationer! <br/><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Let me introduce you to the project...</span><p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Accommodationer is a start up, aiming to offer to travelers an all-in-one marketplace to discover uniques local places and book great experiences and to local tourism experts, an incredible tourism marketing platform for promoting their products and their destination.</span></p>
<p>The idea behind the platform was born on the following bases:</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>1. We are Travelers:</b> we are frequent travelers and we love to discover new places enjoying original flavors, local culture and local traditions. </span></p>
Each time we plan a holidays by searching information on the internet,  we found outdated contents, misleading tips or generic guides. We see thousand of websites offering travel guides and information, mostly managed by marketing professionals with the only objective of driving traffic to their websites.<br/><br/><i>For this reason, we are designing an online solution where we can all find trusted information created by real local people, which identity is verified and confirmed.</i></span></span></span><br/><br/><p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>2.

<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">There are several different tools to promote tourism, however none is tailored to promote local destinations, local culture, traditions and incredible local environment.<br/></span></span></span></span><i style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/>With this in mind, we are developing a strong, powerful and flexible platform that offers all the dream tools needed to promote small and medium local tourism businesses.</i></p>

<p><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""></span></span></span></p>
<p>
Another objective we have, is to to give the control back to tourism experts over their destinations, lessening weight and importance from the big industry actors, which are earning huge amounts of money without investing in the territory, while profits will remain to local tourism experts and activities and reinvested in the territory.  We strongly believe in the “disintermediation”.</p>
<p>
<i>The Accommodationer will give local tourism experts easy-to-use tools to better understand travelers needs and desires and to travelers accurate information and tips to discover uniques places.</i></p>
<p><b>What differentiate The Accommodationer from the competition is <br/>the all-in-one solution with 360º tools to manage and promote local products and territory, </b>unlike modern booking platforms are doing.<br/><br/><b>

First of all, hi and welcome to The Accommodationer! Let me introduce you to the project...
The Accommodationer is a start up, aiming to offer to travelers an all-in-one marketplace to discover uniques local places and book great experiences and to local tourism experts, an incredible tourism marketing platform for promoting their products and their destination.
The idea behind the platform was born on the following bases:
1. We are Travelers: we are frequent travelers and we love to discover new places enjoying original flavors, local culture and local traditions. 
Each time we plan a holidays by searching information on the internet,  we found outdated contents, misleading tips or generic guides. We see thousand of websites offering travel guides and information, mostly managed by marketing professionals with the only objective of driving traffic to their websites.For this reason, we are designing an online solution where we can all find trusted information created by real local people, which identity is verified and confirmed.2. We are tourism Professionals: we've been working for years with property managers and tour operators and we perfectly know how they work and what are the industry challenges.
There are several different tools to promote tourism, however none is tailored to promote local destinations, local culture, traditions and incredible local environment.With this in mind, we are developing a strong, powerful and flexible platform that offers all the dream tools needed to promote small and medium local tourism businesses.
3. We are Locals: and we'd like a business model that reinvest revenues in the territory. 


Another objective we have, is to to give the control back to tourism experts over their destinations, lessening weight and importance from the big industry actors, which are earning huge amounts of money without investing in the territory, while profits will remain to local tourism experts and activities and reinvested in the territory.  We strongly believe in the “disintermediation”.

The Accommodationer will give local tourism experts easy-to-use tools to better understand travelers needs and desires and to travelers accurate information and tips to discover uniques places.
What differentiate The Accommodationer from the competition is the all-in-one solution with 360º tools to manage and promote local products and territory, unlike modern booking platforms are doing.
All our services will be free or, in some cases, at a very low rate, in order to help small and medium tourism companies to grow and obtain visibility in this highly competitive market within accessible costs.
The Accommodationer is more than a marketplace or a marketing tool. Travelers and tourism experts will be able to collaborate to improve and promote visibility and quality of less known touristic spots with history and traditions.

<p>While were here the lot is being maintained loosely by the previous owner, and as you can imagine we're itching to get to work on it. But we have lots to organise, including a leftover payment for the attached riverside lot, transporting not just the cats but the SERyGRAFÍA workshop et al.; as well as finding a way of ditching a particularly sticky rental contract in Santa Marta in exchange for Nerys' cousin's* little farmhouse beside the lot at the equivalent of £75p/m. </p>
<p>*That's how it is here.</p>
<p>The impatience is killing me. I can smell the dirt. We​ are on our way however, and​ have lots of trustworthy contacts here who are ​helping us, as well as a dear friend in Capurganá, co-owner of Capurganá's first hostel and property queen​, Nery​.</p>

<p>We'll be taking the not-immediately-necessary stuff over, with fingers crossed, at the start of April. ABOVE: Nery with Lau at the lot.</p>
<p>In terms of bureaucracy, visas, and other papers of all kinds we are prepared, having a wealth of experience over the last year with bureaucracy. ​My visa is in process after lots of frustrating official visits and signed papers around the country together with Lau.

<p>April will be an uncomfortable period of passing between Santa Marta back-and-forth. We will apply for necessary permits and finalise all the tedious paperwork in this month. We're going to keep everything as low cost as possible, esp. as paperwork is costing us already. We also will arrange the water and electricity services in April.</p>

Together, we can make our roads safer!</p><p> </p><p> </p></div>","The UltraDuo Z2 is the latest generation of our dual-lens dashboard camera that help you to drive with peace of mind and protect you and your car 24/7.    Whenever you’re driving out on the road, there is always a chance that you could get into a car accident. It could be anything from a rear-end collision caused by a distracted driver to a scratch or hit from a driver hurrying to back out of a parking lot. And, with so many factors, it can be difficult to place an insurance claim or provide footage that can be used in court when an accident happens. We understand the stress and worry. That’s why we’ve invented the UltraDuo Z2. With our unique take on the smart yet simple idea of a dashcam, we want to provide the solution to driving accountability, one car at a time.     With UltraDuo Z2 set up in your car, you can breathe easy. Our two-lens dashboard camera with loop recording and auto file protection provides you with tremendous peace of mind while driving. Because you can record two directions at once, it’s easy to make sure that the information you need is caught on camera!          Our UltraDuo Z2 has two 180-degree rotatable lenses. With their extreme mobility, you can point them any direction you want! They record simultaneously. The left lens is a 160-degree wide angle lens and the right lens is a telephoto zoom-in lens capable of recording distances up to 164 feet (50 meters). This is helpful whether you want to record the traffic around your car, or, in a commercial edition, if you want to record your conversations with your passengers.     It’s irritating when your camera doesn’t record vital information because it doesn’t have room to store it. Unlike action cameras, digital cameras, or regular video recorders, our Z2 doesn’t have a problem with memory capacity. Unfortunately, we didn’t invent an unlimited memory storage system. However, we did equip our Z2 with the next best thing! Loop recording enables the Z2 to automatically overwrite the oldest, non-protected video files with the latest video. This means the Z2 can keep recording, even if its memory becomes full!   The Hot Key functions were designed to protect both you as the driver and the other drivers on the road. These keys are positioned around the 2 inch LCD display of the Z2 and are clearly labeled for easy accessibility.1) The 'Mute' button stops and continues the sound recording feature on the Z2.2) The 'File Protection' button allows you to protect certain footage from the Z2’s loop recording feature so you can save important information.3) The 'EV Mode' button adjusts the exposure levels of both lenses from 0, which is the default setting, and gives you the exposure options of -1, -2, and +1, +2.       The Z2 is equipped with a 2 inch LCD screen so it’s easy to operate the camera, see what the camera’s recording in real time, and watch playback later.   Enabling parking mode allows the camera to turn on automatically if it detects any external force on the car. This function lets the Z2 record any potentially threatening actions, whether by vandalism or a distracted driver in a parking lot. The camera’s sensitivity is adjustable and will only activate when the camera and car are turned off . This function only works if the Z2’s internal battery has enough power. * Before you drive, simply connect the Z2 to your cigarette lighter outlet to charge the battery.      There are definitely moments in video footage that are more important than others, such as the moment of incident or impact. To ensure your vital files are saved, we added an auto file protection function to the Z2. Whenever the camera detects an external force on your car, the file protection feature will automatically lock the footage surrounding that moment, protecting it from being overwritten in the loop recording function.   The UltraDuo Z2 has two editions: standard and commercial. The standard edition features one wide angle lens and one telephoto lens. The commercial edition features two wide angle lenses.StandardThis edition is designed with general users in mind. It works great for daily commutes! Both lenses record simultaneously. The wide angle lens captures more up-close traffic and cars, while the telephoto lens records in a magnified way, to record objects that are farther way, like license plates, road obstructions, etc. Because both lenses are rotatable, you can record traffic ahead of you and behind you at the same time. No need to install two separate cameras – the Z2 is the only camera you need! CommercialThis edition is designed especially for taxi drivers or other professional drivers. If you have an unwanted passenger, being able to record and save footage of your driver-passenger interaction can help protect you by giving you control. This commercial edition has two wide angle lenses for professional drivers to easily record both traffic and driver-passenger interaction at the same time. This camera includes a microphone so you can record any conversations in your car.  Important note: If you use the Z2 or any other camera to record inside of your commercial vehicle, you must have a warning sticker on your car to inform your passengers that they are being recorded  Watch the videos below to see how well UltraDuo Z2’s image quality compares to other dashcams!  Note: Both editions come with a built-in microphone which you can turn on/off for voice recording.Remember to set the video quality to 1080P resolution by clicking the gear button at the bottom of the video screen to ensure you view the crystal-clear footage the Z2 can capture!

<h3>Yenokavan, a small village in Armenia</h3>
<p>Yell Extreme Park is located in Yenokavan village (Tavush region)- South to Yerevan, Capital of Armenia. It's two hour drive from Yerevan and two and half from Tbilisi, Capital of Georgia. Actually, the population of community is 612 people. Mostly, they are engaged in cattle and agriculture. Apaga Resort, which is also located in Yenokavan and Yell Extreme Park provide approximately 60 workplaces to the people living in community. During the last 10 years, stable tourism growth was recorded in the community, which led to the improvement of social conditions of the villagers. </p>
<p>The territory is mainly mountainous and rocky hillsides covered with a green carpet of Alpine meadows, which ensures perfect conditions for the development of eco and adventure tourism in Yenokavan. Tavush is sometimes reffered to us as a little Armenian Switzerland. </p>
<p>             <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493821372/eq56ktusvkl6jlfefh7a.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>  </p>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>As the first adventure park in Armenia, Yell Extreme Park gives an opportunity to do extreme sports without being a professional. It is located 142 km away from Yerevan and 158 km away from Tbilisi. Here we do our best to lighten up the world and live the moments with full enjoyment. The team of Yell Extreme Park has created an amazing opportunity for those who are searching for adventures and adrenaline.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482321032/xccy1md4dlwfdcvdk6fd.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/> </p>
<p>Our first Zip-line flight took place in July, 2015. A year later, in August 2016, the quantity of visitors surpassed 15.000. In that period, the activities were regularly accrued. Since November 2015, one can also experience paragliding or ride a bike in mountains. Next year two more Zip-lines were constructed. Now our longest line is 750m with the height of 200-300m and the speed of 5-7m/s.</p>
<p>New activities adjoined the park recently – people can try their forces in Paintball and Extreme Swing. If they love speed, they can join our Off-road tours or ride Yell track. There are also horseback riding tours in the nearest mountains lasting up to 7 days.</p>
<p>Now we are designing a <strong>new Zip-line with the length of 2680 m</strong> and the height of approximately 250 m. There will be 4 parallel Zip-lines from the place of Yell Extreme Park to the village of Yenokavan. We are going to set a new record of Guinness Records book and we want the highest <strong>Yell</strong> to be heard from the Yell Park. </p>
<p>           <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493810111/dwtqk38mf8ea7u8pubip.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>We are hungry for adventures and we all need to feel more</strong></h3>
<p>Every time we are planning our trips we want to discover new places and new emotions. The longest Zip-line will be an amazing chance to <i>change the world of adventure.</i></p>
<p>For many years in some mountainous countries the Zip-line has been used as a transportation method. Now Zip-line tours become popular vacation activities and one of the best adventure sports.</p>
<p>Zip-line allows the person to move from a certain location to the other with a cable extended between the two point at a certain distance. In reality, there are two primary forces that affect acceleration; one is due to the component of gravity in the direction of motion and the other is a combination of friction and other resistive forces.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493824112/dwi8w4fpxo4k25qbxbpy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Zip-line with the length of 2.7 km: </strong>The duration of flight will be maximum of 3 minutes and the speed of 120 km/h.</p>
<p><strong>The harness: </strong>The Super Ripper will allow to fly head first down and will keep safe.</p>
<p>Product description: Multiple adjustment points keep the rider balanced. Color coded safety straps make it easy to put on and off. Made from 5,000lb test mil-spec webbing and high strength quick adjust buckles with adjustable leg and shoulder straps keep the people locked in.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1482311247/kskfosn2lsgdqrx1zhpy.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Pricing: </strong>Individual fee for Longest Zip-line is $60. But if you get your ticket in advance via Indiegogo you will get 50% discount – one price for 2 tickets.  </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>To finish our project we need</strong></h3>
<p>$ 80-100,000 – We are designing 4 parallel lines.The overall length of the lines will be 12.000 meters. (1 meter costs 6.5$, 4 parallel lines, each for 3000 meters, (including taxes).</p>
<p>$ 10-15,000 – Harnesses for Zip-liners. </p>
<p>$ 25-30,000 – Construction costs.</p>

</div></div>","Yenokavan, a small village in Armenia
Yell Extreme Park is located in Yenokavan village (Tavush region)- South to Yerevan, Capital of Armenia. It's two hour drive from Yerevan and two and half from Tbilisi, Capital of Georgia. Actually, the population of community is 612 people. Mostly, they are engaged in cattle and agriculture. Apaga Resort, which is also located in Yenokavan and Yell Extreme Park provide approximately 60 workplaces to the people living in community. During the last 10 years, stable tourism growth was recorded in the community, which led to the improvement of social conditions of the villagers. 
The territory is mainly mountainous and rocky hillsides covered with a green carpet of Alpine meadows, which ensures perfect conditions for the development of eco and adventure tourism in Yenokavan. Tavush is sometimes reffered to us as a little Armenian Switzerland. 
               
Our Story
As the first adventure park in Armenia, Yell Extreme Park gives an opportunity to do extreme sports without being a professional. It is located 142 km away from Yerevan and 158 km away from Tbilisi. Here we do our best to lighten up the world and live the moments with full enjoyment. The team of Yell Extreme Park has created an amazing opportunity for those who are searching for adventures and adrenaline.
 
Our first Zip-line flight took place in July, 2015. A year later, in August 2016, the quantity of visitors surpassed 15.000. In that period, the activities were regularly accrued. Since November 2015, one can also experience paragliding or ride a bike in mountains. Next year two more Zip-lines were constructed. Now our longest line is 750m with the height of 200-300m and the speed of 5-7m/s.
New activities adjoined the park recently – people can try their forces in Paintball and Extreme Swing. If they love speed, they can join our Off-road tours or ride Yell track. There are also horseback riding tours in the nearest mountains lasting up to 7 days.
Now we are designing a new Zip-line with the length of 2680 m and the height of approximately 250 m. There will be 4 parallel Zip-lines from the place of Yell Extreme Park to the village of Yenokavan. We are going to set a new record of Guinness Records book and we want the highest Yell to be heard from the Yell Park. 
            
 
We are hungry for adventures and we all need to feel more
Every time we are planning our trips we want to discover new places and new emotions. The longest Zip-line will be an amazing chance to change the world of adventure.
For many years in some mountainous countries the Zip-line has been used as a transportation method. Now Zip-line tours become popular vacation activities and one of the best adventure sports.
Zip-line allows the person to move from a certain location to the other with a cable extended between the two point at a certain distance. In reality, there are two primary forces that affect acceleration; one is due to the component of gravity in the direction of motion and the other is a combination of friction and other resistive forces.

Zip-line with the length of 2.7 km: The duration of flight will be maximum of 3 minutes and the speed of 120 km/h.
The harness: The Super Ripper will allow to fly head first down and will keep safe.
Product description: Multiple adjustment points keep the rider balanced. Color coded safety straps make it easy to put on and off. Made from 5,000lb test mil-spec webbing and high strength quick adjust buckles with adjustable leg and shoulder straps keep the people locked in.

Pricing: Individual fee for Longest Zip-line is $60. But if you get your ticket in advance via Indiegogo you will get 50% discount – one price for 2 tickets.  
 
To finish our project we need
$ 80-100,000 – We are designing 4 parallel lines.The overall length of the lines will be 12.000 meters. (1 meter costs 6.5$, 4 parallel lines, each for 3000 meters, (including taxes).
$ 10-15,000 – Harnesses for Zip-liners. 
$ 25-30,000 – Construction costs.
If we don't reach our entire goal, we will build 2 parallel Zip-lines, instead of 4, which, in fact, will reduce the capacity of servicing simultaneous flights.

I would like to purchase a good mountain bike to attend the 5 day Peak to Peak
Pedal Race (Big Bear Peak to Mammoth Peak on October 2014) and raise donations
for disabled kids (and kids at heart) via United States Adaptive Recreation
Center (http://usarc.org/).
The 5 day mountain bike
race is organized by U.S. Adaptive Recreation Center. This winter, I volunteer
at USARC as a ski instructor for visually impaired skiers. 
The United States
Adaptive Recreation Center, previously known as California Handicapped Skiers,
was founded to ensure access to skiing to people with all types of
disabilities. In 1993 the organization started the adaptive watersports and
summer camping programs in addition to on-site adaptive ski school in Big Bear.

What am I going to buy
with your donation?
I will buy Saphire  (a Specialized brand)
bike from Derek Hermon of Bear Valley Bikes. If I don’t raise the entire
amount, I will purchase a lower model bike for the amount I raised by April
2014.
Who am I?
I have recently competed at a fitness competition where I prepared for 5
months. During the process, I learned the fundamentals of losing weight and
improving my health and eating habits. I would love to share that information with
as many people as possible. You can see the details of my eating plan on my
blog. If you want to live my lifestyle for 2-4 days, come and be my guest at
Big Bear cabin and eat with me, do the grocery shopping with me, workout with
me and enjoy the magical Big Bear.

<h3>WHO AM I???</h3>
<p>My name is Lexie Wilson and i am currently a freshmen at Vanguard University. I am studying Pastoral Leadership in hopes of one day opening an Outdoor Adventure Camp where people would come to learn about the love of Christ through outdoor experiences and adventures. While preparing myself for this camp and everything that I will be faced with after graduating, i am dedicated to serve God wherever he calls me and wants me to be a light for him. I have a heart to serve Gods people and show love to everyone in our world. I believe everyone deserves to know that they are truly loved by a God who sent his son for our lives. I believe everyone deserves to know that they matter in this world, in Gods Kingdom. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>WHY I NEED YOUR HELP!</h3>
<p>Vanguard has multiple Outreach programs within the school. The outreach program that I am trying to raise money for is called SFO. This spring break i will be spending my time in San Francisco with this team serving the homeless in the slums of San Francisco. I need to raise a total of $500 dollars before March 1 in order to be a part of such a wonderful program. The funds that i raise will be the only way i can be a part of this team. The money will be going towards my travel, hotel, and food for our team as well as the homeless we will be serving. The trip is from March 16-23. The team will be bussed from Vanguard University in Costa Mesa, CA to San Francisco CA. We will be spending a week there serving the homeless, going to shelters, and building relationship with people of the city. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>THE IMPACT.</h3>
<p>The truth is that their are a lot of people in our very own country who have lost their homes, who are in need of the simple things that we need to survive, to simply put it, who just need love. San Francisco is a city that desperately needs to know the Love of Christ and like many other places in our world are very broken. My heart breaks for people with families who must sleep on the cold concrete due to the loss of a job. Your support will help me go along with a team that is going to bring our serving hearts and hands for these people to let them know how loved they are. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>MONEY AIN'T EVERYTHING!</h3>
<p>If you feel like you just are not able to help me financially right now, that is complelety OK! I understand that right now the economy is rough and as much as i need the money i understand if that is just not possible for you and your family to help support in that way right now. However, you can contribute and help me in a different way. </p>
<p>I would appreciate your prayers for this trip, our team, the people we will be coming in contact with, and for my own personal growth through this mission. </p>
<p>The power of Prayer blows me away. God hears all of our requests and wants to watch over his children. YOUR PRAYERS ARE SO IMPORTANT AND APPRECIATED! </p>

Oh yeah. We will also develop apps for the smartwatch users out there, so you can control your suitcase right from your wrist and be the ultimate travel baller.

<h3>The best way to tie down your load!</h3>
<h3>Ratchet tie-down straps have been loved yet reviled for decades as they jam, confuse, and frustrate the user. Problem solved! </h3>
<p>OmegaStrap is the world’s first ergonomic ratchet strap system. It features a hand-friendly control knob, a flexible fastener to hold your hook in place, and an elastic loop for easy storage. The OmegaStrap makes all other ratchet straps in its weight-class archaic.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Common Ratchet Strap Problems... <strong><u>OmegaStrap Solutions!</u></strong>
</h3>
<p>Buckles/straps that jam... <strong>Knob turns them out             </strong>                        </p>
<p>Hooks that fall loose... <strong>Flex hook holds almost anywhere</strong></p>
<p>Dangling strap tails... <strong>Knob receives excess length</strong></p>
<p>Tangled straps … <strong>Elastic loop stores strap</strong></p>
<p>Loading confusion ...<strong>Knob makes it easy</strong></p>
<p>Uncontrolled ratchet release ... <strong>Knob gives control</strong></p>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Background on OmegaStrap:</h3>
</div>
<p>Frustrated by recurring bad experiences with regular ratchet straps, it became my mission to improve them. Over the past 4 years I have worked to redesign the common ratchet strap and get it produced. Finally, the first production run of OmegaStrap has begun. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>It's tough! It's rugged! It's good looking! It's smart! It's you!</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>How OmegaStrap is different:</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>The Control Knob!</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">A knob was added to create an ever-present device that could be used to clear jammed straps and stuck axles. Once the knob was present, it revealed that the buckle's axle could be engineered to be turned backwards while closed. <u>This is really important! </u> This feature allows the axle to be rotated by hand until it locks in-line for easy and proper loading of the strap into the ratchet buckle. The metal will even be stamped with loading directions!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605719110/ryc1ccwjturf3jygmt92.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""> </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>The Flexible Hook!</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Hooks repeatedly dropping loose from their remote anchor points led to the creation of a flexible wire assembly. The wire allows retention of the hook even in the most difficult places. </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603849711/hpbb7v9g1vwavjaelei4.jpg"" src=""""/></p> <p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>The Elastic Loop!</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The addition of an attached elastic band solved the problem of tying off the excess strap as well as neatly storing the tie-down. When traveling, simply wrap the excess around the knob and secure it with the storage loop. When you are finished, just wrap the strap up and loop it.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:80px;"">Chuck R. (Engineer) <strong> </strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>""Genius. Simple. Finally. Three words that sum up the OmegaStrap. If you have ever had a dirt bike fall over in the back of your truck when you release the strap, or been forced to lose time re-hooking or un-jamming, the damage doesn't go away and you never get that time back. This product will not only help your blood pressure, but it will save you time and money."" </strong></p>

<p style=""margin-left:80px;"">Max (Boxstore Hardware Manager)  </p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Most straps today are sold in a very heavy plastic, single-use container that goes into landfills and may last forever. They also make it very difficult to remove the product. It shouldn't require 10 minutes and all of your wits and strength to get them out of the packaging. If you can get them out that is!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Our packaging will be a more simple paper and soy-based style that is more carbon-neutral and easy to recycle. </strong></p>

The best way to tie down your load!
Ratchet tie-down straps have been loved yet reviled for decades as they jam, confuse, and frustrate the user. Problem solved! 
OmegaStrap is the world’s first ergonomic ratchet strap system. It features a hand-friendly control knob, a flexible fastener to hold your hook in place, and an elastic loop for easy storage. The OmegaStrap makes all other ratchet straps in its weight-class archaic.
 
Common Ratchet Strap Problems... OmegaStrap Solutions!

Buckles/straps that jam... Knob turns them out                                     
Hooks that fall loose... Flex hook holds almost anywhere
Dangling strap tails... Knob receives excess length
Tangled straps … Elastic loop stores strap
Loading confusion ...Knob makes it easy
Uncontrolled ratchet release ... Knob gives control

 
Background on OmegaStrap:

Frustrated by recurring bad experiences with regular ratchet straps, it became my mission to improve them. Over the past 4 years I have worked to redesign the common ratchet strap and get it produced. Finally, the first production run of OmegaStrap has begun. 
 
It's tough! It's rugged! It's good looking! It's smart! It's you!
 
How OmegaStrap is different:
The Control Knob!
A knob was added to create an ever-present device that could be used to clear jammed straps and stuck axles. Once the knob was present, it revealed that the buckle's axle could be engineered to be turned backwards while closed. This is really important!  This feature allows the axle to be rotated by hand until it locks in-line for easy and proper loading of the strap into the ratchet buckle. The metal will even be stamped with loading directions!

 
The Flexible Hook!
Hooks repeatedly dropping loose from their remote anchor points led to the creation of a flexible wire assembly. The wire allows retention of the hook even in the most difficult places. 
 The Elastic Loop!
The addition of an attached elastic band solved the problem of tying off the excess strap as well as neatly storing the tie-down. When traveling, simply wrap the excess around the knob and secure it with the storage loop. When you are finished, just wrap the strap up and loop it.


 
What OmegaStrap Enthusiasts Have to Say:
""Elegantly simple.""
Chuck R. (Engineer)  
""Genius. Simple. Finally. Three words that sum up the OmegaStrap. If you have ever had a dirt bike fall over in the back of your truck when you release the strap, or been forced to lose time re-hooking or un-jamming, the damage doesn't go away and you never get that time back. This product will not only help your blood pressure, but it will save you time and money."" 
Tyler F. (Lawn and landscape company manager)  
""I need more straps, but won't buy them until yours are out.""
Max (Boxstore Hardware Manager)  
These straps are genius! After many years of ATVing these look like they would solve a lot of the issues of traditional straps. I have shared it with 3 ATV groups already. Good luck, hope you do well!
Warren W. (Motorsports entusiast)  
 
Our campaign goal:
Your investment made here will help us overcome the next hurdle: Sales history. Having a strong sales history translates to retailer interest. Contributing not only puts some of the straps into your hands, but also helps this product succeed! 
We are asking you to participate! Put a pair in your tool chest. You'll feel like a pro as you tie down your cargo with speed and confidence.
 
The Impact of Contributions, and The Future:

We want to reduce the excess waste in ratchet strap packaging. 
Most straps today are sold in a very heavy plastic, single-use container that goes into landfills and may last forever. They also make it very difficult to remove the product. It shouldn't require 10 minutes and all of your wits and strength to get them out of the packaging. If you can get them out that is!
Our packaging will be a more simple paper and soy-based style that is more carbon-neutral and easy to recycle.

We’ve already working on an idea collected from our community - a cycling light with directional signals!     This is just one of the many awesome suggestions we’ve receive and we want to invite you to share your creative ideas to take the Fiets & Fiets to the next level.  The Fiets & Fiets backpack is made from PU materials. It is waterproof, stain-proof, lightweight, and offers optimal heat dissipation.

By doing so, it can take away any unbalanced pressure weighing down your shoulders when you’re cycling or hiking.   Instead of the traditional zipper, the magnetic enclosure offers quick and easy access to your items while you’re on-the-go. The magnetic seal with Fidlock securely fastens the flap onto the backpack safeguarding your items in seconds.  The patented lock, Fidlock, is convenient, protective, and reliable.

When you’re done, roll the other end of the string around the middle finger of the same hand that holds the Holl. Keep the Holl with anchor point facing upwards, position yourself, and throw it. That’s how easy it is    Holl will brighten your day. With Holl, you will never be bored. You can play and organize competitions with your friends and family members anywhere and anytime. Think out of the box and improvise with Holl.    If you are still thinking to get armed with a new toy, you are on the right track. Holl will be your inseparable friend everywhere.Good News!! We are on our last stage of the project. The production and design processes  are completely finished. At this stage, we are packing Holls to dispatch.   We promise you’ll get HOL before Christmas.",25.0,0,"1 Campaign

10,000 km is a project that I dreamt to do for years, on September 2014 I finally managed to set my work schedule, sold my car and a few other things, got all the photo equipment and set off for this great journey. 
This project is a photographic collection of some of the most amazing landscapes in Venezuela, I will show you the great diversity of natural wonders that our country  has to offer hoping to inspire some of you to visit us and see it for yourselves.

I'm offering to all the contributors an exclusive limited set of large high quality prints, and an E-Book option as well.
Please check the list of Perks I have created for you and I hope you enjoy them. I will constantly post updates to keep you informed, motivated and excited. Stay tuned and as always, please spread the word.

<p><b>(Timothy) 3 Year old CEO .. Is the reason InstaKnot was developed. Now we are sharing the InstaKnot concept with YOU !!</b><br/></p>
<p>I wanted to duplicate the Jennifer Aniston’s GQ Magazine cover when she wore the Tie only. So I took Timpthy to Sears photo studio, after his first out fit, I changed him into the next out fit (Tie and diaper). Then I realize I did not know, “ how to tie a tie knot”. The manager, Mercedes assisted me and the photos came out great. Few weeks later after speaking to several people, I found lots of people including men have the same issue, so I was no longer felt ashamed to admit I can not tie a tie knot. (but wait , I still do not knot how to tie a tie – but I can attach the InstaKnot for Traditional or Mix N Match Look on a Tie! </p>
<p>Even if you know how to make a Tie Knot, you can try it for the Mix n Match unique feature or our Special Occasion InstaKnot for a unique look or the Traditional option if you just don't want to tie a tie knot each time.</p>

 InstaKnot – Tie is totally SEPARATE from Tie Knot.  ---  
Eg: A Red & Grey Tie with Red Tie Knot for unique, Mix N Match Option (see BELOW example)
Your Modern Day Solution for Tying a Tie Knot.  It can be MIX N Match for a unique look or Same color for Traditional look.  (InstaKnot, does not replace traditional ties).

(All decesions will be made by Marcia VP/ Designer until the 3 Year old CEO grows up)




(Timothy) 3 Year old CEO .. Is the reason InstaKnot was developed. Now we are sharing the InstaKnot concept with YOU !!
I wanted to duplicate the Jennifer Aniston’s GQ Magazine cover when she wore the Tie only. So I took Timpthy to Sears photo studio, after his first out fit, I changed him into the next out fit (Tie and diaper). Then I realize I did not know, “ how to tie a tie knot”. The manager, Mercedes assisted me and the photos came out great. Few weeks later after speaking to several people, I found lots of people including men have the same issue, so I was no longer felt ashamed to admit I can not tie a tie knot. (but wait , I still do not knot how to tie a tie – but I can attach the InstaKnot for Traditional or Mix N Match Look on a Tie! 
Even if you know how to make a Tie Knot, you can try it for the Mix n Match unique feature or our Special Occasion InstaKnot for a unique look or the Traditional option if you just don't want to tie a tie knot each time.

<h2>Our Story</h2>
</div>
<p>Our vision is to provide a solution to the prevalence of theft and robbery to ensure that when out on the go, both YOU and your belongings are safe and protected. While some manufacturers have undertaken a few anti-theft measures, they all fall short of preventing theft of the bag in its entirety, not to mention protection of the bag wearer them self.  </p>
<p>At this current time, we are integrating a BALLISTIC UPGRADE to the already revolutionary Eversafe backpack.  </p>
<p>The ballistic upgrade adds 1lb to the backpack’s total weight and is a stand-alone armor plate with multiple hit capability that is rated for up to five hits from a .44 magnum bullet and can withstand multiple hits from all pistol calibers. </p>
<h3>The Impact </h3>
<p>Safety and protection are at the forefront of our goal. Tragedy seems to strike daily, and places high in tourism are at stake.  </p>
<p>With the rise in burglaries, theft and mass gun shootings, we hope to achieve peace of mind for our consumers. We are striving to provide a product that, above all else, offers peace of mind. </p>

<p> This is a product that I have been wanting to produce and make for sale to the public for quite some time.

I beleive in the product in both viability and usefulness.</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p> In order to produce a larger volume of the fishing pole I need to aquire all the components that are not fabricated in house, including motors, electronic components, PCB boards and misc hardware. The larger quantity that I can buy, the lower the cost. I want to buy supplies for 200 units to start, which give a fantastic quantity price break, and a better margin of profits from the final product.</p>
<p> The printed circuit boards will be fabricated from from a board house, and the gerber files and artwork is done, with a run of ten boards tested, verfiyed and working. The components are all readily availible and in stock from supplyers. Each PCB cost about 3.50 in lots of ten, and 2$ in 100 lots.</p>
<p>The cases are fabricated by me at my shop. They are produced from lexan and resin castings. Funding will pay for resin only-the lexan I already have on hand and have begun cutting to size.</p>
<p> If my funding goals can not be met, I will slowly make up the difference on my own, which will take longer, but this product is worth it. I hope to build and sell the first lot and make more than enough to farm out some of the work and create a job or two for others, and continue to make more units for sale.</p>
<p> The product will retail from between 30$ for the kit(DIY delight!) or 49$ ready to go with some free lures. Many folks who expressed interest in purchasing a fishing pole wanted to build it from a kit, so I am making this an option.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> It might sound strange, but I never really liked fishing. In fact I do most of my fishing in the isles of a grocery store. But when I went out to test the pole, an amazing thing happened-I enjoyed the day(s). I even got sunburned staying out enjoying it too much. And I caught a few fish. I let the pole move the bait-It can troll, reel in and out with the flick of a switch. And it gives you something to do and fool with in addition to fishing, and waiting. Its fun. Its a gadget that is useful and serves a purpose.</p>
<p> Most things I made in the past were short run, tech stuff for dedicated hobbyists. This is a mass appeal item, that people have already expressed an desire to have me make. I went through the pains of productionizing it so it can be manageably built, and now it is ready.</p>

<p>Bikeboards are a patent pending product created by a group of people who are tired of putting their bikes away for winter and want to ride their bikes in the snow.</p>
<p>A bikeboard is a bike accessory that attaches to the tire and allows you to ride your bike in snow.  Bikeboards can be carried in your backpack as you ride until you get to snowy conditions. Bikeboards can be used touring, backcountry, or in snow parks. Ride with a single board on the front and pedal for crosscountry riding or have a great adventure riding downslope with 2 boards, one on front and one on back.  What makes bikeboards great is that they are quick and easy to use on your own bike. You just pop the tire into the boot, and they are adjustable to fit any bike tire from a BMX to Fatbike. It's the creation of a new seasonal crossover product so you no longer have to put your bike away for winter. For cyclists who need to keep up their training getting out in the winter with the bikeboards is great for your endurance.  You also do not have to modify your bike.  This is not a conversion kit. Our product lets a bike remain a bike. When you are finished riding on the snow pull the tire out of the boot, put the bikeboards in a backpack and continue on your journey. </p>
<p>Your first time riding you will remember what it was like to first ride your bike as you're thinking, ""I'm doing it! I'm really doing it!""  It's all about a having a good time and fun.</p>
<p>Our vision is to see cyclists across the U.S. and worldwide enjoying their bikes year around, proving that cycling is also a winter sport, taking bikes on greater adventures.  We want to see bikeboards expand the opportunities for biking, with new races, challenges and events.</p>
<p>Our group is based out of Colorado.  Currently we are using our own proprietary parts and repurposed snow blades, but are working on our own custom ski that will be made in New York.  All of our other parts are built in Colorado.</p>

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">What We're Trying to Achieve</span><br/>
</h3> <p>Every other year, hundreds of youth players send in applications to participate in tryouts for the U-19 National Teams. In the end, less than 50 players are selected based on their ability to play at the highest level. Unfortunately, sometimes these players have to make the choice not to attend the most prestigious event in the world due to cost. We want to take that factor out of the decision for every player that needs it.</p> <ul>
<li>My name is Julia Lee - I work at USA Ultimate and have been helping our National Teams with fundraising for the past few years. As I have gotten to know these players, I have made it my goal to help them in any way that I can.</li> <li>To start, we encouraged the players to run fundraising efforts on their own in their own communities. After they went through that process, we asked them to evaluate if they needed help from USA Ultimate and the larger ultimate community. All money raised as part of this campaign goes directly to those players who asked for support.</li> <li>Your gift means so much to these players who are only asking to play. For more information about both teams (boys and girls), please visit their website (<a href=""http://www.usaultimate.org/about/usaultimate/international/wjuc_2014.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><b>2014 U-19 US National Teams</b></a>). </li>
<li>We'll also be showcasing individual players on both teams over the next 2 weeks during the campaign. We'll  post them as updates to the campaign so check out that tab to learn more about the awesome, goofy, friendly players that will be representing the US in Italy!</li>
</ul><p></p> <p> </p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We've broken down the levels for costs and perks into how much various parts of the trip will cost for each player, including food, housing and transportation both at training camp at Manhattan College in Riverdale, NY (July 13-18) and at the tournament itself in Lecco, Italy (July 19-27). There are even more costs that add up too, but we wanted to highlight some of the main financial burdens that these players face.</p><p></p><p>Here is a list of the costs:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">$25 - Shuttle to and from the airport for training camp, as well as additional transportation as needed during the week.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">$50 - Shuttle to and from the airport at the World Junior Ultimate Championships in Italy (Milan to Lecco and back). Fortunately, shuttle service to and from the fields during the tournament are included as part of individual player fees (112 Euros each or about $150 USD).</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">$100 - Meals in the dorms during training camp.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">$200 - Housing in the dorms during training camp.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">$300 - Housing in the dorms during the World Junior Ultimate Championships (30 Euros per night for 8 nights - at the current exchange rate, that's about $38  USD per night).</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">$500 - Flight to training camp in Riverdale, NY and then back home after the World Junior Ultimate Championships (average cost for airfare per player, depending on their location).</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">$1,500 - Flight to and from the World Junior Ultimate Championships in Lecco, Italy (the teams are flying directly from training camp in New York to Milan, the closest airport to the tournament).</span></li>
</ul><p>Fortunately, we have great sponsors like Five Ultimate who supplies the players and coaches with jerseys, shorts, warm ups and more! We cannot thank them enough for all of their support! We also want to give a huge thank you to our affiliate, DiscNY, for their help securing and paying for the fields that the teams will be using in NYC during training camp! One less cost on a list of many.</p><p>Here is a list of our perks:</p><ul>

In the end, less than 50 players are selected based on their ability to play at the highest level. Unfortunately, sometimes these players have to make the choice not to attend the most prestigious event in the world due to cost. We want to take that factor out of the decision for every player that needs it. 
My name is Julia Lee - I work at USA Ultimate and have been helping our National Teams with fundraising for the past few years. As I have gotten to know these players, I have made it my goal to help them in any way that I can. To start, we encouraged the players to run fundraising efforts on their own in their own communities. After they went through that process, we asked them to evaluate if they needed help from USA Ultimate and the larger ultimate community. All money raised as part of this campaign goes directly to those players who asked for support. Your gift means so much to these players who are only asking to play. For more information about both teams (boys and girls), please visit their website (2014 U-19 US National Teams). 
We'll also be showcasing individual players on both teams over the next 2 weeks during the campaign. We'll  post them as updates to the campaign so check out that tab to learn more about the awesome, goofy, friendly players that will be representing the US in Italy!
  What We Need & What You Get We've broken down the levels for costs and perks into how much various parts of the trip will cost for each player, including food, housing and transportation both at training camp at Manhattan College in Riverdale, NY (July 13-18) and at the tournament itself in Lecco, Italy (July 19-27). There are even more costs that add up too, but we wanted to highlight some of the main financial burdens that these players face.Here is a list of the costs:

$25 - Shuttle to and from the airport for training camp, as well as additional transportation as needed during the week.


$50 - Shuttle to and from the airport at the World Junior Ultimate Championships in Italy (Milan to Lecco and back). Fortunately, shuttle service to and from the fields during the tournament are included as part of individual player fees (112 Euros each or about $150 USD).


$100 - Meals in the dorms during training camp.


$200 - Housing in the dorms during training camp.


$300 - Housing in the dorms during the World Junior Ultimate Championships (30 Euros per night for 8 nights - at the current exchange rate, that's about $38  USD per night).


$500 - Flight to training camp in Riverdale, NY and then back home after the World Junior Ultimate Championships (average cost for airfare per player, depending on their location).

$1,500 - Flight to and from the World Junior Ultimate Championships in Lecco, Italy (the teams are flying directly from training camp in New York to Milan, the closest airport to the tournament).
Fortunately, we have great sponsors like Five Ultimate who supplies the players and coaches with jerseys, shorts, warm ups and more! We cannot thank them enough for all of their support! We also want to give a huge thank you to our affiliate, DiscNY, for their help securing and paying for the fields that the teams will be using in NYC during training camp! One less cost on a list of many.Here is a list of our perks:
$25 Level - National Team prize pack

<p>Canoes are a great way to enjoy the outdoors from a unique vantage point - on your own, with a friend, or with your dogs. Unfortunately, canoes can be hard to transport and store, simply because of their size.</p>
<p>MyCanoe POP solves for that. It is a two-person, 50-pound, 14-foot canoe that folds and unfolds like origami in a matter of minutes. It comes with two seats and a carrying case, which doubles as the canoe floor.</p>

<p>Intense research, planning, testing and design went into POP and it’s carrying case. The case itself becomes the canoe’s floor, adding structural support.</p>

<p>Q. How do I care for MyCanoe POP?</p>
<p>A. We recommend treating your MyCanoe POP as you would a fiberglass, wood, or skin-on-frame canoe: don’t drag it or bump into sharp things, store out of direct sunlight, and rinse the canoe thoroughly with fresh water after each use.</p>
<p>Q. How stable is a MyCanoe POP?</p>
<p>A. MyCanoe POP is quite stable and difficult to capsize. However, we recommend that inexperienced paddlers go with a companion, and don't attempt to use POP in conditions beyond their skill level.</p>
<p>Q. Does POP float?</p>
<p>A. Yes, the POP is buoyant and will float even if it capsizes. However, we recommend taking every safety precaution, including personal flotation devices and equipping bow and stern with floating bags.</p>
<p>Q. Will repeated folding weaken the hull?</p>
<p>A. The body of POP is manufacturer rated for 20,000 fold cycles - that's a lot of folds!</p>
<p>Q. Can I take POP on a plane?</p>
<p>A. Yes, POP can be checked as luggage, and the best way to protect POP during transport is to cover with a protective material (e.g. blanket).</p>
<p>Q. Can It Be Used For Fishing?</p>
<p>A. Yes. With minor modifications POP can be outfitted with a rod holder. Another great choice for outfitting your POP is with one of RAM's mounts— RAM Mounts makes a Tough Claw, that works perfectly on the POP. Clamps down tight without drilling any holes, and you can then attach a rod holder, or cup holder,camera mount, fish finder, etc. The RAM Mount can then be paired with a YakAttack or RAM rod holder. We recommend a stabilizer kit for added stability when fishing.</p>
<p>Q. Can I attach a trolling motor to the MyCanoe POP?</p>
<p>A. Yes. We recommend a small lightweight motor to properly protect the hull and gunwales from damage. You will need either a DIY mount (e.g., see YouTube) or buy one from online - search for ""Canoe trolling motor mount"".</p>
<p>Q. Can I take MyCanoe POP in salt water?</p>
<p>A. Salt water will not damage POP. Just make sure to rinse the inside and outside of the hull, all joints, parts and accessories after each use. Dry before folding.</p>
<p>Q. What if I hit a rock?</p>
<p>A. Avoid rocks. However, if you do hit one, you and your POP should be fine. We’ve tested it on rocky beaches and even attempted to crack the hull with a hammer.</p>
<p>Q. What if I made a hole?</p>
<p>A. While the hull is extremely durable and unlikely to get a hole, if that happened, simply contact us for a free repair kit.</p>
<p>Q. Can I store MyCanoe POP as assembled for an extended period?</p>
<p>A. Yes. POP can be stored either assembled or folded for months. Just avoid direct sun exposure and store in dry, cool storage space.</p>
<p>Q. Can I setup sailing rig with MyCanoe POP?</p>
<p>A. Yes. As long as you can find correct hardware (clamps, support, hooks, etc.), MyCanoe should be fun with a light sailing set up.</p>
<p>Q. What are the buckles &amp; straps on the inside of canoe for?</p>
<p>A. You need to buckle them to give a proper tension and shape of canoe.</p>
<p>Q. Are there different colors to choose from?</p>
<p>A. No. MyCanoe POP will be available with only one color - white w/ aqua blue print.</p>
<p>Q. Does paddle float?</p>
<p>A. Yes, MyCanoe paddles are buoyant and will float.</p>
<p>Q. How do I attach stabilizers and rowing kit?</p>
<p>A. Your package will have instructions and we will have videos in near future.</p>

A. Yes, POP can be checked as luggage, and the best way to protect POP during transport is to cover with a protective material (e.g. blanket).
Q. Can It Be Used For Fishing?
A. Yes. With minor modifications POP can be outfitted with a rod holder. Another great choice for outfitting your POP is with one of RAM's mounts— RAM Mounts makes a Tough Claw, that works perfectly on the POP. Clamps down tight without drilling any holes, and you can then attach a rod holder, or cup holder,camera mount, fish finder, etc. The RAM Mount can then be paired with a YakAttack or RAM rod holder. We recommend a stabilizer kit for added stability when fishing.
Q. Can I attach a trolling motor to the MyCanoe POP?
A. Yes. We recommend a small lightweight motor to properly protect the hull and gunwales from damage. You will need either a DIY mount (e.g., see YouTube) or buy one from online - search for ""Canoe trolling motor mount"".
Q. Can I take MyCanoe POP in salt water?
A. Salt water will not damage POP. Just make sure to rinse the inside and outside of the hull, all joints, parts and accessories after each use. Dry before folding.
Q. What if I hit a rock?
A. Avoid rocks. However, if you do hit one, you and your POP should be fine. We’ve tested it on rocky beaches and even attempted to crack the hull with a hammer.
Q. What if I made a hole?
A. While the hull is extremely durable and unlikely to get a hole, if that happened, simply contact us for a free repair kit.
Q. Can I store MyCanoe POP as assembled for an extended period?
A. Yes. POP can be stored either assembled or folded for months. Just avoid direct sun exposure and store in dry, cool storage space.
Q. Can I setup sailing rig with MyCanoe POP?
A. Yes. As long as you can find correct hardware (clamps, support, hooks, etc.), MyCanoe should be fun with a light sailing set up.
Q. What are the buckles & straps on the inside of canoe for?
A. You need to buckle them to give a proper tension and shape of canoe.
Q. Are there different colors to choose from?
A. No. MyCanoe POP will be available with only one color - white w/ aqua blue print.
Q. Does paddle float?
A. Yes, MyCanoe paddles are buoyant and will float.
Q. How do I attach stabilizers and rowing kit?
A. Your package will have instructions and we will have videos in near future.

<h3>Lets Bring the kingdom together!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We are a passionate group of young people also known as 'the A team' from Discovery Church who have the call of God on our lives to go on a two week mission trip to India in January 2014, for the purpose of spreading the gospel and bringing the Kingdom of God to earth.</p>
<p>We have been praying and participating in training together in different aspects of using our spiritual gifts, including prophesy, testimony and soaking in the presence of God for the purpose of being able to overflow with the Holy Spirit and see many people baptized in the spirit and have real encounters with God. We will be travelling to villages and cities around the south of India as a team, partnering with local pastors through an outreach ministry called C.O.M (Christian Outreach Ministries).  </p>
<p>We would love you to join with us in making this happen, by donating to our cause generously, as we cant do it on our own, but in partnership with others and with God, anything is possible. We need the money simply to pay for the expenses of the trip, as not all of us are in a place to support ourselves, but together we feel that we can really make a difference in the lives of the many people we will be ministering to, and the value of each person being there is paramount. It will go directly into a trip account, with every bit of it contributing to things such as accommodation, food and travel expenses.</p>
<p>You can also help by praying for us, which would be amazing, that God would go with us and that we would be protected and supported both in the lead up to the trip and while we are away.</p>
<p>Thankyou so much for getting on-board and being involved in something that is so much bigger and more important than we can even imagine, I'm confident that you will be blessed because of it.</p>

Development
We started from scratch, we studied and iterated the project till perfection. And finally we brought our dream all the way to the other side of the world, at the site for mass production engineering.

Now everything’s done: the molds are ready and tested, and 360lock is about to take off! We are ready to launch the production.

Coming soon extension module

The project will be empowered with a further extension module. The LTE alarm module will guarantee an higher safety standard due to its movement detection system and GPS. As soon as any hacking attempt comes, the module will send an alert by the SIM Card to the mobile numbers put in the app. The module will be also provided with a loud alarm system to discourage robbers.

Close to 3000 backers rooted for it to succeed. This high demand and overwhelming support validated that Wool &amp; Oak offered a product that travelers around the world want and need.</p><p>Wool &amp; Oak is a lifestyle brand specializing in leather travel goods. As a company born through crowdfunding, Wool &amp; Oak thrives to deliver meaningful innovation to stagnant product categories. The brand’s design philosophy is about the marriage of classic design aesthetic with maximum functionality needed in today’s modern world.</p><p>Founded in 2015 by Johnathan Webster, in his studio apartment in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, Wool &amp; Oak separates itself from other brands by offering extremely well made products at a price point that represents aspiration- a step above fast fashion quality and a step below luxury price. Wool &amp; Oak is also unique because the founder, Johnathan Webster, was formally trained in fashion design in Rome, Italy. This brand was founded by an actual designer.</p><h1><b>Meet The Team </b></h1><div data-id=""14239751""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1482261541/jpqmsooh9oln6fmyrgsw.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><div data-id=""14255681""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""> </figure></div><p><a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/574115111/the-leather-duffle-backpack-6-in-1-set-zip-pack-go/pledge/new?clicked_reward=false"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> </a></p><h1> Thank you for your support!</h1><div>The reason we exist and can create beautifully made bags is because of your support and excitement for our vision!<br/><br/> <h2>Risks, Challenges &amp; Policy</h2>
<p>This is Wool &amp; Oak’s second crowdfunding campaign. Our first campaign, “The World’s First Duffle Suitcase”, was wildly successful with over $800k in pledges (to date) across all crowdfunding platforms. The Duffle Suitcase has been successfully delivered to satisfied backers in over 73 countries–and counting!</p>
<p>Wool &amp; Oak has gained an extraordinary amount of knowledge from the Duffle Suitcase crowdfunding campaign, all of which is being applied to further streamlining the entire experience for backers of The DuffleBackpack.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Wool &amp; Oak is led by three experienced entrepreneurs that are dedicated to making The DuffleBackpack a reality for our backers.</p>
<p>Johnathan, the Founder/CEO of Wool &amp; Oak and The DuffleBackpack’s designer, is a fashion industry insider with deep connections to a network of global manufacturers and significant experience with industry supply chain and logistics management. Johnathan’s fashion industry expertise covers design, technical design, and production development (to name but a few of his talents) and he’s worked for some of the world’s foremost fashion houses such as Helmut Lang and Theory. The DuffleBackpack is–literally–a designer travel set.</p>
<p>Gizem is Wool &amp; Oak's Director of Marketing. Gizem graduated from The Berlin School of Economics and Law.  With a focus on marketing, unlimited creativity, and a keen eye for details, she provides innovative ideas, creative insight, and the skills to deliver.</p>
<p>Ryan is Wool &amp; Oak’s Director of Operations, and a seasoned entrepreneur with business management expertise across a diverse cross section of industries. He is responsible for ensuring our campaign’s operations run as efficiently as possible. Ryan is an engineer that’s passionate about high quality, functional product design. <br/>***</p>
<p>We have secured our manufacturers, shippers and fulfillment centers, all of whom are waiting for us to give them the green light! All of our partners have over 5 decades of experience. Our manufacturers are professional, precise and ethical.</p>
<p>*** <br/>Our freight forwarders move tons of product daily and are ready for our business. We have partnered up with one of the industry's leading fulfillment center so our backers will get their DuffleBackpacks in pristine condition and on time.</p>
<p>*** <br/>With all of that being said, we must note that unforeseen complications do occasionally arise. Natural disasters or accidents are unavoidable. We’ve constructed our timelines with reasonable accommodations for unforeseen events, and The DuffleBackpack will be insured throughout every step of its arrival to your doorstep.</p>
<p>Wool &amp; Oak has a keen understanding of the fact that delays in the fashion industry are sometimes inevitable, so our anticipated delivery dates are conservative estimates. If all runs smoothly there is a chance you will receive your bag earlier than expected!</p>
<p>Some international backers will be subject to local customs import duties and taxes; these backers will be responsible for for covering all of their local customs duties and taxes. Import duties and taxes are not covered by this campaign or by Wool &amp; Oak.</p>
<p>Wool &amp; Oak “DuffleBackpack” Indiegogo Shipping Policy</p>
<p>U.S. SHIPMENTS:</p>
<p>Most domestic shipments are sent through USPS, UPS, or FedEx. The exact service depends on the size and weight of your order. U.S. Delivery Times: Handling time is generally 1-3 business days, and once shipped packages usually reach their destination in 2-5 business days.</p>
<p>INTERNATIONAL SHIPMENTS:</p>
<p>Wool &amp; Oak leverages a network of international shipping hubs that provide various services, depending on the destination. Prior to shipping an order we cannot guarantee which shipping hub or service or warehouse will be used. We can guarantee that our system is optimized to find the fastest ground service possible.</p>
<p>International Delivery Times: Orders typically take 4-10 business days to reach international destinations; however, some shipments can take up to 3-4 weeks to reach certain destinations due to complexities associated with international shipping and local customs.</p>
<p>Customs &amp; Duties: Our international shipping hubs are purposed to help reduce complexities and duties (where applicable) associated with international shipments. Wool &amp; Oak is not responsible for any customs, duties or import fees associated with receiving your Wool &amp; Oak order.</p>
<p>Wool &amp; Oak “DuffleBackpack” Indiegogo Warranty &amp; Return Policy</p>
<p>While all of our products include a warranty against any manufacturer defects, it is not our policy to offer refunds or returns on items received as Indiegogo rewards. We will consider exchanges on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>Castle Bagging is a small start-up looking to make a big impact on Scottish tourism. We are currently raising funds to develop our application (and website). Both our app and website will be designed as both an information hub as well as a fun, competitive game which will encourage users to visit more than 300 castles around Scotland and ‘bag’ them. Users will be able to check off their progress on an interactive map/list, share their progress through social media, and get interesting information about the castles they visit. Castles will be categorised into type (Public, Private, Ruined, etc) and users will be able to earn points for each castle they visit and can then increase their ranking/titles based on points earned.. Additionally, the ‘page’ of each castle will offer unique historical information/stories. There will also be optional push notifications to alert users when they are passing within 5 miles of an unbagged castle.  </p>
<p>The inspiration behind Castle Bagging came from the popular Scottish sport of Munro Bagging (climbing the 282 mountains in Scotland). We decided to adapt this fun and competitive activity into a more family/visitor friendly adventure. Our hope is to help visitors explore the spectacular and hidden gems often missed by the average visitor.  </p>
<p>Price: Castle Bagging will be a free app and available in apple and android stores  </p>
<p>Product Positioning/Brand Values: Authentic, Undiscovered/off the beaten path, friendly, exploration, welcoming, learn, discover  </p>
<p>Big Idea: Explore in a fun/competitive way  </p>
<p>Funds: 100% of money profited on kickstarter will go into the development process of the App and website  </p>
<p>Long-term Future Opportunities: As Castle Bagging grows, we would like to eventually hold an annual event each year where a scavenger race is set up.

  Intentionally engineered ReveaLED makes the perfect device for frequent travelers and avid photographers when exploring the hidden worlds.  
 ReveaLED is the world's only UV light that is especially designed for travelers and photographers. ReveaLED is a great tool when traveling anywhere in the world. It gives peace of mind when you stay in a hotel after scanning your room from beds to toilet seats with ReveaLED. ReveaLED vs Others ReveaLED team has tested different UV wavelengths with different combinations on more than dozens of materials and fluid samples in order to finalize the best portable UV lamp. Right combination of different wavelength UV chips allow ReveaLED to glow the fluids instantly and powerfully.
 Travelers have become increasingly aware of cleanliness, hygiene and health while travelling is vital to them. Who would want to sleep on the dirty sheets anyways. Sleeping on used sheets means you are sharing it with an other person that you don’t know. And if the dirty sheets are infected, you can get acne, allergies, eczema, asthma, cold and flu right away.   

 

 

 Infectious Diseases Physician Dr. Leong confirmed that some STDs can indeed be transferred to another person who used contaminated bed-linen, pillow cases and towels. An infectious diseases expert claimed in the report that some sexually transmitted diseases may actually be passed on to others via contaminated towels. He also noted that the bacteria left on bed sheets may even lead to gastrointestinal issues such as diarrhea.
 ReveaLED helps you to find body fluids on the bed sheets, pillow cases and towels for closer inspection of hotel room bedding before crawling between the sheets and using the towels.  With ReveaLED the hotel guests can make sure that their sheets don't have any stains and body fluids from previous guests. Using UV light any stains such as urine or semen (Gross!) glow up in the dark and what you have been told are fresh sheets can clearly be seen as not. Because ReveaLED is so specialized in combination of the right UV wavelengths, things that cannot be seen can now be seen. ReveaLED is a “Mini Rechargeable UV and White Light” that switches between ultra bright white light and UV light at the press of a button. The same button when pressed for 5 seconds also acts as the on and off switch. The very lightweight and portable UV light is charged using a conventional USB charger. Compact in size, easily transportable and made using the high quality LED chips, ReveaLED is robust, light weight and fits into any small bag or even a pocket. ReveaLED is an UV and White Light LED light combined in one unit that is rechargeable, portable and bright for any purposes. 
 
 
 Our story with Kickstarter starts about 3 years ago. The first versions of ReveaLED was born with the help of the Kickstarter community in 2016 and since then we have shipped around 5000 units on time to our backers. We have received a lot of support and amazing feedbacks from our backers. We continuously developed ReveaLED to make it even better and after three years of testing and prototyping, we finalized the best portable UV light ever. We also wanted to focus more on travelers and photographers so we moved the newer version of ReveaLED to our new Kickstarter page under ""StudiOwl"" where we will be launching exciting new products that are focusing on travelers & photographers. Quality and reliability were two of the most important factors considered in its development. To this end ReveaLED is an exceptionally high quality electronic product that is easy to use and extremely reliable. We also engineered a PCB board that allowed us to have bright white color option in our current version. 
 Not only is ReveaLED portable but it was developed with practicality in mind. ReveaLED comes with a strong optional clip that allows this powerful light to be clipped to a mobile phone to enable the phone to take a UV photo serving both a practical and fun purpose.#1 STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED! ReveaLED is now available in Black. Backers will be able to pick their choice of colors in the survey once the campaign is over. #1 STRETCH GOAL UNLOCKED#2 STRETCH GOAL: Brightness Button We asked for your opinion about the next stretch goal idea in our first update and received a lot of requests for an adjustable brightness option for photography purposes. We accepted this challenge as our next “ $75K Stretch Goal ” and already started to make a sample with an adjustable brightness button. We also confirmed it with our manufacturers that this new feature will not effect our promised shipping date.  
 We managed to design a compact PCB and install 55 pieces of very high quality, extremely powerful LED chips that emit both white and UV light on a single PCB board. Another distinguishing factor about ReveaLED is that the unit uses multi wavelengths of UV light. The vast majority of entry level UV light sources only use one UV light wavelength.  By using multiple different wavelengths of UV light ReveaLED finds hidden fluids that other UV light tools can easily miss. UV Wavelength Test ResultsBy using multi-wavelength UV chips and 180 degree wide angle, ReveaLED finds hidden fluids that most of the other UV lights can easily miss.   
 
 Another important challenge ReveaLED overcomes is portability. On TV shows such as CSI and Inside Edition, teams are used to seeing large UV lamps or cumbersome UV torches that are quite heavy. Or if you have one those UV flash lights with a single wavelength, you have to scan all the bed inch by inch as the light only points at one spot while ReveaLED has 180degree wide angle that allows you to scan the bed completely at one look. Bringing portability with brightness and reliability together is what sets ReveaLED apart in the market place.

<div><strong>IMPORTANT UPDATE: I Have found a good place for printing here in India, so I will change the perks you will receive  for better ones, but Indiegogo does not let me edit them, so I will see how I write it in a clear way. I am now running to photograph cnstrucion workers and i need time to update the gifts, but for example the picture size is not 30x20 cm but A3 (30x50cm) and I will send one children photobook for orders of 20 euro and more, and where it says 1 photo 30x20 I will add one extra and the size is not 30x20 but A3. Also for orders of 30 or more, I will add a huge size photo in black and white printed on plastic (similar to canvas)Orders of 50 or mor, will have a 64 photo book.  There is only 3 days left, so we need all your support. Also, as I am not sure of reaching the target, I have decided that if we dont collect more than 1000 Euro, then all the money will go to the school, I mean I will spend all moey in digital cameras, film for photos, a printer, ink and so on</strong></div>

<p><strong>India Third Eye</strong><strong>    </strong> a photography project that focuses in using travel and photography towards helping others</p>
<p>My name is Gerardo, I am a photography lover who decided it is time for my photos to go further than my computer screen. I like to use <em>WE</em> instead of I, as <em>WE</em> are never alone - people will always come in our way to offer a helpful hand when we have a genuine goal. <em>WE</em> decided to nickname our Camera as our Third Eye. When an image is captured with the Third Eye, it goes beyond time and space and becomes immortal.</p>
<p>With <em>India Third Eye</em> (ITE) we intend to promote the use of travelling and photography not just for self-satisfaction, but also in order to help others. On our previous visit to India we observed many disadvantages that people go through, especially women and children; therefore ITE is focused on helping them. When we photographed people, we noticed that they became very happy. We felt disappointed that we were unable to print an instant copy for them, or email a copy later.</p>
<p><strong>The ITE Project</strong></p>
<p><em>WE</em> have contacted Kati and Siobhan from the <em>Jeevan School</em> here in Varanasi. They currently work in a school and home with 150 children in the school and 33 living in the home. We would love to help them to buy some materials for the school and If you like the project, we will need you to get involved as well.</p>
<p>In the next few days, we will teach kids how to build an inexpensive pinhole camera using cardboard from a shoebox. When the cameras are made, the kids can have great fun taking portraits of each other. Afterwards, <em>ITE</em> will print a photo for each child to take home and we will also print a number of very large photos that will be publically exhibited on the school walls in order to raise awareness of our action. The children will also receive a photo book each with the photos made by them.</p>
<p>By getting involved you will be helping the kids to have fun and learn how to make a photo camera with almost no money. We hope to awaken in them a passion for photography or at the very least to provide them with a new and exciting experience. <em>ITE</em> invites anyone who cares to become involved in the project. So far, many people we have met have shown great interest and offered help in the project. We hope you can also help us.</p>
<p><strong>How to Get Involved</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>You can participate by choosing one of the unique gifts on the right of the screen. We will send you big thanks, a photo of the kids signed by them, a photo book with photos made by them and a photo book with my photos from India. We will produce them with love and this is has more value than anything else.</li>
</ol><ol start=""2"">
<li>You can also help by getting the word out and making some noise about our project by using Indiego share tools, post on Facebook, Twitter, Nasia Klasia, VKontact and other social networks</li>
</ol><p>The money raised will be used in three ways:</p>
<p>Stage 1:           To buy camera film, paper, glue, scissors, tape, paintbrushes, buckets and anything else we may need for the children to make and use their cameras. The large poster photograph will also be constructed and hung using these funds.</p>
<p>Stage 2:           To donate photographic equipment and materials to the school home. For example one or two digital cameras, a printer, printer toner, printing paper and photography books for the kids to learn and play.</p>
<p>Stage 3:  <strong> (only if we collect more than 1000 Euro)</strong>        To fund a photo documentary exhibition of the ITE Project in Europe with all funds raised through the exhibition used directly to start a new international project.</p>
<p>There is a second part of this <em>action</em> that involves an investigation about women working in the construction sector. <em>ITE </em>will update this part later as we have still to contact an organization that works with them. The idea is to link the pain suffered by women in Indian society where they do not have access to the same education and jobs as men with the strong impact on their children. Many times these women are seen working almost as slaves with their children next to them, instead of the children going to school. Also, on our arrival to India the country was in shock over the death of a student who was brutally raped and killed by 6 men. We will try to report also on this issue, as we think there is a strong connection between the 3 topics.</p>
<p><strong>How We Will Use the Money</strong></p>
<p><em>ITE</em> estimates that 1500 Euro will be needed to complete all three stages of this project.</p>
<p>For example: Stage 1 will cost around 200-300 Euro (there are 150 children!!).  The remaining money will be split 60% for Stage 2 and 40% for Stage 3. <strong>These are estimates only.</strong></p>
<p><em>All our tickets are covered and travel expenses, food, and personal expenses are already included in our personal budget. ALL money coming from your help will be used ONLY for ITE. We will be as transparent as we can, updating in the money that is being used, for you to be able to keep a track of it.</em></p>
<p>By buying a photo or a book you will making a huge help towards ITE project and you will contribute to the most important Goal of the project: to put a smile in someone´s face (or 150 little smiles)</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>By buying just one photograph you will not only be supporting the work of the <em>WE</em>, but you will be directly involved in bringing a smile to a child’s face. You will be providing opportunities to these kids that they might never have had - It might even awaken a child´s interest in photography.</p>
<p>ITE is our first international project.  ITE has a vision to continue raising awareness of international human right issues through the use of photography. Our aim is not only to help the people who are being photographed, but also to empower the traveller to become more aware and mindful so it isn’t just about what a place and the people can give to them, but rather what <em>WE</em> can contribute to the communities visited.</p>
<p>The next ITE project will probably be in Cambodia working with landmine victims and continuing to work with underprivileged women and children. We are also hoping to get more people involved especially known photographers who can contribute by giving free photography workshops to travellers.  </p>
<p align=""center"">Many thanks to all of you for reading. We will be updating on a daily basis.</p>

<p><strong>VERSION EN ESPAÑOL </strong>  (he puesto antes la version en Ingles no porque tenga preferencia por este Idioma, sino poruqe es el mas hablado internacionalmente no solo por Anglosajones, sino Tambien por el resto del Mundo, incluso muchos hispanohablantes)</p>
<p><strong>India Third Eye</strong> (Tercer ojo de India)     un proyecto de fotografía que se centra en el uso de los viajes y la fotografía para ayudar a los demás</p>
<p>Mi nombre es Gerardo, soy un amante de la fotografía, que decidió que es tiempo de que mis fotos lleguen más allá de la pantalla de mi ordenador. Prefiero utilizar <strong>NOSOTROS</strong> en luger de <strong>YO</strong>, ya que nunca estamos solos – siempre aparece en nuestro camino la persona indicada para ofrecer una mano cuando tenemos un objetivo genuino. Decidimos apodar nuestra Cámara como nuestro “tercer ojo”. Cuando una imagen se capta con el tercer ojo, va más allá del tiempo y del espacio y se convierte en inmortal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Con el Tercer ojo de INDIA (ITE en Ingles) tenemos la intención de promover el uso de los viajes y la fotografía no sólo para la satisfacción personal, sino también con el fin de ayudar a los demás. En nuestra anterior visita a la India observamos muchas desventajas que las personas atraviesan, especialmente mujeres y niños, por eso ITE se orienta en ayudarlos. Cuando fotografiamos personas en India, nos dimos cuenta de que estos se ponen muy felices. Nos sentimos decepcionados de que no pudimos imprimir una copia instantánea para ellos, o enviar una copia por correo electrónico.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>El Proyecto ITE</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hemos contactado con Kati y Siobhan de la Escuela Jeevan aquí en Varanasi. En la actualidad trabajan en una escuela- hogar con 150 niños en la escuela 33 niños en el hogar. Nos encantaría ayudarles a comprar algunos materiales para la escuela y si te gusta el proyecto, esperamos que te involucres. Tambien organizaremos una exposicion al aire libre aqui en Varanasi y otra en Europa, para que otros viajeros y locales entren en conciencia del Proyecto.</p>
<p>En los próximos días, vamos a enseñar a los niños cómo construir una cámara estenopeica de cartón de bajo costo utilizando una caja de zapatos. Cuando las cámaras estén hechas, los niños podrán divertirse haciendo retratos entre ellos. Posteriormente, ITE  imprimirá una foto de cada niño para que pueda llevar a su casa y también vamos a imprimir una serie de fotos-poster de gran tamaño que se exhibirá públicamente en las paredes de la escuela con el fin de aumentar la conciencia de nuestra acción. Los niños también recibirán un libro de fotos cada uno con las fotos hechas por ellos con sus compañeros</p>
<p>Al participar estarás ayudando a los niños a divertirse y aprender cómo hacer una cámara de fotos con muy poco dinero. Esperamos despertar en ellos la pasión por la fotografía o por lo menos proporcionarles una experiencia nueva y emocionante. ITE invita a todo aquel que quiera participar en el proyecto. Hasta ahora, muchas personas que hemos conocido han mostrado gran interés y ofredido ayuda en este proyecto. Esperamos que vos también nos puedas  ayudar.</p>
<p>Cómo participar?</p>
<p>Puedes participar eligiendo uno de los regalos únicos de la derecha de la pantalla, a cambio de una donación. Nosotros te enviaremos las gracias, una foto de los niños firmados por ellos, un libro de fotos hechas por ellos y un libro con mis fotos de la India. Vamos a producir todos estos regalos con amor y esto se tiene más valor que cualquier otra cosa.</p>
<p>También puedes ayudar haciendo correr la voz y hacer algo de ruido sobre nuestro proyecto utilizando las herramientas para compartir de Indiego, publicar en Facebook, Twitter, Klasia Nasia, VKontact y otras redes sociales</p>
<p><strong>El dinero recaudado será utilizado de tres maneras</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Etapa 1: Para comprar película fotográfica, papel, pegamento, tijeras, cinta adhesiva, brochas, cubos y cualquier otra cosa necesitarias para que los niños construyan sus cámaras. Tambien se utilizara el dinero para producir las foto-poster de gran tamaño.</li>
<li>Etapa 2: Para donar material fotográfico y los materiales para la casa de la escuela. Por ejemplo, una o dos cámaras digitales, una impresora, tóner de impresora, papel de impresión y de libros de fotografía para que los niños aprendan y jueguen. Mientras mas dinero se recaude, más material podra ser donado a la escuela.</li>
<li>Etapa 3: Para financiar una exposición documental foto del proyecto ITE en Europa. En el caso de que esta exposición genere mas recaudaciones serán utilizadas directamente para iniciar un nuevo proyecto internacional.</li>
</ul><p>Hay una segunda parte de esta acción que implica una investigación acerca de las mujeres que trabajan en el sector de la construcción. ITE actualizará esta última parte ya que tenemos todavía que contactar con la organización que trabaja con ellos. La idea es relacionar el dolor que sufren las mujeres en la sociedad india en la que no tienen acceso a la misma educación y el empleo que los hombres con el fuerte impacto que produce en sus hijos. Muchas veces estas mujeres pueden ser vistas trabajando casi como esclavas con sus hijos junto a ellas, en lugar de los niños ir a la escuela. Además, al tiempo de nuestra llegada a la India el país estaba en estado de shock por la muerte de una estudiante que fue brutalmente violada y asesinada por seis hombres. Vamos a tratar de informar también sobre este tema, ya que creo que hay una fuerte conexión entre los tres temas.</p>
<p><strong>¿Cómo vamos a utilizar el dinero?</strong></p>
<p>ITE estima que se necesitaran por lo menos 1500 Euro para completar las tres etapas de este proyecto.</p>
<p>Por ejemplo: La Etapa 1 tendrá un costo de alrededor de 200-300 euros (hay 150 niños!).A esto hay que sumarle el dinero necesario para producir los regalos para la gente que nos apoya y los gastos de envio. El resto del dinero se repartirá el 60% para la Etapa 2 y el 40% para la Etapa 3. <strong>Estos son sólo estimaciones</strong>.</p>
<p>Todas nuestros tickets, pasajes de avion <strong>están cubiertos</strong> y los gastos de viaje, comida y gastos personales ya están incluidos en nuestro presupuesto personal. <strong>TODO</strong> el dinero que viene de tu ayuda se utilizará <strong>únicamente</strong> para ITE. Vamos a ser tan transparente como sea posible, actualizando en el dinero que se está utilizando, para que tu seas capaz de mantener un seguimiento del mismo.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Al comprar una foto o un libro estarás dando una gran ayuda al proyecto ITE y contribuirás a cumplir la meta más importante del proyecto: poner una sonrisa en la cara de alguien (o 150 pequeñas sonrisas)</p>
<p><strong>El impacto</strong></p>
<p>Al comprar una sola fotografía no sólo vas a apoyar nuestro trabajo, sino que también estarás directamente involucrado en darle una sonrisa a un niño. Le otorgarás a estos niños una oportunidad que tal vez nunca han tenido - Incluso podría despertar el interés de los niños en la fotografía.</p>
<p>ITE es nuestro primer proyecto internacional. ITE tiene la visión de seguir generando conciencia en las cuestiones internacionales de derechos humanos mediante el uso de la fotografía. Nuestro objetivo no es sólo ayudar a las personas que están siendo fotografiadas, sino también darle a otros viajeros el poder de ser más conscientes y atentos ya MINDFUL Travelling no se trata sólo de lo un lugar y la gente puede dar al viajero, sino más bien lo que el viajero puede contribuir hacia las comunidades visitadas.</p>
<p>El próximo proyecto ITE será probablemente en Camboya trabajando con víctimas de minas terrestres y por supouesto seguir trabajando con las mujeres y los niños desfavorecidos. También deseamos poder involucrar a más personas, especialmente fotógrafos conocidos que pueden contribuir dando talleres gratuitos de fotografía para viajeros.</p>
<p>Muchas gracias a todos ustedes por leer. Estaremos actualizando a diario.</p>

Also, as I am not sure of reaching the target, I have decided that if we dont collect more than 1000 Euro, then all the money will go to the school, I mean I will spend all moey in digital cameras, film for photos, a printer, ink and so on

India Third Eye     a photography project that focuses in using travel and photography towards helping others
My name is Gerardo, I am a photography lover who decided it is time for my photos to go further than my computer screen. I like to use WE instead of I, as WE are never alone - people will always come in our way to offer a helpful hand when we have a genuine goal. WE decided to nickname our Camera as our Third Eye. When an image is captured with the Third Eye, it goes beyond time and space and becomes immortal.
With India Third Eye (ITE) we intend to promote the use of travelling and photography not just for self-satisfaction, but also in order to help others. On our previous visit to India we observed many disadvantages that people go through, especially women and children; therefore ITE is focused on helping them. When we photographed people, we noticed that they became very happy. We felt disappointed that we were unable to print an instant copy for them, or email a copy later.
The ITE Project
WE have contacted Kati and Siobhan from the Jeevan School here in Varanasi. They currently work in a school and home with 150 children in the school and 33 living in the home. We would love to help them to buy some materials for the school and If you like the project, we will need you to get involved as well.
In the next few days, we will teach kids how to build an inexpensive pinhole camera using cardboard from a shoebox. When the cameras are made, the kids can have great fun taking portraits of each other. Afterwards, ITE will print a photo for each child to take home and we will also print a number of very large photos that will be publically exhibited on the school walls in order to raise awareness of our action. The children will also receive a photo book each with the photos made by them.
By getting involved you will be helping the kids to have fun and learn how to make a photo camera with almost no money. We hope to awaken in them a passion for photography or at the very least to provide them with a new and exciting experience. ITE invites anyone who cares to become involved in the project. So far, many people we have met have shown great interest and offered help in the project. We hope you can also help us.
How to Get Involved

You can participate by choosing one of the unique gifts on the right of the screen. We will send you big thanks, a photo of the kids signed by them, a photo book with photos made by them and a photo book with my photos from India. We will produce them with love and this is has more value than anything else.

You can also help by getting the word out and making some noise about our project by using Indiego share tools, post on Facebook, Twitter, Nasia Klasia, VKontact and other social networks
The money raised will be used in three ways:
Stage 1:           To buy camera film, paper, glue, scissors, tape, paintbrushes, buckets and anything else we may need for the children to make and use their cameras. The large poster photograph will also be constructed and hung using these funds.
Stage 2:           To donate photographic equipment and materials to the school home. For example one or two digital cameras, a printer, printer toner, printing paper and photography books for the kids to learn and play.
Stage 3:   (only if we collect more than 1000 Euro)        To fund a photo documentary exhibition of the ITE Project in Europe with all funds raised through the exhibition used directly to start a new international project.
There is a second part of this action that involves an investigation about women working in the construction sector. ITE will update this part later as we have still to contact an organization that works with them. The idea is to link the pain suffered by women in Indian society where they do not have access to the same education and jobs as men with the strong impact on their children. Many times these women are seen working almost as slaves with their children next to them, instead of the children going to school. Also, on our arrival to India the country was in shock over the death of a student who was brutally raped and killed by 6 men. We will try to report also on this issue, as we think there is a strong connection between the 3 topics.
How We Will Use the Money
ITE estimates that 1500 Euro will be needed to complete all three stages of this project.
For example: Stage 1 will cost around 200-300 Euro (there are 150 children!!).  The remaining money will be split 60% for Stage 2 and 40% for Stage 3. These are estimates only.
All our tickets are covered and travel expenses, food, and personal expenses are already included in our personal budget. ALL money coming from your help will be used ONLY for ITE. We will be as transparent as we can, updating in the money that is being used, for you to be able to keep a track of it.
By buying a photo or a book you will making a huge help towards ITE project and you will contribute to the most important Goal of the project: to put a smile in someone´s face (or 150 little smiles)
The Impact
By buying just one photograph you will not only be supporting the work of the WE, but you will be directly involved in bringing a smile to a child’s face. You will be providing opportunities to these kids that they might never have had - It might even awaken a child´s interest in photography.
ITE is our first international project.  ITE has a vision to continue raising awareness of international human right issues through the use of photography. Our aim is not only to help the people who are being photographed, but also to empower the traveller to become more aware and mindful so it isn’t just about what a place and the people can give to them, but rather what WE can contribute to the communities visited.
The next ITE project will probably be in Cambodia working with landmine victims and continuing to work with underprivileged women and children. We are also hoping to get more people involved especially known photographers who can contribute by giving free photography workshops to travellers.  
Many thanks to all of you for reading. We will be updating on a daily basis.

VERSION EN ESPAÑOL   (he puesto antes la version en Ingles no porque tenga preferencia por este Idioma, sino poruqe es el mas hablado internacionalmente no solo por Anglosajones, sino Tambien por el resto del Mundo, incluso muchos hispanohablantes)
India Third Eye (Tercer ojo de India)     un proyecto de fotografía que se centra en el uso de los viajes y la fotografía para ayudar a los demás
Mi nombre es Gerardo, soy un amante de la fotografía, que decidió que es tiempo de que mis fotos lleguen más allá de la pantalla de mi ordenador. Prefiero utilizar NOSOTROS en luger de YO, ya que nunca estamos solos – siempre aparece en nuestro camino la persona indicada para ofrecer una mano cuando tenemos un objetivo genuino. Decidimos apodar nuestra Cámara como nuestro “tercer ojo”. Cuando una imagen se capta con el tercer ojo, va más allá del tiempo y del espacio y se convierte en inmortal.
 
Con el Tercer ojo de INDIA (ITE en Ingles) tenemos la intención de promover el uso de los viajes y la fotografía no sólo para la satisfacción personal, sino también con el fin de ayudar a los demás. En nuestra anterior visita a la India observamos muchas desventajas que las personas atraviesan, especialmente mujeres y niños, por eso ITE se orienta en ayudarlos. Cuando fotografiamos personas en India, nos dimos cuenta de que estos se ponen muy felices. Nos sentimos decepcionados de que no pudimos imprimir una copia instantánea para ellos, o enviar una copia por correo electrónico.
 
El Proyecto ITE
 
Hemos contactado con Kati y Siobhan de la Escuela Jeevan aquí en Varanasi. En la actualidad trabajan en una escuela- hogar con 150 niños en la escuela 33 niños en el hogar. Nos encantaría ayudarles a comprar algunos materiales para la escuela y si te gusta el proyecto, esperamos que te involucres. Tambien organizaremos una exposicion al aire libre aqui en Varanasi y otra en Europa, para que otros viajeros y locales entren en conciencia del Proyecto.
En los próximos días, vamos a enseñar a los niños cómo construir una cámara estenopeica de cartón de bajo costo utilizando una caja de zapatos. Cuando las cámaras estén hechas, los niños podrán divertirse haciendo retratos entre ellos. Posteriormente, ITE  imprimirá una foto de cada niño para que pueda llevar a su casa y también vamos a imprimir una serie de fotos-poster de gran tamaño que se exhibirá públicamente en las paredes de la escuela con el fin de aumentar la conciencia de nuestra acción. Los niños también recibirán un libro de fotos cada uno con las fotos hechas por ellos con sus compañeros
Al participar estarás ayudando a los niños a divertirse y aprender cómo hacer una cámara de fotos con muy poco dinero. Esperamos despertar en ellos la pasión por la fotografía o por lo menos proporcionarles una experiencia nueva y emocionante. ITE invita a todo aquel que quiera participar en el proyecto. Hasta ahora, muchas personas que hemos conocido han mostrado gran interés y ofredido ayuda en este proyecto. Esperamos que vos también nos puedas  ayudar.
Cómo participar?
Puedes participar eligiendo uno de los regalos únicos de la derecha de la pantalla, a cambio de una donación. Nosotros te enviaremos las gracias, una foto de los niños firmados por ellos, un libro de fotos hechas por ellos y un libro con mis fotos de la India. Vamos a producir todos estos regalos con amor y esto se tiene más valor que cualquier otra cosa.
También puedes ayudar haciendo correr la voz y hacer algo de ruido sobre nuestro proyecto utilizando las herramientas para compartir de Indiego, publicar en Facebook, Twitter, Klasia Nasia, VKontact y otras redes sociales
El dinero recaudado será utilizado de tres maneras:

Etapa 1: Para comprar película fotográfica, papel, pegamento, tijeras, cinta adhesiva, brochas, cubos y cualquier otra cosa necesitarias para que los niños construyan sus cámaras. Tambien se utilizara el dinero para producir las foto-poster de gran tamaño.
Etapa 2: Para donar material fotográfico y los materiales para la casa de la escuela. Por ejemplo, una o dos cámaras digitales, una impresora, tóner de impresora, papel de impresión y de libros de fotografía para que los niños aprendan y jueguen. Mientras mas dinero se recaude, más material podra ser donado a la escuela.
Etapa 3: Para financiar una exposición documental foto del proyecto ITE en Europa. En el caso de que esta exposición genere mas recaudaciones serán utilizadas directamente para iniciar un nuevo proyecto internacional.
Hay una segunda parte de esta acción que implica una investigación acerca de las mujeres que trabajan en el sector de la construcción. ITE actualizará esta última parte ya que tenemos todavía que contactar con la organización que trabaja con ellos. La idea es relacionar el dolor que sufren las mujeres en la sociedad india en la que no tienen acceso a la misma educación y el empleo que los hombres con el fuerte impacto que produce en sus hijos. Muchas veces estas mujeres pueden ser vistas trabajando casi como esclavas con sus hijos junto a ellas, en lugar de los niños ir a la escuela. Además, al tiempo de nuestra llegada a la India el país estaba en estado de shock por la muerte de una estudiante que fue brutalmente violada y asesinada por seis hombres. Vamos a tratar de informar también sobre este tema, ya que creo que hay una fuerte conexión entre los tres temas.
¿Cómo vamos a utilizar el dinero?
ITE estima que se necesitaran por lo menos 1500 Euro para completar las tres etapas de este proyecto.
Por ejemplo: La Etapa 1 tendrá un costo de alrededor de 200-300 euros (hay 150 niños!).A esto hay que sumarle el dinero necesario para producir los regalos para la gente que nos apoya y los gastos de envio. El resto del dinero se repartirá el 60% para la Etapa 2 y el 40% para la Etapa 3. Estos son sólo estimaciones.
Todas nuestros tickets, pasajes de avion están cubiertos y los gastos de viaje, comida y gastos personales ya están incluidos en nuestro presupuesto personal. TODO el dinero que viene de tu ayuda se utilizará únicamente para ITE. Vamos a ser tan transparente como sea posible, actualizando en el dinero que se está utilizando, para que tu seas capaz de mantener un seguimiento del mismo.
 
Al comprar una foto o un libro estarás dando una gran ayuda al proyecto ITE y contribuirás a cumplir la meta más importante del proyecto: poner una sonrisa en la cara de alguien (o 150 pequeñas sonrisas)
El impacto
Al comprar una sola fotografía no sólo vas a apoyar nuestro trabajo, sino que también estarás directamente involucrado en darle una sonrisa a un niño. Le otorgarás a estos niños una oportunidad que tal vez nunca han tenido - Incluso podría despertar el interés de los niños en la fotografía.
ITE es nuestro primer proyecto internacional. ITE tiene la visión de seguir generando conciencia en las cuestiones internacionales de derechos humanos mediante el uso de la fotografía. Nuestro objetivo no es sólo ayudar a las personas que están siendo fotografiadas, sino también darle a otros viajeros el poder de ser más conscientes y atentos ya MINDFUL Travelling no se trata sólo de lo un lugar y la gente puede dar al viajero, sino más bien lo que el viajero puede contribuir hacia las comunidades visitadas.
El próximo proyecto ITE será probablemente en Camboya trabajando con víctimas de minas terrestres y por supouesto seguir trabajando con las mujeres y los niños desfavorecidos. También deseamos poder involucrar a más personas, especialmente fotógrafos conocidos que pueden contribuir dando talleres gratuitos de fotografía para viajeros.
Muchas gracias a todos ustedes por leer. Estaremos actualizando a diario.

<p>Lifekiy ensures you about the payment procedure’s safety. That’s why we have built a complex system explained below:</p>
<p>The system could be characterized as a contractual arrangement in which a trusted 3rd party receives and disburses money or documents for the primary transacting parties, with the disbursement dependent on conditions agreed to by the transacting parties.</p>
<p>In particular, let’s assume we are organizing the experience described in the example above.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>STEP 1:</b><br/></p>When the best offers, for a 6-member group, are on table from our providers, the organizer has what he needs to set the budget. The providers accord the organizer’s attendance as a part of the deal. The organizer has to sum the prices, calculate a 3% commission for Lifekiy’s services and divide the budget, so that his 5 co-travelers pay the same amount of money.<br/><p></p>

<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>STEP 2:</b><br/></p>
<p>The providers give the chance to the organizer to join the travel ex-perience for free and the final travel buddies to pay a specific amount of money. The trusted 3rd party, holds each one’s funds till the organizer has decided his 5 co-travelers and the experience is ready to take place.<br/></p>

<p>We are planning to continue Lifekiy’s web platform development, test it and finally release the product. However, there is a risk that further updates will be required after the formal testing and before the final release. In order to minimize this risk, we will work with the developers to ensure weekly feedback and make certain that updates are incorporated to the platform.</p>
<p>We have a marketing and promotion plan involving partnerships and working with traveling networks. In order to ensure efficient and effective promotion we will lev-erage off our networks and encourage your support in spreading the word.</p>

<p>A: Funds are collected after the campaign is over. As you might have noticed our campaign is flexible, that means that Indiegogo won’t refund backers if the target isn’t reached.

      Unique travel experiences organized by creative users!      Get matched with the ideal buddies based on your interests!      Meet your travel buddies and make real friendships!      Book as a group, easily and safely, in a click!      Organize your life-trip and travel for FREE!
"" It is a fact that people do not live the life they were wishing for. A fast moving society and excessive liabilities lead to unfulfilled dreams and hopes to travel and experience more. ""




Lifekiy is a breakthrough to all restrictions. The solution to all things keep-ing you away from your dreams. With Lifekiy there are no excuses such as “no money, no like-minded friends” to live your dreams. The only barrier standing between you and the life you want to live is yourself. Lifekiy gives you the key to a whole new world.
Lifekiy’s community includes two different roles for its users. The Leader’s role and the Life-Buddy’s role. A leader organizes a travel experience, life-buddies join and finally the leader and his life-buddies live the travel experience together. A user can be a leader, a life-buddy or both in different travel experiences. Both leader and life-buddy relay on each other and build an actual relationship.

Why to be a Leader?

Dream fulfilment. Creating and living unique travel experiences

Find ideal life-buddies to share unique travel experiences.

Fund the organized experience & travel for free.

Why to be a Life-buddy?

Extremely unique (niche) travel experiences based on specific interests, com-bined in a single journey.

Travel group of like-minded co-travelers, instead of a group of strangers with-out common interests.

Ability to meet up and choose the ideal co-travelers before the actual travel experience.

What’s the process?

Leaders organize travel experiences for small groups and achieve group dis-counts from providers (airfare, accommodation, transportation etc.)

Life-buddies get to choose between thousands of travel experiences and travel groups.

Life-buddies pay through Lifekiy’s patented payment process, easily & safely.

Leader’s fund their travel experience, benefiting from the group booking dis-counts.





Our goal is to create a community in which everyone could join and fulfil their dream travel experiences, all very easy and safe. Even if you are someone who feels too different, is used to getting called eccentric or even a weirdo, Lifekiy is here to prove that there are ideal groups with like-minded people for you, to share the most awesome travel experiences. All you have to do is follow the steps bellow:

STEP 1   SIGN UP                                                                                                          Create an account and tell us your story. You will be asked to fill in data, such as your interests.

STEP 2   EVENTS & GROUPS                                                                                 Explore and discover thousands of events, organized by us-ers like you. Get matched with events and people that fit you the most. Lifekiy will suggest you the ideal events and groups based on your story.

STEP 3   MEET THEM                                                                                                Get to know the people, matched as ideal for you, interact with them. Choose to attend the perfect event and share it with your favorites.

STEP 4   IN A CLICK                                                                                                  Book as a group and share the experience, easily and safely, in a click!

"" And it gets even more awesome… Feeling inspired?  Be
’s leader, create the most amazing experience & travel for free!  ""





    1. Sign up:
Create an account & tell us about you. The procedure would be the same even if you would not want to organize an experience, but just willing to join a life-trip.

    2. Capture the Idea:
You already know how an ideal experience sounds. Tell Lifekiy’s world. Explain the experience in details.
"" For example, let’s say you would love to spend 15 days in Germa-ny, during October, when many beer festivals are taking place and attend as many as possible. In addition, you would like to move around Germany these days with a motorcycle. It would be great to find 5 guys, and create a group of 6 travelers, sharing the same interests and live the experience together. ""

    3. Quest Offers:
You are ready to seek for the best deals and get offers from pro-viders, like hotel owners, renters, festival ticket sellers etc. Strike a great bargain, get lower prizes and better deals because of the significant amount of the package.
"" For example, in a package of 6, you will get a 10% discount and the one participant enjoys free services. ""
    4. Set Budget & Criteria for Buddies:You have collected the offers and you have chosen the best ones. So you already know how much the experience will cost for a group of 6 travel buddies. It’s time to decide who would make an ideal travel-buddy, set your criteria and let Lifekiy suggest your perfect matches.
    5. Meet Buddies:Meet the potential co-travelers and interact with them through Lifekiy’s platform. Find out if they are the perfect buddies to share this experience. If so, you are ready to book the experience as a group.
    6. Payment procedure:
Lifekiy ensures you about the payment procedure’s safety. That’s why we have built a complex system explained below:
The system could be characterized as a contractual arrangement in which a trusted 3rd party receives and disburses money or documents for the primary transacting parties, with the disbursement dependent on conditions agreed to by the transacting parties.
In particular, let’s assume we are organizing the experience described in the example above.

STEP 1:When the best offers, for a 6-member group, are on table from our providers, the organizer has what he needs to set the budget. The providers accord the organizer’s attendance as a part of the deal. The organizer has to sum the prices, calculate a 3% commission for Lifekiy’s services and divide the budget, so that his 5 co-travelers pay the same amount of money.


STEP 2:
The providers give the chance to the organizer to join the travel ex-perience for free and the final travel buddies to pay a specific amount of money. The trusted 3rd party, holds each one’s funds till the organizer has decided his 5 co-travelers and the experience is ready to take place.



STEP 3:
When all co-travelers are found and the budget has been gathered, the 3rd party releases the funds and pays the providers.



    7. Get Rewarded:
The organizer is ready to enjoy the reward for his creativity, travel for free and live his dream experience with the most amazing people.                                                                                     UK Patent Application No. 1604186






Our team is a collection of diverse individuals with the common aim of inspiring people to live their dreams. This is what drives us on a daily bases and helps us cre-ate a world where living your desires and finding friends has no barriers.























A business model that facilitates the transaction of products or services between nonprofessionals has been disrupting industries since the 1990s. An evolution offering widespread access to tools, such as technology, knowledge and the chance to small businesses and even nonprofessionals to approach and engage consumers.
Retail, Accommodation, Transportation Industries
Giant marketplaces such as the retail industry, the accommodation industry and even the transportation industry have been affected due to this evolution.


Travel industry
It seems like a great opportunity for Lifekiy to present the successful business model to the travel industry. A giant market, with great potential to penetrate into powerful niche markets.




Global travel is now set to grow at a significant fast rate. Shaping the future of the travel industry, macro trends driving industry growth over the next decade predict an optimistic outlook for global travel over the next years, with the industry pro-jected to outstrip global GDP by some 2%, growing 5.4% per annum.



We are planning to continue Lifekiy’s web platform development, test it and finally release the product. However, there is a risk that further updates will be required after the formal testing and before the final release. In order to minimize this risk, we will work with the developers to ensure weekly feedback and make certain that updates are incorporated to the platform.
We have a marketing and promotion plan involving partnerships and working with traveling networks. In order to ensure efficient and effective promotion we will lev-erage off our networks and encourage your support in spreading the word.













Q: What does an Unlimited Free Traveling package contain? Does the package contain airfare, or will I need to purchase tickets separately?

A: The package contains whatever could be included in the budget given. It is on us to create your dream experience, collaborate with you, advice you if something would exceed that budget and try our best to adapt. Yes, airfare is contained into the package, unless the rest of the experience is estimated to exceed your given budget. In this case we could collaborate closely and find the best solution.

Q: Is there ever a deadline in which I must have started using the package?

A: All packages must have started their fulfillment before May 31st, 2017, a year after Lifekiy’s official launch, so if you wish you have the time to wait for a year before planning your first dream experience.

After successfully developing a multi bicycle bike stand for city municipalities, Dutch cyclist Maurice Paulssen is back.This time with an innovative bike stand for personal use. The idea for BikeClip came to me after a bike trip with friends. We concluded that we needed a stand to easily park our bikes in while cleaning the bike, pumping tires, doing small repairs and lube chains. A stand as strong and safe as the ones I created in the past for city municipalities, but then for personal use and affordable. A great idea was born. We only need the funding to start production. Our goal on Kickstarter was: € 20,000 for the first flight. Fellow cyclists, make a stand and pre order now via Indiegogo!”Meet BikeClipBikeClip Bottom BracketIn the first week, we received many questions if it is possible to lift the rear wheel off the ground. Maurice went straight back to his drawing table and designed the BikeClip Bottom Bracket in addition to use with the BikeClip so you can lift the rear wheel off the ground. This way you can change your derailleur settings, clean and lube your chain or do small repairs. The Bottom Bracket will be designed like the BikeClip; solid, easy and no nonsense. The product will be available in two lengths for different bikes.

 
One great stand for 7 good reasons.1. Holds any bike on its front or rear fork.  2. Protects your bike’s derailleurs or disc brakes.  3. Keeps your bike neatly in an upright position.  4. Prevents your bike from falling into other vehicles.  5. Can be used for all wheel sizes.  6. Avoids a tangled mess of bikes in your garage.  7. Build durable in sturdy and solid quality. BikeClip specs BikeClip dimensionsEasy to assembleIn 4 quick steps. So plug, play & ride your bike with pride and take good care of it.

<h3>DE-CAP-ATURTLE</h3>
<p>My Name is Chris Watkins and I am a active duty US military enlisted man and owner of <a href=""WWW.GUNN-FIGHTER.COM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">WWW.GUNN-FIGHTER.COM</a>. I teach tactical self defense classes mostly using firearms but in reality you cant always have a firearm with you. When I leave home one thing I always have with me is my keys. On my keyring was a bottle opener but that was the only purpose it served. I have developed a bottle opener that can be used for self defense purposes while fitting in with the other trinkets hanging from your key ring.</p>
<p>The best thing about the DE-CAP-ATURTLE is that it doesnt look like a weapon and serves a practical purpose. My wife works late at night frequently and her job wont allow her to carry a firearm. Ive always worried about her on the way to her car after she gets off work at night. Any weapon inside her purse would take too long to get to. With the DE-CAP-ATURTLE all she has to do is carry her keys in her hand a certain way and she has a game changer in hand. It makes me feel alot better that I have provided her with protection and I want this feeling of security for all my contributors.</p>
<p><strong>SPECS</strong></p>
<p>The DE-CAP-ATURTLE will open twist caps, bend off caps, soda can flip tabs and Fore-Heads, It is made from aluminum and weighs next to nothing. It will come with a 550 cord tail and intial offerings will be in black and pink. The edge is actually a BESH wedge style tip made to be exceptionally strong and doesnt have a cutting edge. They can be purchased with a pointed or blunt tip. For my miltary brothers the Tip can be used to adjust windage and elevation on red dot optics such as EoTechs. The final design will be be waterjet cut at precise dimensions. The prototypes shown are made by myself for family members, I have 10 prototypes that will also be offered. </p>
<p><strong>WHERE THE FUNDING WILL GO </strong></p>
<p>Funding recieved from contributors will be used to have the initial batch of waterjetted DE-CAP-ATURTLES and to make a run of titanium DE-CAP-ATURTLES. It will also be used for having the finishes applied to the product. If I dont recieve all the funding I will still press forward with the project and contributors will get what they pay for. This is a awesome product if you are serious about you or your loved ones personal safety.</p>
<p>By contributing to this project you will directly influence the outcome of a potential attack on a loved one. I hate to be harsh but this is a harsh world we live in. Please take advantage of this oppurtunity to place security in the hands of your loved ones. And if the attack never comes, DE-CAP, your favorite beverage with this awesome little turtle.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>September of 2007 I broke my neck. Diagnosed with a C7 vertebrae fracture I took some time off my feet, but ultimately recovered with only a minor scar retaining a titanium cage. I continued on with life and found a new passion for adventure travel. There are many individuals that do not get to have the same opportunity to restart life values such as I have.<br/><br/>I met one of these individuals in 2010 prior to the paralympics and he shed light into a new perspective for me. Matt is a mirror of myself; he is 
adventurous, confident and infected with what people call “the travel 
bug”. We are the same age, share the same humor and bear the same 
titanium cages and scars. The only real physical difference between us 
is his wheelchair.<br/><br/>We began to travel together and documented every stroke of the wheel, essentially creating a motivational tool for others (able-bodied, or not) to learn from. In one year we successfully explored two continents, written
reviews on over 38 tours, received international press coverage,
skydived with Australia's first paraplegic skydiver, surfed with a
two-time world champion and, most importantly, lived by the
limitless example we sought to create and share. One year. One
amazing journey.</p>

<p>Upon our arrival back from Australia, we have been recognized by the Rick Hansen Foundation as ""difference makers"" and featured as a highlighted medal-bearer for the upcoming 25th anniversary relay across Canada in which we will be participating. Our story can be seen here: <a href=""http://www.rickhansenrelay.com/en/about-the-relay/featured-medal-bearers/karim.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.rickhansenrelay.com/en/about-the-rel...</a></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Now that we have shown proof of overcoming barriers and obstacles, gained public awareness and raised many eyebrows, we would like to become the first tour operator in the world to offer this experience to other adventure seekers alike. Fully accessible. Transportation, accommodation, food, nightlife and daytime adrenalin sport all included! A weekend getaway which will truly bring life to any individual soul. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We plan to launch out first test-run tour in August where we will conduct a survey to build on our potential. This project will highlight British Columbia as the most accessible place in the world and potentially bring this type of awareness on a global scale. All we seek is funding for our transportation to get these wheels rolling!<span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></p>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Impact</span></h3>
</div><div>We thrive to become the motivational tool of our generation. Through group travel with no segregation of mobility needs, we will help each other in attaining personal self-worth and bring back the confidence buried within. This project will ultimately erase the barriers previously set by an old mentality, and allow others to question their limitation. To prove that every individual has different ability but together we represent an able movement. <br/><br/>We thrive to represent Whistler, Canada as the most adventurous, accessible place in the world and potentially create a wave of awareness/ change to other countries abroad. This will not only assist in mentality of someone with limited mobility, but also able-bodies who seek to push their personal boundaries, together!<br/><br/>To create excitement and confidence to those who lack these particular values in life.<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>9Lives Adventures is on the path to success with awareness, we have created a care-free tour itinerary for the west-coast of BC, and have a launch date this coming August! All we seek from you, the audience, is assistance with funding for a <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">wheelchair accessible shuttle bus</span>. This is the last speed-bump in our path.<br/><br/>Once we get a shuttle bus under the 9lives name, we will be running a shuttle service departing from Vancouver to Whistler. We will create a unique vibrant look to the bus, adding character and attitude to our vision.<br/><br/>If we reach our goal with attaining the transportation we seek, we will give back to our community with a direct wheelchair accessible path to surrounding areas of British Columbia. Furthermore, opening the opportunity for people to get out and experience the life beyond their doorstep. Together.<br/>

<p>Spread our good word and direct people to <a href=""http://www.9livesadventures.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.9livesadventures.com</a> (new website to be launched end of June)<br/><br/>Encourage a change in mentality, and embrace the beautiful differences we all relate to :)<br/></p>

skydived with Australia's first paraplegic skydiver, surfed with a
two-time world champion and, most importantly, lived by the
limitless example we sought to create and share. One year. One
amazing journey.

Upon our arrival back from Australia, we have been recognized by the Rick Hansen Foundation as ""difference makers"" and featured as a highlighted medal-bearer for the upcoming 25th anniversary relay across Canada in which we will be participating. Our story can be seen here: http://www.rickhansenrelay.com/en/about-the-rel...

Now that we have shown proof of overcoming barriers and obstacles, gained public awareness and raised many eyebrows, we would like to become the first tour operator in the world to offer this experience to other adventure seekers alike. Fully accessible. Transportation, accommodation, food, nightlife and daytime adrenalin sport all included! A weekend getaway which will truly bring life to any individual soul. 

We plan to launch out first test-run tour in August where we will conduct a survey to build on our potential. This project will highlight British Columbia as the most accessible place in the world and potentially bring this type of awareness on a global scale. All we seek is funding for our transportation to get these wheels rolling!

The Impact
We thrive to become the motivational tool of our generation. Through group travel with no segregation of mobility needs, we will help each other in attaining personal self-worth and bring back the confidence buried within. This project will ultimately erase the barriers previously set by an old mentality, and allow others to question their limitation. To prove that every individual has different ability but together we represent an able movement. We thrive to represent Whistler, Canada as the most adventurous, accessible place in the world and potentially create a wave of awareness/ change to other countries abroad. This will not only assist in mentality of someone with limited mobility, but also able-bodies who seek to push their personal boundaries, together!To create excitement and confidence to those who lack these particular values in life.

What We Need & What You Get9Lives Adventures is on the path to success with awareness, we have created a care-free tour itinerary for the west-coast of BC, and have a launch date this coming August! All we seek from you, the audience, is assistance with funding for a wheelchair accessible shuttle bus. This is the last speed-bump in our path.Once we get a shuttle bus under the 9lives name, we will be running a shuttle service departing from Vancouver to Whistler. We will create a unique vibrant look to the bus, adding character and attitude to our vision.If we reach our goal with attaining the transportation we seek, we will give back to our community with a direct wheelchair accessible path to surrounding areas of British Columbia. Furthermore, opening the opportunity for people to get out and experience the life beyond their doorstep. Together.

</div>","After creating two of the most backed flashlight projects EVER on Kickstarter, with over 20,000 backers, we set out to create more awesome, minimal EDC products. 



Our Previous Projects


 





We wanted to step-out of our comfort zone and test our abilities to create the best, most premium products. From that, WOLVERINE was born. 
The brand that set the EDC standard has just raised the bar. 





 





 





We focused on a premium, lightweight, and minimal design, providing water-resistant seams and an ultra-durable FuseFabric™ shell. For optimum carry capabilities, we added a removable cross shoulder strap to simply throw over your shoulder. 
Simple, easy and effortless, we see things from a different perspective.



Colors Available: Burnt Orange & Slate Gray


 





Our FuseFabric™ technology vastly improves upon traditional Nylon Ripstop. It’s a revolutionary weaving process that blends thicker, more-durable threads with lighter, lower-density fibers all coming together with a polyurethane coating. This effectively reduces overall weight and creating a seamless experience over all.  





REGENERATIVE - Self healing & repairing when small cuts or punctures occur. No tools needed - simply rub the fabric with your bare hands. 





 





 





COLLAPSIBLE / EXPANDABLE - The roll top bag design allows for flexible storage capability. No longer will you have a floppy nor overstuffed bag.





PACKABLE - The Wolverine packs down to the size of a cell phone at half the weight. Perfect add-on for more rigorous traveling that requires a flexible utility bag. 





WEATHER RESISTANT - Holds up in all weather conditions and can be submerged at 1 ATM. Protected against accidental exposure to water; for example, splashes, perspiration or accidental immersion. 





The simplest solutions solve the biggest problems. What makes us different? We eliminate weight, bulk, and hassle from standard everyday carry bags. We've created an effortless experience between you, and your EDC. 





The outdoors have never been so close. We designed Wolverine to be perfect for hiking, going to the beach, surfing, or climbing- you name it. Get out of town with the buddies, or explore the the endless trails of the outdoors, all with the convenience of your Wolverine.





We combined a sharp, elegant design with breakthrough fabric technology to bring you a perfect day-to-day use Utility Bag. We believe that the shape, and size keep the design minimal, functional, easy to carry, and completely hassle-free in any situation. You can sport it on the subway to your office just as easily as you can take it on a blissful day hike.





 





Designed by combining our break-through Regenerative FuseFabric™ Technology, with the traditional roll/clip bag design, we bring you an ultra durable, easy to carry utility pack for your everyday use.

Original Design Sketches


 





We added a 6 inch tall double layered base to help with durability as well as support for those heavier situations.



Heavy-Duty Nylon & Hardware


Though the bag is quite simple, it has details where it matters. We even opted for a solid silicone logo for water resistance and durability.





OUR MANUFACTURING PARTNERS
We chose our manufacturing partners based on a couple factors. The first and foremost was experience- our partners have had 30+ years of experience manufacturing bags for various big name brands. Once we saw their successful track record with these household names, we were confident in their ability to deliver. 



Fabric Prototyping Options


Secondly, their R&D department was the most advanced we had seen. The FuseFabric was a new development they were able to tweak an customize to our needs. Though self-healing fabrics have been around for a couple years now, they haven't been refined to the point of being fully production ready and field-testable. We needed something strong and durable, but also lightweight and water resistant. 



Our partners have nearly all production processes in house.


Quality and attention to detail were other factors that contributed to their long history of success. We noticed this on full display when we visited in Summer 2017. They were fully transparent and communicative in all steps of the manufacturing process.

<p> Our mission for the past few months was to design the greatest EDC pen ever by combining the functions of a standard tactical pen and a solid pocket knife. This may sound like an easy task but getting all three features to fit on a standard sized pen without making it too top heavy was quite difficult. After many design iterations and prototype productions we came up with this final patent-pending design you see here. </p>
<p>The design of the TriTac EDC Pen cuts no corners in design or materials. Using the highest grade of aluminum or titanium for the body, the Fisher Space ink cartridge for the best writing experience, a 440c stainless steel blade and a tungsten carbide window punch this lightweight pen is easy to carry around and extremely functional. </p>

<p><br/>We are a small team of water-loving individuals. We have strong experience in water activities and sports. More importantly, we have strong experience in business, production, and manufacturing.</p>
<p>Since our company’s creation in 2015, we’ve worked hand-in-hand with world-wide organizations (like the Red Cross) and collected early innovation awards.</p>
<p>Our main goal is to spread awareness and education the world on the importance and severity of water safety. About 42 people worldwide drown every hour. We want to reduce that number.We’ve decided to crowdfund for a few key reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to spread our message and awareness as quickly as possible. Selling OneUp first on a globally recognized platform is a major step in reducing the number of drownings.</li>
<li>We want to get OneUp in your hands as quickly as possible for as low a price as possible. Crowdfunding allows us to do that.</li>
<li>Finally, Crowdfunding is all about you, the audience. Through crowdfunding, we’re able to communicate with you directly, understand your needs from this product, and get your feedback on OneUp.</li>

OUR STORY

We are a small team of water-loving individuals. We have strong experience in water activities and sports. More importantly, we have strong experience in business, production, and manufacturing.
Since our company’s creation in 2015, we’ve worked hand-in-hand with world-wide organizations (like the Red Cross) and collected early innovation awards.
Our main goal is to spread awareness and education the world on the importance and severity of water safety. About 42 people worldwide drown every hour. We want to reduce that number.We’ve decided to crowdfund for a few key reasons:

We want to spread our message and awareness as quickly as possible. Selling OneUp first on a globally recognized platform is a major step in reducing the number of drownings.
We want to get OneUp in your hands as quickly as possible for as low a price as possible. Crowdfunding allows us to do that.
Finally, Crowdfunding is all about you, the audience. Through crowdfunding, we’re able to communicate with you directly, understand your needs from this product, and get your feedback on OneUp.

We can’t wait to get this product in your hands.

As most of you probably know, Mark and I were lucky enough to go to Nepal last year to trek to Everest base camp.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the earthquakes that hit Nepal this year have hurt many of the friends we made there. They are mostly from a region west of Kathmandu called Gorkha, which as you might have seen was the epicentre of the first quake. <br/><br/>The damage was pretty catastrophic. 90% of the buildings in the region were destroyed or seriously damaged. 43 employees of the company we trekked with have lost their homes. 35 schools were destroyed. The almost complete shutdown of the tourist industry meant the overwhelming majority have been out of work for almost 4 months. And that doesn't even mention the 64 loved ones that were killed and injured. For much of the last 3 months our friends and many others have been living in tents and surviving off charity handouts. This is not the beautiful Nepal we saw and fell in love with.<br/><br/>We thought we'd try and raise a bit of cash for them, so in the name of charity (and never having to do another leg day) we're looking to bike 250 miles from Manchester to Edinburgh. I hope I don't need to point out that this is a pretty massive mission, particularly given that one of us was in hospital having lung surgery 3 months ago! We're hoping to make it in 3 days, and promise to upload pics of every beautiful view, impressive sight, and emotional breakdown on the way.<br/><br/>We'd really appreciate it if you would consider donating. The money is going in part directly to the bank accounts of some of our friends there who've lost their homes, and in part to a charity called Sambhav Nepal. Sambhav means 'it's possible' in Nepalese. The charity was set up by the CEO of the trekking company we went with to improve the schools and education in Gorkha, although currently they are more focussed on just enabling the community to get back on its feet. In the 2 months after the earthquake they distributed almost 4000 aluminium sheets and 27,000 kg of rice to those in need.

<p><b>Where are we based |</b></p>
<p>We have a network of volunteers
based in Bristol and London; but our operations office is in a small village
situated in the northwestern region of Cameroon, called <a href=""https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Bambui/@6.0499996,10.233333,7z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x105f3f36a21cd4c7:0x5aa828fb58e20423"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bambui</a>.
This is where we develop the majority of our projects and where our small team
of 5 people operates from.</p>
<p><b>Why Bambui |</b></p>
<p>Bambui is a small village with approximately
10,000 inhabitants, which has risen to 20,000 in the last two years due to the
construction of a University.</p>
<p>Despite enjoying an atmosphere of peace
and slight economic growth, this region is still considered to be the 2nd
poorest one in the country with 30% of its population still living with less
than $1 a day. </p>
<p><b>Why are we different |</b></p>
<p>We don't tackle one problem at a time;
instead we work very closely with the community in developing an integrated
long-term strategy for the general improvement of their living conditions.  </p>
<p>For that reason we have projects in a
varied range of areas, which tackle social, health, environmental and financial
problems simultaneously: </p>

<p><b>How do we do it |</b></p>
<p>We work through local partner
organisations in order to provide support to project implementation. These
local partners are usually non-governmental organisations, local government
departments, small private companies and community based organisations. </p>
<p>We provide:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Bespoke solutions
using the local resources available, and are able to offer financial support by
applying for international grants, providing micro credit and develop projects
with revolving funds; and,</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Training and
technical advice, as well as overall assistance with capacity building,
planning, budgeting and institutional development.</p>
<p>We also act as a cooperation platform,
through which we seek to partner with international organisations available to
link up with local partners.  </p>
<p><b>Why do WE need YOU to help Eva |</b></p>
<p>With the £3,000 that Eva is hoping to
raise for us we can build 6 latrines – one in 6 out of the 18 existing schools.
This means that:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>1,700 children will
have access to proper sanitation facilities for the very first time; and,</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>More than 10,000
people will enjoy from the health benefits that such technology will bring. </p>
<p>This is what latrines look like today in
Bambui schools:</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/459316/files/20140325121704-school_latrines.png?1395775024"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/459321/files/20140325121826-wss_iii.png?1395775106"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

I am 29 years old, originally from Portugal and I live in London. I used to sail in Portugal for regional and national competitions when I was a teenager, I have never been so healthy! I love to travel and I make it my goal in life to conquer as much territory as I can and challenge myself everywhere I go.  I grew up in Ivory Coast, I travelled around north America alone in a rented car, I did South East Asia alone as a backpacker and I've worked in Brazil. It is my dream to travel and take on challenges, so.. I applied for the Clipper Round The World Race 2015 - 2016 and I was accepted! Which means now I need the money to make it become a reality and for that I need your help. Not only to sponsor the race and the costs involved but also to help me raise money for the charity I am supporting with this adventure across the ocean. What is the Clipper Race?Picture, content: All rights reserved to: http://www.clipperroundtheworld.com
This is the only race in the world where the organisers supply the fleet of twelve identical, 70-foot, stripped down racing yachts – each sponsored by a brand – and manned with a fully-qualified skipper, employed to lead the crews safely around the globe.It’s where anyone from any background, culture or age (over 18s) can compete. It’s an experience that will change people’s lives. The sea does not distinguish between Olympians and normal citizens, the crews need to be ready to face exactly the same challenges as those experienced by the pro racer.And, when they return from the biggest challenge they have ever faced, the crews bring home countless lessons with them. The importance of teamwork and the importance of respect. Of giving more than you take. Of learning what your body is capable of. An appreciation of cultures, religions, lifestyles and attitudes that connect with communities right around the globe.Because of its amateur status and varied crew profile, don’t for a moment consider this to be some sort of easy option. The crews have to work hard to become winners and it’s not unusual that boats might finish within minutes of each other after three weeks and 3,000 miles of ocean racing.Pictures, content: All rights reserved to: http://www.clipperroundtheworld.com
My Challenge: South Africa - Australia                              Back on board with tales of diving with great whites, safaris and sampling the best of Stellenbosch, the challenging Southern Ocean will be my home and my challenge for three weeks.About the chosen charity                                   Who we are |
Reignite is a registered charity
in England & Wales established in 2012. 
It was founded with the aim of
lifting rural African communities from poverty by using a multisectorial
approach and valuing local human and natural resources. 
Where are we based |
We have a network of volunteers
based in Bristol and London; but our operations office is in a small village
situated in the northwestern region of Cameroon, called Bambui.
This is where we develop the majority of our projects and where our small team
of 5 people operates from.
Why Bambui |
Bambui is a small village with approximately
10,000 inhabitants, which has risen to 20,000 in the last two years due to the
construction of a University.
Despite enjoying an atmosphere of peace
and slight economic growth, this region is still considered to be the 2nd
poorest one in the country with 30% of its population still living with less
than $1 a day. 
Why are we different |
We don't tackle one problem at a time;
instead we work very closely with the community in developing an integrated
long-term strategy for the general improvement of their living conditions.  
For that reason we have projects in a
varied range of areas, which tackle social, health, environmental and financial
problems simultaneously: 
•  Water & Sanitation, Hygiene &
Public Health;
•  Skills development & Education;
•  Micro-finance;
•  Food & Agriculture;
•  Environment, Biodiversity &
Climate change adaptation; and
•  Promotion of Cultural Heritage.
How do we do it |
We work through local partner
organisations in order to provide support to project implementation. These
local partners are usually non-governmental organisations, local government
departments, small private companies and community based organisations. 
We provide:
· 
Bespoke solutions
using the local resources available, and are able to offer financial support by
applying for international grants, providing micro credit and develop projects
with revolving funds; and,
· 
Training and
technical advice, as well as overall assistance with capacity building,
planning, budgeting and institutional development.
We also act as a cooperation platform,
through which we seek to partner with international organisations available to
link up with local partners.  
Why do WE need YOU to help Eva |
