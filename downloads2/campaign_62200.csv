<p style=""text-align: justify;"">About ten years ago, I woke up and went to have a shower like every morning before work. The weather outside was miserable, the sky was grey, it was cold and wet... and I thought, there must be a better way to start my day?  It was then I realised, <b>I wanted to get more out of my morning shower</b>.</p>

will benefit from better showers at lower costs and contribute to reducing plastic and water consumption. They will take care of themselves and respect nature more. These are people who are always looking for new organic remedies. What they all want is the good of their skin and mind.


Why limit yourself to a common shower experience? 


About ten years ago, I woke up and went to have a shower like every morning before work. The weather outside was miserable, the sky was grey, it was cold and wet... and I thought, there must be a better way to start my day?  It was then I realised, I wanted to get more out of my morning shower.
I dreamt of a shower which was able to mix directly in the water stream fragrances such as jasmine, yang-ylang or ancient and mystic smells of wood and sandal. I dreamt of a waterfall of emotions in which every drop on my body was a caress by nature and in which the aroma was interacting with my mood! In that instant, I was desiring a Moroccan hammam experience condensed in 5 minutes, in my ordinary shower, before going to work.
My ambition was to re-think the idea of the ordinary shower in a more efficient and ecological way and to offer people like me an easy and affordable solution for their skincare regime.
That's why I started my personal Shower Revolution.
I am Luca Sanvittore, a 31 year old new entrepreneur with a background in sociology and psychology. I have always been interested in how smells can interact with a person's mood, memory and sense of well being. I love to improve the quality of my life daily and feeling healthy, while contributing to mindful consumption for a better planet, is important to me.
To make this revolution begin, I had to bring together a team of experts in cosmetics, engineering and product design. After several hours, days, months and years of research and development, we brought to life a simple to use and easy solution based on a patented mixer SmileShower Shaker and specially designed capsules Pop&Go. 


So how does it work?

Connect the SmileShower Shaker between your shower head and hose without any modification 

Once installed, 3 options can be easily selected via a rotating switch at the front of the Shaker allowing you to select:

- just water: reduces water consumption by 30% for each shower thanks to a patented internal system
- stop water: when stops are required it keeps your perfect water temperature and avoids water wastage
- mixed water: when you want to get the most out of your daily shower select mix - water blends with your choice of soaps, shampoo or essentials oils for 3-5 minutes via Pop&Go shower capsule
1. Choose which skincare, haircare or therapeutic Pop&Go capsule is best for you

3. Select mix and GO!
Everything in a capsule
Honed from traditional soap recipes, 'Pop&Go' are special shower capsules which provide an excellent quality of cleaning whilst delivering pure organic body care and wellness products into your shower. Accurately designed to fit and to be mixed into the ShowerShaker, they are all made with natural ingredients and are eco-friendly as they require no plastic packaging.

The capsules are aromatic cleansers which mix a variety of essential oils, skin care and natural fragrances into your water stream for infinitive treatments as part of your every day routine. 
Cleanse, stimulate and invigorate after playing sports or relax and soothe your body after a long day. Our capsules allow you to choose your experience, whether you want to wind down or wake up, have a deep clean or freshen up. 
The water massage combined with essential oils cleans and moisturises your body at the water source, including those hard to reach back and feet areas, giving you an unbeatable cleansing sensation.
Better showers
ShoweRevolution is ideal for better circulation, improves skin tone and is efficient in keeping the whole body moisturised and complexion bright. The effectiveness of skin care depends on the delivery of ingredients deep into the skin. The skin is the most receptive when it is clean, moist and warm because pores and cells gaps are at their widest; this is exactly the condition that a warm, steamy shower environment creates.
In this context, the aromatherapy practice is applied in all its known modes via: 

aerial diffusion 
direct inhalation
topical application

Key benefits 

Protect blue skies and blue seas: every day you reset carbon emissions as you will not use any more plastic containers for your skin care products, whilst reducing foam by 50%

Protect your energy bills: you save up to 50%* of water for each shower and it's a money saver every time you use it

Travel the world with your shower: you can finally bring your favourite shower experience with you when travelling for business or pleasure


Create a different experience every day: customise your shower using hundreds of soaps and fragrance combinations

* The optimum shower experience using Pop&Go lasts up to five minutes; within this frame of time you can get the most out of your shower whilst dramatically reducing water wastage.

None of the organisers get paid for their efforts; 100% of the proceeds are spent on the festival. </p><p>We've lost a lot of money in the past, organising more than our budget could cover. If the festival is to survive, we need to be more strict about where the money goes. This funding thermometer shows you what we'll be doing with your money. We can only make an activity happen if we can fund it. By donating, you'll make the level rise and once we reach the goal for an activity, we'll organise it.

</p><p>€5,000: Wonderland - We'll go all out and make sure the festival grounds are wonderfully decorated.</p>
<p>€7,500: Take a Load Off - This year, you'll be able to get a massage, beauty advice and get properly pampered.</p>
<p>€10,000: Picture Perfect - With your help, all individual photo shoots can go ahead as planned.</p>
<p>€12,500: Hugs ’n’ Kisses - Find friends or love with our new, social activities including speed dating.</p>

Stories like this are why the event needs to continue growing. What We Need & What You GetWe need to raise at least €15,000. Every last cent of the money we raise goes directly into the festival. We need it to organise activities and to pay for things like security, power supply, permits, decoration, et cetera. None of the organisers get paid for their efforts; 100% of the proceeds are spent on the festival. We've lost a lot of money in the past, organising more than our budget could cover. If the festival is to survive, we need to be more strict about where the money goes. This funding thermometer shows you what we'll be doing with your money. We can only make an activity happen if we can fund it. By donating, you'll make the level rise and once we reach the goal for an activity, we'll organise it. So, you have the power to make things happen! And if we break the meter and raise more than our goal, that just means more and better activities and maybe a little nest-egg for next year!The goals you can help us reach are:
€5,000: Wonderland - We'll go all out and make sure the festival grounds are wonderfully decorated.
€7,500: Take a Load Off - This year, you'll be able to get a massage, beauty advice and get properly pampered.
€10,000: Picture Perfect - With your help, all individual photo shoots can go ahead as planned.
€12,500: Hugs ’n’ Kisses - Find friends or love with our new, social activities including speed dating.
€15,000: Time to Say Goodbye - For the first time, there'll be a closing ceremony and after party on Sunday so you can say goodbye to the friends you won't see until Redhead Days 2015!In return, you will get some amazing perks. You can choose T-shirts, jewellery, VIP arrangements and much more. Whether you can spare €1 or €1.000, there's always something you can get. This image shows you some of perks you can choose. Click here to see the gallery, which shows more perks!Other Ways You Can HelpDon't worry if you can't afford to donate!

Monti Iblei areas and in particular the subarea of 'Valle dell'Irminio'. The olives used produce an extraordinary P.D.O.

Fossa di Lupo is an Extra Virgin Olive Oil from South East Sicily.
Matthew and Marianna which are professional not related to the agriculture industry in any manner (Naval architect & Interior designer respectively), are aiming at producing a new range of their produce to celebrate the birth of Lavinia, our first child born in July.It is our wish to improve the outcome of our crop, since due to poor weather conditions this year, our total harvest is 75% less than 2013.Your contributions will be invested to improve the crop for the 2015 harvest by introducing new composting techniques, careful irrigation, pruning, and general TLC during the Sicilian drought months from may to September...... 
Our Story
Marianna and Matthew are relatively new to the Agriculture sector, having worked as an interior designer and as a naval architect respectively.Marianna's passion for her land (Sicily) and her roots have led her together with Matthew to start up and develop the manufacturing and selling of Ultra Premium Extra Virgin Olive Oil into a business.We have been at it since December 2012, having met a series of milestones over these 2 years: 

P.D.O. Certification.  Demonstrating the quality and pureness of our produce,


Bio/Organic certification:  We are two years into the compulsory 3 years required for Organic certification.  This process shall be complete by end of 2015, when we will officially have the Bio/Organic certification.

Following medical advice, I have endured heart surgery at 19, two bone surgeries at 30, a hysterectomy at 40, my stomach, pylori muscle removed and two hernia repairs on June 30, 2014. Tomorrow, I find out if my gallbladder needs removal. The results came back and my gallbladder was removed. I am still in the hospital after nine days. The list of tests is too long and horrible. During two of the tests, my heart stopped.  Currently, I am 43 years old and I am continuously attached to a feeding pump which provides nutrition and hydration through a port in my abdomen. It is NOT working. I cannot keep any weight on my body.</div><div>In my ""past"" life, I had a master's degree in special education. I was honored to receive Teacher of the Year for Every year I taught. One year, I even received Teacher of the Year for the entire county! I love teaching. It is a job I would do for free and I taught for over ten years. </div><div>The doctors here in the USA do not have any more options for me. They have started talking ""life expectancy"" issues.

Following medical advice, I have endured heart surgery at 19, two bone surgeries at 30, a hysterectomy at 40, my stomach, pylori muscle removed and two hernia repairs on June 30, 2014. Tomorrow, I find out if my gallbladder needs removal. The results came back and my gallbladder was removed. I am still in the hospital after nine days. The list of tests is too long and horrible. During two of the tests, my heart stopped.  Currently, I am 43 years old and I am continuously attached to a feeding pump which provides nutrition and hydration through a port in my abdomen. It is NOT working. I cannot keep any weight on my body.In my ""past"" life, I had a master's degree in special education. I was honored to receive Teacher of the Year for Every year I taught. One year, I even received Teacher of the Year for the entire county! I love teaching. It is a job I would do for free and I taught for over ten years. The doctors here in the USA do not have any more options for me. They have started talking ""life expectancy"" issues. I heard about a special program being offered in India in which they are having positive results...Cures!!! I started doing it and have done as much of the program as I can here. In just a matter of weeks, I have been able to start taking sips of water.

<p>My father, Tom Redd age 54, was diagnosed with stage III, liver cancer on Oct 15<sup>th</sup>, 2012.  We need to raise at least $10,000 to cover the cost of his medical expenses and medications. In addition, my mom will need to take time off from work during the last few months of my Dad's life, so they will need some money for living expenses (she cleans houses for a living, so she has no paid sick leave or vacation time.)  Lastly, because this is a terminal disease, there will be a need to cover funeral expenses.</p>
<p>Tom Redd is a loving father of two who has devoted his life to raising my sister and me. When he and my mother brought me into this world, they had nothing more than the clothes on their backs and a tiny roof over their heads. After having my sister my father knew he would need to support his new family. Starting from practically nothing, he built a concrete construction company that would, over the next 27 years support all of us.</p>
<p>Over the past three years, with the economy the worst its been in decades.  Work for my father has slowed to almost a halt, and his company and home are now in jeopardy of being taken. My parents have never had much money and no savings. </p>
<p>This situation has only worsened since his discovery of liver cancer. Since October he has been unable to work at all, and his condition has been increasingly getting worse. Without financial help, my father and all that he has worked for will die. My mother will be left with huge medical bills and will most likely have to sell the house and business. I could never explain through this, my love for my father and mother, and the pain I feel in watching my parents suffer after all they have given me. Having to watch as everything they own is being sold, has broken my heart and has barely covered a fraction of the medical cost already incurred. My father has never asked for any charity, and still would not, so it is my responsibility to help him and my mother through these tough times and ask what they can not.</p>
<p>Although my Dad has catastrophic health insurance, my parents cannot keep up with the costs of his end-of-life health care.  My father raised me to be honest and hardworking and regardless of what we raise I will fight till the end for my family. That’s why I am only asking for $10,000 in hopes that we can easily reach it. And maybe exceed it. Any thing raised will be a huge help, so no donation is too small.</p>
<p>My Father is only 54.  His 55<sup>th</sup> birthday is this week. This is my present to him, so please help us make his final days more comfortable.  Life is short and precious, any donation helps so please, help us in these difficult times.</p>

</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Brenda. I am 63 years old and I've been
always healthy all my life. I had flu just once in a blue moon. Never been hospitalized nor had any surgery. I used to be full of life and happy as I can be, like in my picture above. Suddenly all went downhill!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Main Picture<br/>
</h3>
<p>Back in March of this year, one night I felt totally
different and I was having difficulties breathing. I right away called an
ambulance. They showed up in no time and transported me to the nearest hospital
which was only 10 minutes away. All I remember from that night being wheeled
through the hallways of the hospital and I passed out.  When I opened my eyes, I was lying on a hospital
bed, a close friend of mine was standing next to me. He said that I had a
massive heart attack, doctors saved me and I am going to be OK now. They were so much in panic, and lost hope
for me to survive, they almost attempted to get in touch with my daughter for
funeral arrangements.</p>
<p>Later, I've been told that I was in coma
for 13 days. Every time doctors tried to bring me back, my heart was pounding at
200. A doctor later will describe  my heart as a race horse galloping.  And besides, my sugar levels went through the
roof at an unbelievable 800. I practically owe my life to live close to the
hospital, the quick response time of the ambulance and the wonderfully talented
team of doctors on calls that night and God of course.</p>
<p>To keep me alive, they had to use ""propofol"" (that is what ended Michael Jackson's life) to
hold me in induced-coma until my heart responds in a better way and in the
meantime they didn't want to perform an open heart surgery because of my
weak condition and placed a double metal stent next to eachother in one of my arteries as a viable
solution at that moment. I still have
another artery blocked in a way that it is not an immediate threat for now. That gives me enough warning that I have to be careful and stay in alert for future complications.<br/></p>
<p>During my stay in the hospital, I couldn't walk at the beginning and it
was very hard to even stand up. Also while having my heart attack, in the ICU,
they had to pull my few teeth supporting my partial dentures, to create the
easy access for all tubing and gadgets they have inserted through my throat. </p>
<p>All this time I was still hallucinating
under the propofol influence (it’s common to last over a year) they have
administrated. Besides all I started to have a reaction as non-stop hiccups at
the hospital and the reasons cannot be identified. Just imagine yourself hiccuping
non-stop 24 hours a day. I couldn't
sleep, had hard time eating and drinking the little I can. Hiccups lasted over
2 weeks and suddenly disappeared as they started. Still no one knows what
triggered. Once I went home to continue recovering, I was able to walk with a
walker and my hands were shaking really badly. I needed both hands to hold a
cup and it was really tricky even to use a spoon. It took over 3 months to get
less symptomatic and back to a decent level of health.  I am still really careful driving, no further
than couple of miles, just for grocery shopping.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I used to earn my living as a free-lance web site and
graphic designer which requires advanced computer skills and great mental
creativity and I was really good at it, as I was told. I couldn't perform my assignments because of
my shaking hand, trembling fingers, and couldn't even put together my thoughts and concentrate due to the medications
administered during my coma.  In result, I've
lost many web site maintenance contracts that I had, some customers thought that I was
dying and they simply cancelled. Therefore my income dropped drastically. </p>
<p>Finally I am able to start working with my computers in a
slower pace than I used to. At least I did start to create an income.</p>
<p>As of now I am creating enough income to barely pay my rent
and amenities and food. I am on 8 different important medications that I am
having really hard time to pay for (no insurance).</p>
<p>All I am asking for a little help, a little push to keep me
floating until I catch up or at least come close to the income I used to make. I am
predicting that I will reach a better level of income within 6 to 8 months,</p>
<p>Now that I don't have any teeth and no dentures (partial
ones are useless when there is nothing to anchor), I need a full set of denture
to look decent to meet potential customers for new
assignments, not to mention even go out in public, </p>
<br/><h3>Where the Money Will Go<br/>
</h3>
<p>The amount of $2300 that I am asking will be allocated to
cover expenses as follows:</p>
<p>- 6 months of medication (3 different ones for my
type 2 diabetes, 5 heart related ones which I have to take for the rest of my
life). $600 is estimated to support to cover what I cannot come up with. Their actual cost is way more than that.<br/></p>
<p>- Full set of dentures so I can look presentable in the
meetings etc. $1400 is just enough for low end ones.</p>

- 2 specialist doctors’ visits  for the next 6 months, $169 each. I don't have
insurance anymore.<br/><br/><h3>Final Thoughts<br/>
</h3>
<p>As I mentioned I managed to start earning an income of few dollars monthly so far, but I need a
short term support to come closer to my potential. I think God gave me another
chance to live and with your kind support, I will be able to be around
longtime. This girl needs a heartfelt boost to be herself again. <br/></p>
<p>With all my gratitude and appreciation.<br/></p>

Finally I am able to start working with my computers in a
slower pace than I used to. At least I did start to create an income.
As of now I am creating enough income to barely pay my rent
and amenities and food. I am on 8 different important medications that I am
having really hard time to pay for (no insurance).
All I am asking for a little help, a little push to keep me
floating until I catch up or at least come close to the income I used to make. I am
predicting that I will reach a better level of income within 6 to 8 months,
Now that I don't have any teeth and no dentures (partial
ones are useless when there is nothing to anchor), I need a full set of denture
to look decent to meet potential customers for new
assignments, not to mention even go out in public, 
Where the Money Will Go

The amount of $2300 that I am asking will be allocated to
cover expenses as follows:
- 6 months of medication (3 different ones for my
type 2 diabetes, 5 heart related ones which I have to take for the rest of my
life). $600 is estimated to support to cover what I cannot come up with. Their actual cost is way more than that.
- Full set of dentures so I can look presentable in the
meetings etc. $1400 is just enough for low end ones.

- 2 specialist doctors’ visits  for the next 6 months, $169 each. I don't have
insurance anymore.Final Thoughts

As I mentioned I managed to start earning an income of few dollars monthly so far, but I need a
short term support to come closer to my potential. I think God gave me another
chance to live and with your kind support, I will be able to be around
longtime. This girl needs a heartfelt boost to be herself again. 
With all my gratitude and appreciation.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>For over
10 years, Dr. Boris Gorbunov the company founder and an internationally
renowned expert in nucleation/condensation technology with more than 150
technical R&amp;D publications and patents, has been leading a research team to
develop breakthrough Nanoparticle Biomarker Tagging (NBT) detection technology:
a technology that reads biomarkers emitted from a person’s breath to detect
illnesses like Cancer and Tuberculosis.  Exhaled breath contains a complex
mixture of molecules produced by body fluids called “biomarkers” which can be
used to identify the existence diseases and conditions. </p>
<p>The

Meaning In Words Data Analysis Canada Inc., is a start-up company 
        
          registered in Canada. 
      

        Meaning In Words (MIW, pronounced 'me-you') explores the nature of connections.
On a personal level, with two description of each other (me and you) MIW can identify how we may relate to each other.
        With direction it can identify strengths and weaknesses in our connections. 
On a cultural level, it can help us
        explore meaning in words and ideas. Through use of language, MIW may assist us to understand something about human nature.
      




What is MIW?


MIW is an engine that understands the meaning of words through their connections to other words.
Through word association, MIW enriches text and quantifies it for analysis.
MIW understand the:

closeness in meaning between words
closeness in meaning between descriptions
meaning of words through their definitions
meaning of ideas through their descriptions




How do I use it?


MIW comes with a range of applications: 




Explore words and their relationships. Use it for education, art, poetry, writing songs, whatever you want...




Describe a situation. And observe possible emotions that may arise.




Two humans give their description of the same situation. MIW shows which emotions might be experienced by each human. MIW helps to identify emotional disconnects, and suggests emotional bridging.




Achieve literary harmony by identifying and modifying words that make undesired associations.(User is required to specify what is undesirable)




A set of tools to assist statistical analysis of text in academic research.




A set of tools for exploring abstract ideas and themes.




I look forward to hearing your ideas and suggestions.

EMOTIONS

              I was curious about emotions and how they relate to each other. After a quick search
              I found Dr. Bradley Nelson's list of 60 emotions. I used these definitions to make the 
              following plot.
              



EMOTIONAL BRIDGES: Example



For example, after a meeting, two people can give a short description of the other person. 
                    And MIW can identify emotional relationship between the two.

In 1973 ferro yacht “Helsal” won the Sydney to Hobart yacht race.Few years ago we did a crowdfunding campaign, but when it comes to building a tall-ship you never deny extra financial help.Now we are soooooo close to launching “Batkivschyna-2” in the water as ever! It’s 90% done and almost ready for launching. All what it needs is an ENGINE!  That why we turned to crowdfunding.After searching for an appropriate engine we came to conclusion that the best choice would be a marine diesel engine “TDME-4108”, 90 hp., 2500 rpm/min.It costs 9000 $ US.Please, help us make it happen!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Anett Gyenge (33) and Gergely Barta (32) made Shetland their
home in 2012. You may have been served by Anett, recognised by her striking red
hair, she is a waitress and barmaid at the Shetland and Lerwick Hotel. For the
last few years Gergely, known as Gery, has worked at the Scalloway Meat Company
shop and more recently also at the Thule Bar.  </p>
<p>Anett and Gery were traveling to Hungary on holiday and
broke their journey in Stuttgart Germany. They decided to do some
sightseeing and while they were touring a church it started to rain. Anett
slipped on wet cobbled steps outside the church and hit her head badly. She had
to be airlifted to Ludwigsburg hospital where she was put into an induced coma
for 2 weeks, the doctors performed a laryngectomy to help her breath and
removed part of her skull. </p>
<p>Anett and Gery did not have travel insurance,
only the blue, National Insurance issued, EU health insurance cards, Gery does
not speak German, he does not know what the EU health insurance card will cover
and what it won’t cover but what he really needs is money right now to help with day to day living costs.</p>
<p>All of their savings have now been used up on
the cost of him staying with her at the hospital. The Hungarian Government will
not help them because they have lived in the UK too long and paid their taxes
here. He has not been able to contact the UK government services for help. </p>
<p>Anett is now out of her coma but is unable to
talk, write or walk. She cannot remember what happened. She still has to
undergo an operation to place an implant over the gap in her skull. They have
to remain in Germany until she recovers from the implant operation and this
means that they are in real trouble financially. </p>
Friends of the couple have set up this crowd
funding account to bring Anett home to Shetland. Please can you help?<br/></div>","One of our Hungarian Shetlanders Needs Help.

Therefore, it is hard to reach with traditional vibration massage devices because they tend to only reach the surface level tissue layer. However, STRIG's microcurrent technology sends low-level electrical currents(25uA) that mimic the body's own natural electrical current which helps in stimulating the deepest muscle layers. The microcurrents emitted from STRIG also help reduce the build-up of lactic acid which can help prevent muscle soreness when used in advance.</p><div data-href=""https://youtu.be/m03whzPiU7o""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""344"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/m03whzPiU7o?feature=oembed&amp;wmode=transparent"" width=""612""></iframe></div></div><p>iPhone and iPad use capacitive touch screens.

Unlike traditional “low frequency vibration” or “hammer impact motion” massage devices, STRIG incorporates micro-vibration technology to accelerate muscle relaxation and promote the growth of muscle fibers. STRIG also emits micro currents throughout the muscle to reduce the build-up of lactic acid in order to prevent muscle soreness.    Strig’s curvature design was designed by a team of physical therapists who have devoted a lot of time and energy into product research. Its ergonomic design molds perfectly to any body type while allowing you to press directly onto the muscle and get to at those hard to reach areas. Strig is also designed to help everyone obtain professional-quality massage treatments whether you’re at home, the office, the gym, or any other location.We believe that having access to professional quality massages at an affordable price is something that everyone deserves.Microcurrent is a Nobel Prize-winning therapy for muscle pain management. STRIG's microcurrent technology was developed to precisely mimic the human body's natural electrical properties; it helps re-boost your biological electrical system.Source :  https://bit.ly/2XdOjHVThe human muscle layer is located beneath the skin and fat tissue layers (Epidermis, Dermis and Subcutaneous tissue). Therefore, it is hard to reach with traditional vibration massage devices because they tend to only reach the surface level tissue layer. However, STRIG's microcurrent technology sends low-level electrical currents(25uA) that mimic the body's own natural electrical current which helps in stimulating the deepest muscle layers. The microcurrents emitted from STRIG also help reduce the build-up of lactic acid which can help prevent muscle soreness when used in advance.iPhone and iPad use capacitive touch screens. These screens use a finger's electrical conductivity to disrupt the screen's own electrostatic field. So that is why STRIG can unlock the iPhone passcode because it emits microcurrents. In contrast, the traditional massager can’t unlock the iPhone passcode since it doesn’t emit microcurrents. General Blade-type Massage Tools vs. STRIGThe general blade-type massage tool(for IASTM) is made for professional use, because, in order to use it, you are generally required to have professional massage certification to locate and treat the damaged areas with the appropriate amount of pressure. However, Strig is designed to add micro-vibration technology to the blade-type massage tool, which helps you to experience a professional-quality massage with ease, even if you don’t have professional knowledge and skills.STRIG increases the temperature of the area that is massaged by generating friction heat. This heat promotes greater blood circulation in the treated area which allows for more nutrients and oxygen to be delivered to the damaged muscle tissues. Through this, the muscle tissues are stimulated properly and the cells repair themselves at a faster rate.Both hammer impact motion massager and blade-type massager differ in the way they impact on an object. As you can see from the thermal sensor images, most massages implement the use of a ball or hammer shape to create high impact on a specific hitting point. This does not stimulate the muscles evenly and can be very painful. STRIG’s blade design is designed to mold perfectly to any body so that you can experience a massage that can be performed evenly throughout the targeted area. Strig has three adjustable levels of micro-vibration intensity to meet your needs depending on the designated massage area. One press of a button will allow you to change the intensity of your massage.               As a physical therapist who has been treating patients in hospitals for over 10 years, I became very accustomed to using different IASTM tools. Traditional IASTM tools allows the user to release Myofascial pain (a fancy word for muscle pain) through soft tissue mobilization. Since 2015, my team and I have trained physical therapists as well as those in training and also helped each person create tools that suited each individual's style. The IASTM tools I was using were somewhat effective and easy to use, but they did not synergize well with the Graston technique, which I specialized in.

<p><strong>THE PROBLEM AND THE SOLUTION</strong></p>
<p>As I start my day, I look through my EDC collection and face a hard decision as to what to carry. Perhaps, like me, you feel certain products fit your mood or situation better than others that day? Like the practicality of a ring spinner when driving, or the unassuming nature of a desk spinner when at work?</p>
<p>By leveraging my experience in designing products, I created a fully functional, modular device that solves this carry dilemma. Each aspect of the design functions perfectly, as each individual item would if bought separately. The transition between function remains seamless.</p>

The Impact

Before my first treatments, my doctors recommended that I harvest and freeze my eggs. Not only did I not have the funds to do this, but because I was so sick and the cancer was at stage 3, this was not an option for me. Starting a family of my own is no longer an option.

What I Am Asking

As of right now I am still receiving phone calls and letters daily and weekly form debt collectors, still not knowing how to pay them, or the on coming debt. My goal is to raise a minimum of $10,000. The money that i will be receiving from all of you wonderful and generous people will be used to help pay for my chemo, bone marrow transplant, medication, picc line, injections, lab testing, scan testing, co-pays, and gas to and from my treatments. 

 
I would like to say thank you to all of those who have helped and who are helping. A few dollars might not seem like much, but those few dollars could pay for another injection, or test that is needed. I would also like to say thank you to everyone for all of your love, support, prayers, wishes, and thoughts, they are more appreciated than you know!!!

<h3 style=""font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 0, 204);""><font size=""4"">Our Story</font></h3>
<h3>Hi there! We are the Ebling's, Amber and Rob. We met each other when Rob
 was 18 and I was 20... our relationship started as a wonderful 
friendship, full of fun times and big laughs. We were married in July of
 2000 (Rob was 22 and I was 24) , we still had big dreams for our 
future; finishing school before having children being a must! So as I 
finished up getting my Bachelors degree the baby fever hit! And it hit 
hard!  I researched everything I could about trying to conceive 
naturally and the adventure began! Well we had no idea what a 
heartbreaking adventure it would turn out to be. After a year &amp; a 
half of no success on our own we decided to look into fertility options.
 Things started out pretty easy and not incredibly expensive. Our doctor
 recommended we start with IUI which consists of taking my husbands 
sperm weeding out the imperfect swimmers and putting it directly into 
myself (this way those swimmers have less hurdles to go through to reach
 my egg). Well after 3 failed attempts at $400 buck a try (not including
 the 2 ultrasounds each cycle at $200 each), our doctor said we should 
consider the next step: In vetro fertilization. So in 2006 we decided to
 take all of our savings and give it a shot. $13,000 got us our doctor 
visits and ultrasounds covered, the retrieval of my eggs and the 
transfer of any fertilized eggs into my uterus.We were fortunate enough 
to have 23 eggs retrieved from my uterus 19 of which fertilized 
successful That $13,000 did cover all the transfers until those 19 eggs 
had all been used, it did not cover any of the numerous and expensive 
medications that I had to take each time we did a transfer.  These 
medications we an added up to an additional expense of $500-700 each 
time.  <br/><br/>We went into this process full of hope and excitement! 
For us it was the thought of ""how could this not work??"", well to our 
surprise our first transfer of 3 eggs was not a success along with our 
second, also of 3 eggs. On our 3rd attempt we were amazed and delighted 
with a positive blood pregnancy test!! Although when the nurse called to
 tell us the news she said ""it is positive, but it is a very low 
positive"". Any number less than 5 is considered a negative for pregnancy
 and anything above 25 is considered a good positive. Ours came back at a
 12 so we were in that grey area. Once you have a positive number come 
back you have to have a blood test every other day to determine if it is
 a healthy beginning, if it is that number should double every other 
day. Our second test came back at 19, not a good sign and from there it 
decreased back down to zero resulting in an early loss of the pregnancy.<br/><br/>So
 again we picked ourselves up and decided to try again, we still had 
frozen embryos and we were not going to let them go without a fight. 
This time we transferred 4, we were less concerned with multiples 
considering none had survived so far. This time we again had a positive 
test result.... but it was low... AGAIN! We went for two weeks having 
tests that the numbers just never seemed that good. Our Dr. decided for 
us just to have and ultrasound to see what exactly was happening. What 
she found was and empty uterus, failed again! And to make things worse 
it seemed as though that little egg had decided to embed itself in to my
 fallopian tube instead. So now I had an ectopic pregnancy (only happens
 about 5% or less with in vetro)  that even if it was a good embryo, it 
would not be able to survive. I had to be given a shot that was 95% of 
the time suppose to dissolve the remainder of the pregnancy so that I 
wouldn't have to have it surgically removed. Well a couple of weeks 
later I had such an intense pain in my abdomen that my doctor ordered me
 to the emergency room in my town. There the nurse stated that she 
really didn't see anything that concerned her, she gave me Vicodin and 
sent me home. That night I was in such excruciating pain that I could 
hardly stand. In the morning we again called our Dr. who said go back to
 the emergency room, I refused because of the treatment I received the 
night before and told here we would drive the 2 hours to her office. 
When I got there and had the ultrasound done my Dr. calmly walked out of
 the room for a moment then came back and said "" I've called for an 
ambulance, you will have to have emergency surgery. Your abdomen is 
completely filled with blood and this is life threatening"". I was rushed
 into surgery to have the ruptured fallopian tube and the remains of the
 pregnancy removed. When I woke from surgery I remember asking about my 
tube.... did it have to be removed?? Without it I would only be able to 
get pregnant naturally 6 times a year instead of 12. So great, I lost one tube.... I'm 
even more infertile!<br/><br/>After that we actually felt excited to try 
again because we had revived a positive result, we thought it was a good
 sign! So in 2009 we again transferred 3 frozen fertilized eggs.... 10 
days later we got wonderful news a blood test result of 29!! We were 
bouncing off the walls! Our next test came back at 56, but the nurse 
said we had tested just shy of 48 hours so it should be just fine. Our 
3rd blood test came in well above the 116 we needed, so our doctor said 
let's schedule you for a 5 week ultrasound. Things were going perfectly 
and we couldn't be any happier!! At our ultrasound we got to see the 
fetus and had measurements taken to see if it's growth was were it 
should be. Sadly we were told that it was measuring a week behind and 
that we shouldn't keep our hopes up for it being a viable pregnancy. We 
left that visit with heavy hearts but still clinging to hope of a 
miracle for us. The next week our Dr. was shocked to see that growth had
 continued (even though it was still about a week behind), and to our 
surprise we were able to hear the heartbeat! I will never forget the 
surprised look on our Dr.'s face and the uncontrollable tears of joy 
that were streaming down Rob &amp; my faces. We were going to have our 
little miracle! We left that visit talking of the future and how 
wonderful it would be!!<br/><br/>That excitement was short lived, within 2
 weeks I began to have some bleeding that concerned us so we made an 
appointment to have it checked out. The ultrasound showed that the 
growth had slowed considerably and as our Dr. searched we came to the 
horrible realization that the heartbeat could no longer be found. I was 
only 9 weeks along but to my husband &amp; I both, we felt as though we 
had lost a part of ourselves.<br/><br/>Now we are faced with what our Dr. 
believes are an issue with my eggs. Although I am still young 35, my 
eggs are acting as though they are much older. Our Dr. believes because 
of my many positive tests that I am able to carry a pregnancy, I just 
need healthy eggs to do it. So we have been left with the option of 
using a donors eggs with my husbands sperm, this would allow me to carry
 the pregnancy. I have always dreamed of carrying our child and Rob 
often talks of how he would love to see my body grow and change with 
life inside of it. We have been together 15 years, 11 of those married. 
We are each others best friends and have always wanted to have a family 
of our own. But the amount of money it has cost us so far (upwards of $60,000, no of which insurance covers) has left us 
with nothing to show for it other then broken hearts. We are asking for

Hi there! We are the Ebling's, Amber and Rob. We met each other when Rob
 was 18 and I was 20... our relationship started as a wonderful 
friendship, full of fun times and big laughs. We were married in July of
 2000 (Rob was 22 and I was 24) , we still had big dreams for our 
future; finishing school before having children being a must! So as I 
finished up getting my Bachelors degree the baby fever hit! And it hit 
hard!  I researched everything I could about trying to conceive 
naturally and the adventure began! Well we had no idea what a 
heartbreaking adventure it would turn out to be. After a year & a 
half of no success on our own we decided to look into fertility options.
 Things started out pretty easy and not incredibly expensive. Our doctor
 recommended we start with IUI which consists of taking my husbands 
sperm weeding out the imperfect swimmers and putting it directly into 
myself (this way those swimmers have less hurdles to go through to reach
 my egg). Well after 3 failed attempts at $400 buck a try (not including
 the 2 ultrasounds each cycle at $200 each), our doctor said we should 
consider the next step: In vetro fertilization. So in 2006 we decided to
 take all of our savings and give it a shot. $13,000 got us our doctor 
visits and ultrasounds covered, the retrieval of my eggs and the 
transfer of any fertilized eggs into my uterus.We were fortunate enough 
to have 23 eggs retrieved from my uterus 19 of which fertilized 
successful That $13,000 did cover all the transfers until those 19 eggs 
had all been used, it did not cover any of the numerous and expensive 
medications that I had to take each time we did a transfer.  These 
medications we an added up to an additional expense of $500-700 each 
time.  We went into this process full of hope and excitement! 
For us it was the thought of ""how could this not work??"", well to our 
surprise our first transfer of 3 eggs was not a success along with our 
second, also of 3 eggs. On our 3rd attempt we were amazed and delighted 
with a positive blood pregnancy test!! Although when the nurse called to
 tell us the news she said ""it is positive, but it is a very low 
positive"". Any number less than 5 is considered a negative for pregnancy
 and anything above 25 is considered a good positive. Ours came back at a
 12 so we were in that grey area. Once you have a positive number come 
back you have to have a blood test every other day to determine if it is
 a healthy beginning, if it is that number should double every other 
day. Our second test came back at 19, not a good sign and from there it 
decreased back down to zero resulting in an early loss of the pregnancy.So
 again we picked ourselves up and decided to try again, we still had 
frozen embryos and we were not going to let them go without a fight. 
This time we transferred 4, we were less concerned with multiples 
considering none had survived so far. This time we again had a positive 
test result.... but it was low... AGAIN! We went for two weeks having 
tests that the numbers just never seemed that good. Our Dr. decided for

<h3>To Live Pain Free</h3>
<p>Our daughter, Courtney, doesn't remember what it's like to live without pain or fear of pain.  She will be 15-years-old in October and has only had nine pain-free days in the last eight years.  Those nine days came after being in the hospital for four days.  Every day she wondered, ""Will today be the day?""  That's not to say that she let it rule her life, it was just always there, in the back of her mind.  She took full advantage of those nine days, and to see her happy and pain-free was the greatest joy our family had known in quite some time.  That was a year and a half ago.  Almost every day since then, her pain level has increased, and never gone away.  She keeps thinking that she has experienced the worst pain she could ever imagine, only to discover that it can get worse.  I cannot begin to imagine living with the constant pain our beautiful daughter suffers... she desperately wants to know what it is like to live without it.</p>
<p>It all started with four simple words, ""I have a headache.""  Considering that she always said it at the end of the school day, we did what any parent would do~ took her to the eye doctor.  Sure enough, she needed glasses.  Sadly, the headaches just kept coming... every, single day.  Eventually Courtney was diagnosed with migraine headaches.  Blood work, MRI, CT scan, nothing ever showed a cause, there was no explanation.  Being the strong, amazing child she is, she has never let her pain stop her.  It might slow her down, but she picks up speed eventually. A straight A student, lover of nature, writer, future scientist, and so much more, she hopes and dreams big.  She has gone through her days with a smile on her face, always reaching for the stars.</p>
<p>Courtney has been hospitalized four times in less than three years.  It is always a grueling experience and the results always temporary.  Although pain has never affected her performance when it comes to school work, it has greatly affected her ability to attend school.  From fourth through seventh grade, she missed no less than 18 days of school per year.  Her eighth grade year, she became homebound for three months.  Although she managed to finish the last month of the year at school, her summer has been spent able to do little more than lie on the couch, wishing the pain away.  She has had a few good~ although not pain-free~ days, and when she does, she takes full advantage, only to suffer the next several days.  She starts high school in less than three weeks... she desperately wants to finish her freshman year with her friends, pain-free.</p>
<h3>The Mayo Clinic and Beyond</h3>
<p>Her doctor has done all he can.  Another four day hospital stay, with temporary results and dangerous medicine is not the answer.  We are glad for this.  The Pain Management Center at Children's Medical Center Dallas told us there is nothing they can do... except refer us to the Mayo Clinic for a three week Pain Rehabilitation Program.  The Mayo Clinic is a long way from Dallas, TX, and three weeks is a long time.</p>
<p>We want to be able to take Courtney to The Mayo Clinic... we need your help.  Without your help, there is no way we can afford to get her the treatment she needs. Although we have insurance~ and assuming they will pay for the program~ they do not pay until we have met an out-of-pocket expense of $3,500.  Add this to airfare, lodging, transportation, and food for two, for three weeks... it adds up rather quickly.  As a result of Courtney's many hospitalizations, as well as her dad~ my husband~ having had a heart attack, leading to open heart surgery on July 3 of this year, we have aquired an enormous amount of medical bills.  Being able to pay for the treatment Courtney needs, as well as, the medical bills we have already acquired, would allow us to start saving money so that she can go to college.  As I said, she dreams big, she wants to be a scientist!  .  </p>
<p>Because we have been assured that the Pain Rehabilitation Program is quite successful, we have high hopes that, with your help, Courtney will be able to live her life free of constant, severe pain.</p>

Our daughter, Courtney, doesn't remember what it's like to live without pain or fear of pain.  She will be 15-years-old in October and has only had nine pain-free days in the last eight years.  Those nine days came after being in the hospital for four days.  Every day she wondered, ""Will today be the day?""  That's not to say that she let it rule her life, it was just always there, in the back of her mind.  She took full advantage of those nine days, and to see her happy and pain-free was the greatest joy our family had known in quite some time.  That was a year and a half ago.  Almost every day since then, her pain level has increased, and never gone away.  She keeps thinking that she has experienced the worst pain she could ever imagine, only to discover that it can get worse.  I cannot begin to imagine living with the constant pain our beautiful daughter suffers... she desperately wants to know what it is like to live without it.
It all started with four simple words, ""I have a headache.""  Considering that she always said it at the end of the school day, we did what any parent would do~ took her to the eye doctor.  Sure enough, she needed glasses.  Sadly, the headaches just kept coming... every, single day.  Eventually Courtney was diagnosed with migraine headaches.  Blood work, MRI, CT scan, nothing ever showed a cause, there was no explanation.  Being the strong, amazing child she is, she has never let her pain stop her.  It might slow her down, but she picks up speed eventually. A straight A student, lover of nature, writer, future scientist, and so much more, she hopes and dreams big.  She has gone through her days with a smile on her face, always reaching for the stars.
Courtney has been hospitalized four times in less than three years.  It is always a grueling experience and the results always temporary.  Although pain has never affected her performance when it comes to school work, it has greatly affected her ability to attend school.  From fourth through seventh grade, she missed no less than 18 days of school per year.  Her eighth grade year, she became homebound for three months.  Although she managed to finish the last month of the year at school, her summer has been spent able to do little more than lie on the couch, wishing the pain away.  She has had a few good~ although not pain-free~ days, and when she does, she takes full advantage, only to suffer the next several days.  She starts high school in less than three weeks... she desperately wants to finish her freshman year with her friends, pain-free.
The Mayo Clinic and Beyond
Her doctor has done all he can.  Another four day hospital stay, with temporary results and dangerous medicine is not the answer.  We are glad for this.  The Pain Management Center at Children's Medical Center Dallas told us there is nothing they can do... except refer us to the Mayo Clinic for a three week Pain Rehabilitation Program.  The Mayo Clinic is a long way from Dallas, TX, and three weeks is a long time.
We want to be able to take Courtney to The Mayo Clinic... we need your help.  Without your help, there is no way we can afford to get her the treatment she needs. Although we have insurance~ and assuming they will pay for the program~ they do not pay until we have met an out-of-pocket expense of $3,500.  Add this to airfare, lodging, transportation, and food for two, for three weeks... it adds up rather quickly.  As a result of Courtney's many hospitalizations, as well as her dad~ my husband~ having had a heart attack, leading to open heart surgery on July 3 of this year, we have aquired an enormous amount of medical bills.  Being able to pay for the treatment Courtney needs, as well as, the medical bills we have already acquired, would allow us to start saving money so that she can go to college.  As I said, she dreams big, she wants to be a scientist!  .  
Because we have been assured that the Pain Rehabilitation Program is quite successful, we have high hopes that, with your help, Courtney will be able to live her life free of constant, severe pain.

<p><strong><br/></strong>Hello, my name is Jimmy Burton and i am a close friend and co-worker of Bruce Connors. Bruce has been working with us for over 30 years, and you could say he is the glue that holds this place together. Everyone loves Bruce, and if you could only meet him, you would see why. Not only is he a light that shines at our office, but Bruce's contributions go beyond that. Bruce also cares for his wife and grandchildren through his work. Many family members depend on his income. We are starting this campaign in hopes of helping support Bruce and his family in these tough times. Recently, Bruce has suffered a stroke and has lost all movement in the left side of his body. His spirit is still lively, but his body simply will not cooperate. The much needed monthly income he provided was a life line for his family. Now that he is bed ridden, it is up to us to help him! In these tough economic times, with a family to support, Bruce couldnt afford health insurance, and as you can imagine, the bills are piling up. Please help us help the man who has shown so bright in our lives. Please help us support his family! Lets help him recover by taking the burden of family needs off of his shoulders, a burden he couldnt possibly carry in this moment.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>iFitnessWise is about matching exercise and diet strategies that are a good fit for your personality; approaches that will feel easy and natural rather than being a struggle every day.</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>There are no one-size-fits-all answer for fitness. </b><br/></p>
<p><span>What works for you is unlikely to work for your friends. That is because you have different personalities. iFitnessWise helps you select and manage a fitness strategy that is natural for your personality.  As a team we have worked with all sides of personality research and sports psychology.  From our experiences in the NFL and MLB, there is no such thing as ""one size fits all"".</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Why most programs do not work for you:</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>So, you might start an exercise program by joining a gym or by following a fitness guru, never quite feeling like the program is right for you. Then after a month or two, you quit going to the gym (even though you paid for a year) or you give up on the guru.</span></p>
<p>Or you go for a stringent diet style that worked for a friend or celebrity and cut out every food you love just to lose ten pounds, but then you cannot take it anymore and you binge on your favorite foods (and lots of other not-so-favorites). You give up any semblance of trying to eat better and you just decide why bother?</p>
<p>The holidays are especially tricky for most people with their diet and exercise programs. It is understandable that most people make resolutions in the coming January, and many of them are health related, after all, a New Year means a clean slate. The problem is that most people try to accomplish everything at once using a program that is never going to work for them in the long run because it does not match their fitness personality. Do not disregard your resolutions, instead use iFitnessWise to help direct you to a strategy that will finally help you accomplish your 2014 fitness goals!</p>
<p>The all-or-nothing attitude is one of the reasons we are starting iFitnessWise. The overriding idea of iFitnessWise is this - change your fitness program to match your personality, not the other way around.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/85983/files/20130920080615-howstarted.png?1379689575"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Two longtime friends, Pam and Sterling, started talking...</span></p>
<p><span>Pam has a Master's degree in Exercise Science and knew that the old standards for the type and amount of exercise were more than most people could attain, and therefore very few people were even attempting to exercise at all, let alone getting fit. </span></p>
<p><span>Sterling is a founder of Step Research - developers of psychology software, and an expert with personality type. He is on the Board of Directors for the Association of Psychological Type International. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The software created by Step Research is used by sports professionals in the NFL draft and MLB draft to understand which players are the right fit for a team. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">So, Pam and Sterling had a lot to talk about. And the more they talked together the more they knew that the relationship between their areas of expertise could help others.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/85984/files/20130920080633-whyshoes.png?1379689593"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span><b>When the shoe fits…<br/></b></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We set out to create an easy and memorable way for people to remember their iFitnesswise match. In almost any exercise program you have to have the right footwear. We chose shoes to represent each personality, and to match them to strategies that fit. The shoe is just a mascot, not a rule.</span></p>
<p>Here are short descriptions of two of the eight broader fitness personality styles to give you an idea of how iFitnessWise will work for you and your friends.</p>

<p><span>People do not gain weight or get into unhealthy habits overnight, yet we expect results after a week, or worse yet, a couple of days. Most people do not realize that small dietary changes or a little extra activity can make a huge difference in the long run.</span></p>Can pretty much everyone add some activity into their lives? Probably. Can most people go even further with the “right” exercise program for them? Again, probably. Especially if you get some help from iFitnessWise so that your program matches your fitness personality.<p></p>

<h3>Your pledge will allow us to create and get the detailed Coaching Reports to you for your New Year’s Resolution in January 2014.</h3>
<p>We are going to build this application regardless of meeting our funding goals. Without hitting our funding goal then this project will have to be a labor of love and will take as long as necessary with everyone’s busy lives.  </p>
<p>By hitting our funding goal we know that not only do other people want it, but that they are willing to pay for it. This means we can begin to build a rich and varied product suite to help people. As a business we can support this product.</p>
<p>Take a look at our planned product development with the stretch goals below.</p>
<p>We would love for iFitnessWise to give you the coaching you need whenever you most need it. It is important to us that iFitnessWise fits into your life seamlessly, while still being a useful tool for you. Once you find out what works for you, we hope that iFitnessWise becomes a tool for people who want to lose weight, be fit, and communicate with others about their experiences.</p>That is what iFitnessWise is all about...helping you find out what you enjoy doing/eating, etc. (or at least not dreading). And over time, we hope that being a part of the iFitnessWise community makes you “fitness wise”, not only about fitness, but what works specifically for you.<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><span><b>Please support us!<br/></b></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Help everyone who has struggled to stay fit know that there is a way to get fit and lose weight that matches their personality. If you know someone who supports fitness, or who has struggled with fitness, then help us spread the news about this project! Please help educate people that their fitness personality does affect what programs will work for them.<br/></span><br/></p>

<h3>Where did the name come from? </h3>
<p><span> Well, it started out of a meeting between Sterling (our personality type expert), James (our web/art designer), and Pam (the fitness expert). We were discussing the challenges people have with exercise. At one point, James said, “well, you really have to enjoy what you are doing “fitness-wise”. Of course he is right. If you enjoy what you are doing, you are more likely to keep doing it. Now, onto figuring out what works for you!</span></p>
<h3>What is done already:</h3>

<p><span><b>$6,000</b> At this goal we will develop an Email Tips feature into our application that reminds you of the optimal fitness, exercise and diet strategies for you.

<p><b>$10,000</b> For this goal we create an Athletic Partner Comparison Coaching Report, automatically available to anyone at the $5 level or higher. If you like to work out with other people, this comparison report will show your coaching reports side by side and helps you know if your buddy or buddies are matched with the type of fitness approaches that suits you.</p>
<p><b>$15,000</b> At this goal we will build in goal setting and journaling features to the coaching reports to help you stay on track. These goals integrate with the Email Tips from the earlier stretch goal so that you are reminded of your goals, just a like a good coach would do.</p>
<p><b>$20,000</b> For this goal we create a special interface and tools for Fitness Professionals, eg. Exercise Coaches, Diet Experts, Personal Trainers, Dieticians, Nurses, Doctors. This is a great tool for anybody who is certified and/or helping others with their fitness. This will include a special forum or discussion area where these professionals can collaborate. We will probably charge for this additional business service, and anybody at the $75 backer level or higher will get free access for 6 months.</p>
<p><b>$25,000</b> For this goal we update the Email Tips system to also be a Text Tips system. As with the Email Tips, any backer of $10 or more gets the product free for a year.</p>
<p><b>$30,000</b> At this goal we make each detailed coaching report longer, this would add an additional page to each coaching report, adding roughly 10,000 words to the coaching report writing effort.

It would be wonderful if it was so easy and convenient for everyone to find an activity or program that matches their fitness personality whenever they need it.</p>
<p><b>$50,000</b> For this goal level we will create the ability for you to privately discuss and comment on your coaching report with the people you designate.  Then you can have a coaching dialogue with the people you care about.</p>

<p><b>$75,000</b> We would add a child-focused psychological assessment that parents can give to younger children (below age 13) and use to match approaches to their child’s natural style.

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>Step Research Corporation, the company behind the quiz and the software at SmarterAboutPeople.com, is an experienced psychological software company. We have already built and delivered several products designed for large companies including working with NFL and MLB professional sports teams. This puts us in a good position to take on the risks and challenges that will arise -- and as with any project, experience tells us a few problems likely will.</p>
<p><b>Here is what we can anticipate as potential problems:</b></p>
<p><b>Writing The Coaching Reports:</b> The writing could take longer to execute than we are hoping it will, or could simply manifest in a fashion we find unsatisfactory (requiring a 'do-over'). Writers are people with real lives and those lives come with schedule-complicating problems. If any delay looks like it will be short, we will likely roll with it, and we will let you know what is happening. If it looks like something long, we have an assortment of other writers we have worked with over the years who can step in to help achieve the deadlines.</p>
<p><b>Hosting and Servers:</b> Our company is very focused on up-time and stability for all our products. We partner with Rackspace as a top provider of hosting and servers to manage this particular area. They have a stellar reputation in the industry and their unparalleled customer service is something we prize in them as a partner.</p>
<p><b>The Art:</b> The custom art for those reward levels could take longer to execute than we are hoping it will. James might have complications from college or his work as a radio talk host and some other schedule-complicating problems. If any delay looks like it will be short, we will likely roll with it, and we will let you know what is happening. If it looks like something long, we have a number of other artists who can assist.</p>
<p><b>Software:</b> The software could take longer than expected to customize. Snags could occur in the code that was not anticipated. If any delay looks like it will be short, we will likely roll with it, and we will let you know what is happening. If it looks like something long, we have an assortment of other development teams we have worked with over the years who we know can execute quickly and on-time for a deadline.</p>
<p><b>Finances:</b> Thanks to the success of our other projects, Step Research Corporation is a solvent software company. We have already spent $10,000 on customization getting the iFitnessWise beta to this point, and now we are asking the Indiegogo community to help us get this launched much faster and to fund the great stretch goals.</p>If there is any risk or challenge you can think of that we have not mentioned here, please write in and ask. We love to answer questions, and we do our best to provide an unparalleled customer service experience whenever possible.<br/><p></p>

iFitnessWise is about matching exercise and diet strategies that are a good fit for your personality; approaches that will feel easy and natural rather than being a struggle every day.


There are no one-size-fits-all answer for fitness. 
What works for you is unlikely to work for your friends. That is because you have different personalities. iFitnessWise helps you select and manage a fitness strategy that is natural for your personality.  As a team we have worked with all sides of personality research and sports psychology.  From our experiences in the NFL and MLB, there is no such thing as ""one size fits all"".

Why most programs do not work for you:

So, you might start an exercise program by joining a gym or by following a fitness guru, never quite feeling like the program is right for you. Then after a month or two, you quit going to the gym (even though you paid for a year) or you give up on the guru.
Or you go for a stringent diet style that worked for a friend or celebrity and cut out every food you love just to lose ten pounds, but then you cannot take it anymore and you binge on your favorite foods (and lots of other not-so-favorites). You give up any semblance of trying to eat better and you just decide why bother?
The holidays are especially tricky for most people with their diet and exercise programs. It is understandable that most people make resolutions in the coming January, and many of them are health related, after all, a New Year means a clean slate. The problem is that most people try to accomplish everything at once using a program that is never going to work for them in the long run because it does not match their fitness personality. Do not disregard your resolutions, instead use iFitnessWise to help direct you to a strategy that will finally help you accomplish your 2014 fitness goals!
The all-or-nothing attitude is one of the reasons we are starting iFitnessWise. The overriding idea of iFitnessWise is this - change your fitness program to match your personality, not the other way around.





Two longtime friends, Pam and Sterling, started talking...
Pam has a Master's degree in Exercise Science and knew that the old standards for the type and amount of exercise were more than most people could attain, and therefore very few people were even attempting to exercise at all, let alone getting fit. 
Sterling is a founder of Step Research - developers of psychology software, and an expert with personality type. He is on the Board of Directors for the Association of Psychological Type International. The software created by Step Research is used by sports professionals in the NFL draft and MLB draft to understand which players are the right fit for a team. 
So, Pam and Sterling had a lot to talk about. And the more they talked together the more they knew that the relationship between their areas of expertise could help others.



When the shoe fits…We set out to create an easy and memorable way for people to remember their iFitnesswise match. In almost any exercise program you have to have the right footwear. We chose shoes to represent each personality, and to match them to strategies that fit. The shoe is just a mascot, not a rule.
Here are short descriptions of two of the eight broader fitness personality styles to give you an idea of how iFitnessWise will work for you and your friends.

Canvas Shoe Fitness Personality


Access the beta immediately, take the quiz to get your fitness personality quick card for free! http://app.smarteraboutpeople.com/start.php








Here is an example of a detailed report that is customized with more specifics tailored for your unique fitness personality.





People do not gain weight or get into unhealthy habits overnight, yet we expect results after a week, or worse yet, a couple of days. Most people do not realize that small dietary changes or a little extra activity can make a huge difference in the long run.Can pretty much everyone add some activity into their lives? Probably. Can most people go even further with the “right” exercise program for them? Again, probably. Especially if you get some help from iFitnessWise so that your program matches your fitness personality.



Your pledge will allow us to create and get the detailed Coaching Reports to you for your New Year’s Resolution in January 2014.
We are going to build this application regardless of meeting our funding goals. Without hitting our funding goal then this project will have to be a labor of love and will take as long as necessary with everyone’s busy lives.  
By hitting our funding goal we know that not only do other people want it, but that they are willing to pay for it. This means we can begin to build a rich and varied product suite to help people. As a business we can support this product.
Take a look at our planned product development with the stretch goals below.
We would love for iFitnessWise to give you the coaching you need whenever you most need it. It is important to us that iFitnessWise fits into your life seamlessly, while still being a useful tool for you. Once you find out what works for you, we hope that iFitnessWise becomes a tool for people who want to lose weight, be fit, and communicate with others about their experiences.That is what iFitnessWise is all about...helping you find out what you enjoy doing/eating, etc. (or at least not dreading). And over time, we hope that being a part of the iFitnessWise community makes you “fitness wise”, not only about fitness, but what works specifically for you.

Please support us!Help everyone who has struggled to stay fit know that there is a way to get fit and lose weight that matches their personality. If you know someone who supports fitness, or who has struggled with fitness, then help us spread the news about this project! Please help educate people that their fitness personality does affect what programs will work for them.





Pam Canavan: Mother with a Masters in Exercise Science who has a passion for helping people be healthier and happier as themselves.





James Canavan: Actor (he is in the video!) and Radio Show Host, Student, Graphic Designer and someone who desperately needs this software to work.





Sterling Bates: Personality Expert (on the Board of Directors for the Association for Psychological Type International), owner Step Research Corporation and software system architect.  Step Research creates psychological software and works with professional sports teams like the NFL and MLB. (Sterling has also been focused on exercise and health since developing Type 1 diabetes at age 8.)





Gene Bellotti: A partner at Step Research with a Masters in Counseling and Consulting Psychology, and 20 years marketing and advertising with tech startups who found a fitness program that matched his personality.





Rodney Smith: The new guy at Step Research. Rodney has a Masters in Video Game Design (Production), and over 13 years experience as a competitive gymnastics coach.



Where did the name come from? 
 Well, it started out of a meeting between Sterling (our personality type expert), James (our web/art designer), and Pam (the fitness expert). We were discussing the challenges people have with exercise. At one point, James said, “well, you really have to enjoy what you are doing “fitness-wise”. Of course he is right. If you enjoy what you are doing, you are more likely to keep doing it. Now, onto figuring out what works for you!
What is done already:

We have already done the vast bulk of the psychological and fitness research. The software and system have been architected. The core application and psychological assessment have been designed to leverage resources from Step Research which already does psychological software for professional sports like the NFL and MLB. 
The beta is available right now for you to test at our software partner!http://app.smarteraboutpeople.com/start.php

About Ovarian Cancer
Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of gynecological cancer deaths in Australia. Each year more than 1200 Australian women are diagnosed with 800 women will die
On average 3 Australian women are diagnosed every day. Approximately 75% of women are diagnosed at an advanced stage, where the cancer has spread and is difficult to treat successfully. Currently only 40% of women diagnosed with ovarian can-cer will be alive five years after diagnosis.
If ovarian cancer is diagnosed early, up to 80% of women will be alive and well after five years.

The four most commonly reported symptoms are:



Increased abdominal size or persistent bloating


Unexplained abdominal or pelvic pain


Difficulty eating or feeling full quickly


Needing to urinate often or urgently



Some women experience additional or different symptoms. You should let your doctor know if you have any other symptoms that are not usual for you these may include:



Changes in bowel habits


Unexplained weight loss or gain


Vaginal bleeding


Back pain.


Indigestion or nausea


Excessive fatigue



The majority of women who experience these early symptoms do not have cancer. However, it is important that you seek medical advice if the symptoms persist. IF YOU HAVE THE ABOVE SYMPTOMS FOR MORE THAN 2 WEEKS YOU SHOULD SEE YOUR GP.
Survival
Every woman with ovarian cancer is treated as an individual case, depending on the stage of the disease and other personal factors. It is therefore very difficult to give a general prognosis.If the cancer is diagnosed and treated early, between 80-100% of patients will survive for more than five years. But only approximately 30% of women diagnosed at advanced stages will survive for more than five years. See 'How is Ovarian Cancer Treated?' for further information about survival rates.



The five year survival rate for Australian women with ovarian cancer is only about 40%


In comparison, the five year survival rate for breast cancer is about 88%



THERE IS NO SCREENING TEST FOR OVARIAN CANCER. A PAP TEST IS USED TO DETECT CERVICAL CANCER IT DOES NOT DE-TECT OVARIAN CANCER. THIS IS A COMMON MISUNDERSTANDING BY A LOT OF WOMEN AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE EDUCATE WOMEN ABOUT THIS.",0.0,2,"7 Campaigns

little russian girl who has a rare genetic desease CCHS (congenital

</div>
<label id=""fund-descp-lb""></label>Hello!<br/>
My name is Helena and I m the mother of the little girl Daria, now she 
is 1 year old.All this year she has been living in the hospital and during 11 
months she was alone lying in the intensive unit as the parents are 
allowed to see the child only for 2 hours.We live in Russia, in a small 
town Kstovo not far from Nizhny Novgorod. Our story began in January 
2011, we ve been waiting for our little girl and on the 16th january she
 was born. On the second day her breathing stopped and she was switched 
on to the ventilator. Next day in a very grave condition she was taken 
to the intensive unit care in Nizhny Novgorod's hospital. After the 
examination and therapy she could not breathe herself anyway. Every week the doctors switched her off from the ventilator and every time we hoped for a miracle that she can breathe but unfortunately it did not happen. And the doctors did not know what kind of the desease she has. Only some weeks later one of the doctors supposed that she has CCHS (congenital central hypoventilation syndrome) and told us to have a genetic analysis that proved it and it is turned out that she has 20/27 polyanine expansion and since then she is 24 hours ventilator dependent as she can not breathe herself. We went to Moscow to one of the scientific centers, after examination of her medical report they agreed to accept Daria in their center but only if we would have a home ventilator, then they could teach us how to manage her at home and we could take our little girl home afterwards. But actually the norms for caring the children with CCHS are unknown in our country as we have two cases only at the moment. I ve found in the internet that children with the same desease live at home having this home ventilator and later on when the child is 4-5 years old the operation for pacemaker implantation can be made abroad. Due to the enormous help of ordinary people we could buy at last this ventilator from Germany ( here we dont have any insurance covering or help from the government). So at the moment I live with her together in the hospital and I m so happy to see her lovely smile every morning. But Moscow center does not have a bed for us at the moment and we don't know for how long we could wait. In our country there is no specialists in CCHS.One of our friends contacted the clinics in Europe and at last we've got the invitation from a UK clinic in North Staffordshire, they have a big experience in managing children with CCHS . They will do the full examination of Daria's condition and will teach us how to manage her properly when we are back home and one of the most important thing as well that they would help us to treat her neurodevelopmental delay as here she was switched off by the doctors each time her brains suffered a lot and as a result she a hydrocefalia (liquid in brains). Being 1 year olds she still does not hold her head, does not sit. I strongly want  to believe that  we could be able to fundraise  the necessary sum for her coming to UK and treating her and maybe there the miracle will happen and she can breathe herself when awake as most children do having the same 20/27 polyanine expansion. We all know to breathe is to live and I hope my daughter will live a normal life. We began the fundraising in our country with the help of ordinary people in social network but the sum for the treatment is quite big 113,520 pounds for 2 months stay. So if anyone of you could donate to Daria we would be very greatful to you! and we could transport her faster to UK as until now she is not well examined and every day we are afraid for her condition. Thank you all in advance for your kind hearts!<div><br/></div><div><h3>The Impact</h3></div><div>Daria is a very positive and smiling girl, she still does not know what is to sit, to stand as she has a neurodevelopmental delay as well, but she wants to LIVE and to BREATHE and she has a CHANCE for this!

<br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The clinic in UK also is ready to provide parents with the accomodation, they will only need to buy meals for themselves and they can stay with her daughter 24-hours! We made a goal for 98000 USD as it is the cost for 1 month stay in UK, the doctor said the minimum time for Daria stay there is 2 months, but we hope to get the second part of the sum in our country with the help of people too.

<p><span>If you have ever met Marilyn Giardino Zych, she is most likely the most eccentric, creative, and passionate person you know. She is a film maker, clown, mother, dancer, painter, singer, teacher and she is still growing and gaining knowledge at the age of 65. As Marilyn's daughter, she inspired me continuously showing me that life is what you make it, that no matter how rough or ugly things become, staying positive and believing can truly bring you to the other side of it. She also showed me that the key to life is to continue to learn and do so passionately. She never hesitated to try something new and if I can even be half as ambitious as she is, I know I will be truly happy. One thing in particular she taught me was to give to others. She always gave to others, even when she barely had anything for herself. She always taught me to follow my heart and to treat others with compassion.</span></p>
<p> Marilyn has been diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer. Due to her illness she is unable to continue working and is undergoing treatment and therapy. Our father has had to take time off of work as well. He has been driving her to all of her appointments, staying by her side at the hospital, and waiting on her hand and foot. Any and all donations are greatly appreciated, no matter how small.</p>
<p>UPDATE: During the beginning stages of our campaign, it became clear to Marilyn and her doctors that if additional immediate action was not taken, the outcome of the treatment she had planned would not be as beneficial as we had hoped due to the rate at which complications were arising. About one week into fundraising, Marilyn went to a treatment center that deals with cancer patients on a one on one basis, and provides treatment designed specifically for the individual's type of cancer and stage. Thanks to all of YOU, Marilyn has completed her first week of treatment and says that the pressure in her stomach is already lessened. While we have reached our Indiegogo goal, we hope to continue to raise funds for her. The more money we make, the more time she will be able to stay at the treatment center. We are overwhelmed and so incredibly grateful for all of the generosity and support we have received, we thank you truly from the bottom of our hearts.</p>
<p> The impact:</p>
<p><span>Your contribution will add exponentially to Marilyn’s life. This is a part of my sister and I’s secret dream; to come to her in 35 days and show her how many people love and support her, and that there is something that my sister and I can do to make this better. When a family member becomes suddenly and seriously sick it’s easy to imagine how one begins to feel hopeless but this is our way to do something concrete, meaningful, and incredibly beneficial for her.</span></p>
<div><span> Other ways you can help:</span></div>

Have you or a loved one been diagnosed with cancer? What’s Next?
“Kick Cancer in the Can with Diane” is a new Web series that follows a typical working wife and mother as she’s hit with a sudden existential dilemma: a diagnosis of breast cancer. A remarkably upbeat actress and Hollywood dresser to the stars, Diane Weisman bravely shares her hopes, fears and bewilderment about the dizzying array of cancer information now available on the Internet. What's real, what’s a hoax? Must Western medicine and Eastern alternative therapies conflict? Diane, her husband Craig and their two boys learn about water quality, the effect of sugar on tumors, special healthy diets such as macrobiotic eating, yoga and other relaxation techniques, chemotherapy, radiation and surgery — all while maintaining an upbeat attitude and sense of humor.



 The Impact
Getting a cancer diagnosis makes a huge impact on anyone's life. It’s a tremendous challenge, but Diane Weisman wants others to know they’re not alone. ""Kick Cancer in the Can"" will strive to answer many questions, including:
- What road do we take after diagnosis? 
- Are there prevention techniques and successful ways of battling cancer not commonly known?
- What are the differences between traditional Western medicine and Eastern alternatives?  
- What happens if you have an HMO, or a PPO — or no insurance at all?
Along with celebrity guest stars and cooking segments, “Kick Cancer in the Can with Diane” is compelling, informative and entertaining. Follow Diane in real time as she faces an arduous journey in her quest for answers, addressing not just questions about cancer, but about how to live a life worth living.

<p><span>SeaStat is a water monitoring instrument designed to use multi-use optical sensors to test alkalinity, temperature, and turbidity. Think of it as a tiny--but smart--robot that wants to show you the general quality of your drinking water in your apartment, the creek next to your campsite, or even the questionable glass of water provided at your next business meeting. Now we need your help to get this into production. </span></p>
<h1><img alt=""CAD Drawings"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/679537/pictures/full/20130226103600-Photo_on_1-28-13_at_3.24_PM__2.jpg?1361903765"" src="""" style="""" title=""CAD Drawings""/></h1>
<h1>Why this is awesome</h1>
<p>We believe everyone should know the general quality of their water, regardless of expertise or budget. Wherever we go--to the beach, to another country, to a hotel--we rarely know how clean our drinking water is. Our only sense is what we can directly observe. That is only part of the problem. </p>
<p>The other part is that nearly all water quality instruments on the market are either expensive, overly complex machines that are used primarily by field scientists or  ""consumer-friendly"" kits that give you a bunch of test strips. Neither option is low-cost (test strips get expensive in the long run), effective for the average consumer, convenient, easy-to-use, or accessible. </p>
<p><img alt=""3D Model"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/679535/pictures/full/20130226103521-Perspective_1.jpg?1361903726"" src="""" style="""" title=""3D Model""/></p>

All our parts are durable, low-cost, and energy efficient. The cool factor is that you'll be able to control it from your cell phone! It gives the readings in an easy-to-view format and in understandable language. This is really the first testing device meant for the average consumer. </p>
<h1>How it works</h1>
<p>SeaStat is incredibly easy to use. Pop out the glass vial located at the top by pressing down on an adjacent button. Fill it with water (as much as possible) and slide it back in. Next, connect SeaStat to your phone via the headphone jack, press the On/Off button, and that's it! You can choose which test you want to run by either pressing the Function button on the SeaStat or selecting the test on the phone application.</p>
<p>SeaStat runs three tests: pH (or alkalinity), turbidity, and temperature. Why these three? These are the most powerful and indicative tests without requiring complicated laboratory equipment. All three help indicate pollution, survivability of bacteria, and suitability for drinking. Temperature is important for swimmers and fishermen because it affects how much oxygen is in the water and how well pollutants can last. The pH, which measures the acidity of water, reveals if the water is changing chemically. Turbidity is the amount of suspended particles that scatter light in a solution. Testing for turbidity can reveal the presence of microscopic organisms and inorganic human-generated matter.</p>
<h1><img alt=""Base Model"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/679533/pictures/full/20130226103508-cad1.png?1361903712"" src="""" style="""" title=""Base Model""/></h1>

<li>Custom-made circuit</li>
<li>Energy efficient processor</li>
<li>Digital calibration, high accuracy</li>
</ul><h1>Why we need your help</h1>
<p>This project is on KickStarter for a few reasons. First, we need $2,400 to finish building our prototypes. While we have made parts of SeaStat, we have not had the financing to construct a full working model. Right now, we are refining the circuit design in order to better integrate the pH electrodes without expanding the physical space. Second, we need about $8,000 to manufacture the first 50 models. We are working with a manufacturer right now to bring down assembly costs and provide a guaranteed delivery date. Lastly, we want to know this has some market appeal before we harass family and friends for donations. This way, this page acts tests the concept of SeaStat. </p>
<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p><strong>Where can I use this?</strong></p>
<p>Anywhere! The beach, your hotel, on a boat. Maybe you're traveling overseas and want to test the drinking supply. All you need is some physical water to test.</p>
<p><strong> How do I control it?</strong></p>
<p>From your phone. Just press the ""on"" button and away you go. Right now, the iPhone applications are in development but should be done by June. An Android version will come out the same time. </p>
<p><strong>Will it work with my iPhone?</strong></p>
<p>It will work with the iPhone 4, 4s, and 5. We apologize that we will not be able to support an earlier model. </p>
<p><strong>I have a suggestion. </strong></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: xx-small;""> Hi, I'm Brook Dillon.  I work, I write, I play music and I'm healthy.  But, this is not about me.  It's about Tristan Myra Mejia.  She is the mother of my child, a respected make-up artist, and my ex.  (She prefers Tristan but, also goes by  Myra)  </span></span></span></p>
<p><span style=""color: #000000;""><span style=""font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;""><span style=""font-size: xx-small;""> I didn't find out about Tristan's stroke until about 2 weeks later.  Why?  Because, she didn't want me to worry.  This is what she told my son.  Obviously, I found out and was immedeately floored, upset and speechless.  After seeing her at the rehab center I realized that her recovery will probably take longer than just a month.  She can remember some of our names but, not all of us.  She knows what she wants to say but, can't get it out.  She can lift up her right arm but, movement and single finger movement is limited.  She can't walk without a walker and not without help (see video).  I can't explain the pain I feel for her because this is an injury she had no control over and to see her struggle with normal everyday things gives me such a knot in my stomach.</span></span></span></p>
</li>
<li> I want to raise enough money to pay for at least two months rent and hopefully 3 so, Tristan can concentrate on rehab to get back to 100 percent (hence the link name) </li>
<li> Tristan doesn't have insurance (as so many people don't, except through medi-cal for this incident).  </li>
<li> Your contribution will allow her to get her health back sooner and continue a normal life.  Rehabilitation is so important when you have a stroke.  It is imperative that you have continual physical and mental therapy as well as mental stimulation (95% of your functions return within the first 2-3 months).  Her profession requires a lot of use of her right hand (which she doesn't have much of at this time) and a lot of socializing as well. She has to work on both these things and get them back to 100% to be able to function well within her occupation.</li>
<li> She is making good progress but, it needs to continue.  She will be released from the rehab center this friday.  Her not worrying about rent will in turn allow her to have a succesful rehab.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Perks aren't the main focus but, Try I will!</h3>
<ul>
<li>All of the money that is raised from this campaign will be directly paid to Myra's landlord for rent.  If an excess amount of money is raised it will be applied for up to 4 months of rent ($8000.00) and the rest will be applied to a charity towards stroke research.</li>
<li>I made a CD, ""Pick n' choose"", back in 2004.  My son is going to try and come up with some pieces of art that we can give as perks as well.  I will apply one of these for any donation over $15.00 at this point.  If I find it's cheaper to ship them, then I will lower the amount required for a perk.  My main concern is to hurry and get this campaign started.</li>
<li>I will also send each and every donater a free digi upload of my next CD that I put out.  It will be called Catastrophe carnage.  I'm hoping for it to be released within 6-8 months.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>If you can't donate, please feel free to give me information on good rehab facilities for home, good rehab/trainers.  If you are a qualified rehab person who wants to donate your services, that would be considered as well.</p>
<p>If you are someone who can help through goods donation, that would be great as well.  Natural remedies, vitamins, etc. and or ""brain"" food would be great!  I hope to get Myra on a strong natural diet that will help keep her blood thn so any goods or helpful information will be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>Whether you apply money, goods, or information towards my campaign, it will all be going not only towards Tristan's cause but, the cause of better education towards all who involve themselves!</p>

 I didn't find out about Tristan's stroke until about 2 weeks later.  Why?  Because, she didn't want me to worry.  This is what she told my son.  Obviously, I found out and was immedeately floored, upset and speechless.  After seeing her at the rehab center I realized that her recovery will probably take longer than just a month.  She can remember some of our names but, not all of us.  She knows what she wants to say but, can't get it out.  She can lift up her right arm but, movement and single finger movement is limited.  She can't walk without a walker and not without help (see video).  I can't explain the pain I feel for her because this is an injury she had no control over and to see her struggle with normal everyday things gives me such a knot in my stomach.

 I want to raise enough money to pay for at least two months rent and hopefully 3 so, Tristan can concentrate on rehab to get back to 100 percent (hence the link name) 
 Tristan doesn't have insurance (as so many people don't, except through medi-cal for this incident).  
 Your contribution will allow her to get her health back sooner and continue a normal life.  Rehabilitation is so important when you have a stroke.  It is imperative that you have continual physical and mental therapy as well as mental stimulation (95% of your functions return within the first 2-3 months).  Her profession requires a lot of use of her right hand (which she doesn't have much of at this time) and a lot of socializing as well. She has to work on both these things and get them back to 100% to be able to function well within her occupation.
 She is making good progress but, it needs to continue.  She will be released from the rehab center this friday.  Her not worrying about rent will in turn allow her to have a succesful rehab.

 


Perks aren't the main focus but, Try I will!

All of the money that is raised from this campaign will be directly paid to Myra's landlord for rent.  If an excess amount of money is raised it will be applied for up to 4 months of rent ($8000.00) and the rest will be applied to a charity towards stroke research.
I made a CD, ""Pick n' choose"", back in 2004.  My son is going to try and come up with some pieces of art that we can give as perks as well.  I will apply one of these for any donation over $15.00 at this point.  If I find it's cheaper to ship them, then I will lower the amount required for a perk.  My main concern is to hurry and get this campaign started.
I will also send each and every donater a free digi upload of my next CD that I put out.  It will be called Catastrophe carnage.  I'm hoping for it to be released within 6-8 months.

 


Other Ways You Can Help


If you can't donate, please feel free to give me information on good rehab facilities for home, good rehab/trainers.  If you are a qualified rehab person who wants to donate your services, that would be considered as well.
If you are someone who can help through goods donation, that would be great as well.  Natural remedies, vitamins, etc. and or ""brain"" food would be great!  I hope to get Myra on a strong natural diet that will help keep her blood thn so any goods or helpful information will be greatly appreciated!
Whether you apply money, goods, or information towards my campaign, it will all be going not only towards Tristan's cause but, the cause of better education towards all who involve themselves!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Nanomedications are developing and can continue to develop as fundamentally single element molecules and particles. But, efforts are being made to mix these nano-particles with other ineffective medications or unnecessary additional nano-particle substances. This may seem illogical till one looks at the issue from a patent and profit driven perspective.

Scroll down to learn more about these new perks.
America's biggest problems are going unsolved because our government is overrun by Big Money special interests and lobbyists. The amount of money corrupting our political system is at an all time high, so we're setting out to make ""fixing the corruption"" the #1 issue in America. Enter, Gil Fulbright. Gil is a satirical Senate candidate — an ""honest politician"" who will openly take any position on any issue... for the right price. We're running Gil for Senate in Kentucky during the most expensive Senate Race in American history between Senator Mitch McConnell and challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes.As seen on...Why Kentucky? (Note: We're sending Honest Gil to New Hampshire to help take down a sold-out candidate, but Gil is still running in Kentucky and will continue his campaign there through November.In NH, we're partnering with Lawrence Lessig's crowdfunded Mayday PAC to help them achieve their mission of a Congress committed to fundamental election reforms in 2016. They've carefully selected a handful of races for 2014, and invited us to help tip the scales in a New Hampshire primary where one candidate is committed to fixing our corrupt political system, and the other is a notorious Big Money sellout.We set out to get people in Kentucky, and across the nation, talking about fixing our corrupt political system. Because of the overwhelming success of our campaign to date, we've decided to go even further.)The race between McConnell and Grimes is on pace to cost an unprecedented $100 million. Over three quarters of both candidate’s money is coming from outside of Kentucky, including a who's who of big money special interests. When it costs that much to win an election, the candidates become dependent on their funders, not on the people they're supposed to represent. As a result, the issues that matter to the people go unsolved.Because control of the Senate could come down to the Kentucky race, the national news media will be watching; it's the perfect opportunity to steer the conversation away from the usual partisan grandstanding, and change the conversation to money's stranglehold on American governance — and how to fix it.Kentucky isn’t an isolated case. The cost of running for office has exploded in recent years, pushing politicians in both parties to spend more time raising money from special interests and lobbyists, and less time working for the people they’re supposed to represent. The plan We're going to use Gil's presence in the Kentucky race as a launchpad into a major national campaign. He'll crash campaign events, run “honest political ads” on TV and the radio, and do whatever it takes to get the whole country talking about money in politics corruption. We’re renting a campaign bus, slapping Gil’s beautiful face on it, and hitting the campaign trail to bring some much-needed honesty to one of the most expensive Senate campaigns in American history. What will this actually accomplish? It's time to stop doing business as usual, change the national conversation and start demanding new laws to defend the people's government from Big Money corruption. Americans pay the price for our corrupt political system every day. From the economy to the environment, taxes to government waste, it's the root cause of nearly every major problem we face. Yet the press continues to treat the problem as a fringe, “wonky” issue. Gil's campaign is designed to help change that.Satire has worked before, and it can work again. A recent study found that Comedy Central’s Colbert Report has done more to raise the profile of money’s corrupting influence than any other ""news"" source. A well-executed satirical campaign can generate unprecedented national attention for one of the most important issues of our time, and educate millions of Americans about the corruption that’s paralyzing our political system.We will also drive hundreds of thousands to join the growing movement to pass tough new anti-corruption laws and get our country back on track. Our non-partisan, non-profit campaign, Represent.Us, is already more than 450,000 people strong and has reached over 6 million Americans.

<p>The bar is only 12 inches long at its

Baseball is recognized by
Americans as a beloved national pastime, but many don't realize that Nicaragua
shares this passion equally. Unlike most
American children, Nicaraguan youths have significantly less access to baseball
equipment, especially gloves, and often play barehanded or use shared, ""community"" gloves. A baseball glove can be a real luxury in a rural
community!<br/><br/>
In 2012, Gloves Go Far
brought a modest number of used baseball gloves to San Juan del Sur, a small city in
southwest Nicaragua. They were warmly accepted and
appreciated in a way that we cannot readily appreciate. A glove that might be
considered old and worn here would be seen as a welcomed gift in
Nicaragua! <br/><br/>Gloves Go Far founder, Bill Trabilcy, is joining forces with local initiatives to help Nicaraguan youths enjoy our shared national pastime by annually collecting and distributing as many gloves as possible. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">The Newton-San Juan del Sur Sister City project, <a href=""http://sanjuandelsursistercityproject.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://sanjuandelsursistercityproject.wordpress...</a> , is the collaborative team that helps us ensure that the gloves you donate end up in the right hands. They have been doing superb work in Nicaragua since 1994, including the introduction of low tech household water filters, low smoke home cook-stoves, and most of all, the creation of an unprecedented adult school for high school drop outs.  </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">With such </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">strong connections with the local community in San Juan del Sur, you can be certain your donations are going directly to the children in need, and the best news?  Bill goes to Nicaragua himself to see the project through to the end.  You can check out Bill's unique story, and his past travels to Nicaragua, at our blog: </span><a href=""http://glovesgofar.blogspot.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">http://glovesgofar.blogspot.com</a><p></p><div><div>

<h3>What We Need...</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Gloves Go Far would like to ask YOU to donate to our cause.  Since many folks don't have a glove, but they want to help, we are inviting you to donate to our cause here.  ALL proceeds will go to purchasing used gloves, or be put toward luggage and shipping costs. (New gloves unfortunately would make GGF an importer or merchant, and can complicate things).  Donate what you can - every little bit helps.  And THANK YOU from Gloves Go Far.<br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">A lot of 4-8 baseball gloves on eBay can run around $50.00.  This roughly  works out to costing GGF around $10.00 per glove.  This method is significantly cheaper than purchasing new, and the gloves are still in very good condition.  Especially to a child that typically plays bare-handed.</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact...</h3>
<p>Americans and Nicaraguans share this national pastime!  In this small way, we can come together.  Many Nicaraguans in rural areas have poor living conditions with limited healthcare and educational opportunities, and working with the Sister City Projects has made a big difference there.  But Gloves Go Far believes that children still deserve a chance to just play.  What is a small expense for us would mean the world to them - or, at least a day of being a World Series Champion!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help...</h3>
<p>If you are unable to donate money - that's okay!  Gloves Go Far actually wants people to SEND us their used gloves.  The address is on our Facebook page.  You can also help by ""liking"" our Facebook, following our blog, pledging to our Facebook Cause, and sharing this with your friends.  That's not enough?  You can start your own ""GGF Glove Drive"" in your community.  Simply collect as many new and used gloves as you can and send them to GGF.  We will even help with the shipping if necessary.</p>

A lot of 4-8 baseball gloves on eBay can run around $50.00.  This roughly  works out to costing GGF around $10.00 per glove.  This method is significantly cheaper than purchasing new, and the gloves are still in very good condition.  Especially to a child that typically plays bare-handed.


The Impact...
Americans and Nicaraguans share this national pastime!  In this small way, we can come together.  Many Nicaraguans in rural areas have poor living conditions with limited healthcare and educational opportunities, and working with the Sister City Projects has made a big difference there.  But Gloves Go Far believes that children still deserve a chance to just play.  What is a small expense for us would mean the world to them - or, at least a day of being a World Series Champion!


Other Ways You Can Help...
If you are unable to donate money - that's okay!  Gloves Go Far actually wants people to SEND us their used gloves.  The address is on our Facebook page.  You can also help by ""liking"" our Facebook, following our blog, pledging to our Facebook Cause, and sharing this with your friends.  That's not enough?  You can start your own ""GGF Glove Drive"" in your community.  Simply collect as many new and used gloves as you can and send them to GGF.  We will even help with the shipping if necessary.

</div><p><span>“Physicians advocating to eliminate the damaging health consequences that can result from negative interactions with the criminal justice system”</span></p><p>Thank you for your interest! We are raising money to create a professional, permanent internet home for our new organization: Physicians for Criminal Justice Reform. These funds will also help us to establish PfCJR as a 501c3 non-profit organization. Whatever you can give would be greatly appreciated!</p><p>ABOUT US</p><p>Physicians for Criminal Justice Reform (PfCJR) was founded by a group of physicians who were struck by the myriad of ways that negative encounters with the criminal justice system lead to detrimental health consequences. We firmly believe that changing the interaction between the criminal justice system and individuals of targeted populations will ultimately lead to improved health of targeted communities.  As such, our members have made the commitment to be leaders of criminal justice reform by using our medical expertise to:</p><ul>
<li><p>Increase awareness and knowledge of the bidirectional relationship between health and the criminal justice system</p></li>
<li><p>Serve as a fund of knowledge, education and training for local, state and national health and justice systems</p></li>
<li><p>Lobby for criminal justice reform surrounding our core issues</p></li>
</ul><br/><br/><br/><p>CORE ISSUES</p><p>Physicians for Criminal Justice Reform seeks to support the creation of a humane, egalitarian justice system by advocating for the following reforms.</p><br/><p>Decriminalization of mental health and addictive disorders</p><ul>
<li><p>Across the nation, individuals with severe mental illness are three times more likely to be in a jail or prison than in a mental health facility and<a href=""http://www.treatmentadvocacycenter.org/resources/consequences-of-lack-of-treatment/jaiI/1371"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> 40 percent</a> of individuals with a severe mental illness will have spent some time in their lives in either jail, prison, or community corrections.  </p></li>
<li><p>It has been shown that about 20 percent of prison inmates have a serious mental illness, 30 to 60 percent have substance abuse problems and, when including broad-based mental illnesses, the percentages increase significantly.</p></li>
<li><p>An estimated 50 percent of males and 75 percent of female inmates in state prisons, and 75 percent of females and 63 percent of male inmates in jails, will experience a mental health problem requiring mental health services in any given year.</p></li>
<li><p>Despite 45 million drug related arrests in the U.S., rates of addiction remain unchanged and overdose deaths are at an all-time high.</p></li>
</ul><br/><p>Reform of the juvenile justice system to identify and divert at risk adolescents.</p><ul>
<li><p>On any given night in America, 10,000 children are held in adult jails and prisons.</p></li>
<li><p>As many as 70 percent of youth in the juvenile justice system have a diagnosable mental health disorder.</p></li>
<li><p>Youth housed in adult jails are 36 times more likely to commit suicide than are youth housed in juvenile detention facilities.</p></li>
<li><p>According to research by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, youth under the age of 18 represented 21 percent of all substantiated victims of inmate-on-inmate sexual violence in jails in 2005, and 13 percent in 2006 – surprisingly high since only one percent of jail inmates are juveniles.</p></li>

We are raising money to create a professional, permanent internet home for our new organization: Physicians for Criminal Justice Reform. These funds will also help us to establish PfCJR as a 501c3 non-profit organization. Whatever you can give would be greatly appreciated!ABOUT USPhysicians for Criminal Justice Reform (PfCJR) was founded by a group of physicians who were struck by the myriad of ways that negative encounters with the criminal justice system lead to detrimental health consequences. We firmly believe that changing the interaction between the criminal justice system and individuals of targeted populations will ultimately lead to improved health of targeted communities.  As such, our members have made the commitment to be leaders of criminal justice reform by using our medical expertise to:
Increase awareness and knowledge of the bidirectional relationship between health and the criminal justice system
Serve as a fund of knowledge, education and training for local, state and national health and justice systems
Lobby for criminal justice reform surrounding our core issues
CORE ISSUESPhysicians for Criminal Justice Reform seeks to support the creation of a humane, egalitarian justice system by advocating for the following reforms.Decriminalization of mental health and addictive disorders
Across the nation, individuals with severe mental illness are three times more likely to be in a jail or prison than in a mental health facility and 40 percent of individuals with a severe mental illness will have spent some time in their lives in either jail, prison, or community corrections.  
It has been shown that about 20 percent of prison inmates have a serious mental illness, 30 to 60 percent have substance abuse problems and, when including broad-based mental illnesses, the percentages increase significantly.
An estimated 50 percent of males and 75 percent of female inmates in state prisons, and 75 percent of females and 63 percent of male inmates in jails, will experience a mental health problem requiring mental health services in any given year.
Despite 45 million drug related arrests in the U.S., rates of addiction remain unchanged and overdose deaths are at an all-time high.
Reform of the juvenile justice system to identify and divert at risk adolescents.
On any given night in America, 10,000 children are held in adult jails and prisons.
As many as 70 percent of youth in the juvenile justice system have a diagnosable mental health disorder.
Youth housed in adult jails are 36 times more likely to commit suicide than are youth housed in juvenile detention facilities.
According to research by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, youth under the age of 18 represented 21 percent of all substantiated victims of inmate-on-inmate sexual violence in jails in 2005, and 13 percent in 2006 – surprisingly high since only one percent of jail inmates are juveniles.
Provision of adequate access to physical and psychiatric health care for current inmates.
Medical experts say inmates typically experience the effects of age sooner than do people outside prison because of issues such as substance use disorders, inadequate preventive and primary care before incarceration, and stress linked to the isolation and sometimes-violent environment of prison.
Prison inmates have a higher incidence of chronic and infectious diseases, such as AIDS and hepatitis C, and mental illness than that of the general population.
The United States continues to have one of the highest incarceration rates in the world, with 5 percent of the world population, but nearly 25 percent of the world’s prisoners.
By ending mass incarceration, correctional physician resources will be better matched to demand and fewer individuals with be exposed to the stressors of incarceration that lead to higher rates of chronic illness
About 66% of prisoners and 40% of jail inmates with a chronic condition at the time of interview reported taking prescription medication.
STRATEGIESPhysicians for Criminal Justice Reform seeks to support the creation of a humane, egalitarian justice system by using the following strategies.Research Promotion
PfCJR will increase awareness of the bidirectional relationship between health and the criminal justice system for targeted populations by centralizing health-related criminal justice data from various private, public, governmental and non-governmental organizations.
PfCJR will serve as a fund of knowledge, education and training for local, state and national health and justice systems by providing white papers, webinars, keynote speakers, panelists and consulting services to individuals and organizations who have the capacity to drive criminal justice reform.
Education and Awareness
PfCJR will maintain a social media and internet presence to increase awareness and knowledge of the bidirectional relationship between health and the criminal justice system using our own original content and content from key partners.
PfCJR will circulate petitions to our members and issue press releases to major news outlets to familiarize the public with our core issues.
PfCJR member physicians will be made available to media outlets to discuss the medical impact of the criminal justice system on targeted communities when key events are being discussed in the media.
Political Advocacy
PfCJR will lobby for criminal justice reform surrounding our core issues by partnering with existing lobbying organizations to ensure the health-related consequences of our current criminal justice system remains a primary motivator for reform.
PfCJR will create opportunities for collaborative problem-solving by providing current data directly to local, state and federal legislators.
Partnering with Like-Minded Organizations
PfCJR will partner with like-minded organizations to leverage multidisciplinary expertise in an effort to drive coordinated, cross-systemic change.

<h3>Jeanne Calment, at 122 years and 116 days</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571373952/e6swnpux8b9ho1llupsz.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>has set a pretty high benchmark for longevity. She attributed her resilience to olive oil and a daily exercise routine.  As the oldest recorded living person, we are happy to make her the patron saint of Game Of Life.</p>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>The mission of Game Of Life is to help you to extend your life to its maximum and to reduce the risks of disease.  We are unique in that we have a compassionate empathy bot (Golly) that uses neural network methodologies to learn about you and propose the ways in which you can reach your stated goals.</p>
<p>Research suggests that compassion is the most effective way to get results, but don't be fooled, as a personal trainer, he will be resolute in guiding you.</p>
<h3>Meet GOLLY</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571375059/oex1gi4qxg7ttab39gkr.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Tell GOLLY your age, gender, weight and height and GOLLY will tell you how long the average person of your gender, age, weight and height, can expect to live.   When you give Golly more information about your aerobic fitness, or strength or endurance, Golly will be able to estimate your probable lifespan. But that is only where it starts. You can set a goal and a date and Golly will plot and monitor the most effective multifactorial strategy for you to achieve that goal in the allotted time.</p>
<p><strong>So in exchange for 5 minutes of your time, let us try to convince you that we can deliver information and a process that will indeed extend your life and reduce the risk of disease. </strong></p>
<p><strong>5 minutes for a decade or more of vibrant good health.  do we have a deal?</strong></p>
<h2>How you can help</h2>
<p>I have found a new purpose in life. If GOL can help people increase the prospect of a longer vibrant life then it will be doing good. </p>
<p><strong>As we are appealing to baby boomers +-10 years, the number of people it can help is practically limitless</strong>. <strong>Think of the pain and suffering that can be avoided if many people start living a lifestyle that minimises the risk of disease</strong>. </p>
</div><div>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get:</h2>
<h3>Funding</h3>
<p>This started as a personal goal to do what was necessary to remain a player in the Game Of Life as long as possible.  It gave me a new zest and a desire to share what I was learning.<br/>Having been a serial entrepreneur in the IT industry. I naturally thought about packaging what I was learning in an App so the curated knowledge could be shared. </p>
<p>But to do this I needed to hire the right technical people.</p>
<p>I have been very lucky to have found a team that has successfully brought a nutrition App to market.  But GOL is much more than a nutrition App. </p>
<p>I also stumbled on a senior Apple software developer who is doing research into AI.</p>
<p>And thus was GOLLY born.  GOLLY (Game Of Long Life for You) uses neural network methodologies to learn from the data it receives about someone so that he can direct the activities of that person towards the achievement of the goals that person has specified.</p>
<p>But if GOLLY is going effective he will need to be imbued with compassionate empathy,</p>
<p><strong>My enthusiasm comes at significant financial cost.</strong> </p>
<p>Game Of Life has been a year in the making and we are nearly there. Unfortunately, the year has depleted my financial resources. I need an injection of cash to keep the target delivery date on track.</p>
<p>The Body module should be ready for beta testing in December and the Brain module next January.</p>

<p>If you already have a smartwatch please give it to someone else who could benefit. </p>
<h2>Longevity Calculators</h2>
<p>We have developed some unique proprietary fitness calculators.</p>
<p>There are three widely researched tests with reference data that can be used to approximate one's physical fitness, maximal aerobic capacity and strength level.</p>
<p>We are selling them as stand-alone products but as they are part of the future App we will send them to you now.</p>
<p><b>We have five calculators based on peer-researched algorithms which assess biological age from different perspectives. They assess aerobic fitness, strength, metabolic health, psychological wellness and deficit accumulation. The combination of these assessments will give a fairly accurate estimate of your current biological age and the probable years to live.  ""Know Thyself"" so you can plan your road to a younger and healthier self.</b></p>

<p>You will be able to approximate your biological age with these simple tests.</p>
<p>The 6MWT only requires a flat surface of 12M or more. Measure a distance and place cones then walk for 6 minutes and record distance. </p>
<p>The 6MWT assesses the distance walked in 6 minutes as a submaximal test of aerobic capacity and endurance.</p>
<p><a href=""https://erj.ersjournals.com/content/37/1/150"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Reference standards</a> have been gathered from seven countries. The most important factor influencing the 6MWD in healthy subjects was age. Also, the 6MWD is greater in males than females.</p>
<p>The calculator will inform you of the percentile band you fall in for people of similar age, gender, weight, and height. You will also see the age at which you would have fallen into the 50th percentile.</p>
<p>The goal is to grow younger physiologically. So, put down a goal date and distance and then from time to time retest yourself to see how you are going.</p>

<h2>FI34 (Frailty Index 34)</h2>
<p>The frailty index outperforms DNA methylation age and its derivatives as an indicator of biological age</p>
<p>The measurement of biological age, as opposed to chronological age, is important to allow the study of factors that are responsible for the heterogeneity in the decline in health and function ability among individuals during aging. Various measures of biological aging have been proposed. Frailty indices based on health deficits in diverse body systems have been well studied, and we have documented the use of a frailty index (FI34) composed of 34 health items, for measuring biological age. </p>
<p>Any useful measure of biological age must predict survival better than chronological age does. Meta-analyses indicate that age acceleration difference and age acceleration residual are significant predictors of mortality, qualifying them as indicators of biological age.</p>
<p>In the presence of chronological age as a covariate, FI34 was a significant predictor of mortality, whereas none of the DNA methylation age-based metrics was. The outperformance of FI34 over DNA methylation age measures was apparent when FI34 and each of the DNA methylation age measures was used together as explanatory variables, along with chronological age: FI34 remained significant but the DNA methylation measures did not. These results indicate that FI34 is a robust predictor of biological age, while these DNA methylation measures are largely a statistical reflection of the passage of chronological time.</p>
<p>The term biological aging has been developed to conceptualize the fact that individuals differ in their manifestation of age changes as they age chronologically.</p>
<p>FI34 increases exponentially with age, indicating declining health and function ability. The rate of increase accelerates approximately 2~3 % annually.</p>
<p>A survival analysis indicates that FI34 predicts mortality better than does chronological age.</p>
<p>The fact that FI34 predicts mortality/survival better than does the simple passage of time indicates that it is more than a naive chronometer. Rather, it is a metric of biological age.</p>

<h2>Ryff Psychological Wellness</h2>
<p>One of the most widely used survey instruments is Ryff’s multi-dimensional Psychological Well-being scales (PWB). It was specifically defined to measure positive aspects of psychological functioning along six theoretically-motivated dimensions: independence and self-determination (autonomy); having satisfying, high quality relationships (positive relations with others); the ability to manage one’s life (environmental mastery); being open to new experiences (personal growth); believing that one’s life is meaningful (purpose in life); and a positive attitude towards oneself and one’s past life (self-acceptance).</p>

</div></div>","Jeanne Calment, at 122 years and 116 days

has set a pretty high benchmark for longevity. She attributed her resilience to olive oil and a daily exercise routine.  As the oldest recorded living person, we are happy to make her the patron saint of Game Of Life.
Mission
The mission of Game Of Life is to help you to extend your life to its maximum and to reduce the risks of disease.  We are unique in that we have a compassionate empathy bot (Golly) that uses neural network methodologies to learn about you and propose the ways in which you can reach your stated goals.
Research suggests that compassion is the most effective way to get results, but don't be fooled, as a personal trainer, he will be resolute in guiding you.
Meet GOLLY

Tell GOLLY your age, gender, weight and height and GOLLY will tell you how long the average person of your gender, age, weight and height, can expect to live.   When you give Golly more information about your aerobic fitness, or strength or endurance, Golly will be able to estimate your probable lifespan. But that is only where it starts. You can set a goal and a date and Golly will plot and monitor the most effective multifactorial strategy for you to achieve that goal in the allotted time.
So in exchange for 5 minutes of your time, let us try to convince you that we can deliver information and a process that will indeed extend your life and reduce the risk of disease. 
5 minutes for a decade or more of vibrant good health.  do we have a deal?
How you can help
I have found a new purpose in life. If GOL can help people increase the prospect of a longer vibrant life then it will be doing good. 
As we are appealing to baby boomers +-10 years, the number of people it can help is practically limitless. Think of the pain and suffering that can be avoided if many people start living a lifestyle that minimises the risk of disease. 

What We Need & What You Get:
Funding
This started as a personal goal to do what was necessary to remain a player in the Game Of Life as long as possible.  It gave me a new zest and a desire to share what I was learning.Having been a serial entrepreneur in the IT industry. I naturally thought about packaging what I was learning in an App so the curated knowledge could be shared. 
But to do this I needed to hire the right technical people.
I have been very lucky to have found a team that has successfully brought a nutrition App to market.  But GOL is much more than a nutrition App. 
I also stumbled on a senior Apple software developer who is doing research into AI.
And thus was GOLLY born.  GOLLY (Game Of Long Life for You) uses neural network methodologies to learn from the data it receives about someone so that he can direct the activities of that person towards the achievement of the goals that person has specified.
But if GOLLY is going effective he will need to be imbued with compassionate empathy,
My enthusiasm comes at significant financial cost. 
Game Of Life has been a year in the making and we are nearly there. Unfortunately, the year has depleted my financial resources. I need an injection of cash to keep the target delivery date on track.
The Body module should be ready for beta testing in December and the Brain module next January.

Game Of Life
Is an Android and iOS App and a Wordpress blog designed to guide and motivate members to take the actions necessary to extend life and reduce the risk of disease. The Body module
The Body Module gives you the tools to eat the right nutrient-dense foods in the right quantities, It encourages you to move in the most efficient manner to meet your health needs goals. It will monitor your fibre and probiotic intake so your gut supports your health.
The Food Dairy

The food column includes previously analysed recipes.
On the right, the nutrient wheel shows the proportions of fats, proteins, carbohydrates, fibre and calories/kilojoules.
The nutrient shortfall accumulates and highlights the deficiencies of the nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and amino acids for the week. 
Click on GOLLY to see which foods have the highest concentrations of the deficient nutrients.
You are invited to contribute your favourite recipe, whether its Grandma’s secret or the best Keto imaginable. The recipes are analysed for nutrients and saved in a format that will enable the publishing of a book. The contributor of the best recipe each week earns an award that can be redeemed in our health goods related shop.
The Brain Module
 
The Brain Module helps you sleep adequately. It engineers social inclusion through a buddy system. It asks you to set and it helps you meet, goals that give your life meaning. It gives you the tools to understand your psychological profile. Mindfulness, meditation, relaxation and just chilling all prolong life. We provide the resources you will need.
Laughter is not only the best medicine, it helps us live longer. Enjoy our daily joke. Contribute the bedtime story that enraptured your kids or grandkids. Give us your favourite recipe.  We will publish and donatee the proceeds to www.feedthechildren.org. The Wordpress Blog www.gameof.life

harvests and presents peer-reviewed scientific papers on the factors affecting morbidity, including nutrition, exercise, microbiome, sleep, meditation, brain entrainment, sense of purpose, social inclusion, and humour.
It is through our brain that we experience who we are. Our task is to provide our brains with the best environment for it to function.
Knowledge is power so we kick off with the Ryff scale of Psychological wellbeing delivered over 6 weeks with an assessment each week of one of the six categories.
Poor sleep hygiene is associated with increased mortality.  We have proprietary music visualisation software that entrains the brain to a soporific state through binaural mimicry. 
Our market is primarily Baby Boomers and many of you have wonderful bedtime stories that calmed your children and grandchildren. Submit them so we can share them and publish them.
Meditators live longer, have less stress and disease than the average population.  
Kirtan Kyria protects against Alzheimer's. Vipassana builds neurons. Yoga, rest, relaxation, Pilates all confer benefits.  We have tutorials on each of these.
The key to success is to develop a sense of purpose. Tell us about it and let GOLLY provide curated and psychologically appropriate coaching and motivation.

So, apart from AI Coaching, what do you get with Game of Life?
How we can express our gratitude for your contribution
We need 300 contributors at $100AUD each to cover the next few months commitments.
There must be many thousands of Indegogo viewers who would like to live longer and healthier. GOL will help them do that in some unique ways.
- As beta testers, you will have access to the App for 12 months after its launch.
- Your $100 commitment represents around 40% of what the initial subscribers will be paying.
GOL accesses data from wearable devices. You will need a smartwatch.
You can obtain this from our gameof.life  WordPress shop .

 
If you already have a smartwatch please give it to someone else who could benefit. 
Longevity Calculators
We have developed some unique proprietary fitness calculators.
There are three widely researched tests with reference data that can be used to approximate one's physical fitness, maximal aerobic capacity and strength level.
We are selling them as stand-alone products but as they are part of the future App we will send them to you now.
We have five calculators based on peer-researched algorithms which assess biological age from different perspectives. They assess aerobic fitness, strength, metabolic health, psychological wellness and deficit accumulation. The combination of these assessments will give a fairly accurate estimate of your current biological age and the probable years to live.  ""Know Thyself"" so you can plan your road to a younger and healthier self.
6MWT
 

You will be able to approximate your biological age with these simple tests.
The 6MWT only requires a flat surface of 12M or more. Measure a distance and place cones then walk for 6 minutes and record distance. 
The 6MWT assesses the distance walked in 6 minutes as a submaximal test of aerobic capacity and endurance.
Reference standards have been gathered from seven countries. The most important factor influencing the 6MWD in healthy subjects was age. Also, the 6MWD is greater in males than females.
The calculator will inform you of the percentile band you fall in for people of similar age, gender, weight, and height. You will also see the age at which you would have fallen into the 50th percentile.
The goal is to grow younger physiologically. So, put down a goal date and distance and then from time to time retest yourself to see how you are going.
 
Grip Strength
Grip Strength is a measure of overall muscular strength and has been associated with disability, morbidity and mortality. In a large 11000+ person study, it was concluded that reference values for grip strength increased through childhood and adolescence, peaked around age 40, and then declined. Reference values were higher for males than for females.
Our calculator uses the algorithms developed in that study. 
 

If you don't have access to a handgrip dynamometer you can get one from our shop

VO2max
The risk of dying from cardiovascular disease is  21 % lower for each increase of 3.5 mL/kg/min, or 1 MET. 
This association persists after adjusting the analysis for confounding factors. The risk of dying from all causes during follow-up is gradually reduced with better fitness.
The Fitness Calculator estimates your fitness age measured as maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max). 
 Traditionally this test requires a mask connected to a machine that measures the composition of the subject's breath during graded exercise taken to exhaustion.
Results derived this way will be more accurate than the 6MWT approximation. But the difference in accuracy is not significant.

<h2><strong>Our Modern Lives™: 21<sup>st</sup> Century Fragrances for Body &amp; Space</strong></h2>
<p>We’re 4160Tuesdays. We make fragrances in London, one of the busiest, stimulating, fascinating cities in the world. Sarah McCartney, our founder and perfumer, also teaches yoga; sometimes you just need an escape from all that action. With the pressure and excitement of running a business, she needs a balance, an escape from the blue screens and wifi that dominate our lives.</p>
<p>Five years ago Sarah made five yoga room fragrances for her own use; Our Modern Lives has developed from that project.</p>
<p>Every week we’re asked for two things: 100% natural fragrances, and safe scents with no allergens. People often imagine they can have both in the same bottle, or that one implies that you get the other. It’s not that simple.</p>
<p>The issue is that nature is naughty – there are allergens in most essential oils, including jasmine, rose, lavender, all citrus fruits and the spices - which means that natural fragrance has to be handled really carefully to be safe, to be legal and still to smell great.</p>
<p>Recently we’ve had more requests from people who’ve found they are allergic to the naturals oils in orange peel, which you’ll find in many fragrances, or to ylang ylang, cinnamon or geranium essential oils.</p>
<p>With seven years’ experience of making fragrances to both the International Fragrance Association standards on personal and environmental safety and the strict EU cosmetics regulations, we’re in a good place to launch our new venture, listening to what our customers asked for, and being open about what we use to make them.</p>
<p>So we’ve created fragrances that give you a choice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seven 100% natural fragrances. We’re using all our experience to make these complex blends beautiful and safe.</li>
<li>Two 100% synthetic fragrances which have no allergens. Here we’re choosing simple blends of molecular compounds to create soft, smooth, long-lasting sensual fragrances.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve sourced organic grain alcohol (denatured so you can’t drink it), essential oils, plant absolutes and natural isolates (individual fragrance compounds from plant sources) to create fragrances for everyone who wants this option.</p>
<p>We’re using totally benign, clean single aroma molecules made synthetically to create a fragrance which you could safely use undiluted on your skin. (Just to compare, we’ve been tweaking our powerful natural blends for several months to make them legal at 10% dilution – that’s how tricky it is to work with nature.)</p>
<p>You can choose just the naturals, just the synthetics or combine both. Use them together and your fragrances will smell smoother and last longer, but it’s up to you. We’re making them as roll-ons to keep your scent in your own space, and as body &amp; room sprays to change the atmosphere around you.</p>
<p>Sarah’s yoga students have been appreciating them for a few years now. We hope you’d like to share them too.</p>
<h3><strong>We're offering you the fragrances at early bird prices</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>We’ve set the target at £4000 to be able to order natural materials from top quality suppliers. There are three companies we’d like to buy from, and each one has a minimum order value.</li>
<li>The fragrances: after seven years making fragrances we are happiest making scents at a ratio of about 40:60 naturals to synthetics. Using synthetics is a bit like adding sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride to your cupcakes – that’s baking powder and a pinch of salt – it might sound scary but it makes for a better result.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scent is for everyone</strong></p>
<ul><li>We completely get that many people want just the naturals. We also get that one in 1000 people is allergic to something in perfume (often things that occur naturally in essential oils) so they need a fragrance that’s totally benign. For a long lasting fragrance,  you can that you wear the naturals on top of the synthetics, but if you want or need to, you can keep them separate.</li></ul>
<h3>The Synthetics</h3>
<ul>
<li>OML α – a soft, mildly ambery woodsy fragrance that really lasts well, made with seven synthetic materials, completely clear in colour. Some of the beautiful aroma molecules we use here are more expensive than most naturals.</li>
<li>OML β – even softer and smoother and very long lasting. We chose to make OML β with materials which are widely used in perfumery, including costly niche fragrances, but they are out of patent so their prices have fallen. We wanted to make a really good, affordable fragrance, so here you are.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Naturals: seven shades, moods and atmospheres.</h3>
<p>We are going to keep a few of the natural ingredients secret, but here are most of those that we’ve included. We have not economised on the materials, but as we’re making them all here in our studio, and sending them to you directly, the prices are really well discounted. Expect them to at least twice the price.</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Red – Harvest – Gratitude: A sense of security</strong>, nature’s bounty, reaping what we sow. For us it feels like a rich red berry in colour. Materials include: hay absolute, Turkish rose absolute, raspberry leaf absolute, oakwood CO2 extract, hazelnut CO2 extract, labdanum, wine essential oil, davana essential oil, pink peppercorn C)2 absolute.</li>
<li>
<strong>Orange – Sunset – Peace: A sense of serenity</strong> as the sun goes down, lighting up the sky in shades of blood orange, Materials include: neroli essential oil, Honeybush CO2 extract, vanilla absolute, cocoa absolute, peach natural liquid, bran absolute, rose geranium essential oil, Virginian cedarwood essential oil.</li>
<li>
<strong>Yellow – Sunrise – Hope: A sense of vitality</strong>, but because it’s early we’ve added in a dash of coffee for a touch of real life. Materials include: lemon petitgrain, fennel, cardamon, clementine, yellow mandarin, blood orange and sweet orange essential oils, coffee absolute, narcissus absolute and cabreuva essential oil.</li>
<li>
<strong>Green – Leaf – New: A sense of revival. </strong>The smell of spring when green shoots appear from the cold and dark. Materials include: jasmine tea CO2 extract, green mandarin essential oil, Calabrian bergamot essential oil, cucumber natural liquid, bergamot mint essential oil and spinach absolute.</li>
<li>
<strong>Aquamarine – Waves/WiFi – Clarity: A sense of connection. </strong>The colour of the clear warm sea, and sharp hit of citrus and deep seaweed. Materials include: white grapefruit and rosemary essential oils, olive fruit CO2 extract, jasmine sambac absolute, blue hemlock essential oil, organic English lavender essential oil, seaweed absolute.</li>
<li>
<strong>Blue Screen/Blue Horizon – Perspective : A sense of balance.</strong> We spend too much time looking at screens, not enough at the horizon. This is a scent to help you meditate.

</div></div>","Our Modern Lives™: 21st Century Fragrances for Body & Space
We’re 4160Tuesdays. We make fragrances in London, one of the busiest, stimulating, fascinating cities in the world. Sarah McCartney, our founder and perfumer, also teaches yoga; sometimes you just need an escape from all that action. With the pressure and excitement of running a business, she needs a balance, an escape from the blue screens and wifi that dominate our lives.
Five years ago Sarah made five yoga room fragrances for her own use; Our Modern Lives has developed from that project.
Every week we’re asked for two things: 100% natural fragrances, and safe scents with no allergens. People often imagine they can have both in the same bottle, or that one implies that you get the other. It’s not that simple.
The issue is that nature is naughty – there are allergens in most essential oils, including jasmine, rose, lavender, all citrus fruits and the spices - which means that natural fragrance has to be handled really carefully to be safe, to be legal and still to smell great.
Recently we’ve had more requests from people who’ve found they are allergic to the naturals oils in orange peel, which you’ll find in many fragrances, or to ylang ylang, cinnamon or geranium essential oils.
With seven years’ experience of making fragrances to both the International Fragrance Association standards on personal and environmental safety and the strict EU cosmetics regulations, we’re in a good place to launch our new venture, listening to what our customers asked for, and being open about what we use to make them.
So we’ve created fragrances that give you a choice:

Seven 100% natural fragrances. We’re using all our experience to make these complex blends beautiful and safe.
Two 100% synthetic fragrances which have no allergens. Here we’re choosing simple blends of molecular compounds to create soft, smooth, long-lasting sensual fragrances.

We’ve sourced organic grain alcohol (denatured so you can’t drink it), essential oils, plant absolutes and natural isolates (individual fragrance compounds from plant sources) to create fragrances for everyone who wants this option.
We’re using totally benign, clean single aroma molecules made synthetically to create a fragrance which you could safely use undiluted on your skin. (Just to compare, we’ve been tweaking our powerful natural blends for several months to make them legal at 10% dilution – that’s how tricky it is to work with nature.)
You can choose just the naturals, just the synthetics or combine both. Use them together and your fragrances will smell smoother and last longer, but it’s up to you. We’re making them as roll-ons to keep your scent in your own space, and as body & room sprays to change the atmosphere around you.
Sarah’s yoga students have been appreciating them for a few years now. We hope you’d like to share them too.
We're offering you the fragrances at early bird prices

We’ve set the target at £4000 to be able to order natural materials from top quality suppliers. There are three companies we’d like to buy from, and each one has a minimum order value.
The fragrances: after seven years making fragrances we are happiest making scents at a ratio of about 40:60 naturals to synthetics. Using synthetics is a bit like adding sodium bicarbonate and sodium chloride to your cupcakes – that’s baking powder and a pinch of salt – it might sound scary but it makes for a better result.

Scent is for everyone
We completely get that many people want just the naturals. We also get that one in 1000 people is allergic to something in perfume (often things that occur naturally in essential oils) so they need a fragrance that’s totally benign. For a long lasting fragrance,  you can that you wear the naturals on top of the synthetics, but if you want or need to, you can keep them separate.
The Synthetics

OML α – a soft, mildly ambery woodsy fragrance that really lasts well, made with seven synthetic materials, completely clear in colour. Some of the beautiful aroma molecules we use here are more expensive than most naturals.
OML β – even softer and smoother and very long lasting. We chose to make OML β with materials which are widely used in perfumery, including costly niche fragrances, but they are out of patent so their prices have fallen. We wanted to make a really good, affordable fragrance, so here you are.

The Naturals: seven shades, moods and atmospheres.
We are going to keep a few of the natural ingredients secret, but here are most of those that we’ve included. We have not economised on the materials, but as we’re making them all here in our studio, and sending them to you directly, the prices are really well discounted. Expect them to at least twice the price.
 


Red – Harvest – Gratitude: A sense of security, nature’s bounty, reaping what we sow. For us it feels like a rich red berry in colour. Materials include: hay absolute, Turkish rose absolute, raspberry leaf absolute, oakwood CO2 extract, hazelnut CO2 extract, labdanum, wine essential oil, davana essential oil, pink peppercorn C)2 absolute.

Orange – Sunset – Peace: A sense of serenity as the sun goes down, lighting up the sky in shades of blood orange, Materials include: neroli essential oil, Honeybush CO2 extract, vanilla absolute, cocoa absolute, peach natural liquid, bran absolute, rose geranium essential oil, Virginian cedarwood essential oil.

Yellow – Sunrise – Hope: A sense of vitality, but because it’s early we’ve added in a dash of coffee for a touch of real life. Materials include: lemon petitgrain, fennel, cardamon, clementine, yellow mandarin, blood orange and sweet orange essential oils, coffee absolute, narcissus absolute and cabreuva essential oil.

Green – Leaf – New: A sense of revival. The smell of spring when green shoots appear from the cold and dark. Materials include: jasmine tea CO2 extract, green mandarin essential oil, Calabrian bergamot essential oil, cucumber natural liquid, bergamot mint essential oil and spinach absolute.

Aquamarine – Waves/WiFi – Clarity: A sense of connection. The colour of the clear warm sea, and sharp hit of citrus and deep seaweed. Materials include: white grapefruit and rosemary essential oils, olive fruit CO2 extract, jasmine sambac absolute, blue hemlock essential oil, organic English lavender essential oil, seaweed absolute.

Blue Screen/Blue Horizon – Perspective : A sense of balance. We spend too much time looking at screens, not enough at the horizon. This is a scent to help you meditate. Materials include frankincense essential oil, lavender absolute, vetivert absolute, eucalyptus mint essential oil, patchouli essential oil, hyacinth absolute, organic English lavender essential oil.

Indigo – Into the Night: A sense of the infinite. A 3a.m. scent of total darkness, when night feels endless. Materials include: Cognac absolute, black tea CO2 extract, osmanthus absolute, Atlas cedarwood essential oil, jasmine sambac absolute, labdanum absolute, rum CO2 extract.

 

Personal fragrances: we’re making 10ml rollerball sizes so you can apply your natural fragrances without filling the air around you, if you prefer that. They are eau de parfum strength.
Body sprays: these are less concentrated fragrances 100ml bottles, and are safe for use on the body, and also for use as a room spray. We had these in mind for yoga teachers who have to go into a studio after a fast paced (sweaty) aerobics class just happened.

Wear them with the naturals to make them last longer, feel smoother and smell more like perfumes usually do. Wear them on their own because they don’t have any allergens at all and because they smell fantastic.

To go ahead, we need materials in bigger quantities

If we can buy by the 100g or the kilo, then we can afford to produce these fragrances affordably. Through crowdfunding we generate enough orders in advance to buy what we need.
Your commitment and our promises

We know that fragrance is a personal thing, and that committing before you buy is a brave step. For that reason we are setting the prices far lower than they will be when we launch officially in September.

World's 1st to record insulin dosages AutomaticallyAs is well known, there is no cure for diabetes at present. There are an estimated 415 million Diabetics around the World and the only way to keep diabetes under control is proper management. Insulin dosages, blood glucose levels, dietary intake, and physical activity can have a great influence on diabetes management.However, our fast-paced lifestyles and various kinds of food constantly tempt us to stray away from healthy diabetes management.

<p>HabiDerm is a platform designed to improve the look, feel and health of your skin by connecting, comforting, informing and inspiring you to achieve short- and long-term goals.</p>
<p>Through two-way text and email communication, HabiDerm learns about you and helps you track the everyday actions that have an impact on your skin’s health, look and feel.  Based on your lifestyle, we curate, relevant information and deliver personalized info “bites” to you so you can make more informed choices.  Did you know: </p>

</ul>
<p>Some are so good and fun you’ll have to tell your friends!</p>
<p>Motivated by my 20+ years in the beauty industry (and my own personal skin struggles as a teen and a 3rd-time mom), I wanted to share my experience, what I learned and demystify the pursuit for perfect skin and reveal the industry’s “biggest” secret – the key to healthy, beautiful, radiant skin. So I joined forces with some of my BFFs including:</p>
<ul>
<li>a friend and colleague with whom I started a skincare and cosmetics company,</li>
<li>a friend who started and owns a technology development company,</li>
<li>a friend who is a strategic interactive marketing and customer retention specialist</li>
<li>and my squad of beauty experts, editors, bloggers, makeup artists and aestheticians  </li>
</ul>
<p>and created HabiDerm – a health and beauty recommendation engine and custom content platform for men and women. Our mission is to inspire and empower individuals to realize their own best-self and achieve their personal beauty, health and wellness goals – <i>without heaps of new products or procedures. </i></p>

<li>Camera fixture is also fast. Adapter has square shape and it is possible change camera's position in horizontal plane at 90° in few seconds.</li>
<li>Extra feature: standalone design.

<li>Well summer is not over, and today (08.29.2014) I'm finding that I may, and I stress may, have to pay a $2,466.94 for a 1 night hospital stay from July.  The Hospital is in my insurrance network, however I need to be pre-approved even for emergencies.  I don't know how my Insurance Company can say that a Hospital is in network but then, it's not at the same time.</li>

<li>I am getting some 'You can do it alone' comments already 'don't expect me to contribute'.  You don't have to contribute anything if you don't want to.  I do have to ask people somehow.  You give only if you want to, not because I ask to spread the word.  </li>
<li>To humble myself in a time of need is no laughing matter (I was literally laughed at by a coworker).  I wish that I would never have to do this.  I was born with this disease, that lead to a Kidney Transplant, and I hope that those who laughed at my face would never have to suffer these problems.</li> </ul><p><br/></p><ul></ul><div>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> I have already done so much to try and save.</p> <ul>
<li>I've taken away all forms of TV access.</li>
<li>I switched my phone to a flip phone to save $20 dollars a month.</li>
<li>My challange is getting through winter.  The heat bills are just going up and up.</li> <li>To face the challange of gas costs, my mother bought me a bicycle.</li>

To humble myself in a time of need is no laughing matter (I was literally laughed at by a coworker).  I wish that I would never have to do this.  I was born with this disease, that lead to a Kidney Transplant, and I hope that those who laughed at my face would never have to suffer these problems. 
  Risks & Challenges  I have already done so much to try and save. 
I've taken away all forms of TV access.
I switched my phone to a flip phone to save $20 dollars a month.
My challange is getting through winter.  The heat bills are just going up and up. To face the challange of gas costs, my mother bought me a bicycle.
And if worse comes to worse I'm just going to have to put the heat on the minimum setting so the pipes don't freeze. 
  Other Ways You Can Help If you want to help in a different way: 
Please reach those that you know.
If you don't want to contribute you don't have to, just pray for me.  I could use a good prayer, not a laugh.
If you know a place in my area, whose employees rock when it comes to these car problems. Let me know please. Please use the Indiegogo share tools! 
 Than you so much for at least reading some of my History.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Become A Faces4Angels* Patron</h3>
<p>A new fundraising programme to enable SkyAngels to fly worldwide helping others when no one else will or can.</p>
<p>Free from political, religious and most importantly commercial considerations we wish to operate an international air ambulance &amp; rescue foundation with our own fleet of aircraft and helicopters. Help us to save money on our aircraft charter costs and give us the freedom to make instant life saving decisions.</p>
<p>We prefer to fly for free if possible or if we have too we only charge the direct operating costs.....no mark-up or profit is added. We believe every person should have the chance of a life saving flight or even a last flight home to be with their families when all else fails and they need to be with their family in their last hours.</p>

<br/><b>On Indiegogo every week you will see people trying to raise money for life-saving or life-enhancing flights. SkyAngels will offer these people and others worldwide a free or non-profit emergency flight on a dedicated air ambulance jet. <br/><br/>We also offer highly qualified medical crews for escort missions on airlines for those patients that do not require a dedicated air ambulance jet.

<p>Purchase outright a jet that will be a pre-owned example that can easily be converted into a air ambulance jet. The Gulfstream G111 could carry up to four stretcher's, infant incubators and a full emergency equipment fit, which would make these Flying Hospitals very very rare. We also like to fly with some family members on board if mission fit allows.<br/></p>
<p>We require 3 aircraft immediately subject to funding. Estimate required for all 3 jets is in the region of $3M+.

Become A Faces4Angels* Patron
A new fundraising programme to enable SkyAngels to fly worldwide helping others when no one else will or can.
Free from political, religious and most importantly commercial considerations we wish to operate an international air ambulance & rescue foundation with our own fleet of aircraft and helicopters. Help us to save money on our aircraft charter costs and give us the freedom to make instant life saving decisions.
We prefer to fly for free if possible or if we have too we only charge the direct operating costs.....no mark-up or profit is added. We believe every person should have the chance of a life saving flight or even a last flight home to be with their families when all else fails and they need to be with their family in their last hours.

On Indiegogo every week you will see people trying to raise money for life-saving or life-enhancing flights. SkyAngels will offer these people and others worldwide a free or non-profit emergency flight on a dedicated air ambulance jet. We also offer highly qualified medical crews for escort missions on airlines for those patients that do not require a dedicated air ambulance jet. We have operational contacts with over 90% of the worlds airlines and airports.
          
When an aeromedical flight request is received by our emergency operations room we ask for all the medical facts, contact the patients doctors, contact the receiving hospital and with due diligence cover all aspects of the flight request. SkyAngels offer a full international bed-bed service. Please see our list of missions we have been asked to complete in the last few weeks!FacesforAngels:







Become a Faces4Angels Patron today and have a photo of your face on our jet!

This photo could be of either you, a family member or a lost loved one, flying with us every day. Your face on our jet, helping others. We hope you like the idea and become one of our Faces4Angels.
We estimate that we could have 60,000 Faces4Angels photos on each Jet and we need more than one aircraft to complete the missions we are being asked to do every week.
Your photo will also be on our website and show that you are a Faces4Angels Patron or even a Patron Jet Shareholder. You will be able to write a short message to go with your photo on our website making it even more personal. Plus we can link this to your website, Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites.
Your Faces4Angels photo will enable us too..
Purchase outright a jet that will be a pre-owned example that can easily be converted into a air ambulance jet. The Gulfstream G111 could carry up to four stretcher's, infant incubators and a full emergency equipment fit, which would make these Flying Hospitals very very rare. We also like to fly with some family members on board if mission fit allows.
We require 3 aircraft immediately subject to funding. Estimate required for all 3 jets is in the region of $3M+. This campaign is for the first jet but if you like it we will carry on to purchase the 3 aircraft we require. Estimated operating costs of 3 jets worldwide is $6M. This Indiegogo campaign is just the start of our fundraising efforts to provide this vital service.Jet Bases:


One jet based in USA for North & South American missions. SkyAngels is a full international member of the Air Care Alliance in America. This aircraft will be operated on a non-profit community public benefit flying basis when not required for international emergency missions:
One jet based in England for Pan European missions. This aircraft will be operated on a non-profit NHS basis throughout Europe when not required for international emergency missions:

We hope to purchase outright these jet aircraft thereby saving interest rates and further finance costs. However if we do not reach the campaign total, we will use the amount raised and place it down as an aircraft deposit and lease the Gulfstream G3 aircraft (subject to finance approval and the amount raised): At the very least we will place your fantastic family photos onto our existing emergency response vehicles with a vehicle wrap.

<p>Willie Wilson, a 43 year old man, married for 21 years with 3 children was diagnosed with smoldering multiple myeloma, (a blood cancer that develops in the bone marrow) in October 2010 after several tests and a bone marrow biopsy showed 30% plasma cells. At that time his oncologist stated that he ""just needed monitoring"" as multiple myeloma is a very slow progressing disease. In November 2011 after increased fatigue, pain and difficulty walking, Willie was diagnosed with Stage 3 Multiple Myeloma. Skeletal surveys and CT scans revealed a large mass commonly called a plasmacytoma in the right hip bone, several small masses in the sacral bones and lower lumbar spine and several tiny lesions in the skull. Bone Marrow Biopsy results showed 90% malignant plasma cells. He has undergone multimodal neoplastic (radiation and chemotherapy) therapy but due to severe peripheral neuropathy and pulmonary emboli (lung blood clots) his chemotherapy was discontinued. The decision was made to proceed with an autologous stem cell transplant. He was referred to the Loyola Medical Cancer Center in Maywood IL. and is currently undergoing the stem cell transplant that began on July 2, 2012.</p>
<p>Willie is a devoted husband of 21 years and father of three with two of his children currently in college. He worked at ADM for the past 13 years until he became unable to continue his employment due to his disability.</p>
<p>We are asking your help to cover medical expenses, medications not covered by insurance, hotel and travel expenses related to the family being away from home for an extended period of time while Willie receives treatement. Any and all donations will be greatly appreciated. Please pass this information on to help us spread the word.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Bumper plates are extremely useful when performing heavy lifts.  They are designed to be the same height allowing you to drop them at any point while minimizing noise and damage to the floor.  Unfortunately, this same principle makes adding or removing the plates very difficult. Traditionally,there have only been a handful of solutions; none of which are ideal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564151208/egnkce7krzcsjqp6dhiw.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>None of these options are convenient.  People don't always have a lifting partner to help, you likely don't want to tire yourself out attempting to re rack the weight, and most gyms don't have a barbell jack.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><u>NEW SOLUTION</u></strong></p>
<p>The Bumper Block!  We designed this tool to be so small it can fit on your key chain, yet effective enough to accomplish everything the above methods do.  Simply set the Bumper Block on the floor, roll the first weight onto the block, then freely load or unload the bar with ease.  Whether you go to a fitness center or have your own home gym, the Bumper Block is the ultimate lifting partner!</p>

<h3>Bumper Block Design </h3>
<p>The Bumper Block was designed to be EFFECTIVE and CONVENIENT.  The effectiveness is worthless if it is not something that is easy to carry around with you.  It is for that reason we incorporated the following design aspects:</p>

Bumper plates are extremely useful when performing heavy lifts.  They are designed to be the same height allowing you to drop them at any point while minimizing noise and damage to the floor.  Unfortunately, this same principle makes adding or removing the plates very difficult. Traditionally,there have only been a handful of solutions; none of which are ideal.
 

None of these options are convenient.  People don't always have a lifting partner to help, you likely don't want to tire yourself out attempting to re rack the weight, and most gyms don't have a barbell jack.  
 
NEW SOLUTION
The Bumper Block!  We designed this tool to be so small it can fit on your key chain, yet effective enough to accomplish everything the above methods do.  Simply set the Bumper Block on the floor, roll the first weight onto the block, then freely load or unload the bar with ease.  Whether you go to a fitness center or have your own home gym, the Bumper Block is the ultimate lifting partner!
 

 

Bumper Block Design 
The Bumper Block was designed to be EFFECTIVE and CONVENIENT.  The effectiveness is worthless if it is not something that is easy to carry around with you.  It is for that reason we incorporated the following design aspects:

It comes with a pack of “Practice Cards”, which show 55 daily ideas and actions for dealing with anxiety and depression or living in recovery. Shuffle the pack, pick two cards, and build positive habits every day – Practice Cards are a way to make a game out of getting better.  More and more people are opening up about their struggles and searching for new ways to live with and talk about issues such as depression and anxiety. Torchlight & Practice Cards offer exactly that – and this campaign aims to bring them back into print and to reach a much broader audience. About Torchlight and the Practice Cards An experienced writer and editor, Kevin Braddock made Torchlight and the Practice Cards after suffering a major depressive episode in 2014. At the brink of suicide one day he asked for help, help came and he began slowly to recover. Guessing that speaking openly about breakdown, recovery, depression, and anxiety might help others deal with these problems, he decided to publish about his experiences and share the practices he learned.After Kevin’s story was picked up by Observer magazine, the first edition of Torchlight & the Practice Cards (designed by Enver Hadzijaj) sold out within a week. Most recently Laura Davis joined the team as business strategist, and along with our network of collaborators we share a vision of using these products as new ways of people to ask for help, tell stories and share their recovery practices.The response to the Torchlight project so far has been phenomenally positive. Kevin’s story for the Observer was shared 10,000 times, and further testimonials to the project include: “I cannot recommend Practice Cards more highly. Their simplicity is deceptive – they perfectly encapsulate how small daily steps, self compassion and connecting with others are absolutely invaluable in getting well and staying well. They’re more accessible than an app, they look nice, feel nice, they’re imaginative and what’s more, they will add some joy to your day” – Dr Jane McNeill, psychologist specialising in anxiety disorders and trauma  “I've been using the Practice Cards now for six months and they have made a huge difference to my life. It's so straightforward: shuffle the pack, deal yourself a couple of cards and you have two wonderfully engaging prompts to take you through the day” – David Baker, writer & broadcaster“I just wanted to email to say how amazing Torchlight is. I’ve read every word. So bold and candid and honest and raw AND compelling. It’s about so much more than depression. There’s so much everyone can relate to whatever their state of mind right now”  – Andrew Diprose, Creative Director, Wired UK“Anyone interested in magazines, storytelling and mental health should have a look at this. It's really, really good, and completely original”– Richard Benson, former Editor, The Face magazine, author of The Farm and The Valley“Practice Cards are a readily accessible tool for anyone who wants to carve out a bit of the day to look after their mental health. They don't demand continued devotion as a meditation app might – pick them up and use them as and when you really need to"" – Charlotte Hillenbrand, Director of People, Made by Many“Torchlight System offers fantastically useful tools.

When I sweat the colostomy bag fails and I need a cooler climate while undergoing chemotherapy. When I am on chemo I experience nausea and loss of appetite. I have found that marijuana offsets these symptoms and I will go where I can receive legal treatment.    I am moving to Portland, Oregon after happily being in New Orleans for thirty years. I have a ride with a kind friend to Oakland, California where I will take the train to Portland. I need help with the expenses of moving my belongings. Assist me in shipping one pallet (500 lbs) from New Orleans. In addition, I expect that my expenses will exceed my stipend by $200 a month for the first 3 months after I arrive. I am asking for $1,200.$600 for the move$600 for $50 a week for 12 weeks  Come to my going away party on the 19th at 2735 C Toulouse in New Orleans where funders will Tar, Feather, and Run me out of town!

<h3><b><b>We're here to change that with a new, revolutionary idea.</b>  </b></h3>
<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The
	earth's seawater, artesian sources, and contaminated surface waters can
	be purified into clean drinking water.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Current
	purification methods are old, expensive and leave waste that is
	harmful to our environment.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have developed an innovative technical solution for the
	purification and desalination of water. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	We
	use powerful ultrasound to blast impure water into particles of less
	than 10 microns. These micro-particles evaporate and condense to
	form pure water. This process leaves the salts, contaminants and sediments behind. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	 Our
	systems can be operated using waste heat and renewable energy,
	which reduces costs for communal use. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Energy
	costs are kept low, meaning this method can be efficiently deployed
	on a large, commercial scale. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	The
	Alpha prototype for our system has already been tested in a lab. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	We're
	preparing for the next phase - building the Beta prototypes for
	commercial use. 
	</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	These
	will be tested in a UK laboratory  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Heading
	up our team of scientists and engineers is Dr. Vladimir Shkapa, one
	of the world's leading experts in the field of ultrasound. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Dr
	Shkapa has years of experience working with NASA, the Ukraine
	Space Agency and the Ukraine National Design Agency.</p>

<h3><span style=""line-height: 26px;""></span></h3>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Our Alpha Prototype </b><b>proved that our technology works in lab conditions</b>. Now we plan to build the Beta Prototypes for commercial use.</p>
<p><b>We need to build 3 Beta Prototypes, </b>and the projected cost for building these is <b>$300,000 USD. </b>We need three of them to ensure that we can perform tests at the highest regimes possible and should some tests damage a prototype or internal details we will have immediate back-ups to continue our work.</p>
<p></p>
<p>
The
Aquavus Beta Prototypes will employ unique ultrasound units capable
of a spray of a minimum of 10 litres per hour, producing 5-micron
droplets, and consuming a maximum of 200-300 watts of electrical
power.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>From the Beta Prototypes we will get the information we need and test all the necessary elements and parameters for optimising and producing the next phase, which is the final design of the industrial units for mass production. The plan is that each industrial unit will yield a minimum of 2 liters/ minute of distilled water.</p>
<b>We will test the Beta Prototypes at a certified UK laboratory.</b><p></p>
<p>Our team of scientists are calculating the exact capacity, electrical energy, and thermal power required for the final machines. The Beta Prototypes will also be tested against extreme temperatures, climates and in environments with limited resources. Our priority is to ensure they are durable in remote, inhospitable desert or tropical climates. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/760174/files/20140801145218-2014-08-01_19.25.16.jpg?1406929938"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""/></p>
<p><b>Our
Method.   </b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>• The method exploits totally new technology in the field of water distillation. Our unique ultrasound technology blasts water into a huge surface area made up of minute droplets. </p>
<p>After these evaporated water droplets have passed through the Aquavus chambers and a special Separator, pure distilled water is collected. </p>
<p>• Because these minute droplets of liquid form a huge surface area, much less energy and time are needed than existing technologies. This makes Aquavus economically and environmentally sound. Our groundbreaking process utilises much less energy than traditional distillation and reverse osmosis processes.  </p>

<p><b>Let's change our social landscape. Join with us to help end thirst - one of the biggest global challenges of our time.</b></p>
<p>By building the final Aquavus systems, we'll be able to help quench the world's desperate need for clean water. By licensing our ground-breaking technology, chosen vendors across the world can be a part of this unique journey.   <b> </b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>We
currently estimate the units will yield a
minimum output of <strong>2 litres/min</strong>. This means an Aquavus Seawater Unit of 1.5 X 1.5 X 1.5 metres  will produce at least <strong>120 litres/hour</strong> of clean, safe, purified water. An Aquavus Artesian and Surface Water Unit of 1 X 1 X 1 metres will do the same. </p>

<p>Every single day we hear more and more about the negative situations concerning the water on our planet and we can only come to one conclusion. It's a stark and undeniable fact that we have indeed reached a crisis point where drinkable and potable water are disappearing at alarming rates. </p>
<p>And the crisis is no longer confined to the developing world. Even in the developed world, in places like California, drought is so severe it’s having a grave economic impact on resources.   </p>
<p><b>The Washington Post reported scientists
estimate 63 trillion gallons of water have been lost in the drought.
</b>Governor
Jerry Brown has called for Californians to reduce water use by 20
percent voluntarily, and mandatory rationing could be ordered so
that homes, businesses and farms don’t run dry. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/839781/files/20140907001544-CaliforniaDroughtFolsom__1_.jpg?1410074144"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>As
the increasing unpredictability of weather patterns leads governments
and municipalities to look at new water infrastructure investments, drought-ravaged California could
be a large potential contributor to the 19% annual growth expectations in
the global desalination market.  </p>
<p></p>

In
California alone, 15 desalination projects are proposed along the
coast from Carlsbad to Los Angeles and up to San Francisco Bay.</p>
<p>
The
International Desalination Association (IDA) has challenged the
industry to achieve a further reduction of 20% in energy requirements
for seawater desalination by 2015 – to be achieved through a
combination of the integration of renewable energy, the use of lower
pressure solutions and potential advances in membrane technologies. </p>

<p><b><b>We
have a solution. Aquavus, our revolutionary and innovative water
purification and desalination system, can be used
for seawater, artesian sources and contaminated surface
waters. Our process requires very little heat and energy.
We use low pressure pumps that are inexpensive to operate and
maintain. </b></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>What's more, the CO2 impact of our technology is minimal. With our unique system, partial or full integration of purification and desalination with renewable energy sources is possible.</p>
<p><b>Aquavus can be used for a city or a village.</b></p>
<p><b><b></b></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>According to the United Nations Development Program the average water use per day per person i<strong>n France is 280 litres, and in Germany it's 180 litres</strong>. Thus, a single Aquavus unit can provide for at least 10 people per day in developed nations. </p>
<p>However, the scale of water usage in a village in the developing world is much different. According to the United Nations each villager uses about 20 litres of water a day for drinking, cooking, and bathing, which is typical in a developing village. <b> </b></p>
<p><b>In a village, just one Aquavus unit could supply</b> <b>enough clean water to support the needs of 150 people per day.  In real-terms, this translates to millions of lives saved.  </b><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></b></p>

<p><b></b></p>
<p> <i>Artist's rendition of a Solar Powered Aquavus Artesian Unit in a village.</i></p>
<p>The smart design of our mobile Aquavus technology even allows multiple units to work in tandem. This is absolutely vital in mass relief operations, emergency situations, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, droughts and conflict zones.   </p>
<p><b>Aquavus is expected to have a broad global impact on the production and distribution of water at substantially lower costs than existing technologies.  </b></p>
<p>Our goal is to keep the final products at prices below $1,000.00 for the seawater unit and $500.00 for the artesian and surface water units. </p>
<p>Combined with lower energy costs, makes it substantially cheaper than any other existing systems of water desalination and purification producing the same litres per hour (LPH) of water per unit. </p>
<p><b>We plan to produce modular units which can be assembled serially like a “Lego set”. Aquavus is a “plug and play” device. </b> </p>
<p>Economies of scale will also apply and provide greater cost advantages due to the scale, size, and/or output of operation. Costs per Aquavus unit will decrease with increasing scale as fixed costs are spread out over more units. Operational efficiency will also be greater with increasing scale, leading to lower variable costs as well. </p>
<p>Many water-hungry industrial applications (such as agriculture, mining and fracking) focus on the need for sustainable/closed-loop systems that meet the requirements of local legislation. We believe that smaller scale units and mobile, modular systems have a big future in the water industry.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>We
see Aquavus establishing itself as a worldwide pioneer in the water
industry, </b>through
further execution of our business plan, building upon key strategic
joint-ventures, production and distribution outsourcing,
pilot-projects with public works/public water distribution services,
labelling, licensing, consulting and other partnering relationships
with both private firms and public agencies already well-established
within the water production and distribution sector.   </p>
<p><b>We have already had great success with our Alpha Prototype, which we built to prove the technology works.</b></p>

<div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul><li><p><b><b>We originally designed the Aquavus system to find a solution for arsenic contaminated ground water in Bangladesh</b>.</b></p></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><p>The arsenic crisis in Bangladesh is rightly described as the worst case of mass poisoning in the history of mankind.</p></li>
<li><p>Approximately 46 million people are forced to choose between arsenic-laced ground water or biologically contaminated surface water. Given the choice between slow death by poisoning or immediate sickness with water-borne pathogens – the local population inevitably chooses the arsenic-laced ground water.</p></li>
<li><p>The test results were in line with our expectations. The lab results from the Alpha Prototype revealed <b>99% purity from the purification of contaminated water containing arsenic.</b></p></li>
<li><p>The success of the Alpha Prototype led us to expand our unique technology to incorporate seawater desalination and many other environmental 	water problems that mankind faces today.  </p></li>
</ul>
<h3 style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;""><i><br/></i></h3>
<h3 style=""font-style: italic; font-weight: bold; color: blue;""><i>Risks &amp; Challenges  </i></h3>
<ul><li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Currently, Aquavus Ltd. is primarily a research and development partnership, but our business strategy calls for finalising a series of prototype products utilising a core “ultrasound reactor” and related processes technology within all of our products. </span></li></ul>
<ul><li>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Financial Challenges </b>- <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our operational plan, and therefore our financial plan, calls for the adequate capitalisation of the company throughout the first two years of operations without any sales. The initial sale of products will begin taking place in earnest during year three of the plan. As a result, we need to obtain enough financial backing for product development from the Beta Prototypes stage through to the completion of the industrial samples. </span>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Technical Challenges - </b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The technical challenges are connected primarily to our ultrasound sprayers for the atomisation of source-water. The most important element is the time period the sprayers function before replacement or refurbishment. We expect that we can use them continuously 24/7 for at least one year at temperatures between 50 C and 95 C inside the machines. However we have not yet tested them for such a sustained period of time.</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">We have not yet decided on the final technologies for the disposal or collection of salt particles. We know that the existing methods of salt disposal in current reverse osmosis and thermal technologies are inadequate. We need to conduct further experiments regarding whether or not the salts in our system should be collected in dried form, returned to the source-water in a diluted form through diffusers or a combination of both. There must be flexibility regarding solutions. These are technical issues that need to be finally formulated by our team of scientists.</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Technical Solutions </b>- <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our plan is to test the sprayers continuously during the year in which we will construct the Beta Prototypes, and make any necessary design corrections to them.</span>
</li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Regarding the salts that are removed from source-waters, our goal is to use the safest method possible in regards to the environmental impact of the process. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul><li>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Product Pricing Challenges </b>- <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Although our goal is to keep the final products at prices below $1,000.00 for the seawater unit and $500.00 for the artesian and surface water units, we have a two year lead time before the units can be produced so the costs may go up more than initially projected.  </span>
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Future Improvements </b>- <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Presently, the Beta Prototypes will contain all the necessary elements for testing in order to produce an industrial sample with parameters of creating units producing 5 micron droplets and a minimum of 2 liters per minute of distilled water. In future we are interested in producing smaller droplets and expanding sprayer output in order to further increase efficiency and yield. </span>

""Bhopal, A Prayer For Rain"" is inspired by the 1984 Union Carbide disaster
in Bhopal, India, which is considered to be the world's worst
industrial disaster. </b>Over 10,000 people died and at least 558,000
were injured as chemicals leaked from the American plant. The
film was recently screened at the UN for the 2014 General
Assembly for world leaders.</p>
<p>The fact that the chemicals released in the 1984 gas explosion continue to contaminate the groundwater in Bhopal, compelled Ravi to join the Aquavus project and team. <b>The</b> <b>groundwater in Bhopal still has concentrations of carbon tetrachloride – a carcinogen that affects the liver, kidneys and central nervous system – which are 2,400 times above World Health Organization guidelines. </b></p>

GLOBAL WATER CRISIS!


Our planet is running out of drinkable water. 
By 2025, clean water will be in scarce supply. 
What can we do about it?  



                         John Fitzgerald Kennedy
 ""If we could ever competitively, at a cheap rate, get fresh water from saltwater, that would be in the long range interests of humanity and would really dwarf any other scientific accomplishment."" 
Introducing AQUAVUS:  
 Artist's Rendition of an Aquavus Seawater Unit.
   





Worth a thousand words. All the water in the world (1.4087 billion cubic kilometers) including sea water, ice, lakes, rivers, ground water, clouds, etc. gathered into balls. Shown on the same scale as the Earth. It's shocking to see how little clean water is available for our use and now it's disappearing.

 








To
find out more about how the scarcity of safe water is affecting our world, please
visit the following links: 



(http://news.yahoo.com/katie-couric-matt-damon-w...)

(http://water.org)
(http://thewaterproject.org/water_scarcity)


We're here to change that with a new, revolutionary idea.  




The
	earth's seawater, artesian sources, and contaminated surface waters can
	be purified into clean drinking water.


Current
	purification methods are old, expensive and leave waste that is
	harmful to our environment.  


We have developed an innovative technical solution for the
	purification and desalination of water. 
	



	We
	use powerful ultrasound to blast impure water into particles of less
	than 10 microns. These micro-particles evaporate and condense to
	form pure water. This process leaves the salts, contaminants and sediments behind. 



	 Our
	systems can be operated using waste heat and renewable energy,
	which reduces costs for communal use. 
	



	Energy
	costs are kept low, meaning this method can be efficiently deployed
	on a large, commercial scale. 



	The
	Alpha prototype for our system has already been tested in a lab. 
	



	We're
	preparing for the next phase - building the Beta prototypes for
	commercial use. 
	



	These
	will be tested in a UK laboratory  



	Heading
	up our team of scientists and engineers is Dr. Vladimir Shkapa, one
	of the world's leading experts in the field of ultrasound. 



	Dr
	Shkapa has years of experience working with NASA, the Ukraine
	Space Agency and the Ukraine National Design Agency.

Most
	revolutionary ideas make our world a better place - we hope you'll
	join us on our quest for a better future for our planet.




What Do We Need?  

We need YOU to help us. 



SAVE ENERGY!       SAVE WATER!        SAVE LIVES!  



Our Alpha Prototype proved that our technology works in lab conditions. Now we plan to build the Beta Prototypes for commercial use.
We need to build 3 Beta Prototypes, and the projected cost for building these is $300,000 USD. We need three of them to ensure that we can perform tests at the highest regimes possible and should some tests damage a prototype or internal details we will have immediate back-ups to continue our work.


The
Aquavus Beta Prototypes will employ unique ultrasound units capable
of a spray of a minimum of 10 litres per hour, producing 5-micron
droplets, and consuming a maximum of 200-300 watts of electrical
power.  

From the Beta Prototypes we will get the information we need and test all the necessary elements and parameters for optimising and producing the next phase, which is the final design of the industrial units for mass production. The plan is that each industrial unit will yield a minimum of 2 liters/ minute of distilled water.
We will test the Beta Prototypes at a certified UK laboratory.
Our team of scientists are calculating the exact capacity, electrical energy, and thermal power required for the final machines. The Beta Prototypes will also be tested against extreme temperatures, climates and in environments with limited resources. Our priority is to ensure they are durable in remote, inhospitable desert or tropical climates. 
Our
Method.   

• The method exploits totally new technology in the field of water distillation. Our unique ultrasound technology blasts water into a huge surface area made up of minute droplets. 
After these evaporated water droplets have passed through the Aquavus chambers and a special Separator, pure distilled water is collected. 
• Because these minute droplets of liquid form a huge surface area, much less energy and time are needed than existing technologies. This makes Aquavus economically and environmentally sound. Our groundbreaking process utilises much less energy than traditional distillation and reverse osmosis processes.  

Ultrasound Sprayer  

Let's change our social landscape. Join with us to help end thirst - one of the biggest global challenges of our time.
By building the final Aquavus systems, we'll be able to help quench the world's desperate need for clean water. By licensing our ground-breaking technology, chosen vendors across the world can be a part of this unique journey.    

We
currently estimate the units will yield a
minimum output of 2 litres/min. This means an Aquavus Seawater Unit of 1.5 X 1.5 X 1.5 metres  will produce at least 120 litres/hour of clean, safe, purified water. An Aquavus Artesian and Surface Water Unit of 1 X 1 X 1 metres will do the same. 

Artist's Rendition of an Aquavus Seawater Unit of 1.5 X 1.5 X 1.5 metres 


Artist's Rendition of an Aquavus Artesian and Surface Water Unit of 1 X 1 X 1 metres 
We plan to purify more than 3,000 litres of seawater, artesian sources or contaminated water per day from just one Aquavus unit.

AQUAVUS for Disaster Relief
Because of the mobile and modular design of the units we will also be able to provide clean water in mass relief operations and emergency situations such as earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, storm-waters, droughts, conflict zones, etc.     

Our Back Up Goals 

If
we do not reach our financial goals on Indiegogo, we will use the
funds we have raised to continue testing and improving our spray
technology. At
the same time we will continue patenting our technology worldwide. 


The Impact
""What we do with our world, right now, will propagate down through the centuries and powerfully affect the destiny of our descendants."" 

Carl Sagan
Every single day we hear more and more about the negative situations concerning the water on our planet and we can only come to one conclusion. It's a stark and undeniable fact that we have indeed reached a crisis point where drinkable and potable water are disappearing at alarming rates. 
And the crisis is no longer confined to the developing world. Even in the developed world, in places like California, drought is so severe it’s having a grave economic impact on resources.   
The Washington Post reported scientists
estimate 63 trillion gallons of water have been lost in the drought.
Governor
Jerry Brown has called for Californians to reduce water use by 20
percent voluntarily, and mandatory rationing could be ordered so
that homes, businesses and farms don’t run dry. 


As
the increasing unpredictability of weather patterns leads governments
and municipalities to look at new water infrastructure investments, drought-ravaged California could
be a large potential contributor to the 19% annual growth expectations in
the global desalination market.  


NASA images show California's drought deepening.  




In
California alone, 15 desalination projects are proposed along the
coast from Carlsbad to Los Angeles and up to San Francisco Bay.

The
International Desalination Association (IDA) has challenged the
industry to achieve a further reduction of 20% in energy requirements
for seawater desalination by 2015 – to be achieved through a
combination of the integration of renewable energy, the use of lower
pressure solutions and potential advances in membrane technologies. 





Artist's rendition of Aquavus Seawater Units joined together in a Desalination Plant.

We
have a solution. Aquavus, our revolutionary and innovative water
purification and desalination system, can be used
for seawater, artesian sources and contaminated surface
waters. Our process requires very little heat and energy.
We use low pressure pumps that are inexpensive to operate and
maintain. 

What's more, the CO2 impact of our technology is minimal. With our unique system, partial or full integration of purification and desalination with renewable energy sources is possible.
Aquavus can be used for a city or a village.


According to the United Nations Development Program the average water use per day per person in France is 280 litres, and in Germany it's 180 litres. Thus, a single Aquavus unit can provide for at least 10 people per day in developed nations. 
However, the scale of water usage in a village in the developing world is much different. According to the United Nations each villager uses about 20 litres of water a day for drinking, cooking, and bathing, which is typical in a developing village.  
In a village, just one Aquavus unit could supply enough clean water to support the needs of 150 people per day.  In real-terms, this translates to millions of lives saved.  


 Artist's rendition of a Solar Powered Aquavus Artesian Unit in a village.
The smart design of our mobile Aquavus technology even allows multiple units to work in tandem. This is absolutely vital in mass relief operations, emergency situations, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, droughts and conflict zones.   
Aquavus is expected to have a broad global impact on the production and distribution of water at substantially lower costs than existing technologies.  
Our goal is to keep the final products at prices below $1,000.00 for the seawater unit and $500.00 for the artesian and surface water units. 
Combined with lower energy costs, makes it substantially cheaper than any other existing systems of water desalination and purification producing the same litres per hour (LPH) of water per unit. 
We plan to produce modular units which can be assembled serially like a “Lego set”. Aquavus is a “plug and play” device.  
Economies of scale will also apply and provide greater cost advantages due to the scale, size, and/or output of operation. Costs per Aquavus unit will decrease with increasing scale as fixed costs are spread out over more units. Operational efficiency will also be greater with increasing scale, leading to lower variable costs as well. 
Many water-hungry industrial applications (such as agriculture, mining and fracking) focus on the need for sustainable/closed-loop systems that meet the requirements of local legislation. We believe that smaller scale units and mobile, modular systems have a big future in the water industry.  

We
see Aquavus establishing itself as a worldwide pioneer in the water
industry, through
further execution of our business plan, building upon key strategic
joint-ventures, production and distribution outsourcing,
pilot-projects with public works/public water distribution services,
labelling, licensing, consulting and other partnering relationships
with both private firms and public agencies already well-established
within the water production and distribution sector.   
We have already had great success with our Alpha Prototype, which we built to prove the technology works.



 Alpha Prototype, Condensing Chambers, Pump and Ultrasound Electronics



How did we come up with Aquavus? 



We originally designed the Aquavus system to find a solution for arsenic contaminated ground water in Bangladesh.

The arsenic crisis in Bangladesh is rightly described as the worst case of mass poisoning in the history of mankind.
Approximately 46 million people are forced to choose between arsenic-laced ground water or biologically contaminated surface water. Given the choice between slow death by poisoning or immediate sickness with water-borne pathogens – the local population inevitably chooses the arsenic-laced ground water.
The test results were in line with our expectations. The lab results from the Alpha Prototype revealed 99% purity from the purification of contaminated water containing arsenic.
The success of the Alpha Prototype led us to expand our unique technology to incorporate seawater desalination and many other environmental 	water problems that mankind faces today.  


Risks & Challenges  
Currently, Aquavus Ltd. is primarily a research and development partnership, but our business strategy calls for finalising a series of prototype products utilising a core “ultrasound reactor” and related processes technology within all of our products. 

Financial Challenges - Our operational plan, and therefore our financial plan, calls for the adequate capitalisation of the company throughout the first two years of operations without any sales. The initial sale of products will begin taking place in earnest during year three of the plan. As a result, we need to obtain enough financial backing for product development from the Beta Prototypes stage through to the completion of the industrial samples. 



Technical Challenges - The technical challenges are connected primarily to our ultrasound sprayers for the atomisation of source-water. The most important element is the time period the sprayers function before replacement or refurbishment. We expect that we can use them continuously 24/7 for at least one year at temperatures between 50 C and 95 C inside the machines. However we have not yet tested them for such a sustained period of time.


We have not yet decided on the final technologies for the disposal or collection of salt particles. We know that the existing methods of salt disposal in current reverse osmosis and thermal technologies are inadequate. We need to conduct further experiments regarding whether or not the salts in our system should be collected in dried form, returned to the source-water in a diluted form through diffusers or a combination of both. There must be flexibility regarding solutions. These are technical issues that need to be finally formulated by our team of scientists.




Technical Solutions - Our plan is to test the sprayers continuously during the year in which we will construct the Beta Prototypes, and make any necessary design corrections to them.

Regarding the salts that are removed from source-waters, our goal is to use the safest method possible in regards to the environmental impact of the process. 


Product Pricing Challenges - Although our goal is to keep the final products at prices below $1,000.00 for the seawater unit and $500.00 for the artesian and surface water units, we have a two year lead time before the units can be produced so the costs may go up more than initially projected.  



Future Improvements - Presently, the Beta Prototypes will contain all the necessary elements for testing in order to produce an industrial sample with parameters of creating units producing 5 micron droplets and a minimum of 2 liters per minute of distilled water. In future we are interested in producing smaller droplets and expanding sprayer output in order to further increase efficiency and yield.

""Bhopal, A Prayer For Rain"" is inspired by the 1984 Union Carbide disaster
in Bhopal, India, which is considered to be the world's worst
industrial disaster. Over 10,000 people died and at least 558,000
were injured as chemicals leaked from the American plant. The
film was recently screened at the UN for the 2014 General
Assembly for world leaders.
The fact that the chemicals released in the 1984 gas explosion continue to contaminate the groundwater in Bhopal, compelled Ravi to join the Aquavus project and team. The groundwater in Bhopal still has concentrations of carbon tetrachloride – a carcinogen that affects the liver, kidneys and central nervous system – which are 2,400 times above World Health Organization guidelines.

If you climb on cliffs steeper than this, you’re compensating by craning your neck. The EyeSend field of view is adjustable from 60° to 120°. Belayers can use this range of adjustment to maintain a neutral, pain-free neck position while belaying, regardless of the cliff angle. A more comfortable belay is a safer belay, for both the climber and belayer.PitchSix believes in helping to sustain the outdoor environments that make climbing great. We have pledged to the 1% for the Planet movement and will plant a tree for every pair of EyeSend glasses sold. Read more below. Save your neck! Help offset climate change! Pledge to support EyeSend!What Climbers are SayingThese Climbers Have a Pair From Our Pilot Build:""These glasses are amazing! The adjustable feature allows you to stand in a comfortable position without craning your neck to see your belayer. Who knew such a simple addition to belay glasses could be so revolutionary!?"" -- Beth Rodden, Mother, Pro Climber, Writer“The adjustability in the PitchSix EyeSend is a game changer. As a climber with a severely injured neck, I am forced to rely on belay glasses for all belaying. I have made do with what was on offer for too long and suffered when belaying for anything but very short periods. The moveable lens in the EyeSend gives me a better range of vision than anything else I’ve used, and allows me to belay for way longer, with basically zero discomfort. Thanks PitchSix!” -- Liam Lonsdale. Passionate climber, professional photographer, pursuer of excellence.""The  adjustable feature is brilliant! This fixes my biggest problem with my (previous) belay glasses--my neck never quite could get into a relaxed  position. You have solved this problem!""  --Eric Hörst.   Climber * Author * Performance Coach * Researcher * Speaker""I see climbers with tight necks all the time in my clinic. Cranking your neck up to give a good belay is not what your spine is meant to do. The adjustable EyeSend glasses are way better than regular belay glasses at letting you keep a neutral neck position while not losing sight of your climber. All belayers should get a pair!"" -- Dr. Tyler Nelson.  Camp4 Human Performance, DC, MS, CSCS""A clever improvement on a crucial piece of cragging kit.  But be  warned; I got some strange looks when I wore them to the bar."" -- Cedar Wright.  Professional Climber and Filmmaker…God Among MenEyeSend Key Features

<h3>My niece 4 year old Jacey Jo was diagnosed with A.L.L. lukemia in March. Jacey is a spunky, silly little girl who always had a smile on her face.

The high doses of prenisone have her moody at times but her ""happy"" place has been in the cafeteria of the hospial. Jacey's Mom reported to us the other day that Jacey has now started to lose her eye lashes, her beautiful blond curly locks of hair are starting to thin as well. This was the hardest for Jacey to deal with. She got very upset when her Mom explained to her that she would lose her hair. But when the childrens hospital asked her what color of hair she wanted for her wig she smiled and said, ""hot pink""! So of course she will have hot pink hair. Such a awesome personality for a little girl who is going through heck right now.</h3>
<h3>Jacey's Mother is my sister and a single Mother to 4 children. Jacey is her youngest. She also has a 9 year old son who has special needs. She works a full time job caring for her children. She is loving, caring, compasionate and lives for her children.  She HAS to be able to stay with her daughter while she is battling lukemia. Being a single Mom makes it IMPOSSIBLE. She has NO extra income coming in at this time only enough to sustain the family. She is away from her three other children, in a different town at the hospital. So not seeing them everyday is so hard for them all. She has a wonderful man in her life who stepped up to help care for the other children and she has family who is helping her to care for the children..</h3>

Then I began thinking about the tremendous love, support and encouragement I have received throughout this journey and I'm so thankful I have such amazing, supportive friends that have offered their help in any way. The birth of my baby, Jairo Valentino, came 3 weeks early and because I set up this page late, the birthing center has been generous enough to extend my payment plan to six weeks after the birth in order for them to provide me with the birth I'd always dreamed of.  For those who might be unfamiliar with home water births, I've included a video that gives some reasons why women choose an out of hospital birth. For me, birth is natural and it's also a right of passage. Bringing another human into this earth is a very sacred event and I wanted to feel the experience by taking an active role in the process of birthing my baby. I knew this home birth would offer my baby a more peaceful journey from my womb and into my arms and thats exactly what I experienced!! My birth experience was blissful and peaceful! I had a great support team that included my midwife and her assistant, my doula, my best friend, baby dad and my mom. I was able to labor comfortably in warm water with a candle lit setting, singing bowls, massages and loving encouragement from my loved ones! It was truly a euphoric experience!You're contribution will not only assist me in paying for this magical experience but also give me the opportunity to spend the first couple of months of Jairo Valentino's life without having to work. Because I had been working independently, I don't have the luxury of getting a paid maternity leave.Being able to bond with my lil love during the first couple of months, is a TREMENDOUS gift. Your support will bring me so much relief and allow me to focus on my baby.There are only 4 days left before this campaign closes and I'm asking for your support in order to make this a smooth transition for me. You will be supporting me in a huge way and it is a great help!Thank you so much for reading my entire page, I appreciate all of you!Love, peace and blessings,Carolina Lopez Arango",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Caregiver Statements About Safety Issue     Alerta is a 7-day disposable patch to tell a caregiver their loved one has wandered. Alerta & Wedge work together using radio frequency to help a caregiver monitor a loved one.    Alarms when a loved one wanders 

 
 Alerta is a, closed loop, disposable patch to assist in the individual care of a loved one living at home, for example, a person with Alzheimer’s dementia or an Autistic child. Alerta is worn by a loved one and monitored with a Wedge ( receiver) by the caregiver. The Wedge will notify the caregiver with an audible and visual alarm if the loved one wanders from home or a safe zone of approximately 75 feet. This allows the caregiver to sleep, shower, or do daily activities with some peace of mind. Peace of Mind in a Patch""Informal Caregivers"" Alerta is very exciting. It will make a significant impact on humanity by relieving some of the stress of “Informal Caregivers” who are providing 24/7 monitoring of their loved ones.The need is growing every day.  The Wedge The Wedge is dedicated to one job, to let the caregiver know if a loved one wanders. The batteries last for months so it works 24/7"" and is not subject to interruptions or connection fees.  
Easy Replacement
 After 7 days the Wedge signals the caregiver to remove Alerta (used patch). The caregiver peels the adhesive covering on the new Alerta (patch) and applies it beside to reduce skin irritation. Doesn't need charging like a GPS tracker Alerta uses R.F technology paired with improved medical grade skin adhesion in a disposable patch the size of a tea bag.Some devices that use GPS or cell phones need to be plugged in daily and can leave a loved one vulnerable  The Caregiver removes Alerta (patch) from the shipping card. They push the “On” switch located on Alerta. The Caregiver removes the film protecting the adhesive on the back of Alerta (patch)The Caregiver applies Alerta (patch) to a clean hair free area in the upper lumbar region of their loved ones back. Peace of Mind in a Patch! The Caregiver brings the Wedge within 3’ of the loved one after Alerta (Patch) is on and wait for the signal indicator to light up. The Wedge will notify the caregiver with an audible and visual indicator if their loved one wanders from an approximate 75’ radius. This area is typical of most homes. When the Wedge alarms, immediately go and retrieve your loved one. The Wedge will reset itself when the patch is back in range.    Size The size of a tea bag. Alerta is very soft and flexible.  Waterproof Waterproof and lasts for 7 days of normal activities. R.F Technology A low power sub 1Ghz RF transmitter designed to be used on the body. Alerta sends identification packets every few seconds to the Wedge to monitor the distance that the wearer is from the wedge. Easy to use Applied to a location on the upper back with a medical grade long term adhesive. Alerta is almost undetectable.   Size The Wedge shape makes it easy to hold and smaller than a smartphone. Audible Alarm The Wedge has an audible alarm that notifies a caregiver if a loved one wanders day or night from a safe zone. Fits Anywhere  The Wedge easily fits in a shirt pocket or purse and rests on a table or nightstand. Lasts For 6 Months The Wedge last for 6 months before the battery needs replaced with normal use. Easy to use The Wedge receives ID packets from Alerta (patch) and notifies a caregiver when loved one wanders from a safe zone with an audible as well as a visual notification.The Wedge informs the caregiver when it is time to change Alerta.      Safety Zone Range About 75 feet depending on your home.  Caregiver Statements About Safety Zone  

 

 
 
 

 
In the course the development, we have tested the potential acceptance of this product with actual caregivers and have had an overwhelming acceptance.
 

 
  In the last two years, we have developed two different approaches to the implementation of the product. This development yielded engineering models but not a product ready designs. Today we are working on the production version and we will have pre-production models early in 2019. We should have deliverable product in June of 2019.
 
  The funds we generate are to help us finish the development and deliver Alerta to market.  In supporting this project you are helping provide caregivers with a product that will help prevent wandering by impaired loved ones. Alerta helps reduce the stress on caregivers who are normally members of the family. The product helps make impaired people secure. Please support caregivers and their loved ones by supporting Alerta.",44.0,4,"1 Campaign

<p>iMARVEL is finished by 9 steps of processes and one of the most important processes is to test the limit of weight that iMARVEL can stand.</p>
<p>We will tell you the hidden story about the weight of the product that can be stuck to iMARVEL during the development.</p>
<p>Do you know the weight of the heaviest smartphone?</p>
<p>iPhone6 Plus - 172g </p>
<p>Galaxy Note5 - 171g</p>
<p>We guess that the weight of the heaviest smartphone equipped with all possible cases and covers will not exceed 230g.</p>
<p>What we have used during the development was an iron mock-up that resembles a smartphone case.</p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464844152/main23_gt8d3h.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Have you ever seen a smartphone case made of iron? We guess that you have never ever seen such a thing.</p>
<p>Give it a try to guess the weight of the iron smartphone case.</p>
<p>We had two iron smartphone cases. The first one weighed 405g and the other one weighed 414g.</p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464844353/main24_djqqcq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p>The picture shows the iron smartphone case stuck to iMARVEL. It didn’t fall off from iMARVEL once being stuck to it.</p>
<p>So it would be absolutely fine with iMARVEL no matter what kind of smartphones you use.</p>

</div></div>","There has been no smartphone holder that fulfills needs for various situations that make you fix your smartphones. But you can experience greater comfort and freedom for both of your hands with iMarvel than using existing smartphone stands.Adhesion technology used in iMarvel is the patented one making it easy for you to stick your smartphone to and remove it. iMARVEL is also a product that you can use it in your daily life anywhere and anytime. You may use something to which you can attach your goods and keep using it in that way. But if you need something detachable, iMARVEL will be your one and only solution in the world. We have participated in this campaign so that we can secure funding to produce of patented materials and print required for iMarvel.
 

 
 
 


iMarvel is a versatile, practical and aesthetically good looking product that will bring extra convenience to your life.
iMarvel will make you enjoy the freedom to use both of your hands while putting your smartphone on a smooth and flat surface in different places and situations of your life and its stylish design will also serve as part of your interior props.
 
You can use iMARVEL in every place of your lifestyle.
You can attach iMARVEL next to TV in the living room and you don’t need to look for the remote controller anymore. You can place iMARVEL in your children’s rooms and they will no longer have to look for their stationery all over the rooms.
 

You can also use iMARVEL in kitchen, bathroom, living room and on dressing table and it will bring whole new convenience to you when using in your car. In addition, iMARVEL is a magic pad available for any kind of places including offices and stores.




 




iMarvel is a collaboration between technical skills of Winic and decent designs of an illustrator named Geumhwang, and part of her artworks applied to iMarvel products are displayed in Creative Talking Gallery at COEX Aquarium.
We have combined convenient functions with paintings by Geumhwang to create iMarvel with handy functions and decent designs.
Geumhwang always thinks of people who will feel comfortable and happy with her works before starting to draw.
So we also hope you can feel comfortable and happy with paintings on iMarvel.
 
  
 
 Story behind the development of iMARVEL
 


 
iMARVEL is finished by 9 steps of processes and one of the most important processes is to test the limit of weight that iMARVEL can stand.
We will tell you the hidden story about the weight of the product that can be stuck to iMARVEL during the development.
Do you know the weight of the heaviest smartphone?
iPhone6 Plus - 172g 
Galaxy Note5 - 171g
We guess that the weight of the heaviest smartphone equipped with all possible cases and covers will not exceed 230g.
What we have used during the development was an iron mock-up that resembles a smartphone case.

 
Have you ever seen a smartphone case made of iron? We guess that you have never ever seen such a thing.
Give it a try to guess the weight of the iron smartphone case.
We had two iron smartphone cases. The first one weighed 405g and the other one weighed 414g.

 

The picture shows the iron smartphone case stuck to iMARVEL. It didn’t fall off from iMARVEL once being stuck to it.
So it would be absolutely fine with iMARVEL no matter what kind of smartphones you use.
 

We have performed a variety of tests while producing iMARVEL and we are really happy to share the story behind the development of iMARVEL with you.
 

 

iMarvel was designed based on shapes and forms of different smartphones and its both ends were rounded to deliver the feelings of those paintings on it and we have done a series of tests in order to make iMarvel appropriate for all kinds of smartphones with different form factors.

<p><strong><em>EARLY HISTORY</em></strong>: I am a single mother who had a successful career when I was younger. During a difficult and painful divorce in which my boys and I were removed from the marital home, I discovered I had Degenerative Disc Disease. I had had the pain for years but attributed it to lifting toddlers, working, house work and yard work.  It was so extreme I was put on Social Security Disability.  There is also arthritis throughout the spine.  You can imagine that living off Social Security Disability and child support for years saving money was difficult. The worst thing was not being able to work; being able to better my situation. It drove me insane and still does. So on top of the pain, major anxiety and depression sunk in and still spikes due to my situation because I was and am helpless to fix the situation.</p>
<p><strong><em>The Move</em></strong><strong>:</strong> In July 2011 listening to doctor’s advice that I would be more comfortable and have the potential to be more active, I took what little saving I had and moved the boys and I to Florida. This was to be my new start. I thought that if the pain could be helped by the warmer weather that I could maybe even start a small part time job again and be able to provide a better life for my kids. At first it seemed better but there was no further relief even in the warmth and the humidity made me nauseous. Early this past summer my back became worse. I was terrified because I had nothing and the medical bills were burying us. This new pain was unbelievable and it was like no pain I had ever felt before. In general the pain is in my low back, hips and legs. This pain was higher up and was wreaking havoc with my digestive &amp; urinary track systems for which I will save you the details.  Just doing normal tasks was too much. Then one day I started to stop feeling my legs, I was weak and to the point that I needed help to walk. I ended up in the ER. The doctor’s performed an MRI and concluded there was new and increased bulging in a disc that only had a slight tear and slight bulge before. These symptoms are still present almost 5 months after the initial increase in pain.   </p>
<p><strong><em>As a Results</em></strong><strong>:</strong> What I thought would be a huge change for the better for my family and health turned the opposite. The best thing I can do now is move back to north to Massachusetts where I can receive the medical care I require and where I have a support system in place. I have no support system here.</p>
<p>Due to the illness of my parents my family is in no position to help me so I am asking for your help to save me and my sons.</p>
<p>I am asking for $2,000 (even though I need closer to $10,000 because I have NOTHING and will need to find a suitable place to live. I sold everything to move down here so I have virtually nothing such as beds, kitchen supplies etc. $2000 will barely cover the moving costs). The money will pay to get me back north where I can get the care I need and where I have a great support system. My doctors are in place.</p>
<p>I cannot stay here. The medical system is far more expensive and I have lost everything. I fear if I can’t get help I will be homeless within the year and I will lose my children, which would destroy the three of us. Every month I get deeper in debt even though we are on a strict budget. I can barely make it in a tiny furnished apartment with the basics. I can’t even think about being homeless and my children taken from me. Here I am alone. Medical fees and care are astronomical. My back will only worsen. I have hit a wall and need your help to get over it.</p>
<p>Please help me move back home and get the medical care and support I need. I may have to live with constant sometimes debilitating pain, but please help me do so with my friends and family who love me, and with my boys.</p></div>","The rest of my life in pain…my last hope

Please help me move back home and get the medical care and support I need. I may have to live with constant sometimes debilitating pain, but please help me do so with my friends and family who love me, and with my boys.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We are the Mumaws: Jordan and Jami.  We met in 2005 while working at a local pool as lifeguards and started dating in 2006 and loved every minute of it.  We have been happily married since July 24, 2010.  Jordan is an avid Lego and RC car fan who works with children on social and behavior skills.  I, Jami, am a knitter and a scrapbooker who is currently looking for a job in my field of Elementary Education. Jordan was adopted as a newborn from Bolivia and he always wanted a family that he could really call his own, that are blood relatives.  The above video is just a little clip of who we are so that you can see a little bit into our lives.  The dog at the end of the video is our adopted “baby” Colbi who is now 2 years old.  (The wedding pictures are the work of the wonderful Casi Leisure and Kelsey Campbell of Casi Leisure Photography.  Visit them at <a href=""http://casileisurephotography.com/."" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://casileisurephotography.com/.</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Our Surprise</strong></p>
<p>We knew before we got married that we wanted 4 children of our own and even had names picked out for our unborn children.  We decided to wait until I was done with school before we would start our family.  However, we were so anxious about being parents that we couldn’t wait and we started trying right before my last semester of college so that we would have a baby shortly after I graduated.  Eight months of no success later, we were worried that something was very wrong, so I went to the doctor.  We were diagnosed with unexplained infertility and shortly thereafter, I was diagnosed with hyperinsulinemia (pre-diabetes) and hypothyroidism, both of which affect our odds of conceiving.  We were absolutely stunned.  Almost every woman in my family was a “fertile Myrtle” so when we didn’t get pregnant right away, we had no idea what could be wrong and couldn’t believe that something could be.  Our odds weren’t looking very good so we consulted a fertility specialist who decided that intrauterine insemination would be our next step.  After that failed we were left with 3 options: in vitro fertilization, adoption and fostering.  While I had always dreamed of adopting one child from the same town that Jordan was adopted from in Bolivia, I never thought that our entire family would be the result of adoptions instead of biological children.  While we are considering all 3 avenues as possibilities, we have both agreed that we want to exhaust all options for us to have a biological child and have chosen to give IVF one shot. </p>
<p><strong>Our Problem</strong></p>
<p>IVF, while being our last shot at having our own children, comes with a hefty price tag.  We live in Indiana and insurance companies here are not required to cover assisted fertility.  We can’t even have the costs billed to our deductible.  So that leaves us with a large sum of money to come up with from a one-income household and to pay up front for the procedure. </p>
<p><strong>Our Goal</strong></p>
<p>Essentially, we need around $12,000 for the IVF procedure and another $3,000 for the medications that I would need to take.  However, $15,000 seems like an awful lot to ask from any group of people.  We are asking for around $2,000 in donations over the next 60 days to help us towards our goal of IVF.  This even seems like a lot to ask for.  So here is what you can do to help us…</p>
<p><strong>What You Can Do To Help Us</strong></p>
<p>If just 200 people are willing to donate only $10 we will have met our goal.  Even small contributions will mean the world to us.  So whether you can donate $1 or $100, we will thank you graciously and you will always be in our hearts as someone who supported our dream and helped us make it a reality.  If you are unable to donate, we understand, but if you still support our cause, share our story in whatever way you want to.  Feel free the share our story using the tools provided by IndieGoGo.  We are eternally grateful for any support we can receive.  Thank you so much for taking the time to read our story!</p></div>","About Us

<p>My name is Tami Zilka. I am a stay at home mom and have 2 beautiful girls, Zoey who is 3 and Sophie who is 3 months. Sophie was born April 26 2012 weighing 7.5lbs she seemed like a healthy newborn. She began having difficulty eating and after changing her formula several times we found one that she could use and thought our troubles were over. May 23rd Sophie made a horrible screeching sound and when I came into her room she was blue in her crib. I began stimulating Sophie and her color returned to normal. She was admitted to the hospital and weighed 6lbs. May 25, Sophie was transferred to Childrens Hospital in Minneapolis never in my dreams did I think we would spend a month in ICC at Childrens.</p>
<p>It was determined that Sophie was aspirating on her food and a feeding tube was surgically placed on June 6. June 8th she was diagnosed with Angelman Syndrome a rare genetic disorder that occurs in 1/15,000 live births often misdiagnosed as Cerebal Paulsy or Autisim.</p>
<p>Characteristics of Angelman Syndrome are seizure,developmental delay, balance and mobility issues, Autistic traits, little or no speech.More information about Angelman Syndrome can be found at <a href=""http://www.Angelmandfoundation.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.Angelmandfoundation.org</a></p>
<p>A service animal was recommended. The service animal will alert to seizure prior to it happening. The animal will also encourage development and mobility. We were lucky enough to find an organization who was willing to place a dog with Sophie. Huge thanks to 4Pawsforability! More information can be found at <a href=""http://www.4pawsforability.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.4pawsforability.org</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our fundraising requirement is $13,000 all proceeds will go towards the service animal. I am willing to take on this challenge to help my daughter reach her full potential. Every donation is greatly appreciated as we can not do this on our own. There are not enough words to express my grattitude for your support.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>A Benefit is being held Saturday October 13 at the VFW in Randall. There will be a Spaghetti dinner, bake sale, silent acution, Music provided by Power of Cheese. If you would like to donate towards dinner, bake sale or silent auction please feel free to contact us for more information. Once again I would like to thank everyone for their support in helping us get Sophie's service animal here as soon as possible!!</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">In February 2012, Trevor Murphy stepped in the Disc Golf world. Purchasing his first ""real"" set of discs from a local disc golf shop in Orlando Florida.

<p style=""margin-bottom: 0in;"">In May 2012, Trevor returned to the North Eastern Ohio / Western PA area and realized that Disc Golf was so much more. Playing relentlessly in his ""new"" home of Disc Golf, traveling to local courses, and playing in a winter points series, Trevor's passion for an organized Disc Golf Club grew. Realizing that newer players were the future of Disc Golf. He decided to start a Club that would bring New Players in with Seasoned Veterans of the game to help encourage the Growth of Disc Golf. With the help of Chuck Coristin, 1 year player, and Becky Caszatt, less than 1yr playing, a team that would help him achieve this goal.</p>

and the effects of gravity and our own body weight. Inversion alleviates
 muscle tension, neck &amp; back pain, promotes increased joint 
mobility, flexibility, relaxation and increased circulation of blood, 
lymph &amp; energy. It is an incredible anti-stress and anti-aging 
practice – we like to call it a “natural botox.”</p>
<p>The Yogena™ 
suspension system is an inversion sling that allows you to suspend in an
 inverted position with your pelvis and leg muscles bearing your body 
weight. This position eliminates all gravitational 
compression. Inversion therapy is the safest, quickest and most 
effective way to increase the space between your vertebrae. Numerous 
clinical studies published in reputable medical journals have 
confirmed that inversion really does increase the separation between 
the discs of the spine, which brings relief from back pain. <br/></p>

<p>Dancing Lotus Fitness started in 2009 with the simple goal of bringing fun and unique fitness classes that would be accessible to all ages and abilities, into our community. Meriah Jacobs-Frost began an initial offering of ZUMBA Fitness classes a few days a week, and in those first months the classes had one or two people attending. We stuck with our classes and after a few months we celebrated the glorious day that we had seven people in our classes!  Now after over two and a half years of hard work and dedication we regularly have more than 25 people in our classes--huge numbers for the area we serve! What Meriah initially intended to be a small hobby has now grown to a small business, offering 16 classes each week in three local communities. Dancing Lotus now sees about 100 individuals taking advantage of their mind-body fitness classes each month.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Dancing Lotus is committed to delivering a fun, motivating and effective class that anyone can enjoy--in a safe, relaxed atmosphere. These are classes that that people want to share with their friends and family. Dancing Lotus classes can become girl's night out, or even a family reunion. We sometimes have three generations in our classes! Our classes are all unique workouts that our participants look forward to. We now offer ZUMBA Fitness, PiYo, Yoga, and Hoop Dance classes. These classes are made more accessible than they might otherwise be by Meriah's dedication to education and training so that we can tailor each person's workout to what they need. Our overwhelming success comes from our passion for what we do. We love our participants and the way our classes affect their lives. People feel like part of the Dancing Lotus ""family"" rather than members of a gym. Through our commitment to education and providing fun yet effective classes, we make wellness an integral part of people's lives.</p>

<p>The Dancing Lotus Fitness Studio will allow us to take the mission of providing Fun and Unique Fitness to the next level. We currently rent space in multiple locations with less than ideal conditions and restrictions on space and scheduling. The Studio will allow us to create a schedule that better suits the needs of our participants and ensure that we provide a safe environment for our classes. To make the most out of our classes, we need to have sufficient open space, appropriate flooring, and proper heating and air conditioning. Finally, the studio will also allow Dancing Lotus to expand our offerings to include programming that will positively impact wellness in other areas of our participants lives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The success of our studio will help us to continue to promote and increase wellness in the community. In the first two months of 2012 our participants have lost over 120 pounds through our free weight loss support! We love hearing stories of people going to their health care providers and being told to keep up whatever it is they're doing that has their test results coming back with such marked improvement (That would be their Dancing Lotus Fitness classes and healthier eating!)! Dancing Lotus is designed to do even more than just make people's bodies healthier.  Our classes also work to make our participants feel empowered, strong, and increase a positive self image. They give individuals the opportunity to express themselves through creative movement as their bodies get stronger! The studio will mean increased health and happiness for the communities we serve.</p>

While the business has seen incredible success, it is still a small, family-owned operation. The backing of the community and individuals who support the vision of wellness for everyone can help take us to the next level. We need approximately $12,000 towards the down payment for our own building. We have set our minimum goal here to allow us to at least secure the space for the studio. We know that we will need an additional $5,000 to make the critical improvements and purchases to get classes up and running (namely flooring and equipment such as yoga mats). We wold love to exceed this minimum goal and be able to open the studio even sooner.</p>
<p>In exchange for your assistance with opening the Dancing Lotus studio, we are offering a number of unique incentives! Choose from everything between a simple thank you and acknowledgment to an exclusive behind-the-scenes opening, to a private fitness party! Not from the area, or maybe you'd rather donate your incentive? If you choose, we will set aside classes for those who may not otherwise be able to afford them in lieu of the listed perk. Donors will also be acknowledged in various ways, from on our website to an eventual permanent installation in the studio. (If you choose to remain anonymous in your donation we will, of course, honor your wishes!)</p>

<p>NEW 3/26/2012! We are so excited to be adding <strong>Hoopnotica Travel Hoops and DVDs</strong> to the available perks. These are now available thanks to a very generous donation by Hoopnotica! We are so grateful for their support in making this dream come true. Choose from one of the wonderful Hoopnotica DVDs or a Hoopnotica Travel Hoop! Hoopnotica is the format we teach at Dancing Lotus Fitness, and we highly recommend both the DVDs and Travel Hoops!</p>

<p>If the funding goal is reached and we are unable to purchase a building, or if we do not reach the full amount we need to purchase a building, the money will be held in a savings account until we are able to successfully find an appropriate space and move forward with the purchase (or possible lease) of a studio space. If we are in a situation where we need to lease, the money collected will be used to defer our startup expenses and assist us in transitioning into the new space. In either case, we will appreciate everyone's patience with the incentives that involve the studio itself. Should we exceed our goal, the excess will go towards the aforementioned necessary improvements. Any additional funds raised would assist us with additional improvements and the basic operating expenses in kickstarting the studio.</p>

Dancing Lotus now sees about 100 individuals taking advantage of their mind-body fitness classes each month.
 
Dancing Lotus is committed to delivering a fun, motivating and effective class that anyone can enjoy--in a safe, relaxed atmosphere. These are classes that that people want to share with their friends and family. Dancing Lotus classes can become girl's night out, or even a family reunion. We sometimes have three generations in our classes! Our classes are all unique workouts that our participants look forward to. We now offer ZUMBA Fitness, PiYo, Yoga, and Hoop Dance classes. These classes are made more accessible than they might otherwise be by Meriah's dedication to education and training so that we can tailor each person's workout to what they need. Our overwhelming success comes from our passion for what we do. We love our participants and the way our classes affect their lives. People feel like part of the Dancing Lotus ""family"" rather than members of a gym. Through our commitment to education and providing fun yet effective classes, we make wellness an integral part of people's lives.
 


The Impact of the Dancing Lotus Fitness Studio
The Dancing Lotus Fitness Studio will allow us to take the mission of providing Fun and Unique Fitness to the next level. We currently rent space in multiple locations with less than ideal conditions and restrictions on space and scheduling. The Studio will allow us to create a schedule that better suits the needs of our participants and ensure that we provide a safe environment for our classes. To make the most out of our classes, we need to have sufficient open space, appropriate flooring, and proper heating and air conditioning. Finally, the studio will also allow Dancing Lotus to expand our offerings to include programming that will positively impact wellness in other areas of our participants lives.
 
The success of our studio will help us to continue to promote and increase wellness in the community. In the first two months of 2012 our participants have lost over 120 pounds through our free weight loss support! We love hearing stories of people going to their health care providers and being told to keep up whatever it is they're doing that has their test results coming back with such marked improvement (That would be their Dancing Lotus Fitness classes and healthier eating!)! Dancing Lotus is designed to do even more than just make people's bodies healthier.  Our classes also work to make our participants feel empowered, strong, and increase a positive self image. They give individuals the opportunity to express themselves through creative movement as their bodies get stronger! The studio will mean increased health and happiness for the communities we serve.
 


What We Need & What You Get
The Dancing Lotus Studio needs Grassroots support to get up and running. While the business has seen incredible success, it is still a small, family-owned operation. The backing of the community and individuals who support the vision of wellness for everyone can help take us to the next level. We need approximately $12,000 towards the down payment for our own building. We have set our minimum goal here to allow us to at least secure the space for the studio. We know that we will need an additional $5,000 to make the critical improvements and purchases to get classes up and running (namely flooring and equipment such as yoga mats). We wold love to exceed this minimum goal and be able to open the studio even sooner.
In exchange for your assistance with opening the Dancing Lotus studio, we are offering a number of unique incentives! Choose from everything between a simple thank you and acknowledgment to an exclusive behind-the-scenes opening, to a private fitness party! Not from the area, or maybe you'd rather donate your incentive? If you choose, we will set aside classes for those who may not otherwise be able to afford them in lieu of the listed perk. Donors will also be acknowledged in various ways, from on our website to an eventual permanent installation in the studio. (If you choose to remain anonymous in your donation we will, of course, honor your wishes!)
SOLD OUT--Hoop Mamas Exclusive Hoop Package!
NEW 3/26/2012! We are so excited to be adding Hoopnotica Travel Hoops and DVDs to the available perks. These are now available thanks to a very generous donation by Hoopnotica! We are so grateful for their support in making this dream come true. Choose from one of the wonderful Hoopnotica DVDs or a Hoopnotica Travel Hoop! Hoopnotica is the format we teach at Dancing Lotus Fitness, and we highly recommend both the DVDs and Travel Hoops!

If the funding goal is reached and we are unable to purchase a building, or if we do not reach the full amount we need to purchase a building, the money will be held in a savings account until we are able to successfully find an appropriate space and move forward with the purchase (or possible lease) of a studio space. If we are in a situation where we need to lease, the money collected will be used to defer our startup expenses and assist us in transitioning into the new space. In either case, we will appreciate everyone's patience with the incentives that involve the studio itself. Should we exceed our goal, the excess will go towards the aforementioned necessary improvements. Any additional funds raised would assist us with additional improvements and the basic operating expenses in kickstarting the studio.
