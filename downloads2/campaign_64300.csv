<strong>Alfred Lagaya</strong> - Co-Founder<br/> Scientist Solutions Events<br/><br/><div style=""text-align: justify;"">I was a scientist at AxyS Pharmaceuticals in La Jolla, CA where our research revolved around high-throughput, genetic disease study programs such as Diabetes, Asthma, Schizophrenia, and Osteoporosis, prior to joining a sales team selling disposables for HTS and other science applications. Marcia and I were disturbed seeing reps walking into labs and invading scientists’ privacy. As reps ourselves, we were extremely uncomfortable walking into scientists personal bench spaces. We realized scientists needed access to technology and products but wanted to completely change the process of selling into labs. We started putting on vendor shows in 1998 with about two dozen vendor friends to get the lab doors closed, while improving the efficiency of the flow of information to scientists. About five years later we formerly incorporated BioTech Solutions. Today the company is called Scientist Solutions Events. We hope you have enjoyed less interruption of your experiments. Please let us know if you would like us to host an event at your Institution.</div>

<strong>Fraser Moss</strong> - President<br/> Scientist Solutions, Inc.<br/><br/> I am Fraser Moss, President of ScientistSolutions.com and also known as TheFFM on the site. I have a Ph. D. in Pharmacology from University College London and postdoc experience at the California Institute of Technology and Case Western Reserve University as well as spending some time in industry. My research has focused predominantly on neuronal ion channel and neurotransmitter transporter biophysics. I have extensive training in electrophysiology, fluorescence imaging, molecular biology and protein biochemistry and have employed these techniques to investigate the oligomerization, stoichiometry, trafficking and pharmacology of these elegant multimeric proteins in both normal and disease states. Before I became a moderator and then President of the site, I found ScientistSolutions.com in 2005 while looking for information on the web to troubleshoot a problem with my research. I've been logged on ever since.  <br/><br/> I quickly recognized the site’s power to allow quick interaction with peers from all over the world to help obtain the information I needed. I have gained a great deal of satisfaction sharing my own knowledge and experience on the site. I hope to continue to help my fellow scientists through ScientistSolutions.com for many more years and see the site become the first port of call for life-scientists worldwide when they turn on their web browsers.</td>

Besides cell wall research, I’m interested in a wide range of topics in biosciences and I hope this multidisciplinary interest and the depth of my training will help me to be an independent researcher in the future. In the summer of 2009, a colleague introduced me to SSI and I started contributing soon after that. After less than one year stint as a regular contributor to the SSI forums, I was asked to join the moderators’ team, which I gladly accepted. I hope this way I can give back the scientific community some of the knowledge I have received over the years.</td>

Hence I started actively posting my tips and thoughts. In the spring of 2010, I gratefully accepted an invitation to join the team of Scientist Solutions' moderators.

<strong>Ginny Pearce<br/></strong>Moderator of <em>Mitochondria Research<br/><br/></em>My overall research centers on human gender specific stem cell renewal with the objective of advancing the understanding and treatment of disease and injury. Adult stem cells are capable of renewing themselves, and/or generating multiple cell types during normal growth and repair. However, these capabilities can also play a role in diseased states that are associated with inflammatory response/stress and cancer. To harness and take advantage of renewal capabilities, my research focuses on two areas (1) optimization and characterization of adult stem cell cultures for renewal and selection of cell subtypes, and (2) identification and subcellular localization of certain mitochondrial associated proteins that mediate stem cell renewal/survival. The types of adult stem cells used in these studies include human neural stem cells derived from fetal tissue and mammary epithelial stem cells. Proteins of interest studied include stem cell markers for identification of cell types, and mitochondrial associated proteins survivin, p53, cytochrome c, TOM20, nuclear receptors, and hTERT for renewal. My research efforts are aimed at determining subtypes and their associated proteins as potential targets for pharmacological mediation of stem cell renewal. I am fortunate to collaborate with both institutional and industry sources to develop and culture gender specific stems cell lines.</td>

1. Participate and help your favorite lab or institution win a $5,000 grant (for their lab) or a $20,000 grant (for their institution). Be sure to mention the name of your favorite lab or institution after you contribute. Here's how: After you make your contribution here on Indiegogo, you'll receive an email within 24 hours from Scientist Solutions. Open that email and click on the name of your favorite Lab or Institution to help them win these grants. If we meet our funding goal, then whoever gets the most name mentions wins! (The winners will be determined by the number of contributions, not the amount of money donated.  Even $1 donations can help you win! In the event of a tie, the winner will be determined by the total amount donated in the name of your favorite Lab or Institution.)




2. Who's in the Lead to Win our $5,000-$20,000 Grants?Baylor College of Medicine - Wensel Lab Case Western Reserve - Boron Lab Rice - Beth Beason Lab Texas A & M UCSD,  UCSF - Marcus Muench Lab University of Georgia - William S. York Lab University of Washington Seattle - Ram Sarvar Lab University of Wisconsin Madison - Zinnen Lab University of Delhi - Cancer Proteomics Research Lab




3. Cool Perks:




4. How Scientist Solutions Helps Scientists  Find Cures for Disease Faster:Scientist Solutions is a collaborative website. It's like Wikipedia in the amount of scientific information it houses, and it's like Facebook in how Scientists can interact and collaborate on our Forums. We help accelerate the pace of scientific discovery by enabling scientists around the world to collaborate online in real time, all for free.  This helps scientists find cures for diseases faster and save millions of lives.(CLICK HERE to Watch a video  about how scientific collaboration helped contain SARS before it became a worldwide epidemic 
We are one of the largest Life Science collaboration websites in the world.  Over the past 3 years we have been studied by a National Science Foundation grant recipient as one of the two best sites for scientists on the Internet. On our own we have bootstrapped and been able to grow the company to the point of reaching 1 million scientists a year. And we have advanced science thousands of times. But it’s not enough.  With an estimated 12-15 million life science researchers worldwide we are just scratching the surface.  With your help, we will connect 100% of the world's Life Scientists and cause an explosion of scientific discovery that can literally change our planet. 




5. Where in the World Are Our Scientists?Scientists from 163 countries collaborate on our website  to find cures for disease faster




6. Why the World Needs Scientist Solutions:  Life science researchers spend hours each week looking for products, protocols (recipes for experiments) and information. When a scientist/researcher gets “stuck “or has a challenge with their experiment, they can post a question on one of our moderated forums and often within hours they will have solutions posted from other scientists around the world. Because our forums are moderated by scientists, the answers to posted questions aren’t just crazy ideas posted by anyone, they are well-thought out and reality-based scientific answers that help move a scientist’s research forward.  Each question answered can save a scientist one month, two months, or even six months in their experiment. Take 1 million scientists and add up the time savings and you can begin to see how we are helping to accelerate the pace of scientific discovery and finding cures for disease.  NOW WE WANT TO REACH ALL 15 MILLION LIFE SCIENTISTS. BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP. MORE COLLABORATION = FASTER CURES These are all the areas of life science we help solve problems in.





7. A small segment of the Clients and Institutions we serve, publications we have been mentioned in and organizations we give back to.



8. Use of Funds How we will spend the money we raise:1. Website Development: We desperately need to overhaul the code of our website. After we re-code our website to make it stable and strong, we'll be poised to connect all 15 Million Life Scientists of the world.  $4500/month for 24 months = $108,0002. Staffing: We're so grateful to all our moderators who have generously donated their time to forward scientific collaboration on our site. It's about time they got paid what they're worth!We'll use Indiegogo funds to pay our awesome staff:Stipends for Moderators: $200/month (24 months) for 26 moderators = $124,8002 Support Staff (12 months) = 2 Support Staff at $3200/month x 12 months = $38,400 Our goal is $270,000. But we'll let you in on a little secret: our real goal is to raise $1 Million through this Indiegogo campaign (April 15 - June 14, 2013)! If we raise way more than our Indiegogo goal, we have even more plans. We will dedicate the proceeds to populating our GATCAT.com Site (patent pending) with product reviews and work towards the goal of aggregating the world’s millions of life science products from over 600 suppliers (all our customers) in one convenient place so scientists won’t have to search and research so many sites when they are designing their experiments. Additionally we would hire additional support staff for our Events Division of ScientistSolutionsEvents.com where we connect our 600 supplier clients to scientists on site at their institutions so the two may have regular contact on the latest and most innovative products.  Please help us blow our goal out of the water so we can do everything we're dreaming of to help the Life Scientists of the World!


9. About UsScientist Solutions is a majority woman owned company dedicated to life science advocacy worldwide.Scientist Solutions Inc. was started in 2004 for the purpose of promoting the worldwide advancement of science and biotechnology. To achieve this goal we have developed an internet discussion site or ""Board"" to provide scientists a resource for the exchange of ideas and information.






A Note from Marcia (Founder of Scientist Solutions)The inspiration for Scientist Solutions came from two places:   I saw the power of E-Bay many years ago to connect people:  What one person sees as trash is treasure to someone else.   While working with Southern BioTech, I saw scientists struggling every day to find antibodies.  Back then producing a monoclonal antibody was a 9 month process and the result wasn't guaranteed.  I saw my boss, Charles Lichtman, the CEO connecting scientists from one lab to another to share antibodies.  With the emergence of the Internet I felt there needed to be a hub for scientists to connect and share information, problem solve and even collaborate. For instance, if one scientist in China shares an antibody from his or her freezer with a scientist in California, that can potentially save several months in an experiment.


Marcia Allen



If we improve efficiencies throughout all aspects of research, we can accelerate life science, finding cures years earlier. Help us connect every scientist in the world and together we can change the world. Thank you!






 
 


Meet the Scientist Solutions Team


 
 



Welcome from Scientist Solutions' Team Leaders






 
 




Alfred Lagaya - Co-Founder Scientist Solutions EventsI was a scientist at AxyS Pharmaceuticals in La Jolla, CA where our research revolved around high-throughput, genetic disease study programs such as Diabetes, Asthma, Schizophrenia, and Osteoporosis, prior to joining a sales team selling disposables for HTS and other science applications. Marcia and I were disturbed seeing reps walking into labs and invading scientists’ privacy. As reps ourselves, we were extremely uncomfortable walking into scientists personal bench spaces. We realized scientists needed access to technology and products but wanted to completely change the process of selling into labs. We started putting on vendor shows in 1998 with about two dozen vendor friends to get the lab doors closed, while improving the efficiency of the flow of information to scientists. About five years later we formerly incorporated BioTech Solutions. Today the company is called Scientist Solutions Events. We hope you have enjoyed less interruption of your experiments. Please let us know if you would like us to host an event at your Institution.








David Klein - Chief Executive Officer, Scientist Solutions, Inc., Scientist Solutions Events & GATCAT
David Klein joined Scientist Solutions after a 25 year career in the Technology Sector of the Silicon Valley.After working for or with companies like HP, Siebel Systems, Microsoft, Intel and Legend (now Lenovo), he was intrigued by what we are doing here at Scientist Solutions.  
 “Having a brother with ALS and knowing there is very little funding for this terrible disease makes me passionate to help scientists in their quest for discovery and cures.  I hope to use my experience in technology, both with prominent companies and successful growth of my own start up to propel the Scientist Solutions organization and family to make a difference in life science""

Jason King- Edinburgh University College of Medicine & Veterinary Medicine
Moderator of VirologyI have been a postdoc at Edinburgh University's College of Medicine & Veterinary Medicine since 2001. My work here has involved using cloning and producing recombinant AAV, Adenovirus and lentiviruses to overexpress or knockdown gene expression to better understand mechanisms involved in inflammation and cancer and very recently,  human ES cell work. I stumbled upon Scientist Solutions just as I was beginning a new project and was happy to find such a friendly community that was always keen to point fellow scientists in the right direction. I found that this matched my (Scouting) scientist values and so now I'm ""doing a good turn every day"" - well almost.

Sami Tuomivaara - Moderator of Protein Chemistry & BioinformaticsI’m currently pursuing a PhD degree in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. My dissertation work focuses on the structure and function of plant cell wall, a topic which I find intellectually extremely challenging. Besides cell wall research, I’m interested in a wide range of topics in biosciences and I hope this multidisciplinary interest and the depth of my training will help me to be an independent researcher in the future. In the summer of 2009, a colleague introduced me to SSI and I started contributing soon after that. After less than one year stint as a regular contributor to the SSI forums, I was asked to join the moderators’ team, which I gladly accepted. I hope this way I can give back the scientific community some of the knowledge I have received over the years.

Chin Fen Teo   Moderator of Protein Chemistry & Glycobiology

I am currently pursuing my PhD degree in Biochemistry, focusing on the impact of glycosylation on cell signaling. I stumbled across Scientist Solutions one summer evening of 2009 while searching for a “second opinion” regarding one of the experiments I was working on. Having read some of the threads on the forum, I realized that I could also contribute and help others to overcome their problems similar to mine, which I spent days or weeks or even months figuring out by myself. Hence I started actively posting my tips and thoughts. In the spring of 2010, I gratefully accepted an invitation to join the team of Scientist Solutions' moderators. I hope that as a moderator, I can continue helping others in the true spirit of science.

Ginny PearceModerator of Mitochondria ResearchMy overall research centers on human gender specific stem cell renewal with the objective of advancing the understanding and treatment of disease and injury. Adult stem cells are capable of renewing themselves, and/or generating multiple cell types during normal growth and repair. However, these capabilities can also play a role in diseased states that are associated with inflammatory response/stress and cancer. To harness and take advantage of renewal capabilities, my research focuses on two areas (1) optimization and characterization of adult stem cell cultures for renewal and selection of cell subtypes, and (2) identification and subcellular localization of certain mitochondrial associated proteins that mediate stem cell renewal/survival. The types of adult stem cells used in these studies include human neural stem cells derived from fetal tissue and mammary epithelial stem cells. Proteins of interest studied include stem cell markers for identification of cell types, and mitochondrial associated proteins survivin, p53, cytochrome c, TOM20, nuclear receptors, and hTERT for renewal. My research efforts are aimed at determining subtypes and their associated proteins as potential targets for pharmacological mediation of stem cell renewal. I am fortunate to collaborate with both institutional and industry sources to develop and culture gender specific stems cell lines.

<h2><strong><em style=""font-size: 10px;"">Bemelsa needs a new kitchen! We serve two hot meals every day to over 200 people, and it really takes its toll on our facilities. After being an essential part of our community as such for 30 years, we have a lot of work to do!</em></strong></h2>
<p>Bemelsa is short for Beata Melchorita Saravia, a woman who dedicated her life to feeding the people and bettering the community of Grocio Prado, and is now a sort of patron saint of the pueblo. We are a non-profit <em>comedor</em>, or dining hall, in Grocio Prado, Peru.</p>
<p>Over 200 children, disabled adults, and the elderly come to enjoy a hot meal two times a day. We’ve been in operation for over 30 years, and in the last 5 have added programs involving educational and social support. </p>
<p>Everyone who comes to eat at the Comedor really needs the food we offer them - financially, they wouldn't be able to provide it for themselves. Furthermore, many of the kids come from a background of broken families, domestic abuse, and a family history of deliquency. The Comedor is a safe space whose programs give the youth of Grocio Prado a fighting chance to break out of the cycle of poverty into which they were born. As a local grassroots NGO, we rely almost completely on charitable donors, and we sincerely hope that you’ll join our family as one of them! </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Our Situation</strong></h2>
<p>Serving two hot meals to over 200 people every day takes its toll on our facilities. That's 400 meals a day, which is 2000 meals a week and a staggering 104,000 meals a year! Multiply that by 30 and it's not so hard to see why we're in such dire need of renovation. </p>
<p>In order to keep the Comedor alive and in ship-shape, we need to do a complete overhaul on the kitchen. This includes a new industrial refrigerator and stove-top, all new dishes and serving utencils, cutlery and crockery. In total, our expenses for these purchases will run to 10,100 nuevos soles, or around $3950 USD. The extra $350 USD in our goal is to account for travel to and  Lima (the capital) and back to make the purchases, cleaning supplies to help with the overhaul and the percentage that Indiegogo will take.</p>
<p>The following list is a breakdown of EXACTLY what we need:</p>

<p> </p></div>","Extreme Comedor Makeover! 
Bemelsa needs a new kitchen! We serve two hot meals every day to over 200 people, and it really takes its toll on our facilities. After being an essential part of our community as such for 30 years, we have a lot of work to do!
Bemelsa is short for Beata Melchorita Saravia, a woman who dedicated her life to feeding the people and bettering the community of Grocio Prado, and is now a sort of patron saint of the pueblo. We are a non-profit comedor, or dining hall, in Grocio Prado, Peru.
Over 200 children, disabled adults, and the elderly come to enjoy a hot meal two times a day. We’ve been in operation for over 30 years, and in the last 5 have added programs involving educational and social support. 
Everyone who comes to eat at the Comedor really needs the food we offer them - financially, they wouldn't be able to provide it for themselves. Furthermore, many of the kids come from a background of broken families, domestic abuse, and a family history of deliquency. The Comedor is a safe space whose programs give the youth of Grocio Prado a fighting chance to break out of the cycle of poverty into which they were born. As a local grassroots NGO, we rely almost completely on charitable donors, and we sincerely hope that you’ll join our family as one of them! 
 
Our Situation
Serving two hot meals to over 200 people every day takes its toll on our facilities. That's 400 meals a day, which is 2000 meals a week and a staggering 104,000 meals a year! Multiply that by 30 and it's not so hard to see why we're in such dire need of renovation. 
In order to keep the Comedor alive and in ship-shape, we need to do a complete overhaul on the kitchen. This includes a new industrial refrigerator and stove-top, all new dishes and serving utencils, cutlery and crockery. In total, our expenses for these purchases will run to 10,100 nuevos soles, or around $3950 USD. The extra $350 USD in our goal is to account for travel to and  Lima (the capital) and back to make the purchases, cleaning supplies to help with the overhaul and the percentage that Indiegogo will take.

<p>When it comes right down to it the most important part of scoring low in golf is being an excellent putter. Since most golfers, professionals included, move their head when they putt, their putting scores will be erratic. The O'Beam is a simple training aid - it provides immediate feedback about head movement, allowing golfers to correct the problem, which reduces putts and lowers their score.</p>
<p><img align=""right"" alt=""O'BEAM Putting Aid, Clipped on Visor"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.obeamputt.com/images/photo-ClippedOnVisor.jpg"" hspace=""10"" src="""" style=""""/>The O'Beam started as a simple way to show my friend and student how much he was moving his head when putting. No matter what I did he still could not believe he was moving his head. I decided I needed to come up with something that will show him immediately how much his head was truly moving. I designed a laser to affix to the bill of a visor or hat that emits an ""O"" on the ball. After his very first stroke he was absolutely shocked; he worked with this device for a few days and before he knew it he was dropping putts and his scores started to drop dramatically.</p>
<p><img align=""right"" alt=""O'BEAM Putting Aid, Laser O on Ball"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.obeamputt.com/images/photo-LaserOnBall.jpg"" hspace=""10"" src="""" style=""""/>He was so impressed as well as all of those who watched him practice with it, I was suddenly bombarded with demands for more units. I immediately realized that I needed to get more units, a patent, a logo, several made to meet the demand and I did. Before I knew it I ran into Chip Beck, Champions Tour Player, and he was mesmerized by the O’Beam. He asked for one and wanted to be the endorsing professional. While meeting with Chip Beck, several other Champions Tour Players were trying the O'Beam and were placing orders! Next, I was invited on to the Golf Channel for the Champions Tour Learning Channel to introduce the O'Beam.</p>

However, we have been able to overcome every challenge so far except generating enough money to provide this wonderful little device with the exposure it deserves to realize its full potential. There is no doubt that even the best products in the world need the proper exposure to be successful. There have been several marketing companies interested in marketing the O'Beam; however there is a large expense to marketing a product. That is why my biggest challenge is to generate funds to underwrite the marketing expenses. The O'Beam is an excellent product and the beauty is that we already know it is a success! The O'Beam sells itself from the website without adveritising, but even the best products in the world need the proper exposure.</p>

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p><strong>A GolfConversations.com Interview with Katie O'Keefe, CEO O'BEAM</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. In a nutshell, what's an O'BEAM?</strong></p>
<p>The O'Beam is a laser-guide putting aid that you attach to the bill of your hat. It emits a laser in the shape of an ""O"". When addressing the golf ball in your putting setup, you adjust the laser to have the ""O"" on the center of the golf ball. When you make your putting stroke, the O'Beam will instantly show you how much you are moving your head.</p>
<p><strong>2. How and when did you come up with the idea for OB?</strong></p>
<p>One of my students, Brian Callahan, who is now my business partner, could not keep his head still while putting, which resulted in high golf scores. He was frustrated because he could not recognize when and how much his head was moving. The only thing that I could think of was to attach a laser to his hat. There was no big plan and it was no more than a simple thought at the time.</p>
<p><strong>3. What did your friends/family think when you told them about OB?</strong></p>
<p>I didn't really tell anyone at first because it was just a simple aid to help my student. But when I realized how effective it was and how much it helped Brian, I thought some of my other students might benefit from it. I began to investigate what the next step would be to get O'BEAMs made. I told my family; however, they really didn't understand and I think they figured it would be just a passing interest and fizzle away. When I told my two best friends, though, Paige Phillips and Trish Wodatch, they both responded very nicely. Both were excited and felt that if anyone could make it happen, I could. Of course Brian was wonderful and very excited; he became my business partner in the venture.</p>
<p><strong>4. You're a golf instructor, not an inventor; what kind of research did you do to learn about laser beams?</strong></p>
<p>I read everything I could, via books and the Internet, about how lasers work.</p>
<p><strong>5. I assume you had to have a person or company with some laser beam ""aptitude"" to help you develop a prototype, yes?</strong></p>
<p>Actually, when I first got started, I had not yet even told Brian about it so I had no money to hire anyone to help me. I did all the research myself and created the first prototype on my own. I hired an engineer only after Brian used my very first prototype. Since I already had all the research completed, I just needed an engineer to put all my information into proper ""engineering terminology"" and do the CAD (computer-aided design) pictures.</p>
<p><strong>6. Did you go through several prototypes before you found the one you wanted? What was that experience like?</strong></p>
<p>No, I really knew from the start exactly what I wanted and the engineer copied my drawings almost to the letter. There was a slight change in shape because the batteries would not fit correctly into the shell of my original design. The clip I wanted was created so that the unit can rotate up and down to accommodate all setups. The only difficult thing for me was communicating with the engineers. Both were wonderful and very helpful. However, I learned in a hurry that you cannot ask an engineer a yes/no question. I wanted the laser to be in the shape of an ""O"" for two reasons: The golf ball is round and an ""O"" would be more visible, and because my last name is O'Keefe. The engineers told me this could not be done, that a laser, if magnified, looks like an asterisk, so there would be no way to make the ""O"" unless we used a screen on the lens that would make an ""O"". However, I knew this would minimize the strength of the laser thus making it difficult to see outside. So the long and the short of it was that I told the engineer to change how the laser sends its energy so that the shape is an ""O"" rather than *.</p>
<p><strong>7. What specifically were you looking for in the final prototype?</strong></p>
<p>Exactly what I wanted: a small, light unit with the laser in the shape of an ""O"" and a clip that rotates up and down.</p>
<p><strong>8. After your prototype was created, did you use it with students? Touring pros? What was their reaction to the OB?</strong></p>
<p>The first tour professional that I talked about it with was Tom Watson. I had contacted Mr. Watson about a friend whom has ALS, hoping that he might reach out to my friend and possibly give him some encouragement, which he did without hesitation. When Tom Watson was speaking with my friend on the phone, my friend told Tom Watson about my idea. Tom Watson then contacted me to ask me about it. I explained the concept and he thought it was a solid idea and wanted to see one when I had a final product. I was encouraged, thinking that if Tom Watson likes this idea, then it might be more successful then I had first anticipated. He put me in touch with Chip Beck. I called Chip; we set up an appointment to meet at a Champions Tour event being held in my town, Palm Coast. We met; he tried it, instantly loved it and was truly excited. He wanted one right then, but it was my original prototype so he had to wait for the first production run.</p>
<p><strong>9. What convinced you to go from the prototype stage to full production of the OB? What year did this occur?</strong></p>
<p>I don't think it ever occurred to me not to. I knew it worked and I know enough about the golf swing and the golf business that I knew people would want to use it. I started fooling around with the idea in February 2007 and it took about a year of research to apply for a patent and trademark. I was then in a patent-pending stage and we were off and running. After about a year and a half, I was invited to appear on Golf Channel.</p>
<p><strong>10.How many O'BEAMs were produced in the first run?</strong></p>
<p>1000</p>
<p><strong>11.Ok, you've got all these O'BEAMs produced; how did you go about trying to market them?</strong></p>
<p>We set up a Web site, <a href=""http://www.obeamputt.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.obeamputt.com</a>, and had a Google Adwords account using key words that drove traffic to the site. I was also fortunate to have been invited on the Champions Tour Learning Center on Golf Channel. This was a wonderful opportunity for me to introduce the O'Beam on television, and momentum started picking up.</p>
<p><strong>12. Chip Beck has endorsed OB; how did you meet Chip and how did you introduce him to the OB?</strong></p>
<p>Tom Watson put me in touch with Chip Beck. I called Chip; we set up an appointment to meet at a Champions Tour event being held in my town, Palm Coast. We met; he tried it, instantly loved it and was truly excited. He wanted one right then, but it was my original prototype so he had to wait for the first production run.</p>
<p><strong>13. What was Chip's reaction the first time he used OB?</strong></p>
<p>He was amazed by how simple the concept was and how much it helped him. He was excited to see that it provides immediate feedback so that you can correct yourself right away. ""Limited mobility of the head – so important in putting. This product is a must have for all golfers!"" he said. He immediately became my endorsing professional. I am so pleased and feel fortunate to have such a wonderful human being as an endorsing professional.</p>
<p><strong>14. Have any other touring pros used (not necessarily endorsed) OB?</strong></p>
<p>Bruce Fleisher tried it at the Champions Tour event in San Antonio, when we did the Golf Channel spot. He used it on the putting green and immediately loved it. He was so excited, and his energy and Chip's energy carried over to many other players. Bruce used it in his hotel room and the next day he had, I believe 24 putts, low putting round of the day and he had his first top-five finish in several years. Mike Goodes used one, and shortly after I gave him one, he had his first professional victory on the Champions Tour.</p>
<p><strong>15. What's been the reaction of your students to OB?</strong></p>
<p>They love it and want to know why I didn't come up with this idea sooner!</p>
<p><strong>16. Is OB safe? </strong></p>
<p>Can it burn your skin or burn grass or carpeting? Yes, it is safe. It is within the guidelines of the government.</p>
<p><strong>17. How many batteries does OB require?</strong></p>
<p>Three small ""nickel"" shaped batteries.</p>
<p><strong>18. OB is designed to help you keep your head still while putting, but can it also be used for the full swing and chipping &amp; pitching?</strong></p>
<p>Gary Halberg liked the O'BEAM for his full swing. I very much like the O'BEAM for pitching and chipping as well, and many of my students are using it for that and finding great success.</p>
<p><strong>19. Have you seen improvement in your students who use OB?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, dramatic improvement in their putting scores, drastically lowering their golf score. It is difficult to explain to students how putting is the most important part of the game of golf. The quickest way to lower your golf score is to eliminate putting strokes. Everyone tries to hit farther with their driver rather than just practicing putting and eliminating excessive putts. This is why the O'BEAM has been so successful: When a player's putting improves, his total golf score drops!</p>
<p><strong>20. While we're talking about putting and keeping your head still, is there a particular putting theory to which you subscribe? Straight back-straight-through? Inside-square-inside?</strong></p>
<p>I believe that we are all built differently and stroke the putter differently. However, I believe that no matter how you make your putting stroke, it is imperative for the club face to be square at impact and your head still.</p>
<p><strong>21. Who, in your opinion, are golf's top-3 putters?</strong></p>
<p>Seve Ballasteros had to be the best ever, in my opinion. He rarely hit a green or fairway in regulation but was able to get up-and-down better than anyone in the history of the game, which equates to a lot of one putts. He holds five major titles.</p>
<p>Second would have to be Ben Crenshaw. He always had perfect speed on the ball and it would just die into the hole as if it had eyes.</p>
<p>Jack Nicklaus would be third, in my opinion. Just watch the 1986 Masters and you will see for yourself. As a matter of fact, Ballesteros, Crenshaw and Nicklaus all won at Augusta National, in my opinion the toughest test of putting of any course.</p>
<p><strong>22. Can you recommend any books/DVDs that would work well in conjunction with O'BEAM? </strong></p>
<p>The O'BEAM is so simple to use and provides such instant feedback that it really doesn't need a supplement.</p>
<p><strong>23. Do you have any recommendations as to how long you should practice your putting? (x% full swing, x% putting, x% chipping, etc.)</strong></p>
<p>35% putting, 35% short game, 30% swing.</p>
<p><strong>24. Why is it so difficult to keep your head still while putting?</strong></p>
<p>I think there is a natural instinct to want to see where the ball is going. I tell my students all the time, if you lose a ball on the putting green you should probably be looking for another sport to play. There is no need to look for the ball, but instinctively we all do at some point. Also, many people can't recognize when and how much they are moving, which is what makes the O'BEAM so unique. It gives instant feedback. I can actually read my students' faces, as if a light bulb has gone on when they see how much the O'BEAM has moved. Instantly they begin to train themselves to minimize their head movement.</p>
<p><strong>25. Jimmy Ballard says it's all right to move your head a bit; Jack Nicklaus thinks the head should be perfectly still. How can they both be right? Your thoughts?</strong></p>
<p>I certainly wouldn't question Jack Nicklaus' opinion; he has proven that having virtually no head movement during his swing helped make him one of the greatest players of all time. Jimmy Ballard is correct as well, because I don't think it is humanly possible to keep your head perfectly still. There is apt to be at least a bit of head movement with your swing. I believe it is a happy medium. Minimizing your head movement for your own personal swing is what is important. We all swing the club and putter differently, we are all built differently and we all have limits. Keeping your head still before, during and just after impact is crucial for a successful swing and putting stroke.</p>
<p><strong>26. SOUND OFF: Katie, use this space to talk about anything you’d like … as long as it’s golf related!</strong></p>
<p>I hope that many people will enjoy improved putting strokes as a result of practicing with O'BEAM.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you, Katie!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Humble Beginnings for O'Keefe: Confident O'Keefe Chases Pro Golf Dream in a $1 Car</strong></p>
<p>By John Brasier, The Sun News</p>
<p>SURFSIDE BEACH - Katie O'Keefe gave up everything to chase her dream of becoming a professional golfer.</p>
<p>In June of 1991, she left her family, her friends, her home and a solid job as a special education teacher. She traded it all for a $1 car and a dream.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old Rye, N.Y., native packed her big handicap and small financial resources into her newly purchased 1974 Vega and moved from her New York home to the Grand Strand.</p>
<p>For O'Keefe, a former college softball player, it wasn’t a tough decision.</p>
<p>""Not many people get a chance to what they really want to do,"" explained O'Keefe, who lowered a 20-handicap to a five in 15 months. ""I just wanted to play.""</p>
<p>After months of mailing letters and researching for a job where she could pursue a pro golf career, O'Keefe got her chance entirely by accident.</p>
<p>While on vacation in March 1991 with her father, ""Chubby,"" O'Keefe was ""discovered"" hitting balls on the range at Deer Track Golf Resort by Billy Delk, who was the head professional at the two courses.</p>
<p>""I was hitting some balls and Billy happened to be watching,"" remembered O'Keefe. ""When I was finished, he asked what school I played for and I told him I was out of school.""</p>
<p>""He asked me how long I’d been playing and I told him about 6 months. He said, 'We need to talk. Do you have any ambitions of playing golf?'""</p>
<p>O'Keefe wrote Delk a letter asking for an assistant's job. Delk didn’t have an opening, but he did offer her help with her game.</p>
<p>When school ended in June, O'Keefe didn't need much convincing to come to Surfside Beach to work with the veteran teacher.</p>
<p>Though Delk had seen her hitting balls just one time at the practice range, the former Clemson player knew she had the potential to be and outstanding golfer.</p>
<p>The athletic ability and competitiveness that made her an All American catcher were apparent even on the practice tee. She also has the desire needed to make it. At Deer Track, she practices 8 to 10 hours a day.</p>
<p>""She had some basic swings that were good,"" said Delk. ""She had a natural athletic ability. It is just something you spot in an athlete.""</p>
<p>Though Delk now teaches at Indigo Creek, Deer Track owner Gary Schaal and his staff have helped O'Keefe with support and advice when she isn't with Delk.</p>
<p>""I've always believed that the only thing that will stop me is not being able to generate enough funds,"" said O'Keefe while taking a break in the Deer Track snack bar. ""This is like a gold mine. ""Billy, Gary and the assistants have been just great to me. They always help me when I need it.""</p>
<p>The 5-foot-5 125-pound O'Keefe plays from the regular men's tees. She drives the ball 235 and has superior touch around the greens.</p>
<p>She's taken these talents with work and dedication to improve her game to the next level. Though she never played golf seriously before coming to Deer Track, the former University of San Diego catcher firmly believed she could excel in the sport if given the opportunity.</p>
<p>""When I was in college, I was on crutches watching golf on TV,"" remembered O'Keefe. ""I said to myself, that doesn't look so hard.""</p>
<p>Finding a place to play has always been O'Keefe's major problem. Growing up in Westchester County suburbs of New York City, O'Keefe lived near several prominent country clubs, but no public courses.</p>
<p>Without a country club membership, playing golf was difficult. But not impossible for O'Keefe. ""I spent my life sneaking on,"" she said with a smile. ""You just gotta do what you gotta do.""</p>
<p>My brothers and I use to just walk in to the pool a Westchester Country Club with towels and wave at the members, and they figured we were members. One time my brothers got in trouble and were suspended from a club and they weren't even members.""</p>
<p>O'Keefe had the same problem after college. Even when she applied to courses outside of New York, she couldn't find a place to play.</p>
<p>That all changed when she moved into a condo near the clubhouse at Deer Track and began taking lessons from Delk. About six months ago, she bought a membership at Deer Track.</p>
<p>O'Keefe has had money problems since she got here. Her family helps out, but she has to scrimp and save just to survive.</p>
<p>Last summer, O'Keefe worked nights as a waitress, I use to only eat when I was at work,"" said O'Keefe. ""I got real sick when I was doing that.""</p>
<p>O'Keefe said she isn't getting impatient with her rugged lifestyle. She's convinced she'll eventually be rewarded for her hard work.</p>
<p>When will she be ready to take on the LPGA Tour? ""That's such a hard question,"" admitted O'Keefe. ""Who knows? I just really don’t worry about that - I just worry about getting better.""</p>
<p>This year, O'Keefe has shown promise. Besides winning four tournaments in South Carolina, she's been competitive in two national events.</p>
<p>Delk predicts she'll be ready for the Futures Tour, the ladies' version of the Hogan Tour, next Spring.</p>
<p>""She's getting very, very close to getting to that level of play,"" said Delk. ""The biggest thing that's going to hold her back is monetary. She can go as far as she wants if she can achieve the monetary backing to go through that next level and make the next step to the professional level.""</p>
<p>If she gets there, O'Keefe won’t be driving a $1 car.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p></div>","What is the O'BEAM Putting Aid?
When it comes right down to it the most important part of scoring low in golf is being an excellent putter. Since most golfers, professionals included, move their head when they putt, their putting scores will be erratic. The O'Beam is a simple training aid - it provides immediate feedback about head movement, allowing golfers to correct the problem, which reduces putts and lowers their score.
The O'Beam started as a simple way to show my friend and student how much he was moving his head when putting. No matter what I did he still could not believe he was moving his head. I decided I needed to come up with something that will show him immediately how much his head was truly moving. I designed a laser to affix to the bill of a visor or hat that emits an ""O"" on the ball. After his very first stroke he was absolutely shocked; he worked with this device for a few days and before he knew it he was dropping putts and his scores started to drop dramatically.
He was so impressed as well as all of those who watched him practice with it, I was suddenly bombarded with demands for more units. I immediately realized that I needed to get more units, a patent, a logo, several made to meet the demand and I did. Before I knew it I ran into Chip Beck, Champions Tour Player, and he was mesmerized by the O’Beam. He asked for one and wanted to be the endorsing professional. While meeting with Chip Beck, several other Champions Tour Players were trying the O'Beam and were placing orders! Next, I was invited on to the Golf Channel for the Champions Tour Learning Channel to introduce the O'Beam.
O'Beam Project Mission:
There have been many challenges getting the O'Beam off the ground: patent, trademark, mold, laser design, unit design, packaging, TV interviews, radio interviews, newspaper and magazine interviews.... However, we have been able to overcome every challenge so far except generating enough money to provide this wonderful little device with the exposure it deserves to realize its full potential. There is no doubt that even the best products in the world need the proper exposure to be successful. There have been several marketing companies interested in marketing the O'Beam; however there is a large expense to marketing a product. That is why my biggest challenge is to generate funds to underwrite the marketing expenses. The O'Beam is an excellent product and the beauty is that we already know it is a success! The O'Beam sells itself from the website without adveritising, but even the best products in the world need the proper exposure.
Join the O'Beam team! Improve your game and help see that the O'Beam reaches its full marketing potential. Thank you!

A GolfConversations.com Interview with Katie O'Keefe, CEO O'BEAM
1. In a nutshell, what's an O'BEAM?
The O'Beam is a laser-guide putting aid that you attach to the bill of your hat. It emits a laser in the shape of an ""O"". When addressing the golf ball in your putting setup, you adjust the laser to have the ""O"" on the center of the golf ball. When you make your putting stroke, the O'Beam will instantly show you how much you are moving your head.
2. How and when did you come up with the idea for OB?
One of my students, Brian Callahan, who is now my business partner, could not keep his head still while putting, which resulted in high golf scores. He was frustrated because he could not recognize when and how much his head was moving. The only thing that I could think of was to attach a laser to his hat. There was no big plan and it was no more than a simple thought at the time.
3. What did your friends/family think when you told them about OB?
I didn't really tell anyone at first because it was just a simple aid to help my student. But when I realized how effective it was and how much it helped Brian, I thought some of my other students might benefit from it. I began to investigate what the next step would be to get O'BEAMs made. I told my family; however, they really didn't understand and I think they figured it would be just a passing interest and fizzle away. When I told my two best friends, though, Paige Phillips and Trish Wodatch, they both responded very nicely. Both were excited and felt that if anyone could make it happen, I could. Of course Brian was wonderful and very excited; he became my business partner in the venture.
4. You're a golf instructor, not an inventor; what kind of research did you do to learn about laser beams?
I read everything I could, via books and the Internet, about how lasers work.
5. I assume you had to have a person or company with some laser beam ""aptitude"" to help you develop a prototype, yes?
Actually, when I first got started, I had not yet even told Brian about it so I had no money to hire anyone to help me. I did all the research myself and created the first prototype on my own. I hired an engineer only after Brian used my very first prototype. Since I already had all the research completed, I just needed an engineer to put all my information into proper ""engineering terminology"" and do the CAD (computer-aided design) pictures.
6. Did you go through several prototypes before you found the one you wanted? What was that experience like?
No, I really knew from the start exactly what I wanted and the engineer copied my drawings almost to the letter. There was a slight change in shape because the batteries would not fit correctly into the shell of my original design. The clip I wanted was created so that the unit can rotate up and down to accommodate all setups. The only difficult thing for me was communicating with the engineers. Both were wonderful and very helpful. However, I learned in a hurry that you cannot ask an engineer a yes/no question. I wanted the laser to be in the shape of an ""O"" for two reasons: The golf ball is round and an ""O"" would be more visible, and because my last name is O'Keefe. The engineers told me this could not be done, that a laser, if magnified, looks like an asterisk, so there would be no way to make the ""O"" unless we used a screen on the lens that would make an ""O"". However, I knew this would minimize the strength of the laser thus making it difficult to see outside. So the long and the short of it was that I told the engineer to change how the laser sends its energy so that the shape is an ""O"" rather than *.
7. What specifically were you looking for in the final prototype?
Exactly what I wanted: a small, light unit with the laser in the shape of an ""O"" and a clip that rotates up and down.
8. After your prototype was created, did you use it with students? Touring pros? What was their reaction to the OB?
The first tour professional that I talked about it with was Tom Watson.

10.How many O'BEAMs were produced in the first run?
1000

We set up a Web site, www.obeamputt.com, and had a Google Adwords account using key words that drove traffic to the site. I was also fortunate to have been invited on the Champions Tour Learning Center on Golf Channel. This was a wonderful opportunity for me to introduce the O'Beam on television, and momentum started picking up.

15. What's been the reaction of your students to OB?
They love it and want to know why I didn't come up with this idea sooner!
16. Is OB safe? 
Can it burn your skin or burn grass or carpeting? Yes, it is safe. It is within the guidelines of the government.
17. How many batteries does OB require?
Three small ""nickel"" shaped batteries.

23. Do you have any recommendations as to how long you should practice your putting? (x% full swing, x% putting, x% chipping, etc.)
35% putting, 35% short game, 30% swing.
24. Why is it so difficult to keep your head still while putting?
I think there is a natural instinct to want to see where the ball is going. I tell my students all the time, if you lose a ball on the putting green you should probably be looking for another sport to play.

Humble Beginnings for O'Keefe: Confident O'Keefe Chases Pro Golf Dream in a $1 Car
By John Brasier, The Sun News
SURFSIDE BEACH - Katie O'Keefe gave up everything to chase her dream of becoming a professional golfer.
In June of 1991, she left her family, her friends, her home and a solid job as a special education teacher. She traded it all for a $1 car and a dream.
The 29-year-old Rye, N.Y., native packed her big handicap and small financial resources into her newly purchased 1974 Vega and moved from her New York home to the Grand Strand.
For O'Keefe, a former college softball player, it wasn’t a tough decision.
""Not many people get a chance to what they really want to do,"" explained O'Keefe, who lowered a 20-handicap to a five in 15 months. ""I just wanted to play.""
After months of mailing letters and researching for a job where she could pursue a pro golf career, O'Keefe got her chance entirely by accident.
While on vacation in March 1991 with her father, ""Chubby,"" O'Keefe was ""discovered"" hitting balls on the range at Deer Track Golf Resort by Billy Delk, who was the head professional at the two courses.
""I was hitting some balls and Billy happened to be watching,"" remembered O'Keefe. ""When I was finished, he asked what school I played for and I told him I was out of school.""
""He asked me how long I’d been playing and I told him about 6 months. He said, 'We need to talk. Do you have any ambitions of playing golf?'""
O'Keefe wrote Delk a letter asking for an assistant's job. Delk didn’t have an opening, but he did offer her help with her game.
When school ended in June, O'Keefe didn't need much convincing to come to Surfside Beach to work with the veteran teacher.
Though Delk had seen her hitting balls just one time at the practice range, the former Clemson player knew she had the potential to be and outstanding golfer.
The athletic ability and competitiveness that made her an All American catcher were apparent even on the practice tee. She also has the desire needed to make it. At Deer Track, she practices 8 to 10 hours a day.
""She had some basic swings that were good,"" said Delk. ""She had a natural athletic ability. It is just something you spot in an athlete.""
Though Delk now teaches at Indigo Creek, Deer Track owner Gary Schaal and his staff have helped O'Keefe with support and advice when she isn't with Delk.
""I've always believed that the only thing that will stop me is not being able to generate enough funds,"" said O'Keefe while taking a break in the Deer Track snack bar. ""This is like a gold mine. ""Billy, Gary and the assistants have been just great to me. They always help me when I need it.""
The 5-foot-5 125-pound O'Keefe plays from the regular men's tees. She drives the ball 235 and has superior touch around the greens.
She's taken these talents with work and dedication to improve her game to the next level. Though she never played golf seriously before coming to Deer Track, the former University of San Diego catcher firmly believed she could excel in the sport if given the opportunity.
""When I was in college, I was on crutches watching golf on TV,"" remembered O'Keefe. ""I said to myself, that doesn't look so hard.""
Finding a place to play has always been O'Keefe's major problem. Growing up in Westchester County suburbs of New York City, O'Keefe lived near several prominent country clubs, but no public courses.
Without a country club membership, playing golf was difficult. But not impossible for O'Keefe. ""I spent my life sneaking on,"" she said with a smile. ""You just gotta do what you gotta do.""
My brothers and I use to just walk in to the pool a Westchester Country Club with towels and wave at the members, and they figured we were members. One time my brothers got in trouble and were suspended from a club and they weren't even members.""
O'Keefe had the same problem after college. Even when she applied to courses outside of New York, she couldn't find a place to play.
That all changed when she moved into a condo near the clubhouse at Deer Track and began taking lessons from Delk. About six months ago, she bought a membership at Deer Track.
O'Keefe has had money problems since she got here. Her family helps out, but she has to scrimp and save just to survive.
Last summer, O'Keefe worked nights as a waitress, I use to only eat when I was at work,"" said O'Keefe. ""I got real sick when I was doing that.""
O'Keefe said she isn't getting impatient with her rugged lifestyle. She's convinced she'll eventually be rewarded for her hard work.
When will she be ready to take on the LPGA Tour? ""That's such a hard question,"" admitted O'Keefe. ""Who knows? I just really don’t worry about that - I just worry about getting better.""
This year, O'Keefe has shown promise. Besides winning four tournaments in South Carolina, she's been competitive in two national events.
Delk predicts she'll be ready for the Futures Tour, the ladies' version of the Hogan Tour, next Spring.
""She's getting very, very close to getting to that level of play,"" said Delk. ""The biggest thing that's going to hold her back is monetary. She can go as far as she wants if she can achieve the monetary backing to go through that next level and make the next step to the professional level.""
If she gets there, O'Keefe won’t be driving a $1 car.

<p><strong>Raising Awareness</strong></p>
<p>""It is a disgrace that so many Americans still lack access to basic oral health care. Kids and adults miss sleep, school and work due to untreated dental disease. They can't eat properly; they can't smile.</p>
<p>For years, the American Dental Association has been striving to raise awareness and develop solutions so more people can receive dental care. Dentists lead many of these efforts, but they can't do it alone. We all have a stake in this issue. Government, business leaders, insurance companies, health care professionals and individuals all must work together to get better dental care to the million of Americans who don't receive it.</p>
<p>Oral health care must be a priority. Untreated dental disease can lead to serious health problems: infection, damage to bone or nerve, and tooth loss. Infection from tooth disease can spread to other parts of the body and may even lead to death. Clearly, oral health is just as important as the health of the rest of your body.</p>
<p>Prevention is the key. Dental disease is almost entirely preventable. Drinking water with fluoride in it is very important. Also, simple measures like brushing and flossing teeth every day and eating a healthy diet can protect against tooth decay.</p>
<p>Pain from untreated dental decay results in lost school and work hours. Many with tooth pain seek care in hospital emergency rooms, most of which aren't well equipped to handle dental emergencies, and where the cost of treatment is far greater than a dental office visit. That's why we as a society must help provide access to dental care to underserved people. All of us -- government, business leaders, insurance companies, health care professionals and individuals -- must develop access to dental care solutions that work in our communities.""</p>
<p>At Cornerstone Dentistry, our team of Doctors have been dedicating as much time and resources as possible to serve our communities in pro-bono work. We constantly receive letters from people of all ages as how their teeth are affecting their overall health, work and social status. They cannot easily afford the care they deserve. Not having proper teeth to chew affects the amount of nutrient that their body can receive, thus affecting their entire health. The following is an example of hundreds of letters that we receive in the mail or via email on our face book page. The names of the following people have been covered to protect their privacy.</p>

<p><strong> </strong><span style=""font-size: 10px;"">I</span><em style=""font-size: 10px;""> am 21 years old and have had severe dental problems for years. bad teeth run in my family but i seem to have gotten the worst of it. my teeth are very weak and break off at the gums so there is still tooth in there and the holes can not close fully, or gums grow over broken bits of teeth which is painful. i cannot eat without pain, and my teeth will randomly start bleeding fom the holes in my gums. i live with constant pain, and am embarrassed to smile or even go in public sometimes. i have no insurance and am living with my in laws as my husband was released from the military. i really need some help and i know you do some pro bono work, but i dont even need it for free, i could find some way to do a payment plan if someone else needed the pro bono more than i do. all i ask is to be considered. it would mean more than the world to me if i could live my life again. thankyou so very much for taking the time to read this.</em></p>

<p><strong>How are we going to use the raised funds? </strong></p>
<p>Cornerstone Dentistry currently operates 3 locations in southern California with further scheduled expansion. The practices typically are servicing regular fee for service patients on average about 3 days a week with an additional 2 days a week available to serve people in need in our local communities. That is a total of 24 days a month combined among all of the offices. Our group consists of 6 dentists, 2 dental hygienists and 15 support staff members. With our current infrastructure in place, we are capable of utilizing the major part of all money raised in operating and providing dental care for patients in need.</p>
<p><strong>How we will qualify patients that need treatment?</strong></p>
<p>The program is open to any adult or children with a limited income or those who are referred to us with various organizational groups that have similar mission than us. Thus we do require proof of income from those who are seeking to benefit from this program. The program will provide up to $2000 per adult and $3000 per child in the areas of infection control, caries control, emergency dental services and restorative dentistry. If required treatment is beyond the covered benefit, an option of option of low cost treatment and payment options will be provided to each individual.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>This is your opportunity to help a fellow human being in need of basic dental care and help Cornerstone Dentistry expand its pro-bono work in their local communities.</p>
<p>Thank you for your support.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What other ways I can support your cause?</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>If you are not able to support us through your own funds, we appreciate it if you can promote our cause within your group of friends and family in various social networks that you belong to. Everything counts, as you will be helping your fellow human beings in need. </p>

For years, the American Dental Association has been striving to raise awareness and develop solutions so more people can receive dental care. Dentists lead many of these efforts, but they can't do it alone. We all have a stake in this issue. Government, business leaders, insurance companies, health care professionals and individuals all must work together to get better dental care to the million of Americans who don't receive it.
Oral health care must be a priority. Untreated dental disease can lead to serious health problems: infection, damage to bone or nerve, and tooth loss. Infection from tooth disease can spread to other parts of the body and may even lead to death. Clearly, oral health is just as important as the health of the rest of your body.
Prevention is the key. Dental disease is almost entirely preventable. Drinking water with fluoride in it is very important. Also, simple measures like brushing and flossing teeth every day and eating a healthy diet can protect against tooth decay.
Pain from untreated dental decay results in lost school and work hours. Many with tooth pain seek care in hospital emergency rooms, most of which aren't well equipped to handle dental emergencies, and where the cost of treatment is far greater than a dental office visit. That's why we as a society must help provide access to dental care to underserved people. All of us -- government, business leaders, insurance companies, health care professionals and individuals -- must develop access to dental care solutions that work in our communities.""
At Cornerstone Dentistry, our team of Doctors have been dedicating as much time and resources as possible to serve our communities in pro-bono work. We constantly receive letters from people of all ages as how their teeth are affecting their overall health, work and social status. They cannot easily afford the care they deserve. Not having proper teeth to chew affects the amount of nutrient that their body can receive, thus affecting their entire health. The following is an example of hundreds of letters that we receive in the mail or via email on our face book page. The names of the following people have been covered to protect their privacy.

From Cornerstone Dentistry inbox Facebook page
 I am 21 years old and have had severe dental problems for years. bad teeth run in my family but i seem to have gotten the worst of it. my teeth are very weak and break off at the gums so there is still tooth in there and the holes can not close fully, or gums grow over broken bits of teeth which is painful. i cannot eat without pain, and my teeth will randomly start bleeding fom the holes in my gums. i live with constant pain, and am embarrassed to smile or even go in public sometimes. i have no insurance and am living with my in laws as my husband was released from the military. i really need some help and i know you do some pro bono work, but i dont even need it for free, i could find some way to do a payment plan if someone else needed the pro bono more than i do. all i ask is to be considered. it would mean more than the world to me if i could live my life again. thankyou so very much for taking the time to read this.

How are we going to use the raised funds? 
Cornerstone Dentistry currently operates 3 locations in southern California with further scheduled expansion. The practices typically are servicing regular fee for service patients on average about 3 days a week with an additional 2 days a week available to serve people in need in our local communities. That is a total of 24 days a month combined among all of the offices. Our group consists of 6 dentists, 2 dental hygienists and 15 support staff members. With our current infrastructure in place, we are capable of utilizing the major part of all money raised in operating and providing dental care for patients in need.
How we will qualify patients that need treatment?
The program is open to any adult or children with a limited income or those who are referred to us with various organizational groups that have similar mission than us. Thus we do require proof of income from those who are seeking to benefit from this program. The program will provide up to $2000 per adult and $3000 per child in the areas of infection control, caries control, emergency dental services and restorative dentistry. If required treatment is beyond the covered benefit, an option of option of low cost treatment and payment options will be provided to each individual.
 
This is your opportunity to help a fellow human being in need of basic dental care and help Cornerstone Dentistry expand its pro-bono work in their local communities.
Thank you for your support.
 
 
 
What other ways I can support your cause?
If you are not able to support us through your own funds, we appreciate it if you can promote our cause within your group of friends and family in various social networks that you belong to. Everything counts, as you will be helping your fellow human beings in need.

<br/><p></p>
<p>This November 108 lives Australia plan to bring Solar Power to Mount Summit Boarding School in Kathmandu, Nepal. We want to give hot water for showers and bathing to the young students at Mount Summit before the freezing temperatures of Nepal's Himalayan winter set in.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>The school helps as many families affected by poverty as they can. Children that would otherwise not get an education are housed, fed and cared for by the school. They are also supplied with their books and other school requirements. </p>
<p>Mount Summit School is an intensely social and community minded organisation in<br/>Kathmandu, striving to do all they can in support of children in need. They believe deeply in the opportunity and life changing benefits that education provides, and they continually strive towards this aim. </p>
<h3><strong>You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Even with the benefits the children gain at Mount Summit, conditions are rugged by our standard. The age of the children range from 4 to 16, and the unfortunate, but often necessary separation from parents and family is emotionally distressing to many of the very young students. </p>
<p>The students live at close quarters together, dorm style. Warmth and comfort are a necessity for the health and wellbeing of the young children, they often have colds and runny noses, and the older students have their own hygiene needs as they develop. </p>
<p>Imagine in the middle of winter, with a chill in the air, a bare brick cubicle with bare cement floor, bare light globe hanging from the ceiling....which is ok when the electricity is on! No comforts...it is bare, <span>drafty and cold! Now imagine sending your kids to have a shower.</span></p>
<p><b>You can help</b>.....by helping the school with its wish to install Solar Panels for hot<br/>water, the children would finally have the comfort of hot water for showers....something we all take for granted in the western world. But for  these children, it would be a gracious gift!</p>
<p>With the addition of power storage, the solar panels will also provide enough back up power for running lights when the main power supply is down. This is a daily occurrence in Nepal with load shedding being a national practice for coping with<br/>power demands. </p>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p><strong>$1,800</strong> will cover costs for the Solar Panel set up and installation (with a little margin for fees and charges).</p>
<p>As with all 108 lives projects funds raised go directly to the cause for which we are campaigning. Unlike large Not-For-Profits with large overheads, our projects are carried out by volunteers. We like to see funds go to their designated cause just as much as you do!</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal this time round, the funds will be added to at our next fundraising opportunity until this project is accomplished! </p>
<h3>Previous Successes</h3>
<p>108 lives Australia have previously succeed in supplying benches to Mount Summit School, helping to address the problem of crowding in the classrooms.<br/></p>
<p>With our most recent project earlier this year, Bev Carter and Jo Grant returned, installing 8 computers providing learning access to the school and students (...you might have caught that campaign here). A very satisfying and meaningful result that will directly affect the educational outcomes for hundreds of children!</p>

When you look on him, you might be surprised and fooled when someone try to tell you that this kid is sick - he is like a ""quicksilver"" - he is everywhere, asking million questions per minute. Recently he started individual education at his home, in order to prevent any infections, and became a huge fan of Star Wars - his favourite character is Lord Vader.More pictures and informations (unfortunately in Polish) you can find on Simon's Facebook page - https://www.facebook.com/sercedlaszymona?fref=tsAlso more details in Polish again on the webpage - http://szymek.frostfire.vxm.pl 
If you would be interested to know more about him feel free to contact me directly and I will try to answer to all your questions.


   What We Need & What You Get




 

Well, we need to collect almost 37.000 EUR for the second surgery - first one which happened last year in Munster, Germany - under control of dr. E.Malec was successful and Simon is a joyful young kid who is howling to live forever!
We already performing similar crowd funding action in Poland, his parents and the Foundation is organising concerts to collect the money, charity actions are also held. 
The next surgery need to be made ASAP as the body of this young person is growing fast and the heart might not stand.
The surgeries are divided for 3 ""phases"" :
1. first - made in 2014 - already happened - doctors were surprised that after 2 days from the surgery he was running on the corridor like he was cured for flue
2. second - which should happened this year - fingers crossed to collect the money
3. most probably next year (2016) if all will be fine after the second surgery.
Unfortunately apart of big THANK YOU we can not give you more




    Other Ways You Can Help - pray for Simon's health and his parent to have strength and motivation to finish the long and bumpy journey, as it is jut the beginning.

Well, not anymore. Our dedicated team of medical professionals and UX designers have come up with a solution which gonna treat wounds, sprain and rash like, for example, herpes with low-intensity laser beam (120 mW, 808 nM) super efficiently at home or on the go. Several researches prove that treating certain illness with laser beam reduces healing time 2 to 6 times. Our tests show that it's possible to prevent early-stage herpes and get momentarily relief. Treating herpes with LLLT prolongs remission time significantly.</p>

</div></div>","Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) hardware Laser medicine has always been considered expensive and complex. Well, not anymore. Our dedicated team of medical professionals and UX designers have come up with a solution which gonna treat wounds, sprain and rash like, for example, herpes with low-intensity laser beam (120 mW, 808 nM) super efficiently at home or on the go. Several researches prove that treating certain illness with laser beam reduces healing time 2 to 6 times. Our tests show that it's possible to prevent early-stage herpes and get momentarily relief. Treating herpes with LLLT prolongs remission time significantly.


The product is fully tested on all age groups, skin-types and allergies. It is 100% safe for domestic use. Now is the time to apply for all necessary certificates which would allow us to call it a medical device. This is where we need your help - to raise funds for certification process and get the first batch of the product to our first happy customers.
The best ways to use BambooLaser:


How it works
 Cells and tissues that are placed under our skin thrive for the sunlight. Like our bodies are programmed to wake up with a morning light, cells become active when they receive a low-intensity laser beam. They think of it as the sun rising above the horizon. LLLT treatment improves immunity, microcirculation in blood and lymphatic vessels. 



First LLLT device with its mobile app

You can control and monitor your BambooLaser with a mobile app on your smartphone, connected to a device via bluetooth. It gives you more targeted, more individualized and precise treatment for each case. The app runs on iOS and Android smartphones, it keeps your treatment history, reminds you of necessary sessions and shows the status of the battery. BambooLaser device is charged via micro USB port and the battery lasts up to 2 weeks when used regularly and more than 2 months when used passively. It has ergonomic design (inspired by bamboo) and it's environmentally friendly.

<p></p>

<p>This is expensive and unhealthy.  Urinary Tract Infections are the leading cause of rehospitalization for people with SCI/D and the current process of catheterization is archaic and medieval.  The plastic tube used to drain the bladder is essentially the same as any plastic straw.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Neurogenic Bladder</h3>
<div>Neurogenic Bladder is a condition that affects millions of Americans every year.  It often leaves a person unable to sense the fullness of their bladder and unable to control the voiding process.  This means that users often go to the bathroom more than they need to, avoid drinking anything but water, totally dehydrate themselves before a car or plane ride, and resort to virtually anything that will prevent them from having an accident in public.  This condition doesn't just affect people who were traumatically injured, the truth is that if you live long enough you have a pretty high chance of developing some form of urinary incontinence.  Other conditions that may result in Neurogenic Bladder include:</div>

<div>The main methods of management for Neurogenic Bladder all have significant drawbacks and issues.  The methods of management include:</div>
<div>Intermittent (Disposable) Catheters (L): Disposable catheters that are inserted 5-10x per day.  The risks associated with this method include infection, false passage (urethral trauma), and strictures.</div>
<div>Indwelling (Foley) Catheters (R): A semi-permanent catheter that connects to a urine collection bag on the leg or wheelchair of the user.  Risks associated include infections and trauma to the bladder wall from the tip of the catheter.</div>
<div>Suprapubic Catheters: The same as an Indwelling catheter but requires a surgical incision in the stomach for the catheter to access the bladder.  Also connects to a leg bag but comes out of the stomach.  </div>
</div>
<ul>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h3>The Solution = A ""Smart"" Catheter</h3> <p>Although the Connected Catheter™ utilizes some highly innovative and advanced technologies, our team has taken a problem first approach to solving this issue and are trying to accomplish two primary objectives:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Tell me when my bladder is full</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Let me empty it without inserting catheters into my body 5-10x per day</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In doing this we also have identified secondary aims that we know will create and capture value for providers and insurers.  We are committed to improving this experience for users, clinicians/providers and payers all at the same time.  We hope to improve patient outcomes while decreasing costs for any payers (supplies and costs of care).  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440730472/v0lzdrbjr5m87klwob81.png"" src="""" style=""""/><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Technology</h3>
<div>The technology behind the Connected Catheter™ allows us to achieve the following key product features (many of which have never been incorporated into a product for users):</div>
<div></div>
<p><i>Semi-Permanent </i>- One Connected Catheter will last for approximately one month and may replace as many as 200 intermittent (disposable) catheters.</p>
<p><i>Minimally-Invasive </i>- The Connected Catheter is inserted and extracted through the urethra almost exactly the same way that intermittent and indwelling (Foley) catheters.</p>
<p><i>Fully-Internal </i>- The Connected Catheter is fully internal to the body.  The valve is positioned at the base of the penis and is easily actuated by the user.</p>
<p><i>Quickly Inserted/Removed</i> - Our insertion/extraction mechanism allows a clinician or user insert/remove the device so that it can be removed in the event of Autonomic Dysreflexia or any other issue.  </p>
<p><b><i>Connected</i></b> - Our device wirelessly relays pressure data to an external device that alerts a user when their bladder is full and about to void.  This also offers clinicians the opportunity to utilize predictive analytics and advanced software algorithms to make more informed decisions.  </p>
<p></p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Many people don't realize just how debilitating the conditions associated with paralysis can be.  It is common for people to see a wheelchair and think ""Oh man, that must be really tough because he/she can't walk.""  I thought the same thing before my injury but what I learned was that the human body was not designed to spend the entire day in a seated position.  A variety of secondary conditions result from this issue that are often more troubling than the mobility issue.  </p>
<p>In peer-reviewed research, a doctor asked paraplegics and quadriplegics what function they would choose to return if they had the option and<span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> paraplegics reported Trunk </span>Stability<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, Sexual Function, and Bowel/Bladder Function all as more important than the ability to walk.  This is similar for quadriplegics except that they also would rather regain Hand/Arm function ahead of walking in addition to the Trunk Stability, Sexual Function, and Bowel/Bladder function.  This is the truth that most people don't see and prefer not to talk about (because it can be </span>embarrassing<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">).</span><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The Impact our product can have is vast.  One Urologist with over two decades of experience treating Neurogenic Bladder said,</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<blockquote>""Imagine the improvement in quality of life for the millions  of patients who wear permanent indwelling urinary catheters or do intermittent catheterizations...  As someone who has managed thousands of patients with neurogenic bladder and urine retention who need the assistance of a catheter to maintain renal function, this device  could be revolutionary in its impact.""</blockquote>

<h3><b>Risks &amp; Challenges </b></h3>
<p>This is a <b>HUGE</b> undertaking.  Traditionally, medical devices that are regulated by the US FDA (like ours will be) and other regulatory agencies abroad don't fare well on crowdfunding websites because it is such a complex and challenging landscape to navigate.  The reason we have chosen to launch this campaign is because we HAVE to generate support.  The momentum from this campaign will raise money (which is essential for our success) but will also show any potential investors that this is a significant issue.  If you are unable to donate any money, please support us by leaving a note of encouragement, sharing our story with friends, or by giving any sort of feedback (positive or negative).  The only way we can be successful is with your help.  </p>
<p>Additionally, we have analyzed the risks associated with this project thoroughly and have noted the following key components which we will address continually throughout the development and fielding of our product:</p>
<p><i>Engineering: </i>We have identified and are hiring a world-class team of engineers to assist in developing this product.  We also have identified external consultants that will be critical in supporting our engineering processes.  </p>
<p><i>Regulatory:</i> We have worked diligently to identify and address any potential risks throughout our design process.  We will continue to ensure the product meets the highest levels of safety and testing standards as set forth by applicable US FDA and other regulatory agencies (in applicable geographies).</p>
<p><i>Market Adoption: </i>We have talked with thousands of stakeholders.  For the past few years of my life I have made myself an expert on paralysis and met so many people who have confirmed the same problems and complaints that I experience.  Our team has spent time with world-leading clinicians to ensure that we can design a product to meet the complex needs of our target population.  </p>

to reduce the risk of infection.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">The user data will be cataloged
through a cloud-based software program and will provide meaningful insight for
clinicians and researchers. Clinicians will be able to utilize this data for
predictive analytics, identifying and treating potential issues in their
earliest stages, and researchers will have new metrics to analyze any potential
correlations between bladder pressure and other clinical indications.
Currently, no one has captured this uro-dynamics data in a meaningful way.</span></p>
<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">How does it work?</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">The Connected Catheter includes
both a valve and a miniaturized (passive RF) pressure sensor. The device will
be inserted into the bladder of an individual with minimally invasive means by
the individual or by a clinician to accurately detect the pressure exerted by
the urine in the bladder. This device will be made out of safe, FDA-approved
materials that will be tested for accuracy, reliability and safety prior to
being inserted in the bladder designed to withstand the environment in the
bladder, and not irritate the bladder wall lining.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Dynamic software algorithm will
monitor bladder pressures and once the pressure threshold (~40cm H2O) is
reached in the bladder, an alert will be sent to the user’s smartphone (or
other external device) notifying the user that their bladder is approaching the
safe limit. The user will then go to a bathroom where they can safely empty
their bladder by squeezing the duckbill check valve at the base of the penis.
The user will be able to control emptying of the bladder by applying a gentle
amount of pressure to the valve (similar to a CamelBak Bite Valve).</span></p>
<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Will The Connected Catheter’s
valve leak?</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">The valve is designed so that when
the bladder reaches a certain pressure (just below the safe limit), the valve
will open with or without user input. This feature is critically important and
will dramatically change the way that neurogenic bladder is treated because
currently, with ICP, a person’s bladder can reach a level where the pressure is
high enough to cause the bladder to spasm. If the bladder sphincter does not
open when the bladder spasms, then urine will be shot back up to the kidneys
where it is likely to cause a kidney infection (bladder detrusor-sphincter
dyssynergia). With The Connected Catheter, we can eliminate the possibility of
the bladder ever reaching a dangerous level, and improve patient safety because
the valve will open whether or not a user is actively managing this function.</span></p>
<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">How long does it last?</b></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">The Connected Catheter is designed

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">Every year, millions of people
suffer from neurogenic bladder in the USA. This condition is a dysfunction of
the urinary bladder due to disease of the central nervous system or peripheral nerves
involved in the control of micturition (urination). Individuals with neurogenic
bladder may not feel the urge to void or feel a sense of bladder distension.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;text-align: center;background-color: initial;"">People suffering from this
condition use catheters to relieve their bladders of urine, and they often
cannot determine when or how often they need to void because they lack
sensation. This puts individual users at risk for increased complications (such
as urinary tract infection and false passage) and results in a waste of medical
supplies, such as disposable intermittent catheters.</span></p>

</div></div>","Dealing with Paralysis and SCI/D I knew my life would change, but I didn't know that managing my bladder would be the most challenging task I faced on a daily basis.  As a individual living each day with paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury, I understand just how terrible the current standard of care can be for managing Neurogenic Bladder.  Every day, I have to insert small dispoable catheters into my body in order to relieve my bladder of urine.  These devices have changed very little over the past century and I believe it is time to innovate radically to improve the quality of life for people like me.  


This is expensive and unhealthy.  Urinary Tract Infections are the leading cause of rehospitalization for people with SCI/D and the current process of catheterization is archaic and medieval.  The plastic tube used to drain the bladder is essentially the same as any plastic straw.

Neurogenic Bladder
Neurogenic Bladder is a condition that affects millions of Americans every year.  It often leaves a person unable to sense the fullness of their bladder and unable to control the voiding process.  This means that users often go to the bathroom more than they need to, avoid drinking anything but water, totally dehydrate themselves before a car or plane ride, and resort to virtually anything that will prevent them from having an accident in public.  This condition doesn't just affect people who were traumatically injured, the truth is that if you live long enough you have a pretty high chance of developing some form of urinary incontinence.  Other conditions that may result in Neurogenic Bladder include:



Alzheimer's Disease


ALS


MS


Spinal Cord Injury and Disease


Dementia


Peripheral Nerve Damage


Stroke


Cerebral Palsy

Parkinsons


The main methods of management for Neurogenic Bladder all have significant drawbacks and issues.  The methods of management include:
Intermittent (Disposable) Catheters (L): Disposable catheters that are inserted 5-10x per day.  The risks associated with this method include infection, false passage (urethral trauma), and strictures.
Indwelling (Foley) Catheters (R): A semi-permanent catheter that connects to a urine collection bag on the leg or wheelchair of the user.  Risks associated include infections and trauma to the bladder wall from the tip of the catheter.
Suprapubic Catheters: The same as an Indwelling catheter but requires a surgical incision in the stomach for the catheter to access the bladder.  Also connects to a leg bag but comes out of the stomach.  


   
The Solution = A ""Smart"" Catheter Although the Connected Catheter™ utilizes some highly innovative and advanced technologies, our team has taken a problem first approach to solving this issue and are trying to accomplish two primary objectives:



Tell me when my bladder is full


Let me empty it without inserting catheters into my body 5-10x per day


In doing this we also have identified secondary aims that we know will create and capture value for providers and insurers.  We are committed to improving this experience for users, clinicians/providers and payers all at the same time.  We hope to improve patient outcomes while decreasing costs for any payers (supplies and costs of care).  


The Technology
The technology behind the Connected Catheter™ allows us to achieve the following key product features (many of which have never been incorporated into a product for users):

Semi-Permanent - One Connected Catheter will last for approximately one month and may replace as many as 200 intermittent (disposable) catheters.
Minimally-Invasive - The Connected Catheter is inserted and extracted through the urethra almost exactly the same way that intermittent and indwelling (Foley) catheters.
Fully-Internal - The Connected Catheter is fully internal to the body.  The valve is positioned at the base of the penis and is easily actuated by the user.
Quickly Inserted/Removed - Our insertion/extraction mechanism allows a clinician or user insert/remove the device so that it can be removed in the event of Autonomic Dysreflexia or any other issue.  
Connected - Our device wirelessly relays pressure data to an external device that alerts a user when their bladder is full and about to void.  This also offers clinicians the opportunity to utilize predictive analytics and advanced software algorithms to make more informed decisions.  


    The Impact Many people don't realize just how debilitating the conditions associated with paralysis can be.  It is common for people to see a wheelchair and think ""Oh man, that must be really tough because he/she can't walk.""  I thought the same thing before my injury but what I learned was that the human body was not designed to spend the entire day in a seated position.  A variety of secondary conditions result from this issue that are often more troubling than the mobility issue.  
In peer-reviewed research, a doctor asked paraplegics and quadriplegics what function they would choose to return if they had the option and paraplegics reported Trunk Stability, Sexual Function, and Bowel/Bladder Function all as more important than the ability to walk.  This is similar for quadriplegics except that they also would rather regain Hand/Arm function ahead of walking in addition to the Trunk Stability, Sexual Function, and Bowel/Bladder function.  This is the truth that most people don't see and prefer not to talk about (because it can be embarrassing).
The Impact our product can have is vast.  One Urologist with over two decades of experience treating Neurogenic Bladder said,

""Imagine the improvement in quality of life for the millions  of patients who wear permanent indwelling urinary catheters or do intermittent catheterizations...  As someone who has managed thousands of patients with neurogenic bladder and urine retention who need the assistance of a catheter to maintain renal function, this device  could be revolutionary in its impact.""

    

The Team
We have assembled a talented team of engineers and clinicians to develop this product.  Currently, there are two full-time employees (1 MBA, 1 PHD), two part-time consultants (2 PHD), and a large network of advisors (financial, clinical, regulatory, reimbursement, product development, federal grant writing).
In the past few months we have been successful in local business plan competitions and were accepted to a highly-competitive virtual accelerator this past summer.

In addition to these recent accolades, our team has been involved in many other aspects of medical technology, some of which have been publicized widely.  One example of this is when our CEO and founder, Derek, became the first person in the USA to own a personal ExoSkeleton (a device that allows paraplegics to stand and walk).  With this device Derek was able to stand and walk to be awarded the Bronze Star medal (with V) at his retirement ceremony this past November.  


Our team has made many other contributions to advancing science and supporting world-leading medical research.  If you are interested in learning more about our experience please feel free to email us and we would be happy to talk more about this in a separate forum.  


Risks & Challenges 
This is a HUGE undertaking.  Traditionally, medical devices that are regulated by the US FDA (like ours will be) and other regulatory agencies abroad don't fare well on crowdfunding websites because it is such a complex and challenging landscape to navigate.  The reason we have chosen to launch this campaign is because we HAVE to generate support.  The momentum from this campaign will raise money (which is essential for our success) but will also show any potential investors that this is a significant issue.  If you are unable to donate any money, please support us by leaving a note of encouragement, sharing our story with friends, or by giving any sort of feedback (positive or negative).  The only way we can be successful is with your help.  
Additionally, we have analyzed the risks associated with this project thoroughly and have noted the following key components which we will address continually throughout the development and fielding of our product:
Engineering: We have identified and are hiring a world-class team of engineers to assist in developing this product.  We also have identified external consultants that will be critical in supporting our engineering processes.  
Regulatory: We have worked diligently to identify and address any potential risks throughout our design process.  We will continue to ensure the product meets the highest levels of safety and testing standards as set forth by applicable US FDA and other regulatory agencies (in applicable geographies).
Market Adoption: We have talked with thousands of stakeholders.  For the past few years of my life I have made myself an expert on paralysis and met so many people who have confirmed the same problems and complaints that I experience.  Our team has spent time with world-leading clinicians to ensure that we can design a product to meet the complex needs of our target population.

FAQ
What is The Connected Catheter?
The Connected Catheter is a
technological solution for patients with neurogenic bladder. Our solution is a
semi-permanent, minimally-invasive, “smart catheter” system that measures bladder pressure and
wirelessly transmits data to a smartphone, allows the user to control a
valve to empty the urine from the bladder, eliminates the need for
intermittent catheters and drainage bags, can be inserted/removed by the
user (or clinician) in minutes, and is fully encapsulated in the body
to reduce the risk of infection.
The user data will be cataloged
through a cloud-based software program and will provide meaningful insight for
clinicians and researchers. Clinicians will be able to utilize this data for
predictive analytics, identifying and treating potential issues in their
earliest stages, and researchers will have new metrics to analyze any potential
correlations between bladder pressure and other clinical indications.
Currently, no one has captured this uro-dynamics data in a meaningful way.
How does it work?
The Connected Catheter includes
both a valve and a miniaturized (passive RF) pressure sensor. The device will
be inserted into the bladder of an individual with minimally invasive means by
the individual or by a clinician to accurately detect the pressure exerted by
the urine in the bladder. This device will be made out of safe, FDA-approved
materials that will be tested for accuracy, reliability and safety prior to
being inserted in the bladder designed to withstand the environment in the
bladder, and not irritate the bladder wall lining.
Dynamic software algorithm will
monitor bladder pressures and once the pressure threshold (~40cm H2O) is
reached in the bladder, an alert will be sent to the user’s smartphone (or
other external device) notifying the user that their bladder is approaching the
safe limit. The user will then go to a bathroom where they can safely empty
their bladder by squeezing the duckbill check valve at the base of the penis.
The user will be able to control emptying of the bladder by applying a gentle
amount of pressure to the valve (similar to a CamelBak Bite Valve).
Will The Connected Catheter’s
valve leak?
The valve is designed so that when
the bladder reaches a certain pressure (just below the safe limit), the valve
will open with or without user input. This feature is critically important and
will dramatically change the way that neurogenic bladder is treated because
currently, with ICP, a person’s bladder can reach a level where the pressure is
high enough to cause the bladder to spasm. If the bladder sphincter does not
open when the bladder spasms, then urine will be shot back up to the kidneys
where it is likely to cause a kidney infection (bladder detrusor-sphincter
dyssynergia). With The Connected Catheter, we can eliminate the possibility of
the bladder ever reaching a dangerous level, and improve patient safety because
the valve will open whether or not a user is actively managing this function.
How long does it last?
The Connected Catheter is designed
to stay in a patient’s body up to 28 days before it must be replaced.
How is it inserted and removed?
The Connected Catheter will be
inserted into the bladder of an individual with minimally invasive means by the
individual or by a clinician. The device will be able to be easily removed by
an individual or by a clinician within a matter of minutes.
What does the pressure sensor do?
The miniaturized pressure sensor
utilizes passive RF technology to accurately detect the pressure exerted by the
urine in the bladder. Dynamic software algorithm will monitor bladder pressures
and once the pressure threshold (~40cm H2O) is reached in the bladder, an alert
will be sent to the user’s smartphone (or other external device) notifying the user
that their bladder is approaching the safe limit.
Is radio frequency (RF) technology
dangerous?
All RF exposure resulting from use
of The Connected Catheter will fall within the safe limits, outlined by the
FCC. To learn more, please refer to this guide by the FCC:
https://www.fcc.gov/guides/wireless-devices-and-health-concerns
Is the technology patented?
There is a robust portfolio of patents and all technology disclosed in this campaign is patent pending.  Please contact us to learn more about our intellectual property status.
Who could use The Connected
Catheter?
According to the National
Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, 16 million adults in
the United States have urinary incontinence issues and are unable to properly
regulate urination. Spinal Singularity has focused on the neurogenic bladder
subset of this market because that is the primary condition resulting from
paralysis and SCI/D.
Can women use The Connected
Catheter?
At present, the development of The
Connected Catheter is focused for use by male patients. Spinal Singularity aims
to develop a version for female versions once the male version has been fully
developed.
What is neurogenic bladder?
Every year, millions of people
suffer from neurogenic bladder in the USA. This condition is a dysfunction of
the urinary bladder due to disease of the central nervous system or peripheral nerves
involved in the control of micturition (urination). Individuals with neurogenic
bladder may not feel the urge to void or feel a sense of bladder distension.
People suffering from this
condition use catheters to relieve their bladders of urine, and they often
cannot determine when or how often they need to void because they lack
sensation. This puts individual users at risk for increased complications (such
as urinary tract infection and false passage) and results in a waste of medical
supplies, such as disposable intermittent catheters.
Who is affected by neurogenic
bladder?
Neurogenic bladder is most
commonly associated with neurological disorders such as paralysis from spinal
cord injury and disease (SCI/D). It may also be caused by any of the following
conditions:



Alzheimer disease


Birth defects of the spinal cord


Brain or spinal cord tumors


Cerebral palsy


Encephalitis


Learning disabilities such as
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)


Multiple sclerosis


Parkinson disease


Spinal cord injury


Stroke


Damage or disorders of the nerves
that supply the bladder can also cause this
condition. These can include:



Nerve damage (neuropathy)


Nerve damage due to long-term,
heavy alcohol use


Nerve damage due to long-term
diabetes


Vitamin B12 deficiency


Nerve damage from syphilis


Nerve damage due to pelvic
surgery


Nerve damage from a herniated
disc or spinal canal stenosis


What are the alternative
treatments/solutions?

<p><b><span>The
Story</span></b></p>
<p>Our inventor suffered of different
kind disorders for very long time. She had constipation problems since memory;
she defecate one very few days even one a week, gastrointestinal movement was
very slow. She had very low energy level; every a few hours she need to lie
down to take a rest. She did not have any motivation to do anything. Poor
appetites, light sleeping at night. She became so forgetful in her early of
40s. But one day, these problem changes, she visited a friend who has a cottage
in the countryside. She stayed in his cottage a few days, most of these
problems gone. She figured out there must something good happened in the
countryside.  Unfortunately, these problems came back when she came back
to the city.</p>
<p>Back and forth for a few times,
the same cycles repeat. She wants to find out the reason. After thinking and
thinking, trying and trying, through error &amp; trail with a background
of electronic hardware engineer. She found there are some electronic signals
missing in our cities. These signals might be blocked by other wireless signals ,
traffic etc. Like vitamins in food, these signals are essential to our body.
These signals acts like a commander to order cells and organs in our body. She took
readings &amp; notes of these signals and made a device to recreate these signals.
She found the missing “Link”! </p>
<p>After she have tried on herself
for more than 1 year, the result is amazing!! She felt completed
different!! First she have better appetites, she tasted food better than
before, she enjoy eating different kind of foods; her constipation is gone, she
have more energy to work and enjoy the life, she have more motivation to do new
things. She felt stronger and happier. She was getting better sleep; her memory
is getting better day by day!  She is able to learn new subjects AND challenges.
In her ago of late 40s, for this project, she learned in electronic hardware
engineer background to start in C and program this device. Without help of this
device of generation 1 and 2, she said that she was never able to program this device.
Now she’s fulfilled that quest!</p>
<p>About 10 years ago, she started
her second career as acupuncturist and herbalist. After she tried on this
device, she checked her pulse and reading her tongue, quality of pulse and
tongue had been improved a lot. </p>
<p>We had told a few alternative
practitioners about this device, they are very interested in it and agreed with
this invention. They have tried this device on their clients, the result are
very promising. Now they are become part of the team of
“Universe-Link”. They use it to extent life for a patient who suffer of
Lymphatic cancer, use it to  reducing pain and hand numbness causing by
the cervical disk arthritis, use it to do weight loss,  use
it to treat Sub-Health, use it to heal
a hypo-tension patient. The possibilities are endless!</p>
<p>Until today, she has spent all of
her saving to build different kind of prototypes: Generation one, two and
three. She did all the hardware design by herself, and program it by
herself. The one in the picture is Generation three which is ready to be
launched.</p>
<p>We would like more people benefit

<p>You can never expect to achieve a consistent swing if you set up to the ball differently each time. TALON gives you the opportunity to achieve your optimum posture position before you strike the ball. You'll know if your shoulders have dropped or if your back is overarching, even if your club-face is open, closed or square to target! TALON removes the guesswork and helps you to practice purposefully bringing you one step closer to achieving consistency in your game.<br/></p>

<p>How you set up and address the ball is fundamental to every golfer’s game, from beginners to professionals. However, teaching, learning and replicating the optimum set up for golfing success has previously relied upon basic unreliable methods which cannot be quantified or accurately replicated. For example, relying on 'feel', looking in a mirror and retrospective video analysis. </p>
<p>We have developed a revolutionary new training aid that gives you real-time visual feedback on your golf stance and angles of address. TALON removes the guess work and gives you all the critical information you need to set up to the ball with the same posture, every time – improving muscle memory, consistency and optimum performance. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Using our simple alignment tool, line
up and attach the TALON gripper to any club you would like to use. The TALON digital display unit simply clicks
in and out of the gripper, allowing you to easily switch the unit between
different clubs you may be practising with. When you are not using the TALON a
smart rubber cap fits over the gripper protecting it in all weathers, meaning
you can leave the gripper in place at all times.</p>
<p>The digital display and back unit are
charged via a USB connection and provide 8 hours of continuous use, plenty of
time for a leisurely 18 holes or some hard core practice on the range.</p>

'The Talon is a total game changer' - National Club Golfer

""Ojee Golf has unveiled its revolutionary Talon training aid"" - Golf Monthly

Gearhacker: The 5 Best Geeky Golf Gadgets to Instantly Improve Your Game

CLICK HERE TO READ ALL OUR LATEST REVIEWS







You can never expect to achieve a consistent swing if you set up to the ball differently each time. TALON gives you the opportunity to achieve your optimum posture position before you strike the ball. You'll know if your shoulders have dropped or if your back is overarching, even if your club-face is open, closed or square to target! TALON removes the guesswork and helps you to practice purposefully bringing you one step closer to achieving consistency in your game.




So, how important is your set-up / posture?



Well two of the games greatest had something to say on the matter;



""I feel that hitting specific shots -- playing the ball to a certain place in a certain way -- is 50 percent mental picture, 40 percent setup, and 10 percent swing."" Jack Nicklaus
""What invariably distinguishes a good player from a poor one is their respective address positions or setups.""David Leadbetter
""If you set up correctly, there's a good chance you'll hit a reasonable shot, even if you make a mediocre swing. If you set up to the ball poorly, you'll hit a lousy shot even if you make the greatest swing in the world.""Jack Nicklaus
From day one these informed words were the driving force in our pursuit to develop a training aid unlike any other out there - and the TALON was born.

How does it work?








1. 
SPINE ANGLE

Our wireless back unit measures your spine angle. 

2. SHAFT ANGLE
The digital display unit attaches to the grip of your club and measures the
club shaft angle. 

3. CLUB SHAFT TO SPINE ANGLE
Our clever technology syncs and works out the club shaft to spine angle. 

4. ROTATION ANGLE
With the digital display unit pre-aligned, we measure and display the rotation
angle of the club face.
 
Comfortable and adjustable Talon belt designed to support the back unit

How you set up and address the ball is fundamental to every golfer’s game, from beginners to professionals. However, teaching, learning and replicating the optimum set up for golfing success has previously relied upon basic unreliable methods which cannot be quantified or accurately replicated. For example, relying on 'feel', looking in a mirror and retrospective video analysis. 
We have developed a revolutionary new training aid that gives you real-time visual feedback on your golf stance and angles of address. TALON removes the guess work and gives you all the critical information you need to set up to the ball with the same posture, every time – improving muscle memory, consistency and optimum performance. 


Using our simple alignment tool, line
up and attach the TALON gripper to any club you would like to use. The TALON digital display unit simply clicks
in and out of the gripper, allowing you to easily switch the unit between
different clubs you may be practising with. When you are not using the TALON a
smart rubber cap fits over the gripper protecting it in all weathers, meaning
you can leave the gripper in place at all times.
The digital display and back unit are
charged via a USB connection and provide 8 hours of continuous use, plenty of
time for a leisurely 18 holes or some hard core practice on the range.


What great Indiegogo EXCLUSIVES are up for grabs? 

We've been fortunate enough to have partnered up with some fantastic individuals and companies within the game to offer some amazing limited edition product exclusively to the Indiegogo community. Take a look below at some of the great perks we have on offer.

<p>The inPocket Pro socks are the world's most comfortable, versatile and supportive football socks.

<strong>Inside po</strong><strong>cket to hold a shin guard </strong>
</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>With the <strong>inPocket Pro socks</strong>,<strong> </strong>you do not need tape or strap to keep shin guards up, nor do you need to pull them up repeatedly during the game. These seamless double-layer knitted socks work with an <strong>inside pocket to hold your shin guard securely in place </strong>by the action of graduated compression of the outer layer. This enhances your comfort, while <strong>maintaining</strong> <strong>leg protection</strong> and <strong>preventing strangulation</strong> of your calves. The pocket is not restrictive to a certain size, as the inventive pocket is suitable for any length of your shin guards.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Graduated compression for improved performance and recovery</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Compression varies from 17 to 22 mmHg (conform to BS6612:1985), <strong>exerting the highest pressure at the ankle, and decreasing in intensity towards the calf. </strong>This compression assists the veins in pushing de-oxygenated blood back to the heart and, therefore, it <strong>improves blood and oxygen circ</strong>ulation in your feet, ankles and legs and <strong>reduces muscle vibration, soreness and fatigue</strong> for enhanced performance and quick recovery.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Special composition for extra comfort and breathability</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Polyamide microfibers</strong> are lightweight, hypoallergenic, super-absorbent and provides a <strong>pleasant softness sensation </strong>to your skin. The yarn structure is porous enough to let the skin breathe, while offering high strength properties. Fibers are engineered to keep you <strong>cool and dry</strong> by moving moisture away from your feet, and <strong>comfortable</strong> by offering outstanding quality, and performance.<strong> </strong></p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1539471686/m13iehfj9tb8z5gn6pis.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>3D knit structure for higher breathability and reduced risk of slips</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The foot part of the socks was engineered as a 3D knit structure for ultralight ventilation that <strong>enhances breathability and promotes quick elimination of moisture</strong>.</p>
<p>3D cushioned lines were knitted in the bottom of the foot to increase friction thus <strong>prevent your foot from</strong> <strong>slipping inside your boots</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Cushioned regions </strong>were selectively placed in high-impact areas of the foot sole to provide <strong>maximum comfort</strong> and <strong>help prevent blisters</strong>.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>You hardly need a pen and pad for this, as the product is created coherently for your convenience.</p>
<p>1.            You put your inPocket Pro sock on one foot and pull it up (if you are the superstitious type, then obviously your preferred foot first)</p>
<p>2.           Simply place your shin guard in the pocket.</p>
<p>3.           Repeat process for the second foot.  </p>
<p>….and that’s all!</p>
<p><br/>Time to play the beautiful game in the knowledge that you’ll never have to waste time and money again to buy extra sleeves or tape. Now, focus on the match.</p>

</div></div>","The inPocket Pro socks are the world's most comfortable, versatile and supportive football socks. Developed with an inside shin guard pocket and produced from high performance fibers with graduated compression, these socks provide a pleasant softness sensation and revive your tired legs, while allowing you to maintain your legs protected from injuries.

 




Inside pocket to hold a shin guard 

 
With the inPocket Pro socks, you do not need tape or strap to keep shin guards up, nor do you need to pull them up repeatedly during the game. These seamless double-layer knitted socks work with an inside pocket to hold your shin guard securely in place by the action of graduated compression of the outer layer. This enhances your comfort, while maintaining leg protection and preventing strangulation of your calves. The pocket is not restrictive to a certain size, as the inventive pocket is suitable for any length of your shin guards.
 

 
Graduated compression for improved performance and recovery
 
Compression varies from 17 to 22 mmHg (conform to BS6612:1985), exerting the highest pressure at the ankle, and decreasing in intensity towards the calf. This compression assists the veins in pushing de-oxygenated blood back to the heart and, therefore, it improves blood and oxygen circulation in your feet, ankles and legs and reduces muscle vibration, soreness and fatigue for enhanced performance and quick recovery.

Special composition for extra comfort and breathability
 
Polyamide microfibers are lightweight, hypoallergenic, super-absorbent and provides a pleasant softness sensation to your skin. The yarn structure is porous enough to let the skin breathe, while offering high strength properties. Fibers are engineered to keep you cool and dry by moving moisture away from your feet, and comfortable by offering outstanding quality, and performance.  
 
3D knit structure for higher breathability and reduced risk of slips
 
The foot part of the socks was engineered as a 3D knit structure for ultralight ventilation that enhances breathability and promotes quick elimination of moisture.
3D cushioned lines were knitted in the bottom of the foot to increase friction thus prevent your foot from slipping inside your boots.
Cushioned regions were selectively placed in high-impact areas of the foot sole to provide maximum comfort and help prevent blisters.
 

 
You hardly need a pen and pad for this, as the product is created coherently for your convenience.
1.            You put your inPocket Pro sock on one foot and pull it up (if you are the superstitious type, then obviously your preferred foot first)
2.           Simply place your shin guard in the pocket.
3.           Repeat process for the second foot.  
….and that’s all!
Time to play the beautiful game in the knowledge that you’ll never have to waste time and money again to buy extra sleeves or tape. Now, focus on the match.
 

 

 
Sports

The inPocket Pro Socks are for football athletes of all levels, gender or type: professional, amateur, student or novice, male or female, association football or indoor soccer.
 

 
They are recommended for any football player, who wants to up her/his performance and comfort, get that extra edge needed to outperform herself/himself and reach higher achievements in game.
 

 
Sports fascination with fashion 
More than just a football garment, the inPocket Pro socks can be worn in many different activities as walking, running, or even while resting and recovering. Graduated compression improves blood and oxygen circulation, alleviates swelling and inflammation, reduces muscle soreness and fatigue, speeds up your muscle recovery and relieves tired legs. Therefore, inPocket Pro socks are also a great garment for you to practice light fitness, recreational and relaxation activities with fashion.
 

 
We have been working diligently on this remarkable product for about a year now. We have developed dozens of prototypes that were meticulously investigated in terms of comfort, design, effectiveness, freedom of movement, suitability and quality by our team of designers, engineers, and doctors specialised in biomechanics.
 


 
Throughout both the testing and validation processes, volunteer professional football athletes had accustomed themselves to the product and were able to give their candid verdict. Alterations and adaptations were driven by our findings, and subsequently they matched the athletes’ recommendations on what they consider integral for enhanced performance and comfort.
 

 

 

 
Portugal is known by quality and innovation on textile. “Made in Portugal” is on the rise.
Our socks are designed and manufactured locally in Portugal. We account for a highly collaborative and innovative Portuguese textile company. A company that has an extensive experience and expertise in developing graduated compression garments for elite athletes, that is also one of the most experienced and innovative textile companies in Europe.

It is certified with the Portuguese Standard for Research, Development and Innovation (NP 4457) and was distinguished as a SME Leader. All products comply with medical devices Directive 93/42 EEC requirements and further amendments.

Graduated compression was tested and approved in compliance with the British Standard (BS6612:1985).

<p>¡Hola! Soy David García, piloto de trial en bici mexicano, llevo cerca de 13 años en este bello deporte, soy uno de los principales promotores en México y a lo largo de mi carrera he hecho un gran número de exhibiciones y competencias en todo México.

Resumen

¡Hola! Soy David García, piloto de trial en bici mexicano, llevo cerca de 13 años en este bello deporte, soy uno de los principales promotores en México y a lo largo de mi carrera he hecho un gran número de exhibiciones y competencias en todo México. Soy 4 veces campeón nacional y tengo un récord mundial en ascenso de escaleras, siendo yo, el único mexicano que ha competido fuera del país.
Este año he decidido llegar al siguiente nivel, voy a romper un récord mundial subiendo el mayor número de escaleras en bicicleta, ¿pero, por qué lo hago? Me gusta inspirar a otros, el trial es un gran deporte pero muy pocas personas saben acerca de este, al hacer esto me gustaría ver a más pilotos iniciarse y demostrar a las personas en general que sólo si tienes el coraje suficiente puedes lograr lo que sea que te propones, sin importar que sea, quiero inspirar a otros a que salgan de su zona de confort y hagan algo increíble.
La persona que me enseñó este deporte cambió mi vida, con el simple hecho de enseñarme un deporte, así que, si puedo inspirar aunque sea a una sola persona todo esto valdrá la pena.
¿Qué necesito y qué obtienes?Este récord sería imposible sin todo el equipo de trabajo que está a mi lado así como el equipo que utilizo durante los entrenamientos.

Summary Hey there!

I am 4 times national champion, world record holder and the only rider who has competed outside the country.
Today I'm taking this to the next level, I'm going to establish a new world record by climbing steps by bike, but why am I doing this? Well.. I like to inspire people and bike trials is such a great sport but nobody knows about it, by doing this I'm expecting to see more and more riders and show people that only if you have enough courage and will they can achieve anything they want, I want to encourage others to push themselves.
The person who introduced me to the sport changed my life, so if I can do the same and inspire for at least one person it will all be worth it.
What I need and what you get
 This record will be impossible without all the team that is working with me and the equipment I need for training sessions and the event.

In return you can get a personalized jersey of the event, the same one I'll be using! :)   The impact
People are awesome but they are afraid of doing new things or just don't know what to do with their lives, that's why I want to inspire people to go out and challenge themselves.

This is my first time doing this type of challenge but the ultimate goal is to climb a building in Dubai, that's where you can find the tallest buildings on earth.
    Risks and challenges  The challenges I'm facing is that even though I'm 4 times national champion I only have a couple sponsors, which are good to start the project but not enough to expand the event to its fullest.

<p>Hello, my name is Jamie Thompson, and I'm a <a href=""http://www.mass.gov/dpl/boards/mt/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">state-licensed massage therapist</a> in Massachusetts (license number <a href=""http://license.reg.state.ma.us/public/pubLicenseQ.asp?board_code=MT&amp;type_class=MT&amp;license_number=000009356&amp;color=red&amp;lb=MT"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">MT-9356-MT</a>). I graduated from <a href=""http://www.cortiva.com/locations/boston-massage-school/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Cortiva Institute - Boston</a> in July 2009 after completing a twelve-month, 750-hour program leading to a diploma in professional massage therapy. While enrolled at Cortiva as a full-time student (attending classes three days per week), I also worked part-time (twenty hours per week) as the church administrator for <a href=""http://www.firstchurchsomerville.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">First Church Somerville UCC</a> (my ""day job,"" which I still have), continued to raise my twelve-year-old daughter, Sophia, as a single parent, and completed a two-year term on the <a href=""http://www.onein3boston.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">ONEin3 Boston</a> Mayor's Advisory Council, where I served as chairperson of the ""Young Families"" subcommittee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now I'm the self-employed sole proprietor of <a href=""http://www.redlotusmassage.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Red Lotus Massage and Bodywork</a>, a part-time massage therapy business which I founded this past fall in Boston's Brighton Center neighborhood. I'm also a professional member of the <a href=""http://amtamassage.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">American Massage Therapy Association</a>, and have earned over one hundred hours of continuing education from <a href=""http://www.upledger.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">The Upledger Institute</a> (CranioSacral Therapy I and II), <a href=""http://www.zerobalancing.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Zero Balancing Health Association</a> (Core Zero Balancing I and II and Northeast Conference and Review Day), and <a href=""http://thebodyworkeducationproject.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">The Bodywork Education Project</a>. I'm pursuing certification in both CranioSacral Therapy and Zero Balancing and am also studying for the national certification exam offered by the <a href=""http://www.ncbtmb.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">National Certification Board for Therapeutic Massage and Bodywork</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I first became interested in massage therapy - and complementary and integrative medicine in general - after suffering for years from chronic migraine and tension headaches. Massage therapy, combined with other holistic therapies such as acupuncture, yoga and qigong, and mindfulness-based stress reduction, helped alleviate my symptoms and decreased both the severity and frequency of my headaches. Based on my own experiences with massage, I decided to embark upon a new career as a massage therapist myself, to help others suffering from chronic stress and pain. </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Massage therapy has worked for me, and I've seen it work for others, too. Caring, compassionate, nurturing touch has a profoundly calming and relaxing effect on a person, reducing stress and anxiety and increasing one's physical, mental, and spiritual health and wellbeing. In addition to being scientifically proven to help with physical ailments such as headaches, back pain, cancer, arthritis, etc., massage therapy is also beneficial to children and adults suffering from AD/HD, depression, trauma, and other mental, emotional, and psychospiritual conditions.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Sadly, however, many of the people who could benefit from massage therapy the most are those least able to afford it. As someone who comes from a working class background and is a low-income earner herself, I am highly sensitive to the economic realities of this industry. Red Lotus Massage and Bodywork is committed to making massage therapy affordable and accessible to all - regardless of socioeconomic status, sexual orientation, ethnicity, etc., as stated in the <a href=""http://www.redlotusmassage.com/mission.html/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">mission and vision statement</a> - and to transforming the world through the healing power of touch, one person at a time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While Red Lotus is not officially incorporated as a nonprofit, it has always operated as one. Motivated by values of lovingkindness and sustainability rather than greed and profits-over-people, Red Lotus seeks to bring massage therapy to underserved populations through <a href=""http://redlotusmassage.com/philanthropy.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">volunteer work</a> in the greater Boston community; generous <a href=""http://www.redlotusmassage.com/discounts.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">discounts</a> to students, senior citizens, bodyworkers, and professional caregivers (teachers, ministers, nurses, social workers, and others); <em>pro bono</em> sessions to those experiencing extreme hardship; and, in lieu of a traditional sliding fee scale, a special <a href=""http://www.redlotusmassage.com/discounts.html#goodkarma"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">""Good Karma"" pay-what-you-can rate</a> to those earning at or below 175% of the <a href=""http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">federal poverty guidelines</a>. This unwavering commitment to serving others and giving back to the community is what sets Red Lotus apart from other bodyworkers and small business owners out there.</p>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>This is my first-ever campaign here on IndieGoGo, and I have set a goal of $500. The funds raised will be used to purchase an <a href=""http://www.massagetables.com/massage-chair/portal-pro.asp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Oakworks Portal Pro massage chair, carrying case, and sternum pad</a>, a package which currently retails for $514 ($489 for the chair and carrying case, plus $25 for the sternum pad). Although cheaper massage chairs do exist, based on reviews from other massage therapists, recommendations from Cortiva instructors and others in the field, and my own experiences with the Oakworks brand, the Portal Pro is an excellent investment because it is a high-quality, durable chair that should last for years and provide superior client comfort. Other professional massage chairs (such as the <a href=""http://www.earthlite.com/portable-massage-chairs/avila-ii-portable-massage-chair.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">Earthlite Avila II</a>) are within the same price range, so this goal is a reasonable one. If I am able to purchase the chair for less through another vendor, then any remaining funds would be used to buy face cradle covers, business cards, and other marketing materials and supplies. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Owning a portable massage chair will allow me to grow my small business and fulfill my mission of making massage affordable and accessible to all by offering seated massage at my Brighton office and volunteering at local nonprofit organizations and events. A massage chair is much easier to transport than a table (especially for someone like me who doesn't own a car and commutes via <a href=""http://www.mbta.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">public transportation</a>), and will allow me to offer massage in venues where it's simply not feasible to bring a regular massage table. Furthermore, new clients who may be initially apprehensive about receiving a full massage treatment (such as survivors of sexual abuse and domestic violence, who tend to have boundary issues regarding touch) may be more receptive to seated chair massage sessions, which are shorter in duration and performed with the client fully clothed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Regardless of whether my goal is met or not, I will continue to do everything I can to make massage and bodywork accessible and affordable to all. But your donation - of any monetary amount, large or small - will help make this vision a reality today rather than tomorrow. Your generosity will go a long way towards helping my small business's outreach and philanthropic efforts succeed. Everyone, regardless of their income level or background, deserves access to healthcare services that lead to greater vitality and wellbeing in body, mind, and spirit. Everyone, not just those who are affluent, should have an opportunity to receive massage and bodywork services and experience their transformative and healing effects. </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Sonny, I'm currently serving as a Marine Officer on Camp Pendleton, California. A few years ago, I came across a book called: ""It Happened On The Way To War - A Marine's Path To Peace"" that profoundly impacted my life. It was a story of a fellow Marine Officer - Rye Barcott, who launched a non-profit initiative to prevent violence by organizing an inter-ethnic sports programs in Kibera, Africa's largest slum of almost a million inhabitants where the average person subsists on merely $1 per day.</p>
<p>Rye developed lifelong relationships with some of the Kenyans that he met there, and partnering with local Kiberans and focused on empowering local leaders to make decisions to improve their community instead of guiding it with a ""Western hand"". Over the years, Rye's modest initiative has now blossomed into a fully fledged non-profit that operates a clinic that is partnered with the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and serves over 41,000 patients annually.</p>
Rye's story had a profound impact on my life because it compelled me to take action. Having lived in South Africa for six years, I've witnessed the heartbreaking effects of abject destitution as a child, and always vowed that I would do something about it. Now is the time to take the first steps!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This May, I will be traveling to Kibera to volunteer at the Tabitha Clinic. It will be an opportunity for me to live amongst the people, and have a small taste of the extreme deprivation that Kiberans suffer through every day. However, the last thing they need is another rich American ""humanitarian tourist"" who is going to come in, journal about the conditions, take photos with children, and go about his life.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>No! This is an opportunity to make a lasting impact! While I was in Afghanistan, I corresponded briefly by email with Rye and members of his organization - Carolina for Kibera (named after Rye's alma mater, UNC-Chapel Hill). Recently, I asked CFK if there was anything I could do, anything that I could bring from the United States that would be of use to them. They provided me with the Tabitha Clinic's Wish List. I promised them that somehow, someway, I'm going to make this happen to the utmost of my abilities, but I'm going to need your help! <br/><br/>

<h3>Hi, my name is Maria Musarella. I was an ocullar geneticist who researched cures for children's eye diseases. You can google me to see all the research I have done to help children with eye diseases causing them to go blind. In 2002, I had to retire because of Stage 3 Thyroid cancer. Radiation caused my teeth to fall out and dental repair is expensive.  I also have Multiple system atrophy, a rare degenerative brain disease, which has left me in a wheelchair and bedridden most of the time, but my upper body strength is normal, allowing me to hit golf balls. Golf is my greatest pleasure in life but I'm not allowed to go on the golf course with the wheelchair.  The paramobile would allow me to go on the course and play in a standing position. I also suffer from diabetes and bipolar disease. I'm on 16 medications. The funds  would help with dental repair, medications and the paramobile which would allow me to play golf.  I need about $40,000 for my dental work and to buy a paramobile.  Thank you for your help!</h3>

<h3>Hello my name is Nancy Sutter,</h3>
<p>I am a mother of 1 and about to be a grandmother of 2. For the last 25 years I have been an visual artist.</p>
<p>Quite recently, in fact on April 27 2012, I had received confirmation from my neuro surgeon, that I had a tumor behind my left eye.</p>
<p>This tumor is is encroaching on my optic nerve and there is a <strong>high possibilty that I will</strong> <strong>lose the use of that eye</strong>. That's the bad news....the good news is that he can remove it, saving my sight.</p>
<p>I am unable to get insurance to take care of this as, I have an pre-existing condition. 7 years ago I survived breast cancer. For me to get new insurance, I would be on 1 year waiting period....</p>
<p><strong>I can't afford to wait, I need to take care of this right away.</strong></p>
<p>What I am asking for is the <em>deposit</em> I require to make this happen. The total bill for the hospital, doctor, labs, assistants, and the whole works is $58,000.</p>
<p>I require $27,000 to complete the operation and the hospital stay. Once I have recovered from this, I will go back to work....and continue to create to pay off the balance.</p>
<p><strong>I know that I am asking SO MUCH.....but I want to see my grandchildren and I want to continue to create. I am 52 and don't believe I am ready for the darken room.</strong></p>
<p>If you can't donate, please spread the word......</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My brother has been struggling with diabetes all his life.</p>
<p>Like many Americans he has worked for several companies doing the best job he can at everything he does.  Unfortunately his diabetes limits his performance some in his case.  He recently last week fell very ill and went to urgent care.  The rushed him to the hospital and put him on an insulin drip to get his sugar levels normal and then tried to find out what was wrong with him.  After several blood tranfusions and a myriad of medical procedures including slicing open his leg to let the infection drain they discovered that he has the infamous flesh eating bacteria attacking his leg.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The doctors are not optimistic about saving his leg and are worried about saving him!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I work for the US Army Corps of Engineers and am deployed to Afghanistan.  My mother, Father and Sister are with him in Buffalo, NY.  The most I can do right now is send money to help cover his medical bills and household expenses.  I don't know how much this will all cost but and asking for $100K in donations to get started.</p>

When we take it for granted that it is the bath itself that recharges us, we find out that the daily ritual after your bath actually plays a much more significant role. In this ritual, you are with your bath towel, as always.</p><p> </p><p>However, the towel industry has not really changed across the past century. We are still in the restless journey of searching for the right bath towel, facing an ocean of towels with unequal and hard-to-expect qualities.</p><p> </p><p>Kosmu is changing the picture by tackling the “Towel Dilemma” with science. Voluminousness and quick-dry are not necessarily contradictory.

They soak up MORE water and FASTER. The open weaves maximize surface exposure for airflow. BREATHABILITY guaranteed.    A dry towel is a clean towel. The airy waffles effectively prevent the multiplication of odor caused by bacteria and fungus. You will never reach out to a wet, musty towel after a shower anymore.     While the waffle structure intrinsically maximizes surface exposure for airflow for guaranteed breathability, allowing the towel to dry itself out quickly, we have fundamentally improved the performance of Kosmu Towel with advanced science and technology.Kosmu Towel employs an advanced spinning technology that can store air across the cotton threads. Dissolving the pre-woven hydrosoluble fibers enveloped by cotton, Aerocore Technology® helps create tubular cotton fibers, making for 160% higher water absorbency, 2X speed to dry, 70% Less shedding rate than the industry standard.     Kosmu towel is crafted of the actual world’s most optimized innovation of towel fabrics, a combination of 70% of extra fine cotton (with an extremely long fiber length of 37mm and a world-best 48.3 g/.tex fibers strength) and 30% premium natural silk ( 25 MM and 3.5CN/d).   We partnered with the affiliated manufacturer of Japan’s largest towel manufacturing and distribution group –Towel Museum (タオル美術館グループ), which has built long-term partnerships with leading global brands such as JILL STUART, ROYAL COPENHAGEN, MINTON, OROBIANCO, Adidas, Disney, etc. Most of our manufacturer’s portfolio sells through high-end Japanese marketplace: 90% of its product mix is sold to premium department stores in Japan through local sales agents, e.g.Takashimaya, Isetan, Mitsukoshi, Hankyu, Daimaru; and the rest of its businesses include sales in overseas business. It provides both assurance and quality in all its products at prices that meet customer needs by full management of product quality in all states of the manufacturing process.    Over a year ago we began an ambitious journey to transform the way we refresh ourselves in our bathroom. When we take it for granted that it is the bath itself that recharges us, we find out that the daily ritual after your bath actually plays a much more significant role. In this ritual, you are with your bath towel, as always. However, the towel industry has not really changed across the past century. We are still in the restless journey of searching for the right bath towel, facing an ocean of towels with unequal and hard-to-expect qualities. Kosmu is changing the picture by tackling the “Towel Dilemma” with science. Voluminousness and quick-dry are not necessarily contradictory. After many studies, design iterations, and prototypes, we finally create the waffle-shaped cotton-silk towel which solves the “Towel Dilemma” with design, technology, and material innovation. We are now in the final stage of development. Together, we can improve how people recharge themselves with the daily bath ritual. With your support, we will be able to kick off production.                Created with diatomaceous earth, Kosmu Earth Mat dries instantly under your feet, keeping your bathroom clean and odor-free with thoughtful design. Diatomaceous earth, or grass of the sea, is a natural mineral that occurred from the fossilized remains of aquatic organisms.

<p>For most of us, air purifiers and aroma-diffusers have become an inseparable part of our daily lives. What many don’t know is that the majority of diffusers rely on heat and ultra-sonic vibrations to disperse the essential oils. Such methods damage the purity of the essential oil being used. As a result, the full benefits of the oil are substantially decreased and the original scent is also greatly altered. Considering the expensive cost of most essential oils, and how the oils are wasted to a certain extent, we see this as consumers being ripped off, costing them time and money.</p>

<p>Water mist diffusers work by changing the molecular structures of essential oils, due to the process of heating the essential oils. This causes the therapeutic benefits of the essential oil to be decreased, or even lost completely.</p>

<p>Ultrasonic diffusers work by diluting essential oils with water. One disadvantage of this type of diffuser is how the dilution of the essential oil also greatly affects the benefits of the oil. Another downside is how the water mist produced from the diffuser increases your indoor humidity; high humidity causes your wooden furniture to absorb moisture and deteriorate, while your leather and metal furniture would also be more prone to corrosion.</p>

<p>Currently, almost all diffusers sold on the market damage the purity of the essential oils, dispersing unwanted substances into the air.  The unnecessary problems brought by such diffusers are bound to create frustration for most consumers. And there hasn’t been a product that solves all these problems, not until today. Now, we’ve created it.</p>

<p>The Thuja Plicata trees flourish in the forests and mountainsides and have been named as the Tree of Life by local Indigenous peoples. For hundreds of years, the Indigenous peoples have used the leaves of Thuja Plicata through the ancient methods of fumigation and have reaped both the physical and mental healing benefits of the tree. Those with rhinitis and asthma have experienced major physical improvements from the usage of the leaves, and Thuja Plicata has also been cherished for its antibacterial properties.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>In the past few years, the Canadian research team of OLOR.COCO has been working in collaboration with the Indigenous peoples to uncover the mystery behind the Tree of Life. After an extensive period of scientific research, we have not only discovered the healing properties of the tree, but we’ve discovered that the essential oil extracted from Thuja Plicata is quite distinct and unique from other essential oils.</p>

<p> </p>
</div></div></div></div>
<p>Any type of water mist diffusers or ultrasonic diffusers are incapable of being used with the Thuja Plicata essential oil, as the molecular structures would be damaged in the process, causing the antibacterial and soothing properties to be lost. This is why it is difficult for this essential oil to be used with any other diffuser or purifier on the market.</p>

In times like these, our product can provide you with the protection you need.
 

 

 


 
For most of us, air purifiers and aroma-diffusers have become an inseparable part of our daily lives. What many don’t know is that the majority of diffusers rely on heat and ultra-sonic vibrations to disperse the essential oils. Such methods damage the purity of the essential oil being used. As a result, the full benefits of the oil are substantially decreased and the original scent is also greatly altered. Considering the expensive cost of most essential oils, and how the oils are wasted to a certain extent, we see this as consumers being ripped off, costing them time and money.
 

 
Water mist diffusers work by changing the molecular structures of essential oils, due to the process of heating the essential oils. This causes the therapeutic benefits of the essential oil to be decreased, or even lost completely.
 

 
Ultrasonic diffusers work by diluting essential oils with water. One disadvantage of this type of diffuser is how the dilution of the essential oil also greatly affects the benefits of the oil. Another downside is how the water mist produced from the diffuser increases your indoor humidity; high humidity causes your wooden furniture to absorb moisture and deteriorate, while your leather and metal furniture would also be more prone to corrosion.
 

 
Traditional air purifiers are big and bulky, taking up a lot of space in your household. They also require you to clean and change the filters every month and that may be time-consuming for many busy people.
 

 
Currently, almost all diffusers sold on the market damage the purity of the essential oils, dispersing unwanted substances into the air.  The unnecessary problems brought by such diffusers are bound to create frustration for most consumers. And there hasn’t been a product that solves all these problems, not until today. Now, we’ve created it.
 

 
 

 
The design of our purifier was inspired by Mother Nature itself, and we’ve ensured that our product satisfies the needs of our customers to the greatest extent.
 

 
Note: The OLOR.COCO air purifier and diffuser is suitable for all essential oils, including those from other brands. Our product works to ensure improved benefits of the essential oils used, as our design causes no dilution and damage to the essential oils.
 

 
Whether you’re working by day or resting by night, our purifier works 24/7 to protect you and your family.
 

 

 

 

 

 
Healing energies are hidden within the leaves, but a way to deliver the therapeutic powers has never been discovered…until now.
 

 
The Thuja Plicata trees flourish in the forests and mountainsides and have been named as the Tree of Life by local Indigenous peoples. For hundreds of years, the Indigenous peoples have used the leaves of Thuja Plicata through the ancient methods of fumigation and have reaped both the physical and mental healing benefits of the tree. Those with rhinitis and asthma have experienced major physical improvements from the usage of the leaves, and Thuja Plicata has also been cherished for its antibacterial properties.
 

 
In the past few years, the Canadian research team of OLOR.COCO has been working in collaboration with the Indigenous peoples to uncover the mystery behind the Tree of Life. After an extensive period of scientific research, we have not only discovered the healing properties of the tree, but we’ve discovered that the essential oil extracted from Thuja Plicata is quite distinct and unique from other essential oils.


 

Any type of water mist diffusers or ultrasonic diffusers are incapable of being used with the Thuja Plicata essential oil, as the molecular structures would be damaged in the process, causing the antibacterial and soothing properties to be lost. This is why it is difficult for this essential oil to be used with any other diffuser or purifier on the market.
 

 

 



Check this short hands-on review made by Sanders Crew. Thanks so much for their work!
 


 


 
For every 1mL of our essential oil extracted, 24,000 leaves are required to be processed. Needless to say, this is an extraordinarily precious essential oil and luckily, a little goes a long way.
 

 

 

 
OLOR.COCO delivers the highest purification performance with the lowest consumption. Every 5 mL of the essential oil lasts for up to 30 days of use. This means you get the cleanest air while saving money on refill bills.
 

 

 
OLOR.COCO has successfully overcome the series of problems caused by other types of diffusers and purifiers, such as damage caused to the molecular structures of the essential oil, which also causes decreased benefits of the oil.
 

 

 
 

 
Eliminates 99.9% of germs
Scientifically proven by the BSL-3 laboratory and other respected organizations, our product is proven to be 99.9% effective at eliminating viruses, bacteria, fungi and germs in the air, as well as surfaces exposed in the air.

<p>Nixie tubes were introduced in the mid-1950s for numerals display, but soon fell out of favor because of the new LED display tech. As time pass, the bright warm orange glow is becoming a legendary symbol for the retro-tech. However, they are quite fragile, short life, and require sophisticated maintenance. Nextube is using the modern IPS screens to re-create the vintage nostalgic look.</p>

Inspired by the 50s-70s soviet Nixie tube clock, Nextube uses modern IPS screens to revive the beautiful warm orange glow of old tech, at the same time, shows you key metrics of modern life. You can use it to know the time, arrange your schedule, check the weather, track social media performance, visualize your favorite music, and light up your space. 


Nixie tubes were introduced in the mid-1950s for numerals display, but soon fell out of favor because of the new LED display tech. As time pass, the bright warm orange glow is becoming a legendary symbol for the retro-tech. However, they are quite fragile, short life, and require sophisticated maintenance. Nextube is using the modern IPS screens to re-create the vintage nostalgic look.



This isn’t just some exercise in nostalgia, the digital IPS screens can bring endless possibilities. Select a place, set your time, and you’re ready to enjoy the beauty of this ultra-modern timepiece.

We offer global shipping to anywhere in the world, and we've cooperated with carriers like FedEx, UPS, DHL, and USPS. Please note that the price doesn't include shipping costs, taxes or additional duty. COVID-19 is still delaying international shipping in many places, but things are better now, and we hope that by the time we start shipping, the delivery time can be back to normal. We will update you with the whole shipping process continuously.


Rotrics team is formed by a group of experienced engineers and designers who have a passion for innovative desktop electronics, robotics, and gadgets. Back in 2019, our first creation DexArm, the all-in-one modular desktop robot arm, was brought to life by over 1,613 backers. With the love and support we have received, we successfully delivered all DexArms to our backers during the pandemic, and we are still supporting our community and improving it further.

Our story with Nextube starts with our electronic engineer, James. He is so obsessed with all kinds of old tech gadgets, and the glow of nixie tubes holds a special place in his heart, it's his dream to build one by himself, he shared the idea with the team, and we thought, why not create the world's first hackable nixie clock to revive the beautiful warm glow, and at the same time, tells you key metrics for daily life. We are ready to go now, and here we invite you to join us to start this journey.  


As engineers, we love the journey to design things. But the process of creating new products isn't easy, especially when innovating new features, so we want to bring our Nextube ideas and designs in front of the Indiegogo community. We believe with the feedbacks from this awesome community we can get more inspiration and co-create with backers. We look forward to having you as our co-creator, and let's make Nextube a better display for everyone.",45.0,2,"2 Campaigns

Grabbing that doggy doo with hands
Feeling the nasty smell as it hits our nose
Walking around with the poop bag in hand before *finally* finding a trash bin….
We’ve all been there. But who said it has to be this poopy way?             No more grabbing with your hands.Hands off that nasty poo! Pupsule removes your dog’s mess without you getting into the poopy business. Just pull the handle and watch it scoop the poop directly into the container. Smell-free, leak-proof, away from view.You no longer have to rush through finding a trash bin to dispose of that stinky leftover. Pupsule stores your dog’s poop inside a leak- and smelly-proof container preventing any spillovers. Compact and light to carry around.Your dog loves giving you poopy surprises in public. Pupsule is ultralight and compact to take around with you. Use the lanyard to hang it from your shoulder, strap it around your wrist or clip it to your dog’s leash. Pupsule works everywhere from tall grass and gravel to concrete and even snow [it’s coming!?️]. Use it in your backyard, on the way to the grocery store, or while having your morning jog with your dog. No day is like the other when it comes to poop. We get it. So no matter where you find your dog on the poopy spectrum on a given day, know that Pupsule’s in control. With its ergonomic design, it can store 1, 2 and even more poops at a time freeing up more hands from the poopy carry. Made of the premium ABS and PP plastic, Pupsule is made to last for years. Thanks to this unique mix, it can withstand fairly heavy poops, while still being lightweight to take around with you… at an added weight of a smartphone! With its 6 claws, Pupsule gets the scoop at 360-degree, making sure no poop will slip away. Capture all that poo with just a flick of a wrist. Pupsule features a built-in bag dispenser, so you don’t have to tuck bags into your pockets. Just pull one out from the inside when the poop time comes.Covering Pupsule with a bag also means it will always stay clean, even after years of messes. Whether you have a German Shepherd or a little Chihuahua, you’re sure to find your perfect Pupsule. Pupsule effectively handles poop of all sizes and shapes. With its wide span, Pupsule will get all that doodie inside in under a second, without you getting into awkward positions or having to walk around with a stinky poop bag in your hand. Pull the handle as hard or light as you wish to regulate just how tight the claws shut. Unlike most pooper scoopers, Pupsule doesn’t gradually loosen up over time. Apply some tension to quickly change the period and target the poop for perfect capture. Pupsule comes with 10 rolls of biodegradable and compostable bags that decompose along with the poop after you dispose of them. With 20 bags in each roll, that’s 200 bags into Pupsule and out of landfills and oceans.  Can we use regular bags with Pupsule?Yes, Pupsule is designed to fit a standard bag roll inside of its dispenser. However, depending on the chosen perk, we may provide 200 eco-friendly bags with each Pupsule unit that can last up to 6 months of use with Pupsule. The provided bags are also biodegradable, compostable and 100% leak-proof. I have a large dog, I think Pupsule can't handly my doggie's poo.We have tested Pupsule on many breeds, including some of the largest dogs like Great Dane. With its 6 inch wide opening, Pupsule can handle Great Dane’s poo easily! Tested! My dog poops many times during one walk. I think Pupsule can't handle multiple poops.Pupsule is effective even for picking up multiple poops of your dog during your walk.",65.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Please, pay attention: the shipping cost <strong>is not included in the pledge</strong> and will be charged after the campaign with the <strong>BackerKit pledge manager.</strong></p>
<p>To find out the shipping fee, please sum up the volume weight of the Map(s) in your pledge, and find the corresponding value in the table below. (It’s a bit more than the actual weight, but this is how shipping works.) </p>
<p>Please note, all prices are estimated, the exact shipping cost will depend on your country and exact items backed. </p>
<p><strong>Note, we count volume weight as it's higher than the actual weight.</strong></p>
<p><strong>For example, if you would like Xl maps + L map + 2 M maps, you just have to add the weight: 9,5 + 6,5 + 3x2 = 22 kg altogether. And Just find the right price in the table below.</strong></p>
<p>If you have selected a few Maps, the shipping cost will be lower, than if we send them one by one. If you want to buy push pins, simply add the cost of push pins to your pledge.</p>

Please, pay attention: the shipping cost is not included in the pledge and will be charged after the campaign with the BackerKit pledge manager.
To find out the shipping fee, please sum up the volume weight of the Map(s) in your pledge, and find the corresponding value in the table below. (It’s a bit more than the actual weight, but this is how shipping works.) 
Please note, all prices are estimated, the exact shipping cost will depend on your country and exact items backed. 
Note, we count volume weight as it's higher than the actual weight.
For example, if you would like Xl maps + L map + 2 M maps, you just have to add the weight: 9,5 + 6,5 + 3x2 = 22 kg altogether. And Just find the right price in the table below.
If you have selected a few Maps, the shipping cost will be lower, than if we send them one by one. If you want to buy push pins, simply add the cost of push pins to your pledge.

<p>Load dishes into Capsule, add detergent on the door, add water to the water tank. Select Wash or Eco, adjust the timing if needed with the +/- buttons, press play and your all set.</p>
<p>Capsule requires 5-10 grams or 0.18-0.35oz of detergent (powder/liquid/gel) for normal wash and eco wash. Small tablets equivalent to that quantity are available on the market as well. **Never use detergent made for manual washing**</p>
<p>An open receptacle will be added in the final product as part of the door with a mark for 5g and 10g  as to guide you on how much detergent you're adding.</p>

<p>Dishwashers come with so many programmes and buttons, but how many of those do we really use? We designed Capsule to be intuitive and easy to use. One button for normal wash, eco wash, fruit wash and UVC disinfection. If you need more/less washing power just increase the time with plus/minus buttons. Capsule will adapt temperature, water pressure and running time accordingly. Use less time for delicate items like wine glasses and more time for heavy soiled items like frying pans. Easy.</p>

<p>Capsule features two twin powerful sprayers that distribute water throughout the entire tub. The water jets will hit the dishes, bounce on the roof and hit the dishes again on its way down.</p>

</div></div>","It's time for a dishwasher that fits effortlessly into your lifestyle. Powered by Scottish spirit & our love for sustainability, Capsule was designed to have the smallest footprint on your countertop and the planet.
It also works with or without plumbing, so you can use it anywhere you like.

Capsule was created to address the needs of a modern household or office space. Small but mighty, with three powerful functionalities at its core, Capsule allows you to reclaim your time and use it for stuff that matters.  
 

Key Features


 

 

 







 

 
Capsule only takes 25cm/9.8in on your countertop and still it's big enough to wash all your dishes from a meal for 2. It's also big enough to wash large frying pans and chopping boards. We made no compromises on convenience.

see in action here: https://gph.is/g/ZWJBldd

Ideal for a small flat, office, RV, caravan, boat and studio.
 
Capsule was designed to complement the modern lifestyle. So can spend less time washing dishes and more time living your life.


Small and light, Capsule weighs only 10kg/22lb and bound to fit any lifestyle. Camping? Business trip? Going on holiday? Moving home? Capsule can be brought along with no hassle.

It's not just dishes that need washing. Love your greens, but hate the broccoli florets crumbling and getting stuck in your strainer? How many hours are wasted in frustration trying to wash sieves and colanders? With the Capsule, you can rinse your fruit and veg easily and thoroughly, with no mess.

Disinfect your phone, face masks, mail, keys, baby bottles... the list goes on. Capsule uses state-of-the-art UV-C disinfection, requiring zero water.

Simply select UV and press play. It is recommended 10 minutes for hard surfaces like phones and bottles and 30 minutes for paper and textiles. Capsule UV-C light uses LEDs with a wavelength of 265-275nm.

Capsule is probably one of the few appliances used for baby care that you will keep using way after the baby is not a baby anymore.


 
We recognised the need for a countertop dishwasher which isn't limited to side plates, cups, mugs, and other small items. Capsule is designed to fit larger items used in the kitchen on a daily basis:  dinner plates,  frying pans, chopping boards, baking pans and more.

Load dishes into Capsule, add detergent on the door, add water to the water tank. Select Wash or Eco, adjust the timing if needed with the +/- buttons, press play and your all set.
Capsule requires 5-10 grams or 0.18-0.35oz of detergent (powder/liquid/gel) for normal wash and eco wash. Small tablets equivalent to that quantity are available on the market as well. **Never use detergent made for manual washing**
An open receptacle will be added in the final product as part of the door with a mark for 5g and 10g  as to guide you on how much detergent you're adding.
 

 
Dishwashers come with so many programmes and buttons, but how many of those do we really use? We designed Capsule to be intuitive and easy to use. One button for normal wash, eco wash, fruit wash and UVC disinfection. If you need more/less washing power just increase the time with plus/minus buttons. Capsule will adapt temperature, water pressure and running time accordingly. Use less time for delicate items like wine glasses and more time for heavy soiled items like frying pans. Easy.

 

You can use Capsule straight out of the box. It comes with with 3L independent water tank for fresh washer.  After a cleaning cycle water can be drained onto the sink through the provided 1m hose. If you prefer, you can plumb it in.
 

 
How It Works
Capsule features two twin powerful sprayers that distribute water throughout the entire tub. The water jets will hit the dishes, bounce on the roof and hit the dishes again on its way down.

Capsule's form factor provides a tight space to improve air flow through each item and increase air velocity on each surface to accelerate the drying process.

Capsule has a power rating of 950W and heats up to  75ºC/167ºF for sanitising and drying.

By the time you finish, you no longer need to go back for second helpings. IGGI Bowl has already helped tons of people from serial-dieters, to diabetics and bariatric patients lose up to a pound a week by removing ~500 calories per day which is *1 pound of weight loss per week.(NOTE: Losing more than a pound a week is well-known to actually reduce overall weight loss and increase the chances you will abandon eating healthy by triggering ""Starvation Mode"".)  Katie used IGGI Bowl for a week in December 2020 and surprised herself. The portable, eco-friendly bowl uses food psychology and ‘Calorie Cloaking’ for effortless weight loss by tricking your brain into eating a third less than you normally would. Within a few weeks you will pay for the bowl as you reduce your daily intake and grocery shopping bills.IGGI’s beautiful, Japanese-inspired design makes eating a pleasure, and the unique false bottom causes your brain to see 33% more food than is actually there.Consistency is key to meeting your health goals, which is why IGGI Bowl is supported by a system called Meal Mindfulness™️ that helps you build healthy habits around eating, like eating slower and learning if you’re truly hungry.IGGI Bowl’s complete Meal Mindfulness System blends into your normal eating routine seamlessly so you’re able to build portion control habits through consistent use. It takes 66 days to solidify new habits, on average. IGGI will guide you through those first months until your new eating pattern transforms into permanent healthy eating habits!There’s no calorie counting or painful meal prep. Simply fill the bowl and enjoy every bite! IGGI Bowl is the most effective portion control system because it makes you eat less without even realizing it, using a method called Calorie Cloaking.This works because hunger and eating are guided by the more primitive part of your brain, known as the ‘animal brain’ (or the amygdala). The animal brain does not want you eating less—it wants to store up fat for the winter!A study in the National Library of Medicine proved that how much your brain thinks you’re eating, directly relates to how full you feel. The study showed two groups of people the ingredients of their fruit smoothie—one group was shown a smaller portion, the other a larger portion. Both groups consumed the same amount of smoothie and rated expected satiety (e.g. fullness) before and then 3 hours after enjoying the smoothie. The group shown the larger portion of ingredients rated ‘expected’ fullness significantly higher and reported feeling less hunger and more fullness 3 hours later!Every feature on IGGI Bowl was carefully chosen so you see more food than is actually there and feel more full as a result.IGGI’s false bottom removes 33% of space in the bowl. You see a satisfying full bowl of food, but due to the convex bottom, you eat a third less. It’s Calorie Cloaking at work!IGGI isn’t red just because of Japanese influence—studies have shown that eating from a red plate vs. a white plate reduces consumption by up to 22%.IGGI Bowl naturally has hard limits (the bowl rim), unlike portion control plates that can be piled high and still remain inside the portion dividers. The bowl never delivers more than 600 calories when you follow the IGGI guidelines or included recipes.If you think IGGI Bowl looks awfully big, then we’ve accomplished our goal! IGGI Bowl looks big so your brain sees more food than it’s eating—you feel the same fullness as you would after eating over-portioned meals. The convex bottom keeps the bowl looking full but ensures no more than 400-600 calories fit inside. The bowl is 19.5cm/7.7in which is .5cm smaller than the universal bowl size of 20cm. A removable divider splits your meal into four segments: vegetables, proteins, carbs and legumes. IGGI Bowl’s beaded walls hold the divider in place if you prefer your foods separated.Simply remove the divider and you have a healthy meal in a classy wooden bowl!Easily portion out food you want heated later or separate out foods that are more ""sloppy"" sothey don't affect other dry segments. Simply pop the segment you want heated in themicrowave at work, and then drop it back in the bowl to eat. The segments have (slightly) flatbottoms so the stand-up by themselves in the microwave or the oven.The food-grade silicone inserts are resistant up to 450°F (232°C), are easy to clean, and stayrelatively cool to touch.2 Pack: €6 (with 50% campaign discount) €12MSRP*Segment Inserts are expected to be available as add-ons post-campaignYour IGGI Bowl comes with 15 convenient recipe cards for each segment of the bowl designed by French Sustainable Cuisine Chefs!Choose 4 segment cards and a sauce mix and match for a complete IGGI Bowl meal, or supplement your own foods with IGGI Bowl segment recipes.IGGI Bowl makes eating every meal a pleasurable experience. No more multicolored eating trays or Tupperware-like portion containers. IGGI lets you eat with the grown-ups again!Our designers labored every curve and line of IGGI Bowl to bring you the world's first officially 'non-ugly' portion control bowl. The minimalist, Japanese-inspired design and Stoneware (ceramic) material gives you a sense of luxury with every bite. If only every bowl could be this beautiful *sigh*. IGGI Bowl isn’t just a bowl. It's a system called Meal Mindfulness that was developed with great care over 12 months in conjunction with nutrition experts, dietitians, mindful eating experts, sustainable chefs and product experts using food psychology.Meal Mindfulness helps you slow down your eating and naturally enjoy the health and stress-relieving benefits of trusted mindful eating techniques. IGGI App: Our included app is free for life with IGGI Bowl instructions, healthy eating tips, recipes, mindful habit cards, and more! Mindful Eating Audio: Learn how to appreciate your meals by slowing your rhythm and allowing the satiation message to get to your brain before you overeat. Mindful Habit Cards: Our cards offer expert tips that help you build healthy habits. Meal Mindfulness Facebook Group: Enjoy mindful eating tips, mindfulness coaching, recipes, bowl tricks and tips, and community support!  Pack your lunch or dinner in IGGI Bowl for healthy meals on the go! No more leaking lunch bags or spilled sauces. The bowl lid has a deep profile and hermetic seal that ensures no leaks in your bag.Plus, IGGI Bowl comes with a tight-fitting neoprene-style carry case that helps lock the bowl down for convenient portability.IGGI Bowl is crafted from genuine 100% Stoneware which is known for it's durability and beauty. The start-of-the-art glazing has no lead or nasty chemicals and is completely food-safe.IGGI Bowl 100% Microwave & Dishwasher-safe.There’s nothing to encourage healthy eating like an accountability partner. Get a pair of IGGI Bowls and enjoy mindful eating with your partner, friend or roommate.In 2010, a study revealed the average American eats 23% more calories than in 1970. Many of us overeat because it’s all we’ve ever known. We never learned appropriate portion sizes and we’re surrounded by excessive eating out in public. IGGI Bowl makes portion control fun and teachable for kids and teens. Make recipes together, challenge each other to try new segments and build healthy habits as a family.Packing lunch gets old—fast. Especially when we’re trying to be healthy.IGGI Bowl makes taking lunch to work or school painless. Just follow the included recipe cards and you can have a healthy, delicious and simple meal every day. IGGI Bowl is a non-intrusive, inexpensive and safe way to eat healthy and stay healthy.It’s not an expensive weight loss program or ineffective green superfood powder. You simply replace your plates with IGGI Bowl and enjoy eating delicious food with the Meal Mindfulness system as your guide.Sound familiar? Yeah. It does for me too. I’m Roderic—the founder of IGGI Bowl.At 47 years old, I realized my health was heading downhill. My metabolism was slowing with age but my eating habits hadn’t adapted.

This set is sure to make your cocktail cabinet complete. This heavyweight decanter is made from 100% lead-free Crystalline Glass. The ergonomic design is comfortable in your hand, both while pouring and when carrying it. The glass stopper is precision milled to create a near airtight seal, keeping in the spirit's aroma.   Liiton Mirrored Serving Tray (Indiegogo price $79, MSRP $99)Entertain your friends with all the class of a 5-star lounge. The Liiton Mirrored Serving Tray features a reflective base that captures the ambient light and redirects it back through the facets of the Everest decanter and tumbler peak design to dazzle your guests. The tray is made from full grain leather, the topmost quality leather available on the market and full leather stitch. Liiton Coaster Set (Indiegogo price $59, MSRP $79)The matching Liiton coasters are also made from only the best materials — full grain  leather and full leather stitch. These weighted coasters prevent the coaster from sticking to the tumbler when lifted, and the raised leather rim catches all condensation within the coaster so water doesn’t run onto your table or bar. The genuine cork inserts are replaceable — each pack of Liiton coasters comes with 4 extra cork inserts.    From Aperol Spritz to Zoom, this glass can be used to sample your favourite cocktail, spirit or even fruit-infused water. Every type of drink looks good in an Everest glass. Crystalline glass is a wonderful alternative to lead crystal. It is wonderful to look at, hold and display. Crystalline offers a magnificent clarity and brilliance, 100% lead free! Benefits of Crystalline Glass:- Offers a high clarity- No risk of lead leaching into drinks or alcohol- wonderful weight qualities- Stronger than glass- Dishwasher safe- The crystalline drinkware has high clarity Made with 100% recyclable silicate, the Everest Whiskey Set is made from nature's most recyclable material.

HaloFalls is sonically engineered to create the healing sounds of water right beside you.The gentle sound of flowing water can be a meditative experience, resulting in a happier, healthier, calmer state of mind. In fact, the mere sight and sound of water can induce a flood of neurochemicals promoting wellness and increased blood flow to the brain.Your HaloFalls unit is ready from the moment it is taken out of the box. All you need to do is add water and plug it in. The sounds of water have been used for centuries to aid meditation. The psychological benefits of being around water are:Its compact size makes HaloFalls perfect for anywhere, whether it's a sprawling living room, a cozy bedside table, or an office where you just need that extra piece of serenity.The beautiful lampshade has been designed in a manner that makes it extremely low maintenance. It can be easily disassembled for cleaning with simple cleaning solutions. No tools required.Each ‘halo’ has been precision engineered to produce optimal visual and aural brilliance. Immerse yourself in the calming acoustics of the trickling waterfall.HaloFalls is powered by a submersible pump that operates very silently. That means whether it’s the gentle sound of the waterfall or the music emanating from the speaker, everything will be heard clearly.Our research identified the most common problem of traditional indoor water features – damaging water spillage. We did two things to counter this problem:1. The waterfall was engineered in a precise manner so that the water flows directly from one layer to the next without spilling.2. We designed an outer tapered drum lamp shade that would stop water droplets from spilling outside.HaloFalls comes in two preset light modes so you have the flexibility to create an ambiance suiting your mood.Cool White (6000K)It’s bright and cool. Simple lighting, perfectly suitable for reading. It’s the comforting light of a traditional fluorescent lamp that illuminates its surroundings.Warm White (3000K)It’s natural, relaxing, and heralds the end of a day. Select this winding down mode and settle down for a good night’s sleep.A step-less dimmer helps you get the right amount of brightness.The case is made of thermostable and harmless silicon materials. That makes it heat resistant and increases its durability. The shade is given a unique gradient tint from top to bottom, easing eye strain.The multi-level rounded LED lighting is cleverly designed to maximize the light output and provide a unique design aesthetic. The flicker-free, glare-free, UV-free, and evenly distributed 360-degree illumination protects your eyes from strain, dry eyes or fatigue of any sort. This makes it perfect as a living room, desk or study lamp, protecting your eyes from all angles.As nature lovers, we intended to make HaloFalls as energy-efficient as possible. This is made possible with the built-in LED fixture that’s not just durable, but uses very little power.You’ll notice an LED ring light on the base as well! The ambient lighting here is reflected on the water, resulting in a beautiful interplay of light and water. It’s truly one of those small, magical joys.Whether you are listening to your favorite singer belting out an all-time classic, or deep into an entertaining audiobook, the crisp tonal quality of the speakers will captivate you. Designed to sound great in any environment thanks to two powerful 5W speakers with an ultra-wide full range driver and 360-degree grille.No waiting, no searching. The efficient Bluetooth pairing helps you connect wirelessly to your favorite playlists, audiobooks, Spotify, etc. on any digital device, from up to 30 feet away.To protect the speakers from accidental spillage, a high-quality water-resistant acoustic fabric has been used.

</div></div>","Pico will help you take your first steps into the magnificent world of growing plants. Easy and affordable, it ensures your plant journey is a success from day-one.
 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

 
 

 

Growing plants indoors around the year can be tough because they require lots of direct sunlight to thrive. Unfortunately, you can’t carry sunlight around to make sure your plants get the energy they deserve. 
Thanks to Pico's multi-spectrum LED grow lights, giving your plant enough light isn’t a problem anymore; with it, you too can #GrowLikeaPro.     
 
The LEDs are mounted on an easily-adjustable telescopic arm—because plants grow like crazy under our LEDs! Reminiscent of a vintage radio antenna, it grows alongside your plants. As they extend upwards towards the light, extend Pico by up to a foot in height
 

 


With its USB Type-C ports on both sides, you can chain up to 3 Picos together with a regular phone charger. Or build yourself an indoor jungle with 6 Picos powered through a 5V 3A charger! Just connect cables to either side, and each Pico will accept and pass-through power to the next one.
 

Power Pico through any USB Type-C cable. Included with your Pico are 2 cables to get you started, a short double-ended USB-C and a 3 meter (10’) super-long cable, along with magnetic organizer loops to help route the cable around fridges, windows or anything else magnetic. You may use any phone charger to power the Pico and the optional Pico-timer to automate it. 

 

The Aluminum heatsink makes the LED module rigid and lightweight; it also helps the LED chips last longer through its excellent heat dissipation.   
 
         
 

Regardless of how busy you are, Pico’s watering system makes sure your plants have as much water as they need—no more, no less—to sustain their health and beauty. All you need to do is top-up once a week. 
 

The transparent window lets you know when it’s time to top up, typically once a week. Employing just capillary action and gravity, this design does not require any power supply or involve a motor or pumps. Your plants will also grow quicker and healthier due to root oxygenation from below, provided by the ventilation holes.      
 

Watering too little can kill your plants, but so can too much. Getting it right takes time and experience. Not many of us have it. With Pico, that’s all taken care of for you!
 

 

 

Plant pots take up space. They often can only be placed on flat surfaces by windows, which limits your options.
With Pico, any place is a good place to grow some plants.
Work desk? Check. Fridge? Check. Wall? Check. Glass window, bathroom or even in a vehicle? Check, Check, Check. 
 
 All 3 interchangeable mounts are included with your Pico.
 
 

Why several mounts?  Because when it comes to plants, you can't have too many and you might want them everywhere. 
 

 
 

 

 
 

 

Research has long suggested that indoor plants have a positive effect on the human mind and body. Studies show up to 60% reduction in depression, over 40% in anger, and just under 40% in anxiety. And at work, plants have increased the productivity of the office by up to 15%!
 

Plants have been proven to improve motivation and concentration, increase energy levels and decrease fatigue. And thanks to the transpiration and evaporation of water from plants, they increase the air quality and improve eye strain and skin health, and reduce the spread of airborne diseases.
 
 

 

Always wanted to have fresh edibles at hand? Imagine being able to throw your own homegrown, organic basil onto that bowl of pasta, or some fresh mint on your chicken. 
No more runs to the store for that missing ingredient, having to wash the pesticides and chemicals off of your leafy greens.

Growing edible plants can be a challenge. And while the end result is often worth it, it is a commitment most people find difficult to make. With Pico, we made sure to get all variables just right, so you can grow your favorite herbs at home without a hassle.

This means we're no longer working with prototypes but our desks are going into mass-production. We hope you're just as excited as we are, check out the video we quickly shot in our showroom below to see where we stand now. Stay tuned for many more updates on how production is going. This is the final shape of the much awaited Smart One and Phantom1, including all the tiny adjustments we have made since posting the first photos of the prototypes. Check out these improved desks, the very first pieces to come out of standardized production.

 

 

 
 

Phantom1 moving for 14 hours straight with double the weight the average user would put on it. We modeled three years of daily usage by capturing the amount of height setting changes an individual might put their desks through using it 5 days a week. We think our desk did pretty good! Check the video below:
 


 


 


 


 

 


 


 
Our unique, height-adjustable desks take care of your health and are easily controlled bya smartphone app. Each desk can monitor your time spent sitting and indicate when it’s time to get up and continue working in a standing position.
The application compiles office-friendly personalized fitness and stress relief exercises,to help you achieve your GOALS and to help you relax while at work. It informs you of the air quality of the room and tells you when it’s time to open a window.

 
Why wouldn’t we pay attention to our health at work, too? AiT Smart Desks have all the necessary features of innovative devices: unique, state-of-the-art design,fitness and health module and mobile application.

AiT is available in a variety of colors, by choosing just the right color-combination and the functions you need the most, you can create a desk that suits your style.

While there was a time when people wanted to get out of their homes to cut the city noise and relax in nature. Listen to the soft gusts of wind… the pattering of the raindrops on the camper roof or even the crackling of the firewood while roasting marshmallows… we are now at a stage when these ambient sounds have become a distant memory in the past two years.Refreshing your home ambience while you work or even take a power nap, the SOUL ambient sound generator brings in the comforting sounds of the sea surf or the soothing sounds of a forest. Featuring high fidelity natural sounds that replace the urban noises, the SOUL helps you to fall into deep sleep quickly. The sounds also help you to calm down for your yoga routine and overall elevates your wellbeing.    Review by Tech I Want





 
SOUL is designed to play eight sets of natural sounds. All the sounds are recorded individually from the source of origination. The recordings are done using professional equipment and perfected by sound engineers. The optimization process followed by the technicians, remove any unwanted noise (including excess treble and bass). The result is the perfect recording for your relaxation. ▲Alpha Wave: This mysterious but stress-relieving wave sound can boost your creativity and relive your pressure. ▲Breeze: Gentle summer wind blowing outside your balcony. Recorded in extended loop for better immersion.  ▲Fireplace: The gentle smoldering sound of a charcoal fireplace at midnight. ▲Rain: A refreshing springtime showers. Cooling rain drops landing gently on your roof.  ▲Thunder: Thunder striking through the sky from a distance. Sound is engineered such that it won’t “strike” too close. ▲Stream: Claim running water of a fresh stream.

The padding also works as an anti skid layer, giving Menka extra stability on smooth surfaces.The thoughtful package includes an easy to use lid to kill the flame instantly.HOW DOES MENKA WORK?It took thoughtful designing, 3D modeling and several modifications to perfect it, but the way Menka works is actually pretty straight forward:Heat from burning fuel forces air to escape from the top of the glass tube while sucking air from bottom. The spiral design of base rotates the entering air, this rotating air catches the flame and makes it tall and twisty, seeming as if fire is dancing. Using Menka is as easy as it gets!
Pour fuel into the fuel can and a click of a lighter.
Place the glass tube on top and watch an ordinary flame turn into a mini fire-tornado. 
There are no motors, cables, pipes or buttons, and no maintenance,
But, where to get the Fuel?Its equally uncomplicated. it runs on easily available alcohol fuel, but we recommend Bio-ethanol, which is CLEAN, CHEAP and EASY TO FIND!Menka can go up to 2.5-3 hours on a single refill, That's super efficient and the running cost stays low! Based on the cost of Bio-ethanol in the US, the running cost comes to less than $2 an hour.What's in the Box?Material & Technical Specs
Menka comes in two color options:R&DThoughtful design went into the making of Menka, We kept minute details in mind while prototyping and testing it. While our main goal was to make an impressive show of fire we also put our focus equally on simplicity, ease of use along with ergonomy, environmental footprint and most importantly safety. Menka took over a year of several design iterations, feedback, and improvements to reach perfection!Environmental friendliness was a primary focus from the beginningAll things from the material, to fuel and the design focus on increasing the longevity and impact of the flame but reducing the environmental impact. Read FAQs to know about how Menka is eco friendly. Menka arrives before the holiday season!Our guarantee is backed by our successful crowdfunding campaign and fulfilment in Japan!A final word..Humans share an ancient bond with fire since time millions of years ago. Natural live fire is used less and less now with urbanization and modernization. Menka brings the soothing experience of sitting by a fire back into our lives, all in a safe, convenient and portable package. A lot of passion, hard work and finesse went into the making and perfecting of Menka. A successful Indiegogo campaign and your support will enable us to stay motivated and continue to turn many more crazy design ideas into a reality. About the name Menka: Menka is the name of a beautiful mythical celestial dancer. And our ‘dancing’ flame is nothing less. We are always around to answer all your questions about Menka. Contact us at contact@oodme.comThank you :)",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Cold Milk How?</h3>
<p>The Barisieur uses a cooling unit called a peltier cooler. Unlike traditional fridges, it has no moving parts and doesn’t use hazardous substances. </p>
<p>By the magic of the thermoelectric effect - one side of the fridge goes cold and one side gets warm. Resulting in the milk fridge staying at 2°C to 3°C all day, every day.</p>
<h3>Infrared Technology, Auto-Activates Fridge</h3>
<p>Whether you have milk with your tea or have run out. The Barisieur Milk Fridge features an infrared sensor that automatically turns on the fridge when it detects milk inside the fridge - Saving energy when not needed.</p>

</div></div>","The Automatic Coffee and Tea Maker with Alarm Clock Functionality    Tea made, served in bed, with milkEase into the day with the sound of bubbling water and the smell of freshly brewed tea or coffee. Designed to sit comfortably by your bedside, enjoy a fresh cup of English breakfast with fresh milk, or a delicate green tea from the comfort of your covers. 
  
 
 Establishing nightly & morning routines The Barisieur encourages a night-time routine which helps you wind down and prepare for sleep. You are more likely to fall asleep faster, get a better night's rest, and then wake up more easily, becoming alert faster.Compared to the beeping of a phone alarm or the luminescence of a “sun” alarm clock, they both lacked two important features for us:   Aroma & TasteBeing stimulated by multiple senses helps you to focus and wake up more gently. A delicious smelling brew is a great way to do this. No one looks forward to that cold kitchen floor facing you and your first cuppa in the morning.   Functional TrayYou only really need to wash the cup and the Brew Chamber for the next use. However, if you decide to clean all the accessories now and then; the timber tray lifts off effortlessly to help transport. Brew Chamber TechnologyThe Brew chamber features on the Barisieur 2.0 or with our Manual kitchen brewer to help you make a perfect cup of coffee or tea every morning.Tea Gate’s Unique DesignDue to its cylindrical and conical shape, the gate provides a perfect seal when in position in the glass chamber. Simply lift the strainer up to release the brew directly into your cup.The Manual BrewerTake your brew chamber off the Barisieur and use it in the kitchen with our specially designed brew stand. (Available in Walnut & Blond Wood) Immersion Coffee with the Manual BrewerCold Brew with the Manual BrewerCoupled with the Brew Stand, the Brew Chamber makes cold brew quick and easy.
Place 1 or 2 servings of ground coffee in the chamber
Top up with cold, filtered water.
Place in the fridge for 10-16 hours
Take out and serve!
Enough for 2 cups of cold brew The Double Walled Glass MugKeep your brew hot when you hit the snooze button. The insulated mugs keep your brew at drinking temperature for 15 minutes longer than with regular mugs. Available for all pledges - Add +£7 to your pledge to add one to your order!   A perfect fit for all BarisieursThe Wireless ChargerDesigned to add wireless charging to your Barisieur by plugging directly into the USB port in the back. It also works perfectly by itself. 
 
 
Walnut Wireless Charger INVISI-GRIP - Secures your phone whilst it charges so it's less likely to slip off accidentally. Invisi grip gives you all the benefits of a rubberized top plate without comprising on design and aesthetics.     
Cold Milk How?
The Barisieur uses a cooling unit called a peltier cooler. Unlike traditional fridges, it has no moving parts and doesn’t use hazardous substances. 
By the magic of the thermoelectric effect - one side of the fridge goes cold and one side gets warm. Resulting in the milk fridge staying at 2°C to 3°C all day, every day.
Infrared Technology, Auto-Activates Fridge
Whether you have milk with your tea or have run out. The Barisieur Milk Fridge features an infrared sensor that automatically turns on the fridge when it detects milk inside the fridge - Saving energy when not needed.
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How-To: Making your First Brew
The Barisieur uses a simple set of toggles to set the time, alarm, and brew delay.

Hold the large button on the side 4 secs to set the time 
Hold the large button on the side 2 secs to set the Alarm 
Rotate the Brew Delay to -5,0,+5,+10,+15 - Allowing your brew to either start brewing before, on, or after the alarm.
Toggle down to snooze the alarm (not the brew)
Toggle up to reset the alarm for the next day
Click Make to brew on demand or manually turn brew off.

Barisieur Glass
Hand-formed glass made by Master Glass Blowers.
Our Glass is hand-formed by masters using the purest borosilicate glass available. Borosilicate glass is renowned for its superior durability, heat resistance, brightness, and clarity. All of our glassware goes through many stages of production and testing. The result is our unique set of glassware designed solely to help you make and enjoy tea as it's meant to be. We hope you enjoy using each piece as much as we do. 

 
Solid Timber Construction
Our wood trays are machined from solid wood and go through a vigorous hand-finishing process. They are then treated with a stain and water repellant matt varnish so no need to worry about stains.
Coming from FSC-Certified forests we make sure that what we take is given back, so our forests stay healthy and continue growing. 


Who are We?
Joy Resolve (Originally Barisieur) made its debut in 2016 on Kickstarter with our original coffee brewing alarm clock. Since coming to market we’ve had incredible success working with the likes of Harrods, Selfridges, and Bloomingdales.
Brew Chamber & Wireless Chargers are our first major update to the Barisieur since our release to the market. To commemorate the occasion we decided to go back to our roots and launch it here for our Kickstarter community.
 
 ""We believe quality and timeless design is the best form of sustainability""
 
Extra Information:
We have a warehouse in UK, Germany, the USA & Hong Kong. We can ship World-wide with every Voltage and different Plugs.

 
Project Timeline
With our successful campaign in 2016 and the 6000 Barisieurs we’ve sold, our supply chain and manufacturing partner links are strong and ready to start production of the Tea Barisieur and Brew Chamber.

 
Barisieur Quality Control
Every Barisieur is fully tested before leaving the factory. That means every single Barisieur boils 2 servings of water to check it is functioning.

 We were very conscious of what we were designing. Unfortunately for the last few decades, we have been forced to accept the hideous products on the market, and we couldn’t stand for that. We wanted to create a product that was beautiful, clean, and practically invisible.  We focused on what was important to the user, rather than what was important to the company. We created a quality product from the ground up that we are happy to call our own. Our hearts, minds and even weekends were poured into this new project. Iterations:Final Masterpiece:CAD:Prototype Sample: (Sorry we are having issues uploading all videos)   The team consists of an experienced consumer expert with over 13 years developing products that people use in their everyday lives.  An experienced industrial engineer who worked over 4 years at one of the largest safe companies.  Our design and marketing guru has over 20 years of experience at the largest consumer brands you know. Our electrical engineer and coders have developed world class apps and products you see daily. The funds generated through the campaign will help finance the pilot series production and pay for the rest of the code development.  By helping us, you will also be rewarded with the lowest price The Space Safe will ever be at.

With a patented special sifting system, the process begins just minutes after your cat has left the device to ensure the best pet care experience. Thanks to the motor-free design, you can be sure that your cats do not have to suffer from ""flushing noises"" or the sudden movement of the litter box. In use, it is quiet so that it would not disturb you or your cats at night to give you peace of mind.You’ll rarely have to take your Woof ‘N Meow apart. The four-part modular structure of the base, globe, bonnet, and drawer can be individually removed for easy assembly and occasional maintenance. The fully enclosed door frame is designed to prevent the odor from escaping from the waste drawer into the inner space of the globe. Furthermore, the waste drawer is tightly closed without showing the waste from the outside and simultaneously locking the odor.  Keep your cat's personal space thoroughly sterilized! Woof ‘N Meow has an activated carbon deodorization and antibacterial module that can effectively decompose fecal odor molecules and ensure proper airflow. Thanks to the deodorizing system, you do not have to smell the strong odors when you remove the waste. Our four-part modular design is constructed with easy upkeep in mind. Whether it’s spot-cleaning or deep-cleaning, the simple modular design allows you to easily clean and maintain your Woof ‘N Meow.The special sifting system uses a combination of precise time, rotation, and gravity that removes the clumps when you rotate the globe manually. It also removes only the clumps, preserves clean litter, and saves you time.Carrying cat litter? You don't have to anymore! It's incredibly easy to empty the litter by rotating the device clockwise and lifting the trash bag out of the drawer, which even a child can do!Created for all breeds, Woof 'N Meow is perfect for a multi-cats family and it's budget-friendly by not using so much litter.  Woof 'N Meow reduces waste by up to 50%, and the door height is moderate to facilitate smaller or older cats with limited mobility.Woof 'N Meow was founded by a team of animal lovers who are always looking for innovative ways to make pet care easier for everyone. In 2020, the founder of Woof 'N Meow, Wayne, rescued an abandoned cat named Sesame. He was in extremely bad condition and ill at the time.Immediately, Wayne brought Sesame to the veterinary clinic, where he was diagnosed with panleukopenia and feline infectious peritonitis. After a long 4 months of constant monitoring and care, Sesame was healed and now she is a happy and healthy cat.But, there was one problem that worried Sesame.Wayne had a fully automatic cat litter box for Sesame and his two other cats in the house. Despite the convenience, Sesame feared the noise of the automatic cat litter box and refused to use it. However, a traditional cat litter box required too much effort to scoop and clean, which was not suitable for a family with several cats and someone working in the office like Wayne.After endless days of online research and countless visits to pet stores, Wayne still didn't find the perfect cat litter box he was looking for. Exhausted and concerned, Wayne spoke to one of his friends who had experience in the industrial design industry and connections to the supply chain.In the modern world, caring for pets should not be so difficult. Wayne and his friend Will decided to work together to create the perfect cat litter box for Sesame and other multi-cat families around the world, hoping to bring them peace of mind.After 6 months of designing, testing, and preparing, Wayne and Will created the semi-automatic cat litter box as you know it today. Not only has Woof'N Meow solved the potty problems for Sesame, but the team has also made it affordable for other pet parents, and it is perfect for any family with multiple cats.A message from our founder: Thank you for supporting us on this journey. We hope that the Woof 'N Meow semi-automatic cat litter box will be the solution to your cat's potty problems. We hope that every cat grows up healthy with the company of its beloved owners, who no longer have to clean the litter box every day and can now spend more quality time with them.",59.0,1,"1 Campaign

Scout on CES 2021

Scout debut was at CES 2021 early this year. Pilot lab team leader Mr. Jun was interviewed by Bionic Buzz, and also demonstrated Scout. Unlike other robot products on Kickstarter, Scout is not a prototype, it is ready for mass production. And it is Moorebot’s third-generation robot. You can learn more in this interview video.
Scout is US patented product, including design and technology!

Our certified and lab tested Pure Silver Fibers has reached 99.9% effectiveness.  Aqua Gel Cooling Membrane technology helps wick away body heat to help you feel cooler so that you can fall asleep faster. Providing instant coolness and ultimate comfort.  Carbon and Alpha's ergonomically placed Air Cells increase comfort and breathability that is linked to sweating and snoring.   Bamboo charcoal’s activated carbon absorb toxins, prevents mould growth and purifies air by absorbing harmful gasses.      Impinged nerves can trigger migraines, ensuring that your spine is alined correctly in its natural position it will minimize nerve irritation. It will also help to relieve muscle tension around the neck area.    Alpha's bamboo charcoal infused memory foam allows the pillow to mold into the shape of your head and neck, supporting the sensitive pressure areas to help you relax and help you fall asleep faster.    Alpha's Aqua Gel Cooling Membrane provides instant coolness and ultimate comfort. If you require a warmer or softer side, simply flip the pillow upside-down and enjoy your new experience. Alpha Pillow 2.0 is available in two sizes, Standard (60 x 40 x 14cm) and King (70 x 40 x 14cm).

Most common bacteria found in bedding is gram-negative rods ~42 percent,  gram-positive rods ~27%, both bacilli ~ 25 % and gram-positive cocci ~12 percent. The power of silver technology will act as a shield so that your bedding remains fresh.

Next up: birch-fiber bedding. Struggling to get some shuteye? Here are some top sleeping tips. According to the director of Charlottesville Neurology and Sleep Medicine Center, cool conditions can really improve your chance of rest. ORLY bedding uses 70% birch fibers to help regulate your temperature during the night.The birch fibers are intertwined with super-soft Supima cotton and antibacterial silver nano-beads. You also get a touch of tea tree oil, which offers a range of skin benefits.By utilizing the incredible benefits of pure silver and infused with tea tree essential oil incorporated directly into the heart of the fiber. ORLY has created a unique, innovative product boasting remarkable virtues and promoting total wellness. Our mission was to design a collection of bedclothes combining comfort with technology to bring on the best, most incomparable sleep experience possible. But that was not enough. After the first wash, the fabric becomes denser and heavier.

Combined with ultra-thin mesh, Erazor will completely remove every hair beneath it. Quick recharge through USB-C.Erazor uses zirconium dioxide ceramic blades. This material is used for precision cutting and is well known for its superior performance. With hardness exceeding even the best steel, it will stay razor-sharp for years without sharpening. Combined with 0.05mm ultra-thin stainless steel mesh and a 6600 RPM high-speed motor, Erazor will remove each hair from the root perfectly.  Say goodbye to these:   You can throw away all your razors and shavers as Erazor is the only one you need.Erazor follows a minimalistic design, focusing on providing the best shaving experience with the smallest and lightest profile. We also believe a good shaver should always be ready to do their job.The stubby shape of Erazor differs from others. It is tiny yet sturdy enough to withstand rough handling. You can simply throw it into your toiletries bag, and have it carried-on or checked-on for flight.This is why Erazor has some of the longest standby times and will always work even when the battery is recharging.  The ceramic blade has seen widespread use in precision cutting tasks. With its excellent physical and chemical properties, it is gaining popularity in the kitchen as cooking knives and scissors, as well as various surgical tools in the operating room. It is exceptionally sharp, long-lasting, and requires little care.  Ceramic blades are made with zirconium oxide. This is a strong material that is built to last especially in utility knives and cutters, which means it will stay sharp and retain its cutting edge for much longer without having to replace your blades.  Ceramic blades are chemically inert, and it is more resistant to harmful substances than steel. While metal requires a set of protective coating to avoid premature corrosion, ceramics never rust. You just need to splash the blade under water after use to keep it clean. It is also safe for anyone with an allergy to metal.   You will save money on shaving by choosing Erazor!   For most electric shavers, the metal mesh that leans against your face is more than 0.15 mm thick. The stainless steel mesh of Erazor is just 0.05 mm. Generally speaking, the thinner the mesh, the cleaner the shave. Erazor provides a closer and more comfortable shave, while the mesh will still protect you from getting cut.With a 6600 RPM high-torque motor which is 1.5 times the speed of common electric shavers, Erazor can provide a quick and smooth shave. You will find shaving a whole new experience with Erazor.    No one wants a conventional electric shaver that is bulky and difficult to transport. Erazor is small enough for you to clean up your beard anytime, anywhere, helping you to look sharp all the time. Erazor is only the size of an egg and you can bring it wherever you want, it even fits in your pocket.  We are able to pack the powerful motor, triple ceramic blade, and rechargeable battery into a small size. Erazor is smaller than your average pepper bottle with no external accessory needed. Just slip it into your Dopp kit before leaving!    Unlike steel, ceramic does not rust and mold does not grow on it easily, just twist to remove the blade mesh and wash it under the tap, or use the brush included in the package to clean those tiny stubble stuck in the shaver blade. Easy-Peasy! It is chemically inert and doesn’t rely on a protective coating, so you can use any shaving product without fear of corrosion.    Hold the power button for 3 seconds to enter the Safety Lock Mode. This will avoid Erazor from accidentally switching on and makes it perfectly safe in your bag. You can simply hold the power button for 3 more seconds to quit this mode. With this feature, you will never worry about it starting by itself in your pocket or bag.    Erazor is powered by a highly efficient rechargeable battery embedded inside the body. With excellent storage and leak-proof properties, combined with the low-friction motor, it stores enough power for 60 days shaving of average duration. On average trips, you can basically forget about recharging your shaver!  You do not need to recharge Erazor every time. In fact, you do not even need to recharge it every week! The motor we use is so efficient that it can shave for at least 60 days before requiring a recharge. Recharge can be done with any USB-C cable and completes in 2 hours. You may as well use it like a manual razor, since you won’t need to charge it on most trips anyway. (emergency charge, charge 3 mins for 10 mins usage)  Erazor has a Type-C USB port that you can charge with a wall charger, power bank, or even your laptop through any USB cable. So even if the battery does drain, you can recharge it easily. On top of this, Erazor can continue shaving even when it is being recharged!              Erazor was born from a group of talented individuals that have different background and unique skills.

Any other options require advanced DIY skills. We wanted to create a no-compromise, affordable art piece that would allow anyone to enjoy a mesmerizing kinetic sand sculpture at home.So we spent the past year and a half building dozens of prototypes and refining our design, and now we are proud to finally be able to share it with the world. SANDSARA has been obsessively engineered down to the smallest detail to reach our goal of making an affordable sculpture without sacrificing on quality.    Sometimes, it feels like every single second of our lives is filled up with something to do. For millennia, Eastern philosophies have known of the benefits and importance of the simple act of doing nothing, even if it's just for a few minutes at a time.There is something about SANDSARA that connects to a very primal and deep part of our brains. Maybe it's the perpetually changing patterns drawn in a bed of very fine sand, maybe it's the surprising motion of the sphere that appears to move by magic, or maybe is knowing that every time you look at it, the pattern will be unique and soon will be gone forever.Whatever that something might be, when you walk past it, it is impossible to ignore. Like looking at the waves crash on the beach or staring into a bonfire. Your mind wanders. Suddenly you are doing nothing but being in the moment.The name SANDSARA is a reference to Samsara, a concept essential to many Eastern religions like Hinduism and Buddhism. It is meant to represent the infinite cycle in which everything is born, lives, dies, and is reborn.It implies all of our actions are connected with the universe. All the things that have happened before have brought us to the place we are standing right now. And every action we do today will affect everything else in the future. Everything is chained in a never-ending cycle.Seeing the sequence of new patterns forming while erasing the previous ones, made us think of this beautiful concept that fits perfectly with our purpose of creating an experience that lets you take a break, reflect and restart.Beautiful inside & outSpending so much time and effort perfecting the inner workings resulted in the development of an extremely compact, yet powerful mechanism that opened the door to an outer shape, unlike anything that exists out there.Don't let the streamlined and subtle design fool you, thanks to our innovative mechanism, SANDSARA is able to move the sphere right into the very edge, thus allowing it to draw large paths that fill 100% of the sand bed. With all of that wasted space gone, we focused on creating an elegant form that immediately catches the attention of everyone who enters the room.Infinite artworks in one single objectCreating new paths for SANDSARA is incredibly simple. Not only will you be able to choose from over 100 patterns from our growing library, but building your own patterns is very easy, as it understands X and Y coordinates.  Our iOS and Android app also allow you to download new patterns or translate existing polar or .svg ones, which means you will be able to load pretty much any path you want. The possibilities really are endless.Experiment with motion. Create new trajectories. Enjoy all the designs you can imagine. Living artSANDSARA is not just a captivating piece of art. After spending some time appreciating it, it seems like something greater. Like a new kind of life form creating unique and surprising patterns, always evolving. A gift to make a differenceWe express ourselves in many direct ways, but also by the things we give on special occasions. SANDSARA is the perfect gift for those who enjoy harmony and elegance. A unique present that will stay in their memory forever.The FrameEvery part of SANDSARA is exceptional, making it an outstanding product. We designed a beautiful frame that outlines the sand patterns and gives a fine touch without stealing your attention. The 45° chamfer in the edges is a subtle detail that merges the wooden frame with the sand bed into one. We chose black walnut and birch because of their elegant appearance and durability. SANDSARA is machined out of solid wood, and hand-finished with an ultra-thin layer of natural wax to protect it and make the wood grain pop. It is soft to the touch and has a sleek matte appearance.Our CollectionOur unique mechanism allowed us to build SANDSARA in irregular, complex shapes. We wanted it to be a beautiful object on its own.The HaloThe design is sober and timeless. It blends in perfectly in any room, the complex sand patterns are contrasted with the subtle circular shape. The StelleIts form is meant to be the center of attention in any space. The design is eye-catching and it immediately becomes a conversation piece. The sand patterns precisely delineate the six-pointed star shape for an extra dose of wonder. Choose your favorite or collect them both!Note: All paths are compatible with both The Halo and The Stelle out of the box, the internal software features a shape avoidance feature that makes sure paths fill out 100% of the sand bed of each shape.The technical detailsOne of our main goals was to keep the overall size of SANDSARA as small as possible while maintaining a larger surface for sand patterns. To achieve this, we developed our own custom mechanism based on a SCARA design.Compared to cartesian or polar designs, SCARA provides unique advantages to maximize the usable area and keep the overall footprint small. This allows us to create The Stelle, which would be impossible using other kinds of mechanisms.   While using SCARA provided additional challenges in the logic and software, as the X and Y positions needed to be solved using inverse kinematics, it was a challenge we enjoyed and was quite worth it.The final result is a streamlined piece of art that wastes no space and has a large sand bed, allowing the patterns to go right into the edge of the frame.  We wanted to allow anyone to very easily create new patterns for SANDSARA. Programs are simple .txt files with XY coordinates, we handle all the complicated inverse kinematics math internally. For the Stelle, the software even handles the shape-avoidance, this means the exact same programs work in either the Halo or the Stelle. Programs can be created in any way you want from purely mathematical methods to manually describing trajectories point by point, we will also provide a handy POLAR or SVG to XY converter, so existing programs can be translated to SANDSARA. Programs can be loaded just as easily, using our iOS or Android app to send them via Bluetooth. 
 
Specs 
Add onsOne of the strategies we used to try to keep the product accessible to everyone was to make some of the features optional. While all of our versions share the same solid wood frame and identical mechanism and electronics, we offer some upgrades for people who want to crack it up to eleven.  The AURA add-on integrates customizable RGB lighting beneath the bed of sand. Taking advantage of a phenomenon known as Frustrated Total Internal Reflection, light is spread evenly throughout the surface, and the whole sand bed appears to be made out of light. Ridges look darker as sand accumulates and the sphere leaves a trail of light anywhere it passes.

We’ve worked on animated shows, including My Little Pony and Care Bears, and we’ve helped develop the SNOO. Collectively, we have participated in developing household items people use or are entertained by every day, and we have decades of experience in every field required to do it again. Along with this, many of us are parents, which means Snorble’s development is driven by families like yours.

In the current pandemic, delays with factories, shipping, etc. are a worldwide reality. However, our team is well-versed in production and meeting timelines, and we’ve successfully brought many products to market. We’re adept at working remotely, which we have done successfully for years.</p><p>Outside of production, we have taken many steps to ensure the technical aspects of Snorble are achieved on schedule. We are confident we can deliver a product that performs as promised.</p><p>If our Indiegogo effort is overfunded, we may have to adjust our shipping schedule to meet the higher demand. In that case, we will honestly address it with you. We promise to be honest with any issues that may arise, and will update our backers regularly so you know what progress Snorble makes and the obstacles we face.</p><p> </p><h3 style=""color:#8750A5;"">TOUGH ENOUGH FOR KIDS</h3><p>As parents, we know that kids can put products through their paces! With that in mind, Snorble will meet all applicable safety requirements for toys, as well as for electronic equipment, as required by ASTM test standards. This will ensure that, under typical conditions, our product is always safe and reliable. But rest assured, we won’t stop there. To verify that all our products are as durable as possible, we will have an additional process where we try to anticipate all the strange things that your kids will do to Snorble, including normal dropping and shaking and other acts of mayhem (within reason). If Snorble breaks during this testing, we will improve the design to be even more resilient (however the Snorble warranty will understandably be voided, if Snorble is subjected to any form of abuse).</p><p> </p><h3 style=""color:#8750A5;"">ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENTS</h3><p>We have taken extensive measures to ensure that both Snorble’s manufacture and the product itself have minimal impact on the environment.

Efforts such as this allow us to return the product to secondary markets as a refurbished item, which gives Snorble a new lease on life, and keeps them out of landfills.

Flutterflies. The Rainbow River. These are all part of the imaginary land of Lullaboo we’ve created to address a serious issue: developing healthy, consistent, customized bedtime routines for children.  If you’ve ever found it difficult to get your child calmed down and relaxed by bedtime, we understand. What about getting them to sleep in their own bed instead of yours? Check. Brushing their teeth? Putting their pajamas on? Check, and check. We get it. Our founder, Mike Rizkalla, created Snorble because he faced these same issues with his own kids.   AS FEATURED ON     THE INSPIRATION FOR SNORBLEBefore there was a land called Lullaboo, with all its magic and cute critters, there was the Rizkalla family: Mike, his wife, Dina, and their children, Max and Emily. And they faced the same challenges so many families do, establishing a consistent and healthy bedtime routine. After googling “How to get a toddler to sleep” and receiving 198 million results, Mike discovered there were several sleep aids and trainers on the market.But to his dismay, none offered the holistic approach to bedtime he was looking for. Convinced his own son was (in Mike’s own words) “an adorable descendant of Dracula,'' and recognizing necessity is the mother of invention, Mike invented Snorble.  THE EXPERIENCEFor children: More than just another sleep trainer, Snorble is an engagingly sweet, interactive character who even learns your child’s name. Kids love hugging, playing with, and talking to Snorble throughout the day, and they look forward to the bedtime experience Snorble creates at night.On the journey to falling asleep, Snorble’s magical lights, sounds, and other features generate a soothing, enchanting environment that helps keep your child comfortably in bed. And if your little one wakes up, Snorble helps them self-soothe with bedtime stories, breathing exercises, and more. In the morning, Snorble can even gently wake your child and encourage them to get ready for their day.  For parents: By gamifying the bedtime experience, Snorble keeps your child focused on each task at hand, and encourages healthy, consistent habits that give your family more quality time. Our mobile app presents suggestions and advice from experts in child development, neuropsychology, and more to address your child’s needs, based on age and other factors. Of course, you are the best judge of what your family needs, so you can customize everything to control how and when Snorble engages with your child.In one customizable device, Snorble addresses multiple issues, applying best practices and advice from academics and professionals, which is something missing in the market today. Most importantly, the experience Snorble provides supports your child’s development in an engaging way, which you control, and your child is at the center of. FUN FASHION JUST FOR FUNOf course, Snorble also features lots of fun things just for the sake of being fun, and our adorable outfits are a great example of that. We've got a number of them in the works, but right now you can choose between a panda or unicorn costume to give your Snorble a new look. Better yet, thanks to a little Lullaboo magic, Snorble's face changes whenever an outfit is placed on them! So, order one with your Snorble and watch your child's face as the magic happens!  A LITTLE MORE ABOUT LULLABOOPart of the reason Snorble is so engaging for parents and children is that we’ve carefully balanced Snorble’s capabilities with just the right amount of magic, love, and wonderment. We understand you’re not looking for a smart toy or surrogate to occupy your children’s time. So, while Snorble is incredibly advanced with amazing built-in technology, what really makes it special is Snorble’s character and the captivating land of Lullaboo.  Snorble brings that world to life with your child  because their dreams are the blueprint for what happens in Lullaboo. While Snorble’s love helps children sleep and dream, Lullaboo’s magic grows.  To further that magic and ensure Snorble continues to amaze your child, we’re writing original stories involving all the characters in Lullaboo and the help of a former Walt Disney Imagineer, which Snorble will be able to share, encouraging your child to sleep and dream of the land Snorble calls home. THE TEAM BEHIND SNORBLEA former Walt Disney Imagineer is just one member of our amazing team. To bring Snorble to life, Mike assembled a world-class group of people. Many of our members have extensive backgrounds in education (via publishing and schools), kid’s entertainment, children’s health and wellness, and consumer products. We’ve worked on animated shows, including My Little Pony and Care Bears, and we’ve helped develop the SNOO. Collectively, we have participated in developing household items people use or are entertained by every day, and we have decades of experience in every field required to do it again. Along with this, many of us are parents, which means Snorble’s development is driven by families like yours. We’re motivated and committed to inspire the inner child in all of us by creating products that capture the imaginations of our children, with a purpose - a better life.  NEXT STEPSUpon the successful completion of our Indiegogo, we will continue fine-tuning Snorble for an October release. We will be testing, reviewing, and improving Snorble, based on suggestions from our team, parents, experts, and you. Prototypes of Snorble are already developed, and we’re in further development phases prior to production.Beyond our initial launch of Snorble in October, we have exciting plans for further down the road. From clothing lines and books, to smart toothbrushes and accessories. Maybe one day there will even be a children’s morning program starring our own lovable Snorble. And we intend to keep surprising you with more wonderful things from the magical land of Lullaboo!For now, we're incredibly excited to be offering Snorble to families through Indiegogo, and we hope you'll choose to bring one home from Lullaboo to your family.Sincerely,Team Snorble FURTHER INFORMATION RISKS AND CHALLENGESWith any manufacturing project, there are risks. In the current pandemic, delays with factories, shipping, etc. are a worldwide reality. However, our team is well-versed in production and meeting timelines, and we’ve successfully brought many products to market. We’re adept at working remotely, which we have done successfully for years.Outside of production, we have taken many steps to ensure the technical aspects of Snorble are achieved on schedule. We are confident we can deliver a product that performs as promised.If our Indiegogo effort is overfunded, we may have to adjust our shipping schedule to meet the higher demand. In that case, we will honestly address it with you. We promise to be honest with any issues that may arise, and will update our backers regularly so you know what progress Snorble makes and the obstacles we face. TOUGH ENOUGH FOR KIDSAs parents, we know that kids can put products through their paces! With that in mind, Snorble will meet all applicable safety requirements for toys, as well as for electronic equipment, as required by ASTM test standards. This will ensure that, under typical conditions, our product is always safe and reliable. But rest assured, we won’t stop there. To verify that all our products are as durable as possible, we will have an additional process where we try to anticipate all the strange things that your kids will do to Snorble, including normal dropping and shaking and other acts of mayhem (within reason). If Snorble breaks during this testing, we will improve the design to be even more resilient (however the Snorble warranty will understandably be voided, if Snorble is subjected to any form of abuse). ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENTSWe have taken extensive measures to ensure that both Snorble’s manufacture and the product itself have minimal impact on the environment. Here are just some of the steps we are taking:  Long-Lasting DesignWe will implement special tools and fastening techniques to allow us to replace old parts with new ones without damaging the product. Efforts such as this allow us to return the product to secondary markets as a refurbished item, which gives Snorble a new lease on life, and keeps them out of landfills. I also means Snorble can support more families over more years.Reusability and RecyclabilityWe have various protocols and standards to ensure Snorble is both easily reused and recycled when necessary. For starters, we specify and use materials that feature high post-consumer content. Along with our efforts to extend Snorble’s lifespan, we have designed our packaging to double as its own useful toy, so even it doesn't go straight into the trash.When Snorble’s usability is diminished, our efforts to use materials within the same chemical family will help to make recycling Snorble’s parts easier.Finally, we will follow the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) directive.Sustainable MaterialsRegarding chemicals used in production, we require every supplier we work with to have a fully featured, comprehensive chemical test lab. This will confirm that there are no unexpected or harmful chemicals in any of the materials we use to build Snorble. We will hold our materials’ suppliers to the highest standards, and only purchase materials that can be chemically verified as pure with no undesired additives.We will follow and/or exceed all Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) regulations, so no harmful substances are used in the assembly of our products.Environmentally Friendly FactoriesAll our manufacturing facilities will be audited before and during production, to be sure all environmental rules are followed. If we find a supplier has failed to meet its pollution control obligations, we will use our influence to bring the supplier into compliance or locate a different supplier.",14.0,3,"1 Campaign

Innovative and unique Design in 23 cm of height and 150gr.
 






 
We created a patented and fully Circular system using 3D printing as Digital Manufacturing Process.

 
In this process Ohmie comes to life through the deposition of one single melted filament of biomaterial in a continuous spiral-like movement, with a technique called ""Vase Mode"", gifting Ohmie with its characteristic ribbed feel.
 


 

 
The aim behind Ohmie The Orange Lamp and Krill Design’s work is the repurposing of organic waste from the food industry, through a process of Circular Economy, transforming Nature's resources into eco-design products.
 


 

Krill Design is an Italian Studio that has been developing new Circular Design Products and Biomaterials since 2018. 

 




 

 
Our goal is to deliver the firsts Ohmies to you by November 2021
And let you all have your own Ohmie by Christmas time! Would you like to write about this project?

An LED light strip around the entire inner door frame creates magical illumination, and advanced sensors make using Luminook automatic and effortless. Spend enough time with Luminook, and you’ll wonder how you ever lived without it. 
 
 
  

 The Luminook control module installs inside the closet at the base of the door opening, nearly hidden from sight. The LED strip is also hidden, tucked next to the trim and held in place with specially designed clips. Luminook is equipped with a removable lithium-ion battery pack that can be charged with any USB port. Battery life depends on brightness settings, the size of the space and how often it’s accessed, however you should be able to get well over a month on a single charge. For spaces that are accessed more frequently, consider our High-Capacity Battery Pack (add-on to your pledge for $20), which will double your run-time.   
  Luminook is unquestionably superior to every other closet light on the market, but if you demand the best of the best, you can take one more step up: Luminook+.We use ‘high-CRI’ LEDs in Luminook+, which results in the most vibrant and accurate color reproduction possible. Luminook’s high-CRI lighting helps colors pop, makes textures stand out, and gives finishes depth and luster.CRI stands for “Color Rendering Index,” and it measures the ability of artificial light to properly reflect colors compared to natural light. A low quality, low-CRI light will be missing certain sections of the visible light spectrum. For example, if the light reaching an apple was missing portions of the red spectrum, those colors wouldn’t be present to reflect back to our eyes, and the color of the apple would not be accurate. This effect is why clothes sometimes look different in your closet than they do out in the daylight.On the other hand, a high-CRI light will have significantly better spectral composition, resulting in a more vivid, accurate color, which more closely resembles true daylight.The LEDs in Luminook are very good with a CRI of 80+, however, the 95+ LEDs in Luminook+ take things to another level. It’s the next best thing to having direct sunlight in your closet! 
 Have you ever noticed how some light bulbs in your home look different than others? This is because of differences in color temperature, which is a way to describe the color of light. While the choice of color temperature tends to be a matter of preference, there is growing evidence that the color temperature of the light around us affects everything from our mood to our sleep patterns. The color-temperature of Luminook is adjustable via our smartphone app, from 2700K to 6000K. You can pick your preference, or let Luminook decide based on time of day or position of the sun. 
 Luminook isn't just for reach-in spaces! Luminook can be used in moderately-sized walk-in spaces, in addition to task and accent lighting applications. The removable battery pack allows you to install Luminook in places other LED strips can’t go (think accent lighting under a couch, for example). Luminook’s advanced sensors can be customized via our smartphone app to accommodate almost any installation location. For example, do you want Luminook to trigger via its positional motion sensor? Maybe you’d rather wave your hand right in front of the control module to actuate the light? Wouldn’t it be cool to have the light come on automatically at a certain ambient light level? Do you want different actuation criteria for different times of the day? All this and more is possible with Luminook!  
 
 
 
  The Luminook app serves two main purposes: Calibration and Customization.‘Calibration’ will ask you questions about your closet configuration, then walk you through the installation process step-by-step. It will even take into account the width of your closet and instruct you on adjusting our inward-tilting LED clips to put the brightest light in the center of your space. Next, the app will give instructions on aiming the Luminook sensors at your door, and it will ask you to open and close the door several times to make sure it’s working perfectly. It will even ask you to choose where in the door’s travel you want the light actuation point to be. This allows the light to turn off when the door is mostly closed, but not completely closed. ‘Customization’ can be as simple or as complicated as you wish. At its most basic level, Luminook allows you to customize the brightness and color temperature settings. These choices can be static or based on other variables, such as ambient light conditions, time of day or the position of the sun outside your window (determined by your zip code). You can even create different groups of settings that are selected by the way you open the door or flips of the light switch (when using the Socket Adapter).

We know that once you start with Flic there is so much to discover, and you will soon find Flic shortcuts in your life that can range from mildly convenient to life-saving. Here are some simple getting started ideas: </p><ul>
<li>A find-your-phone button in your hallway - push it and your phone will blink and make some noise.</li>
<li>A next-slide button for your presentation connected to your laptop - push to advance, push twice to go backward.</li>
<li>An ""I'm-home-from school button"" - for your kids to easily let you know that they're home safe.</li>
<li>An in your car share-your-location-with-your-spouse button. Send a geo-tag of where you are so that your spouse can see how far you are from home. </li>
<li>A play/pause/next-song button in your pocket so you don’t have to tap your headphones or talk to a voice assistant on the run. </li>
<li>A counter button to register habits - get a detailed view of how often you change diapers on your baby, how often you drink coffee, where and when you smoke, or at what times you go to sleep. </li>

He had to get out his smartphone, unlock it, find the right app, and then finally register his consumption. It was frustrating, it was painful, and it was complicated. Surely there had to be a more straightforward way?</p><p>Shortcut Labs was founded in 2013 with the mission to create the world's smartest button. The first version of Flic came out on crowdfunding platform Indiegogo for the first time in 2014. Not only was it able to count nicotine consumption, but a wide range of things were possible. Flic had to be connected to an iOS or Android phone, and the Flic team built every single action right into the Flic Apps. It was a great success, as almost fifteen thousand people backed the campaign. </p><p>Since then, Flic and Shortcut Labs have been on a rollercoaster startup ride, and today, Joacim and the Flic team have shipped almost half a million shortcut buttons to 85 countries around the world. Flic integrates with hundreds of technologies we all use daily. Every Flic user has a story to tell about how they use their button. From helping them create perfect morning routines to being the guardian angel that keeps their home safe, there are thousands of innovative and imaginative ways Flic is used. But underneath all of them, one thing always remains the same - Flic makes life simple. A shortcut and a life-hack in the form of a button that brings smiles to millions of faces every day.</p><div data-id=""25201197""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1560446311/pk00f4tzzwiw7zkumyzt.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><div data-id=""25177009""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1560446312/ck5xrzxmje02dk8g0ftn.png"" src=""""/></figure></div><p>Flic 2 looks similar to our previous PbF buttons or ""Flic Single"" buttons, much because we found this design close to perfect.

<p> </p></figure></div></div>","Hi Indiegogo! We are a small team from Sweden that loves to push buttons. We invented the Smart Button in 2013 and launched it right here on Indiegogo in 2014. Thanks to our amazing community, we have run two successful crowdfunding campaigns before and delivered on both of them.    Today, we are very excited to show you what we have been up to for the last three years. Indiegogo - welcome Flic 2 and the Flic Hub LR! Flic is a small push button. In the Flic App, you choose what you want to happen when you push, push twice, or hold it down. You don't need to talk to Flic. You don't need to unlock your phone or trust that an AI will figure you out. You just have to push a button.  We’ve taken everything we’ve learned from making smart buttons for over six years, we’ve listened to feedback from the community and revisited every single detail to come up with a product that we sincerely believe is the perfect button.    The Flic Hub is an optional accessory to Flic so you don't have to connect the buttons to your phone. It has also been rebuilt from the ground up to optimize performance, to add HomeKit capability, and to add Bluetooth Long Range.    The most common ways our community use Flic are to toggle lights and control music. But people are really creative, there are literally thousands of wildly different things that people use Flic shortcuts for!   We all have different routines. What we do when we wake up in the morning, how we get to work, and how we structure our day. Flic is a tool that helps you simplify your everyday routines. Instead of different apps or complicated voice commands, structure your life with buttons!   A push-of-a-button life doesn’t have to be complicated. Quite the opposite! Reduce the clutter with technology that just works.   
 
 
 
  There are a large number of integrations already in the Flic App and ready to use! Through third-party services such as IFTTT, Zapier, and Microsoft Flow, practically anything is possible. And if you're an advanced tech user, with our versatile HTTP Request function you can write your own commands in the Flic App.  Everyone knows how to push a button. We have seen applications for kids, for people with disabilities, for visually impaired, and even for dogs! After 5 years we still see and hear about new amazing things that people do using Flic buttons. Here are just a few things that our community has shared with us:  Flic 2 opens up new opportunities that were not possible before while maintaining the world-class simplicity, stability, and security that Flic has been known for.     The easiest way to set Flic 2 up is with the free Flic App. The most common Flic features are already available there. Here is how the new 2-step pairing with the App works:    
The Flic App is already available. Select what you want to happen for each push, double push, and hold. You can even sequence actions, so that multiple things happen when toy push twice, for example.  The micro-suction adhesive is included with every Flic 2. The suction adhesive allows you to attach Flic to any surface. Micro-suction means it contains hundreds of tiny suction cups that don’t leave any residue! The suction pad is easy to clean with water and can be reused many times. Yep, Maria throws it up on the roof in the last scene - it sticks there like a magnet!  Flic 2 is built for accessories. New label stickers make it easy for you and your guests to understand what each button does.    The new rigid multi-purpose metal clip makes Flic easy to attach to keys, clothes, bags, and much more.   Flic 2 can give you visual feedback in three colors: green, yellow, and red. Just like traffic lights! It can blink green if your action was successful, yellow while you’re waiting (not applicable for most uses), and red if there is something wrong.   With Flic 2, you can access any other app that is open for Flic, and developers can build apps for the entire Flic 2 community. This opens up for A LOT more things you can use Flic for! If you develop a use case for Flic 2, it will immediately be made available to the broader Flic audience.    This is something we are extra proud of - Flic 2 can toggle multiple apps at the same time! You can push to turn on the Lights in your lights app and push twice to snooze the alarm-app!   Flic 2 can switch mode between being a smart Flic button, a Bluetooth Keyboard/mouse, or a Low latency MIDI controller. With Flic 2, there are many ways to be truly creative. If you’re a musician for example, it can be configured to imitate a wireless amplifier switch.   Compared to the original Flic, this button is infinitely more flexible and open. There is no longer a requirement to use the Flic App or the Flic Hub or even to have an internet connection when you set it up. As an example, you can implement our open Flic 2 connection protocol in your Arduino robot, or use our free SDKs for iOS, Android, Linux, or OSX, and many more, without making any stability or security compromises. Read more under For Developers. Every Flic button needs to be connected to something. The common ways are to a phone, a laptop, or a Flic Hub. The benefits of using a Flic Hub is that your Flic buttons don't need your phone to be around in order to work. So in your home or in your office, you can put up buttons that everyone can use even when you are not around. One Flic Hub can be connected to 63 Flic buttons at the same time, while a phone can connect to 6-8 Flics depending on the type of phone.Flic Hub LR (Long Range) has been rebuilt from the ground up, for optimized performance and double range. It has the same discreet and award-winning design as the original Flic Hub, and it packs a lot more power.   We are working together with Apple to add HomeKit support to the Flic Hub LR. This means that all your Flic buttons (including original Flics!) that are connected to a Flic Hub LR can be configured in the Apple Home App. So all your buttons will be able to control everything in your Apple Home ecosystem!  Since this is a lot of work, we won’t have this in place when we ship the Flic Hub LRs in September, but it will be released as a software update this fall.   The IR (Infrared) accessory to the Flic Hub allows you to control things that you otherwise would need a remote control for.  Control your TV, Home Entertainment systems, A/C, to name a few. The IR Accessory is the same that was available before. However, due to hardware improvements in the Flic Hub LR, the precision of the IR learning and blasting makes it possible to use for even more devices.  
Flic 2 and Flic Hub LR both have Bluetooth 5.0 Long Range capability, which means that they can stay connected to each other over larger distances. The range of Bluetooth Long Range can be compared to WiFi if not even better.   Flic Hub LR can support Flic 2 buttons scattered in a large apartment or a small house.   
We truly want to give you the power to create anything. This is why we created the Flic Hub Javascript SDK. With it, you can write code directly on your Flic Hub – in real time! All you need to get started is a Flic Hub and a web browser, no additional software is needed! Read more under For Developers below.   When we released Flic for the first time, we got an incredible amount of requests from creatives, developers and entrepreneurs that wanted Flic buttons to work for their corporate applications. Luckily, we could do almost anything they wanted because Flic is so versatile. We provided code they could apply and a plastic casing for Flic that we could print logos on. Here are a few examples:   We love to talk about the sports fishing app Anglr, who uses PbF buttons (a white label version of the original Flic) to drop location pins whenever a fish is caught. Anglers with wet and slimy hands can't pull up their smartphones when they’ve just caught a fish! Dominos pizza with their pizza button, Pizza Hut with their pizza ordering shoes (yep) and Clarion Hotels' ""Save Me"" button for boring conferences are all creative and inspiring applications.  Sometimes it is not easy to know how a button can make MY life better. We know that once you start with Flic there is so much to discover, and you will soon find Flic shortcuts in your life that can range from mildly convenient to life-saving. Here are some simple getting started ideas: 
A find-your-phone button in your hallway - push it and your phone will blink and make some noise.
A next-slide button for your presentation connected to your laptop - push to advance, push twice to go backward.
An ""I'm-home-from school button"" - for your kids to easily let you know that they're home safe.
An in your car share-your-location-with-your-spouse button. Send a geo-tag of where you are so that your spouse can see how far you are from home. 
A play/pause/next-song button in your pocket so you don’t have to tap your headphones or talk to a voice assistant on the run. 
A counter button to register habits - get a detailed view of how often you change diapers on your baby, how often you drink coffee, where and when you smoke, or at what times you go to sleep. 
   You can control most things and services when Flic is connected to your phone or when it's connected to a Flic Hub. When a Flic button is connected to your smartphone, it can also control functions in your phone, such as Find My Phone, Camera Shutter, Share GPS Location, and more. However, this requires your phone to always be near your Flic button.If you intend to have Flic buttons in stationary places at home or in the office, the Flic Hub is for you. The Hub ensures a reliable experience as you do not have to worry about the connection being lost when your smartphone is not near the buttons. Additionally, other people can use the Flic buttons when you are not around.   Furthermore, a Flic Hub LR can handle many more Flic buttons than a phone. Using a hub is also the only way to use the IR blaster, Apple HomeKit, and Bluetooth Long Range. By backing this campaign you give proof that you support what we do. Your funding helps us develop the products and as a thank you, we send you the rewards that you want as soon as they are finished. When you support this campaign: 
You get Flic 2 and the Flic Hub LR at a much lower price than what will be available after the campaign. 
You receive the products before everyone else.
You can help to shape the products as you want by giving early comments and feedback, and by participating in polls and surveys. 
If you want to be *really* early with trying the products, you can apply to be a beta tester (and accept on some bugs!) 
You will always be our hero ;) 
Our current target for starting to ship is September. As with any crowdfunding campaign, an exact reward shipping date cannot be promised as there are things that remain in the product development. We would rather delay a shipment than shipping products that we are not proud of.  Flic 2We have already kicked off the production tooling for Flic 2 so we’re well on the way but there’s still a lot of fine tuning left to be done which we hope we can finalize before end of June to start ramping up the production in July. As soon as we have a production worthy sample we can also start certifying the product. Flic Hub LRThe Flic Hub LR is using the same design as the original Hub and therefore the tooling is already in place. The electronics is already designed and tested as well! A lot of the software can be ported from the previous Hub but there’s quite a few new features which requires development time and effort such as Long Range and 5Ghz Wifi which also significantly increases cost and requirements during for the certification process.For every Flic 2 you receive we include a CR2032 battery and our micro-suction adhesive pad. For every Flic Hub LR you receive, there is a USB cable included. A power adapter is not included.  Label sticker pack: Add $2 to any reward to get a label sticker pack.Metal Clip: Add $3 to any reward per metal clip that you want. Bundle offers are available for certain rewards.IR Accessory: Add $15 to any reward that includes a Flic Hub LR. How will you know exactly what I wanted? We will send surveys after the campaign and if there is any doubt we will reach out to you directly and ask you! All rewards will be shipped from Sweden. For EU and US VAT and sales tax are included in the rewards. EU and US customers will not be charged any import taxes. For all other countries, taxes and duties may apply.  Why? We learned the hard way that we can't ship to countries where our products are not certified or other reasons, they'll get stuck in customs. If you think this makes no sense, let us know! We may very well be wrong about your country. Shortcut Labs was founded in Stockholm over six years ago. What drove us then and what still drives us is the love for buttons that we share with our community.We want to make life simple for everyone, whether they're a super-user with all the smart home gadgets or a toddler who simply wants a light switch that can be mounted right next to their bed.Controlling everything we do with our phones can become frustrating, tiresome and anti-social (as we're always looking at a screen). Voice is a wonderful tool but, quite simply, it's not always appropriate in all situations. Flic is built to make our interactions with smart devices as simple as pushing a button and, through this, it has the ability to enhance and enrich the lives of millions of people every single day.This is our journey and what we're striving to achieve. We'd love you to be part of it.After a few months of tracking his nicotine consumption on his smartphone Joacim, Flic's co-founder decided enough was enough. He had to get out his smartphone, unlock it, find the right app, and then finally register his consumption. It was frustrating, it was painful, and it was complicated. Surely there had to be a more straightforward way?Shortcut Labs was founded in 2013 with the mission to create the world's smartest button. The first version of Flic came out on crowdfunding platform Indiegogo for the first time in 2014. Not only was it able to count nicotine consumption, but a wide range of things were possible. Flic had to be connected to an iOS or Android phone, and the Flic team built every single action right into the Flic Apps. It was a great success, as almost fifteen thousand people backed the campaign. Since then, Flic and Shortcut Labs have been on a rollercoaster startup ride, and today, Joacim and the Flic team have shipped almost half a million shortcut buttons to 85 countries around the world. Flic integrates with hundreds of technologies we all use daily. Every Flic user has a story to tell about how they use their button. From helping them create perfect morning routines to being the guardian angel that keeps their home safe, there are thousands of innovative and imaginative ways Flic is used. But underneath all of them, one thing always remains the same - Flic makes life simple. A shortcut and a life-hack in the form of a button that brings smiles to millions of faces every day.Flic 2 looks similar to our previous PbF buttons or ""Flic Single"" buttons, much because we found this design close to perfect. But Flic 2 is different from its predecessors in many ways. The outer shape is improved, the battery can be replaced, and the surface material has been perfected. But that's just the plastics. The really big differences are in the circuit board and software.  The Flic 2 circuit board packs a lot more powerful components.   And so does the Hub LR!   The new Flic products are completely backward compatible with all previous Flic products. If you have Flic buttons, they will work with the new Flic Hub LR, and if you have an original Flic Hub, it’ll work with Flic 2.  The Bluetooth Long Range capability is only achieved with Flic 2 connected with Flic Hub LR, and you can still connect original Flics to your Flic Hub LR at the same time. The Flic App for iOS, Android, and Mac will all support Flic 2s. Long range technology will only be available if your receiving device (phone/laptop) has Bluetooth 5.0 Long Range, however. Apps that have implemented the previous Flic SDK will have to include a new SDK in order to support Flic 2 LR.  As a developer, there are a lot of options for you if you want Flic to work for your application. If you have an app, we recommend to include the Flic 2 App SDK which will be available natively for iOS and Android. If you want to develop applications for the Flic Hub, we’ will soon release the Flic Hub Javascript SDK. As usual, there are SDKs and connectivity daemons for other platforms such as Linux and Windows.  No license feesUse any official Flic software for free, most under the Creative Commons (CC0) license. Internet connection not requiredPreviously, Flic products have required an internet connection in the Bluetooth pairing process. But not any longer! (Dear NASA, we can fulfill your request from 2016 now!) Open communication specificationIf you want Flic 2 to connect to other hardware devices, we have some good news for you: the Flic 2 Bluetooth communication protocol is open. Meaning that if you don’t want to use our SDKs and daemons, you don’t have to! Write your own protocol implementation using our guidelines and best practices and you can integrate Flic into literally any hardware running Bluetooth Low Energy.  Our old Flic SDKs (yes, we’ve had two) were littered with restrictions and limitations as a result of decisions that were made when we designed the first Flic back in 2014.This time we have re-worked everything and combined all the good stuff into one SDK that's truly built with openness in mind.It’s easier to set up and integrate, it has multi-app support, fewer restrictions and it’s more reliable!Multi-app supportWith Flic 2’s new architecture, you can connect multiple apps to the same Flic, which opens up a whole new world of possibilities. This means that we are no longer restricted to using one app for one Flic for a single task. Now you’ll be able to combine a flurry of apps to create your perfect workflow.Flic MarketplaceTo kickstart the ecosystem of Flic 2 enabled apps we’ll introduce a Flic Marketplace. This is where people share app ideas and find other apps that do just the right thing. Here you can request features not only to us but to an entire army of developers! Smart Phones are great, but if you want to create solutions that aren’t dependant on a smartphone being around, something that always just works, then the Flic Hub SDK is for you.The Flic Hub SDK with a super easy-to-use programming environment lets you write code directly on the Flic Hub! No Tools RequiredWe wanted to make coding on the Flic Hub accessible to everyone. All you need to get started is a Flic Hub and a web browser, no additional software is needed! Simply log in through our developer portal and connect to our web-based development environment. Start live coding directly on the hub within minutes!JavaScript APIWe created an easy JavaScript API that takes care of all the complicated parts and lets you focus on Your Ideas. However, if you want to get technical, there are advanced, low-level APIs as well.Share Your WorkWhen you're done you can, of course, share your work to let other people take advantage of your awesome ideas!Large Scale DeploymentFor businesses that want to use the Flic Hub in custom solutions at scale, we offer a Device Management platform that lets you push applications to hubs in your domain instantly. Zero SetupWe are also working on a Device Management Platform for large scale deployments of the Flic Hub. For Hubs in the Device Management Platform, there will be an ability to Cloud Configure Hubs. This means that you can assign new Hubs to specific configurations and ship them directly to customers without ever having to open the box. When the client plugs in power and Ethernet, the Hub will fetch its configuration and set itself up automatically. If you are interested in the Device Management Platform let us know and we can sign you up on a pre-release.  If you have an app, a product or a web service that can be enhanced with Flic buttons, you can monetize on your user base by providing information about Flic or selling Flics that have your logo. We can take care of the entire chain from the point of sale until delivery to your customers. Get in touch with our sales team to find out more! We take your privacy very seriously, and that’s not just something we say. With Flic 2, we have changed our mindset. When we created the original Flic, we wanted to collect data in order to individualize and improve the experience for our users, but that’s not how we see it now. We don’t want your data anymore. With our products today and in the future, you can feel safe in that we know nothing about you or about how you use your Flic buttons. We still collect anonymized statistics in the apps so that we can spot bugs and so we can see which functions are popular and not. You can read our current Privacy Policy here, however, we are constantly improving it.   How does Flic work?Flic connects to an iOS or Android phone, a Flic Hub, a computer, or other Bluetooth Low Energy-capable hardware with a Flic software. When Flic is pushed, it activates a pre-defined function. This function can either be something directly on a device - such as making a sound for you to find your phone - or something else such as turning on a light or sending a pre-set email.How many functions can I pre-define in my Flic 2?Flic can be activated with three different triggers: Single Push, Double Push and Hold. With each trigger you can set several different functions so a single push can turn off your morning alarm, start dimming up the lights and turn on the news channel on your TV, all at the same time.What is the range of my Flic?Flic 2 works up to 50 meters away from your smartphone and up to 200 meters if you use the Flic Hub Long Range with a clear line of sight.What is my Flic’s battery life?We have optimized the battery life to last as long as possible. For most use-cases, it will last up to three years or 60 000 clicks. Flic 2 also has a replaceable battery. Just twist the backside using the metal clip or the adhesive back, and replace it with a regular coin cell battery (CR2032).I have Flic 1 already, will they work with the new Hub LR or do I need to buy new Flics?Yes, all old Flics will work perfectly with the Flic Hub LR, but not with Long Range. When we release Apple HomeKit later this year, this will also work with the old Flics (but not the old Flic Hub).What is IR and how does it control my TV, set-top box, etc...?In a nutshell, Flic can replace all your remote controls! IR means infrared and it's the way that old remote controls communicate with TV’s, sound systems, air conditioners and more. We have developed an IR blaster accessory that you can connect to the hub that works like these old remote controls. This means you can clear the clutter on your coffee table and put old remote controls in the drawer as Flic can now replace their common commands. Will I have to pay import taxes on my order?EU and US customers will not be charged any import taxes. For all other countries please see this link if there are any import taxes for your country, keep in mind that the numbers on this website are only indicative.I have moved and have a new address, what do I do?You will receive a survey from BackerKit where you'll be able to confirm and change your shipping address until the day before we start shipping! If you already know that you're going to move in the next 2-3 months let us know and we can check with you before we ship.I can't find my question in the FAQ’s, what can I do?Post your question directly in the campaign page and we will get back to you with the answer.

<li>
<strong>Natural materials</strong>:  Made from natural coconut shells, the filter is <strong>100% safe and healthy</strong> for your pet</li>
<li>
<strong>Smart replacing notification:</strong> Unlike other dispensers, Drinkie shows its filter’s status on the app and sends you a  notification when it’s time to replace it. Generally, the filter can be used for about <strong>4-8 weeks.</strong>

With Drinkie you have an invisible hand that automatically cleans your pet’s dish while you’re away. Featuring a patent-pending Pulse System, the Drinkie dispenser rinses your pet’s dish as many times as you set by the smart app! This means zero health risks for your fluffball, and absolutely no hassle for you.Traditional fountains actually suck.On the one paw, their filters become a source of secondary pollution over time as impurities, dust, food, fur, hair, etc. accumulate there. And on the other paw, you have to replace those filters all the time.But Drinkie keeps your pet’s water cleaner than any filters. This dispenser needs no filters at all! It belongs to a new generation of dispensers, which deliver clean water to your pet’s dish right from the fresh water tank! Stray whiskers, food particles, and germs simply have no way to get into your fluffy’s dish, as they are rinsed away into a separate airtight waste water tank.No extra expenses for you and even cleaner water for your fluffball!And if you’re worried about hard water, we’ve got your back.You can either use filtered water in the clean water tank or choose our special filters available as add-ons, which serve ONLY for softening hard water.Unlike traditional filters that purify dirty water, these filters are placed independently in the fresh water tank and DON’T participate in the dirty water cycle.The purpose of this filter is first of all to take care of your pet’s health, not to protect Drinkie from the scale. Many ingredients in hard water—especially calcium ions can cause urinary system diseases (kidney stones, urethral stones, etc.) and other severe problems in your pets. But with Drinkie’s filter, you can easily soften the water and turn it into a healthy liquid for your pet. Here’s why this filter is ideal for hard water:

Easy to set up: Easily insert the filter in the fresh water tank and press firmly

Ideal for better water quality: Made of ion exchange resin, the filter displaces heavy metal ion, the filter effectively softens hard water, and protects against contamination by limescale

Natural materials:  Made from natural coconut shells, the filter is 100% safe and healthy for your pet

Smart replacing notification: Unlike other dispensers, Drinkie shows its filter’s status on the app and sends you a  notification when it’s time to replace it. Generally, the filter can be used for about 4-8 weeks.

NOTE: If you don’t have a hard water problem, you don’t need to use this filter. To stay healthy, your pet needs to drink a cup of fresh water (0.8 oz/lb) daily.With 106 oz (3 Liters) fresh water storage and 35 oz (1 Liter) waste water storage, you can trust Drinkie to provide sufficient water to your pet for up to 5 days! Go on a vacation, stay late at work or go on a trip without worrying your fur friend’s water will end too soon. The smart app will always notify you when the water in the dispenser is about to finish. How much do you trust your roommate or housesitter to refill your pet’s water tank?With Drinkie’s intuitive app, you can do that yourself, with only a few clicks. There’s even more to this...
Monitor your pet’s drinking habits (water consumption, drinking times)
Set rinsing mode
- Schedule mode (set how often and exactly what time Drinkie should rinse the dish, e.g. 2x per day, one at 8:00 am, the other at 7:00pm)- Intelligent Mode (Set the frequency of rinsing, Drinkie will self-clean and refill fresh water for your pet intelligently)
Check power and battery status
Check the status of the equipment (online/offline)
Share your pet’s information with your families and friends within the app
 One more thing: Without the smart app setup and WiFi Drinkie will function just as a regular dispenser, refilling the water in the dish throughout the day. But once you use the smart app and set the rinsing time, it will turn into a smart dispenser, cleaning your pet’s dish as many times as you set.In fact, Drinkie will continue to loyally do its job even if you have no WiFi connection or your phone is broken unless you change its settings.  No worries about Drinkie’s materials! Drinkie is made from the same materials used for kids, specifically SMMA, SAN, PP, and silicone. These 100% pet-safe, BPA-free, reliable and recyclable materials are scratch-resistant, durable, and made to serve water to your pets safely for years!But there’s even more to this! Unlike other dispensers and fountains, Drinkie doesn’t use any chemicals or UV light to clean the dish, making it absolutely safe for your pet.Drinkie also has no static electricity build-up, no way to break inside or disconnect the power. Your child—human or not—simply has no way to get hurt, even if they try too hard.  Drinkie will keep your fluffy’s dish always full.Simply fill the fresh water tank with water and the dispenser will top up the dish throughout the day once only 4/5 water is left inside.The fluffy won’t be left thirsty at night either: Drinkie will continue to passively replenish the dish once only 1/5 water is left.Drinkie also ensures your fluffy never gets scared while drinking: The dispenser will replenish the dish fast only when its sensors detect your pet isn’t around. And if they’re near, it will slow down the speed of water replenishment for them to enjoy their drink. 
With Drinkie you can save lots of time on washing your pet’s water dish. 
Because it’s automatically cleaning the dish every day, the only time you have to wash the containers and the dish yourself is when the water in the fresh water tank is over. Meaning about once every 5 days instead of several times a day.Whenever it’s time to refill, just take out the tanks and the dish, hand wash them with water under 60°C degrees and fill the fresh water tank again. As simple as that.With Drinkie, power cuts won’t get in the way of your pet’s water supply.Drinkie works both with backup batteries and electricity. If the electricity suddenly goes out, don’t worry: the rechargeable batteries can supply power to the dispenser for up to a week, ensuring your pet never stays thirsty. Emergencies are no longer a problem, especially when you’re away!In fact, Drinkie comes with 2 plug versions—US and international. The first one is a US standard plug, while the international version is a cable that can be detached and reattached to UK/EU/AU standard plugs. Forget about rejected bowls and dehydrated fluffies!Drinkie is designed with your pet’s comfort and physiology in mind. With its shallow, whisker-friendly dish and the perfect height, your pet will love coming back to it again and again.   *Please note that when backing Drinkie and its add-ons you won’t be charged the shipping fee on Indiegogo. We'll request you to pay it prior to the product shipping and you'll be charged later via fulfillment survey.If you backed Drinkie during the 1st week of the campaign when the shipping destinations were limited, don’t worry. Now that we have worldwide shipping, you’ll be able to add your destination in the final survey.Check out the shipping chart below to learn more about the shipping fee for 1X and 2X units for your country or region. As for the shipping fees of our add-ons, the filters, 1-year extra warranty, and the Club Card come with free shipping.For all the other add-ons, the shipping fee will be $3.   We spent tireless months enjoying the process of bringing Drinkie by Cheerble to life. Now the development of the product is almost complete.Currently, we are finally done with the structural design and the adjustments on Drinkie’s appearance design. Now it looks simply pawesome!Also, we are communicating with the mold supplier about the details of the final mold tooling, and conducting a noteworthy test in the subsequent assembly. The hardware design and IOT firmware design have been completed as well. Now, a complete functional test is being carried out in conjunction with the App.As to the development of the Android version App, we’re done with it too! We’re also working on combining the Android version App with the product itself (Drinkie) for a complete functional test. The aim is to ensure the fluency of spraying water and the amount of spraying water; the accuracy of pets drinking water (the accuracy of statistical data), etc. The iOS app is still under development.And lastly, we’re testing our newly added filter for its effect on hard water softening. Fortunately, the supplier we cooperated with gave us a sample that can achieve that effect! We've painstakingly chosen all the materials and production processes involved in the making of Cheerble Drinkie to ensure it's of the highest quality. However, slight changes may be made to the final product to make it even better and ship out to you without any flaws. In any case, we promise to update you promptly and explain the nature and rationale behind any change. Functional Prototype (Demo)",59.0,2,"4 Campaigns

Then the still red hot blade goes through flattening rollers.</p><p><strong>Thermal process:</strong></p><p>Vacuum heat treatment. (1100 degrees) Ice hardened by quenching in temperatures below sub zero(with liquid N2). With this process, the structure of the stainless steel material changes and the blade becomes hard. Finally, tempering (@400 degrees) for 8 hours. This results in a blade that is not only hard and tough but also elastic.</p><p><strong>Steel handle casting:</strong></p><p>The steel handle is sand cast and ground. The handle is then prepped for welding.</p><p><strong>Handle welding to blade:</strong></p><p>The handle is welded to the blade and the weld is ground smooth.</p><p><strong>Periphery polishing and surface grinding:</strong></p><p>The periphery of the blade is polished with a polishing belt. A computer-controlled whetstone adjusts the shape of the knife. Then the surface of the blade tip is thinly ground using a surface grinding process.</p><p><strong>Blade leveling and grazing:</strong></p><p>The blade leveling process consists in polishing the blade edge with a particular polishing material. Then, the entire blade is more finely polished using a grazing process and the entire blade is polished.</p><p><strong>Mirror polishing / Abrasive blasting:</strong></p><p>To obtain a finish finer than that obtained by the grazing process, the blade is inserted between two rollers and is polished with a mirror finish.</p><p><strong>Abrasive blasting:</strong></p><p>The blade is abrasive blasted by shooting glass beads at it. The slight differences of the steel's surface hardness, where one layer meets another, is accentuated and the unique topographic patterns appear on the blade. These patterns are the designs that characterize Damascus kitchen knives.</p><p><strong>Knife polishing:</strong></p><p>The assembled knife is polished by expert craftsmen.</p><p><strong>Printing / marking:</strong></p><p>Each kitchen knife has a laser etched mark printed on it. The mark includes the brand name, blade chemistry, structure, hardness, and lot ID</p><p><strong>Wet type blade edging:</strong></p><p>By grinding and pouring water on the whetstone, it is possible to avoid the production of friction heat which greatly increases the smoothness and the cutting quality of blade's edge. Only workmen with many years of experience are allowed to carry out this important process.</p><p><strong>Final touches:</strong></p><p>All burrs (ragged edges formed during grinding) are removed using tanned leather.</p><p><strong>Inspection and Packing:</strong></p><p>The cutting quality of knives' blades are checked individually. In order to insure maximum sharpness in cutting and durability, the blades should have a specific blade angle. The blade angles of the knives are strictly inspected and controlled with measuring instruments. Then, the completed knives are carefully packed in boxes and shipped.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627964462/nnxreyxf9qr0rrkiqtmx.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>

WHY CHOOSE BODU KNIVESChoosing kitchen knives can be overwhelming. The wrong choice often ends in ruined knives or blades that will not stay sharp.Currently on the market is:1. Inexpensively priced knives that use inferior steel or ceramic that does not last. Many of these knives falsely advertise their steel and use cost-cutting manufacturing processes.2. Mid-tier priced knives that use plastic and wood handles that warp, melt, separate with blades that don’t hold an edge and often lack balance, aesthetics, and longevity.​3. Premium-priced knives that are expensive and require extra care for the blades and handles. Bodu is changing the gameOur knives are designed from the ground up to perfectly balance beauty, functionality, sharpness, ease of maintenance, and lifelong durably at an affordable price.The difference is in our:
Unique knife design
Choice of premium materials
Rigorous manufacturing process

We are doing it this way to make it easier for everyone to get their knives delivered to the correct address. DESIGNED FOR LIFEBodu knives were created because of the team's personal experience with ruined knives. It only takes one accidental ride through the dishwasher to ruin a wooden handle.Or one forgetful night after cutting lemons and not properly cleaning to tarnish most knives.Bodu knives went through dozens of design iterations and prototyping before arriving at the final design.Once the Bodu team was satisfied with the knife design, they turned their attention to the manufacturing process.Not only are Bodu knives made of the highest quality materials, great lengths are taken during manufacturing to ensure a lifetime of performance.Bodu blades are made of 73 layers of premium steel.The inner core of 10Cr15CoMoV steel provides a durable, razor sharp edge while the surrounding 72 layers of 316 stainless steel provide rigidity and protection (for a total of 73 layers).Without the outer layers, the knife would be too brittle and less resistant to water and acidic corrosion. Without the core layer, the knife would not maintain a sharp edge. It's the perfect balance of beauty and functionality.  MANUFACTURED TO PERFECTIONAll Bod knives go through a rigorous 15 step process during manufacturing. While innovations in manufacturing technology helps keep Bodu knives affordable, absolutely no corners are cut or expense spared.Bodu's 15 Step ProcessThe processes for making Bodu knifes:Laser cutting the blades:A computer controlled laser cuts out the desired profile of the knife blade from the welded stack of 73 layers.Forging:The fishbone pattern is power hammered into the red hot blade. Then the still red hot blade goes through flattening rollers.Thermal process:Vacuum heat treatment. (1100 degrees) Ice hardened by quenching in temperatures below sub zero(with liquid N2). With this process, the structure of the stainless steel material changes and the blade becomes hard. Finally, tempering (@400 degrees) for 8 hours. This results in a blade that is not only hard and tough but also elastic.Steel handle casting:The steel handle is sand cast and ground. The handle is then prepped for welding.Handle welding to blade:The handle is welded to the blade and the weld is ground smooth.Periphery polishing and surface grinding:The periphery of the blade is polished with a polishing belt. A computer-controlled whetstone adjusts the shape of the knife. Then the surface of the blade tip is thinly ground using a surface grinding process.Blade leveling and grazing:The blade leveling process consists in polishing the blade edge with a particular polishing material. Then, the entire blade is more finely polished using a grazing process and the entire blade is polished.Mirror polishing / Abrasive blasting:To obtain a finish finer than that obtained by the grazing process, the blade is inserted between two rollers and is polished with a mirror finish.Abrasive blasting:The blade is abrasive blasted by shooting glass beads at it. The slight differences of the steel's surface hardness, where one layer meets another, is accentuated and the unique topographic patterns appear on the blade. These patterns are the designs that characterize Damascus kitchen knives.Knife polishing:The assembled knife is polished by expert craftsmen.Printing / marking:Each kitchen knife has a laser etched mark printed on it. The mark includes the brand name, blade chemistry, structure, hardness, and lot IDWet type blade edging:By grinding and pouring water on the whetstone, it is possible to avoid the production of friction heat which greatly increases the smoothness and the cutting quality of blade's edge. Only workmen with many years of experience are allowed to carry out this important process.Final touches:All burrs (ragged edges formed during grinding) are removed using tanned leather.Inspection and Packing:The cutting quality of knives' blades are checked individually. In order to insure maximum sharpness in cutting and durability, the blades should have a specific blade angle. The blade angles of the knives are strictly inspected and controlled with measuring instruments. Then, the completed knives are carefully packed in boxes and shipped. 
WHY PRE-ORDER ON INDIEGOGOOur dream is to create a home goods company supplying sculpted, utilitarian products at affordable prices. By pre-ordering Bodu knives on IndieGoGo, you're helping make this dream a reality.To keep costs down (and pass along the savings to you), we're collecting pre-orders on IndieGoGo for a limited time.IndieGoGo is a crowdfunding platform. That means our pre-order campaign only lasts for about 30 days. You can cancel your order without any questions during the campaign. We want you to be 100% happy with your decision to pre-order Bodu knives!After the campaign ends, IndieGoGo sends us (Bodu) the funds raised which we use to manufacture and deliver the knives to you.Manufacturing is ready to go. We do not expect any significant delivery delays. TIMELINEMANUFACTURING STATUSThanks to our early backers here on IndieGoGo, we have started the first phase of manufacturing ahead of schedule!The images below show how the sand cast handles are meticulously hand welded to the blades for strength, durability, and precision.ABOUT USWe want to create products that we use every day and that others would want as well. We want art and function in our lives and hands every day. We started with kitchen knives because they are the essential tools in a kitchen. We turned to Damani Thomas, owner and head chef of Oswald Restaurant in Santa Cruz, CA for assistance in selecting which knives would be most valued for the home cook.Thank you for your support! We know you are going to love your Bodu knives as much as we do. They are truly works of art for everyday use.Questions or comments?Let us know. We're here to help!

<h2><strong>Designed with Birds' Health In Mind</strong></h2>
</div><h3>ClearView Deluxe provides the safest feeding environment available!  </h3><p>Bird-borne diseases (like Salmonella) typically spread through contaminated fecal matter from infected birds. Poorly maintained bird feeders and bird baths are strongly suspected as the primary culprits for the spread of the diseases, as birds congregate at these high-traffic areas and infect others. </p><h3>Many people don't realize that as good as their intentions are, by not regularly sanitizing their feeders they are harming birds.</h3><p>These areas are contaminated when birds step in their own or another bird’s feces and then share perches or, in some cases, walk in and amongst their feed.  Sadly, many die within a day or two of being infected.</p><p>The best way to protect birds from diseases like Salmonella is through regular, intensive cleaning of your feeder(s).  In my experience, none of the feeders I have purchased in the past make for an easy cleaning and maintenance routine.    We've made it much easier to care for your feeder and your birds!</p><p> </p><h3><strong>You can make a difference one feeder at a time with ClearView Deluxe embedded with NatureCare®!</strong></h3><p>For more information on bird health and our innovative design –</p><p><a href=""https://www.clearviewbirds.com/birdhealth"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.clearviewbirds.com/birdhealth</a></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1632068804/igfbd7mxugqaepjeny3m.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3><p>Our innovative, modern 2-part interlocking design is produced via injection molding instead of simply gluing together or heat bending acrylic sheet like cheaper competitors, so we're looking for funds from pre-orders to help defray the cost for the more expensive thermoplastic molds required to manufacture the feeder as well as to conduct lab tests to confirm the efficacy of the antimicrobial.</p><p>Some friends have told me that most people won't care and will just buy the cheapest feeder they can find.  I'm convinced there is a market for people who want to protect birds and purchase a premium product that will look better and last longer.</p><p>Even if you are not able to back us today, please forward to other people or groups that you believe are also concerned about nature, animals' and birds' health.</p><h3>Together we can make a difference to provide more hygienic food and water sources for our feathered friends!</h3><p> </p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kw8f1XKFe1Y?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><h2> </h2><h2><strong>Early Bird Offer!</strong></h2><p>Designed by Bird Lovers for Bird Lovers, we're proud to say <strong>ClearView is made exclusively in the U.S.A. </strong> The price of the feeder will be generally released at $37.  <strong>We are offering an Early Bird price for $31, or save and buy two for $59.</strong></p><p>Share with a friend or family member to help them protect their birds as well!

Our focus was to design a window-mounted feeder where you could actually see the birds that come to visit (instead of trying to look around or past suction cups) – we decided to call it ClearView Deluxe! Inventor, Craig Wacaser, showing the 100% unobstructed view.We decided we could design a feeder with birds' health in mind.  So we set to work. Vision DrawingsSuction Cups are off-set for a 100% Totally Clear View!The seed compartment is physically separated from the water.  Rainwater is channeled down the sides into the water bays.The dishwasher safe interlocking removable tray makes ClearView Deluxe the easiest feeder to clean and maintain of any feeder on the market.  Prototype PhotosThese photos are actual pictures of my prototype on my backyard window. The prototype shown is a 3D SLA (Stereolithography) print of the ClearView Deluxe feeder. The final product will be transparent acrylic (even more clear).    Notice the suction cups are offset for a 100% unobstructed view of your birds. Having the cups spread out on the sides also allows for a stronger hold on the window. CompetitionAs a comparison, here is a picture of the top-selling acrylic feeder on Amazon:What do you notice from the picture? You can barely see the birds because the suction cups are in the way!   Why would anyone make a window feeder where the suction cups are blocking the view of the birds you want to see?
Here is a video of the feeders side by side - ClearView is on the left - Amazon's top seller on the right.  It's a Clear Choice the one you'd rather have on your window!
 
Proof of Clarity! In absolutely clear contrast, one day I was able to capture this amazing photo of a male cardinal coming in for landing on my ClearView prototype.  I posted it on my local NextDoor app and received over 4000 reactions.  I knew then that others would also appreciate a totally clear view of birds, and it would be the perfect image for my logo.Here is another totally clear video of three baby bluebirds coming in for (sometimes awkward) landings on my first ClearView prototype (white - not transparent prototype). 

 
Designed with Birds' Health In Mind
ClearView Deluxe provides the safest feeding environment available!  Bird-borne diseases (like Salmonella) typically spread through contaminated fecal matter from infected birds. Poorly maintained bird feeders and bird baths are strongly suspected as the primary culprits for the spread of the diseases, as birds congregate at these high-traffic areas and infect others. Many people don't realize that as good as their intentions are, by not regularly sanitizing their feeders they are harming birds.These areas are contaminated when birds step in their own or another bird’s feces and then share perches or, in some cases, walk in and amongst their feed.  Sadly, many die within a day or two of being infected.The best way to protect birds from diseases like Salmonella is through regular, intensive cleaning of your feeder(s).  In my experience, none of the feeders I have purchased in the past make for an easy cleaning and maintenance routine.    We've made it much easier to care for your feeder and your birds! You can make a difference one feeder at a time with ClearView Deluxe embedded with NatureCare®!For more information on bird health and our innovative design –https://www.clearviewbirds.com/birdhealth  What We Need & What You GetOur innovative, modern 2-part interlocking design is produced via injection molding instead of simply gluing together or heat bending acrylic sheet like cheaper competitors, so we're looking for funds from pre-orders to help defray the cost for the more expensive thermoplastic molds required to manufacture the feeder as well as to conduct lab tests to confirm the efficacy of the antimicrobial.Some friends have told me that most people won't care and will just buy the cheapest feeder they can find.  I'm convinced there is a market for people who want to protect birds and purchase a premium product that will look better and last longer.Even if you are not able to back us today, please forward to other people or groups that you believe are also concerned about nature, animals' and birds' health.Together we can make a difference to provide more hygienic food and water sources for our feathered friends!  Early Bird Offer!Designed by Bird Lovers for Bird Lovers, we're proud to say ClearView is made exclusively in the U.S.A.  The price of the feeder will be generally released at $37.  We are offering an Early Bird price for $31, or save and buy two for $59.Share with a friend or family member to help them protect their birds as well! ClearView Deluxe would be a great and thoughtful gift for them AND their bird friends.  When you buy two you save 20% AND get free shipping AND anti-strike bird window decals.",12.0,5,"1 Campaign

She thus created a single receptacle for the parent plant and cuttings with a well-thought-out design to keep the cuttings in place and add a decorative accent to the home.Greenfinity was bornBelow are shipping estimates for 1x Greenfinity set for some main geographical areas.Please note that these are estimates and the actual costs of shipping could change based on many circumstances.*Shipping will be charged after the campaign in the post-campaign survey according to your address.*Shipping charges mentioned are estimates, final shipping charges will appear on the post-campaign survey and may vary slightly from these estimates.*""Rest of world"" prices depend on proximity to our EU, US and HK fulfillment centers.*We make our products available to users the world over but please note the product’s price and shipping estimation do not include possible customs duties and other additional taxes that may apply in your country.Indiegogo enables creators and innovators to propose their product ideas ahead of the market and at a reduced price.

Deeper Connect Nano - also available on IGG!ON-THE-GO | SAME POWERFUL FEATURES BUT SMALLER | PLUG-AND-PLAY




Finally,  a lifetime VPN solution that just works. Pay once, no subscriptions. Decentralized VPN is serverless and distributed; user data can never be logged, leaked, hacked, or subpoenaed. A layer 7 firewall secures the user's entire home/business network. It blocks ads and trackers, monitors web traffic, and filters NSFW, NSFC on all internet devices.
At Deeper, we embrace net neutrality and believe private and secure access to an uncensored internet is a fundamental human right. We want to get Deeper Connects into as many people’s hands as possible. We are able to offer lifetime access to our DPN service to Indiegogo backers as a special thank you. Deeper Network's business model is the sales of hardware and enterprise licensing of firewall security features and not the sales of your data. Plug & play hardware combined with an intuitive user interface ensures privacy and security are approachable for everyone. To learn more about DPN, please refer to this article ""A 101 on DPNs"": https://deeper-network.medium.com/a-101-on-dpns... IMPORTANT NOTICE

Plug-N-Play with Zero Configuration
 
The design concept of Deeper Connect is true plug-and-play with zero configuration. The installation process is so simple even grandparents can do it in 5 seconds. Users only need to plug in two ethernet cables to gain access to a free, secure, and private Internet. There is no need for users to be aware of its existence afterward.

 
Easy To Setup

3 Ways to Set Up:
A. Cable Outlet -> Deeper Connect -> Laptop (only applicable to laptop computers with Ethernet ports, or to be used with a USB to Ethernet adapter)
B. Modem -> Deeper Connect -> Router
C. Integrated WiFi Modem All-in-One -> Deeper Connect -> Router (requires an additional standalone WiFi router)

                                      In the Decentralized Private Network (DPN), each device serves as both client and server and their IP address will be automatically changed based on their routing rules. Deeper Connect can establish up to 16 tunnels to other nodes all over the world. By default, they will be established in the US, Europe, Singapore, and China. Consider Alice (Germany) who wants to access US Netflix. Her device will automatically borrow Bob’s residential IP address (US) to avoid being geo-blocked. At the same time, Tom’s device in China will be borrowing Alice’s IP address (Germany) to access YouTube. This of course is a huge and dynamic network composed of thousands of Alices, Bobs, and Toms, which allows every user to browse the internet without restrictions and bypassing firewalls and censorship, all automatically done by Deeper technology.  Comparing with traditional VPN,  DPN has the following advantages:
No centralized servers; the network cannot be taken down.
Users have control over their own data; encrypted and secured.
Democratic Internet that ensures net neutrality; censorship-resistant.
High-speed Internet connection without bottlenecks.
                                       Smart routing refers to the automatic configuration of network routing based on data stream characteristics, and whether to transmit through a tunnel. IP address will be changed based on the user routing rules and tunnels will be established to the US, EU, SG and CN by default.If a user wants, for example, to access Youku while in the USA, the Deeper Connect will automatically create a smart route through China. However, the user has the option to define a smart route through India (for whatever reason). Conversely, if a user in China desires to access Netflix, a smart route will be established automatically through the USA, but he/she has the option to define a smart route through Canada instead (perhaps because of his subscription or preference of regional show availability).                                       Deeper Connect is a smart secure gateway that offers enterprise-grade cybersecurity with 7 layers of deep packet inspection; a sleek interface allows for visualization of all online activities happening on the network.                                       Deeper Connect can protect all your IoT devices as a secure gateway between your home and the external Internet. It will protect all your home devices such as PCs, smartphones, and security cameras from online threats. Our product has been designed by top-level network security and distributed systems experts. The company's core technical team are veterans from Google, Palo Alto Networks, VMware, and other industry-leading companies.                                      Say goodbye to all those annoying ads. Deeper Connect's powerful network security features can deeply filter user network traffic and effectively block ads, trackers, and malware across the entire network for all your devices. Users will be able to view how many trackers have been blocked by Deeper Connect. Normally These trackers follow, record, store, and repackage your internet history and then sell it to third parties. Every time you browse, someone else is taking notes. The more they know about you the easier it is for these companies to trigger certain reactions with ads or any other content for purchasing or other purposes. Deeper Connect protects you from these trackers.                                       We know you care about the well-being of your kids, and you want to make sure they are not exposed to adult or violent content when they are on the internet. Aligning with your values and in concordance with our fair and transparent internet vision, we offer simple and effective parental control, by which a single click from you will enable/disable a filter for pornography content websites.                                       The Deeper Connect dashboard allows you to visualize in real-time the multi-tunneling capabilities of our device. You will see a pictorial representation of all the tunnels that have been either automatically set by the system or chosen by you (remember that you can establish up to 16 tunnels worldwide).Deeper Connect also has a seven-layer traffic scanning function that allows you to visualize real-time traffic usage. Whenever there are programs running and using network data, the flow usage will be reflected in the flow page of the device management interface.                                                            We do not own any centralized servers as every Deeper Connect is in essence a server and a client. All these devices distribute around the world to communicate and share bandwidth with each other.Every user can set a limit to the amount of bandwidth he/she wants to share with other users. One advantage is that users can receive credits for sharing their bandwidth to later exchange them for Deeper Network services, which include monthly software updates. This form of sharing economy has the advantage to benefit the users who contribute to the sharing, without the need of a middle man mediating the transactions or charging fees.   Deeper Connect is a hybrid device combining different technologies, but under the hood, it is also a remarkable and powerful computer. As part of its hardware, it sports a powerful Quad- cores processor and 2048MB memory to maximize its throughput. We are talking about a Layer 7 next-generation firewall with a throughput of 1Gbps. Currently, there are no other devices with this level of performance at this price level in the market. This enables Deeper Connect Mini to provide all your home devices protection and encryption, with breathtaking speeds. Deeper Connect Nano also runs on a powerful Quad-core processor, with a 1GB memory. The small yet powerful device can reach a maximum speed of 500 Mbps. Great for hotel use when on the go. Seamless ConnectivityUnlike traditional VPNs, Deeper Connect can identify and seamlessly switch tunnel connections on the fly to bypass any region-restricted content.  When a tunnel connection is no longer needed, Smart Route mode will automatically switch back to the user's default IP connection to optimize speed. This function ensures that the user is always connected to the fastest possible connection at any given time while freely browsing and streaming content from around the globe. Enterprise-Class Security: Particularly attractive are Deeper’s enterprise-class security features. Deeper Connect makes use of the network security operating system AtomOS, with a lock-free design. The device is capable of achieving the level and performance of enterprise-class products at a very low cost. Products of similar specifications, such as a Palo Alto Network device, may cost more than $10,000 USD. Currently, Deeper Network is targeting the network security market for the general public.HomeWith Deeper Connect we envision our users being able to access any website at any time within the comfort of their home, without worrying about being banned by an ISP. Users’ home networks will have 360° security protection, including all IoT devices.  TravelFor those that need to travel abroad and may find restrictions accessing the content they need or need to have a secure browning experience when connecting to unsecured WiFi networks in airports, cafes, or other public spaces, we have ideated a solution for them. These users will have the option to download AtomOS, our operating system which will allow them to connect remotely to their own Deeper Connect. They can then use their laptops to connect any other terminal devices, like cellphones, tablets, etc., creating a private and secure umbrella for all of them, having also the benefits of a Decentralized Private Network. This is the perfect portable device you can use at your hotel room just connecting to an internet outlet.  We understand that there are several solutions out there offering privacy and security online. Nonetheless, it is important to differentiate ourselves from these other services. We have been compared with Firewalla, the Winston, even a Raspberry configured as a pi-hole + Tor (smile). Our solution is much more ambitious and innovative.First, we offer cybersecurity at an enterprise level, Deeper Connect integrates seven layers of security functions, something that has never been available to the general public. Part of our developing team had leadership positions at Palo Alto Network and Fortinet, the biggest cybersecurity companies in the world. Since the beginning, they had the vision to offer a device with a high level of security and protection.Secondly, our device is also a truly Decentralized Private Network, we are offering a technology superior to any current VPN.Finally, none of those devices offer a sharing economy or the option to exchange bandwidth with other users. We are a few significant steps ahead of other products in the market.  Deeper Connect Mini represents the accumulated knowledge ofover three years of active development. Deeper Connect Mini is our 4th generation device. We have learned a lot in this journey, and this effort is reflected in the quality of our product: a much more compact and aesthetic design, and in its improved privacy and security functions.We envision the Deeper Network project back in 2018 Q2. By 2019 Q1, we had already a Beta release of AtomOS, the world's first lock-free network security operating system. And during the next quarter (Q2 of 2019) we had already completed our home hardware security gateway fully equipped with AtomOS. In 2019 Q3 our 3rd generation device went officially on sale. Now we are proud to offer our 4th generation device, Deeper Connect Mini.                                                         Deeper Network is a cybersecurity company based in Silicon Valley.
