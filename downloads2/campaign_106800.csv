<h3>What is Just A Slice?</h3>
<p>Just A Slice is an impromptu web-series (8 episodes, 30-45 minutes), about a group of people getting together to do something they used to do as a kid, for fun. </p>
<p>I think about my childhood a lot. From cartoon shows, to elementary school field trips, to pizza parties, to game nights, to Halloween, etc. </p>
<p>I've always wanted to create a project that allowed me to not only venture back into my childhood, but venture into other people's childhood as well. </p>
<p>I've never been so passionate about a project before. With recent events in the US, I felt a strong urge to make this web-series happen. I cannot do it without your generous support. </p>
<p>There's this thought, in the world, that in order to accomplish one's calling, purpose or goals, they need to abandon the child-like qualities inside of them. Which is not true.</p>
<p>If anything, your child-like characteristics allow you to accomplish your calling, your purpose or your goals. </p>
<p>""Imagine if all adults brought a child-like energy to their workplaces, their organizations, and the pursuit of their own goals? We would definitely see a sharp increase in productivity and innovation.""</p>
<p>(Ayodeji Awosika, 2015). From his article: ""7 Childlike Traits We Should Recapture To Live A Happier Life"". </p>
<p>This web-series will be dedicated to my Mom, who died after her 4-year battle with breast cancer in August 2019. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1592426087/b21d74lnifxhphpn8azh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>Those that knew her knew how amazing she was. She was a positive light in so many people's lives. Including mine. When you were around her, you were the most important person in the room. Her death affected me greatly. If there's anything I can do, it's doing the best dedication I can for her. Which I cannot do without your support. </p>

<h3>What's the Funding For?</h3>
<p>$8000 is the minimum needed to make the web-series happen. Below is how the $8000 will be used:</p>
<p>5% will go to Indiegogo (Platform fee, all crowdfunding campaigns have them)</p>
<p>11% will go to Audio Equipment</p>
<p>25% will go to the Animated Intro (Intros are an important element to any project, it's what gets the viewers interest and helps set the tone, feeling and themes that will be present in the project)</p>
<p>59% will go to Crew Pay</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We want Season 1 to be the best that it can be. Though $8,000 is what we need to make Season 1 happen, more funds can allow us to do much more. Below are a few stretch goals that will help us make Season 1 great:</p>
<p><b>REACH $9,200 </b>- Original Music for the web-series (I believe, if used in moderation, music can add tremendous depth to a project. It can sometimes wash over so much stuff and become unnecessary cues for moments in a project. I am always careful about the amount of music used in a project of mine because more often than not, music isn't needed to move a scene, clip or segment along.  And I wouldn't want hard work put into something that the dialogue is doing well with. I do believe that with this particular project, music can be of use in certain parts.)</p>
<p><strong>REACH $9,983 </strong>- Bonus Episode with a special intro as a thank you to everyone who contributed/helped make this project possible! </p>
<p><strong>REACH $11,549 </strong>- Another bonus episode that includes bloopers, behind the scenes snippets and so much more!</p>
<p><b>REACH $14,549 </b>- A release of a shelved project in a digital art format!</p>
<p><b>REACH $17, 349 </b>- A special animated project as a sincere thank you to those that helped contribute this!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>The web-series is currently in pre-production. Production will begin in September. Depending on the information that the CDC puts out, it may/may not affect our ability to begin production in September. If things change, we will begin production in January of next year. Though I would definitely love to start in September, the safety and well-being of others is important. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Sharing the campaign helps tremendously. It's ultimately how others can see it and gets the word out. This truly helps. Even if you cannot contribute, please spread the word to others you know.</p>

We also risk missing our pitch with three major networks.  Currently, we have a team of over 30 hard at work prepping for what many feel could be the next big thing on TV.  After winning multiple awards for the realism, and love portrayed through the characters, this is just the next step.  All cast and crew feel deeply about this story, and hope that you will contribute to help make this  a reality.  The next step in the Reclaimed Freedom series.Other Ways You Can HelpCan't afford at the moment to help us? No problem, we appreciate you taking the time to consider! Please help us in other ways:Get the word out about the campaign to anyone that you think can help.  Remember, even a simple $1 will inch us closer to goal.Come to our Table Read of the pilot and Pitch on Monday, February 6th at Redline Bar and Lounge in downtown Los Angeles,Get Involved. We need cast and crew to help produce the pilot. Don't want to work on the crew? Then get involved locally - help sponsor an addict. An addict needs your help near you. CHECK OUT PREVIOUS CAMPAIGN VIDEOS!Stanton Longoria & Tim Younger: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JroVMQCK2g8Ben Lewin & Sonai Grace: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVsIJoT4ll0THE CAST THANKS YOUEach of us thanks you from the bottom of our hearts. Reclaimed Freedom was conceived and written by Kenne-James. Thanks Again for your support!",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p><strong>A strong woman in the military </strong>is not a story you hear often. Ask yourself, how many TV series or movies focused around the military or war have you seen with the leading role being a female? Chances are you can count how many you’ve seen them on one hand.</p>
<p>The truth is that there are hundreds of untold stories of amazing women who have accomplished just as much as any man in the military, and that’s why we want your help backing this TV series project based on the fascinating life of Colonel Jill Morgenthaler. As you can imagine, there is a lot that goes into getting a project like this sold and produced to a network. We have a great team of writers on board and the money gained will help us start the screenwriting process for G.I. Jill and getting the script sold to a studio. Help us tell the story of one woman’s difficult struggles and heroic triumphs to accomplish many firsts for a woman in the military.</p>
<p><strong>What is G.I. Jill About?</strong></p>
<p>Inspired by the real stories of Colonel (Ret.) Jill Morgenthaler’s time in the Army, we are creating a 6-part miniseries that highlights one woman's journey through being one of the first women enlisted in the Army. Each episode will focus on a part of her journey, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Surviving boot camp when the men didn't want her there</li>
<li>Being forced into a beauty contest</li>
<li>Saving an American engineer from being kidnapped by the USSR</li>
<li>Coming face-to-face with Saddam Hussein during his war crimes trial</li>
</ul>
<p>All stories are based on real events and bring to light many issues that women in the military still encounter today. Colonel Morgenthaler is considered a hero and exceptional leader by her fellow service men and women. The obstacles she overcame are what promises to be a compelling story of strength, courage, and perseverance. - This is a true underdog story that proves one woman can stand and be a voice for not just thousands of women who serve in our military, but to anyone who has a dream and will fight like hell to prove everyone wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Your Duty</strong></p>
<p>We are asking you to help fund our project and help us raise $25,000 for the initial screenwriting of this exclusive 6-part TV miniseries. As a backer, you will receive a set of unique perks based on how much you decide to generously donate. Please see the perks section for more details on what you will receive.</p>
<p>We truly feel that this is a story that needs to be told and heard, especially during these fragile times that prove gender equality is still an important issue. Help us show the world that a strong leader doesn't have to be one size fits all.</p>
<p><strong>One Final Note</strong></p>
<p>My name is Jill Morgenthaler and this is a project based on my journey, my many ups and downs, my fight for respect, and my fight for my life - I am very excited to make this TV miniseries and am confident all of you will enjoy the final product. Thank you for your help.</p>

However, now we want more. We want to take Zoolaplex out of your RSS feed and throw it at the screen like a digital Jackson Pollock painting. How? Three words: 'Hostile Work Environment', our very own animated pilot episode! We don’t have any deals set up and we barely have a nice word to say about ourselves, but we have an Indiegogo campaign, and we know what we want to do.</p><p>Not convinced yet? Bear with us.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486667230/xvh6dn69stbqxyahco25.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Here’s the deal: we make jokes about movies, modern life, first world problems and cultural stereotypes, while highlighting social issues and seeking to inspire people with fresh perspectives and real, relatable characters with their own unique opinions and different experiences. There’s dirty jokes, internet memes, pop culture references and parodies, and a whole lot of F-bombs being thrown around. The Zoolaplex world is a little different—the minimum wage is $13, street gangs play in underground fighting rings to pay for college tuition, and you can whack a guy with a baseball bat for attacking your coworker. All in all, it sucks about as much as the real world does.</p><p>In the first 12 episodes of our critically-acclaimed audio-drama alone [SPOILER ALERT] a racist ass-cactus gets his nose caved in, the multiplex is swarmed with a mob of hipsters (who aren’t so bad after all), and a sexual predator gets decked by a con artist with a beer bottle. Our second season has taken it up a notch with themes of mental illness, body positivity, and the power of a family that loves each other, even if they’re not related. All of these themes and events tie into the core message of our show. It's a message that has become very important to remember in recent months:</p><p>We don’t have to like each other, but we can at least respect each other.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1486667297/u2s4s4a9ydgomqbetera.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>We love what we’ve made so far, but we’re not satisfied. With the current state of the political world and the recent outbreak of closed-mindedness that’s swept the world, we believe our message needs to be heard now more than ever, and we can’t do that from the Podcasts app on your iPhone. We’ve never had the resources to have our show animated, and that’s where YOU come in. If you help us reach our target of $16,000, we’ll use it to make something beautiful.</p><p>We want to make an all-new, fully-animated series pilot, with new music, an innovative animation style, and redesigned characters, something that’ll start the ball rolling for us to make our dream of sharing Zoolaplex with the world a reality. Our plan is simple: with the money raised with this campaign, we will create 'Hostile Work Environment', our pilot episode, and we will take it to Hollywood, to the studios themselves, anywhere we can get our foot in the door.

WRONG! Our project has no set focus on any stretch goals. All we can do is promise that every dollar we receive above our target of $16,000 will be used to make the show better in some way. Maybe we’ll spruce up the credits sequence. Maybe we’ll make a full trailer showcasing what might happen in the first complete season. Maybe we’ll hire Patton Oswalt to pop up and say ‘penis’ at random intervals—he seems like he’d be down to do it. He’s a chill guy. But no matter what we decide to do with our extra budget, we’ll make sure it’s put to good use to make 'Hostile Work Environment' as amazing as we can.</p><p>Instead of focusing on stretch goals, we’re going to do something else to stretch our success: backer challenges. We want 'Hostile Work Environment' to spread like wildfire, and not for more money, but in the hopes that it’ll attract the attention of people at the big production studios and networks that might be interested in talking to us about making Zoolaplex into an original series. Let’s face it; the people have to want this for us to get anywhere, and this is how we’ll prove they do. Below is a set of 12 challenges that backers can take on social media to help spread this project around. If our backers and supporters complete 9 challenges out of all 12, we’ll unlock a special bonus event and add a new set of challenges for something even better!

Should we not manage to achieve our goal, then one of two things will happen. If we didn't get far at all, we vow to use that money to further the production of the audio drama, better promote the show for another year or two, and then return stronger, wiser, and with a bigger fanbase. But if we were just shy of the mark, over, say, 70%, then we will actively continue to raise money from external investors and bank interest, until we have enough to finance the pilot anyway. And we'll be keeping everyone who backed us in the first place in the know the whole time! Not a single cent of this money will be wasted under any circumstances!</p><p> </p><p><u>Q: And if you do reach the goal? What happens then?</u></p><p>A: We get to work! As soon as the writing is finalised, we'll send it over to be storyboarded and get the voice actors on it to set up an animatic, and then when that's set we send it off to the animators to be animated. When it's all put together, we add sound effects, make sure it's all 100% perfect, and then add music to bring it all together. And then, well, 'Hostile Work Environment' is done! Next comes the bigger challenge: getting the networks on the phone... But that's an entirely different adventure!</p><p> </p><p><u>Q: Why $16,000? That's higher than a lot of campaigns for animated pilots!</u></p><p>A: That's very true, but most animation campaigns are run by people who are talented animators themselves, and unfortunately Reece Bridger is not an animator, nor is he that talented. Where his skill set ends, other people will pick up the slack, and that requires money. For professional quality animation, music and voice acting, considerable industry-level funding is required.</p><p> </p><p><u>Q: So who's involved in this? I don't want my money going to untrustworthy third parties!</u></p><p>A: Well, you're in luck! No one involved in this project is untrustworthy, nor are they really third parties! Everyone involved is incredibly enthusiastic to work on this, and we consider them friends of the studio itself! So, aside from our talented cast and Reece himself, we've enlisted the help of talented musician and composer Mark Little to produce the soundtrack; storyboard artist Leah Kleinbeck to lay the foundation for the visuals; and our art director Russ Adams of Escape Design FX, whose résumés includes 'Beetlejuice', 'Pirates of the Caribbean' 2 &amp; 3, and 'Jim Henson's Creature Shop Challenge', who will ensure 'Hostile Work Environment' is completely TV-ready!</p><p> </p><p><u>Q: Who did all the art for this IndieGoGo campaign?</u></p><p>A: I'm glad you asked! All the art assets for this campaign were taken from old pieces or drawn specifically for this project, and those lovely artists are: Stefi Delly, Stephanie Jo Keuls, Cas Flores, Amy Summers, Leah Kleinbeck, and a hyena. Yes. A hyena. Long story.</p><p> </p><p><u>Q: I'm a blogger/podcast host/writer for a news and culture website and I want to help spread the word about this project.

<p><strong>What’s Happening?</strong></p>
<p>In early 2018, we’re launching a YouTube series called Contemplate Truth. The series will examine subjects such as evolution and the creation of the universe, all from a Christian perspective.</p>
<p>Our belief is that high schoolers and college students are the ones most in need of this resource. Their faith is tested on a daily basis as they face anti-God ideology almost everywhere they turn. Because so many students are on YouTube, we believe it’s the perfect medium for this series.</p>
<p>While there are resources out there addressing these questions, most of them are so densely packed with scientific jargon that the content goes over the head of anyone without a PhD. For most of us, that’s not helpful. So, we’re making these videos with our audience in mind. Not only will the information be easy to understand, but it’ll be presented in a fun and engaging way.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our Plan</strong></p>
<p>We’re creating 5 episodes for the first season of Contemplate Truth. Each episode will range from 3-7 minutes in length in order to have the broadest appeal.</p>
<p>While the topics of the five episodes have not been finalized yet, we know we’re going to be looking closely at both evolution and intelligent design. In future seasons, we’d like to address questions people ask in the YouTube comments. If you have a topic you’re curious about, please let us know by leaving a comment on this site.</p>
<p>We wait faithfully to see what God has in store for this series, but our plan is to continue making episodes and release them on a consistent basis if the initial season gathers interest.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Host</strong></p>
<p>John Zino is currently a Senior Engineering Manager at GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy in Wilmington, NC and has over thirty years of technical and management experience in government laboratories and private industry. He holds undergraduate and graduate degrees in nuclear engineering and physics from North Carolina State University and the Georgia Institute of Technology as well as a PhD in nuclear engineering from Georgia Tech. John is currently pursuing an MA in Science &amp; Religion from Biola University and hopes to teach, lecture and publish works useful to Christians as they encounter a culture strongly influenced by scientific material naturalism.<br/><br/>John came to salvation in Christ on Easter Sunday in 1978 as a teenager while visiting Myrtle Beach, SC with his family. Although he struggled with his faith early in college while studying science and engineering, he eventually came to realize that the pursuit of science and belief in God are not mutually exclusive but complementary. John’s goal working with college and high school students is to help put into proper context an integrated understanding of science and faith for the next generation of young Christians.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What Is Needed</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to craft each episode to be as effective at communicating complex ideas as possible. That requires a lot of intentionality behind the scenes. From writing to computer animation, these things cost money to be done sufficiently. Additionally, there are resources such as hard drives and music licensing that need to be purchased to make things happen.</p>
<p>So, we invite you to contribute. Without your support, this series won’t be possible. But imagine the positive difference that can be made in the lives of so many people, both Christian and non-Christian, with this resource. Even you may have questions that we'll address in these videos. So let’s bring this series to life, together!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Support</strong></p>
<p>There are two other ways you can help us with this series.</p>
<p>First, prayer. Pray that God puts this resource in front of people who need to see it, and pray that we address the questions that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>Second, sharing. We ask that you share this series on social media, tell your friends about it, do whatever you can to get it in front of more people.</p>
<p>Thank you for even considering joining us in this adventure. We’re looking forward to seeing what God does next! </p>

<h3> </h3>
<p>Established in 2015, founder Rox Wright noticed the mother of her quartet of cousins struggling with managing their beautiful curls. The girls are of Thai and Caribbean heritage, which sees them blessed with extremely varied hair textures that at times mainstream hair advice doesn't always cater to. Inspired to combine and share over a decade of childcare expertise and hair care knowledge with the world, Wright launched Yindi Curls in a bid to help both parents and children learn to love their locks with compact classes for the curly masses.</p>
<p>Yindi Curls masterclasses are designed to offer support and advice to parents/carers of particularly – although not exclusively black and mixed heritage children, who want to learn about the techniques, products, and tools needed to care for their child’s hair more effectively. </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525687484/teodvs79fq9xqwov9odk.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>Initially set up as a bimonthly-day masterclass based in London, Yindi Curls is quickly becoming a unique destination for parents and carers of curly kids. </p>
<p>However, in response to feedback from our community, we've decided to create a subscription-based online course in conjunction with our Day Masterclasses, that parents and carers can access at any time from the comfort of their home or whilst on the go.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>What's included in the masterclass?</strong></p>
<p>The masterclass consists of 4 Series, which includes 16  episodes of in-depth tutorials, interviews and animated sketches. </p>
<p><strong>How do I access the content after buying the Masterclass?</strong></p>
<p>Once the payment process is completed and the Yindi Curls crowdfunding campaign has ended,  you will receive an email with personalised login details which can amend at any time. Access can be gained as of October 2018.</p>
<p><strong>How long do I have access?</strong></p>
<p>The content will never expire so you can log in and watch at any time, however, this access only applies to<i> <i>Indiegogo contributors only</i>.</i></p>
<p><strong>Is it a one-time payment or contract?</strong></p>
<p>Indiegogo customers pay the one-off contribution fee which will allow them unlimited access. Those that choose to purchase Yindi Curls classes via the Yindi Curls website will need to pay monthly in order to consistently gain access to Masterclass material. </p>
<p><strong>Do you do refunds?</strong></p>
<p>As Yindi Curls have opted for a flexible funding option, donations will not be refunded. If purchased directly from the Yindi Curls website, the Masterclass is a digital product, therefore, no refunds will be issued as you gain access instantly upon purchase.</p>
<p><strong>Does the Masterclass come with Hair Products?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Masterclass does not come with hair products. You will need to use your own.</p>
<p><strong>What are the risks?</strong></p>
<p>Because we are already up and running, and hosting day workshops on a regular basis, there is minimal direct risk associated with our perks that consist of private sessions. We’ll send any vouchers and perks under the value of £50 as soon as the campaign finishes in mid-June.</p>
<p>For physical perks and online masterclass access, you’ll have to wait slightly longer as we are creating them as we go along. The official launch date should be at the end of the year but people who have purchased it via the campaign will receive them exclusively by October 2018! </p>
<p><strong>When will I receive my perks?</strong></p>
<p>Once the campaign finishes in mid-June, we'll start shipping perks under the value of £50 first, so you should expect them between late July/August. For those that purchase merchandise based perks alongside masterclass access, your orders will be processed between August and September.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What about shipping?</strong></p>
<p>Our shipping cost will vary based on country. We are based in the UK, so we will use Royal Mail to send in the UK at low cost. For shipping abroad, we’ll also use Royal Mail.</p>
<p>The cost of postage and packaging will be added to your original donation near the end of your transaction. </p>
<p> </p>

</div><p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Yindi Curls Crowdfund Campaign Video: Director: Ashleigh Jadee/Music: Chicago- Joe Bagale</i></p></div>","Established in 2015, founder Rox Wright noticed the mother of her quartet of cousins struggling with managing their beautiful curls. The girls are of Thai and Caribbean heritage, which sees them blessed with extremely varied hair textures that at times mainstream hair advice doesn't always cater to. Inspired to combine and share over a decade of childcare expertise and hair care knowledge with the world, Wright launched Yindi Curls in a bid to help both parents and children learn to love their locks with compact classes for the curly masses.
Yindi Curls masterclasses are designed to offer support and advice to parents/carers of particularly – although not exclusively black and mixed heritage children, who want to learn about the techniques, products, and tools needed to care for their child’s hair more effectively. 
 

 

 
Initially set up as a bimonthly-day masterclass based in London, Yindi Curls is quickly becoming a unique destination for parents and carers of curly kids. 
However, in response to feedback from our community, we've decided to create a subscription-based online course in conjunction with our Day Masterclasses, that parents and carers can access at any time from the comfort of their home or whilst on the go.
Here are some of the subjects we cover: 

and much more!
So simply put, we want to create an online workshop series that consists of...

What makes us different?
We are not a hairdressing school. Yindi Curls is a unique space and community for guardians to educate themselves on their child's hair care. 
 

 

Ashleigh Jadee & URG Films
Production
IG: @msashleighjadee
 London videographer Ashleigh has filmed and directed for numerous brands, music artists and fledgling businesses alike. These include Jasmine Thompson, Big Sean, French Montana, Rita Ora, Tinie Tempah, Tyga, Iggy Azalea, Mac Miller and more. This led to her filming performance music videos for online platforms such as Linkup TV & GRM Daily. Ashleigh has also produced content for brands and artist such as Beats by Dre, Luxoticca, Skepta, Stormzy, G Frsh, BET UK and more, but always felt most at home in the director's chair.
Founded in 2017, URG Films is dedicated to creating content that aims to inspire. From documentaries to music videos to films, they pride themselves on only creating content that educates, uplifts and promotes positivity. Whether in front of the camera or behind it, they work with a diverse range of talent, both well known and up and coming, from all walks of life.
 

 
Our initial funding target is £12,000. This will be broken down into the following categories:



Studio Hire: £1,560 will help us secure the studio space costs for the 7 days we plan on filming.  (£2,600 if we stretch our goal)

Videography/ Post Production: £5,400 (£9,000 if we stretch our goal) enables us to not only film all 16 episodes of the Yindi online course but include...Video Editing 
Adding Visual Effects
Sound Design, sound effects, ADR, foley, and music, culminating in a process known as sound re-recording or mixing with professional audio equipment.
Color Grading


Donation Perks: £600 allows us to produce your perks to the highest quality and get them to you in the safest and fastest method possible. (£1,000 if we stretch our goal)

Promotion: £1,200 we know our community is great at spreading the word, but this will assist us in reaching those further afield.

 Set Design: £1,440 From props to equipment hire, this budget will allow us to create professional looking content. (£2,400 if we stretch our goal)

Cast & Crew: £1,800 enables us to cover travel, refreshments and most importantly insurance for those working with us day to day on set.

 
However, if we hit our stretch target of £20,000 we'll be able to create...

We’ve also collaborated with:


 
We have created some amazing perks and products for you to purchase and contribute to this campaign.

What's included in the masterclass?
The masterclass consists of 4 Series, which includes 16  episodes of in-depth tutorials, interviews and animated sketches. 
How do I access the content after buying the Masterclass?
Once the payment process is completed and the Yindi Curls crowdfunding campaign has ended,  you will receive an email with personalised login details which can amend at any time. Access can be gained as of October 2018.
How long do I have access?
The content will never expire so you can log in and watch at any time, however, this access only applies to Indiegogo contributors only.
Is it a one-time payment or contract?
Indiegogo customers pay the one-off contribution fee which will allow them unlimited access. Those that choose to purchase Yindi Curls classes via the Yindi Curls website will need to pay monthly in order to consistently gain access to Masterclass material. 
Do you do refunds?
As Yindi Curls have opted for a flexible funding option, donations will not be refunded. If purchased directly from the Yindi Curls website, the Masterclass is a digital product, therefore, no refunds will be issued as you gain access instantly upon purchase.
Does the Masterclass come with Hair Products?
Unfortunately, the Masterclass does not come with hair products. You will need to use your own.
What are the risks?
Because we are already up and running, and hosting day workshops on a regular basis, there is minimal direct risk associated with our perks that consist of private sessions. We’ll send any vouchers and perks under the value of £50 as soon as the campaign finishes in mid-June.
For physical perks and online masterclass access, you’ll have to wait slightly longer as we are creating them as we go along. The official launch date should be at the end of the year but people who have purchased it via the campaign will receive them exclusively by October 2018! 
When will I receive my perks?
Once the campaign finishes in mid-June, we'll start shipping perks under the value of £50 first, so you should expect them between late July/August. For those that purchase merchandise based perks alongside masterclass access, your orders will be processed between August and September.
 
What about shipping?
Our shipping cost will vary based on country. We are based in the UK, so we will use Royal Mail to send in the UK at low cost. For shipping abroad, we’ll also use Royal Mail.
The cost of postage and packaging will be added to your original donation near the end of your transaction.

<p>Shakesha Williams created Curvy Girls Rock with the intention of giving women authentic representations in television. In contrast to the common narrative of women in film/television, which paints them to be passive, weak, and lacking in agency, the female leads of CGR are strong, independent, funny and ambitious. Shakesha believes that the characters of CGR are true reflections of the majority of women around the world, in both body image and individuality.   </p>
<p><br/>The goal of the series is to reinvent the narrative of women, forcing society to view them respectfully, as well as allow plus size women to see themselves depicted in ways that make them proud of their being.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p><br/>Vasilios Filippakis and Anthony Filangeri  here. We are, respectively, a creator/actor and a writer, here in Toronto. You may recognize one of us from that Swiss Chalet commercial, loving that Chalet sauce (obviously Vasilios, always thirsty) and a handful of indie projects. You might have read some WWE Articles, written by our very own Mr. Filangeri. Yes…WWE is still big thing. Having been acting/writing in Toronto now for a few years we joined forces in the summer of ’16 to create the story, now called, ""FAK YAASS""! We have teamed with Matthew McLaughlin, the owner of Bulldog Productions, who is on board to bring this to lyffffeeee; but we need you.</p>
<p><br/>Our campaign will raise the funding necessary to create the remaining 8 episodes of our 10 episodic web series (yes, that means EP 1 and EP 2 are complete) created by us and starring Vasilios and many other talented actors. Today is the time where actors and creators create their own work and make it happen! We find it liberating -creating your own work instead of sitting around, glued to your phone, waiting for that email from your agent (if you even have an agent…that’s a whole other story) to tell you you have an audition blarg blarg blarg…we think you get the point. </p>
<p><br/>How will all these amazing contributions help us? By reaching our goal we will be able to share this hilarious story that is grounded in love with all of you. We promise you will laugh, cry, get mad, shit yourself (this could actually happen, not our fault…)…really you’ll get all the feels. The potential this series has is outstanding. We already have interest from a major network production company to adapt the web series into a 30 minute network comedy! (It’s honestly so crazy and we're super thrilled) This web series is step one! All of you contributing play a huge role in the birth of ""FAK YAASS"" and will be there to watch it grow (you all can be proud parents). We could not do this without you! As we like to say, FAK. YAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $25, 000. This budget was made so we can pay all of our cast, crew and post production team (editing, marketing, etc). This is the bare bones of what we need to make this project happen. Nobody is walking away from this and heading off to a all inclusive resort for vacation. We believe that if we all work as a team, give some time, you'll get a little $$$; it really helps! The budget includes locations, food, gear, props, makeup, transportation, and wardrobe, for a 6 day shoot PLUS marketing once we finish!</p>
<p><br/><strong>Our Perks</strong><br/>If you donate $100 or more, you are invited to our exclusive PRIDE KICKOFF PARTY on June 15th! This means you’ll be on a guest list, enjoy drinks and hors d'oeuvres, see some of Toronto's top performers and walk the red carpet with all the other amazing Canadian talent we have in attendance!</p>
<p><br/>If you donate $500 you’ll get a coffee date with us, and some of the cast. YYAASSS. (as long as you live in the GTA)</p>
<p><br/>If you donate $1000, we will bartend shirtless at your next event and you will get an executive producer credit.  Ummm, how cool is that!?</p>
<p><br/>Check out the PERKS section after you read this and see all the ammmmazing perks offered.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>If the goal isn't reached, what happens to the money?</h3>
<p>We will make ""FAK YAASS"" no matter what! All the money we raise will be put to use. That is our promise. The more we get, the higher quality the production will be, which can only lead to bigger things; bigger is always better. Your money will make this series.  YOU WILL MAKE A WEB SERIES.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This series is about love. We are bringing a story that is based on true events to life for our viewers.

<h3>Why is THIS story so important for the world?</h3>
<p>Our world is still filled with people who don’t accept each other. Like we said, this show is grounded in love. It has heart.

<p>Our biggest challenge right now is having people take time off to shoot.  We have a 6 day shoot planned and for all of us in the arts, who have another job that typically puts a roof over our heads, taking those days off could mean we don’t make rent. It’s hard to get everyone involved to put this as their top priority. Despite this set back, we all are in this for love and because we know the potential that lies within this series. This story is what has brought us all together as a team, and as a team we will push forward.</p>
<p><br/>To solve these challenges, our team is honest and upfront with the needs for this series. We also hold respect and empathy at the forefront of our team values and this helps us prosper.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hello everyone!
Vasilios Filippakis and Anthony Filangeri  here. We are, respectively, a creator/actor and a writer, here in Toronto. You may recognize one of us from that Swiss Chalet commercial, loving that Chalet sauce (obviously Vasilios, always thirsty) and a handful of indie projects. You might have read some WWE Articles, written by our very own Mr. Filangeri. Yes…WWE is still big thing. Having been acting/writing in Toronto now for a few years we joined forces in the summer of ’16 to create the story, now called, ""FAK YAASS""! We have teamed with Matthew McLaughlin, the owner of Bulldog Productions, who is on board to bring this to lyffffeeee; but we need you.
Our campaign will raise the funding necessary to create the remaining 8 episodes of our 10 episodic web series (yes, that means EP 1 and EP 2 are complete) created by us and starring Vasilios and many other talented actors. Today is the time where actors and creators create their own work and make it happen! We find it liberating -creating your own work instead of sitting around, glued to your phone, waiting for that email from your agent (if you even have an agent…that’s a whole other story) to tell you you have an audition blarg blarg blarg…we think you get the point. 
How will all these amazing contributions help us? By reaching our goal we will be able to share this hilarious story that is grounded in love with all of you. We promise you will laugh, cry, get mad, shit yourself (this could actually happen, not our fault…)…really you’ll get all the feels. The potential this series has is outstanding. We already have interest from a major network production company to adapt the web series into a 30 minute network comedy! (It’s honestly so crazy and we're super thrilled) This web series is step one! All of you contributing play a huge role in the birth of ""FAK YAASS"" and will be there to watch it grow (you all can be proud parents). We could not do this without you! As we like to say, FAK. YAASSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS.
 

What We Need & What You Get
We need $25, 000. This budget was made so we can pay all of our cast, crew and post production team (editing, marketing, etc). This is the bare bones of what we need to make this project happen. Nobody is walking away from this and heading off to a all inclusive resort for vacation. We believe that if we all work as a team, give some time, you'll get a little $$$; it really helps! The budget includes locations, food, gear, props, makeup, transportation, and wardrobe, for a 6 day shoot PLUS marketing once we finish!
Our PerksIf you donate $100 or more, you are invited to our exclusive PRIDE KICKOFF PARTY on June 15th! This means you’ll be on a guest list, enjoy drinks and hors d'oeuvres, see some of Toronto's top performers and walk the red carpet with all the other amazing Canadian talent we have in attendance!
If you donate $500 you’ll get a coffee date with us, and some of the cast. YYAASSS. (as long as you live in the GTA)
If you donate $1000, we will bartend shirtless at your next event and you will get an executive producer credit.  Ummm, how cool is that!?
Check out the PERKS section after you read this and see all the ammmmazing perks offered.
 

If the goal isn't reached, what happens to the money?
We will make ""FAK YAASS"" no matter what! All the money we raise will be put to use. That is our promise. The more we get, the higher quality the production will be, which can only lead to bigger things; bigger is always better. Your money will make this series.  YOU WILL MAKE A WEB SERIES.
 
The Impact
This series is about love. We are bringing a story that is based on true events to life for our viewers. You will see the struggle it takes when you mix “modern” millennial views (being gay…yas queen) with old tradition values (gay=sick). We are hoping the impact of this series will initiate conversations and make us all learn from each other in a magnitude of ways. Our story is real, and relevant and will make you laugh, empathize and maybe see your world from a different perspective.
 

Why is THIS story so important for the world?

If we can help shift one person's mind about how they view anyone in the LGBTQ community; our job is done. Let's help start the conversation and make coming out a little bit easier.

<i>Dead Dog Returns</i> is a quirky sci-fi webseries for teenagers inspired by programmes like <i>Buffy</i>, <i>Stranger Things</i>, <i>Wolfblood</i> and <i>Scooby-Doo!</i>
</h3>
<p>It centres around a group of disparate college students who must team up with a recently bereaved local bobby to work together and restore order to their world when dead pets return to their owners.</p>
<p>The team is comprised of young passionate filmmakers who are working alongside professional film and theatre companies, Trett Films and The Keeper's Daughter.</p>
<p>The story is one of community cohesion at its heart - so it seems fitting that we're making our own creative opportunities in the local area, and are creating a high quality webseries that the whole community can be involved in!</p>

<h2>BEHIND THE SCENES: THE CASTING STRATEGY</h2>
<p>We wanted to cast the show the way the Millennials see the world, and for the most part, that is without color lines. The younger generation shuns the racism mentality that their parents (possibly) and grandparents (likely) had to some degree. In fact, one might go as far as to say they’re defiant of it. Instead, the Millennial generation just sees people as people. The melting  pot is the status quo for them. So, when we were thinking through the casting for the show, we were very cognizant of capturing that.</p>

<p>Family!  The lengths we would all go to make sure our family are safe and well, the mistakes parents sometimes make and how the decisions those parents make can have long lasting effects on their children for many years to come, all told from the perspective of a lonely 11 year old girl.</p>
<h3>Where did it come from?</h3>
<p>Day One was originally a short film script i wrote for my two children, after spending a little more time on it i realised the core idea had the potential to be a lot longer, from there it was adapted into a 6 part series of 10 minutes each, again I had idea after idea and just had to expand it.</p>
<p>I linked up and started collaborating with another writer David Edwards and bish bash bosh( 1 year later) we have 10 parts of 23minutes each, with a timeline that could enable us to write enough material to cover 3 series.</p>

<p>I envision this (and future episodes) further exploiting themes that examine our mutual fears, our darkest most base desires, and our most unspeakable of sins; to produce stories which might be conclusive to some, open-ended and dilemma-filled to others, and yet leave us all to involuntarily reflect upon our own lives; our questionable choices. To perhaps help us better see .. the light.</p>
<p>I encourage people to join not just this campaign, but the entire journey!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>The flip side to the budget being so low is there are very few risks involved, other than the personal 'risk' of creating something truly fantastic and releasing it into the world. Which I consider a privilege.</p>
<p>What I can absolutely guarantee is to be wholly committed, passionate and professional; to bring what I truly believe to be a great idea to full fruition.</p>

The Light Urban Chronicles series is a thrilling and dramaticly surprising continuation into that world and those themes! As well as the continual exploration of myself as a filmmaker.

With that said, I understand it's not just what I get, but what your good selves will also receive! And in that spirit I've some goodies to entice and impress, including an end of film thank you credit, digital copy of my short The Light, and - for those with deep pockets and/or BIG love for the project - an associate producer credit!

All smiles: some cast and crew pose for a quick pic on set of The Light.

Night moves: one of many late night shoots from my debut short The Light
 
Production is already underway!
Pre production has already begun on episode one, with the script and story-boards complete and locations diligently found, as well as returnees Terence Anderson (whose credits include Captain Philips)  back as Urban Man and Andrew Sowerby returning as Editor.
Only the casting of Anne, a few supporting roles, some crew positions and YOUR backing are outstanding before shooting commences in April!

story-boards complete: page one of The light: Urban chronicles#1

The Impact


I envision this (and future episodes) further exploiting themes that examine our mutual fears, our darkest most base desires, and our most unspeakable of sins; to produce stories which might be conclusive to some, open-ended and dilemma-filled to others, and yet leave us all to involuntarily reflect upon our own lives; our questionable choices. To perhaps help us better see .. the light.
I encourage people to join not just this campaign, but the entire journey!
 
Risks & Challenges

The flip side to the budget being so low is there are very few risks involved, other than the personal 'risk' of creating something truly fantastic and releasing it into the world. Which I consider a privilege.
What I can absolutely guarantee is to be wholly committed, passionate and professional; to bring what I truly believe to be a great idea to full fruition.

Sharing is Caring!

So please, at the very least, share this campaign (using the share-tools provided) with as many people as you possibly can; there’s always a chance they’ll feel the same as you. Remember: this is how revolutions start, people... with you!

<h2>Synopsis</h2>
<p>Sounds Good is a comedy series following an eclectic cast of characters at a struggling retail music store. Our protagonist, Jake, is a musician so lost in life that he’s resorted to sleeping on his free-spirited Grandmother’s couch. Most days is a balancing act between his off the wall best friend Boomer, who lives like it’s 1985, and Jake’s secret love interest and career-driven boss, Charleigh. Nothing comes easy at Sounds Good and maybe for that reason nothing gets done. But something has to change…right?</p>
<h2>What’s Different?</h2>
<p>Sounds Good is a strange world, period, and it’s characters find homes there for a reason. But despite all the silliness and at times the surreal nature of Sounds Good, there is a lot of heart. These are people shaped by their circumstances whether it’s poverty, homelessness, or a lack of direction in life, and no matter how lightly they handle their situations, some harsh realities cannot be denied.</p>
<h2>Behind the Story</h2>
<p>Unless you’ve worked in retail before, you’d probably be surprised at how many outlandish stories come from dead-end jobs. One night, while celebrating a friend’s birthday, our stories began to flow and Sounds Good -thank the birthday boy for the name- was born. Like many ideas that are forged in a party setting, nobody expected much of anything to come out of it. Yet, it was an idea none of us could let go of and one we were all weirdly qualified to handle.</p>

<p>Cast:</p>
<p>We are currently recasting a couple roles. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Madelyn Childress as Evelyn ""Evie"" Tobolsky.</strong> Evie is a 16-year-old Broadway and theater fanatic who lives for the stage and for performing. She dreams to be a professional singer just like her grandmother from whom Evie gets her affinity for 40s big band music/standards. Evie is one of the most warm-hearted, kind, caring, jovial, and giving people you'll ever meet; her ability to make people feel welcome and appreciated is astounding. Superpowers: Sonic scream; siren song (can bend a person's will to hers by singing).</li>
<li>
<strong>Keilah Wilson as Bryn Cooke.</strong> Bryn is 17, extremely socially and politically active (she is an aspiring journalist), and a military brat. After the loss of her mother Korinne, she and her father moved to Champaign to be closer to her grandmother. The loss, which shattered both their worlds, forged an even closer relationship with her father. She is one of Evie's best friends and is on the school newspaper staff with her. Superpower: Super intelligence; developing telekinesis. </li>
<li>
<strong>Jess Schlipf as Hayden Bennet.</strong> Hayden is 17, and has become a close confidant of Evie, and a good friend with the rest of the group. She's formed a bond with Tempest--Hayden was once the new kid just like Tempest--and has helped her adjust. On the surface, Hayden is friendly but after years of battling insecurities has developed defenses that can cause her personality to flip quickly. No super powers.</li>
<li>
<strong>McKenzie Deremiah as Tempest Grace.</strong>  Tempest is a 15-year-old dance student who has a love for ballet. She has only been studying for about 6 months or so, but has oddly picked everything up rapidly. Tempest identifies as Queer, and currently has a crush on a junior named Bree. While socially awkward and not entirely skilled at making friends, when she is able to she is incredibly loyal to them. Such is the case as the group of girls (Evie, Bryn, and Hayden) have welcomed them into the group. For most of her youth Tempest has searched for friends to help her break out of her shell, and finally, she's found said friends. She and Hayden have formed a close bond as they both battle through insecurities. Superpower: We'll just call it ""kinesthetics"" for now. She has a sort of super agility, is able to pick up and replicate physical movements (sports, dance, etc) extremely quickly, and can foresee a person's movements/attacks several steps ahead.</li>
<li>
<strong>Selima Samaha</strong>- TBA. </li>
<li>
<strong>Prince F. Robertson as Dr. Gregory ""Greg"" Cooke.</strong> Greg, 42 and Bryn's stern yet loving father, is a recently retired Colonel in the U.S. Army. After graduating from Westpoint, his exceptional intelligence helped him climb the military ranks quite rapidly until he reached Colonel by his mid-30s, in addition to obtaining a PhD while serving his country. As a military intelligence and Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) officer, Greg conducted biological/scientific research on the regenerative capabilities in animals and their potential human applications. Said research was pushed along after the manifestation of his own regenerative powers—these powers explain why Greg appears to look much younger than he actually is. By the time of his retirement, he had reached the rank of colonel and certainly had a much longer and illustrious career ahead of him. However, his decision to retire and move back home to teach at the University of Illinois was spurred on by two factors: 1) his fear of the military discovering his powers and using them immorally/for military medicine and weapons (these fears weren't completely off base as military intelligence began suspecting something and 2) the death of his wife Korinne—she was killed as a superpowered individual attempted to stop a robbery. Very much in love with her, her death shook Greg to the core and left him guilt- ridden for not being there to use his powers to protect her. Seeking comfort and now raising his now 16-year-old daughter Bryn alone, he retired, moved back home to be near his parents in Champaign, and accepted a position as a professor at the university. To this day he has kept his powers completely secret.</li>
<li>
<strong>James R. Ling as Alex Davenport.</strong>  Alex, 30, is a PhD candidate at the local university and works as a TA for Bryn Cooke's father Gregory. What Alex lacks in powers, he makes up for in intelligence and his ability to absorb new information quickly. Throughout his academic career, Alex has been obsessed with the regenerative nature of certain organisms. That obsession leads him to discover Gregory Cooke's research, which in turn became the catalyst for Alex's desire to work under Cooke.</li>
<li>
<strong>Brooke Sellers as Bree. </strong>Bree, 16, is a warm, caring, bubbly person who sees the best in people. Her mother is of Filipino decent (her father white), and she is learning to appreciate the culture of her ancestors. She has fallen in love with graphic design, and does most of the design for the high school's newspaper. Also Tempest's crush, the two of them build a close relationship in which Bree becomes the yang to Tempest's yin. Bree helps Tempest come out of her shell, and become more comfortable with herself.</li>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For this leg of the crowdfunding campaign, we are seeking a total of $4,000. Your donations to this campaign will cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pre-Production/Production/Post-Production Costs (Test shots, equipment rental, crew, reshoots/pick ups if necessary)</li>
<li>Catering/Crafts Table for Cast and Crew</li>
<li>Props/Practical Effects</li>
<li>Travel and Lodging for One or Two Cast Members</li>
<li>Fulfilling perks</li>
</ul>
<p>Any excess or leftover funds will be applied to branding such as posters, etc., and used to fund the full season. </p>
<p>Perks for contributing will range from a hearty thank you to digital and physical copies of both the pilot and the script to actual props from production to even invitations to set, screenings, and after parties. We even offer an opportunity to be an executive producer. </p>
<p>Funds, if we reach at least 80% of our goal but fall short, will still be applied to production costs as best we can. If we do not raise enough funds, production will not be possible and refunds will be offered. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>While our overall goal is to create an entertaining and well-produced pilot episode, our intentions are to bring a new perspective to the superhero genre. As superhero and comic book fans, we have grown frustrated with not only the lackluster representation of females, but also realistic female heroes when they are present. We have decided to remedy this issue by creating superheroes women, young and old alike, can relate to and support. No fawning over boys. No costumes that make them look like Jane Fonda in an exercise video. Real, down to earth, teenage girls that face everyday struggles and just happen to have powers. </li>
<li>In addition to the female representation, we seek to tackle issues that currently face the nation; issues/topics that we feel the nation needs to see and hear. </li>
<li>In the end, we hope to create a world of superheroes that ALL people can look up to and cheer on. </li>

<h3>
<br/><strong>Overview</strong>
</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>A man is riding his new bike down a jagged street in New Orleans as the fresh memories of his near death experience from Covid 19 spin with the wheels. A woman on a Swedish island is painting a bustling crowd on canvas, somehow feeling their companionship from her empty home.  A mother in South Africa is coming home from the market, taking her mask off as she greets her three children at the door. These stories are true. These stories are happening right as you read this. These people, like so many, have been torn apart by the global pandemic. They've been torn apart by fear. But, unlike most, they have been pieced back together in an epic tapestry of stories evoked from around the world.</p>
<p>This is their story. This is YOUR story. It's the story of circumventing the fear of Covid 19 that is holding humanity frozen and frenzied, and turning circumstances into opportunities. This is the story of people from around the world as they take part in a 40 day challenge to reach their personalized goals, leaving them better than before and finding a sense of community along the way.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>About</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>This is my story as well... as I’m the challenge creator who brought us all together for this 40 day experience. I’m Jess, a storyteller and filmmaker who went from a bustling life in the big city to, after a terrible turn of events, a life of solitude in a cabin deep in the wilderness. </p>
<p>At least it was solitude before people from around the world rose to the challenge and began sharing their experiences, their vulnerabilities, and a palpable sense of purpose and empowerment no border can contain. My life is now humbled. My days are fulfilled. My mission has become sharing these inspiring stories to as many people as possible so they, too, can experience the truth, perseverance, and sheer magnitude of the human spirit that blows my mind every day.</p>
<p>I want everyone to see it… starting with you. I want you to finally have some good news in this jarring world we inhabit. I want you to see what’s possible when we forget our differences long enough to remember we’re all the same. I want you to see people truly giving their goals their all despite the insanity of a worldwide pandemic… and find out what they are really made of. Come help us show the world an epic tapestry of meaningful stories that chronicle the global experience of this pandemic.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Cast</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>As we are still filming the challenge, the cast is subject to change. Here's a sample of the types of stories you'll embark on when watching the show. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Berkley</strong>-- New Orleans musician goes from a tough break to nearly broken after contracting and almost dying from Covid 19. </li>
<li>
<strong>Ghaireyah</strong>- South African muslim and single mother of 3 pushes through the quarantine while somehow still pursuing her passions of writing and comedy. </li>
<li>
<strong>Helen</strong>-- French CEO manages to maintain her integrity while swimming in the shark tank of business... only to experience a full burnout right as the quarantine began. </li>
<li>
<strong>Andrew/Missy</strong>-- Sailboat captain duo off the coast of California whose lives jolted to a halt as the wind left the sails of the tourism industry due to the pandemic. </li>
<li>
<strong>Brayan</strong>-- Go-getter and poet who road trips around the United States to find success. A conspiracy theorist at heart, he questions the answers with unique conclusions.</li>
<li>
<strong>Francisco</strong>-- Out of work hairdresser in Brazil and member of the gay community who navigates living situations to find security while maintaining his side job of designing exotic dancer costumes.</li>
<li>
<strong>Eva</strong>-- Swedish woman flees the city upon it's decision to take no action and let the virus run its course. She winds up in a cabin on an island where she is quarantined alone, despite being an extrovert at heart. </li>
<li>
<strong>Caitlin</strong>-- Out of work New York actor living in dangerous circumstances finds out she's pregnant unexpectedly... right at the beginning of the pandemic. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>... and there are many, many more stories to be shared.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>This 40 day challenge began with 40 participants from around the world who come from a wide range of locations, socioeconomic backgrounds and professions. This means we have quite the adventure in store as we piece together a show that involves multiple factors. So we are going to put in the work and resources to make this beautiful collage of stories mix together nicely by hiring top notch resources, helping this show become a full length docu-series comparable to what you might find on Netflix, The shooting of the show has been going since April and will be completed in June, so the majority of the expenses now lie in post production.</p>
<p>Here’s the breakdown for the industry standard post production costs in order to create an 8 episode show in 5 months with 230 hours of footage:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590074612/uq3rmwoy1lgebefkkkzd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li><i><strong>Editor (Including color, sound, graphics, exports) </strong></i></li>
<li><i><strong>Assistant Editor</strong></i></li>
<li><i><strong>Post Production Producer/Director (Including dailys, post supervision, coordination)</strong></i></li>
<li><i><strong>Executive Producer/Director (Including development to post storyline production)</strong></i></li>
<li><i><strong>Storyline Producer</strong></i></li>
<li><i><strong>Miscellaneous (Marketing design, trailer, music, tech equipment, debts, hard drives)</strong></i></li>
<li><i><strong>Contingency</strong></i></li>
<li><i><strong>Follow up film crews (Covering conclusion interviews, establishing shots, cinematic footage)</strong></i></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>= $230,000 Total</strong></i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>With this fundraiser, the more you give, the more you get! We have several levels of unique perks that are available to you. Some are classic, some are personalized and multicultural, and some include on screen involvement in our project that you’ll never forget!  Check out the prizes in the perks list on the right.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Just in case...</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>More good news is as this is an Indiegogo campaign, your contribution can help us even in the chance that we don’t hit our goal. Every donation will still be used for getting us the best editors, producers, marketing materials and overall completed show possible.  If we find we don’t have enough to complete the show from this campaign, all resources will go into marketing and sponsor hunting so we can get the money we need with a different strategy.</p>
<p>However, if we DO get picked up by a network who will handle paying for everything, all money raised by this campaign will directly go back to the communities of those involved to help them and their loved ones get through the pandemic.</p>
<p>Either way, we are doing whatever it takes to get this show completed and every penny you put into it helps make this or even directly helping those impacted most by Covid 19 possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>This show is different than most shows. Not only are we capturing the history of a global covid 19 phenomenon from many perspectives in many cultures, but we are making a difference towards a better world wide future in the process. This show humanizes the judged, humbles the extravagant, turns stereotypes on their heads, and digs deep into the pure truth of the human experience in a way modern media has lost the ability to. </p>
<p>We ask questions that challenge beliefs, show what can be possible despite the setbacks, and open an opportunity for the cast, production crew, and viewers to decide what our new post Covid 19 world could be. This show is more than a show. It’s a chance to take a break from the raucous of modern politics and news to experience rare authenticity and honesty that advances humanity a step closer to what it was meant to be.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Unpredictability</strong>: There are a few risks and challenges that come hand in hand with a project of this nature. First, the project itself is, while still structured, unpredictable in nature. We don’t know which participants will remain in the challenge, what they'll do or what circumstances may pop up as we are working with many strangers who are in unusual and often dangerous environments due to the pandemic. Fortunately, we are stemming from a production company that literally teaches workshops on improvising and adaptability corporately, so we are capable of adapting quickly to meet every need and have a top notch communicative team that helps each other if the ball gets dropped.</p>
<p>We also had a “test run” with a slightly shorter prototype challenge that is structured similarly and made for very identical circumstances, which occurred between March and April, 2020 at the start of the US quarantine. This test run resulted in us bringing on 40 participants to start the film as the expectation was that at least 20 would not make it through the challenge (we still have over 20 participants, however). </p> <p><strong>Drastic culture differences/locations</strong>: Another risk is having so many people on board who are from so many different cultural backgrounds.

A man is riding his new bike down a jagged street in New Orleans as the fresh memories of his near death experience from Covid 19 spin with the wheels. A woman on a Swedish island is painting a bustling crowd on canvas, somehow feeling their companionship from her empty home.  A mother in South Africa is coming home from the market, taking her mask off as she greets her three children at the door. These stories are true. These stories are happening right as you read this. These people, like so many, have been torn apart by the global pandemic. They've been torn apart by fear. But, unlike most, they have been pieced back together in an epic tapestry of stories evoked from around the world.
This is their story. This is YOUR story. It's the story of circumventing the fear of Covid 19 that is holding humanity frozen and frenzied, and turning circumstances into opportunities. This is the story of people from around the world as they take part in a 40 day challenge to reach their personalized goals, leaving them better than before and finding a sense of community along the way.
 
About
 
This is my story as well... as I’m the challenge creator who brought us all together for this 40 day experience. I’m Jess, a storyteller and filmmaker who went from a bustling life in the big city to, after a terrible turn of events, a life of solitude in a cabin deep in the wilderness. 
At least it was solitude before people from around the world rose to the challenge and began sharing their experiences, their vulnerabilities, and a palpable sense of purpose and empowerment no border can contain. My life is now humbled. My days are fulfilled. My mission has become sharing these inspiring stories to as many people as possible so they, too, can experience the truth, perseverance, and sheer magnitude of the human spirit that blows my mind every day.
I want everyone to see it… starting with you. I want you to finally have some good news in this jarring world we inhabit. I want you to see what’s possible when we forget our differences long enough to remember we’re all the same. I want you to see people truly giving their goals their all despite the insanity of a worldwide pandemic… and find out what they are really made of. Come help us show the world an epic tapestry of meaningful stories that chronicle the global experience of this pandemic.
 
Cast
 
As we are still filming the challenge, the cast is subject to change. Here's a sample of the types of stories you'll embark on when watching the show. 


Berkley-- New Orleans musician goes from a tough break to nearly broken after contracting and almost dying from Covid 19. 

Ghaireyah- South African muslim and single mother of 3 pushes through the quarantine while somehow still pursuing her passions of writing and comedy. 

Helen-- French CEO manages to maintain her integrity while swimming in the shark tank of business... only to experience a full burnout right as the quarantine began. 

Andrew/Missy-- Sailboat captain duo off the coast of California whose lives jolted to a halt as the wind left the sails of the tourism industry due to the pandemic. 

Brayan-- Go-getter and poet who road trips around the United States to find success. A conspiracy theorist at heart, he questions the answers with unique conclusions.

Francisco-- Out of work hairdresser in Brazil and member of the gay community who navigates living situations to find security while maintaining his side job of designing exotic dancer costumes.

Eva-- Swedish woman flees the city upon it's decision to take no action and let the virus run its course. She winds up in a cabin on an island where she is quarantined alone, despite being an extrovert at heart. 

Caitlin-- Out of work New York actor living in dangerous circumstances finds out she's pregnant unexpectedly... right at the beginning of the pandemic. 

 
... and there are many, many more stories to be shared.
 
What We Need & What You Get
 
This 40 day challenge began with 40 participants from around the world who come from a wide range of locations, socioeconomic backgrounds and professions. This means we have quite the adventure in store as we piece together a show that involves multiple factors. So we are going to put in the work and resources to make this beautiful collage of stories mix together nicely by hiring top notch resources, helping this show become a full length docu-series comparable to what you might find on Netflix, The shooting of the show has been going since April and will be completed in June, so the majority of the expenses now lie in post production.
Here’s the breakdown for the industry standard post production costs in order to create an 8 episode show in 5 months with 230 hours of footage:


Editor (Including color, sound, graphics, exports) 
Assistant Editor
Post Production Producer/Director (Including dailys, post supervision, coordination)
Executive Producer/Director (Including development to post storyline production)
Storyline Producer
Miscellaneous (Marketing design, trailer, music, tech equipment, debts, hard drives)
Contingency
Follow up film crews (Covering conclusion interviews, establishing shots, cinematic footage)

 
= $230,000 Total
 
With this fundraiser, the more you give, the more you get! We have several levels of unique perks that are available to you. Some are classic, some are personalized and multicultural, and some include on screen involvement in our project that you’ll never forget!  Check out the prizes in the perks list on the right.
 
Just in case...
 
More good news is as this is an Indiegogo campaign, your contribution can help us even in the chance that we don’t hit our goal. Every donation will still be used for getting us the best editors, producers, marketing materials and overall completed show possible.  If we find we don’t have enough to complete the show from this campaign, all resources will go into marketing and sponsor hunting so we can get the money we need with a different strategy.
However, if we DO get picked up by a network who will handle paying for everything, all money raised by this campaign will directly go back to the communities of those involved to help them and their loved ones get through the pandemic.
Either way, we are doing whatever it takes to get this show completed and every penny you put into it helps make this or even directly helping those impacted most by Covid 19 possible.
 
The Impact
 
This show is different than most shows. Not only are we capturing the history of a global covid 19 phenomenon from many perspectives in many cultures, but we are making a difference towards a better world wide future in the process. This show humanizes the judged, humbles the extravagant, turns stereotypes on their heads, and digs deep into the pure truth of the human experience in a way modern media has lost the ability to. 
We ask questions that challenge beliefs, show what can be possible despite the setbacks, and open an opportunity for the cast, production crew, and viewers to decide what our new post Covid 19 world could be. This show is more than a show. It’s a chance to take a break from the raucous of modern politics and news to experience rare authenticity and honesty that advances humanity a step closer to what it was meant to be.

After graduating with a bachelors in Intercultural Communication and Anthropology at the University of New Mexico, I began my award winning production company, Rumble Productions, in 2014.
My other experiences include a long history in motivational challenge development, which began in 2012 when I graduated from a rigorous leadership program and began creating my own workshops and challenges. I have also professionally worked in film both behind and in front of the camera since 2012, where I crewed such films and shows as Jane Got a Gun with Natalie Portman, Corporate Animals with Ed Helms, Cliffs of freedom by Van Ling, Better Call Saul, and most recently, the Mother Mary pilot with Rachel Bloom.

However, he jumps at the chance to see the world. Having filmed From Los Angeles to Berlin, Carlos is always looking for an adventure. 
What Carlos brings to this project is the ability to see objectively while bearing in mind a final product. Film experience has not changed his viewpoint that every story is what you take away from it as a viewer. In addition to having been in production, Carlos was an actor in the Screen actors Guild. The ability to see the process from both sides lends an understanding to members on both sides of the camera.

Risks and Challenges
 
Unpredictability: There are a few risks and challenges that come hand in hand with a project of this nature. First, the project itself is, while still structured, unpredictable in nature. We don’t know which participants will remain in the challenge, what they'll do or what circumstances may pop up as we are working with many strangers who are in unusual and often dangerous environments due to the pandemic. Fortunately, we are stemming from a production company that literally teaches workshops on improvising and adaptability corporately, so we are capable of adapting quickly to meet every need and have a top notch communicative team that helps each other if the ball gets dropped.
We also had a “test run” with a slightly shorter prototype challenge that is structured similarly and made for very identical circumstances, which occurred between March and April, 2020 at the start of the US quarantine. This test run resulted in us bringing on 40 participants to start the film as the expectation was that at least 20 would not make it through the challenge (we still have over 20 participants, however).  Drastic culture differences/locations: Another risk is having so many people on board who are from so many different cultural backgrounds. Language, personalities, cultural needs, time zones, levels of danger in their living situation, and overall risk varies from person to person. So, keeping a group such as this uniform, up to date with the prompts and side challenges, on board with technology, out of harms way to the best of our ability, and with the spotlight of attention they each deserve is a challenge.
To counter this risk, we brought on four experienced, patient and supportive producers who each oversee 25% of the participants and communicate amongst each other in order to ensure the highest quality experience for everyone involved. We have been arranging translations, meeting everyone where they were at with technology, adapting to various needs, and keeping an eye on the progress and depth of each storyline and experience involved. No participant has been left behind save for those who opted out. No producer is left behind, either, as we care for the production teams needs just as fervently as we are all handling the same pandemic.  Post production necessities: One thing that could be problematic is we have dozens of different stories interwoven with dozens of different cameras, mics, lighting set ups and technologies involved. This requires extra care during editing with extra color and sound mixing, potentially extra pick up and redo shots, and even more interviews after the original challenge to make sure there are no holes in the storylines. Making this look and sound great while making sure it all makes sense will be a hefty but worthy experience in order for this show to succeed. So we need funding at the industry standard level. 
To counter this risk, we are taking four completely different fundraising approaches. One is we are having the indiegogo for the full price and informing the media in many involved cities to get enough recognition to hit our donation goal. We are also preparing a top notch pitch package to approach already funded networks, approaching celebrities to get their involvement so we have more safety nets in place, investigating available grants or non profits who value the motivational, cultural and motivational worlds. Other Ways You Can Help

<p><strong>After a run in</strong> with a voodoo priestess as a child, Marcus Downer is convinced he is cursed with bad luck. Developing a series of spell breaking rituals and totems since his 9th birthday, Marcus has become accustomed to a life of mishaps well into adulthood. As a fresh start, the aspiring screenwriter leaves Chicago for California to pursue a career in film and television. Life in Los Angeles, however, is not turning out as Marcus had imagined. On his 29th birthday, after performing his usual mock voodoo ritual, he hits a wall of misfortune that forces him to confront his past, take control of his life and rid of this curse for good.</p>

<p><br/><strong>We, the creator and producer</strong> of <i>JU-ju</i>, a comedy about a young man overcoming seemingly insurmountable obstacles to pursue his dreams, need your help in bringing this story to the screen.</p>
<p>We're looking to raise money to produce a show that will make you all laugh and feel a part of our journey throughout Season 1. With our teaser above, 8 written scripts and your help, we believe we can bring this hilarious story to life! </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Join us</strong> by helping to fund this hilarious project. We've got the promotional trailer and eight side splittingly funny scripts ALREADY WRITTEN. We need your help getting this story filmed and distributed to the world. We're asking you all to help us make our $60,000 goal. Here's the intel on where your money will go:</p>
<ul>
<li>The $60,000 we raise here will go toward our small but awesome independent film crew - actors, producers, cinematographers, sound mixers and set designers - who have mastered the ability to be nimble and cost effective without sacrificing quality.</li>
<li>The money will also cover production costs like: legal services, locations, wardrobe, make-up, equipment rentals, marketing, distribution and festival submissions.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In return</strong>, we've got some dope perks for you! Check out the list to the right that offers everything from a special thank you to attending the LA Premiere with us!</p>
<p><strong>Don't you fret</strong>, if you're able to support financially or not, word of mouth is as good as gold. Know that every time you spread the word we make this show more and more possible. </p>

<p><br/><strong>Mysticism is a part</strong> of the African American narrative. The last time we can remember seeing brown faces and the concept of <i>JU-ju</i> was in Eve's Bayou, a favorite film of our producer's. The creator of <i>JU-ju</i> comes from a lineage that migrated from the Gulf of Mexico to Chicago and with his familial heritage and extensive research, we've been able to put together an authentic depiction of a serious spiritual practice in a hilarious way. </p>
<p><strong>If you haven't noticed</strong>, the show logo for <i>JU-ju</i> is very 90s. In fact, it's absolutely inspired by the hit 90s sitcom, <i>Martin</i>. One of our aims is to give you a modern version of the boldness of that era: colors, shapes, lighting style and even some new takes on classic scenes.</p>
<p><strong>The creator of <i>JU-ju</i></strong> grew up completely enamored with sketch comedy of the 90s, from <i>In</i> <i>Living Color</i> to <i>Mad TV</i>. In <i>JU-ju</i> he brings these larger than life, ridiculous characters that color the show throughout each encounter and he fully commits as the protagonist of the story in what, at times, is very physical comedy. Some of the best parts of filming were completely improvised as our creator pulled from his network of performers from The Second City where he performed weekly for a time. While the script was the guide, as director, he allowed them to bring their improv sensibilities to their characters and play with lines in a way that would really take the comedy over the edge.</p>

<p><strong>As with most things in life</strong>, there are risks and challenges. In the case of <i>JU-ju</i>, the only risk is putting ourselves out in the world creatively for others to judge and critique. Any other risks are in our minds. Of course, there's the anxiety of whether or not we'll make our goal but, the way we see it? There's more anxiety in never trying a thing at all. </p>
<p>One of the challenges that come with crowdfunding and creating this show is maintaining clarity of vision. In the writer's room, we are pulling together people from different backgrounds and experiences to tell a story that is uniquely African American AND universal at the same time. In that process, we have to maintain the reality of who our crazy characters are within a world that still feels real to the viewer. Now, we know this doesn't sound much like a challenge, but everyone has a different writing style and interesting realities that we have to corral and make sure are in line with  message behind <i>this </i>kind of story. A story that is supernatural without being superhero.</p>
<p>We're also challenged by the misconceptions people have about African American stories and whether they are relatable to non-African Americans.  To that, we say, to be human is universal. To chase something you want badly is universal. To fail repeatedly at something is universal for all who try something bigger then themselves. To get out of your own head is a universal practice. Comedy is universal. LAUGHTER is universal.</p>
<p>*steps off Iyanla soapbox*</p>
<p>Basically, everyone will see themselves in this story but yes, it's important that African Americans recognize the small things that we've inserted as well. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Working Title was first created by Eva Luna and Noah Bruckshen in August of 2016. It began as nothing more than a joke - the idea of a TV show about a boring, generic workplace, where one of the characters is a vampire and it's never really addressed. As conversations continued and the characters began to take form though, we realized that it had become much more than that. This was a full, well rounded story about people we had grown to really care about - and not only that, a story that it was important to us to tell.</p>
<p>It's impossible for us to tell it alone though.</p>
<p>UPDATE: The pilot is now available online <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7lOe9iBC_ZY&amp;t=5s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to make what we want to make, at the quality we feel it needs, it'll take us around $2,000 per episode. This comes out to $10,000 to make the rest of our first half a season, which is 5 more episodes. We realize this is a lot to ask for, which is why we've broken it down by episode. </p>
<ul>
<li>$2,000 - Episode 2: Like Oprah Always Says...</li>
<li>$4,000 - Episode 3: Sexual Harassment, if you Know What I Mean</li>
<li>$6,000 - Episode 4: Like a House Fire</li>
<li>$8,000 - Episode 5: Ghosts?</li>
<li>$10,000 - Episode 6: Sunday in the Park with Janine</li>
</ul>
<p>This is our rough budget in order to afford props, costumes, camera/sound/lighting equipment, and the ability to make this a viable, sustainable project for our cast and crew. However much is raised through this campaign will determine how many episodes we are able to shoot.</p>

</h3><p>I’m Gabe Alvarado. I created a non-profit foundation specifically to help prevent teen suicide. I am working with a team of world-renown animation storytellers and a team of suicide experts to create a powerful animated series called <i>My Life is Worth Living</i>. </p><p>I approached the Wonder Media animation studio because they write powerful animated stories that affect change. <i>My Life is Worth Living</i> will be available FREE of charge 24 hours a day on YouTube and social media, where teenagers spend 85% of their time.</p><p>Suicide is the second leading cause of death for young people ages 13-17. In the last decade, hospital admissions for suicide attempts have <strong>doubled.</strong> I believe it is imperative to take action now! </p><p>Our goal is to <strong>give at-risk teenagers hope</strong> by modeling what hope looks like, with characters and stories that ring true and are relatable. When a desperate teenager is sitting alone in a dark place our stories are intended to lead them out of the darkness and into the light.</p><p>This online initiative will provide a global platform capable of connecting and engaging teenagers in the conversation about suicide prevention while teaching important prevention skills. This will include skills like recognizing warning signs associated with suicidal behavior and how to reach out when you’re having suicidal thoughts.</p><p>We will launch the first iteration of this initiative nationwide on Suicide Prevention Day on September 10, 2020.</p><div>

<h3>Gabe Alvarado's Story</h3>
<div>
<p>Life can change in a flash. That moment for me was when I was injured in an explosion at the oil refinery where I worked. I lost my left arm and suffered burns on over 60% of my body both inside and out. The pain was so excruciating that I was in an induced coma for 90 days. After coming out of the coma, I was put on suicide watch due to the effects of trauma on my mind and body. But, when I started to recover I didn’t want to die. I realized that my life is worth living. It was at that moment that I came to realize my life’s purpose. I am here to give hope to anyone who might be considering suicide due to the effects of physical or emotional trauma. </p>
<p>My story of hope after pain was used as the inspiration for the animated character in our series named Danny. He is a teenager who suffered severe burns saving his brother, Angel, from a house fire. Danny will be one of the many characters in the animated series we create to provide a guiding light for teenagers.  Angel will be one of the characters who demonstrates the ways to support loved ones who are experiencing suicidal thoughts.</p>
<div>By connecting with teens through animated characters and stories, we can empower them with lifelong skills to help themselves and others through dark times. We want to be a part of the solution! By speaking frankly and empathetically about suicide, we can give at-risk teens and the people in their lives the tools to recognize suicidal behavior.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My life was saved. I want to pay it back and use intentional animated stories to <strong>save the lives of others! </strong>

The series was produced for the Barbara Sinatra Children’s Center and has been viewed by over 200 million people and adopted by the United Nations, the National YMCA and the Boy Scouts of America.</li>
<li>
<strong>The experience of my team </strong>— The founder of Wonder Media, Terry Thoren, has over 40 years of animation producing experience. He was the former CEO of Klasky Csupo, Inc. the studio that incubated the <i>Simpsons</i> and produced<i> Rugrats</i>, <i>The Wild Thornberrys </i>and <i>Rocket Power</i>.</li>

<h3>My Plan</h3>
<p><strong>I need your help.</strong> No one can do it alone. In order to produce quality animation, I must work with expert producers, creative directors, voice talent, and writers. </p>
<p>I will consider one life saved, and one family spared the pain of losing a loved one, a rich return on our investment.</p>
<p><strong>It will be worth it.</strong></p>
<p>Animated episodes on YouTube have the potential to <strong>reach millions of people!</strong><strong> The Wonder Media team has produced content that has connected with billions of people worldwide. </strong>They know how to equip this generation with the tools to help them climb out of a dark place.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Wonder Media has also produced <i>The Protect Yourself Rules </i>and<i> Stop the Secrets That Hurt</i> with the Barbara Sinatra Children’s Center Foundation to fight child abuse. Those videos have been viewed by over 200 million people worldwide and The Boys Scouts of America now require every Cub Scout to view the series!</p>
<p><i>The Protect Yourself Rules </i>and <i>Stop the Secrets That Hurt </i>videos have inspired children to talk about their abuse. You can scroll to the bottom of this campaign for examples of the comments and letters children have sent after viewing the videos on YouTube and how they were influenced by the stories they saw. We hope to have the same level of impact on teenagers experiencing thoughts of suicide.</p>
<p>Wonder Media is passionate about helping children in all stages of life. They also produced a series of animations for the Global Institute for Habits of Mind to teach children critical thinking skills like “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBPchn0hvsI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">managing impulsivity</a>,” “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiIqWcWITbM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">thinking about your thinking</a>,” and how to “<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFmE3cueJcc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">listen with understanding and empathy</a>.”  </p>

<h3>What We Need and What You Can Get</h3>
<p>Every dollar donated to our cause humbles and amazes me. We have designed exciting packages for people who become a part of our team. Our favorite package is the Lifeline Package for $198. With the Lifeline Package, you will receive frame-able custom artwork, credits in an episode, a tote bag, a t-shirt, and <strong>early access to the episode animatics! </strong>Animatics are the preliminary version of an episode, using storyboards and soundtrack to visualize the story.</p>
<p>For larger donations—such as the Benefactor Package—you can be <strong>made into an animated character</strong> in <i>My Life is Worth Living</i>! However, we know that large donations aren’t feasible for every person and<strong> we truly and deeply appreciate each dollar</strong> that comes in for our mission — we thank you on behalf of teenagers whose lives we have the power to affect.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578531398/mx8we5bik1stgwdskopo.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>What does an animated series cost? ……... What does it cost to build a house?</h3>
<p>When people ask “What does an animated series cost?”, we think of it this way: “What does it cost to build a house?” The cost to build a house is dictated by the size of the house, the number of rooms, the size of the land, etc. The same is true of animation. The bigger the series, the more it costs to build.</p>
<p>Animation can be expensive. For example, Frozen II cost $1 million per minute of animation. But our goal is to keep production costs under $9500 per minute.</p>
<p>We plan to raise $50,000 to be used to develop new animated characters for the series, develop the world they live in, and then produce the first two episodes of <i>My Life is Worth Living</i>. We will then share these new episodes with global organizations who have the power to help us find the funding to produce a library of episodes.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Production Plan</h3>
<p>Your contribution will help take the series from the development stage all the way to the finished episodes. You can help us build this house! Here’s what the production process will look like:</p>
<p><strong>Development:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We will create a library of characters</li>
<li>We will develop the world they live in while keeping social and cultural considerations in mind based on the statistics of teen suicide</li>
<li>We will create a series bible that will be reviewed by our suicide prevention experts to ensure that they align with best practices</li>
<li>We will write a treatment and script for each episode</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Pre-Production:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>2D artists will create designs for each character</li>
<li>Storyboard artists will create storyboards as a scene by scene road-map for each episode</li>
<li>We will collaborate with a casting director to cast the right voice talent</li>
<li>Editors will combine storyboards with voice over to create an animatic for each episode</li>
<li>We will do test screenings with teenagers and prevention experts </li>
<li>We will use feedback from our test screenings to make improvements in order to create the best episodes possible</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Production:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Animators will create animation libraries for each character</li>
<li>2D artists will design and create props for each character</li>
<li>2D artists will design and create backgrounds for each scene</li>
<li>Animators will animate each character in each scene</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Post-Production:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Editors will composite the animation with the backgrounds and props</li>
<li>Editors will create any visual effects needed to help tell each story</li>
<li>A composer will score and sound design the episode to enhance the world</li>
<li>Editors will combine the soundtrack with the scenes to complete the episodes</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Stretch Goal</h3>
<p>If the campaign reaches the goal and receives additional donations, that money will be used to produce additional episodes.

</div></div>","Help Prevent Teen Suicide by Supporting My Life is Worth Living
I’m Gabe Alvarado. I created a non-profit foundation specifically to help prevent teen suicide. I am working with a team of world-renown animation storytellers and a team of suicide experts to create a powerful animated series called My Life is Worth Living. I approached the Wonder Media animation studio because they write powerful animated stories that affect change. My Life is Worth Living will be available FREE of charge 24 hours a day on YouTube and social media, where teenagers spend 85% of their time.Suicide is the second leading cause of death for young people ages 13-17. In the last decade, hospital admissions for suicide attempts have doubled. I believe it is imperative to take action now! Our goal is to give at-risk teenagers hope by modeling what hope looks like, with characters and stories that ring true and are relatable. When a desperate teenager is sitting alone in a dark place our stories are intended to lead them out of the darkness and into the light.This online initiative will provide a global platform capable of connecting and engaging teenagers in the conversation about suicide prevention while teaching important prevention skills. This will include skills like recognizing warning signs associated with suicidal behavior and how to reach out when you’re having suicidal thoughts.We will launch the first iteration of this initiative nationwide on Suicide Prevention Day on September 10, 2020.
The Gabe Alvarado Foundation is a 501(c)(3) is an IRS-designated 501c3 non-profit. Tax ID #83-3831012.  All donations are wholly tax-deductible.
 

 

 
Gabe Alvarado's Story

Life can change in a flash. That moment for me was when I was injured in an explosion at the oil refinery where I worked. I lost my left arm and suffered burns on over 60% of my body both inside and out. The pain was so excruciating that I was in an induced coma for 90 days. After coming out of the coma, I was put on suicide watch due to the effects of trauma on my mind and body. But, when I started to recover I didn’t want to die. I realized that my life is worth living. It was at that moment that I came to realize my life’s purpose. I am here to give hope to anyone who might be considering suicide due to the effects of physical or emotional trauma. 
My story of hope after pain was used as the inspiration for the animated character in our series named Danny. He is a teenager who suffered severe burns saving his brother, Angel, from a house fire. Danny will be one of the many characters in the animated series we create to provide a guiding light for teenagers.  Angel will be one of the characters who demonstrates the ways to support loved ones who are experiencing suicidal thoughts.
By connecting with teens through animated characters and stories, we can empower them with lifelong skills to help themselves and others through dark times. We want to be a part of the solution! By speaking frankly and empathetically about suicide, we can give at-risk teens and the people in their lives the tools to recognize suicidal behavior.
 
My life was saved. I want to pay it back and use intentional animated stories to save the lives of others! 

 

This video explains why I want to use animation.

 
7 Reasons why My Life is Worth Living WILL help prevent teen suicide:


Power of animation — Animation is a universal language that connects powerfully to young people. Teens are more likely to listen to and take advice from animated characters in relatable stories than from an adult giving them the same information.

Use of social media — Teens today are more connected than ever, spending about 85% of their free time, or 60 hours per week, in front of a device. The animated series will meet them where they are on YouTube and social media.

Free and available everywhere — The series will be made available online for FREE. This will allow us to reach teens in the moment they are struggling without any barriers to accessibility.

Wonder Media successes — My partner, Wonder Media, has experienced huge success with an animated series to prevent child abuse called the Protect Yourself Rules. The series was produced for the Barbara Sinatra Children’s Center and has been viewed by over 200 million people and adopted by the United Nations, the National YMCA and the Boy Scouts of America.

The experience of my team — The founder of Wonder Media, Terry Thoren, has over 40 years of animation producing experience. He was the former CEO of Klasky Csupo, Inc. the studio that incubated the Simpsons and produced Rugrats, The Wild Thornberrys and Rocket Power.

Reviewed by experts — The series will be reviewed by doctors and teen suicide experts to ensure that the animated stories model the best practices in suicide prevention and that the strategies are research-based.

My passion — My experience with physical and mental trauma has given me a passion to connect with teenagers to help prevent teen suicide.

In 2011 Caesar decided that New Orleans comedy needed a voice so he founded Piss Yo Pants Comedy LLC. Also that same  year Mark started his weekly comedy series ""Laugh And Sip"" where many of the nations best comedians from the south stopped by to hone their skills where at  any given time Caesar could yell out ""Don't trip!"" And the capacity crowd would respond ""Laugh And Sip"". In 2015 Mark embarked on his national ""This Ain't No Open Mic Comedy Tour"" where he witnessed sold out shows in New York, Atlanta, New Orleans, Toronto, Washington, D.C., and Oakland amongst other cites. Also in 2015 Caesar headlined 97 Comedy shows gaining the rep as a tour monster!

<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>THE FEMALE GAZE, is made by a team of female filmmakers and alumni from Emerson College. Shefali Vasudevan, the creator, wanted to create a show that explored the stories of her friends and life in Los Angeles--with a specific emphasis on telling these stories through the female perspective.</p>
<p>This campaign would raise funds for the costs of production, post-production, and marketing, that were originally self-funded in the first season. This includes camera costs, equipment rental, food, and much more listed below in more detail and in the above video.</p>

<p>Hi, I'm Caleb Smiley</p>
<p>I'm an award winning filmmaker and  I'm passionate about telling powerful stories that involve great characters.</p>
<p>This campaign is to help jump start  my passion project. Ever since High School I have had the idea to tell a story about my experience in church Youth Group. I have learned a lot from my positive and negative experiences and I want to share them in a fun and  entertaining way.</p>
<p>Funding this campaign will get this project off the ground and prove the merit of this project to potential investors. The goal is to make a short trailer showing powerful highlights from the first couple episodes so we can show the style feel and humor of the show.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The funds from this campaign will allow us to deliver a professional level of quality to the production. The money will be used to pay professional crew members like the director of Photography and Audio/sound engineer. It will also help cover the cost of equipment needed for the shoot.  Any extra money will go back  into the project and will allow us to more easily move forward by being able to purchase things like a solid editing computer and other essential gear.</p>
<p>For those that donate, we offer multiple levels of personal updates and communication about the project. We will keep you updated with emails and possibly schedule some q&amp;a live streams so we can talk about our next steps.</p>
<p>If we don't end up reaching our goal, we will still try to make the trailer video but won't be able to do so with the ideal amount of resources.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you are a christian, you know and feel the need for family friendly content that is devoid of political agendas. Unfortunately there are very few alternatives that are also well made and entertaining with solid storytelling. This show will be one that all people can enjoy. There will be no heavy handed christian theology but the story will be echoing God and biblical ideals all throughout. We want to make something that Christians and non-Christians alike can enjoy. We want to make people laugh but will also tackle some very heavy issues and show what happens when you make the right and wrong choices. We strongly believe this show has the capacity to change lives.</p>
<p>Getting the show off the ground will have major challenges. Our first season will require a couple million to produce but I have little doubt it can be done. This has always been a strong calling for me and I believe that if it is God's will for this show to be made then there is nothing that will stand in our way. I won't lie to you and tell you this isn't a crazy idea for someone like me to make this happen, I have never made a TV show before or any Hollywood level production at all but I see our situation as no different than David or Moses or Saul or Peter or Joseph or Gideon or any of the many characters in scripture that were the lowest of the low. The thing is that God's power is made perfect in weakness and if this show is meant to happen then it's God's power that will make it happen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We need help in so many ways and there's more that we need besides money.  If you want to support what we are doing here please pray for us and for God's will to be done for this project.

<p>In this test scene, Kenolta Lyef, a street-talking, potbellied, alcoholic knight on the animal-populated planet of Planimus, has been arrested for the assassination of President Kaprakoza, a goat. He is accused of rigging the planet’s Globe of Peace and rolling it over the chief executive, flattening him. His monogrammed flask is discovered at the scene of the crime. The police detain Kenolta and try to get a confession out of him by any means necessary.</p>
<p>This scene is from <i>Space Rabbit </i>- a puppet sci-fi TV show directed by filmmaker and critic Matt Zoller Seitz. It's an adventure about a group of puppet animals trying to free their planet from a dictator. In production now. Release in 2018.</p>

<p><i><strong>Matt and Kenolta</strong></i></p>
<p>My name is Matt Zoller Seitz. I've been a film and TV critic and independent filmmaker for 20 years, but my whole life, I secretly wanted to be Jim Henson. My two children were raised in a version of the world I'd like to inhabit, one filled with eccentric stuffed animal and puppet characters that have psychologies as complex as any human's. The star of this world was Eta P. Squirrel, a rodent born in Kentucky who remade herself as a wisecracking New York dame. Supporting characters included Dusty Rabbit, who was dumb as a carrot but loyal to his friends; Senor Kitty, a dashing Chilean alley cat who dressed like Cary Grant and prized dignity above all else; and Margareta von Colada, a Siamese cat whose acting ability would dazzle Meryl Streep. These performers and more will appear in <i>Space Rabbit. </i></p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/204632358?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p>SPACE RABBIT is the first film project for this group of tiny but passionate puppet actors: an epic tale of conspiracy, in which a band of unlikely heroes tries to prevent their humble republic from falling into a dictator's paws. Some scenes will be shot on miniature sets, which will then be used as rear-screen projected backdrops for the puppets.  Other scenes will be shot on full size, hand puppet-scale sets, half the size of human soundstages.  But the style will always be gloriously cinematic, treating these handmade settings and characters as if they were existing worlds shot by the crew of an epic that expected to sweep the Oscars. The story includes a number of elaborate action scenes, constructed for maximum suspense even though they might end with, say, a duck dropping a toy piano on an elephant's head.</p>

<h3>What do we need to make SPACE RABBIT?</h3>
<p>We are raising money to make the pilot episode of season 1 of <i>Space Rabbit</i>.  This project started off as a feature length film, then we realized that there are so many amazing characters and scenes that the story is best told as at least an 8 episode television show.  We hope to create a mesmerizing pilot episode and then convince a TV distributor or network to fund the rest of the season.  If that plan doesn't come to fruition, we may either finish season 1 on our own using means available to us and then try to self distribute it, perhaps through internet Video on Demand, DVD, Blu Ray; or we may integrate what we've shot into a self-contained feature film, then send the film to festivals, seek distribution, or self-distribute.</p>
<p>SPACE RABBIT needs your donations to bring this story to life, put it on screens of all kinds and sizes, and most importantly, to entertain.</p>
<p>We need funds to design and build original puppet characters—in some cases whole armies of characters—and construct the world they inhabit: everything from a jazz club, a swanky bachelor pad, and a decadent throne room to animal- and food-shaped hovercrafts, dense city skylines, and spectacular landscapes. These will have to be built from wood, paper, plastic,  discarded appliances and office supplies, and perhaps furniture we rescued from city dumps and our parents' garages (everything is raw material as far as we're concerned). And of course we will need to pay for professional puppeteers, voice actors, camera and lighting equipment, and food for the cast and crew during the summer 2017 filming period.</p>
<p>Part of the money raised will be set aside to promote and distribute <i>Space Rabbit </i>and get it out in front of people who will love it - especially if  we end up having to self-distribute the project. If we end up self-distributing on internet VOD, we will use the distribution funds to create an effective marketing campaign, and creating home video versions of the project; high quality DVDs and Blu-Rays.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488338840/bn9lcmien5g1y02lrpjb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i><strong>Daniel Guillaro filming the test scene</strong></i></p>
<p>If the project's ultimate form ends up being a movie, we might need to create a high-quality version of <i>Space Rabbit</i> that can be screened at film festivals, then pay for the festival admission fees and travel expenses. We would also need to pay for online and other marketing, DVDs and Blu-rays, and theatrical screenings for critics and distributors.</p>
<p>We will work towards getting the best deals possible on work space rental, storage, puppets, sets, voice actors, film equipment and crew, editing, sound recording and music. </p>
<p>Once the project is done, we will tell donors how the money was spent.</p>

<h2><strong>What do you get if you donate to SPACE RABBIT? </strong></h2>
<p><i>NOTE: When a perk says ""movie"" re: Space Rabbit, we mean the show/TV show.  Earlier descriptions of project got locked in once donors claimed a given perk, cannot be edited after that point.</i></p>
<p>For starters, a story like no other: exciting, funny and visually rich. The exact delivery date of the home video and digital downloads versions of <i>Space Rabbit </i>will depend on the distribution life, deadlines, limitations of the project. At present, we expect it to be finished and ready to show in fall, 2018.</p>
<p>Beyond that, you'll get to choose from a variety of perks. You could choose a signed edition of one of my books on film and TV (I have a few that are autographed by both myself and Wes Anderson or Oliver Stone). You could assign me to write an essay on the film or TV program of your choice. Or you could have me interview you about a work, or a life experience, that had a profound effect on you, then turn that into the sort of profile that you'd read in a magazine.</p>

<p>You can also receive a voice mail message from one of the puppet characters as a perk - personalized voice mail thank you message from one of the characters, performed by the actor.</p>
<p>The actual puppet characters used in <i>Space Rabbit</i> are available as perks. They're magnificent creations made by skilled puppet designers. Based on your donation level, we will select one or more of the puppet characters, a copy that we will build specially for you, and ship them to you along with a personal thank you from me. These are not stuffed animals or sock puppets, but fully articulated ""hero"" puppets, similar to the puppets in the test scene above, that are of sufficiently high quality to anchor a movie or TV show.</p>

The show is produced by Sujewa Ekanayake, who produced the test scene at the top of this page and have produced six features and many other film and video projects, and owns and blogs at the well-ranked independent film blog <i>DIY Filmmaker</i>.  The show's co-writer and editor, Steven Santos, is a 20-year veteran of the television industry, and has edited programs for Discovery, A&amp;E, Home &amp; Garden Television, MTV and other networks.</p>

<p>During the fundraising campaign in March we will highlight other members of our talented creative team.</p>
<p>Based on our experiences on previous projects and our experience with the test scene above, we feel confident that we will be able create a polished, satisfying TV show pilot episode  - containing custom built puppets and sets - at a low budget independent film type budget.</p>
<p>That said, due to the epic scale of this project, this is a case where every dollar truly makes a difference. We are creating an entire universe, and although the intimate, hand-made nature of the project is part of its charm, we want this thing to be as ridiculous and amazing as possible. A few extra thousand dollars in the budget could mean the difference between a battle scene that features a dozen puppets and no pyrotechnics or vehicles to one that rivals a Marvel or Star Wars film in its sheer visual excess. A hundred-dollar donation, for example, will buy me two additional groundhog warriors that will be used in the battle sequence that ends the pilot, a bloody puppet clash modeled on Stanley Kubrick's <i>Paths of Glory</i>. This show will feel big regardless; the question is just how big we can make it look?</p>

SPACE RABBIT, a science fiction adventure starring puppets and stuffed animals
 

Matt and Kenolta
My name is Matt Zoller Seitz. I've been a film and TV critic and independent filmmaker for 20 years, but my whole life, I secretly wanted to be Jim Henson. My two children were raised in a version of the world I'd like to inhabit, one filled with eccentric stuffed animal and puppet characters that have psychologies as complex as any human's. The star of this world was Eta P. Squirrel, a rodent born in Kentucky who remade herself as a wisecracking New York dame. Supporting characters included Dusty Rabbit, who was dumb as a carrot but loyal to his friends; Senor Kitty, a dashing Chilean alley cat who dressed like Cary Grant and prized dignity above all else; and Margareta von Colada, a Siamese cat whose acting ability would dazzle Meryl Streep. These performers and more will appear in Space Rabbit. 

SPACE RABBIT is the first film project for this group of tiny but passionate puppet actors: an epic tale of conspiracy, in which a band of unlikely heroes tries to prevent their humble republic from falling into a dictator's paws. Some scenes will be shot on miniature sets, which will then be used as rear-screen projected backdrops for the puppets.  Other scenes will be shot on full size, hand puppet-scale sets, half the size of human soundstages.  But the style will always be gloriously cinematic, treating these handmade settings and characters as if they were existing worlds shot by the crew of an epic that expected to sweep the Oscars. The story includes a number of elaborate action scenes, constructed for maximum suspense even though they might end with, say, a duck dropping a toy piano on an elephant's head.

What do we need to make SPACE RABBIT?
We are raising money to make the pilot episode of season 1 of Space Rabbit.  This project started off as a feature length film, then we realized that there are so many amazing characters and scenes that the story is best told as at least an 8 episode television show.  We hope to create a mesmerizing pilot episode and then convince a TV distributor or network to fund the rest of the season.  If that plan doesn't come to fruition, we may either finish season 1 on our own using means available to us and then try to self distribute it, perhaps through internet Video on Demand, DVD, Blu Ray; or we may integrate what we've shot into a self-contained feature film, then send the film to festivals, seek distribution, or self-distribute.
SPACE RABBIT needs your donations to bring this story to life, put it on screens of all kinds and sizes, and most importantly, to entertain.
We need funds to design and build original puppet characters—in some cases whole armies of characters—and construct the world they inhabit: everything from a jazz club, a swanky bachelor pad, and a decadent throne room to animal- and food-shaped hovercrafts, dense city skylines, and spectacular landscapes. These will have to be built from wood, paper, plastic,  discarded appliances and office supplies, and perhaps furniture we rescued from city dumps and our parents' garages (everything is raw material as far as we're concerned). And of course we will need to pay for professional puppeteers, voice actors, camera and lighting equipment, and food for the cast and crew during the summer 2017 filming period.
Part of the money raised will be set aside to promote and distribute Space Rabbit and get it out in front of people who will love it - especially if  we end up having to self-distribute the project. If we end up self-distributing on internet VOD, we will use the distribution funds to create an effective marketing campaign, and creating home video versions of the project; high quality DVDs and Blu-Rays.

If the project's ultimate form ends up being a movie, we might need to create a high-quality version of Space Rabbit that can be screened at film festivals, then pay for the festival admission fees and travel expenses. We would also need to pay for online and other marketing, DVDs and Blu-rays, and theatrical screenings for critics and distributors.
We will work towards getting the best deals possible on work space rental, storage, puppets, sets, voice actors, film equipment and crew, editing, sound recording and music. 
Once the project is done, we will tell donors how the money was spent.

What do you get if you donate to SPACE RABBIT? 
NOTE: When a perk says ""movie"" re: Space Rabbit, we mean the show/TV show.  Earlier descriptions of project got locked in once donors claimed a given perk, cannot be edited after that point.
For starters, a story like no other: exciting, funny and visually rich. The exact delivery date of the home video and digital downloads versions of Space Rabbit will depend on the distribution life, deadlines, limitations of the project. At present, we expect it to be finished and ready to show in fall, 2018.
Beyond that, you'll get to choose from a variety of perks. You could choose a signed edition of one of my books on film and TV (I have a few that are autographed by both myself and Wes Anderson or Oliver Stone). You could assign me to write an essay on the film or TV program of your choice. Or you could have me interview you about a work, or a life experience, that had a profound effect on you, then turn that into the sort of profile that you'd read in a magazine.

You can also receive a voice mail message from one of the puppet characters as a perk - personalized voice mail thank you message from one of the characters, performed by the actor.
The actual puppet characters used in Space Rabbit are available as perks. They're magnificent creations made by skilled puppet designers. Based on your donation level, we will select one or more of the puppet characters, a copy that we will build specially for you, and ship them to you along with a personal thank you from me. These are not stuffed animals or sock puppets, but fully articulated ""hero"" puppets, similar to the puppets in the test scene above, that are of sufficiently high quality to anchor a movie or TV show.


 
The Task Ahead & Why We Need Your Donations
I have a lot of experience making independent films and documentaries about film history and style, and I am surrounding myself with experienced performers and crew; puppeteers, production designers, set builders, cinematographers, editors and sound experts. The show is produced by Sujewa Ekanayake, who produced the test scene at the top of this page and have produced six features and many other film and video projects, and owns and blogs at the well-ranked independent film blog DIY Filmmaker.  The show's co-writer and editor, Steven Santos, is a 20-year veteran of the television industry, and has edited programs for Discovery, A&E, Home & Garden Television, MTV and other networks.

During the fundraising campaign in March we will highlight other members of our talented creative team.
Based on our experiences on previous projects and our experience with the test scene above, we feel confident that we will be able create a polished, satisfying TV show pilot episode  - containing custom built puppets and sets - at a low budget independent film type budget.
That said, due to the epic scale of this project, this is a case where every dollar truly makes a difference. We are creating an entire universe, and although the intimate, hand-made nature of the project is part of its charm, we want this thing to be as ridiculous and amazing as possible. A few extra thousand dollars in the budget could mean the difference between a battle scene that features a dozen puppets and no pyrotechnics or vehicles to one that rivals a Marvel or Star Wars film in its sheer visual excess. A hundred-dollar donation, for example, will buy me two additional groundhog warriors that will be used in the battle sequence that ends the pilot, a bloody puppet clash modeled on Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory. This show will feel big regardless; the question is just how big we can make it look?
That's where you come in.

What other ways can you help?
Even if you can't contribute money, you can help us by telling people about the Space Rabbit IndieGoGo campaign, recommending our Facebook and Twitter pages, and sharing the many photos and sketches and behind-the-scenes videos and puppet character videos that we will post during the fundraising period.  All assistance is greatly appreciated.

By supporting our project, you’re directly contributing to the progress of our collaboration.</p><p>Our names are Brittney Cooper, Kyle Friedman, and Jake Orloff, we’re film/photography students at Ithaca College and the creators of <i>A Piece of Art</i>. This show is more than a pet project to us, it’s the goal of simultaneously creating a feelgood comedy while fostering an educational environment for film students. We hope you’ll read on and enjoy what we have to offer!</p><p> </p><h2>
<i>A Piece of Art</i> - The Rundown</h2><p> </p><p>Have you ever seen a blank portrait being sold for $413,000 and said, “who would buy that?”</p><p>Or sat through your middle schooler’s improv performance and thought, “whose parents let them do that?”</p><p>And surely you’ve seen the occasional viral video of a runway model showing off a dress made of graham crackers and you’ve just thought, “why?”</p><p> </p><p><i>A Piece of Art</i> seeks to answer these deeply philosophical questions about art. Our mockumentary follows three high school artists competing for an art scholarship to the University of Louisville—A cult-indoctrinated painter, a sellout actress, and a completely uncoordinated fashion designer race to create their pieces of art.</p><p><i>A Piece of Art</i> airs on Ithaca College Television (ICTV), a renowned college television channel that has won plenty of accolades. If you want to see the Spring 2021 line-up or watch more programs from ICTV, visit <u>ICTV.org</u>.</p><p> </p><h3>Our Perks &amp; Goals</h3><p>When we first stepped foot into college, we noticed a trend: a broadening gap between experienced upperclassmen and impassioned underclassmen, but not many bridges in between. That’s why, since we developed the idea for <i>A Piece of Art</i>, our main goal was to bring these two groups closer together and foster a learning environment. We’ve been in production since December 2019 and we are proud of the steps we’ve taken to achieve our ambitions.</p><p>After successful pre-production, our community would love to bring this story to life and we can’t do it without your contribution. Every single donation received will go into our budget for the safety and quality of our production, and we cannot thank you enough for it. That’s why we want to return the favor! Here are a few perks you can receive for contributing to our campaign:</p><p>•<u>Personal Thank-You Note!</u> - We appreciate you so much, maybe we’ll dot our i’s with hearts.</p><p>•<u>An <i>A Piece of Art</i> Laptop Sticker!</u> - You can put it on other things too, we won’t tattle.</p><p>•<u>Behind-The-Scenes Footage!</u> - If we catch someone drop ice cream on their pants on film, you can bet you’ll be the first to watch.</p><p>•<u>The Full, Uncut Episodes!</u> - Spoil the extra parts to your coworkers in the office kitchen and watch everyone get mad at you.</p><p>•<u>And more!</u> - That’s right, we went nonspecific on you. Check out our tiers for more info!</p><p> </p><p>Our financial goal seems like a pretty penny, but filmmaking is anything but cheap. It’s important you know where your money’s going, so we’ve laid out our budget for you.</p><p>•<u>Health Safety</u>: We pledged to provide hand sanitizer, disposable masks/gloves, and disinfectant on all our sets this spring. We take the critical issue of COVID-19 extremely seriously, and you can find our safety plan farther down.</p><p>•<u>Equipmen</u>t: As hard as we can try, it would be ambitious to create a TV show without a camera. We’re raising funds to obtain better equipment to present our story to you with our best foot forward.</p><p>•<u>Props/Location</u>: World-building is much harder than it seems. We tried a dry run without any props and locations and… well, it wasn’t great. That’s why our budget will also go to renting safe locations and constructing props.</p><p>•<u>Food for Cast/Crew</u>: You should see a film set before lunch and compare it to a film set after lunch. Considering all the hard work our cast and crew dedicates to the show, this is crucial.</p><p> </p><h3>A Small Note</h3><p>It’s not like college students to ask for money… cough... but we want to reiterate how important to us your contributions are. Whether you’re here to donate, share with friends, or DM to Tiger Woods (which reminds us, please DM this campaign to Tiger Woods), we cannot express how much we appreciate your support. By taking time out of your day to read this, you’re helping us an incredible amount. Thank you, and we hope you’ll watch <i>A Piece of Art</i> after our production in Spring 2021!</p><p> </p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>2020 has taught us that plans change. Events are canceled, postponed, accidentally reserved at landscaping companies instead of luxury hotels… That’s why we have prepared for the chance that school may revert to remote education.

A Piece of Art is more than a TV show, we’re a team project of more than 50+ students collaborating to create a passionate and truly fantastic program. By supporting our project, you’re directly contributing to the progress of our collaboration.Our names are Brittney Cooper, Kyle Friedman, and Jake Orloff, we’re film/photography students at Ithaca College and the creators of A Piece of Art. This show is more than a pet project to us, it’s the goal of simultaneously creating a feelgood comedy while fostering an educational environment for film students. We hope you’ll read on and enjoy what we have to offer! 
A Piece of Art - The Rundown Have you ever seen a blank portrait being sold for $413,000 and said, “who would buy that?”Or sat through your middle schooler’s improv performance and thought, “whose parents let them do that?”And surely you’ve seen the occasional viral video of a runway model showing off a dress made of graham crackers and you’ve just thought, “why?” A Piece of Art seeks to answer these deeply philosophical questions about art. Our mockumentary follows three high school artists competing for an art scholarship to the University of Louisville—A cult-indoctrinated painter, a sellout actress, and a completely uncoordinated fashion designer race to create their pieces of art.A Piece of Art airs on Ithaca College Television (ICTV), a renowned college television channel that has won plenty of accolades. If you want to see the Spring 2021 line-up or watch more programs from ICTV, visit ICTV.org. Our Perks & GoalsWhen we first stepped foot into college, we noticed a trend: a broadening gap between experienced upperclassmen and impassioned underclassmen, but not many bridges in between. That’s why, since we developed the idea for A Piece of Art, our main goal was to bring these two groups closer together and foster a learning environment. We’ve been in production since December 2019 and we are proud of the steps we’ve taken to achieve our ambitions.After successful pre-production, our community would love to bring this story to life and we can’t do it without your contribution. Every single donation received will go into our budget for the safety and quality of our production, and we cannot thank you enough for it. That’s why we want to return the favor! Here are a few perks you can receive for contributing to our campaign:•Personal Thank-You Note! - We appreciate you so much, maybe we’ll dot our i’s with hearts.•An A Piece of Art Laptop Sticker! - You can put it on other things too, we won’t tattle.•Behind-The-Scenes Footage! - If we catch someone drop ice cream on their pants on film, you can bet you’ll be the first to watch.•The Full, Uncut Episodes! - Spoil the extra parts to your coworkers in the office kitchen and watch everyone get mad at you.•And more! - That’s right, we went nonspecific on you. Check out our tiers for more info! Our financial goal seems like a pretty penny, but filmmaking is anything but cheap. It’s important you know where your money’s going, so we’ve laid out our budget for you.•Health Safety: We pledged to provide hand sanitizer, disposable masks/gloves, and disinfectant on all our sets this spring. We take the critical issue of COVID-19 extremely seriously, and you can find our safety plan farther down.•Equipment: As hard as we can try, it would be ambitious to create a TV show without a camera. We’re raising funds to obtain better equipment to present our story to you with our best foot forward.•Props/Location: World-building is much harder than it seems. We tried a dry run without any props and locations and… well, it wasn’t great. That’s why our budget will also go to renting safe locations and constructing props.•Food for Cast/Crew: You should see a film set before lunch and compare it to a film set after lunch. Considering all the hard work our cast and crew dedicates to the show, this is crucial. A Small NoteIt’s not like college students to ask for money… cough... but we want to reiterate how important to us your contributions are. Whether you’re here to donate, share with friends, or DM to Tiger Woods (which reminds us, please DM this campaign to Tiger Woods), we cannot express how much we appreciate your support. By taking time out of your day to read this, you’re helping us an incredible amount. Thank you, and we hope you’ll watch A Piece of Art after our production in Spring 2021! Risks & Challenges2020 has taught us that plans change. Events are canceled, postponed, accidentally reserved at landscaping companies instead of luxury hotels… That’s why we have prepared for the chance that school may revert to remote education. Because of this possibility, we are planning to finish filming our pilot only three weeks into production, postponing the production of the remaining five episodes to Fall 2021 if needed.As stated earlier, we take the health of our cast and crew very seriously.

<p><strong>Hakim</strong></p>
<p><strong>Karim Lasmi</strong></p>
<p>Hakim est un avocat qui a beaucoup de succès ! </p>
<p>Rien ne lui résiste, il gagne tous ses procès, même les causes les plus perdues. </p>
<p>Son succès dans les tribunaux, son charisme naturel et le milieu dont il est issu (fils d'immigrés qui a grandi dans un quartier défavorisé) lui vaut une couverture médiatique digne des plus grandes stars du show business. </p>
<p>Une couverture médiatique qu'il apprécie; d'ailleurs Hakim n'aime pas grand chose en dehors de lui-même...</p>
<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1610200311/mupgoak1twcr05x8w5ir.png"" src=""""/><p><strong>Jacques</strong></p>
<p><i><strong>en cours de casting</strong></i></p>
<p>La couverture médiatique d’Hakim, cette arrogance et cette invulnérabilité vont irriter Jacques, un policier qui voit en lui le sabotage récurrent du travail de la police. Impossible de mettre quelqu'un derrière les barreaux quand on a Hakim en avocat. </p>
<p>Et Jacques n'a pas peur de se faire justice lui-même et de s'écarter de la loi quand il a quelqu'un dans son viseur...</p>
<p> </p>

<p><strong>Christelle </strong></p>
<p><strong>Lara Sberveglieri</strong></p>
<p>Christelle est une jeune policière, co-équipière de Jacques. </p>
<p>C'est la policière exemplaire, elle espère en apprendre beaucoup sur le terrain grâce aux années d'expérience de son co-équipier même si elle n'est pas spécialement fan de ses méthodes. </p>
<p>Christelle devra faire un choix : suivre son coéquipier et sortir du cadre de la loi pour défendre les intérêts de la police face à un avocat imbattable dans les tribunaux ou rester intègre et suivre la loi. Mais ceux qui font la loi sont-ils vraiment intègres ?</p>

<p><strong>Interprété par Khadim Dione</strong></p>
<p>Docteur K est toujours dans les parages quand on parle d'argent et de vice. </p>
<p>Cette fois-ci, il a pour client Hakim, un avocat riche et intelligent qu'on ne berne pas facilement. A priori un bon client pour Docteur K, mais quels sont vraiment les critères pour être un bon client de Docteur K ?</p>
<p>Hakim en a les moyens financiers mais en a t-il les moyens moraux ?</p> <p>Vous l’avez compris l’épisode pilote vous plongera dans une enquête policière menée par Jacques autour de Hakim l’avocat à succès.

<p> </p>
<p>Nous sommes ambitieux :</p>
<p>Le but de ce pilote est de créer un vrai buzz sur internet autour de Docteur K. Comme pour le trailer, il y aura aussi une grosse communication autour du pilote. D’ailleurs comme le trailer, l’épisode pilote sera diffusé sur Youtube et Facebook.</p>
<p>Et nous visons le million de vues !</p>
<p>Cette audience et cet engagement de votre part (en finançant le pilote), va nous permettre d'attirer les grandes plateformes de streaming (Netflix, Amazon, OCS...etc) et trouver les financements qui nous permettront de vous proposer Docteur K sur plusieurs saisons !</p>
<p>Nous avons tout mis en place : l’écriture du scénario, les lieux, le budget, le casting. Imaginez le trailer que vous venez de voir avec un budget de 25k€ et 20 minutes de plus ! </p>
<p>Il ne manque plus que vous pour concrétiser ce projet.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Comme évoqué dans l’interview du scénariste, le pilote est un épisode beaucoup plus long avec des figurants, plusieurs lieux, plus de personnages. Tout ceci demande beaucoup de personnels et de moyens techniques. </p>
<p>Ces derniers sont nos deux plus gros pôles budgétaires.</p>

<p>Par exemple Docteur K et son client avocat seront dans plusieurs scènes à l’extérieur.

<p><i>Docteur K s’habille de manière soignée, il reçoit ses clients dans des grands bureaux et s’adresse à des personnes puissantes ayant l’esprit plutôt cartésien (police, politique, avocat, mannequin, acteur, narcotrafiquant...etc).</i></p>
<p><i>Dans la série Docteur K, le maraboutisme est une affaire sérieuse !</i></p>
<p><i>Le but de la série est de confronter deux mondes complètement différents : l’occident moderne et le mysticisme africain.</i></p>
<p><i>Dans la série, Docteur K n’est pas sollicité pour des raisons médicales mais pour des problèmes que la société moderne n’a pas encore su résoudre (vengeance, gloire, réussite, amour...etc)</i></p>
<p><i>Docteur K est aussi la rencontre entre le maraboutisme africain et le côté sombre d’autres milieux qui fascinent. La politique, le show business, le monde judiciaire sont des mondes qui fascinent. </i></p>
<p><i>Avec cette série nous avons voulu montrer que derrière même les milieux les plus respectables, les côtés les plus sombres de l’être humain peuvent se cacher.</i></p>

<p>Le couple Underwood est vicieux et ambitieux, c'est ce trait de caractère qui m'a inspiré pour la série Docteur K. Franck et Claire Underwood vont toujours plus loin et n'ont aucune limite pour arriver à leurs fins.</p>
<p>C'est aussi le cas pour Docteur K et ses clients. Les clients de docteur K ne viennent pas le voir pour de bonnes intentions ! Ils sont tous animés de ce vice que l'on retrouve chez les Underwoods.</p>
<p>La série House of cards ne met pas seulement en avant le trait sombre de leur caractère, elle met aussi en avant l'intelligence du couple. C'est aussi ce que nous mettrons en avant dans les futurs épisodes :</p>
<p>L'intelligence de Docteur K. </p>
<p>Docteur K n'est pas une caricature du vilain bête et méchant. C'est un personnage plus subtil qui défend ses propres intérêts grâce à ses pouvoirs mystiques mais surtout grâce à son intelligence et sa force de caractère.</p>

<p>Dans Black Mirror la technologie améliore notre quotidien et peut aussi le transformer en cauchemar quand on en abuse. Au delà de l'impact sur la vie des personnages, la série Black Mirror nous amène à nous poser des questions sur l'impact des technologies sur notre quotidien. </p>
<p>Avec Docteur K, la magie noire remplace la technologie.</p>
<p>A chaque nouvelle histoire Docteur K utilise des pouvoirs mystiques pour ses clients.Il leur permet d'abord d'assouvir leur désir les plus fous. Mais ses sortilèges ne sont jamais sans conséquence sur ses clients. Il y a toujours un prix à payer.</p>
<p>La magie ici est un outil qui repousse les limites de notre vie quotidienne, tout comme la technologie de Black Mirror. La magie noire va vous amener à vous poser des questions sur votre quotidien et sur la société dans laquelle vous voudriez vivre.</p>

<p>Dans la pop culture, il y a très peu de héros africains en dehors des personnages historiques, et des anti-héros encore moins.</p>
<p>Au delà de l’univers de la série, j’ai voulu faire du personnage de Docteur K une icône. Le premier antagoniste africain ! Joker a un style vestimentaire, une manière d’éliminer ses ennemis (gadgets, gaz hilarants...etc.). </p>
<p>Bien que n’évoluant pas dans l’univers des super-héros, Docteur K a son style vestimentaire bien reconnaissable (chapeau, bagues aux doigts, costumes) et sa manière d’éliminer ses ennemis (sortilèges africains).</p>
<p>Joker est dans nos esprits, il est facilement reconnaissable. Notre but c’est que Docteur K devienne aussi facilement reconnaissable et marque les esprits.</p>
<p>Pour arriver à ce niveau de reconnaissance cela peut prendre des années et la 1ère étape commence ici avec cette campagne de crowdfunding.</p>

</div></div>","Vous avez déjà entendu parler de sorcellerie africaine...
Vous savez que l'Afrique regorge de légendes plus fascinantes les unes que les autres.
Mais vous êtes frustrés par leurs raretés dans les séries et films qui vous sont proposés.
Et quand ces légendes sont abordées, les personnages qui les incarnent vous semblent peu modernes, grotesques et moqueurs.
Vous voulez que cela change ?
Soutenez-nous et ensemble valorisons les légendes africaines à travers un projet moderne et ambitieux :
La série Doctor K
 

 
 
Doctor K est le marabout des stars, des hommes politiques et des criminels en tous genres. Ces hommes d'influence le consultent pour assouvir en secret leurs vices les plus immoraux.
Pour cela, ils sont prêts à payer une fortune. Mais ce qu'ils ignorent c'est qu'avec Doctor K, il y a toujours un prix caché bien plus cher que l'argent…
 

 
Parce que c'est votre série !
Sans vous et votre soutien, ce projet ne verra pas le jour avec les moyens qu'il mérite.
Grâce à vos dons le prochain épisode durera 20 minutes.
Avec plus d'acteurs, de lieux et de moyens techniques.
Son succès dépends de vous. 
Etes vous prêt à relever le défi ?
 


 
 
 

 

Hakim
Karim Lasmi
Hakim est un avocat qui a beaucoup de succès ! 
Rien ne lui résiste, il gagne tous ses procès, même les causes les plus perdues. 
Son succès dans les tribunaux, son charisme naturel et le milieu dont il est issu (fils d'immigrés qui a grandi dans un quartier défavorisé) lui vaut une couverture médiatique digne des plus grandes stars du show business. 
Une couverture médiatique qu'il apprécie; d'ailleurs Hakim n'aime pas grand chose en dehors de lui-même...
Jacques
en cours de casting
La couverture médiatique d’Hakim, cette arrogance et cette invulnérabilité vont irriter Jacques, un policier qui voit en lui le sabotage récurrent du travail de la police. Impossible de mettre quelqu'un derrière les barreaux quand on a Hakim en avocat. 
Et Jacques n'a pas peur de se faire justice lui-même et de s'écarter de la loi quand il a quelqu'un dans son viseur...
 

Christelle 
Lara Sberveglieri
Christelle est une jeune policière, co-équipière de Jacques. 
C'est la policière exemplaire, elle espère en apprendre beaucoup sur le terrain grâce aux années d'expérience de son co-équipier même si elle n'est pas spécialement fan de ses méthodes. 
Christelle devra faire un choix : suivre son coéquipier et sortir du cadre de la loi pour défendre les intérêts de la police face à un avocat imbattable dans les tribunaux ou rester intègre et suivre la loi. Mais ceux qui font la loi sont-ils vraiment intègres ?
 Docteur K
Interprété par Khadim Dione
Docteur K est toujours dans les parages quand on parle d'argent et de vice. 
Cette fois-ci, il a pour client Hakim, un avocat riche et intelligent qu'on ne berne pas facilement. A priori un bon client pour Docteur K, mais quels sont vraiment les critères pour être un bon client de Docteur K ?
Hakim en a les moyens financiers mais en a t-il les moyens moraux ? Vous l’avez compris l’épisode pilote vous plongera dans une enquête policière menée par Jacques autour de Hakim l’avocat à succès. A travers l’enquête borderline de Jacques nous verrons à quel point Hakim est prêt à payer son succès auprès de Docteur K.
 

 
Nous sommes ambitieux :
Le but de ce pilote est de créer un vrai buzz sur internet autour de Docteur K. Comme pour le trailer, il y aura aussi une grosse communication autour du pilote. D’ailleurs comme le trailer, l’épisode pilote sera diffusé sur Youtube et Facebook.
Et nous visons le million de vues !
Cette audience et cet engagement de votre part (en finançant le pilote), va nous permettre d'attirer les grandes plateformes de streaming (Netflix, Amazon, OCS...etc) et trouver les financements qui nous permettront de vous proposer Docteur K sur plusieurs saisons !
Nous avons tout mis en place : l’écriture du scénario, les lieux, le budget, le casting. Imaginez le trailer que vous venez de voir avec un budget de 25k€ et 20 minutes de plus ! 
Il ne manque plus que vous pour concrétiser ce projet.
 

 
Comme évoqué dans l’interview du scénariste, le pilote est un épisode beaucoup plus long avec des figurants, plusieurs lieux, plus de personnages. Tout ceci demande beaucoup de personnels et de moyens techniques. 
Ces derniers sont nos deux plus gros pôles budgétaires.
 

 

Par exemple Docteur K et son client avocat seront dans plusieurs scènes à l’extérieur. Des personnages de cet envergure doivent s’habiller de manière élégante et conduire des véhicules à la hauteur de leur réputation. Plus nous avons de budget, plus nous pourrons vous proposer un épisode pilote riche visuellement et de qualité, que ce soit au niveau du son, des images ou du encore du décor.
 

 

 
Nous avons réalisé ce trailer avec 0€ de budget pour vous donner le ton de la série mais aussi pour vous montrer notre créativité et ce que l’on est capable de faire.
 

 
Docteur K s’habille de manière soignée, il reçoit ses clients dans des grands bureaux et s’adresse à des personnes puissantes ayant l’esprit plutôt cartésien (police, politique, avocat, mannequin, acteur, narcotrafiquant...etc).
Dans la série Docteur K, le maraboutisme est une affaire sérieuse !
Le but de la série est de confronter deux mondes complètement différents : l’occident moderne et le mysticisme africain.
Dans la série, Docteur K n’est pas sollicité pour des raisons médicales mais pour des problèmes que la société moderne n’a pas encore su résoudre (vengeance, gloire, réussite, amour...etc)
Docteur K est aussi la rencontre entre le maraboutisme africain et le côté sombre d’autres milieux qui fascinent. La politique, le show business, le monde judiciaire sont des mondes qui fascinent. 
Avec cette série nous avons voulu montrer que derrière même les milieux les plus respectables, les côtés les plus sombres de l’être humain peuvent se cacher.
 

 

 

Le couple Underwood est vicieux et ambitieux, c'est ce trait de caractère qui m'a inspiré pour la série Docteur K. Franck et Claire Underwood vont toujours plus loin et n'ont aucune limite pour arriver à leurs fins.
C'est aussi le cas pour Docteur K et ses clients. Les clients de docteur K ne viennent pas le voir pour de bonnes intentions ! Ils sont tous animés de ce vice que l'on retrouve chez les Underwoods.
La série House of cards ne met pas seulement en avant le trait sombre de leur caractère, elle met aussi en avant l'intelligence du couple. C'est aussi ce que nous mettrons en avant dans les futurs épisodes :
L'intelligence de Docteur K. 
Docteur K n'est pas une caricature du vilain bête et méchant. C'est un personnage plus subtil qui défend ses propres intérêts grâce à ses pouvoirs mystiques mais surtout grâce à son intelligence et sa force de caractère.
 

 

Dans Black Mirror la technologie améliore notre quotidien et peut aussi le transformer en cauchemar quand on en abuse. Au delà de l'impact sur la vie des personnages, la série Black Mirror nous amène à nous poser des questions sur l'impact des technologies sur notre quotidien. 
Avec Docteur K, la magie noire remplace la technologie.
A chaque nouvelle histoire Docteur K utilise des pouvoirs mystiques pour ses clients.Il leur permet d'abord d'assouvir leur désir les plus fous. Mais ses sortilèges ne sont jamais sans conséquence sur ses clients. Il y a toujours un prix à payer.
La magie ici est un outil qui repousse les limites de notre vie quotidienne, tout comme la technologie de Black Mirror. La magie noire va vous amener à vous poser des questions sur votre quotidien et sur la société dans laquelle vous voudriez vivre.
Seriez-vous un client de Docteur K ? Si oui, quel sortilège utiliseriez-vous ? Et seriez-vous prêt à en payer le prix ?  
Docteur K doit-il exister dans notre société ? Et si finalement Docteur k était d'utilité publique? Une sorte d'ange noir qui punit les personnes les plus mal intentionnées.

 

 
Notre ambition est de créer une série internationale sur Docteur K.
Cette série, c'est la vôtre ! 
Cet univers, ce personnage, ces références culturelles ne verront jamais le jour sans vous.
Vous avez vu ce que nous avons pu réaliser avec 0€ de budget ? 
Imaginez ce que nous pouvons faire avec un budget de 25 000€.
Nous avons fait un 1er pas vers vous avec ce trailer, il ne nous manque plus que vous pour faire le deuxième !
Le financement va nous permettre de faire deux choses :
Réaliser un 1er épisode pilote. 
Mais aussi mesurer le potentiel succès de la série. 
Plus l'engouement est grand, plus la série a de chances d'attirer d'autres investisseurs qui nous aideront à être autonomes, rentables et vous proposer plusieurs saisons que vous retrouverez sur vos plateformes de streaming préférées (Netflix, Amazon, OCS...etc)
 

 

 
Dans la pop culture, il y a très peu de héros africains en dehors des personnages historiques, et des anti-héros encore moins.
Au delà de l’univers de la série, j’ai voulu faire du personnage de Docteur K une icône. Le premier antagoniste africain ! Joker a un style vestimentaire, une manière d’éliminer ses ennemis (gadgets, gaz hilarants...etc.). 
Bien que n’évoluant pas dans l’univers des super-héros, Docteur K a son style vestimentaire bien reconnaissable (chapeau, bagues aux doigts, costumes) et sa manière d’éliminer ses ennemis (sortilèges africains).
Joker est dans nos esprits, il est facilement reconnaissable. Notre but c’est que Docteur K devienne aussi facilement reconnaissable et marque les esprits.
Pour arriver à ce niveau de reconnaissance cela peut prendre des années et la 1ère étape commence ici avec cette campagne de crowdfunding.
En nous finançant vous faites entrer Docteur K dans la pop culture.

 
""Etant d’origine camerounaise, les histoires que vivent les personnages de Docteur K me sont familières car souvent racontées par mes parents, oncle ou tante ayant grandit en Afrique. Ces histoires m’ont toujours fait peur et fasciné. 
Mais pas seulement moi, elles fascinaient aussi mes amis occidentaux de souche quand je leur racontais. Car Il existe aussi des marabouts en Europe et en Amérique du nord mais personne n’en parle.
La peur et la fascination du maraboutisme est donc internationale.
Pourtant, j’ai rarement vu ce sujet abordé à la télé ou au cinéma en occident. Il n’y a d’ailleurs aucun personnage de référence dans la culture populaire.
Docteur K est une réponse à ce manque sur ce sujet.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">STORY</h3>
<p>It was a normal Wednesday morning for Melanie Johnson, aspiring singer from Ladera Heights, Melissa Muhammad, slam poet from Inglewood, and Melody Carter, future music producer from Bel Air as they prepared with great anticipation for their first day at the world renowned Holly High Conservatory for the Arts.....normal that is, until they get convinced by their home room teacher Mrs. Wilde to leave school with her unexpectedly.</p>
<p>They get lured away to Edith Mae Academy for Girls, an underground narnia for black girl magic ....</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617322289/iohhpse3jgmo9eb2pbmy.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Melissa</strong>, raised by her older sister Beck in absence of their incarcerated mother, signs on to participate in Edith until she is approached by her childhood bestie Joy to start shoplifting and trading for easy cash. Her new found boosting hustle not only puts her in jeopardy with her seat at Edith, but also gets her in some legal trouble when she gets caught.</p>

<p><strong>Melody</strong>, raised by her two dads Lenny &amp; Tim Carter on the other hand is stoked by the idea of being surrounded by such powerful black women. After all, she has been longing to find her birth mother and finally gets the courage to speak up for herself to her dad about the young woman she is becoming. She is focused and committed to doing her best at Edith, until she gets distracted by her Holly High crush Rich and gets shocked with some interesting findings about her birth mother.</p>

<p><strong>Melanie </strong>wants no parts in any of the “kumbuya bullsh*t”. Her only goal is to become famous at Holly High and frankly Edith is not homegirl's speed. She is distant and combative for most of the season, although she can truly sing her face off. We find out that Melanie secretly struggles with a learning disability. Once she lets her guards down, she gets the support of a lifetime.</p>

<p>I chose to create The Mels because I wanted to show the world a world that only lived inside of my head; a place where every young black girl was taught who she was and WHOSE she was, that she is a product of royalty, heiresses to the throne, and that knowing her true power, her true magic she would have all the abundance her heart could muster up, because it is her destiny... </p>

<p>I was inspired to create this sci fi dramedy by the work of dual reality, multi realm tv shows and films such as Heroes, Lovecraft Country, Get Out and Antebellum.</p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","STORY
It was a normal Wednesday morning for Melanie Johnson, aspiring singer from Ladera Heights, Melissa Muhammad, slam poet from Inglewood, and Melody Carter, future music producer from Bel Air as they prepared with great anticipation for their first day at the world renowned Holly High Conservatory for the Arts.....normal that is, until they get convinced by their home room teacher Mrs. Wilde to leave school with her unexpectedly.
They get lured away to Edith Mae Academy for Girls, an underground narnia for black girl magic ....

Melissa, raised by her older sister Beck in absence of their incarcerated mother, signs on to participate in Edith until she is approached by her childhood bestie Joy to start shoplifting and trading for easy cash. Her new found boosting hustle not only puts her in jeopardy with her seat at Edith, but also gets her in some legal trouble when she gets caught.

Melody, raised by her two dads Lenny & Tim Carter on the other hand is stoked by the idea of being surrounded by such powerful black women. After all, she has been longing to find her birth mother and finally gets the courage to speak up for herself to her dad about the young woman she is becoming. She is focused and committed to doing her best at Edith, until she gets distracted by her Holly High crush Rich and gets shocked with some interesting findings about her birth mother.

Melanie wants no parts in any of the “kumbuya bullsh*t”. Her only goal is to become famous at Holly High and frankly Edith is not homegirl's speed. She is distant and combative for most of the season, although she can truly sing her face off. We find out that Melanie secretly struggles with a learning disability. Once she lets her guards down, she gets the support of a lifetime.

NOTE FROM CREATOR
I chose to create The Mels because I wanted to show the world a world that only lived inside of my head; a place where every young black girl was taught who she was and WHOSE she was, that she is a product of royalty, heiresses to the throne, and that knowing her true power, her true magic she would have all the abundance her heart could muster up, because it is her destiny... 
I wanted the viewers to fantasize with me something that could be and should be in the world. I wanted them to see the vision and not only different lives of the ever- evolving black woman but also how our magic could sometimes disturb others so much that they hate to love it but still try to duplicate it.
I was inspired to create this sci fi dramedy by the work of dual reality, multi realm tv shows and films such as Heroes, Lovecraft Country, Get Out and Antebellum.
We auditioned so many people with great takes on the script and I am so excited to see the actors we selected bring these characters alive. They each had something unique about them and  performed so well, it either grossed us out, pissed us off and moved us to tears. 
Working with the writers and producers was an awesome experience and a great teacher as well. I loved working with other intelligent, supportive, forward thinking, boss ass black queens!  
This show will always be special to me because it is my series baby! My first born! And I promised those girls I would make them a show and I did. I worked on it and worked on it some more and after 2 years, it is ready!

<h3>Phoenix Inc: Season 3</h3>
<p>With your help we have been able to produce 2 short seasons of a fantastic TV show, and now we are ready to go big! If you haven't had a chance to check out the early episodes of our show you find Phoenix Inc on Amazon Prime and YouTube.</p>
<p>Everything in this series so far has been done on a shoestring budget with mostly volunteers to make it all happen. With your help I am seeking the funds to pay everyone who is part of the show, and make sure that our locations, effects, sound and visuals are all top notch. </p>
<p>I believe that we can make a show that can go toe to toe with many other shows out there in terms of quality of the idea, acting, scripting and even visuals and sounds, but that can't be accomplished without the phenomenal people who help us - you! </p>
<p>Independent television is much more difficult than independent movies. It requires more work over time, but the payoff is a far more compelling story that can explore a world much more fully. Season 3 will take this series to new place!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Most TV shows, even on the low end can cost between $500,000 and $1,000,000 per episode. Our goal with this campaign is to raise $50,000 to create up to three 45 minute episodes of the show. We have implemented a wide variety of strategies to keep costs low, while maintaining a high level of professionalism. </p>
<p>The money will be spent to pay all actors, rent and purchase necessary equipment and props and pay for some marketing. </p>
<p>For contributing to this campaign there are numerous perks you can receive based on your level of contribution, but you will also be part of revolutionizing the way that TV is made.</p>
<p>One of the most important aspects of this show is actually the inspiration it is designed to give. It is a show which deals with dark and difficult subject matter, but it does so in a way which is intended to give hope to those who may feel suicidal, and to uplift all viewers. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have a proven track record of delivering a stellar, award winning finished product, however every project has challenges. If we can raise the full $50,000 or more we will make as many episodes as we can, however if we fail to raise the full amount, we will have to scale back in many ways including shooting fewer episodes. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There is a fantastic video coming soon that will discuss this, but in the meantime there are some great things you can do even if you can't contribute today. Like the Phoenix Inc Facebook page, and watch for updates. Invite your friends and family to like the page and help them find this great show. Also please go and watch the episodes, even a few times to help them get recommended more often by the algorithms. Lastly, and most importantly, leave reviews, comments, and recommendations anywhere you can! Reviews on Amazon are very important to help Amazon recommend a show, also YouTube comments and Facebook recommendations are very helpful. </p>
<p>On behalf of the entire dedicated Phoenix Team I want to thank you for considering this project and contributing in any way you can.

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What is PLUGs?</span></h3>
<p>PLUGS is comedy crime drama web series created by Brandon James. The first season of PLUGS introduces our two main protagonists, Jeremy and Tyrone, and gives insight on how two best friends enter into the shroom selling business. Along the way, Jeremy and Tyrone meet a variety of odd and unique characters while discovering the dangers of being criminals.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Who are the Characters?</strong></h2>
<p>Jeremy has always lived an average life. Two-parent household, raised in the church, excelled in school... long story short, he's a clean guy. Jeremy attended one of the best business schools in the U.S., graduating college and not know what to do in life, Jeremy plans on exceeding in life... even if he's $75,000 in debt. </p>
<p>Tyrone on the other hand, always had it easy in life. Living in Los Angeles his entire childhood, entering adulthood was going to be a breeze in Tyrone's head until his parent cut him off. They think it's time for him to fend on his own. Can you blame them? On top of that, Tyrone's ""girlfriend"", Maya cheated on him so yeah... the man's dealing with some stuff. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Vision</h3>
<p>Our vision is to create the first season which consists of 4 episodes ranging from 15-20 minutes each. Each episode that we create will cost around $6,000 dollars. With the $6,000 per episode, we'll be paying for talent, crew, equipment, locations, permits, food, and miscellaneous purchases. </p>
<p>Even if we don't receive the full amount, with however much we receive, we'll at least be making the first episode. That being said, if you want the complete story, donating and spreading the word to your friends and relatives is the only way that we could finish the first season of PLUGS. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>
<p>PLUGS is important to us due to this series being the first portrayal of our abilities of filmmaking. Writer and director Brandon James is currently studying Screenwriting at California State University, Northridge and plans on making this series his gateway into the film/tv industry. </p>
<p>Ciera McGrew is a recent graduate of California State University, Northridge. She is currently pursuing a career in filmmaking, with her goal in becoming a creative producer. She is more than determined to produce unique stories and creative content, especially those that highlight the voices of POC. This project is only the beginning of her vision. </p>

He has written and directed several short films that have played in various film festivals. Keith’s award winning films have been screened at festivals around the world, including Golden Door International Film Festival, Pittsburgh Uncut Film Festival, Seoul Web Fest, NJ Web Fest and Hang Onto Your Short Film Festival among other venues. WHERE WILL YOUR MONEY GO?While it's true filmmaking (or technically, digital filmmaking) has gotten much less expensive in the last few years but still there are costs that can't be avoided and each episode costs a minimum of $2000 to make but the more we can raise, the better! A lot of times our cast and crew are working on a show below their normal rate, because it serves as a passion project for the whole team. Our crew is made up of incredibly passionate and hard working people who have been working for pizza (or occasionally Chinese).  Your money will go towards paying the cast and crew what they deserve to be paid, and ultimately providing the financial means to help each and every one of us give it our all to make ""Herrings"" the visually and narratively compelling series we know it can be.  And now, I present the obligatory pie chart that let's you know EXACTLY where your money will be going:  Other funds will also be put towards providing quality food for set, props and set decorations, and a small contingency budget for miscellaneous needs. WHAT DO I GET IN RETURN?We’re grateful for every single penny that comes our way. No amount is too small or too big! And we have some wonderful perks and incentives to show our gratitude. Things like:

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello everyone, and thank you for checking out this Indiegogo campaign. </p>
<p>My name is Ian Allan James and the tale of ""Spad's Hollow"" has been in my head for over 10 years. When I was 14 years old my friends and I started making short horror films that all took place in the same continuity. Our films were filled with crazy and campy villains that were inspired by  '70s and '80's slasher films. All these characters lived in the fictional town of Spad's Hollow, WV. My friend Jordan Krueger and I have already started a comic series based on these characters but now my Producers and I think it is time for us to explore this twisted saga even more via web series. </p>
<p>This is a project that means a lot to not only me but all of my friends who have helped flesh out these characters and have grown to care about them just as much as me.</p>
<p>We are a small group of friends  that always dreamed of making horror films togther and this is our chance. </p>

<p>Premise: </p>
<p>My Gay Bro is an episodic series which will entail the lives of both Kyle and Wesley. Kyle is your typical straight frat boy who thinks rolling blunts should be considered a sport. Wesley is your gay, frat boy influenced, type of guy who loves cannabis infused candles, or just candles in general. These two hold exciting lives of two roommates who are clearly different, but reciprocate the energy of frat brothers who get into unforeseen dilemmas. Mainly due to their poor, but fun choices; these two make memories worth remembering if they can remember the memories they’re supposed to remember…</p>
<p>Director’s Statement: </p>
<p>A story like this is one not just worth creating, but worth the watch. With the LGBTQ community finally getting their name into the media, and the Full Send party community taking off this is a story of two communities living parallel to each other in harmony. It will be a fun, yet heartfelt journey, these characters will cast themselves in, and the audience has the utter luxury of going for the ride. We are the best ones to tell this story due to the environment the team is surrounded in, closely relating to the one Kyle and Wesley find themselves in. With this familiarity to the circumstances, the team will be relating to the characters, and circumstances just as much as the audience will be which creates not only a healthy product but a well done product. </p>
<p>Bottom Line:</p>
<p>With a goal of $5000, this series will be shot at a speedy pace along with a creative eye to specifics. A majority of the budget will not just be going to production dates, but to marketing. Due to this being a story worth telling, we want to share it with as many people as possible. Instagram marketing will be used to promote this series, and create a following to hopefully produce another great set of episodes in a second season later in the future. The realm of Instagram is a pool of consumers, and this is a product which will grab due to its specific niches and the large following behind those. Donate now to receive a series this world has been dying to see!</p>

<p>Hey everybody! If you’ve made it this far, you’ve probably caught on we are raising money for a new project. We're super excited to announce we're developing a <strong>TV SHOW</strong>. It's a wildly ambitious endeavor and we need help from friends, family, and supporters of the arts to make it happen. </p>
<h3>The Series</h3>
<p>The series is a comedy called <i>CherryBomb</i> and is all about two young, female entrepreneurs finding their purpose and career in New York City. It's a 6-episode season with each episode lasting around 25 minutes. The series is largely based on our previous film,<i>The Dine-and-Dash Dater</i>, which served as the prototype to the tone, style, and comedy. Once finished, we plan to air it on a streaming platform in 2021!</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We think the story is important for a myriad of reasons, but some of the most vital reasons are female empowerment and representation of immigrants in the United States. Not only is our story about strong women, but is also largely being brought to life by them. Half our creative team are women, which as we all know is exceptionally rare for a television series. </p>
<p>Our cast and crew represents 4 continents and 7 countries, which we are really proud of! Typically, international actors are asked to suppress accents &amp; 'play America', but we've decided to embrace the internationality of our cast and creative team. In doing so, we hope to give a voice to communities that otherwise would remain unrepresented in American Pop-Culture. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>It's no secret that filmmaking is a really expensive process. The greatest expenses are film and audio equipment, craft services, and props/costumes. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1594683053/at78pbmxlvyttmcupcv2.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>""Craft Services"" is code in the movie world for food and drinks. It's a huge portion of our budget, but it can't be overstated how important it is. Because we can't pay our cast and crew, we at least have to feed them. Craft Services is one of the most critical elements to boosting on-set morale and building a creative atmosphere. Everyone works better after a toasted Everything bagel with cream cheese. It's simple science.</p>

The series is largely based on our previous film,The Dine-and-Dash Dater, which served as the prototype to the tone, style, and comedy. Once finished, we plan to air it on a streaming platform in 2021!
The Impact
We think the story is important for a myriad of reasons, but some of the most vital reasons are female empowerment and representation of immigrants in the United States. Not only is our story about strong women, but is also largely being brought to life by them. Half our creative team are women, which as we all know is exceptionally rare for a television series. 
Our cast and crew represents 4 continents and 7 countries, which we are really proud of! Typically, international actors are asked to suppress accents & 'play America', but we've decided to embrace the internationality of our cast and creative team. In doing so, we hope to give a voice to communities that otherwise would remain unrepresented in American Pop-Culture. 

What We Need
It's no secret that filmmaking is a really expensive process. The greatest expenses are film and audio equipment, craft services, and props/costumes. 

""Craft Services"" is code in the movie world for food and drinks. It's a huge portion of our budget, but it can't be overstated how important it is. Because we can't pay our cast and crew, we at least have to feed them. Craft Services is one of the most critical elements to boosting on-set morale and building a creative atmosphere. Everyone works better after a toasted Everything bagel with cream cheese. It's simple science.

Think the buddy comedy vibe of New Girl, mixed with the concepts of The Good Place, mixed with the familiar lovability of Broad City (watch out Abbi and Illana) ((jk love you))  The webseries began as a passion project for us to create our own content, but collaborative efforts from over 30 other talented artists allowed the project to grow in both professionalism and support.  Dead Friends was created by Nicole Murray and Paige Henderson (Svelte Dog Productions), is produced by Phong Dang, and stars Paige Henderson, Nicole Murray, Jacob Osborne and Chase Michael Torrence. And guess what? The first two episodes, which completed production last October, have already been official selection for various film festivals, where they have been nominated for Best Pilot, Best Dramedy, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress and have already won Best Webisode. Pretty dope. BUT WAIT, YOU ALREADY COMPLETED FILMING? YES! With the completion and success of episodes 1 and 2 (see nominations above) we were able to film the rest of Season One in May, thanks to the support of our cast, crew, artistic collaborations and local businesses.  BUT, as anyone who has worked in film knows, it is not enough just to shoot the thing. Now comes post-production, which means editing, color correcting, and sound design. We need help in order to achieve the funds necessary to hire talented individuals for these areas, and ensure the post-production process produces the best film quality possible! SO WHAT THE HECK DO YOU NEED: We are looking to raise $5,000 for post-production on episodes 3-8 of Dead Friends so that we may complete the season and release it out on Youtube!These funds would go toward sound design, color correction, and marketing of the series for it to be seen and (hopefully) loved. Dead Friends relies heavily on sound design to convey the characteristics of the spirit world, (see an example of this in our Campaign Video!) Additionally, color correction is necessary for the supernatural occurrences and characters. And of course, having money for marketing is super important for us to be able to share our series with as many people as possible!Our plan is to release the full season in October, just in time for Halloween (get ready to bingeeeee). OKAY COOL, BUT WHY SHOULD I CARE? First off, who doesn’t like to laugh. Weirdos.But, seriously, more than just characterized by a light-hearted comedy atmosphere, Dead Friends deals with relevant themes of the afterlife, self-acceptance, and the boundaries of friendship.Dead Friends addresses these in often humorous scenarios while getting real in moments everyone can relate to. Our characters are awkward, witty, lovable, and maybe even a little manic. They seek love and acceptance, doubt themselves, and get carried away in the moment, just as everyone does. We love our characters to death (lol), and we hope you’ll have as much fun watching them as we did writing them and seeing them brought to life (lol) by our talented cast.Our hope? That this first season of Dead Friends will just be the beginning. Successful web series such as “Strangers” have achieved this goal; being found and loved, and eventually getting their series picked up by Facebook Watch. We have a lot more of this story to tell, and we want to continue making people laugh for 10 more seasons. Jk. But maybe like 9. SOUNDS DOPE, BUT…. We know. There is the possibility that we may not get enough funding for us to complete Dead Friends to the best quality it can be. If we aren’t able to raise enough money, we would need to wait until we gained funding in order to get the series out onto our Youtube platform. However, we believe strongly in this series and the messages it carries with it, so will work as long as it takes to gain the funds to release. I CAN’T DONATE, BUT I WANNA HELP: If you’re not able to support financially, no worries!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Ikiyago WebTV is for us a Television of proximity with a vision of sharing, educating and learn through the truth.  We believe, sharing our ideas, experiences, stories and learning from others through audiovisual means seems to be a key to understanding the challenges of development and the future construction of the country. It`s also a place of entertainment. Our shows are streamed live (or pre-recorded) on our YouTube Channel <strong>Ikiyago WebTV </strong>and later published on our new website <a href=""http://www.ikiyagowebtv.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.ikiyagowebtv.org</a><strong>.</strong></p>
<p>Ikiyago WebTV is for us an instrument of exchange and encounter that creates links between Burundians and friends of Burundi wherever they are in the world. Our great desire is to make this meeting place an instrument that allows communication and information to take a place in the processes of the development of our country.</p>
<p>Burundi is a small country in Eastern Africa that has been going through cyclical crisis since its independence in 1962. Because of those crisis, Burundi has several issues ranging from politics to economy to security to justice to hanger and poverty.</p>
<p>This meeting place was created to get all Burundians and friends of Burundi together through true dialogue to share ideas and solutions to actual problems and the development of Burundi communities.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We're looking to raise $ 7,736.99 to help create an agency in Burundi. We have a small but complete studio set up in Seattle that started live programs on our YouTube channel last year in April, and need to increase our video contents by creating another small studio in Burundi, the very first place we can find most important sources for our programs.</p>
<p>All the Ikiyago WebTV crew work on the volunteer basis (for free) and that`s why we are developing so quickly. We would very much like to able to create another small studio in Burundi. For that we need your help to buy 2 cameras JVC GY-HM170UA ($2,675.00), 1 Dell Precision Tower 3420 ($1,596.99), 1 laptop Dell Latitude 13 3000 ($1,570.00) and 1 Video mixer Roland VR-3EX SD/HD A/V with USB streaming ($1,895.00). We already have other equipment such as audio mixer, microphones, lights, cables, rented office and volunteer crew members.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is valuable to you as a contributor and to the world as you will help us share ideas, experiences, stories and skills that would contribute to community development in Burundi. You will also notice the difference your contribution is making in Burundian communities and also follow our coverage on issue affecting Burundi communities.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Ikiyago WebTV, a place of meeting, is registered as a non-profit organization under Washington State law and has signed-up membership with Seattle Community Media to have its video contents aired on Comcast channel 77 and wave broadband channel.</p>
<p>We are in the process of registering our representative agency in Burundi. Our legal status in the US is a strong element to influence the Burundian government to grant us a license to have an agency in Burundi.</p>
<p>We know people value our transparency and may wonder what would be our plan in case the Burundi government refuse to grant us the license to open an agency there. We have Studio that is operational in Seattle that will continue to operate as usual and we we look for other opportunities of creating other representative agencies in countries with higher number of Burundian immigrants such as South Africa, Canada and Sweden (where we have volunteer members).</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>It`s true that some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help. If you like what we're doing please give us a share on Indiegogo, Facebook, Twitter etc., or if you are in possession of any used studio equipment please contact us and we will appreciate from the bottom of our heart.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>From the group that brought the remarkable stage experience <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcY5K7jqYUk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong><i>Kaleidoscope</i></strong></a> to Atlanta, GA, we present to you an original web series titled: <strong>IN PURSUIT, DANCE!</strong>™  </p>
<p>Marcus, Loretta, Ethan &amp; Misty are each at varying stages of life, in circumstances shaped by their distinctive backgrounds, experiences, and complexes. In sharing their personal stories, ambitions, and challenges, we give viewers an opportunity to watch - and possibly relate - as these individuals navigate thoughts and emotions that bug them down in their mundane day to day.  You will also witness how dance can freely unknot burdens, take away stress, and reduce anxiety and depression. </p>
<h3>The Why</h3>
<p><strong>Did you know? </strong><i>20 years of research suggest that Dance/Movement Therapy (DMT) and dance are effective for increasing quality of life and decreasing clinical symptoms such as <u>depression and anxiety</u>. Positive effects were also found on the increase of subjective well-being, positive mood, affect, and body image</i>**. </p>
<p>Through this series, we seek to highlight deep struggles faced by dancers, dance enthusiasts, and even non-dancers as we navigate everyday living. We then shine the spotlight on this not-so-popular application of dance i.e. dance therapy and persuade the viewer to dance... or dance again!</p>

<h3>What is TheDeplorables.TV</h3>
<p>“The Deplorables TV” is a web series focusing on the lives of the so-called “Deplorables” in our great country and is dedicated to being the voice of common sense in America. While each episode highlights the life and perspective of different Deplorables, all of the episodes are intertwined and related. </p>
<p><i><strong>How can all the episodes featuring so many deplorables from different walks of life be related?</strong></i></p>
<p>I’m so glad you asked! Mainstream media, the Hollywood elite, and many on the left would have the world believe that Deplorables are the uneducated, toothless, living on welfare, gun toting buffoons of America. This show is going to let them know we’re anything but.</p>
<p>The Deplorables I know are hard working and chock full of common sense. We are patriotic. We are tough. ...So tough we don't have to get in gangs, cover our faces, break things, and attack people to get our points across.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Who am I? Who is helping me?</h3>
<p>My name is Tom Antion and I’m the producer of The Deplorables TV, Internet Expert, Consumer Advocate, and professional speaker. I’ve created hundreds of video and audio productions with the latest being <a href=""http://www.ScamBrigade.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.ScamBrigade.com</a> a consumer advocacy show that's currently being handled by a major Hollywood production company for sale to the networks.</p>
<p>You should also know that I’m not a fan of any particular politician because they all suck in their own way. I am fan of a prosperous and safe USA and through this show I plan on showcasing the real people ....the hard working deplorables, patriots and business people that elected businessman Donald Trump to shake up the status quo and get some real results while putting America First.</p>
<p>I’ve created and am producing The Deplorables TV because I'm sick and tired of snowflakes, safe spaces and political correctness ruining our country and generations of young people to come. ​</p>
<p>We have a team of hardworking, deplorable video people, research and social media people, and production people who, even though this is a labor of love, hope to get paid as the show takes off. That’s right, they are all volunteering to make this happen right now!</p>
<h3>The Format</h3>
<p>The first season of The Deplorables TV will be 6 episodes with each episodes being around 30 minutes. We plan to start shooting the web series in June 2017, and will be releasing the episodes on YouTube with the possibility of adding other streaming sites later.</p>
<p>Each episode would highlight 3-5 deplorables during the approximately 30 minute episode. Our anticipated release would be October 2017.</p>
<h3>Let's Talk About Money</h3>
<p>Now, about the money.<br/>I grew up frugal.</p>
<p>I know how to do things great, but cheap.</p>
<p>I've made full length, high quality TV and video shows for 1/10 th the cost of estimates from professional production companies.</p>
<p>I won't be blowing any of this money on lavish wasteful things.</p>
<p><i><strong>You contributions to The Deplorable TV will be used to:</strong></i></p>
<ul>
<li>Pay hardworking video production people</li>
<li>Pay Editing, research and security people</li>
<li>Contract out to deplorable Web and social media people</li>
<li>Cover travel expenses to highlight many, wonderful deplorables around this country</li>
<li>Acquire permits when necessary</li>
<li>Pay legal fees, taxes and the cost of being on this system</li>
</ul>

<p>Be sure to check out the perks on this page! Twitter shoutouts, shirts, show posters,DVD's, be featured in an episode and more! Take a look at all the perks, and email us if you have ideas for the show!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I’ve been an entrepreneur for my entire adult life and have an enormous track record of success. For The Deplorable TV web series, I currently have a team of hard working Deplorables volunteering behind the scenes to help make this show happen.</p>
<p>Our biggest challenge is that we could have to change the release date due to unforeseen circumstances. There could be outrageous attacks and protests from the left and/or the mainstream media. This could slow us down, but absolutely won't stop us.  </p>
<p>My goal, which is similar to what you may have heard from President Trump, I like to finish ahead of schedule and under budget. I need your help to get started and highlight the people just like you who are making America great again.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>A rural county in West Tennessee has become the hot spot for drug trafficking due to a smaller police presence with minimal resources. Upon the request of the District Attorney, a team of regional narcotics investigators are formed to battle the growing crisis plaguing the area.</p>
<p>The Stix peels back the layers to a complicated issue as we peek into the lives of the detectives pursuing the drug activity and the people in the midst of it.</p>
<p>This series will be free to view online via Youtube, Facebook or Vimeo. Unfortunately it's not free to make. This is an ambitious project with it's fair share of characters, challenges and locations. Our plan is to film this series throughout the summer and have it available for you by Fall 2018.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; Why</h3>
<p>$6000 is the bare minimum we need to complete this project comfortably. Here is a breakdown of how the money will be used...</p>
<ul>
<li>
<u>$1000 for Props &amp; wardrobe</u>. (Super soaker water guns and badges drawn on paper aren't as believable.)</li>
<li>
<u>$1000 for Locations &amp; Insurance.</u> Being a series, we need to lock in agreements on locations. Continuity is essential.</li>
<li>
<u>$2000 for key cast members.</u> We have an awesome cast of local up and coming talent. They are aware we won't get rich doing this but helping them with travel expenses and hopefully a day rate will go a long way.</li>
<li>
<u>$1000 for marketing</u>  We want people to see the hard work we put into this series.</li>
<li>
<u>$1000 for food</u>  Long days on set can work up an appetite. Feeding actors and crew is a necessity.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Why we need you</h3>
<p>Low budget projects present a challenge within itself because, well it's low budget. Some directors would consider $6000 an impossible amount to get a series off of the ground, but the director has a great track record of getting his films made with minimal resources.</p>
<p>As mentioned, $6000 is the absolute bare minimum we need to get this project off the ground but anything over that goal would make this series even better as we could</p>
<ul>
<li>Rent better equipment</li>
<li>Hire more crew help</li>
<li>Make the actors smile by adding a little more in their pockets.</li>
<li>Reach more people with marketing</li>
</ul>
</div><div>Check out our perks section, consider contributing and being apart of the team! Also you'll get some real cool stuff!</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute monetarily, we understand. But some things are just as good as cash.</p>
<ul>
<li>We need locations! If you're in the West Tennessee area and you have a location we could use, Awesome! We promise to respect any location as our own!</li>
<li>Have an old car you barely drive? Bring it to set, we can use it!</li>

I gots perks for ya.  Check 'em out in the PERKS section! ABOUT MEMy name is Ann Mahoney, you may know my work from THE WALKING DEAD (Olivia), SUN RECORDS (Gladys Presley), BAD MOMS (Mousey Mom), RECTIFY (Beth Mitcherson), and most recently SAME KIND OF DIFFERENT AS ME and LOGAN LUCKY.As a Christian (but not that judgmental, asshole kind), and an actress, I have grown increasingly frustrated with two aspects of the Hollywood television production machine: 1.  Faith-based shows that: don't speak to me as a Christian who believes the faith journey is not simple, don't show how tremendously hilarious God/Church/Church People are, don't question why we believe what we believe, and don't challenge us to be LESS judgmental of others... aka - MORE Christlike.2.  Television shows that only cast actresses over a size 2 as the ""frumpy teacher"" or the ""funny best friend.""  If they DO cast an actress who is, say, the size of the average American woman - size 14-16, she is the butt of the joke, she hates her body, and she is DEFINITELY NOT the love interest.I knew the only way to see the kind of show I want to SEE as a size 14-16 woman, who is a Christian, who wants to explore the craziness of faith and the humor of God - was to WRITE it.  SO... I did.  There I was sitting in a pew of my home church in Louisiana. I had just moved back to New Orleans after 6 years in Asheville, NC.  My husband and I moved there after Hurricane Katrina when our house was destroyed.  I had always heard people talk about the ""still small voice"" of God talking to you, and frankly, thought it was a load of bull.  But dang if I didn't hear that still, small voice that day.  And thus, PREACHIN TO THE CHOIR was born.  Yes, six years ago.  I have been refining the script ever since.With all the horrific stuff happening in Hollywood right now, I hear the same refrain over and over again - we need more WOMEN in Hollywood, more WOMAN-PRODUCED shows, more DIVERSITY in casting.  But I have to tell you, from my standpoint - it has been quite difficult to break into the upper echalon of powerful women in Hollywood... and I am ready to do just that with this show.  THAT is how you can help.What if you haven't got that spare $200 to give to the campaign but you are FOR all these things??  You can help by doing two things:  sharing this campaign, and praying.  If you believe in string theory, which this Physics lovin' Christian does, you know that prayer WORKS.THANK YOU for your SUPPORT!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello there! Do you love animation/horror/teen angst? Probably, if you clicked on this page. This is Offspring, a 2D series I want to make into a TV show. Who am I? I'm Hannah, creator/director/writer/editor of the whole shebang! An avid fan of horror comedies, I thought to myself one day, ""Wouldn't it be funny if a Slasher with a meat cleaver for a weapon had a son and his weapon was a butter knife?"" and thus, Offspring was born. </p>
<p>Do you remember watching something scary as a kid, and it left you a tiny bit traumatized, but also a little braver? That's my vision for this series. Fans of <i>Danny Phantom</i>, <i>Gravity Falls</i>, and <i>Invader Zim</i>, I want to give you that same feeling of shock, passion, and fan-girl fervor that rivals Tumblr circa 2012. (Yes, that serious.) Why do this, you may ask? Because creating this show has been the best experience of my life, and it was just getting those goofy fantasies from when I was an angsty pre-teen out of my head. I want this show to inspire the next generation  of people like me: the horror nerds, the sci-fi geeks, and the cringey romance lovers. </p>
<h3>Meet Our Team</h3>
<p>Our team is made up of talented creative professionals with years of experience in animation and artistry. Read their bios and get to know them a little!</p>
<p>Hannah Silverman (She/Her)<br/>Creator, Director, Writer, Editor<br/>Currently working as a Staff Writer, she earned a BA in Creative Writing with a Double Minor in French and Film/Media Studies at the University of Kansas. She is earning her MFA in Dramatic Writing at Savannah College of Art and Design and is expected to graduate May 2021. Hannah loves creating new worlds and writing dialogue. (@HannahSilverm19)</p>
<p>Sol Valdez (They/Them)<br/>Art Director, Character Designer, Storyboard Artist, &amp; Animator<br/>Former storyboard artist at CinemaChef Productions and Kolrom Media, they have earned a BFA in Illustration with a concentration in Sequential Art from the Maryland Institute College of Art. Sol currently works as a freelance visual development artist and loves exploring the intersections between design and storytelling. (@SolValdezArt)</p>
<p>Becca Katko (She/They) </p>
<p>Becca is a designer and story artist with a BFA in Illustration from the Maryland Institute College of Art. Action and humor are at the heart of her work, and she loves telling stories that pack a punch. (@beccakatko)</p>
<p>Danny Motta (He/Him)</p>
<p>Lead Voice Actor and Tiktok content creator. Danny has directed, acted in, and voice acted in several projects including short films and comedy sketches. He has a Cinema and Photography Bachelor’s Degree and is currently working as a freelance videographer/photographer. (@dmotta3)</p>
<p>And so many more! Follow us on social media and see our exciting new content for Offspring.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Right now, we're in the beginning stage. The project currently stands as a two minute animatic of the pilot's teaser. Our mission is to make sure everyone who helps with this project (animators, voice actors, sound designers) are paid for their time and work. Any funds we make, under or over our goal, goes to giving these people a well deserved paycheck.</p>
<p>Our budget is broken down into four categories: Art, Sound, Voice Acting, and Promotion. Animators will cover art direction, Sound Designers will create an audio environment that matches the scenes, and Voice Actors will bring our characters to life for your viewing pleasure. Future promotion of this show will allow us to continue building this immersive story.</p>
<p>We do have stretch goals planned out, which include:</p>
<p>1. A two minute teaser animatic with voice acting and sound design, as well as a short intro with graphics/music</p>
<p>2. A fully animated two minute teaser and intro, colored/polished, full sound, all that jazz</p>
<p>3. A fully animated twenty-two minute episode of the series pilot</p>
<p>Basically, the more money we earn, the more Offspring you'll get to see!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Here's the main reason why you should contribute: a series like Offspring created during the current animation Renaissance is going to foster a new love for comedy, horror, and young adult media. If you ever wished you could have been there at the start of <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender </i>or <i>Infinity Train, </i>this is your chance.</p>
<p>Experience-wise, I've got multiple degrees in Creative Writing (plus a double minor in French and Film/Media Studies) all with a concentration in animation screenwriting. I've been a coverage intern, a freelance writer, orchestrated multiple filmmaker interviews, and online script readings. I'm a part of this community, I know what goes on in it and most of all, I know what people want to see.</p>
<h3>Risk and Obstacles</h3>
</div><div>
<p>This is the first time I've undertaken a project like this, but I'm not going to let the idea of failure scare me or my team out of creating this series. We want to take every problem as they come and work together to find the solution. We've specifically allocated our budget for emergencies, because we know about the risk involved, just like every creator on this site.</p>
<p>Our team is loyal to my vision, and I want to compensate that loyalty with funds that cover their hourly rates and effort put into this project. If we do not reach our goal, Offspring will not be able to grow as a series. Our creative team includes LGBTQ+ folks, POC's, and professionally trained artists. Everyone working on Offspring has a full time job of their own,  and they're willing to make room for because they know it has potential.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're loving the sound of this, but still can't contribute financially, don't worry! There are still plenty of ways to support Offspring. We have a Facebook page, Twitter, and Instagram that we update regularly with exclusive new content. </p>
<p>Tell everyone about it! Tell your friends, your family, your enemies, strangers walking on the street, your UberEats driver that always gives you extra ketchup packets. Get out there and spread the word! </p>

BWF will shop its programming for licensing to a whole host of possible platforms, including major brands and retailers like Target, Best Buy and others to drive customers/viewers directly to their website to watch exclusive entertainment. We call this Retail Streaming Video on Demand (RSVOD). Our thinking is, why should a brand spend $200 million in advertising begging viewers via ads to come to their e-commerce or brick and mortar stores? Why don’t they have their own shows and have viewers watch them directly on their website? Then they can show them products that relate specifically to that demographic watching.

To be clear, we are not talking branded content or product placement. We are talking real entertainment like you’d see on other SVOD platforms.Do you have a concept for an original episodic series that speaks to a particular audience? Contact us here and we'll let you know if we think it's something we'd be interested in.Steve Weiss, Creative Director - BWF",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

The team is managed by Major Theodore Graham, an old army officer who was brought out of retirement to run this elite team. 
Each episode will follow Mary as she goes on a mission. It's fun, silly, ridiculous and sure to have you rolling with laughter. 

What We Need & What You Get
Nun the Wiser is a digital series, and we're trying to produce the first two episodes.
To do this we need:

Costumes
Sets
Props
Locations
Food for the cast and crew
Post-Production costs

Your contributions would be instrumental in securing all these items. 
But wait, there's more - PERKS!
Even $5 would make a huge impact in bringing this project together and to ensure you know how much we appreciate your help we have some fun perks for our backers. To the right side of the page you can see our fun perks.
 

The Team

Emily Keene - Writer, Director, Producer.
Originally from Melbourne, Australia, Emily has always had a love of silly comedy. Beginning as a director and designer for Theatre in Melbourne, Emily graduated from Monash University with a Bachelor of Arts in Film Studies in 2014, and realized that film and television was where her heart really lay. Moving to Los Angeles in 2015, to study Writing and Producing for Television at Loyola Marymount University, Emily has expanded her love of comedy. She's excited to direct and produce this fun show and hopes that you will share her passion for this crazy comedy. 
Andrew Gioia - Director of Photography.

Andrew Gioia is a current graduate student in the Film & TV Production program at Loyola Marymount University. He completed his undergraduate degrees at the University of Florida where he double majored in Telecommunications in Production and Finance. There, he worked for Gainesville's local news channel, WUFT, and with the ESPN and SEC production crews for live broadcasting of select sporting events. Prior to moving to LA, he interned for Business Insider as a video producer in NYC. Despite his eclectic past, Andrew's passion resides in creating anything in the realm of comedy. 

The Cast
Mikki Hernandez - Sister Mary Danger

Mikki, a California native, is a fresh face to the acting world. She has spent the last three years building a repertoire in acting for film/tv, voiceover, theater, combat fighting, improv and recently began exploring the art of sketch comedy. Her acting credits include short films Hexit and 62 Million; feature film The Night I Died; web series Shades and Layers; ID Network’s The Coroner; and most recently performed in the play Farragut North by Beau Willimon. She is a proud UCLA alum and enjoys traveling, dancing, and keeping up with meme culture.
Christopher Hazlehurst - Major Theodore Graham

Christopher grew up in a small town in Northern California and ended up moving to New York to be a lawyer.  After a few years of practicing law, he realized it was not the life for him; he quit his job and left the country for awhile.  After some very serious soul-searching, he decided to ditch the stable life and pursue his true passion as an actor.  He moved to LA and has been at it ever since.
Shane JP Monaghan - Mr. Johnson/ Samuel Inferno

Shane JP Monaghan is from San Diego, CA. He started acting his freshman year of high school and has continued to act ever since. He went to Grossmont Community College in San Diego and completed his Associates in Arts with a Theatre degree with an Acting emphasis. He then transferred to CSU, Long Beach where he completed his Bachelor of Arts with a Theatre Degree in the Performance Emphasis.  He has been very fortunate to start this journey with this cast and crew!  A couple of his recent theatre credits include The Good Boys and True (CSULB) and Elements (CSULB) . 
Tristan Biber - Skyler Garden/ Dr. Von Bulow

Tristan Biber was born and raised in Geneva, Switzerland and has somehow found his way to Los Angeles. He completed his undergrad education at Kenyon College in Ohio, where he studied Film and Anthropology. During his time at Kenyon, he performed in several productions, playing Chris Keller in All My Sons, Hank in Marvin's Room, and Mac in You Got Older. He has also performed in the Fringe NYC as Samuel in You Belong With Me Because You're So Vain. While he has been in LA, Tristan has worked on several short films, portraying Liam in Speak No Evil and Dave in A Big Missed Steak. He is truly honored to be part of the cast of Nun the Wiser, and is incredibly thankful to all those involved and those who have supported him along the way.

<p>My name is Ali Karim.  I am an American internal medicine doctor from Washington DC.  A little over one year ago, I began feeling left unsatisfied by the impact I was having on my patients.  For months, I wrapped my mind around finding better ways to help humanity on a bigger scale.  All the while, I’d look around only to witness more violence, more hatred, more illnesses, and more discrimination.  Enough was enough.  I had to do something.  </p>
<p><strong>So, I quit my job to travel indefinitely around the world in search of humanity and figure out a grander way of world change.</strong></p>
<p>Working as a physician and volunteering around the world has been an enlightening period, as I’ve come to believe that people truly can change the world if we unite together.  In our modern day, the power of media is more influential than any other power available to us, as it can reach from one end of the earth to the other.  So, I’ve traded my car for a camera and my apartment for a backpack to capture life abroad and share it for all to see.</p>
<p>Throughout my journeys, I've captured the beauty that life has to offer, as well as the horrors that you weren't meant to know.</p>
<p>The diffusion of knowledge and ideas is our most powerful tool.  I wish to harness this tool for the greater good by bringing this series into the limelight, in order to display the lives of the voiceless people around the world and share the beauty of humanity to the general public.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I’ve linked-up with a production company in Washington DC to help me professionally produce, edit, and distribute my material for the masses.  But production isn’t cheap – and traveling on my own dime has left me with little money to cover all the expenses. </p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $50,000 to get the first several episodes of this series completed.  Each episode will feature a different country and will discuss the topics of humanity, culture, war, peace, prejudice, as well as a host of other political conversations and what we can do to create change. </p>
<p>100% of the funding will go towards the production of this series and will help pay our seasoned veteran television producer, our broadcast editor/owner of the production company, as well as his team of talented professionals.  It will also help pay for music licensing and rights, coloring the film, graphics work, audio mixing, legal and marketing fees, distribution and syndication.</p>
<p>Funding will also help us put the finishing touches on our North Korea episode, ""The Last Americans"" - to be submitted for film festival consideration in 2018.  You can watch the sneak peek here:</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm <strong>Heather Milam</strong> the creator and co-writer of ""She's Just Making it Up."" This new pilot (series) is especially dear to my heart. It is a mix of fact and fiction from a particularly painful season in life. You know, that moment when the BIG QUESTION of ""What on earth am I doing with my life?"" knocks you off your feet.  Some choose to ignore the question and suppress it. But some, like our heroine Addie, choose to act. That choice to act can be risky, vulnerable and at times even tragic. Yet despite the many failures and mistakes along the way opportunities always emerge allowing us to become stronger and braver individuals.</p>
<p>Help support our vision and make this show a cinematic reality.</p>
<p><u><b>THE TEAM</b></u></p>
<p><strong>Andie Botrell</strong> - <strong>WRITER/CO-CREATOR</strong> and overall gift of a talent. As cliche as it sounds, Andie is a true Artist. She is <u>always,</u> and I mean ALWAYS creating. Plays, books, short poems, paintings, musical compositions, screen plays, tv pilots. Seriously this woman never stops. And even amidst all that creation she maintains the ability to be an overall gem of a human being. If you don't know her stuff already... you should. Check out her web series Seek Help now <a href=""https://vimeo.com/212271607"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://vimeo.com/212271607</a>.</p>
<p><strong>T.C. De Witt</strong> - <strong>DIRECTOR</strong> and film guru.  T.C., like Andie, is the truest of true in the artistic sense. An actual cartoon artist, visual artist, actor, director, writer, is there anything this man can't do? T.C. has a generosity about him that is infectious. He knows how to run a set (drama free), and is one of the most genuine human beings I know. </p>
<p><strong>Abbey Cayanan</strong> - <strong>PRODUCER</strong> and foodie at heart! This woman is dynamic and I was lucky enough to snag her as a co-producer. Her film credits to date have been primarily within the corporate realm, but recently she rocked the creative arts world with her editorial debut. She can do it all from design, to casting, to editing and beyond.  She just gets it done! There have also been rumors about her writing a female driven war/combat story... so let's hope that happens soon. It's a fresh perspective we have yet to see on the big screen.</p>
<p><strong>Nicole Buckenmeyer - PRODUCER/CO-WRITER </strong>and a woman who just makes my heart happy. Nicole's whit astounds me and having her around makes life that much more humorous. She is a dynamic actress, writer, and puppy lover extraordinaire. She is committed to the core and has been a massive encouragement in getting this production moving and on it's feet. I'd keep an eye on this one.  She's going places!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our hope is to represent a variety of voices throughout this series and that begins with this pilot episode. We live in a world that demands we see <u>everything</u> in black and white whether it be religion, race, or politics. But life is more complex, more intricate than that. Recognizing the gray can often bring us to a place of empathy and compassion. This is Addie's journey and a story we feel has a place on the big screen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If you know me, you know I HATE asking for money. It dates as far back as grade school fundraisers.  However, I am giving it my best go and looping it in with the ever popular ""Birthday Month"". Strangely I feel no guilt about people gifting me things during my birthday month. So please, instead of buying me a drink for my birthday (assuming in fact you would do that), think about donating $10 or $15 to this project. It's a much better investment. Believe me!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>1.  Share our campaign posts and links with friends and family - especially if you know of any fine folks that like contributing to the arts.  We want to create as much buzz about this project as we can, so your help in spreading the word is essential.</p>
<p>2. If you know a production company that currently has liability/workman's comp insurance...  and would want to take on our little project,  it would save ALOT in costs. Here's to hoping :)</p>
<p>3. Location Connections: If you have a space (or know someone connected to a space) that we could film for little to no cost, that would help us immensely.  Here are some locations we need: College campus, gymnasium/dance studio, coffee shop, bar/club, classroom/theater, corporate office (ideally with cubicles), and a 1 bedroom apartment.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hi! I'm Heather Milam the creator and co-writer of ""She's Just Making it Up."" This new pilot (series) is especially dear to my heart. It is a mix of fact and fiction from a particularly painful season in life. You know, that moment when the BIG QUESTION of ""What on earth am I doing with my life?"" knocks you off your feet.  Some choose to ignore the question and suppress it. But some, like our heroine Addie, choose to act. That choice to act can be risky, vulnerable and at times even tragic. Yet despite the many failures and mistakes along the way opportunities always emerge allowing us to become stronger and braver individuals.
Help support our vision and make this show a cinematic reality.
THE TEAM
Andie Botrell - WRITER/CO-CREATOR and overall gift of a talent. As cliche as it sounds, Andie is a true Artist. She is always, and I mean ALWAYS creating. Plays, books, short poems, paintings, musical compositions, screen plays, tv pilots. Seriously this woman never stops. And even amidst all that creation she maintains the ability to be an overall gem of a human being. If you don't know her stuff already... you should. Check out her web series Seek Help now https://vimeo.com/212271607.
T.C. De Witt - DIRECTOR and film guru.  T.C., like Andie, is the truest of true in the artistic sense. An actual cartoon artist, visual artist, actor, director, writer, is there anything this man can't do? T.C. has a generosity about him that is infectious. He knows how to run a set (drama free), and is one of the most genuine human beings I know. 
Abbey Cayanan - PRODUCER and foodie at heart! This woman is dynamic and I was lucky enough to snag her as a co-producer. Her film credits to date have been primarily within the corporate realm, but recently she rocked the creative arts world with her editorial debut. She can do it all from design, to casting, to editing and beyond.  She just gets it done! There have also been rumors about her writing a female driven war/combat story... so let's hope that happens soon. It's a fresh perspective we have yet to see on the big screen.
Nicole Buckenmeyer - PRODUCER/CO-WRITER and a woman who just makes my heart happy. Nicole's whit astounds me and having her around makes life that much more humorous. She is a dynamic actress, writer, and puppy lover extraordinaire. She is committed to the core and has been a massive encouragement in getting this production moving and on it's feet. I'd keep an eye on this one.  She's going places!

What We Need & What You Get
Filming in LA ain't cheap - especially if you choose to do a SAG project. So, all support will go to the following.
$3000 – Insurance (Liability & Workers Comp) & Permits
$1250 – Food for Cast & Crew
               Breakfast/lunch/dinner for 5-day shoot
               10-30 people on set per day
$2000 – Locations & Additional Equipment
               Locations include: College campus, coffee shop, bar, etc... 
               Additional lighting/sound/camera equipment that isn’t already donated
$2000 – Editing/Color Correction
               This is a must have – as we want to complete the project and have it
               looking as professional as possible
$1750 – Misc. Expenses
   Costumes, parking, gas, travel (for some crew/cast), and much much more.
Note:  any extra or remaining funds raised will go directly to pay Crew and Cast members (at this point everyone will be working for free). No person will be profiting from this fundraising campaign in any way.

<p><strong><i>Earth-Link Origins</i></strong> is an <strong>animated sci-fi web series </strong>that tells a <strong>huge story </strong>featuring an<strong> ensemble cast</strong>. If you were to cross <strong><i>Star Trek</i></strong> and <strong><i>Star Wars</i></strong> with aspects of <strong><i>Dragon Ball Z</i></strong> and the classic video games <strong><i>Colony Wars</i></strong> and <i><strong>Wing Commander</strong>, </i>you would get <i><strong>Earth-Link Origins</strong> -- </i>a series set in a <strong>huge universe </strong>with <strong>unforgettable characters</strong>, <strong>rich lore</strong>, and <strong>an ambitious story about friendship, conspiracy, betrayal, romance, heartbreak, and the power of faith</strong>.</p>

<p>The series is set <strong>2,000 years into the future</strong> and <strong>tells the story about two warring factions</strong>, the <strong>benevolent Earth Empire</strong> and the <strong>vicious Morningstar Pirates</strong>, and how <strong>their conflict ultimately leads to an event</strong> that <strong>changes the face of the entire galaxy</strong>. The <strong>overall story</strong> will be <strong>told from both sides of the war: </strong>on the side of the <strong>Earth Empire, </strong>we chronicle the adventures of <strong>several characters</strong> including <strong>Commander Zero</strong>, <strong>Lieutenant Commander Rose</strong>, <strong>Lieutenants Aiden</strong> and <strong>Meatbag</strong>, and pilot <strong>Colonel Catscratch, </strong>and <strong>how these five characters come together</strong> to <strong>overcome incredible odds</strong>; on the side of the <strong>Morningstar Pirates, </strong>we get an up-close-and-personal view of their leader, <strong>Jupiter the Unstoppable, </strong>his friend <strong>Ganymede the Ambitious, </strong>and his new ally, the mysterious <strong>Endymion, </strong>and how they plan to <strong>overthrow and destroy the Earth Empire </strong>-- and their reasons for doing so.</p>

<p><strong><i>Earth-Link Origins</i></strong> was originally conceived back in 2009 by <strong>Chris Kroznuski</strong> and <strong>Chris Cameron.</strong> After<strong> almost 10 years</strong> of <strong>fine-tuning</strong> the <strong>story, ideas, </strong>and <strong>visual style</strong>, <strong>Kroznuski</strong> is producing and directing a <strong>20 minute pilot episode</strong> to <strong>""light the fuse""</strong> for <strong>production of the</strong> <strong>full series</strong>. We are looking to <strong>IndieGoGo donors</strong>, <strong>fans of indie sci-fi, fans of </strong><strong>indie animation</strong>, and of course,<strong> anyone else who just wants to see this project succeed,</strong> to raise a minimum goal of about <strong>$4,500</strong> to<strong> help us see this project through</strong> with <strong>the best quality we can manage</strong><strong> -- and purchase gear that we can use for the rest of the series run!</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned before, our <strong>Prologue </strong>is set to only be <strong>20 minutes long; however, depending on whether we meet certain stretch goals</strong> (see below), we may be able to fund <strong>one or even several 60-to-75-minute Episodes/Acts. </strong>As the <strong>Prologue </strong>is finished, our next goal will be to <strong>finish</strong> <strong>Act I, </strong>which will pick up immediately after the <strong>Prologue </strong>is finished (<strong>Act I combines</strong> the <strong>Prologue plus the next 40 minutes we plan to create</strong>).</p>

<p><strong>$4,500</strong> is our <strong>absolute, bare-bones minimum goal</strong>, however we do have <strong>several stretch goals</strong> in the event that this campaign becomes popular enough:</p>

<p>You may be asking, <b>why are our stretch goals set up this way? </b>The answer is because <strong>in producing the Prologue, more than half of the digital assets needed for the entire series have been produced.</strong> However, we still need to <strong>pay for our artists, our actors, our musicians, and all mediums of promotion </strong>throughout the rest of the series run.</p>
</div><div>
<h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1514554917/yiysg8mupevgkvgokxi8.jpg"" src=""""/></h2>
<p>As we stated before, our <strong>absolute,</strong> <strong>bare-bones minimum goal </strong>is <b>$4,500 USD.</b> This money will help us purchase <strong>motion capture systems </strong>including the <strong>Perception Neuron Full-Body MoCap Suite (approx. $1,500 USD) </strong>and the <strong>Faceware Facial MoCap Plugin </strong>for <strong>Reallusion iClone (approx. $1300 USD). </strong>That's <strong>$2,800 USD total </strong>for both hardware and software.</p>
<p>We know what you're thinking: <strong>why set a minimum goal of $4,500 if you only need $2,800?</strong> There are <strong>several reasons</strong> for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>IndieGoGo campaigns </strong>-- <strong>and by extension other crowdfunding sites</strong>-- usually take out about <strong>10% of all sum total donations -- </strong>this includes a <strong>5% fee</strong> that <strong>goes directly to IndieGoGo, </strong>where <strong>the other 5% </strong>involves <strong>per-transaction processing, international money conversion,</strong> and,<strong> depending on your currency and location, additional wire fees. </strong>This is extrapolated as per<strong> IndieGoGo's <a href=""https://learn.indiegogo.com/pricing-and-fees/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Pricing and Fees Page</a>.</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Most crowdfunding campaigns</strong> have a <strong>dropout rate of approximately 10% -- </strong>in other words, <strong>about 10% of people that contribute either drop out or lower their donation amount</strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Another 10%</strong> will go towards <strong>perk fulfillment, including shipping and handling of physical perks </strong>and <strong>processing of digital perks.</strong>
</li>
<li>Finally, in running this crowdfunding campaign, we want to help others as well; to this end,<strong> 10% of what we make off of this campaign</strong> will be <strong>split between and donated to three different charities:</strong> <strong><a href=""https://haveagayday.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Have a Gay Day</a>, </strong><strong><a href=""http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Doctors Without Borders</a>, </strong>and <a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/steve-and-kennys-house-fire"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>a small fundraiser for a local friend who lost his home back in December</strong></a>. <strong>Help us, help them!</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In donating to us,</strong> you will be <strong>giving us the opportunity</strong> to create <strong>a sci-fi series of epic proportions, </strong>filled with <strong>dazzling visuals, </strong><strong>a huge story, </strong>and <strong>a universe with the potential to expand far beyond its limits.</strong> Also, <strong>you'll get a little something from us</strong> in exchange for your donation!</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Here is a list of perks we have to offer for this campaign. Some are <strong>physical,</strong> some are <strong>digital,</strong> but they all have one thing in common: <strong>whatever you donate, you will get something in return, and we don't just mean our eternal gratitude. </strong>Have a look!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516177812/j3csxnlipvfnexqvqlg4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>In the event</strong> that we manage to make <strong>ANY </strong>of our <strong>Stretch Goals, these perks will be modified and upgraded accordingly; </strong>for example, <strong>if we make Stretch Goal #1, all donors who donate at the LIEUTENANT Level will AUTOMATICALLY receive a digital download of the Prologue, Act I, and both the Prologue AND the Act I Original Score!</strong></p>
<p><strong>All physical perks</strong> in this campaign will be shipped out <strong>within one month of release </strong>of the Prologue.</p>
<p><strong>If you are an investor </strong>and want to donate more than what is listed on our perk chart, <strong>please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Three things:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Any money we receive <strong>will be saved and go towards purchasing the gear in the future</strong>, and <strong>we will still donate 10% of whatever we make</strong> to the three charities mentioned above.</li>
<li>
<strong>All donors who donated will still receive their perks,</strong> though it may take some extra time to ship them out.</li>

<p><strong><i>Earth-Link Origins </i></strong>promises to be a series that <strong>pushes forward with leaps and bounds </strong>in its <strong>visual style, storytelling,</strong> and <strong>characters </strong>by <strong>blurring the lines between science fiction and science fantasy</strong>, creating <strong>huge,</strong> <strong>powerful, overarching story arcs</strong>, and <strong>using beautifully rendered CGI to tell its story.</strong> By helping us invest in <strong><i>Earth-Link Origins, </i></strong>you will be helping us <strong>nurture a sci-fi/sci-fantasy universe </strong>that is set to <strong>continue</strong> <strong>for years to come. </strong>Have we mentioned that we've been working on this project for <strong>almost a decade?</strong></p>

Poster designed by Michael Wiley.

 

Earth-Link Origins is an animated sci-fi web series that tells a huge story featuring an ensemble cast. If you were to cross Star Trek and Star Wars with aspects of Dragon Ball Z and the classic video games Colony Wars and Wing Commander, you would get Earth-Link Origins -- a series set in a huge universe with unforgettable characters, rich lore, and an ambitious story about friendship, conspiracy, betrayal, romance, heartbreak, and the power of faith.
 

The series is set 2,000 years into the future and tells the story about two warring factions, the benevolent Earth Empire and the vicious Morningstar Pirates, and how their conflict ultimately leads to an event that changes the face of the entire galaxy. The overall story will be told from both sides of the war: on the side of the Earth Empire, we chronicle the adventures of several characters including Commander Zero, Lieutenant Commander Rose, Lieutenants Aiden and Meatbag, and pilot Colonel Catscratch, and how these five characters come together to overcome incredible odds; on the side of the Morningstar Pirates, we get an up-close-and-personal view of their leader, Jupiter the Unstoppable, his friend Ganymede the Ambitious, and his new ally, the mysterious Endymion, and how they plan to overthrow and destroy the Earth Empire -- and their reasons for doing so.
 









 

Earth-Link Origins was originally conceived back in 2009 by Chris Kroznuski and Chris Cameron. After almost 10 years of fine-tuning the story, ideas, and visual style, Kroznuski is producing and directing a 20 minute pilot episode to ""light the fuse"" for production of the full series. We are looking to IndieGoGo donors, fans of indie sci-fi, fans of indie animation, and of course, anyone else who just wants to see this project succeed, to raise a minimum goal of about $4,500 to help us see this project through with the best quality we can manage -- and purchase gear that we can use for the rest of the series run!
As mentioned before, our Prologue is set to only be 20 minutes long; however, depending on whether we meet certain stretch goals (see below), we may be able to fund one or even several 60-to-75-minute Episodes/Acts. As the Prologue is finished, our next goal will be to finish Act I, which will pick up immediately after the Prologue is finished (Act I combines the Prologue plus the next 40 minutes we plan to create).
 

We are a small production team consisting of both new and veteran talent in regards to both actors and artists; many of our cast and crew hail from science fiction fan and indie productions.
Our cast of actors includes:




Tim Torre (Star Wars: Revan, EOS 10) - Commander Zero

Ashley M. Kalfas (Star Trek: The Romulan War, The Lone Ranger) - Lieutenant Commander Rose

Chris Beckman (The Sandwich) - Lieutenant Aiden

Clint Bracey (Star Trek: Red Squad) - Lieutenant Meatbag

Brandon Rainsford (Naruto: The Abridged Series, Go Go Parody Rangers) - Colonel Catscratch

Tom Gore (Knob Goblins, Doctor Who: The Ginger Chronicles) - Admiral Maverick

Grant Patrizio (Party of Sin, Smackdown) - Councilor Dascar

Robert S. Benjamin (Wing Commander Saga, Final Melody) - Jupiter The Unstoppable

Greg Arnold (War Tech Fighters, A Desperate Mother's Love) - Endymion

Alex LaFreniere (Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, No Exit) - Ganymede The Ambitious

Keaira Kusanagi (Renegades) - Kore The Swift

Cassidy Rose Munley (Oliver!, Shrek: The Musical) - Miranda The Elusive

Our creative team includes:


Sean Tourangeau (Axanar, Star Trek: Titan) - Concept Artist and Designer

Tristan Cameron - Concept Artist and Designer

Gabriel Koerner (The Orville, Firefly, Battlestar Galactica) - Visual Effects Artist

Michael Wiley (Star Trek: Ships of the Line) - Visual Effects Artist

Hayden Aeries (Stage 9) - Visual Effects Artist

David Metlesits - Visual Effects Artist

Ali Ries (BSG: Blood and Chrome, Renegades) - Visual Effects Artist

Matt Haslam - Audio Engineer

Julia Saltflower - Additional Music

Aram Zero - Additional Music

Olivia Szlasa - Writer

Chris Cameron - Executive Producer

Chris Kroznuski (Project Potemkin, Starship Deimos) - Director, Producer, Writer, Visual Effects Artist, Composer

 

$4,500 is our absolute, bare-bones minimum goal, however we do have several stretch goals in the event that this campaign becomes popular enough:

Yes, you read that top one correctly -- in the event that we make anything past our 6th and Ultimate Stretch Goal over the first 30 days of this campaign, we will automatically donate all excess donations to three different charities (see below), in addition to what we already promise to donate. For example, if we make $35,000 in this campaign, we will donate 10% of the $30,000 we make on this campaign PLUS an additional $5,000 to our selected charities.
You may be asking, why are our stretch goals set up this way? The answer is because in producing the Prologue, more than half of the digital assets needed for the entire series have been produced. However, we still need to pay for our artists, our actors, our musicians, and all mediums of promotion throughout the rest of the series run.


As we stated before, our absolute, bare-bones minimum goal is $4,500 USD. This money will help us purchase motion capture systems including the Perception Neuron Full-Body MoCap Suite (approx. $1,500 USD) and the Faceware Facial MoCap Plugin for Reallusion iClone (approx. $1300 USD). That's $2,800 USD total for both hardware and software.
We know what you're thinking: why set a minimum goal of $4,500 if you only need $2,800? There are several reasons for this:


IndieGoGo campaigns -- and by extension other crowdfunding sites-- usually take out about 10% of all sum total donations -- this includes a 5% fee that goes directly to IndieGoGo, where the other 5% involves per-transaction processing, international money conversion, and, depending on your currency and location, additional wire fees. This is extrapolated as per IndieGoGo's Pricing and Fees Page.


Most crowdfunding campaigns have a dropout rate of approximately 10% -- in other words, about 10% of people that contribute either drop out or lower their donation amount.

Another 10% will go towards perk fulfillment, including shipping and handling of physical perks and processing of digital perks.

Finally, in running this crowdfunding campaign, we want to help others as well; to this end, 10% of what we make off of this campaign will be split between and donated to three different charities: Have a Gay Day, Doctors Without Borders, and a small fundraiser for a local friend who lost his home back in December. Help us, help them!


In donating to us, you will be giving us the opportunity to create a sci-fi series of epic proportions, filled with dazzling visuals, a huge story, and a universe with the potential to expand far beyond its limits. Also, you'll get a little something from us in exchange for your donation!
 

Here is a list of perks we have to offer for this campaign. Some are physical, some are digital, but they all have one thing in common: whatever you donate, you will get something in return, and we don't just mean our eternal gratitude. Have a look!

In the event that we manage to make ANY of our Stretch Goals, these perks will be modified and upgraded accordingly; for example, if we make Stretch Goal #1, all donors who donate at the LIEUTENANT Level will AUTOMATICALLY receive a digital download of the Prologue, Act I, and both the Prologue AND the Act I Original Score!
All physical perks in this campaign will be shipped out within one month of release of the Prologue.
If you are an investor and want to donate more than what is listed on our perk chart, please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly!
 

Three things:

Any money we receive will be saved and go towards purchasing the gear in the future, and we will still donate 10% of whatever we make to the three charities mentioned above.

All donors who donated will still receive their perks, though it may take some extra time to ship them out.
Finally, we will do everything in our power to still release the Prologue as per our original release date of June.



 

Earth-Link Origins promises to be a series that pushes forward with leaps and bounds in its visual style, storytelling, and characters by blurring the lines between science fiction and science fantasy, creating huge, powerful, overarching story arcs, and using beautifully rendered CGI to tell its story. By helping us invest in Earth-Link Origins, you will be helping us nurture a sci-fi/sci-fantasy universe that is set to continue for years to come. Have we mentioned that we've been working on this project for almost a decade?

 

We are fully aware that by accepting your pledges, we are accepting a responsibility to our investors -- a responsibility to you. And thanks to the talents behind this project, we are set to deliver a quality product your way. That being said, in the event of unexpected delays, we will gladly notify you -- our investors -- in regards to what will be happening behind the scenes. In the face of unexpected obstacles, our team has risen to the challenge again and again -- and we can count on their endurance to continue doing so, so that we can deliver you the best film we can.

<p><strong>A little over a year ago, writer/creator Ellis stumbled back upon a collection of bright, upbeat blog posts she'd written during a contrastingly numb, depressive semester abroad.</strong> Healing from heartbreak and addressing mental illness had, at the time, felt incredibly isolating and lonely. But since opening up and in return hearing similar stories from truly resilient, sincere individuals, she realized the universality, optimism, and - what a concept! - <i>comedy</i> in the universal experience. Being a human is hard as hell, and hiding that reality on Instagram (or LinkedIn, or Tinder, or KinkedIn, a patent-pending hybrid devised by Yael, a character in<i>The Only Coffee Shop</i>'s characters) is even frickin' harder.</p>
<p>Ellis then wrote a thesis on millennial cynicism as a coping mechanism, along with exploring television format and style in theatre and vise versa, and now considers herself totally equipped to create contemporary meta-dramedic (drama + comedy) satire. Or at the least, she'll<i> </i>critique, defend, and analyze modern audiences and this generation until it's overtaken by the next one. </p>
<p><strong>We produced this piece originally as a stage play in December 2018</strong>. Rehearsals oscillated between improv comedy and emotional sharing sessions. Reception from the public was encouraging and affirmative. Many folks said something along the lines of: ""I wish this were a Netflix show, so I could watch it whenever I need it.""  </p>
<p>So that's what we're doing! Giving the people what they want and need. Love and laughter with this initially zero-budget limited series: high in caffeine, low in self-esteem, and ultimately maturing, empowering, and surreally real.</p>
<p><strong><i>The Only Coffee Shop in the City</i> is also making its NYC premiere October 2019 at the Hudson Guild Theatre as part of NY Theatre Fest. </strong></p>

<p>Here in our imaginative little metaphorical coffee shop, we see the potential in working together towards this common vision. We think it's honestly rare to find someone who cares about and/or is good at only one single thing, and artists and creators especially love experimenting with mediums and roles.</p>

<p>""I truly loved your play. I relate to it so much. I felt incredibly connected to the protagonist, be it in her awful cynical comments, her imagined scenes of conversations turning into jazz numbers, her dealings with grief, etc. I wish you could turn this into a movie so I could deliberately seek it out and watch it at my will when I need a good caricature of my life to reflect upon. God bless your artistry, seriously.""</p>
<p>""How beautiful and empowering and emotionally rich your play is. It’s been a few days and I’m still thinking about it. It was incredibly well done, the cast was impeccable and you are so so talented!"" ​</p>
<p>""I hope you'll keep me on your mailing list. I want to be there when you and your act go nationwide.""</p>
<p>""Very, very well constructed and cleverly written. You all have done a nice job."" ​</p>

A little over a year ago, writer/creator Ellis stumbled back upon a collection of bright, upbeat blog posts she'd written during a contrastingly numb, depressive semester abroad. Healing from heartbreak and addressing mental illness had, at the time, felt incredibly isolating and lonely. But since opening up and in return hearing similar stories from truly resilient, sincere individuals, she realized the universality, optimism, and - what a concept! - comedy in the universal experience. Being a human is hard as hell, and hiding that reality on Instagram (or LinkedIn, or Tinder, or KinkedIn, a patent-pending hybrid devised by Yael, a character inThe Only Coffee Shop's characters) is even frickin' harder.
Ellis then wrote a thesis on millennial cynicism as a coping mechanism, along with exploring television format and style in theatre and vise versa, and now considers herself totally equipped to create contemporary meta-dramedic (drama + comedy) satire. Or at the least, she'll critique, defend, and analyze modern audiences and this generation until it's overtaken by the next one. 
We produced this piece originally as a stage play in December 2018. Rehearsals oscillated between improv comedy and emotional sharing sessions. Reception from the public was encouraging and affirmative. Many folks said something along the lines of: ""I wish this were a Netflix show, so I could watch it whenever I need it.""  
So that's what we're doing! Giving the people what they want and need. Love and laughter with this initially zero-budget limited series: high in caffeine, low in self-esteem, and ultimately maturing, empowering, and surreally real.
The Only Coffee Shop in the City is also making its NYC premiere October 2019 at the Hudson Guild Theatre as part of NY Theatre Fest.

collaborative team of pals
Here in our imaginative little metaphorical coffee shop, we see the potential in working together towards this common vision. We think it's honestly rare to find someone who cares about and/or is good at only one single thing, and artists and creators especially love experimenting with mediums and roles.
So this is kinda an all hands on deck operation! Everyone offers a range of skills and thoughts across the board.

Written reviews from various students, professors, audience members:
""A tome/poem to the writing gods, and I enjoyed every minute of it! These unique and extraordinary characters as they process their unique and extraordinary lives. This is tremendous work. Truly.""
""I truly loved your play. I relate to it so much. I felt incredibly connected to the protagonist, be it in her awful cynical comments, her imagined scenes of conversations turning into jazz numbers, her dealings with grief, etc. I wish you could turn this into a movie so I could deliberately seek it out and watch it at my will when I need a good caricature of my life to reflect upon. God bless your artistry, seriously.""
""How beautiful and empowering and emotionally rich your play is. It’s been a few days and I’m still thinking about it. It was incredibly well done, the cast was impeccable and you are so so talented!"" ​
""I hope you'll keep me on your mailing list. I want to be there when you and your act go nationwide.""
""Very, very well constructed and cleverly written. You all have done a nice job."" ​
""Refreshingly honest conversations involving mental health, independence, relationships, and grieving in a society dominated by social media dominate. Realistic characters that portray the awkwardness experienced in everyday life. Even the side characters show depth and affect the plot in surprising ways."" - Onward State article

<p>You ever believe in something so much that no matter what anyone else said you just knew it was the thing you needed to be doing? Ever believe it so much that you continued to fight for it no matter how hard it was to obtain? Have you ever lost sleep over it, sacrificed for it, and even in your failure continued to long for it and press towards it? If you can identify with any of those then you know exactly what this project is and what it is about. Its about <strong>HOPE. </strong>Through these stories told we hope to engage your humanity, bridge divides, and bring about an understanding through the drama and conflict each character experiences.</p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/5wJGLqEjqjY?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div> We are here to prove to ourselves and others that anything is possible when you believe in yourself ANYTHING!!! A message that needs to be heard!<p></p>
<p>We've been here before on this platform and though our purpose has not changed the vehicle to achieve it has. ""<strong><i>LAWLESS</i></strong> "" is an original television series which speaks to the various issues effecting us all and though it is expressed through the lives of fictional characters the underlying purpose is to fulfill a lifelong dream that is not just my own but the collective dreams of all who make this show what it is and will be, our cast our crew... and most importantly you our fans. </p>
<p>Ever cheer for the underdog ever see a competitor just grateful to finish the race before them? This show is comprised of those who believed that what they had was all there was and though content there is nothing wrong with desiring more out of life.  We all have strived to experience the very best that life can yield and if given the opportunity wouldn't you seize it? This cast like so many before us have been told<i> ""that's a silly dream""</i> or ""<i>c'mon isn't it a little late for that in your life""</i> and don't we all love this one<i> ""so your going to be a star huh... yea right"". </i>The fact of the matter is no dream that burns within is silly , its never to late in life to pursue your passion, and each and everyone of us is a star in our own right because we are all different and still yet the same. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Film and entertainment as it were has left Florida for the most part. Many people worked on projects like <i>""Miami Vice"" ""Burn Notice"" ""Ballers""</i> 2 of these shows had a great run provided many with their big break but now the industry has left due to the lack of incentives but there still remains those among us who would like to explore opportunities and we believe<strong> we should create our own.</strong> There are students in our local schools taking drama, tv production, graphic arts design, computer graphics once they have graduated what then? This show could be the beginning of many more opportunities to come and it starts with you and this campaign. There is an old saying ""its always impossible until someone does it"" and with your help and support WE CAN DO IT!!! How would it feel to know you're responsible for launching someone's career? That my friend is impact and that is priceless.  </p>

From Executive Producer Ray Murphy Jr. ""Another 48 Hours"" ""Harlem Nights"" ""Coming to America"" featuring Tonea Stewart ""Mississippi Burning"" ""A Time to Kill"" ""Girls Trip"" and Kymani Marley ""One Love"" ""Money Talks"" ""Shottas"" comes this hard hitting episodic series entitles ""LAWLESS"". Betrayed by the very thing he was sworn to uphold a former officer turned operative delivers with blind vengeance a brand of justice that shakes the foundation of organized crime and all who would profit from it.

You ever believe in something so much that no matter what anyone else said you just knew it was the thing you needed to be doing? Ever believe it so much that you continued to fight for it no matter how hard it was to obtain? Have you ever lost sleep over it, sacrificed for it, and even in your failure continued to long for it and press towards it? If you can identify with any of those then you know exactly what this project is and what it is about. Its about HOPE. Through these stories told we hope to engage your humanity, bridge divides, and bring about an understanding through the drama and conflict each character experiences. We are here to prove to ourselves and others that anything is possible when you believe in yourself ANYTHING!!! A message that needs to be heard!
We've been here before on this platform and though our purpose has not changed the vehicle to achieve it has. ""LAWLESS "" is an original television series which speaks to the various issues effecting us all and though it is expressed through the lives of fictional characters the underlying purpose is to fulfill a lifelong dream that is not just my own but the collective dreams of all who make this show what it is and will be, our cast our crew... and most importantly you our fans. 
Ever cheer for the underdog ever see a competitor just grateful to finish the race before them? This show is comprised of those who believed that what they had was all there was and though content there is nothing wrong with desiring more out of life.  We all have strived to experience the very best that life can yield and if given the opportunity wouldn't you seize it? This cast like so many before us have been told ""that's a silly dream"" or ""c'mon isn't it a little late for that in your life"" and don't we all love this one ""so your going to be a star huh... yea right"". The fact of the matter is no dream that burns within is silly , its never to late in life to pursue your passion, and each and everyone of us is a star in our own right because we are all different and still yet the same. 

We need your help to prove it not just to the world but to all those who would look to us for an example.  Can we count on you? 

What We Need & What You Get
Our goal is to raise 15,000.00

""LAWLESS"" is a dark detective drama think ""The Blacklist"" meets ""The Equalizer"" and a bit of ""Leverage"" thrown in for seasoning and as such the show is action intense. All funds raised will be used to provide the production value needed to make the show what it needs to be successful.
Props, special effects, makeup, wardrobe multiple camera shooting, editing and post production are just an example of some of the costs we'll incur and don't want to deliver a show that disappoints.

<p>My name is Chiffon Valentine, an independent producer that lives and works in Los Angeles, but, I am a proud native of Virginia. So proud that I am taking my first venture into scripted television back home this summer to shoot a pilot under my independent company, Naturally Red Productions LLC. A major component to a town’s culture is the art that is reflected within it and local artists have always enriched their communities as their art reflects that area’s history and roots. So to be able to spotlight these unique facets of American creativity is a task worth undertaking and supporting. Independent art forms are constantly on the rise and often times without a big Hollywood studio behind it, the artists have the ability to contain the creative control. On the flip side, the financial backing is never on the same scale. For independent producers, we count on the generosity of local businesses, family/friends and sometimes even strangers to help tell our stories. That is why we are coming to you. Partnering with our vision would provide prestige in the independent and potential television programming world, as well as a helping those outside of the ""hollywood"" bubble get their chance to shine! </p>

<p>After Hours is a pilot/ proof of concept for a series about a woman who examines the unconscious choices she made which led to her cheating on her husband.</p>
<p>The project explores the boundaries of relationships, and how a seemingly innocent interaction can quickly spiral out of control.</p>
<p>For this project we are asking for $9,500. This money will go toward equipment rentals, securing locations, feeding our amazing cast and crew, as well as paying for festival fees upon completion.</p>
<p>In exchange for your support you can get anything from a personalized shout out on social media, to a producer credit (if you have the big bucks). We also have After Hours merchandise, and passes to see the finished product later this year.</p>
<p>This project is important, because I wanted to explore how relationships are tested when gender roles are reversed.</p>
<p>We all know the cliche of a husband trading up his wife for his hot young secretary.</p>
<p>With After Hours, we’re flipping that narrative, and documenting the very real consequences of Michelle’s (our main character) actions.</p>
<p>Any contribution help, from $1 to the entire $9500. However, if you cannot contribute financially then please please please find us on Facebook @afterhoursatl and on Instagram @after_hours_series. Like and share our posts, and get the word out!</p>

We want to build a solid, consistent team and not make them have to choose between a higher paying job on another film project and Cavendish if they don't want to.Be an alumnus of Cavendish in three ways
Join as a backer, which means you also get perks in exchange for the level of financial support you give. Perks range from signed scripts, photos from the set on a postcard sent to your front door, official portraits taken by our photographer on location of actors in character, social media shoutouts, Cavendish apparel and merchandise and a chance to visit us on set or have a video call from us!
If the 'fuss' or the perks aren't for you, you can support Cavendish through Indiegogo via the 'contribution' button.
Watch the show, and if you like us, share our links or talk about us. If we're not your cup of tea that's okay too.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Sinners Haven - a TV show you haven't experienced before!</h3>
<p>The story follows <strong>Christian </strong>who begins working at <strong>Sinners Haven</strong>, a popular East London gay bar, and we quickly learn that he’s not like the other Sinners; <strong>Aaron</strong>, <strong>Max</strong>, <strong>Tom</strong> and <strong>Rachel</strong>. However, one thing that everyone has in common is that they’re all hiding their own <strong>deadly secrets</strong>. Especially the bar’s owner, <strong>Peter Parish</strong>.</p>

With her best friend Kasey, gay spirit guide Julia and not-so-secret crush Alex, the semester is filled with mischievous plans, shocking revelations, some heart break, and self-discoveries.</p>
<p>Posterity was the brain child of a tough first year at university (also doesn't help that that year was 2016) as well as hearing other people's struggles. It's about the realities of that daunting experience, but also perhaps there's good that can come out of it. It's about independence, self-discovery, friendship, relationships and perspectives.</p>
<div><p> </p></div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The broader purpose of Posterity, is to firstly show people that they are not alone - either in the starting university/new scary chapter of your life struggle, finding who you are struggle or questioning your sexuality/coming out struggle. </p>
<p>Further, specifically, Posterity was written as a direct response to the lack of diversity (gender, sexuality, race) in media. The series wants, it whatever small way possible, to tip the scale back, and add one more to the tally of female characters, LGBTQ characters, and POC characters. </p>
<p>Also Posterity is written and directed by Anna Yuen (view my lovely face below), a gay woman of colour, so in real life representation, my dudes. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h3>Format</h3>
<p>Posterity will be released in real time, in Australia's semester one 2017. (Late Feb-early June 2017) There will be 26 episodes in total, with two episodes released per week, and maybe even some bonus videos.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Moneys and Perks</h3>
<p>We need funding for props and set design to make the series look as real as possible, equipment to improve the quality of image and sound (lights, mics, sound recorders, SD cards, and also cases to transport these to location (it's surprising how much those cost)), and for crafts to feed our wonderful actors so they can do what they do best. At the moment our cast and crew are working for free (with some travelling from quite a distance away), so your contribution shows us how much you value our work, storytelling, filmmaking and the arts.</p>
<p>There's all sorts of awesome perks available including behind the scenes and blooper extras, the original storyboard (hard drawn, or more like scrawled), original title art (also hand drawn, a lot prettier),  a Skype sesh or meet up (if in Sydney), nominating a tag/challenge video idea for us to do and an interview opportunity!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, the series will still be made, but we would be literal starving artists and the series would not look or sound as awesome as it can be. (Dodgy sound is not fun at all.)</p>

Consumed with regret from his past, our leading guy, Randy Michael James, is haunted by ghosts born from numerous tragedies that have plagued him all his life. His nightmares leave him with many sleepless nights. Hallucinations occur during his waking hours. His mind is so screwed up, he has a hard time differentiating what’s real from what’s not.</p><p>When he’s literally at the end of his rope, an unlikely, sassy woman with supernatural gifts, barges her way into his life. Her name is Cassie and she’s a southern transplant who’s had her own fair share of tragedies throughout her journey. Unlike Randy, she’s always found a way to keep pressing on and staying positive, even in the darkest of times.</p><p>The two of them seem to meet by chance and almost go their separate ways, wanting nothing to do with the other. However, something (or someone) compels Cassie to not take no for an answer, and make herself a part of this broken man’s life, whether he likes it or not.</p><p>The story starts there, and over the course of the series, our heroine will use her unique form of “treatment and counseling” to get our main character back on the right path. Their journey will encompass a message of hope, even when all hope seems to be gone. Along the way, the two of them will battle his demons side by side, and will cross paths with various individuals who each have issues of their own. Some larger and more nefarious than others.</p><p>The series will take place in Alaska and like all things Alaska, it will have a lot of elements that are larger than life. Everything up here is bigger (sorry Texas) so we decided to try to tell an <strong>Epic Story</strong>, unlike anything that’s come out of this state yet. Call us ambitious. But we think we could have a hit show on our hands, with many seasons to come!</p><p>Our show is fantasy based with elements of drama, horror, suspense, and faith. It has a plethora of flavors to hopefully appeal to a wide audience. Throw in the uplifting message from <i>Touched by an Angel</i>. Add a touch of night terrors from <i>Nightmare on Elm Street</i>. Pour in the visions of ghosts from <i>The Sixth Sense</i>. Topped off with the ability to solve problems with animals from <i>Lassie</i>. All rolled into one delicious burrito.</p><h3>What We Need to Shoot our Pilot</h3><p>Here’s a quick rundown of what this campaign is for:</p><p>We are shooting a <strong>PILOT EPISODE</strong> for the series. The script is written (with more rewrites to come) and shooting dates are locked in. We just need the money so that we can take this story from script and put it to screen.  We landed on a budget of $100,000 to help us cover the costs associated with creating something that’s independent yet still cinematic enough to fall in line with the popular shows you see on TV and streaming services today.</p><p>The money will go towards securing a solid mostly Alaskan cast and crew, locking down locations, renting high-end camera equipment, transportation and accommodations, and most importantly: Craft Services</p><p>Any additional funds will go towards us marketing and pushing the pilot out to the world like crazy. We are laser-focused on making this a success and getting it in front of as many eyes as possible. Ultimately, our goal is to sit down with a network, studio, or streaming platform with our solid, professionally made Pilot, and get them to buy and fund the rest of our series. ABC. FOX. HBO. Netflix. Amazon Prime. Facebook Watch. We are going after them all.</p><p> </p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Intertwined with the Fantasy and fictional storytelling that takes place in our pilot episode, is the subject matter of mental health. Our main character deals with PTSD, depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts… the list goes on. On top of the unique brand of counseling that he gets from our gifted leading lady, we will show Randy Michael James authentically pursue various forms of healing and treatment. He will do the necessary things to finally allow himself to be unburdened by the past and deal with his issues in healthy ways.</p><p>We hope that in doing this, it could bring a realness to what it really takes to bring one’s self out of a dark place. It’s never easy. There’s a lot of ups and downs. Sometimes it may feel more like regression, than progress, but you must go through it and continue to move forward. Our leading guy will do the whole gambit. We hope this, in turn, could be inspiration and a beacon of hope for people who suffer from depression or some of the similar mental illnesses that our character(s) portray, and encourage them to seek help in their own lives.</p><p>On top of that, we want it to be entertaining. TV is the hot medium for storytelling, and we want to put a unique story that’s based in Alaska in the mix. Alaska is popular within the realm of Reality TV, but we feel this great state has even more to offer to the scripted television world. The characters up here are unique and diverse (Most people outside of Alaska, don’t know the melting pot of cultures that we have just in Anchorage alone). The scenery is second to none.  And the stories we could tell about this place are endless.</p><p>We still haven’t touched the surface of the kind of storytelling that can come from the state; we hope this show ignites a fire that gets more shows produced. And we have talented people within the filming industry that can make this happen. We are fortunate enough to have a few of them working on this project with us!</p><h3>Other Ways You Can help</h3><p>If you are unable to donate, you can still help us out in a big way by spreading the word about our project!

<h3>What is INDY - ON THE TOWN?</h3>
<p>INDY - ON THE TOWN is a half-hour docu-series program that aired its first season on WHMB TV-40 and features people around Indy who are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creating New Ideas</li>
<li>Discovering New Potential</li>
<li>Developing New Concepts</li>
<li>Designing the Future</li>
<li>And DARING TO DREAM BEYOND THE REALMS OF IMAGINATION!</li>
</ul>
<p>We're ready to get rolling on a second season showcasing incredible people around the Circle City, and we're asking you to help make that happen!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why This Campaign?</h3>
<p>In an effort to help people around Indy get marketing exposure that they might not otherwise receive, we've launched this campaign to raise money so that we can continue into our next season and continue to feature amazing individuals around greater Indianapolis who are doing amazing things!</p>
<p><b>And... we want to be able to hire and pay film makers, audio technicians, sound operators, lighting technicians, and other personnel a decent fee for their talent and expertise. In addition, contributions to our campaign will help cover other production costs. </b></p>
<ul>
<li>We seek to raise $25,000 to fund season 2.</li>
<li>A TV Program like no other in Indy that brings exposure to people who might not otherwise get discovered.  </li>
<li>In our next season we have a great line up of people and ideas who deliver a powerful and positive message in a time of negativity.</li>
<li>Local, local, local!!! Doing high quality work and we want to focus on events and people doing great things. </li>
<li>Whether you're interested in becoming a major sponsor/producer of a television show, or if you just want to see local programming continue to showcase your favorite city, we have a large variety of contributor levels to match your interest.</li>
<li>Our crowdfunding goal will not only help us continue to produce exciting educational programming, but also to hire local industry professionals. Even if we don't reach the full amount, every dollar we raise will go toward expenses and hiring costs!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>

</div></div>","What is INDY - ON THE TOWN?
INDY - ON THE TOWN is a half-hour docu-series program that aired its first season on WHMB TV-40 and features people around Indy who are:

Creating New Ideas
Discovering New Potential
Developing New Concepts
Designing the Future
And DARING TO DREAM BEYOND THE REALMS OF IMAGINATION!

We're ready to get rolling on a second season showcasing incredible people around the Circle City, and we're asking you to help make that happen!

Why This Campaign?
In an effort to help people around Indy get marketing exposure that they might not otherwise receive, we've launched this campaign to raise money so that we can continue into our next season and continue to feature amazing individuals around greater Indianapolis who are doing amazing things!
And... we want to be able to hire and pay film makers, audio technicians, sound operators, lighting technicians, and other personnel a decent fee for their talent and expertise. In addition, contributions to our campaign will help cover other production costs. 

We seek to raise $25,000 to fund season 2.
A TV Program like no other in Indy that brings exposure to people who might not otherwise get discovered.  
In our next season we have a great line up of people and ideas who deliver a powerful and positive message in a time of negativity.
Local, local, local!!! Doing high quality work and we want to focus on events and people doing great things. 
Whether you're interested in becoming a major sponsor/producer of a television show, or if you just want to see local programming continue to showcase your favorite city, we have a large variety of contributor levels to match your interest.
Our crowdfunding goal will not only help us continue to produce exciting educational programming, but also to hire local industry professionals. Even if we don't reach the full amount, every dollar we raise will go toward expenses and hiring costs!

Each sin is the focus of its own part, with them being mostly self-contained, however, they live within the same story world, with each part hopefully making you think deeper about traits of humanity.</p><p>For our final year graduate project we are making 3 of the 9 parts (however we hope to be able to make the other 6 in due time);</p><ul><li style=""margin-left:40px;"">

</li></ul><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">Howie has spent his life at sea and has become accustomed to a solitary life, however now it seems to have taken a dark turn as he showcases his thoughts and feelings on his crewmates for his therapy video diary, showing his descent into a wrathful state.</p><ul><li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>Episode 7- Invidia</strong> <ul><li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Based around the sin of Envy</li></ul>
</li></ul><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">A pair of brothers work in the same field at a research base, however, one feels constantly overshadowed by their sibling and their achievements and is determined to have the limelight for once.</p><ul><li style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong>Episode 8- Avaritia</strong> <ul><li style=""margin-left:40px;"">Based around the sin of Avarice and Greed</li></ul>
</li></ul><p style=""margin-left:80px;"">A pair of university business students decide to kick-start their careers by taking advantage of the pandemic and setting up a questionable business.</p><p>The vast majority of this production is being done remotely, with the cast and crew coming together from both the UK and other places around the world via software like Zoom to create this short film series. This has drastically changed how we have to go about this production, relying on the integrity of our ideas, and the collaboration of our actors.</p><p>Nefarium is currently your standard student production however with your funding we are hoping to take this project to the next level and add all the little (and big) elements that make a production the highest quality. We hope for this project to showcase the accumulation of what we have learned over our filmmaking journeys at Bournemouth University and encapsulate why we’re so passionate about making drama, in the hopes to deliver the best content we will have made thus far.</p><h3>What We Need and What You Get For Your Help</h3><p>To give the greatest justice to our ideas and scripts, we need your help to raise £2,500 which will go towards production and post-production costs. We have been given nearly no support from our university money-wise for this project so your generosity will directly improve our production by allowing us to focus what money we raise towards areas like set-design and costumes, as well as other areas if we raise enough funds including post-production processes such as sound and music by letting us work with a composer to create a unique soundtrack for this series, allowing us to create a bespoke title sequence to polish the episodes off with, and especially if we raise all the funds we will be able to give a contribution back to our cast who are currently working on this project with us collaboratively and we’d love to be able to show our appreciation for their involvement. We are also hoping to raise funds to be able to submit the short films from this project to festivals.</p><p>As a way of saying thank you for your amazing support and donations, we will be giving out rewards and perks, with the quality of the reward varying upon the donation amount ranging from a massive thank you on our social media to an executive producer credit for your amazing contribution, however, be assured that there will be a reward to any donation given, and we are incredibly grateful for you even considering supporting our project!</p><p>We will also be sharing information on production over on our Facebook page <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/KastorProductions"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/KastorProductions</a>  where you can see behind the scenes pictures, posters, updates and more!</p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Our project hopes to shed a little light on our shared humanity and how we all reflect sins in our everyday lives and how these can become extreme. We feel like each of our stories are realistic, and could happen to nearly everyone if given a push in the wrong direction. So how much is down to us as individuals and how much is in our human nature? </p><p>By supporting our project you’ll also be supporting some indie student filmmakers trying to make their first steps towards professional production and giving us the chance to take a project we are very passionate about to the next level. We have worked over the last three years on our university course on smaller productions just waiting for the chance to show what we can do if given this opportunity and your support will make our project even greater.</p><h3>Are there any risks &amp; challenges?</h3><p>Covid. Pandemic. Lockdowns. Those seem to be the main challenges for everyone these days but with our project, it is especially prevalent. We had to formulate and develop this series in a time of dire uncertainty of what our university would let us do, leading to us making this an entirely remote production. Our crew is spread out all over the UK, with one crew member even being stuck at home in Bulgaria, basically meaning that communication is everything, more so than usual, for this production. But we know this and are prepared to make a production this unconventional way, BBC’s Staged showed that it could be done so we know it is entirely possible. </p><p>Remote filming also means that we as crew won’t be there to help create a set for the actors, instead only being able to communicate our vision to them and hoping they have access to a space suitable, but we’ve factored this into our casting process, and with your funds, we hope we can transform these actors spaces to become the fleshed out locations we’ve created.</p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help Us</h3><p>We completely understand that not everyone is able to donate to a project like this, particularly during this time of financial uncertainty, however, if you believe in us and our project we’d really appreciate you just spreading the word and helping us out that way.</p><p>You could help us out by:</p><ul>

My name is John Wolfe and I am the writer and producer of Wrongfully Convicted - a first of its kind UK male prison drama series. We were set for production in March this year but with the current Covid crisis we had to put it back until just two months ago. Covid has caused a massive impact on all of our lives and has made it harder for me to self-fund this series but needless to say I have strived on and managed to pay for everything needed to date to help launch the careers of everyone involved. We now however need more of a budget for better locations, props and travel costs among other things.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601147890/tpythjhofikgpcwsmfmk.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h2><u><strong>Series Summary</strong></u></h2><p>The series follows Vincent Prince, a quiet man from the north east on a night out with his friend - Garry. A series of violent events that were out of their control lead to Vincent being incarcerated for 5 years. We follow Vincent step by step in his life before the events of that evening, the court proceedings and whilst he serves his time in prison. We watch as he witnesses all the horrors of prison and crawls his way to being top dog.</p><p>I wrote the series to tell the story of what truly happens in prison. It is written from real inmate’s life stories both past to present and no fabricated life stories.</p><p>The production will be made to raise awareness and hopefully rehabilitate people from offending. We also aim to help launch the careers of the actors portraying each role and the crew that are carrying them through it all. As an actor, I understand the difficulty of getting that foot in the door, especially when you aren't too sure how it all works and I am passionate about helping these individuals pursue their passion like I did with mine.</p><p>The actors and crew in the production have all been hand-picked to showcase the talent the UK truly has, while creating a one of a kind unique show and some bigger names have come on board to offer their experience and help for the other actors.</p><p>We will be looking to take this to a major broadcaster once the pilot episode is made and start a much bigger production with more actors and crew.</p><h2><strong><u>What We Need</u></strong></h2><p>We expect the series to take 6-9 months to make. As you see from the images we have already started shooting, but to move to the next stage in making this series we need funds now. We seek £10,000 to cover all costs, including UK travel, editing costs, post production, sound and picture grading, etc.</p><p>£1,500 towards Camera crew</p><p>£1,500 towards Sound</p><p>£1,000 to other crew</p><p>£4,000 Court room and prison hire.</p><p>£1,000 travel expenses for cast</p><p>£1,000 Costume and prop hire</p><p>We have equipment to shoot the episode, and an enthusiastic network of supporters. We believe strongly in open access and we guarantee to make a free version available of the pilot episode.</p><p>Whatever position you hold in respect of crime and punishment, there are hidden stories that need to be told from all sides. This series will tell those stories.</p><h2><u><strong>What You Get</strong></u></h2><p>We have spent a long time discussing the perks for our campaign and we feel that what we chosen will be warmly welcomed. </p><p>We have a range of different perks including social media shout outs, IMDB Thank You credits, signed security shirt, clapperboards, Executive Producer credits, on set visits and more.

We use our different experiences both in life and in the industry in order to educate and train each other. Whilst this can be a challenge, it is also a wonderful opportunity to expand our knowledge and share it too. There are so many different challenges of which we have to overcome on any production, all of which we take as a learning opportunity. These challenges include:</p><p>Organisation - This is a very big and important challenge of which we focus on a lot. We are aware that organisation can make or break a production. It is extremely important for everyone to know where they have to be and when, what they need to be doing, what costume they need and so on. We believe that organisation is the way to success. </p><p>Shoot Schedule - We have a large cast all shooting on different days and at different times. Having a shoot schedule and sticking to it, is such an important detail in order to keep us running smoothly. </p><p>Safety on Set - This is another challenge of which has our focus. Without health and safety in place we would not be making the show. Ultimately, filming is not more important than someone's life. We would rather not film than risk someone. This is very relevant with Covid-19 where we take the rules and regulations very seriously, whilst keeping a watch of any and all updates. We feel at present this is one of our biggest hurdles but with everyone's amazing attitudes to keep each other safe, we are so far succeeding. We require PPE to be worn, social distancing to be kept in place, hand sanitizer is used as well as hand washing on a regular basis. We check everyone's temperatures and have a very open way of communication should anyone have any concerns or feel the need to discuss. If anyone shows any symptoms or feels unwell before or during their shoot times, they will be assessed by the Covid trained team members in order to keep everyone as safe and updated as possible. Not only is this important for Covid-19 reasons but for everyone's general health, safety and well being. </p><h2><u><strong>Say Hello to the Cast </strong></u></h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602951800/nnxu7ykuahowaxkm3bws.png"" src=""""/></p><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603058026/p5uwigby6bxlysuyq5bs.jpg"" src=""""/></h2><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603058050/wxbuivoexouqgnm2vbyp.jpg"" src=""""/></h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603652723/ibgjnbnrx4qxvpmaima5.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603792956/erzl64kio4zksghtcjir.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603792990/yvzmefxon4rt8w6t2m1y.jpg"" src=""""/></h2><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1617475390/qvnwpufkq1qbk3nwbbw7.png"" src=""""/></p><h2><u><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></u></h2><p>We understand that not everyone will be able to contribute to our fundraiser, financially.

My name is John Wolfe and I am the writer and producer of Wrongfully Convicted - a first of its kind UK male prison drama series. We were set for production in March this year but with the current Covid crisis we had to put it back until just two months ago. Covid has caused a massive impact on all of our lives and has made it harder for me to self-fund this series but needless to say I have strived on and managed to pay for everything needed to date to help launch the careers of everyone involved. We now however need more of a budget for better locations, props and travel costs among other things. Series SummaryThe series follows Vincent Prince, a quiet man from the north east on a night out with his friend - Garry. A series of violent events that were out of their control lead to Vincent being incarcerated for 5 years. We follow Vincent step by step in his life before the events of that evening, the court proceedings and whilst he serves his time in prison. We watch as he witnesses all the horrors of prison and crawls his way to being top dog.I wrote the series to tell the story of what truly happens in prison. It is written from real inmate’s life stories both past to present and no fabricated life stories.The production will be made to raise awareness and hopefully rehabilitate people from offending. We also aim to help launch the careers of the actors portraying each role and the crew that are carrying them through it all. As an actor, I understand the difficulty of getting that foot in the door, especially when you aren't too sure how it all works and I am passionate about helping these individuals pursue their passion like I did with mine.The actors and crew in the production have all been hand-picked to showcase the talent the UK truly has, while creating a one of a kind unique show and some bigger names have come on board to offer their experience and help for the other actors.We will be looking to take this to a major broadcaster once the pilot episode is made and start a much bigger production with more actors and crew.What We NeedWe expect the series to take 6-9 months to make. As you see from the images we have already started shooting, but to move to the next stage in making this series we need funds now. We seek £10,000 to cover all costs, including UK travel, editing costs, post production, sound and picture grading, etc.£1,500 towards Camera crew£1,500 towards Sound£1,000 to other crew£4,000 Court room and prison hire.£1,000 travel expenses for cast£1,000 Costume and prop hireWe have equipment to shoot the episode, and an enthusiastic network of supporters. We believe strongly in open access and we guarantee to make a free version available of the pilot episode.Whatever position you hold in respect of crime and punishment, there are hidden stories that need to be told from all sides. This series will tell those stories.What You GetWe have spent a long time discussing the perks for our campaign and we feel that what we chosen will be warmly welcomed. We have a range of different perks including social media shout outs, IMDB Thank You credits, signed security shirt, clapperboards, Executive Producer credits, on set visits and more. Every penny helps in order to make this dream a reality, whilst giving cast and crew valuable experience on set. If more money is raised than the target, these funds will go into making the production bigger and better, although the standard is already at a extremely high. The ImpactWrongfully Convicted is a gripping drama of which will tells the story of what life is really like in UK prisons. We hope for this to not only have a story line of which is gripping and immerses the audience but is also educational - as sometimes visuals are the best ways to understand. We have an amazing cast and crew, who have already been working extremely hard to make this show a reality. They have all put their hearts and souls into this project, we hope to give them the opportunity to continue to grow with us and the show by making the pilot the best it can be.

<p><i>Burn The Witch</i> is an urban fantasy web series set in the modern day United States and centering around a Coven of nine Witches scattered across the country. Through their inherent soul connection and power of astral projection, these Witches are able to communicate, work together, and problem solve across great distances. The series of eleven episodes takes place over the span of two weeks' time and follows the Witches as they battle an unknown enemy who is systematically killing off the members of their Coven. </p>
<p>The initial concept for <i>Burn The Witch</i> was conceived early in 2020. As the COVID-19 pandemic brought the world to a grinding halt, our production team joined the legions of artists around the world desperately searching for safe and engaging ways of continuing to make accessible and meaningful art.</p>
<p>We began with a series of requirements:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">1.) We knew we wanted to make a web series filmed entirely in observation of the shelter in place and social distancing rules dictated by current global circumstances.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">2.)We knew we wanted to work with artists from all across the United States.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">3.) Finally, we knew that we did not want to rely on Zoom as the vehicle by which our actors connected throughout the story.</p>
<p>With all this in mind, one concept leapt out and took root in our hearts and minds: Magic. </p>
<p>Using the conceit of astral projection, we are able to collaborate with actors all across the country and still rely on more conventional modes of storytelling.</p>
<p>We are fortunate enough to be collaborating with artists from seven different cities across three separate states. Through the use of meticulous story boarding, extensive planning, and FaceTime, our Director and Director of Photography are able to clearly and effectively direct our actors, regardless of their geographical location. This mode of filmmaking is uncharted territory, and while it presents its own unique challenges, we are more than ready to rise to the occasion! </p>
<p>You can see a rudimentary example of this filmmaking technique  in our promo video! This video was filmed in our Malibu, Chicago, and Los Angeles Units, using only the filmmaking elements already available in the actor's personal collections. We had an incredible time creating this promo for you all, and cannot wait to begin filming with the proper equipment! This will all be made possible by your generous donations!</p>
<p>We are beyond excited to begin primary filming for <i>Burn The Witch</i>. We have assembled the best possible team to take on this groundbreaking project, and could not be more thrilled to be collaborating with this group of skilled, disciplined, and talented artists!</p>
<p>We thank you for your interest in <i>Burn The Witch</i>, and hope you find yourself able to donate today! Together, we can make this wild Witchy ride a reality! </p>

<p>Our production team first came together while studying Theatre Arts at the Oregon Center for the Arts in Ashland, Oregon. We found that we shared not only cohesive artistic sensibilities, but a fervent passion for producing work based in the tenants of femme empowerment, intersectionality, and the vitality of the human spirit. Since forming our collective, we have produced a multitude of successful projects and are excited to turn our sights to a groundbreaking web series!</p>

This mode of filmmaking is uncharted territory, and while it presents its own unique challenges, we are more than ready to rise to the occasion! 
You can see a rudimentary example of this filmmaking technique  in our promo video! This video was filmed in our Malibu, Chicago, and Los Angeles Units, using only the filmmaking elements already available in the actor's personal collections. We had an incredible time creating this promo for you all, and cannot wait to begin filming with the proper equipment! This will all be made possible by your generous donations!
We are beyond excited to begin primary filming for Burn The Witch. We have assembled the best possible team to take on this groundbreaking project, and could not be more thrilled to be collaborating with this group of skilled, disciplined, and talented artists!
We thank you for your interest in Burn The Witch, and hope you find yourself able to donate today! Together, we can make this wild Witchy ride a reality! 
 

Our production team first came together while studying Theatre Arts at the Oregon Center for the Arts in Ashland, Oregon. We found that we shared not only cohesive artistic sensibilities, but a fervent passion for producing work based in the tenants of femme empowerment, intersectionality, and the vitality of the human spirit. Since forming our collective, we have produced a multitude of successful projects and are excited to turn our sights to a groundbreaking web series!

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Scotland television is absent of anything like Cops and Monsters. The only sci-fi/supernatural show we have is Doctor Who, and that's made in Wales!

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Having raised the funds to shoot 8 episodes for volume 1, our growing fanbase on Facebook and Twitter we know there is an appetite for a show like this, and so far we've had glowing reviews on Amazon Prime.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Not only does making a show like this allow you, the viewer, a chance to watch a brand new supernatural police thriller, but it allows us to make it for you. All of our actors, writers and crew who will be hired to work on the show will be a direct result of YOUR support.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We're also making it to prove that it can be done and that people will watch it. Hopefully catching the eye of producers, commissioners, and other important TV people out there, maybe leading to the show being re-booted with a proper television budget, or more work for the team who work so hard on the show.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We can't make this show without you, the fans, so if you can help us in anyway at all, it'll bring us closer to producing all of series 2.</p>

<h2><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></h2>
<p>If we don't hit our funding goal, we'll be unable to commission any of our new episodes.</p>
<p>We will of course look into further sources of funding, but this would be a brilliant start for us as it means we will have at least 2 new episodes of series 2, which can be used to bring in further funding and support for the rest of the series.</p>

</div></div>","Welcome to the Cops and Monsters: Uprising Production Funds Campaign! This campaign has been created so we can raise at least £1000 to allow us to start shooting the brand new episode of Cops and Monsters: Uprising!If we can reach £4000 then we will be able to shoot episode 2, ""Codename: Hybrid"" which is written by BAFTA winning writer Laura Anne Anderson.We hope we can not only raise the £4000 to shoot episode 2, but also get as close as possible to £25,000 so we can shoot all remaining 5 x 20 minute episodes.Episode 1, ""Remembrance"", by Debbie Moon, has been funded and shot. We are currently editing our new episode but you can watch a special preview below:

 
""Cops and Monsters"" is an on-going, award winning supernatural police thriller set in a near-future Scotland. When vampires, werewolves and zombies come out of hiding, the country breaks out into war and riots with both sides fighting for control. Eventually the First Minister and the heads of the vampire and werewolf societies meet and form a treaty that will allow humans and supernaturals to co-exist. As such a police team, the Paranormal Investigation Team Scotland, are put into place to police and protect both sides.Series 2 sees Maya Hedges infiltrating the S.P.I.D.E.R.S, a militant police force now in charge of the supernatural community, and working with known werewolf assassin Alexis Smith, they will try to bring down Jonathan Clark, the Minister of Justice who is plotting to exterminate all supernatural life.""There’s a full moon over Glasgow, and chaos is in the air.A Monster roams a supernatural zone, mutilating and eating anyone it finds. Alexis is tormented by a vision of The Cult of Many Faces, and worries that her confinement is driving her to madness. Maya battles hostile SPIDERS colleagues and a bigoted new directive from sleazy Minister Clark in her mission to uphold the law. When an old acquaintance ambushes Maya outside SPIDERS HQ, desperately seeking her help, things go from bad to worse.Werewolf therapist Jenny Connor is badly shaken – she was part of a programme aimed at helping supernaturals, and something has gone terribly wrong. A Monster has been unleashed – THE Monster.Distrusting SPIDERS and with nobody else to turn to, Jenny enlists Maya and Alexis to help her find the Monster and put an end to the violence. The group travel to Zone 3, the Werewolf ghetto, to investigate.Between the full moon, Maya’s split loyalties, The Cult’s hounding of Alexis, and a dark secret kept by Jenny, it’ll be a wonder if they make it out of Zone 3 alive.""Last year the first series of the show was distributed on Amazon Prime and we hope series 2 will be available there too.The show has been screened at numerous festivals around the world and we have won a couple of awards, including Best Web Series at the Los Angeles Film Festival.Your money will be spent on the following:
Hiring actors to star in each episode 
Hiring professional TV and film crew members to work on the show 
Book locations for each episode 
When required, travel and accommodation for guest stars 
Film and camera equipment  
Regular and special effects makeup 
Costumes for each episode 
Props to be made and bought 
Expenses for travelling to locations 
Catering for each shoot date 
Editing of each episode 
Visual effects for each episode 
Sound design Music compositions for each episode 
Subtitles for each episode 
If we reach our initial goal of £1000 then we can set up the InDemand setting which will allow us to keep this IndieGoGo campaign running and hopefully raise funds up to £25,000 so we can produce the remaining 5 x 20 minute scripts of series 2!The rest of the series will be penned by James T Harding (""Cupid of the Clyde""), Simon Underwood (""Wolfblood""), Philip Lawrence (Big Finish's ""Doctor Who"") and Fraser Coull (Cops and Monsters showrunner).Series 1 starred a mix of established and local actors from Scotland and the rest of the UK as well as stars such as Leona Kate Vaughan (Wolfblood/Stella), Simon Weir (Trainspotting 2), Sophie Aldred (Doctor Who), James Payton (Captain America), Rachel Teate (Wolfblood), Caitlin Blackwood (Doctor Who), Katrina Bryan (Nina and the Neurons) and James Mackenzie (Raven). We intend to bring back some of these guest stars alongside some brand new faces to the world of Cops and Monsters! Series 1 is currently available on Amazon Prime but you can watch our pilot, one of our minisodes, ""Trapped"", below, and our new series 2 minisode, ""Day One"": 

 
Series 1 varied in duration, with earlier episodes lasting between 7 and 15 minutes, with the remaining episodes around 24 minutes. Series 2 will be 6 x 20 minute episodes.
 


Scotland television is absent of anything like Cops and Monsters. The only sci-fi/supernatural show we have is Doctor Who, and that's made in Wales! We'd like to make our mark and join the ranks of Being Human, In the Flesh, The Fades, Primeval, Torchwood and beyond, and create an exciting, dangerous world of vampires, werewolves and zombies.
Having raised the funds to shoot 8 episodes for volume 1, our growing fanbase on Facebook and Twitter we know there is an appetite for a show like this, and so far we've had glowing reviews on Amazon Prime.
Not only does making a show like this allow you, the viewer, a chance to watch a brand new supernatural police thriller, but it allows us to make it for you. All of our actors, writers and crew who will be hired to work on the show will be a direct result of YOUR support.
We're also making it to prove that it can be done and that people will watch it. Hopefully catching the eye of producers, commissioners, and other important TV people out there, maybe leading to the show being re-booted with a proper television budget, or more work for the team who work so hard on the show.
We can't make this show without you, the fans, so if you can help us in anyway at all, it'll bring us closer to producing all of series 2.

 

In episode 2 we'll have our series regulars back - Ellen Patterson, Billy Kirkwood, Innes Anderson and Chris Bain. They'll be joined by our new cast members Stephen Purdon (River City) and Helen Cuinn.

Joining us for episode 2 will be Nina and the Neuron's star Katrina Bryan, who has already starred in 2 episodes of series 2, and River City actress Louise McMenemy will be joining us new regular character, werewolf Ava McIntyre!   
 We're offering a wide range of perks from Cops and Monsters in return for your support. These include:

A signed script from volume 2 
Volume 1 on DVD or blu-ray with special features
Plus episodes 1 and 2 of our brand new series 
A3 posters which include our original design by Stuart Manning or our ""The Cult and Alexis"" poster.

After surviving being stuck in the middle of nowhere with only a knife, a piece of flint, and a single piece of fruit per day, he realized that he could do anything he set his mind to. What began as a journey of self-discovery where he found within himself a tireless drive to succeed and a genuine sense of perseverance, turned out to be a personal epiphany that changed his life forever.</p><p>What truly sets Lance apart is his unwavering commitment to excellence. Lance excelled in the hospitality industry for 20 years before making a name for himself in real estate by opening his real estate company in 2003. From San Francisco to New York, The Four Seasons Hotel to the Waldorf Astoria, Lance was the ultimate concierge, consistently recognized for always going out of his way to provide guests with the ultimate personal service and attention. It was within the unique atmosphere of success cultivated by The Four Seasons Hotel that Lance’s drive for perfection really began to take flight.  Lance now juggles his Washington, DC real estate company, where he is consistently rated in the top 1% of all Realtors in the USA, and owning and operating his dream Bed &amp; Breakfast, Casa Cool Beans; rated #1 Bed &amp; Breakfast in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on TripAdvisor since its opening 8 years ago!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541178509/dhkdjdqrot6f8gsbpyka.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Carlton Wilborn - Creative Director &amp; Choreographer</strong></p><p><i>Choreographer</i></p><p>Mr. Wilborn has directed Music Videos and shows for major corporate entertainment events, with Cisco Systems and EDS.

(pronounced ""SHō"" and meaning “awesome” or “cool”in Portuguese ) is a television/web series based in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

Come along to find out if Carlton, the dancers, and I can overcome the many obstacles of daily life in Rio de Janeiro, both mental and physical, to create an unforgettable final performance that will catapult the company to greater heights!Here’s where your funding will go!  So please join me for this journey of learning, growing, fun and let's make it big together. With your help, we will be able to finance most of our production costs, but mostly, you'll get a fantastic show to savor and enjoy.If you can't help monetarily, you can still help by spreading the word. Please share this page with ALL of your friends and family, and anyone that may be interested in this project.You can follow us on:FacebookInstagramDavid Laster ProductionsCasa Cool BeansThank you so much for your help!---xoxoDavid Laster        About the Principles David Laster - CEO & Co-FounderDavid was born and raised in the suburbs of Chicago, Illinois, but quickly decided he did not like the cold!  Fast forward a bunch of years and today you will find David juggling, running a newly formed entertainment production company and owning the TripAdvisor #1 rated Bed & Breakfast in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil (note: not cold!), Casa Cool Beans. At an early age, he was drawn to technology and film production; both of which have been a part of his professional journey.  Yes, he was one of “those kids” who purchased one of the first Apple computers and has been an enthusiast ever since.  A bachelor’s degree from Columbia College Chicago was the launching pad to teach technology (still cold).  After several more gigs, he found his passion was not for teaching and quickly shifted his focus to media production, obtaining a master’s degree in film/video production at American University in Washington DC (not too cold). So, don’t call him a nerd; he has evolved to be more of a geek!!!  Taking the leap with his partner, Lance Horsley, in 2010 to move to Rio de Janeiro to open Casa Cool Beans, he had finally found a temperate climate where he could thrive (warm).  Now he is proudly building his production house from scratch and soon he will be blessing the world with his vision of live performances! (hot!)Lance Horsley - President & Co-FounderLance Horsley is one of those people who always aims high. He expects more out of life because he knows anything is possible if you’re willing to work hard to achieve it. It’s an optimistic philosophy he discovered over the course of a grueling, 10-day wilderness survival trek in southern Utah. After surviving being stuck in the middle of nowhere with only a knife, a piece of flint, and a single piece of fruit per day, he realized that he could do anything he set his mind to. What began as a journey of self-discovery where he found within himself a tireless drive to succeed and a genuine sense of perseverance, turned out to be a personal epiphany that changed his life forever.What truly sets Lance apart is his unwavering commitment to excellence. Lance excelled in the hospitality industry for 20 years before making a name for himself in real estate by opening his real estate company in 2003. From San Francisco to New York, The Four Seasons Hotel to the Waldorf Astoria, Lance was the ultimate concierge, consistently recognized for always going out of his way to provide guests with the ultimate personal service and attention. It was within the unique atmosphere of success cultivated by The Four Seasons Hotel that Lance’s drive for perfection really began to take flight.  Lance now juggles his Washington, DC real estate company, where he is consistently rated in the top 1% of all Realtors in the USA, and owning and operating his dream Bed & Breakfast, Casa Cool Beans; rated #1 Bed & Breakfast in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on TripAdvisor since its opening 8 years ago!Carlton Wilborn - Creative Director & ChoreographerChoreographerMr. Wilborn has directed Music Videos and shows for major corporate entertainment events, with Cisco Systems and EDS. His dynamic choreography has brought excitement to many music video artists, most notably Janet Jackson and Madonna. His choreography was also celebrated in the Loose Interpretation commercial campaign for Levi Straus, as well as, in the motion picture Yellow. His one-of-a-kind “Dance” Master Classes have been appreciated throughout North America.DancerWilborn began his professional career as a principal dancer with the world renowned Hubbard Street Dance Company in Chicago. Combining street savvy and urban sensibilities with an inherent elegance and commitment to integrity, he naturally commands the stage. As a dancer he is a force to be reckoned with; and as a choreographer, director, and dance instructor, he guides the pursuits of fellow artists with the same level of excellence and creativity he brings to his own craft.After working as a soloist for five consecutive years in Ruth Page’s Nutcracker, and as a resident guest artist for nine months with Ballet Met, Carlton followed his internal compass to Hollywood. He rapidly became recognized as one of the city’s premiere dancers, landing the position of Madonna’s pillar of strength for the Blond Ambition and The Girlie Show tours.Throughout his career, he has worked with many distinguished artists and entertainment legends such as Herb Alpert, Natalie Cole, Janet Jackson and Michael Jackson; choreographer Twyla Tharp; legendary photographer Herb Ritts; Tony Award-winning director George C. Wolfe, and powerhouse producer Joel Silver, among many others.Life CoachOver the past decade Mr. Wilborn has studied many different modalities of spiritual practices to support him in serving others; His work as a life coach allows him to do private coaching, various group workshops and corporate events. His work as a motivational speaker; promoting courage, healing and freedom, has enabled him to connect with nearly a dozen sober-homes and non-for-profit organizations throughout California.The website www.livingfrontandcenter.com is the go-to place, for all of his empowering services and merchandise.[VERSÃO EM PORTUGUÊS ABAIXO]Caros amigos e futuros espectadores,XO! (pronunciado ""show"" e que significa ""incrível"" ou ""legal"" em português) é uma série de TV e web filmada no Rio de Janeiro.

<p>Greetings! My name is Sarah Goodwin and I'm the creator of Awakening: The Series. This series began as a project for my web series class (originally titled 'Haunted') in 2016 while I was attending NYCDA. I wanted to continue the story and really give this story the best chance at being told. I've worked extremely hard with a fantastic team behind me to finally have the pilot episode wrapped at the end of July of 2018. Currently the pilot is in post and I am making plans to continue with the rest of the first season.</p>
<p>I've always had a passion for film and within the last seven years I have taken many steps forward to improve my skills and bring my ideas to life. Even though I know the in and outs of filmmaking and I completed my first short film ""Broken Home"" in 2016 I am still a student working towards my film certificate. Since I had to work on my series alone during my web series class I learned how to do everything in front and behind the camera to complete four episodes which was the required assignment. I am currently the producer, writer, director and lead in the series along with many other hats that need to be filled when the time calls for it.</p>
