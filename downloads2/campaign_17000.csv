</div><p></p><h3>Who we are...</h3><div><div>
<p>Founded in 2015, Atlanta Dance Collective is a group of artists with a similar vision to create engaging contemporary work in the Atlanta dance scene.  Dance Canvas 2015 served as the catalyst for Atlanta Dance Collective through the mutual involvement of Britt Whitmoyer Fishel and Sarah Stokes. ""<strong>site.</strong>"" choreographed by Britt Fishel, funded through <b>INDIEGOGO</b> and commissioned through Dance Canvas, premiered at the Rialto Center for the Arts and featured Sarah Stokes as one of the dancers. Fishel and Stokes share an interest in creating and performing work and wanted to build a collaborative group of choreographers, dancers, and artists to make dance in the city of Atlanta, thus Atlanta Dance Collective was born. Their 2016 season concert entitled <b>Time + Itinerant</b> was also successfully funded through <b>INDIEGOGO</b> and featured two guest artists Gabriella Dorado (ATL) and Caitlin Dutton (NYC) alongside Fishel and Stokes. </p>
<h3>What we're up to...</h3>
<p>Atlanta Dance Collective strives to connect people through dance within the city of Atlanta. We provide opportunities for dance artists to create new work and engage with audiences in Atlanta, in order to build the community of contemporary dance. We are a dance ""collective"" meaning we are a group of artists who work together to present work of multiple artists and in multiple mediums. </p>
<p>We are extremely excited to share these new opportunities with you for our next season. This September, ADC has been invited to present  work at <b>Skwirlhaus</b>; we will be performing a new work by Britt Fishel involving both film and live performance. We will also be producing our season performance in Spring of 2017 which will include work from artists within the company, as well as guest artists. Our <b>season concert</b> has been a successful way of bringing artists together in the Atlanta dance community by providing an avenue to present work in the city, and we would like to continue doing so. This summer the company will select a guest emerging choreographer to do a residency with our dancers creating a new piece to make its premier at our spring concert!  And again, ADC will host the annual <b>Opine Dance Film Festival, </b>which had its first successful run this past March at Synchronicity Theatre in Atlanta, featuring both a student and professional adjudicated program! And these are just a few of the upcoming projects...</p>

Founded in 2015, Atlanta Dance Collective is a group of artists with a similar vision to create engaging contemporary work in the Atlanta dance scene.  Dance Canvas 2015 served as the catalyst for Atlanta Dance Collective through the mutual involvement of Britt Whitmoyer Fishel and Sarah Stokes. ""site."" choreographed by Britt Fishel, funded through INDIEGOGO and commissioned through Dance Canvas, premiered at the Rialto Center for the Arts and featured Sarah Stokes as one of the dancers. Fishel and Stokes share an interest in creating and performing work and wanted to build a collaborative group of choreographers, dancers, and artists to make dance in the city of Atlanta, thus Atlanta Dance Collective was born. Their 2016 season concert entitled Time + Itinerant was also successfully funded through INDIEGOGO and featured two guest artists Gabriella Dorado (ATL) and Caitlin Dutton (NYC) alongside Fishel and Stokes. 
What we're up to...
Atlanta Dance Collective strives to connect people through dance within the city of Atlanta. We provide opportunities for dance artists to create new work and engage with audiences in Atlanta, in order to build the community of contemporary dance. We are a dance ""collective"" meaning we are a group of artists who work together to present work of multiple artists and in multiple mediums. 
We are extremely excited to share these new opportunities with you for our next season. This September, ADC has been invited to present  work at Skwirlhaus; we will be performing a new work by Britt Fishel involving both film and live performance. We will also be producing our season performance in Spring of 2017 which will include work from artists within the company, as well as guest artists. Our season concert has been a successful way of bringing artists together in the Atlanta dance community by providing an avenue to present work in the city, and we would like to continue doing so. This summer the company will select a guest emerging choreographer to do a residency with our dancers creating a new piece to make its premier at our spring concert!  And again, ADC will host the annual Opine Dance Film Festival, which had its first successful run this past March at Synchronicity Theatre in Atlanta, featuring both a student and professional adjudicated program! And these are just a few of the upcoming projects...

<p><b>The Impact</b><br/></p>
<p>Teens' pregnancies, single mothers, and divorce rate have reached an all-time high in our society, today.  Both single women and men are looking for that perfect mate, but they find it extremely hard to find the right one. Most of them have never heard of the biblical romantic love story of Ruth &amp; Boaz, so they really don't know how to ultimately choose the right person, who God has created just for them. This play will open their eyes to a whole new world of how to date properly and find their real soulmate according to the Word of God.</p>
<p><b>Risks and challenges</b></p>
<p>In a disorderly society, where the media and corporate sponsors are not interested in supporting anything positive by a relative no name, so it’s extremely challenging to secure funding. That’s why we are asking our brothers and sisters of the church, who believe in our message whole-heartedly to step in and help us to raise the funds. The biggest risk we face is that the body of Christ will not go on this journey with us as we advocate to young women and men that God's way is best since the biblical love story of Ruth and Boaz is the greatest example to follow.</p>

The Impact
Teens' pregnancies, single mothers, and divorce rate have reached an all-time high in our society, today.  Both single women and men are looking for that perfect mate, but they find it extremely hard to find the right one. Most of them have never heard of the biblical romantic love story of Ruth & Boaz, so they really don't know how to ultimately choose the right person, who God has created just for them. This play will open their eyes to a whole new world of how to date properly and find their real soulmate according to the Word of God.
Risks and challenges
In a disorderly society, where the media and corporate sponsors are not interested in supporting anything positive by a relative no name, so it’s extremely challenging to secure funding. That’s why we are asking our brothers and sisters of the church, who believe in our message whole-heartedly to step in and help us to raise the funds. The biggest risk we face is that the body of Christ will not go on this journey with us as we advocate to young women and men that God's way is best since the biblical love story of Ruth and Boaz is the greatest example to follow.

<p><b>CHALLENGE: </b>Compensating
a cast of over 20 professional artists with what they deserve. The artists will
be paid out of Ticket sales entirely. This is why the campaign is so important
to cover all pre-production costs.</p>
<p><b>RISK: </b>A
great deal of time and money has been invested in the project. The Risk of not

</h3> <p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">In 1933, sisters Léa and Christine Papin were live-in maids in Le Mans, France. On February 2nd, 1933, they violently murdered their employer and her daughter, then carefully cleaned their tools and returned to their bed in the attic. There, they waited calmly until they were discovered and arrested. The case became a sensation in France, capturing the attention of writer Jean Genet.</span></p>

<p><b>Set, costumes, and props: </b>We'd like our set and costumes to be as stunning as the performances.

We are hoping to raise up to <b>$1,000 </b>to put toward our vision. Alternately, if you have leads on furniture or set pieces that we can use for little or no cost, please let us know!</p>
<p><b>Marketing: </b>We'll be taking advantage of free marketing avenues wherever possible, but we also want to promote the show with a fantastic poster and some physical collateral like postcards.

As an aspiring choreographer this tour will be my debut as a choreographer to the big stage and using it as an entrepreneurial venture it will add to my development as a choreographer by creating possibilities for future collaborations between myself and the companies involved. You will be aiding in strengthening bonds and collaborations between the European countries involved and South Africa.

Apocalypso Theatre Collective is thrilled to announce that Dig Infinity! has been accepted to the 2015 New York International Fringe Festival this August! Hip-Hip Hooray!

So now comes the hard (and fun!) work: we are planning a more elaborate and ambitious production this season and need YOUR generosity in allowing us to expand our vision.

Lord Who? Dig What?

Dig Infinity! is an award-winning immersive theatrical experience celebrating the legacy of Lord Buckley  (1906-1960), a jazz comedian, visionary storyteller/philosopher, hipster saint and premier beatnik rapper.



Lord Buckley was best known for transforming Bible stories, Shakespeare soliloquies, the Classics, myth, legend and history into one-of-a-kind hip-talk monologues combining African-American street argot and the King’s English into a jazzy patois and worldview that anticipated psychedelia and rap by decades. ""Jonah & The Whale,"" ""The Hip Gahn,"" ""Scrooge,"" ""Hipsters, Flipsters & Finger-Poppin' Daddies,"" and ""The Nazz"" are just a few of his hallmark monologues that are the stuff of bohemian fable.







Dig Infinity! received its first full productions at the 2014 Planet Connections Theatre Festivity and garnered three of the fest's top honors: Outstanding Production of an Adaptation, Outstanding Lead Actor (Oliver Trager) and Outstanding Supporting Actor (Russell Jordan).
Dig Infinity! transpires in a surreal radio station where, on the midnight after his death, Lord Buckley spins out his life story to a DJ named Orpheus while demonstrating his signature material. As the two talk, a dialogue interspersed with flashbacks to various points in Lord Buckley's life, the conversation shifts into a discussion about the importance of truth and art, a topic which includes a trip to Hades and a cameo by God as it becomes increasingly apparent that Lord Buckley is bargaining for his very soul.
Lord Buckley’s life and art remain so resonantly timely and why each new generation seems to rediscover and revere his legacy are the ways in which it confronts and comments on controversial components of contemporary American life: religion, language, art, sex, drugs, and race.
Yet despite being a secret subterranean hero to the likes of Bob Dylan, Robin Williams, the Beatles, Grateful Dead, Bill T. Jones, Ken Kesey, Joni Mitchell, Tom Waits, Julie Taymor, George Carlin, Whoopi Goldberg, Henry Miller, Laurence Olivier, Roseanne, Jimmy Buffett, Joan Baez and scores of others, Buckley's achievement has remained tragically overlooked.

The Artists
Dig Infinity! is written, directed by and features Oliver Trager (Lord Buckley's biographer, performer and a keeper of the flame) in the lead role. Oliver has shared His Lordship's work in a variety of settings and media for more than two decades.
Dig Infinity! is graced by a dedicated and talented circle of actors and musicians who have thus far worked for the love of the project and precious few shekels. Foremost amongst these are Russell Jordan (http://www.russelljordan.com/) playing the role of Orpheus and John Kruth leading the band.
Russell has distinguished himself in a number of productions over the past few years. John is a founding member of the transcendent World Beat jazz band Tribecastan (http://tribecastan.tv/) that has performed frequently in and around NYC and toured both Europe and the West Coast.
Rounding out our humble cast is multi-threat actor Ridley Parson and ace Tribecastan drummer-man Boris Kinberg.



The Treasury
Funds are needed for there following costs:
Festival Registration Fee: $700
Venue Director: $500
Insurance: $300
Cast and Crew Compensation: $5000

RISKS & CHALLENGES

2015 will be a challenging year as we work to expand our programming in the Twin Cities while maintaining the high quality of our main season performances. Warriors of Light also presents a unique creative challenge for Artistic Director Karen L. Charles in that the work draws its inspiration from a literary text rather than the historical events and human emotions our audiences are used to. However: 

  Previous youth outreach engagements include residencies with youth at WISE Charter School in Minneapolis, lec dems at the FAIR school, and sold out low-cost student matinees
 Our dancers are experienced, engaging, and knowledgeable teachers--eager to share their love of dance with young people Influential foundations and corporations including The McKnight Foundation, Jerome Foundation, and Best Buy have already contributed to partially sponsor Warriors of Light and our efforts to expand our community impact    All this leads us to feel confident in our ability to produce Warriors of Light as well as offer increased outreach to artists and the general public throughout the year.

</li> <li>The goal of this campaign is to be able to provide start up money for this new business as well as funds to travel to students that are unable to come and train with us in LA.  This campaign will fund our first Tour leg on the East Coast reaching 4 cities in just 5 days.  Proper funding is crucial in making sure we can efficiently  create this amazing and unique convention. While a family member was able to generously fund our first city we traveled to last month, it is important for us to raise the rest of the money ourselves for this future project.  The money we raise would also be able to repay the family member who has given to help start this company.<br/>
</li> <li>HIT THE STEP is not just a convention to us.  Every single member considers each other family, as we all moved from different parts of the globe to live in LA to pursue our dreams.  When we met, we instantly formed friendships and began our incredible journeys together, helping each other reach our most thought about goals.  We struggled to the point of giving up but because we supported each other, we were able to overcome all obstacles and do what we truly love.  To have this campaign funded would mean the world because a small idea that was talked about years ago between friends that were living on each others couches just to survive and pursue our passions would actually come to life.  We believe anything is possible and we want to share our story and talents with the world.<br/>
</li> </ul> <p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p><br/></p> <ul> <li>We would need a total of $15,000 to fund HIT THE STEP's 5 day, 4 City US Teaching Tour.  Faculty $6,200 ($450/class @ 12 classes; $50/day for per diem @ 6 ppl; Tour Manager $500);  Hotel $2,400 ($300/nights @ 2 rooms for 4 nights);  Cinematographer $130; Flights $4,560 (LAX to PA @ 6ppl $1500; PA to NY @ 6ppl $900; NJ to BOS @ 6ppl $360; BOS to LAX @ 6ppl $1800);  Introductory workshop flights $1,190.80.  Perks/Shipping $519.20</li>
<li>PERKS!! Every donation will receive some sort of ""Perk"" whether it's apparel from our faculty members clothing line, a dance lesson or a thank you card for your generosity.  Ultimately, we want people to be a part of building something from the ground up, because together, we are all so powerful and have the ability to create whatever we desire.<br/>
</li> <li>If we don't reach our entire goal, we will teach local workshops until we have enough money to support our cause!!  The money we raise will be saved until we reach our goal.  We are so thankful for any and every donation we receive and are very grateful for the opportunity to raise money for this special convention.<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p><br/></p> <ul> <li>Our project will change the lives of students across the world and it is already beginning.  Our faculty works with some of the most successful artists and choreographers in the industry but have the most humble hearts.  At some point, we were all told some harsh things in pursuing this difficult industry but our love for the arts pushed us into becoming respected in our community and on the road to success.  When this project takes off, our possibilities are endless as far as the impact we will have on the lives of many.<br/>
</li> <li>With everything going on in the world, dance has been able to lift us up and empower us to appreciate every moment.  We want to give people the opportunity to feel real emotion and express themselves in whatever way necessary.  We believe dance is the universal language able to release any tension or negative energy that is felt.  We want to spread love from one side of the globe to another through our art and our faculty's loving, infectious energy!  <br/>
</li>
<li>We have danced/choreographed for talents such as Beyonce, Rihanna, 
Justin Timberlake, Nicki Minaj, Fergie, Gwen Stefani, Ne-Yo, Prince, 
Justin Bieber, Becky G and appeared on TV award shows, talk shows, and
 music videos. Our faculty, separately, has taught in countries such as London, Amsterdam, Spain, Mexico, Poland, Italy, Australia, China, Tokyo and all over the US.   Travelling has made us who we are and being able to travel is a dream come true for us. With this convention, we will be able to visit these places regularly giving endless opportunities to students and ourselves.  As much as we inspire students, some of our biggest inspirations are our students and we couldn't do what we do without them.</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p> <ul> <li>Being professional dancers/choreographers, we face risk and rejection on a daily basis.  Going from an audition, to taking class, to teaching class, to our normal job can be the most exhausting thing we will ever experience.  We spend endless amounts of time preparing for jobs we may never get in hopes we get that one chance or opportunity that will send us on our way.  But it never stops.  Shifting from one job to another is our specialty while and we must be able to transform into different characters who are able to adapt and grow from each experience.  We compare ourselves naturally as we all do in any industry but it is a lot more personal when it comes to dance.  We are exposed and because of that, we are sensitive beings but some of the strongest beings we know.  We understand there will be bumps in the road to achieving our goals, but there is nothing we can't handle.  With every failure we're endured, every time we've been knocked down, we've prevailed stronger and more determined.  <br/>
</li> <li>There is a huge risk in setting up Conventions.  There is a lot of cost as far as paying for the venue, cinematographer, talents, accommodations, and travel.  Once that is paid for, you then have to get the students to come to the classes.  We never know  how many students will come to the workshops, thus not knowing if we can profit until we get enough pre-registered students or walk-ins the day of.  However, because of our wonderful reputation within our community, we are able to pack our classes and sometimes even sell out due to venue capacity!  We are up to handle any task that comes our way and we love a challenge!  We truly love what we do so no matter what happens, nothing will stop us.<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p><br/></p> <ul> <li>We understand not everyone is financially able to help and that's OK!  We primarily know artists and they aren't the most financially stable creatures.  That said, any amount makes a difference and we would love for your support in any way possible!  We are getting there and we're so thankful to be able to see this day!  If you are unable to donate, we ask you help us spread the word about our movement or follow us and our journey.  Social media is huge in this time so we would love you to spread our voice and be a part of HIT THE STEP!  Our website is <a href=""http://www.hitthestep.com;"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.hitthestep.com </a> Instagram/Twitter @Hitthestep ;  Youtube: Hitthestep</li>

     What We Need & What You Get   We would need a total of $15,000 to fund HIT THE STEP's 5 day, 4 City US Teaching Tour.  Faculty $6,200 ($450/class @ 12 classes; $50/day for per diem @ 6 ppl; Tour Manager $500);  Hotel $2,400 ($300/nights @ 2 rooms for 4 nights);  Cinematographer $130; Flights $4,560 (LAX to PA @ 6ppl $1500; PA to NY @ 6ppl $900; NJ to BOS @ 6ppl $360; BOS to LAX @ 6ppl $1800);  Introductory workshop flights $1,190.80.  Perks/Shipping $519.20
PERKS!! Every donation will receive some sort of ""Perk"" whether it's apparel from our faculty members clothing line, a dance lesson or a thank you card for your generosity.  Ultimately, we want people to be a part of building something from the ground up, because together, we are all so powerful and have the ability to create whatever we desire.
 If we don't reach our entire goal, we will teach local workshops until we have enough money to support our cause!!  The money we raise will be saved until we reach our goal.  We are so thankful for any and every donation we receive and are very grateful for the opportunity to raise money for this special convention.
    The Impact   Our project will change the lives of students across the world and it is already beginning.  Our faculty works with some of the most successful artists and choreographers in the industry but have the most humble hearts.  At some point, we were all told some harsh things in pursuing this difficult industry but our love for the arts pushed us into becoming respected in our community and on the road to success.  When this project takes off, our possibilities are endless as far as the impact we will have on the lives of many.
 With everything going on in the world, dance has been able to lift us up and empower us to appreciate every moment.  We want to give people the opportunity to feel real emotion and express themselves in whatever way necessary.  We believe dance is the universal language able to release any tension or negative energy that is felt.  We want to spread love from one side of the globe to another through our art and our faculty's loving, infectious energy!  

We have danced/choreographed for talents such as Beyonce, Rihanna, 
Justin Timberlake, Nicki Minaj, Fergie, Gwen Stefani, Ne-Yo, Prince, 
Justin Bieber, Becky G and appeared on TV award shows, talk shows, and
 music videos. Our faculty, separately, has taught in countries such as London, Amsterdam, Spain, Mexico, Poland, Italy, Australia, China, Tokyo and all over the US.   Travelling has made us who we are and being able to travel is a dream come true for us. With this convention, we will be able to visit these places regularly giving endless opportunities to students and ourselves.  As much as we inspire students, some of our biggest inspirations are our students and we couldn't do what we do without them.
   Risks & Challenges    Being professional dancers/choreographers, we face risk and rejection on a daily basis.  Going from an audition, to taking class, to teaching class, to our normal job can be the most exhausting thing we will ever experience.  We spend endless amounts of time preparing for jobs we may never get in hopes we get that one chance or opportunity that will send us on our way.  But it never stops.  Shifting from one job to another is our specialty while and we must be able to transform into different characters who are able to adapt and grow from each experience.  We compare ourselves naturally as we all do in any industry but it is a lot more personal when it comes to dance.  We are exposed and because of that, we are sensitive beings but some of the strongest beings we know.  We understand there will be bumps in the road to achieving our goals, but there is nothing we can't handle.  With every failure we're endured, every time we've been knocked down, we've prevailed stronger and more determined.  
 There is a huge risk in setting up Conventions.  There is a lot of cost as far as paying for the venue, cinematographer, talents, accommodations, and travel.  Once that is paid for, you then have to get the students to come to the classes.  We never know  how many students will come to the workshops, thus not knowing if we can profit until we get enough pre-registered students or walk-ins the day of.  However, because of our wonderful reputation within our community, we are able to pack our classes and sometimes even sell out due to venue capacity!  We are up to handle any task that comes our way and we love a challenge!  We truly love what we do so no matter what happens, nothing will stop us.
    Other Ways You Can Help   We understand not everyone is financially able to help and that's OK!  We primarily know artists and they aren't the most financially stable creatures.  That said, any amount makes a difference and we would love for your support in any way possible!  We are getting there and we're so thankful to be able to see this day!  If you are unable to donate, we ask you help us spread the word about our movement or follow us and our journey.  Social media is huge in this time so we would love you to spread our voice and be a part of HIT THE STEP!  Our website is www.hitthestep.com  Instagram/Twitter @Hitthestep ;  Youtube: Hitthestep

<p><b>What is the work about?</b><br/></p>
<p>Muscle
memory is a contemporary dance performance piece that investigates
the capacity in which our bodies can carry memories, positive or
negative, triumphant and failed. The
piece involves a creative process that utilizes different methods to
physicalize each performers' personal memory, through sharing a
memory of intimacy, a memory of being scared or feeling overwhelming
joy or a memory of utter sadness, the choreography of the piece
attempts to take our memories and bring them back to life through
movement. The result is both literal and abstract choreography that
unfolds as a movement journal, conveying memory in its most visceral
form, through flesh, bone and breath. <br/></p>
<p><b>Who are we?</b></p>
<p>My name is Marlowe Porter, I am a dance artist dedicated to creating and performing in engaging dance works that impact the way we think about ourselves as physical beings and that deter from  mind-body dichotomies. I am choreographing and performing in this piece along with 5 amazing collaborators - Mary-Dora Bloch-Hansen, Jessie Garon, Julie McLachlan, Amanda Pye and Caroline Sawyer. We are all practicing professional dance artists that dedicate an enormous amount of energy, time and soul to this important art form.</p>
<p><b>Why we need your help?</b><br/></p>
<p>We have been graciously accepted into this year's Scotiabank Nuit Blanche, an all night art festival that gives audiences the opportunity to take in 12 hours of non-stop and free art exhibits of many disciplines. The unfortunate catch is that there is zero funding for artists and we are left  to find other means of generating funds. <i><b>We are looking for your help to raise money to pay the artists, to help expose audiences to contemporary dance and to keep it alive and thriving in our communities!</b></i><br/></p>
<p><b>Where will the money go?</b></p>
<p>All the money raised will go to the following:<br/></p>
<p>-Artists fees for 6 performers<br/></p>
<p>-Promotional material fees (printing for posters and postcards)</p>
<p>-Costume fees<br/></p>
<p>-Rehearsal space rental fees<br/></p>
<p><b>Where and when is it happening?</b></p>
<p>The work will be performed on October 3rd 2015 as part of Scotiabank Nuit Blanche at 7 Hart House Circle, East Common Room, Toronto, Ontario. The piece will be happening non-stop all night from 7PM- 7AM!!</p>

<p>For most
of the past 100 episodes I have been the sole host and producer of <b><i>Balancing Pointe </i></b><b><i>Podcast</i></b>.
 Recently I partnered with NYCB Principal dancer Megan Fairchild to add a
new segment to my show. </p>
<p style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px; font-weight: normal; text-align: center;""></p>

<p></p>
<p>This was somewhat surreal, as Megan's image donned the walls
of my daughter's bedroom for most of her youth.  The new segment is called
the <b><i>ASK
Megan</i></b> show where she provides thoughtful answers
to questions provided by our listeners.  This show provides a unique
perspective and an added benefit to my show as it has helped me educate and
inspire a greater community in ballet.</p>

<p>One important piece of information I've learned along my journey
is that Podcasting is a perfect medium to educate and inspire a very large

</div></div>","Announcing...
THE Premiere Dance Network!

In a few short weeks, I will be launching the Premiere Dance Network, a podcast network dedicated solely to the dance community; a first of its kind.  
Who am
I?

My name is Kimberly
Falker and I am the host of Balancing Pointe Podcast where I interview successful and
inspiring professionals who are living and working in the world of ballet.  My Podcast was born out of a goal to figure out a road map to help guide my then 13 year old girl daughter as she traveled into the
world of professional ballet.



I wanted to create an inspirational resource for dancers
and their parents by providing the journeys of REAL professionals and their
personal stories into success. 
100 Episodes later...
Today marks the 100th episode of my Podcast with over to 100,000 listeners in 117 countries!
My daughter just turned 16, and while she is still on her journey into ballet...I am now traveling an unexpected journey of my own.



My
personal journey into ballet and Podcasting has been such an amazing adventure.
I am incredibly blessed to have met so many inspirational professionals and to
know that in my own way, I have been able to give back to this beautiful art
form and help make a difference in the lives of others. 

New Directions...

For most
of the past 100 episodes I have been the sole host and producer of Balancing Pointe Podcast.
 Recently I partnered with NYCB Principal dancer Megan Fairchild to add a
new segment to my show. 




This was somewhat surreal, as Megan's image donned the walls
of my daughter's bedroom for most of her youth.  The new segment is called
the ASK
Megan show where she provides thoughtful answers
to questions provided by our listeners.  This show provides a unique
perspective and an added benefit to my show as it has helped me educate and
inspire a greater community in ballet.
New Ideas....

One important piece of information I've learned along my journey
is that Podcasting is a perfect medium to educate and inspire a very large
audience.  In fact Podcasting is the perfect platform to provide information to
much larger dance community in all genres of dance; not just in ballet.  

THE Premiere Dance Network


This network will educate, inform,
inspire and provide a unique platform for dancers, teachers, parents and
the entire community of dance.  The proven success of Balancing
Pointe and the Ask
Megan shows will serve as the
anchor shows for my network of Podcast shows. 


Balancing
Pointe and ASK Megan will continue each week on schedule, providing
you with valuable education and inspiration covering the world of professional
Ballet  The Premiere Dance Network will provide an expanded platform, adding Podcast shows that
involve other genres of dance; thus allowing each genre to have their unique
voice in the dance network.



The first phase of the Launch will
be the creation of a professional media production for listener education,
marketing and use with potential future partners.
This phase
will open new doors for professionals involved in each genre of dance to
educate and inspire their perfect audience through Podcasting.  The video
will highlight the network I am creating and its anchor shows using motion
graphics, testimonials, music and live dancers.  The video will
incorporate the vision of the future of the network going forward. 

This is where YOU come in.

I am seeking to raise funds to create a professional video
using an award winning firm.  The video will be shot in Ultra HD. 
The funds raised will be used to cover the cost of motion graphics, green
screen production (which is necessary to allow for the vex work needed in the
video), and the post production editing.
I am asking for YOUR support to help me raise the $5000 necessary to cover video production costs.

<h3>Impact</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p>The modern world emphasizes cleanliness, perfection, and production.  As we negotiate these cultural expectations, the chaotic, dark aspects of society and  individual are often unacknowledged and repressed.  For some, this takes the form of depression or mental illness; for some it is a hidden, unresolved trauma or addiction; for others, a sudden loss of identity and purpose.   Enacting Inanna's descent awakens us to the emptiness and decay that we may attempt to evade, and it reminds us that these aspects of the human experience have value. The Inanna myth reveals that light cannot exist without darkness, and that death  is part of the cycle of life.  </p>
<p>Alison and Sharon are both in their final semester of the MFA/Interdisciplinary Arts program at Goddard College.  They will be leading a team of dancers, singers, and actors in a two week long intensive process of production development.    As such, this performance/experience will evolve directly from the personal experiences and vision of the women who take part.    Both the collaborative process and the performance itself provide a unique and powerful opportunity to honor and examine the darker side of our identities; enacting both our own transformations and providing a scaffolding for others to embark on a personal journey into their dark sides. </p>

<div>British musical theatre is thriving at the moment.  Our team's mission is to create professional, unique shows that are exciting, imaginative, and accessible to theatre lovers in America, starting in the Big Apple at the wonderful Chain Theatre!</div>

</div>
<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <div>So here's what we need...</div>
<div>We need to raise $9,000 (£5775.27) to make sure this production gets the professionalism it deserves! </div>

<div><b>But Where is Your Money Going?</b></div>
<div>Well let us break it down for you...</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>OUR VENUE</b></div>
<div>Our beautiful venue is The Chain Theatre in Long Island City, just a short train ride from Manhattan!  This wonderful space unfortunately comes at a cost and this is $4,500 (£2887.63).  We love this intimate venue for The Dreaming and we know that it would be a perfect home for our project!</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>RIGHTS</b></div>
<div>To perform such beautiful musical theatre we have to license the show through a publishing company.  The wonderful people at Faber Music, who hold the rights, have quoted $1496.04 (£960).  It's a lot of money but we promise you, the music to this show is worth that amount alone! </div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>AUDITION &amp; REHEARSAL SPACE</b></div>
<div>AUDITION SPACE - The most important thing in this show.... the cast.  We need a cast of talented performers to join us on this wonderful venture, and to do this we need to hold auditions, which would cost around $400 (£259.34) to ensure our audition venue is accessible to a large number of performers!</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>REHEARSAL SPACE - We want our company to be able to feel as comfortable as they can during rehearsals, which is why we would like to raise around $1,500 - $2,000 (£962.54- £1283.39) so that we can have a suitable and safe space to rehearse in! </div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<div><b>SET AND COSTUME</b></div>
<div>Obviously set, props and costume are extremely important to the show and we want to be able to be as creative as we can!  So we are looking to raise around $250 - $300 (£160.42- £194.50) to ensure our cast looks fantastic on stage, surrounded by a beautifully creative world.</div>

AUDITION SPACE - The most important thing in this show.... the cast.  We need a cast of talented performers to join us on this wonderful venture, and to do this we need to hold auditions, which would cost around $400 (£259.34) to ensure our audition venue is accessible to a large number of performers!

REHEARSAL SPACE - We want our company to be able to feel as comfortable as they can during rehearsals, which is why we would like to raise around $1,500 - $2,000 (£962.54- £1283.39) so that we can have a suitable and safe space to rehearse in! 

SET AND COSTUME
Obviously set, props and costume are extremely important to the show and we want to be able to be as creative as we can!  So we are looking to raise around $250 - $300 (£160.42- £194.50) to ensure our cast looks fantastic on stage, surrounded by a beautifully creative world.

Where Do The Funds Go If We Don't Reach Our Goal
Have no fear! Any money that is donated still goes towards our project and helps us try and achieve our dream!

 documenting the names and lives of these individuals. Over the last year, more than 150 individuals have participated in combination quilting circles/peace circles across Chicago.  In partnership with grassroots groups, religious organizations, art spaces and schools, we are sewing together the memories of those lost to police violence, while discussing questions of transformative justice, police accountability, and 
community safety. </span><br/><br/>Gone But Not Forgotten is a collaboration between Rachel Wallis and the grassroots group <a href=""http://wechargegenocide.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">We Charge Genocide. </a><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need <br/>
</h3> <p>The initial materials for the quilt and the 2015 quilting circles were funded by a $5,000 grant from the Chicago Department of Art and Special Events, but we need your help to bring this project to completion! <br/></p>
<p>We need a minimum of $7,000 to be able to finish the 30 foot quilt and mount an exhibition featuring the quilt, process photos, and a video installation with interviews with the friends and families of some of the victims. <br/></p>
<p>Your donations will help pay for: <br/></p>
<ul><li>
<b>A full color publication that will accompany the exhibit</b>, 
featuring process photos and quotes from participants in the quilting 
circles; an examination of the research and data involved in uncovering 
the names in the quilt; selected stories of the victims included in the 
project; and a complete list of all of the victims. <br/>
</li></ul> <ul>
<li>
<b>A zine, created in partnership with the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/forthepeoplecollective/?fref=ts"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">For The People Artist Collective</a></b>, which will provide a background of the Movement for Black Lives in Chicago and ways that visitors to the exhibit can take action to end police violence. <br/>
</li>
<br/> <li>
<b>Graphic design and publicity materials for the exhibition. </b><br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>The labor needed to complete the quilt and create the video installation.</b> This project has been made possible by hundreds of volunteer hours over the last year, from myself, circle keepers, teaching artists, partner organizations, and photographers. In order to create the best possible exhibition, we're hoping to pay myself, the creator of the video installation, and a project assistant for at least some of the final work to complete the project. <br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This exhibit will happen regardless of whether or not we reach our goals through this campaign. We have applied for grants, received support from the universities where we work and study, and drawn on the talents and generosity of dozens of artists and activists from around the city in order to bring the project this far. <b>Your donation will allow Gone But Not Forgotten to be exhibited with the care, attention to detail, and support that this urgent issue deserves. </b><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>Gone But Not Forgotten is more than just a quilt or a gallery exhibit - it is a space for ongoing organizing around police brutality, accountability, and transformative justice. We have partnered with grassroots groups on the front lines of the Movement for Black Lives around the city in the creation of the quilt, and the exhibit will continue that commitment. Throughout the gallery show we will feature panel discussions and workshops on issues related to the project. <br/><br/>Once our initial gallery exhibit is over, this funding will allow us to package up the show and related publications and offer them to other community spaces and galleries across Chicago and even the country, so that the project can continue to be a catalyst for organizing even after the quilting is complete. <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> If we do not raise enough funding for this exhibit, we may have to scale back our broader goals for the exhibit (like the accompanying publications and workshops). Although we hope to show the quilt in the fall of 2016, we're still in talks for the final exhibit space, and there is a possibility that exhibition date will have to be moved into 2017. The quilt will be finished and displayed in some form, however, regardless of funding. <br/></p> <ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <ul> <li>
<b>Host a quilting circle</b>! Quilting circles will continue through June 2016, and we're still partnering with organizations who would like to host the project. <br/>
</li> <li>
<b>Help with the sewing of the quilt!</b> Do you have experience with machine sewing or quilting? Let us know! We still need support in piecing and quilting the final panels. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Offer a space to exhibit the quilt!</b> Do you have a wheelchair accesible art or community space that is interested in showing the Gone But Not Forgotten exhibit, either in late 2016 or 2017? Let us know! <br/>

 The initial materials for the quilt and the 2015 quilting circles were funded by a $5,000 grant from the Chicago Department of Art and Special Events, but we need your help to bring this project to completion! 
We need a minimum of $7,000 to be able to finish the 30 foot quilt and mount an exhibition featuring the quilt, process photos, and a video installation with interviews with the friends and families of some of the victims. 
Your donations will help pay for: 

A full color publication that will accompany the exhibit, 
featuring process photos and quotes from participants in the quilting 
circles; an examination of the research and data involved in uncovering 
the names in the quilt; selected stories of the victims included in the 
project; and a complete list of all of the victims. 
 

A zine, created in partnership with the For The People Artist Collective, which will provide a background of the Movement for Black Lives in Chicago and ways that visitors to the exhibit can take action to end police violence. 

 
Graphic design and publicity materials for the exhibition. 


The labor needed to complete the quilt and create the video installation. This project has been made possible by hundreds of volunteer hours over the last year, from myself, circle keepers, teaching artists, partner organizations, and photographers. In order to create the best possible exhibition, we're hoping to pay myself, the creator of the video installation, and a project assistant for at least some of the final work to complete the project. 


This exhibit will happen regardless of whether or not we reach our goals through this campaign. We have applied for grants, received support from the universities where we work and study, and drawn on the talents and generosity of dozens of artists and activists from around the city in order to bring the project this far. Your donation will allow Gone But Not Forgotten to be exhibited with the care, attention to detail, and support that this urgent issue deserves. 
    The ImpactGone But Not Forgotten is more than just a quilt or a gallery exhibit - it is a space for ongoing organizing around police brutality, accountability, and transformative justice. We have partnered with grassroots groups on the front lines of the Movement for Black Lives around the city in the creation of the quilt, and the exhibit will continue that commitment. Throughout the gallery show we will feature panel discussions and workshops on issues related to the project. Once our initial gallery exhibit is over, this funding will allow us to package up the show and related publications and offer them to other community spaces and galleries across Chicago and even the country, so that the project can continue to be a catalyst for organizing even after the quilting is complete. 
  Risks & Challenges  If we do not raise enough funding for this exhibit, we may have to scale back our broader goals for the exhibit (like the accompanying publications and workshops). Although we hope to show the quilt in the fall of 2016, we're still in talks for the final exhibit space, and there is a possibility that exhibition date will have to be moved into 2017. The quilt will be finished and displayed in some form, however, regardless of funding.     Other Ways You Can Help  
Host a quilting circle! Quilting circles will continue through June 2016, and we're still partnering with organizations who would like to host the project. 
 
Help with the sewing of the quilt! Do you have experience with machine sewing or quilting? Let us know! We still need support in piecing and quilting the final panels. 


Offer a space to exhibit the quilt! Do you have a wheelchair accesible art or community space that is interested in showing the Gone But Not Forgotten exhibit, either in late 2016 or 2017? Let us know!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Hello! 


My name is
Anastasia Rybachuk. I’m Russian and write poems in Russian and in English and
perform on TV and live on stage.



People often tell
me that my performances inspire them to write their own poems. That before they
saw me on TV, they never thought that poetry might not bore them to death. It can make them smile! 




In fact, even the reviewers’ faces seem to light up – they
nominated me for the National Literary Award ‘Poet of the Year 2015’.
My poetry is
controversial and eccentric. For some unknown reason, my performances break all the rules, and alter the
standards by which people usually judge poetry, theatre and female
comedy.

So the Edinburgh
Fringe is the perfect place for me. It’s the boldest festival in the world with
no boundaries and limits, defying the norm for the whole universe! A triumph of
creativity and artistic freedom! 
I was brave (or
crazy) enough to take part in the 2015 Edinburgh Fringe. To say that it blew my
mind would be an understatement.

It was also a great
experience in terms of the sense of anticipation and running around like a
headless chicken even though I had no idea about what kind of adventure and
surprises were waiting for me. There are no festivals on such a large scale in
Russia and none of my colleagues have taken part in the Edinburgh Fringe (or
any kind of the Fringe) before. So it was like one small step to reaching the
Moon for both Russian poetry and comedy!





Despite all the challenges, my performance was a success with BBC confirming this in its article. Hurrah!About My Dream
Now I do want to repeat and certainly outdo my own performance in the next Fringe – with
all the experience I gained last year and all the passion for art I’ve always

It’s remarkable for the whole world! It proves that although the Tower of Babel

So by supporting my

learnt a lot since that first attempt so we can’t but succeed now!
It would be a very
exciting trip for both of us – my trip to the English soul by means of your
language, and your trip to the Russian soul by means of my rhymes. 



I must warn you
that it all may end up in a very unexpected way... :-) But we will enjoy this funny
and exciting trip, I promise! 
So here we go!

Video production $2,000 – video shooting of my show, and further editing and production of the full and promo videos for those who may not be able to attend the show in August.


Transportation $3,000 – yes, Russia is very far away.


Accommodation $5,000 – I wouldn’t stay in a posh hotel, such as Marriott. Edinburgh is quite an expensive place to stay in August, sadly.


Food $600 – something to eat in August.


Choreographer $1,600 – three times a week over a three month period before the show.

What if I don't reach my entire goal? 
I would be honest with you – participating in the Fringe 2016 is very important for me. I feel like I must make it by all means. That’s why I will do my best to think of other ways to raise enough money. So if anyone knows a kidney surgeon to assist me with my next plan – feel free to provide me with their contact details :-)
Seriously, I would keep the raised funds for the Fringe 2017. I won't give up so easily! 


..but please Help Make it Happen in 2016!
I do hope that you can support my dream and we, together, can make the Fringe 2016 come true for me - it means a lot to me! 



Thank you very much! Большое спасибо!:-)

Centered around the opening of downtown Oakland’s newest tech hub Uptown Station, <i>WE GO BOOM! </i>explored the impact of the tech industry on the city of Oakland, asking: How does the tech industry effect long-time Oakland residents and residents of color?

<p>The impact of our work on the audiences we gathered was overwhelming:<b> the majority of our audiences stayed to participate in post-show forums, hungry to share experiences, pose questions, and exchange knowledge about how to achieve development without displacement. </b>Longtime Oakland resident Nicole Dixon felt that our work was “amazing, and it shined light around the complexities of the issue” (as reported in <a href=""https://oaklandnorth.net/2015/04/09/new-play-we-go-boom-explores-tensions-between-tech-industry-and-oakland-community/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>Oakland North</a>).</p>As tech surges in Oakland (we now know Uber will occupy Uptown Station), and Mayor Schaaf pushes “techquity” as a solution to growing inequalities, we wish to push the conversation forward from awareness of tech’s impact on our city toward solutions to ensuring just outcomes. <b>With <i>PLACE to LAND (an oakland love story)</i>, we will deeply explore the histories of displacement and resistance in the Bay, learn what we can do to ensure a just future for Oakland, and empower our neighbors to act. </b><br/><br/><br/><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><b>We need the support of our neighbors who love Oakland,</b> and want a future that can hold and take care of all of us, to secure the time, space, and tools to build this piece of theater. <b>This project is for our communities, and accountable to our communities. </b>If you are hungry to explore the questions we are, to learn how the changes you ache to see can happen, to activate more of your neighbors to support the incredible movement work you are already doing―please help us create this project.</p>
<p>We have already secured some crucial support for <i>PLACE to LAND (an oakland love story)</i>: <b>we won a residency from Paul Dresher Ensemble in West Oakland</b> to support our rehearsal process and are augmenting this opportunity with work-trade agreements earning us rehearsal time at <a href=""http://www.ymtcberkeley.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Youth Musical Theater Company</a> and <a href=""https://shotgunplayers.org/Online/studios"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shotgun Studios</a>.

<b><br/></b><br/><h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><b>This project is vital now. We are in a crisis, evidenced by the more than 1,000 evictions happening per month in Oakland.</b> As the Bay Area becomes the tech capital of the world, gentrification has emerged as the newest form of displacement in a long line of systemic violence perpetrated against black folks in Oakland, including “segregation, redlining, urban renewal, deindustrialization, planned shrinkage/catastrophic disinvestment, [and] HOPE VI,” and which began with the theft of this land, Huichin, from the Ohlone people (<a href=""http://cjjc.org/en/publications/reports/item/1421-development-without-displacement-resisting-gentrification-in-the-bay-area"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>Development Without Displacement: Resisting Gentrification in the Bay Area</a>. 2014. Causa Justa:: Just Cause, p. 47). Other marginalized communities also face displacement.</p>
<p>Understanding the policies that drive displacement is central to ending it. <b>We hope to educate audiences about the legacy of colonization, capitalism, and white supremacy that still drive displacement today and to envision a future that re-centralizes humanity over profit. </b><br/></p>
<p>By encompassing voices from in and out of the tech industry, and <b>centering the voices of community members most impacted by displacement and other violence</b>, <i>PLACE to LAND (an oakland love story)</i> will contribute to the dialogue about how to create a just future for Oakland.</p>
<b>We believe that theater is a unique tool that promotes healing and a platform for visualizing and experimenting with solutions in this time of crisis.</b> By supporting this project, you are not only joining the conversation―you are making this visualization and planning for the future happen.<h3> </h3>

“Alternating between soliloquy, multi-character scenes, song and dance routines, and audience interaction, ‘We Go Boom’ created a fun and thought-provoking atmosphere to discuss the effect of technology in the Bay area.” (The Berkeley Graduate)PLACE to LAND (an oakland love story) will extend the questions raised by The Bonfire Makers' first ensemble-created theater piece, WE GO BOOM!, which premiered in March and April 2015 at the Temescal Arts Center, the Omni Commons, and UC Berkeley. Centered around the opening of downtown Oakland’s newest tech hub Uptown Station, WE GO BOOM! explored the impact of the tech industry on the city of Oakland, asking: How does the tech industry effect long-time Oakland residents and residents of color? How is technology changing the way we interact with our communities?  Why is there a lack of diversity in the tech industry? Can technology be a tool of social justice? Where do we go from here?

The impact of our work on the audiences we gathered was overwhelming: the majority of our audiences stayed to participate in post-show forums, hungry to share experiences, pose questions, and exchange knowledge about how to achieve development without displacement. Longtime Oakland resident Nicole Dixon felt that our work was “amazing, and it shined light around the complexities of the issue” (as reported in Oakland North).As tech surges in Oakland (we now know Uber will occupy Uptown Station), and Mayor Schaaf pushes “techquity” as a solution to growing inequalities, we wish to push the conversation forward from awareness of tech’s impact on our city toward solutions to ensuring just outcomes. With PLACE to LAND (an oakland love story), we will deeply explore the histories of displacement and resistance in the Bay, learn what we can do to ensure a just future for Oakland, and empower our neighbors to act. What We Need & What You Get
We need the support of our neighbors who love Oakland, and want a future that can hold and take care of all of us, to secure the time, space, and tools to build this piece of theater. This project is for our communities, and accountable to our communities. If you are hungry to explore the questions we are, to learn how the changes you ache to see can happen, to activate more of your neighbors to support the incredible movement work you are already doing―please help us create this project.
We have already secured some crucial support for PLACE to LAND (an oakland love story): we won a residency from Paul Dresher Ensemble in West Oakland to support our rehearsal process and are augmenting this opportunity with work-trade agreements earning us rehearsal time at Youth Musical Theater Company and Shotgun Studios. But this still leaves us with expenses.We’ve budgeted:
$5000 to support the 8 artists working to build this show.
$1000 to rent performance space and equipment.
$1100 to cover all other direct show costs: marketing materials, advertising, research materials, props, costumes, set, refreshments for panelists, script printing, our BART fare/bus fare/gas and tolls, and more.
$900 in overhead to make our collective, and this work, sustainable: video and photo documentation and editing, web hosting, the cuts taken by Indiegogo and BrownPaperTickets, and more.

How can a small ensemble of artists, most of whom are not from Oakland, hope to do justice to a topic as enormous as Oakland’s history and future? With the help of our community.

We are talking with folks on the front lines for affordable housing and other key policies, economists, tech workers, long-term residents, self-identified gentrifiers, and more! This play needs many different viewpoints in order to create dialogue. We work from the heart to foster trust with our interview participants and respect their stories by acknowledging that while oppressive systems impact each of us in very different ways, all of our liberation is bound up together.

</div></div>","Dear Friends, 
Many of you have been a huge part of my creative life and for that I am so grateful.  
There have been so many new beginnings with my move to Los Angeles.  I want you to be a part of it, so I am sharing this special project with you and asking for your help. 



Why R.ED? Why Now? 
My creative voice is multi-dimensional.  I would like to believe that I develop artists not just dancers.  Throughout my career I found that there were few creative outlets for me and my dancers, so I created Rhapsody En Dance  - R.ED.  
R.ED is a movement experience that shatters the boundaries between concert and commercial dance by fusing hip-hop, street jazz and contemporary dance styles.  It is a natural extension of my creative voice. The dancers are my sentences.  The movement I create, is the story. 
The company began in New York City with a small group of gifted dancers who brought my vision to life.  Now, we are embarking on the company's first west coast premiere. 


R.ED is not just about the dance. 
It’s about breaking out of the labels and boxes we find ourselves in, especially in this industry.  What we all face at one time or another in our lives; questions about who we really are, what we have to say and how will we say it.  How will we ultimately be defined and who gets to say so?


We want you to be a part of our journey, our movement.  #GetInspiRED!

Become a part of our R.ED family.  Here is how you can help us?


Support R.ED Dance Company with a gift of any amount.  FYI...The $100 perks include two tickets to the performance (May 20 & 22).

Tell everyone you support R.ED and they should too!   

Share our campaign through social media.   Send link to other dancers, supporters, family and friends and encourage them to give. ADD- Please support Rhapsody James and RED Dance Company.  Help shatter the boundaries between commercial and concert dance. 


Stay connected: follow us on Facebook, Twitter & Instagram. 



No gift is to small or too large.  All of the funds  raised by this campaign will go towards a creating an engaging experience for our audiences as well as building an infrastructure for future touring. 
We appreciate you so much for being inspirRED! and joining our movement.

<div>""Zapping,3 musicales en 1"" es un proyecto cultural que reúne en su edición de estreno a 3 compositores y dramaturgos que han desarrollado en equipo 3 historias; cada una con una duración de 30 minutos en base a una sola temática ""Entre ilusiones y realidades"". Estas serán presentadas en una sola obra de Teatro Musical donde se une lo clásico y lo popular, lo peruano y lo universal, lo serio y lo cómico. El estreno está previsto para el 15 de Setiembre del 2016 en el Centro Cultural Ricardo Palma. Los equipos han tenido la libertad de realizar diversos estilos obteniendo un solo gran musical que combina Drama, Comedia, y Surrealismo a ritmo de Pop, Rock, Vals y Música Clásica. Donde cada actor representará a 3 personajes. Uno por cada musical. Pueden escuchar partes de la música en el video que presentamos aquí. </div>
<div>Zapping busca desarrollar el Teatro Musical Original Peruano <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">realizando año tras año una convocatoria abierta para que dramaturgos y compositores en duplas participen enviando una historia de 30 minutos para ser producida en una nueva edición bajo una nueva temática.  </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Estos textos y composiciones serán evaluados por un jurado especialista, además de que los participantes podrán pasar por talleres y capacitaciones asegurando así la exposición de productos finales de alta calidad artística.</span><br/>

<p>Es importante el desarrollo de nuevas ventanas de exposición y dar oportunidad a artistas que quizá no tienen la posibilidad de pertenecer a compañías o asociaciónes donde puedan exponer sus trabajos.

<p><i>This project seeks to develop the Teatro Musical Original Peruano (Original Peruvian Musical Theater) performing year after year an open call for playwrights and composers to participate in pairs by sending a story of 30 minutes to be produced in a new edition under a general theme. A specialist jury will evaluate these texts and compositions; in addition, participants will go through training workshops and musical composition exposures to ensure end products of high artistic quality.<br/></i></p>
<p><i>It is important to develop new windows of opportunity to show and give artists who may not have the possibility of belonging to companies or associations where they can exhibit their work. We are confident that in our country we have great talents.

With the help of everyone we can have everything that is required to present a high-level production and achieve this project to new issues and support of private entities.</i><br/></p>

</div></div>","""Zapping,3 musicales en 1"" es un proyecto cultural que reúne en su edición de estreno a 3 compositores y dramaturgos que han desarrollado en equipo 3 historias; cada una con una duración de 30 minutos en base a una sola temática ""Entre ilusiones y realidades"". Estas serán presentadas en una sola obra de Teatro Musical donde se une lo clásico y lo popular, lo peruano y lo universal, lo serio y lo cómico. El estreno está previsto para el 15 de Setiembre del 2016 en el Centro Cultural Ricardo Palma. Los equipos han tenido la libertad de realizar diversos estilos obteniendo un solo gran musical que combina Drama, Comedia, y Surrealismo a ritmo de Pop, Rock, Vals y Música Clásica. Donde cada actor representará a 3 personajes. Uno por cada musical. Pueden escuchar partes de la música en el video que presentamos aquí. 
Zapping busca desarrollar el Teatro Musical Original Peruano realizando año tras año una convocatoria abierta para que dramaturgos y compositores en duplas participen enviando una historia de 30 minutos para ser producida en una nueva edición bajo una nueva temática.  Estos textos y composiciones serán evaluados por un jurado especialista, además de que los participantes podrán pasar por talleres y capacitaciones asegurando así la exposición de productos finales de alta calidad artística.

Es importante el desarrollo de nuevas ventanas de exposición y dar oportunidad a artistas que quizá no tienen la posibilidad de pertenecer a compañías o asociaciónes donde puedan exponer sus trabajos. Estamos seguros de que en nuestro país contamos con gran talento. Con la ayuda de todos podremos tener todo lo necesario para presentar una producción de alto nivel y así lograr que este proyecto tenga nuevas ediciones y el apoyo de entidades privadas.
“Zapping, 3 Musicales en 1” which translates to “Zapping, Three Musicals in One”, is a cultural project which meets in its premiere edition 3 composers and 3 playwrights who have developed together three stories; each lasting thirty minutes based on a single theme ""Between Dreams and Realities”. 
This project seeks to develop the Teatro Musical Original Peruano (Original Peruvian Musical Theater) performing year after year an open call for playwrights and composers to participate in pairs by sending a story of 30 minutes to be produced in a new edition under a general theme. A specialist jury will evaluate these texts and compositions; in addition, participants will go through training workshops and musical composition exposures to ensure end products of high artistic quality.
It is important to develop new windows of opportunity to show and give artists who may not have the possibility of belonging to companies or associations where they can exhibit their work. We are confident that in our country we have great talents.

With the help of everyone we can have everything that is required to present a high-level production and achieve this project to new issues and support of private entities.




El proyecto necesita un total  de $15 600 para la producción del musical. Esta campaña busca recaudar un total de $8000 que serán destinados al equipamiento de sonido e iluminación (alquiler) de la sala de teatro en la que estaremos, además de cubrir gastos de escenografía y vestuario. (4 cambios por cada actor)


Desde luego, tu apoyo en este proyecto será sustentado ante Sunat (entidad que fiscaliza los tributos en Perú). ""Zapping - 3 Musicales en 1""  se realiza bajo la razón social de Grupo Vodevil S.R.L  en la que cada ingreso y egreso debe estar registrado. 

Tenemos una lista grande de recompensas para todos aquello que nos apoyen, entre merchandising y entradas a eventos o talleres; ya que Zapping tiene muchos eventos paralelos que hace de este proyecto el inicio de un Nuevo Movimiento Cultural en el Perú.  
Dentro de los talleres que se vienen realizando y se realizarán se encuentran:
- Taller de Composición Musical para Teatro y Teatro Musical - A cargo de Antonio Gervasoni (16 de abril al 
- Taller de Introducción a la Creación de Musicales. - Federico Abrill (por confirmar fecha)
- Taller de Creación de Canciones para Musicales. - Sebastian Abad (Por confirmar fecha)
- Media Beca en escuela vodevil: www.escuelavodevil.com



What we need and what you get
The project needs a total of $15,600 for the musical production.
This campaign aims to raise a total of $8,000, which will be allocated to sound and lighting (rental) equipment of the theater in which we will also cover expenses such as the scenery and costumes.

Your support in this project will be supported to Sunat (an entity that oversees taxes in Peru). “Zapping, Three Musicals in One"" is performed under the name of Vaudeville Group S.R.L in which each entry and exit must be registered.

We have a large list of rewards for all who support us, including merchandising and tickets to the events and/or workshops, since Zapping has many side events that makes this project the beginning of a New Cultural Movement in Peru. 


Estamos ansiosos por ofrecer una nueva ventana de exposición del trabajo de  artístas (dramaturgos, compositores, actores); en la búsqueda de una oportunidad para todo el talento que posee nuestro país. Perú no cuenta con fondos estatales que apoyen la realización de teatro musical. Con esta primera edición queremos mostrar lo capaces que son nuestros artistas y estamos seguros que con este primer paso empresas privadas a las que ya hemos buscado serán las que se interesarán para apoyar esta iniciativa. Ya contamos con el apoyo de mucha gente que nos ha ofrecido espacios, servicios y algunos productos para que este proyecto pueda estar en una etapa de desarrollo exitosa pero aún nos falta la parte más importante y lo lograremos con tu apoyo. 

Difunde nuestra campaña y que más personas se enteren de este nuevo movimiento teatral. Puedes usar nuestras redes sociales , con eso también nos estás ayudando muchísimo. Y si tienes otra idea para poder ayudarnos a tener fondos escríbenos a contacto@vodevilproducciones.comFACEBEOOK:   /zappingmusicalesTWITTER: @zappingmusicalINSTAGRAM: @zappingmusicalesYOUTUBE: /zappingmusicalesWe are eager to offer a new window of exhibition through the work of artists (playwrights, composers, actors) in search for an opportunity of all the talent our country has. Peru has no state funding to support the realization of musical theater. With this first edition we show how capable our artists are and we are confident that this first step will lead private companies, which we have already sought, to be interested to support this initiative. We already have the support of many people who have offered us the space, services and some products so that this project can be successful in a stage of development, but still we lack the most important part and we will be able to succeed with your support. 
Spread our campaign and more people to become aware of this new theater movement. You can use our social networks and by doing so you are also helping us a lot. And if you have other ideas to help us raise funds, please write us at: contacto@vodevilproducciones.com

</p><p><b>In a nutshell</b></p><p><b>
</b></p><p>11.1/Echo Point started from a collection of 10 plays and a
prologue written by American playwright and 2010 Pulitzer Prize nominee Rajiv
Joseph.</p>
<p>Now, the Drama Stock association (that’s us) is staging a
show based on these texts in an abandoned house in Bucharest. We are a team of
30 theatre professionals with decades of experience between us, both on the
independent and on the institutional scenes.</p><br/><p><b>The play</b></p>
<p><u>About</u><br/></p>
<p>11 short plays and a prologue form a puzzle
that will take the audience on a journey where they will cross different
worlds, equally imperfect, yet familiar. As she crosses from one space to
another, the spectator barges in on the intimacy of strangers caught in a
moment of their rather mundane life, or so it would seem at first glance. 11
short moments highlighted from the simple existence of others, which expose
their whole being, effectively tracing the history of their life in the mind of
the viewer. 11 brief sequences, where the audience gets to play the part of a
voyeur faced with scenes from their own potential lives. These multiple
perspectives of everyday existence confront the viewer with the graceful yet
tragic beauty of loneliness that marks a life beyond all other things.  As
the stories unfold, not without humor and irony, what seemed to be unrelated
fragments of strangers’ lives gradually assemble themselves into a whole, a coherent
journey of an individual that could be any one of us. </p>
<p><u>The text</u></p>
<p>Rajiv Joseph, the author of the texts, is an
American playwright and a 2010 Pulitzer Prize finalist for Bengal Tiger at the
Baghdad Zoo. The scenes were originally written by Rajiv for the One-Minute
Play Festival in New-York and were presented as a compilation under the name
Echo Point during The International Creative Camp for Playwrights from Târgu
Mureș, Romania, in 2014. It was then that Sebastian, the director of 11.1,
discovered the text while reading it for the public and utterly fell in love
with it. Today, we are 30 people involved in the project, and we are driven by
its undisputable concrete beauty. </p>
<p><u>The concept</u></p>
<p>11.1 revolves around the concepts of
construction and itinerary. Every scene takes place in a different room and as
the audience crosses from one space to another, they discover, one by one, the
pieces of a puzzle that can differ from on viewer to another. </p>
<p><u>The people</u></p>
<p>There are 30 people involved in this project,
among which we count 22 performers, a set designer, a light designer, a sound
engineer, the technical stuff and the PR team. </p>
<p><u>The dates</u></p>
<p>The show is set to be performed on the 22nd,
23rd and 24th of May. These first 3 representations are a demo, a way of
advertising, meant to kindle public interest in the event. As the performance
is itinerant, each representation can allow no more than 11 persons in the
audience, so the show is set to have 10 representations per night. Our aim is
to continue performing the show in different locations and cities. </p>
<p><b>Who are we?</b></p>
<p>Drama Stock is a recently formed company that
unites people driven by their great passion and love for the theater. Having
all experienced working in both institutional and underground theatrical
environments, our primary purpose is to contribute to the growth of the
Romanian independent theater. Our aims are to constantly challenge the audience
with the novelty and creativity of our projects and consolidate a platform which
can allow young artists to express and develop themselves artistically and
professionally. </p>
<p>Despite its rather large production costs, we
chose 11.1 to be our first project within Drama Stock, as we feel it best
illustrates both our artistic policy and our objectives for the future. The
project gathers under its creative umbrella artists with different backgrounds,
allowing them to share their experiences, while trying to create not only a new
performance for the audience, but a truly out of the ordinary experience. </p>
<p><b>How will the money be used?</b></p>
<p>All of the people involved in the project are
professionals working in theaters all over the country that have invested time,
expertise and creativity into this project, fueled simply by their passion.
However, we are committed to paying all of the artistic team, as well as our
technical staff for the representations of the show, as we are firm believers
that the hard work of the people involved has to be rewarded financially, at
least as an objective token of the value they bring to the artistic
endeavor. </p>
<p>As for the venue, ideally we are looking to
intertwine our event with an effort to revive abandoned industrial spaces or
houses which are testified to be historical monuments. Bucharest, as well as
many other cities in Romania, has a lot of buildings such as these, for which
small groups of architects or artists are running campaigns in order to promote
their transformation into cultural spaces. Our team strongly supports this, and
would like to be a part of the process. We are currently evaluating all our
options, and will soon choose the venue for our first representations. Updates
will be posted here as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The money we are raising is going to be used
for: </p>
<p>-Constructing sets </p>
<p>-Purchasing costumes </p>
<p>-Printing and distributing marketing
materials</p>
<p>-Compensating the artists and technical staff
involved in the project</p>
<p>-Renting the rehearsal and performance venue</p>
<p>-Renting the sound and lighting
equipment </p>
<p>We will publish an overview of every dollar
spent on this production at the end of the run, on our website (<a href=""http://www.dramastock.ro"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.dramastock.ro</a>).
To show our appreciation for your generosity, we will be offering some great
perks, including show tickets, original posters signed by the cast, digital
copies of our making of feature, which will reveal intimate behind-the-scenes
moments about the show, and many more. </p>
<p><b>Why support us?</b></p>
<p>Our team strives to show that independent
theater can be possible without succumbing to compromise, and that it can
provide an ethical working environment for the people involved. Our artistic
policy is to present the audience with original performances whose construction
and/or subject differs from what is expected from a typical theater play. </p>
<p>11.1 doesn’t need a target audience. It is
meant to speak to anyone in a certain manner, because it tells stories which
could be about any one of us at certain points in our lives. The play is not
meant to shock or to brutally interfere in the viewer’s life, but to raise
questions about the relevance of everyday moments which we pass by, without a
second thought. The full construct is a story focused not on the beauty,
sadness or tragedy of those moments, but on their ultimate relevance in the
whole equation of one’s life. </p>
<p><b>What’s next?</b></p>
<p>We plan to perform the play in other
locations around the country, always promoting an architectural monument in
need of revival. It is our way of making people aware both of the importance of
their history, as well as the need of transforming abandoned buildings into
public spaces that can act as nuclei for communities, through art.</p>
<p>At some point, we would also love to be able
to transform the making of feature we are recording, into a full-fledged film, as
we find it to be an interesting point of departure for analyzing the blurred
lines between theater and cinema.

</div>","In a nutshell
11.1/Echo Point started from a collection of 10 plays and a
prologue written by American playwright and 2010 Pulitzer Prize nominee Rajiv
Joseph.
Now, the Drama Stock association (that’s us) is staging a
show based on these texts in an abandoned house in Bucharest. We are a team of
30 theatre professionals with decades of experience between us, both on the
independent and on the institutional scenes.The play
About
11 short plays and a prologue form a puzzle
that will take the audience on a journey where they will cross different
worlds, equally imperfect, yet familiar. As she crosses from one space to
another, the spectator barges in on the intimacy of strangers caught in a
moment of their rather mundane life, or so it would seem at first glance. 11
short moments highlighted from the simple existence of others, which expose
their whole being, effectively tracing the history of their life in the mind of
the viewer. 11 brief sequences, where the audience gets to play the part of a
voyeur faced with scenes from their own potential lives. These multiple
perspectives of everyday existence confront the viewer with the graceful yet
tragic beauty of loneliness that marks a life beyond all other things.  As
the stories unfold, not without humor and irony, what seemed to be unrelated
fragments of strangers’ lives gradually assemble themselves into a whole, a coherent
journey of an individual that could be any one of us. 
The text
Rajiv Joseph, the author of the texts, is an
American playwright and a 2010 Pulitzer Prize finalist for Bengal Tiger at the
Baghdad Zoo. The scenes were originally written by Rajiv for the One-Minute
Play Festival in New-York and were presented as a compilation under the name
Echo Point during The International Creative Camp for Playwrights from Târgu
Mureș, Romania, in 2014. It was then that Sebastian, the director of 11.1,
discovered the text while reading it for the public and utterly fell in love
with it. Today, we are 30 people involved in the project, and we are driven by
its undisputable concrete beauty. 
The concept
11.1 revolves around the concepts of
construction and itinerary. Every scene takes place in a different room and as
the audience crosses from one space to another, they discover, one by one, the
pieces of a puzzle that can differ from on viewer to another. 
The people
There are 30 people involved in this project,
among which we count 22 performers, a set designer, a light designer, a sound
engineer, the technical stuff and the PR team. 
The dates
The show is set to be performed on the 22nd,
23rd and 24th of May. These first 3 representations are a demo, a way of
advertising, meant to kindle public interest in the event. As the performance
is itinerant, each representation can allow no more than 11 persons in the
audience, so the show is set to have 10 representations per night. Our aim is
to continue performing the show in different locations and cities. 
Who are we?
Drama Stock is a recently formed company that
unites people driven by their great passion and love for the theater. Having
all experienced working in both institutional and underground theatrical
environments, our primary purpose is to contribute to the growth of the
Romanian independent theater. Our aims are to constantly challenge the audience
with the novelty and creativity of our projects and consolidate a platform which
can allow young artists to express and develop themselves artistically and
professionally. 
Despite its rather large production costs, we
chose 11.1 to be our first project within Drama Stock, as we feel it best
illustrates both our artistic policy and our objectives for the future. The
project gathers under its creative umbrella artists with different backgrounds,
allowing them to share their experiences, while trying to create not only a new
performance for the audience, but a truly out of the ordinary experience. 
How will the money be used?
All of the people involved in the project are
professionals working in theaters all over the country that have invested time,
expertise and creativity into this project, fueled simply by their passion.
However, we are committed to paying all of the artistic team, as well as our
technical staff for the representations of the show, as we are firm believers
that the hard work of the people involved has to be rewarded financially, at
least as an objective token of the value they bring to the artistic
endeavor. 
As for the venue, ideally we are looking to
intertwine our event with an effort to revive abandoned industrial spaces or
houses which are testified to be historical monuments. Bucharest, as well as
many other cities in Romania, has a lot of buildings such as these, for which
small groups of architects or artists are running campaigns in order to promote
their transformation into cultural spaces. Our team strongly supports this, and
would like to be a part of the process. We are currently evaluating all our
options, and will soon choose the venue for our first representations. Updates
will be posted here as soon as possible.
The money we are raising is going to be used
for: 
-Constructing sets 
-Purchasing costumes 
-Printing and distributing marketing
materials
-Compensating the artists and technical staff
involved in the project
-Renting the rehearsal and performance venue
-Renting the sound and lighting
equipment 
We will publish an overview of every dollar
spent on this production at the end of the run, on our website (www.dramastock.ro).
To show our appreciation for your generosity, we will be offering some great
perks, including show tickets, original posters signed by the cast, digital
copies of our making of feature, which will reveal intimate behind-the-scenes
moments about the show, and many more. 
Why support us?
Our team strives to show that independent
theater can be possible without succumbing to compromise, and that it can
provide an ethical working environment for the people involved. Our artistic
policy is to present the audience with original performances whose construction
and/or subject differs from what is expected from a typical theater play. 
11.1 doesn’t need a target audience. It is
meant to speak to anyone in a certain manner, because it tells stories which
could be about any one of us at certain points in our lives. The play is not
meant to shock or to brutally interfere in the viewer’s life, but to raise
questions about the relevance of everyday moments which we pass by, without a
second thought. The full construct is a story focused not on the beauty,
sadness or tragedy of those moments, but on their ultimate relevance in the
whole equation of one’s life. 
What’s next?
We plan to perform the play in other
locations around the country, always promoting an architectural monument in
need of revival. It is our way of making people aware both of the importance of
their history, as well as the need of transforming abandoned buildings into
public spaces that can act as nuclei for communities, through art.
At some point, we would also love to be able
to transform the making of feature we are recording, into a full-fledged film, as
we find it to be an interesting point of departure for analyzing the blurred
lines between theater and cinema. The „making of” DVD will also provide insight into designing and completing site-specific theater, which is an often-coveted and all-too-rarely approached form of performance art. We intend to make our DVD as a helpful tool for artists and critics alike. Of course, our ultimate goal is to bring the show to as many breathtaking spaces as possible, throughout Europe. The underlying premise, the lifeblood, if you will, of our project, is the idea that universal epiphanies come from otherwise banal circumstances. This is a boundless concept, and we are hoping to reach a boundless, global audience.Other ways you can helpSpreading the word is just as great as money!

<div>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We are the Glorious Bomb Squad, and we need your help to get our production of THE HUNGER ARTIST in fighting shape for the Cincinnati Fringe Festival.</p>
<p>We take special interest in found-space work and non-traditional performer-audience relationships. That means, in a GBS show, you might find yourself jumping on a bed while a performer cheers you on. You might pass underneath the bridge where wanderers look for the edge of the universe. You might hear a prostitute bite the hand of God. </p>
<p>Since 2013, we've produced seven shows:</p>
<p>Two original devised works, two brand-new translations of classics, three local premieres. (Check out our gallery to get a taste.)</p>
<p>After closing our 2014 season, we moved to Chicago, changed the company name, and got to work.</p>This Fringe Festival will give us the opportunity to get our work out there for a wider audience and, quite frankly, give us memories and stories worth even more than that. We're young and poor and this will help us build a theatre company that lasts. </div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>What we need is actually fairly straightforward:</p>

</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Who I am<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>I can't imagine anyone visiting this page doesn't know me, but just 
in case, <b>my name is Sarah.</b> I am a playwright. How do you know I am a 
playwright? Because I have the great pleasure of writing plays. I also 
earned my BA in Playwriting in 2010. So there. </p>
<p>For the very 
first time in LA, I am producing one of my own shows in the 
Hollywood Fringe Festival! I've worked at Fringe as a stage manager for 
the last two years and in large and small LA theatres since 2011, and 
I've got the very best people on board for this show. I also produced 
several shows of my own work in college, and even way back in Ye Olden 
Days, a one-act student play festival in high school. <b>Long story short: 
producing and playwriting (on a budget) is my jam. </b>I'm good at 
it. I know what I'm doing. I'm not going to take your money and run away
 on a very short trip to Aruba. <br/><br/><b>What I don't have is a lot of 
money,</b> which is where you come in. Right now, I have enough money to 
rent the space (already booked at a central Fringe venue, Theatre Asylum), pay the festival fees, and meagerly create a world on stage. Our budget for all 
of that is about $1,300, all of which is coming from my tax refund and 
personal savings. We can make it work, but we'd like to make it great with your help. <br/></p>
<p><b>Why this play?</b> <i>Hard Sexy Serious Love Conversations</i> is a play about what you do when you realize life can go on, when you think that it's all over and then you have to keep going. I've been writing it for over three years, and I've come to realize that it's a question we face all the time, and it's a question we don't have a guide for. <i>HSSLC</i> is not that guide, but I think it asks questions that allow us to make choices, which is, after all, what living is. </p>
<p><b>Why support this play?</b> Successful plays in the Hollywood Fringe often transfer to local theatres and longer runs of performances. Several have gone on to the New York Fringe Festival, the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, and off-Broadway. Some are being produced in venues around the country and the world. It can lead to more art and more work and more connection for some time to come. More importantly, I am asking you to support the creation of a work of art that creates community, collaboration, and collective purpose. If that is worth a few dollars, please throw them my way. <br/></p>
<p><b>Just 120 people giving $25 each helps us reach our goal</b>, and we will happily work with more (or less)!<b><br/></b></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Have and What We Need</h3>
<p>We have a great team of artists:<br/></p>Director, <b>Bianca Lemaire</b><br/>Set Designer, <b>Katrina Coulourides</b><br/>Costume Designer, <b>Rachel Clinkscales</b><br/>Lighting Designer, <b>Brandon Baruch</b><br/>Sound Designer, <b>Corwin Evans</b><br/><br/>We also have a incredible graphic designer, <b>Mary Harburg-Petrich</b> of MissMaryMary.com.<br/><br/>So far, every member of the team has generously agreed to donate their services, which allows us to actually produce this show. <br/><br/>We have a phenomenal venue, Theatre Asylum. Actually housing four performance spaces in the heart of Theatre Row, performing at Theatre Asylum makes us highly visible and lends high credibility to our play, making it more likely to be seen by the best-connected members of the theatre community.<br/><br/><b>We need actors,</b> who will be cast at the beginning of May, and <b>we need the financial support to offer the actors a paycheck</b> and ensure we have the best skilled artists join the team, not to mention a set made of something besides secondhand cardboard.<br/><br/><h3>We Want To Raise $3,000</h3>
<p>The first $2,000 you give us goes straight into the show costs: </p>
<p>-<b>Approximately $500 total for design elements</b> -- that's any pieces we have to buy or manufacture for the production, including set, light, sound, and costumes. We're necessarily limited in capacity by the parameters of the festival, which also limits our budget needs.</p>
<p>-<b>Approximately $300 to pay our graphic designer,</b> who up to now has been donating her time and services.</p>
<p>-<b>$235 for each of the actors, designers, and the director</b> -- this is an honorarium, and nowhere near what their time and skills are worth, but it will cover gas and couple of drinks.</p>
<p>The final $1,000 dollars will go to paying me back for the initial investment (which, let's be honest, will almost certainly go and fund the next show, unless I break my arm or something).</p>
<p>Any money we raise beyond $3,000 will go into the next production.</p>
<p>If we raise less than our goal, we'll make it work. Raising this money allows us to the work better and pay our skilled folks for their time.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div><h3>Why aren't there more perks?</h3><p>Because we're making art that lives for just a few hours on stage, with a limited number of people to see it, and then disappears forever. The play is the perk. You also get a hand-written card, and who doesn't love that? <br/></p><div> <h3>I Don't Want To Give You Money Here, But Perhaps Some Other Way</h3> <p>There are a few ways to support the show:</p>
<p>-<b>Buy tickets!</b> They can be purchased here, starting May 1:  <a href=""https://www.hollywoodfringe.org/projects/2298"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.hollywoodfringe.org/projects/2298<br/></a></p>

Any money we raise beyond $3,000 will go into the next production.
If we raise less than our goal, we'll make it work. Raising this money allows us to the work better and pay our skilled folks for their time.
  Why aren't there more perks?Because we're making art that lives for just a few hours on stage, with a limited number of people to see it, and then disappears forever. The play is the perk. You also get a hand-written card, and who doesn't love that?  I Don't Want To Give You Money Here, But Perhaps Some Other Way There are a few ways to support the show:
-Buy tickets! They can be purchased here, starting May 1:  https://www.hollywoodfringe.org/projects/2298
Use the discount code SPINTHEBOTTLE for $10 tickets!
-Buy a t-shirt! Our profit margin is pretty minimal on these, but they're great for showing off your hipster street cred: https://represent.com/hardsexyseriouslovefringe-Buy something from my Etsy shop! For the months of April, May, and June all profits are going straight into the show: https://www.etsy.com/shop/Delishtaknit-Just give me cash!

I have a Master’s in Education and have skills as an entertainer, producer, writer, and youth advocate. For years I have worked for schools and social service  organizations as a youth counselor using educational entertainment and games to engage the children and young adults. My wife Salma Brahimi is an excellent chef of world cuisine. She will be the Food Service manager of our cafe. Our business partner Farhan Saadi has the right skills to manage the day to day operations of Upright Theater Cafe and Gift Shop.</span><br/>
</h3>
</div><div>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our goal is to establish a venue to showcase educational entertainment and games to facilitate the mental, moral, and spiritual growth of children and families. Families have very few ways to spend real quality time with their children out in the community. There is no family interaction in a dark movie theater. There is too often just mindless amusement and inappropriate scenes, even in rated G movie. Upright Theater Cafe and Gift Shop is an interactive theater where families watch a presentation (short movie, puppet show, play, or performance) and then compete for prizes in a game show that makes everyone think about what they saw, explore meaning and take it home with them for further discussion. We need to bring more substance into the time we spend with our families. Upright Theater Cafe and Gift Show can help us do that so that we can strengthen our families and make our communities more vibrant. Healthy families make up a healthy community. Our goal is to have an Upright Theater in every small town strip mall across the country.</p>
<p>This project has come a long way but see still need your help to make it to the finish which is Grand Opening. We want to open by the first of June, as school is letting out. At this time we have finished renovations on the main theater, children's theater, gift shop and recording studio. The next step is the cafe/concession stand. This will allow us to serve food and concession items during the events as well as serve breakfast and lunch Monday through Friday to the more than 400 employees that work in the 2 large companies in the plaza. This will provide a strong revenue source to help keep our theater going.  The renovations will include plumbing, electrical, walls, ceilings, flooring, counters, cooking appliances, and initial food items. The rest of the funds collected will go towards cafe seating, a real sign for the building (what you see in the picture is photoshop), an some restroom upgrades. </p>
<p>The perks we are offering for locals are memberships, which include tickets to the theater and discounts on food and gift items. For those not local we will offer digital files such as educational entertainment video or audio downloads (songs, rap, puppet shows, concerts, and short films). We will also give autograph pictures of our characters Mikey &amp; Mandy and more.</p>
<p>If we fall short of our 25K goal, we will put whatever we have collected toward the renovations required for us to get our certificate from the health department so that we can legally serve catered food during our shows. This is amount 10K. </p>
<p>The family is the building block to a strong society. Our family system has been breaking down for the past 50 years. Most will agree that the entertainment industry modeled rudeness, disrespect for parents, and infidelity that has contributed to this degradation.  Now it seems that technology is even further isolating family members with everyone texting on their devices with ear buds in their ears. If there is no real communication going on, there is no getting to knowing each other, no caring for each other, no enjoying each other. There is so little time we have in this life. The next thing know your family has for one reason or another dispersed and you wish your could again have an opportunity to talk with them and share some quality time together. </p>
<p>I have raised a family and know first hand that when we do get that window of opportunity to do something with our spouse and kids we often blow that time on something that fails to facilitate healthy family dialogue and interaction, for example going out to the movies. There is no talking to each other in the theater and the movies are usually too shallow to facilitate any after the movie discussions. Also, if you have kids older and younger kids, the older ones will refuse to go to the rated G movie and end up going on their own the other theater to see a more mature movie. So the family is again split up. </p>
<p>There is so much good entertainment out there, inspirational films teaching life long lessons that just need to be edited for the whole family to safely view and benefit. A quick edit of a few bad words and 2 second scenes and they are fine. There are educational songs that our kids never hear because love songs dominate the airwaves and always have since the start of pop music since that is what sells. Entertainment is a tremendously effective teaching tool if it is used to teach and not to play on the base desires of the audience with violence, profanity, crass jokes, and nudity. Art should be created and showcased not solely with the intention to sell. When this is the sole motivation, the producers will go to any extreme even if it means throwing an inappropriate scene or joke in a rated G  movie just to help the parents site through the movie. </p>
<p>By finding, editing and presenting high quality edutainment to families with food, games and prizes, we can help the moral, mental and spiritual development of our children and teens. Also, we can affect the thinking and improve the parenting skill of the parents. Furthermore, we are not just in this for our business to profit. We hope our model of family entertainment will be an example for other venues, schools and religious organizations to duplicate and offer to the families they serve. This job of rebuilding the family and community is too big for one company to take on. </p>
<p>One challenge we may have is finding content. We plan to overcome this challenge by having a strong social media presence. We will ask the Face Book and Twitter communities to help with the effort of identifying the hidden or forgotten gems of edutainment out there. Fans and followers can post or tweet us films, songs, poems, etc. that they think we should showcase at Upright Theater Cafe &amp; Gift Shop. Another challenge is to raise enough money to pay the license fees needed to present the edutainment we want to present and buy prizes for the gift shop. We believe the income from the cafe will cover these expenses and also we have the support of a non-profit organization called Professional Good Doers, Inc. that will help raise funds for the prizes given in the game show. Also, business we believe business will donate items for advertising purposes. </p>

</div></div>","My name is Kenden Dean (birth name Kent Cloud) and I am the Production Manager of Upright Theater Cafe and Gift Shop. I have a Master’s in Education and have skills as an entertainer, producer, writer, and youth advocate. For years I have worked for schools and social service  organizations as a youth counselor using educational entertainment and games to engage the children and young adults. My wife Salma Brahimi is an excellent chef of world cuisine. She will be the Food Service manager of our cafe. Our business partner Farhan Saadi has the right skills to manage the day to day operations of Upright Theater Cafe and Gift Shop.




Our goal is to establish a venue to showcase educational entertainment and games to facilitate the mental, moral, and spiritual growth of children and families. Families have very few ways to spend real quality time with their children out in the community. There is no family interaction in a dark movie theater. There is too often just mindless amusement and inappropriate scenes, even in rated G movie. Upright Theater Cafe and Gift Shop is an interactive theater where families watch a presentation (short movie, puppet show, play, or performance) and then compete for prizes in a game show that makes everyone think about what they saw, explore meaning and take it home with them for further discussion. We need to bring more substance into the time we spend with our families. Upright Theater Cafe and Gift Show can help us do that so that we can strengthen our families and make our communities more vibrant. Healthy families make up a healthy community. Our goal is to have an Upright Theater in every small town strip mall across the country.
This project has come a long way but see still need your help to make it to the finish which is Grand Opening. We want to open by the first of June, as school is letting out. At this time we have finished renovations on the main theater, children's theater, gift shop and recording studio. The next step is the cafe/concession stand. This will allow us to serve food and concession items during the events as well as serve breakfast and lunch Monday through Friday to the more than 400 employees that work in the 2 large companies in the plaza.

<p><i>Gigue in the Dark</i>,
c'est plonger le public au cœur d'une expérience sensorielle basée sur le caractère expressif de la gigue. Un
spectacle hybride qui carbure à la
sensation autant visuelle qu’auditive, autant au toucher qu’au ressenti. Pour susciter autant l'émerveillement que l'inquiétude. Un spectacle interactif que
l'on ne pourra vivre passivement.</p>
<p>Venez errer dans
cette grande noirceur traversée par des éclats de lumières, habitée par des danseurs-fantômes, venez entendre cette gigue qui
suscitera en vous plus d'un frissons. Venez tendre l'oreille pour entendre tous
ces bruits produits par les pieds de ceux qui peuplent cet espace poétique. Venez apercevoir des ombres,
approchez-vous de ceux qui vous entourent pour vous rassurer. <i>Gigue in the

pour meubler l'imaginaire des spectateurs, le faire vibrer, capter son

<p>Fondée en 2005, la BIGICO s'impose de plus en plus dans le
paysage de la danse à Montréal comme un diffuseur spécialisé qui orchestre le développement du mouvement de la gigue
contemporaine par l'organisation de divers événements publics. La BIGICO attire le
respect en privilégiant
des démarches
créatrices
novatrices, personnelles et hors des sentiers battus. Chacune de ses
manifestations représente une opportunité pour des
artistes authentiques de prendre la parole, sans perdre pied, à cheval entre tradition et modernité. Des artistes résolument contemporains. </p>
<p>La BIGICO assume un rôle de chef de file organisationnel au sein de la discipline
et vise ainsi à soutenir son développement dans la philosophie de
regrouper des artistes qui oeuvrent autour d’un même médium d’expression. Ce qui unifie tous ces artistes aux horizons différents, c’est leur volonté d’expérimenter autour de la gigue afin de s’exprimer librement sur la perception
de la place qu’ils
occupent dans la société actuelle.</p>
<p>La BIGICO crée des
opportunités
uniques de faire valoir sur la place publique l’inventivité d’une société de
gigueurs en pleine effervescence. Ce rassemblement de plusieurs visions assure
la vitalité d’un mouvement en constante mutation.
Inventer une gigue contemporaine, c’est affirmer que nos racines sont encore fortes, que nos
pieds ont encore mille et une raisons de s’accrocher au sol pour nous parler
encore, ici et maintenant. C’est affirmer que nous sommes tributaires de ceux qui nous
ont précédés et qu’à partir de cet héritage, nous créons un langage renouvelé qui témoigne de notre époque, un 21e siècle à la boutonnière. Giguer, c’est un art de vivre. D’aujourd’hui.</p>
<p><b>Que ferons-nous avec l’argent?</b></p>
<p>La
création de
<i>Gigue in the Dark</i> demandera un investissement de temps important de la part des
artistes. Tous les dons sont les bienvenus. Soyez assurés que votre argent sera dépensé intelligemment :</p>
<p>-<span>  </span>Rémunérer les artistes </p>
<p>-<span>  </span>Payer des locaux de répétition</p>
<p>-<span>  </span>Trouver le lieu de représentation </p>
<p>Grâce à votre participation, vous permettez aux artistes de

<br/></div>","Gigue in
the Dark, c’est quoi?
Un
projet de gigue contemporaine. Dans le coeur obscur de Montréal. 

Les
spectateurs entrent. Dans un espace vide, éclairé par des spots, des bougies. Qui s'éteignent, un à un, jusqu'à ce
que l'expérience
commence. Noir. Silence. On entend des pas de gigue à gauche. Lumière frontale qui
s'allume. Un homme danse quelques secondes. Noir. On aperçoit furtivement
comme une luciole, une danseuse, avec des lumières collées sur son corps.
Noir. Un groupe de gigueurs se fait entendre. On dirait qu'ils avancent, le
public doit se déplacer, de peur de ne pas savoir ce qui se passe, ce qui se
danse, ce qui se fait entendre. La tension monte. On entend comme un bruit
sourd gronder. Que va-t-il se passer encore pour susciter l'appréhension? La
surprise? La curiosité?

Gigue in the Dark,
c'est plonger le public au cœur d'une expérience sensorielle basée sur le caractère expressif de la gigue. Un
spectacle hybride qui carbure à la
sensation autant visuelle qu’auditive, autant au toucher qu’au ressenti. Pour susciter autant l'émerveillement que l'inquiétude. Un spectacle interactif que
l'on ne pourra vivre passivement.
Venez errer dans
cette grande noirceur traversée par des éclats de lumières, habitée par des danseurs-fantômes, venez entendre cette gigue qui
suscitera en vous plus d'un frissons. Venez tendre l'oreille pour entendre tous
ces bruits produits par les pieds de ceux qui peuplent cet espace poétique. Venez apercevoir des ombres,
approchez-vous de ceux qui vous entourent pour vous rassurer. Gigue in the
Dark, une expérience
pour meubler l'imaginaire des spectateurs, le faire vibrer, capter son
attention. 
C'est une création de cinq artistes qui sont des expérimentateurs amoureux fous de la
gigue : Lük
Fleury, Nancy Gloutnez, Sandrine Martel-Laferrière, Philippe Meunier et Ian Yaworski.Lük FleuryNancy GloutnezSandrine Martel-LaferrièrePhilippe MeunierIan YaworskiPhotos : Valérie SanginSoyez les premier

Seuls ceux qui contribueront dans le cadre de cette
campagne de socio-financement auront la chance de vivre la nouvelle expérience Gigue in the Dark, la version
0.0, en juin 2016. Personne d'autres que les premiers testeurs sauront où et quand se déroulera cette plongée dans l'inconnu. Vous pourrez déguster ce privilège de raconter par la suite comment
vous aurez vécu Gigue
in the Dark, de l'intérieur.
La BIGICO, qui sommes-nous?
Fondée en 2005, la BIGICO s'impose de plus en plus dans le
paysage de la danse à Montréal comme un diffuseur spécialisé qui orchestre le développement du mouvement de la gigue
contemporaine par l'organisation de divers événements publics. La BIGICO attire le
respect en privilégiant
des démarches
créatrices
novatrices, personnelles et hors des sentiers battus. Chacune de ses
manifestations représente une opportunité pour des
artistes authentiques de prendre la parole, sans perdre pied, à cheval entre tradition et modernité. Des artistes résolument contemporains. 
La BIGICO assume un rôle de chef de file organisationnel au sein de la discipline
et vise ainsi à soutenir son développement dans la philosophie de
regrouper des artistes qui oeuvrent autour d’un même médium d’expression. Ce qui unifie tous ces artistes aux horizons différents, c’est leur volonté d’expérimenter autour de la gigue afin de s’exprimer librement sur la perception
de la place qu’ils
occupent dans la société actuelle.
La BIGICO crée des
opportunités
uniques de faire valoir sur la place publique l’inventivité d’une société de
gigueurs en pleine effervescence. Ce rassemblement de plusieurs visions assure
la vitalité d’un mouvement en constante mutation.
Inventer une gigue contemporaine, c’est affirmer que nos racines sont encore fortes, que nos
pieds ont encore mille et une raisons de s’accrocher au sol pour nous parler
encore, ici et maintenant. C’est affirmer que nous sommes tributaires de ceux qui nous
ont précédés et qu’à partir de cet héritage, nous créons un langage renouvelé qui témoigne de notre époque, un 21e siècle à la boutonnière. Giguer, c’est un art de vivre. D’aujourd’hui.
Que ferons-nous avec l’argent?
La
création de
Gigue in the Dark demandera un investissement de temps important de la part des
artistes. Tous les dons sont les bienvenus. Soyez assurés que votre argent sera dépensé intelligemment :
-  Rémunérer les artistes

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Medicine Ball: Playwrights v. Poets is a one of its kind silo busting festival that brings playwrights, poets, visual, artists, theatre artists, and musicians together for a weekend long interdisciplinary festival. We bring together 7 playwrights and 7 poets and pair them up – playwright v. poet. Each pair of writers is given a visual prompt by a local artist that they have to write toward. Then our ensemble of actors and directors rehearse and stage the plays and poems and present them over the course of 7 rounds during one evening like a boxing match. Over the course of the weekend run, audiences vote of each of the 7 rounds of the competition. While we announce a winning group of writers each night – either the poets or the playwrights – the cumulative winners are for this edition announced on Saturday night. This year's edition is scheduled to run June 22 - 24 at the Erickson Theatre, 1524 Harvard Ave, Seattle, WA 9812 and will focus on the theme of unity.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need and What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We need funds to help rent rehearsal space, buy materials, and pay for marketing. Since this is a one weekend event due to the nature of it, the overhead often exceeds the amount we bring in through ticket sales. So we are seeking $1,300 or more to help with production costs.</p>
<p>What you get in return are a variety of rewards including advance tickets, a voucher for a free drink at the show, a Medicine Ball: Playwrights v. Poets T-Shirt, a thumb drive with the material from the show on it, a copy of the event poster, a shout out on social media, and mention on both our website and in the program.</p>
<p>Whatever money we earn will go toward the show.</p>
<p><strong>Impact</strong></p>
<p>Medicine Ball: Playwrights v. Poets is a community building event as much as it is a showcase for the talents of a wide variety of artists from multiple genres and disciplines. Where else can you as an audience member go and enjoy an event that will expose you to poetry, playwriting, acting, music, and visual art – all by local artists?</p>
<p>In addition, we are focusing on the theme of “unity” this year due to the divisive political climate of late. Given this, we have not only recruited an incredibly diverse group of people to participate, but we are also opening our door to students for free. If you have a current school ID, we will allow people in at no cost.</p>
<p><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Producing theatre is always a risky venture financially. Because of the nature of the show, we can only run it one weekend, which makes it hard to recoup the investment. So even the smallest amount people can donate toward this cause will help.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Please help us spread the word. Share this fundraiser with your friends on social media. Endorse it. Post your own video telling people why you like Medicine Ball: Playwrights v. Poets. Word of mouth is always key to a grassroots effort like this. </p>

<h3>Here's what we're doing:</h3>
<p>Minneapolis /St. Paul is home to one of the most vibrant and thriving theatre communities in the country, and small performance companies are one of the principal drivers of this incredible scene.  But there are not enough places to stage all the rich work being done.  Well, there's a great space lurking right behind Lake Monster Brewery in St. Paul -  a space that Gremlin Theatre is stepping up to build out into a <strong>new 120 seat theatre,</strong> not only as a home for our productions, but also to host dozens of other companies and performance arts groups who really need a space to produce.  You can make a huge difference in the performing arts - be a part of this project!</p>
<p>Theatre should be social -  a great show and a great time.  And what’s more social than beer with your art?</p>
<p><strong>About the new space:</strong></p>
<p>Conveniently located right off I-94 and Cretin at <strong>550 Vandalia Street</strong> and within walking distance of the light-rail Green Line, Vandalia Tower has become a bustling artistic hub for organizations from <strong>The Independent Film Project</strong> to the <strong>Saint Paul Neighborhood Network </strong>and contains the offices and studios of many artists and performing arts groups.  Fronted by <strong>Lake Monster Brewery</strong>, Vandalia Tower features a large courtyard and welcoming patio, complete with rotating food trucks on evenings and weekends and a <strong>tap room</strong> to wet your whistle and mingle with the neighborhood. </p>
<p>The new theatre will feature a <strong>thrust stage</strong> with audience members sitting up close and personal: no more than four rows deep with excellent sight-lines on all three sides.  There will be a large new lobby and box office with high ceilings and easy access to the building’s new and abundant bathrooms.  The theatre will be fully wheelchair-accessible and plentiful <strong>free parking</strong> is available in the lot surrounding the building. </p>
<p>Once up and running, Gremlin Theatre plans to stage full production seasons in this performance space as well as host performing arts groups of widely varied backgrounds, keeping the theatre in use year round. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>There's no way around it; building a new theatre is a huge challenge and a ton of work.  But we believe passionately in the power of live performance and we are dedicated to serving our audiences and the Twin Cities Theatre community.  Great performance spaces are really in need!  We're willing to do the work, we just need a little help from you.  Contribute today and pass the word on.  Together, we can get there.</p>
<p><strong>Here's how you can help:</strong></p>
<p>We're looking to raise $25,000 toward our $100,000 project through our Friend of a Friend campaign.  That's a lot of money!  Well, it's a big project.  Here's what it will go toward:</p>
<ul>
<li>Demolition</li>
<li>Construction of demising and interior walls &amp; sound insulation</li>
<li>New mechanicals (like heating &amp; air conditioning)</li>
<li>Electrical supply and distribution</li>
<li>Plumbing</li>
<li>Painting, carpeting &amp; finishes</li>
<li>Re-installation of Gremlin's lighting, sound, staging, seating &amp; equipment</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, everything to make a fantastic, intimate, dynamic performance space that we'll be proud to have you in and that you'll be excited to be in.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Why help us?  Can we be trusted? Don’t know much about Gremlin Theatre?  Want to know more about us?  Here’s a little background (and why this makes a difference):</p>
<p>Founded in January of 1998, Gremlin Theatre is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization dedicated to providing high-quality professional theatre in an intimate setting, both through our own productions and through the numerous groups that we host throughout the year. </p>
<p>Gremlin has built and operated two different performance facilities in St. Paul: The Loading Dock Theater in Lowertown (2002-2008) and The Gremlin Theatre on University Avenue near Highway 280 &amp; Raymond Avenue (2008-2013).    Since 2013, Gremlin has been producing in a wide variety of locales and theatres while looking for the opportunity to build a long-term facility. </p>
<p>As a producing company, Gremlin shows routinely garner critical acclaim and we have partnered with some of the best artists in the Twin Cities while producing in theatres and venues from The Hennepin Theatre Trust to an efficiency apartment studio to the kitchen of the James J. Hill House.  Consistently named to Top Ten lists, Gremlin has twice been honored with Ivey Awards and was named “Best Theater Deal” and “Artist of the Year” by Mpls/St. Paul Magazine and City Pages respectively.</p>
<p>In addition to the nearly sixty productions Gremlin has staged as a company, we have provided a theater facility for dozens of performance arts groups over the years.  These have ranged from summer workshop programs for Saint Paul youth to performing arts groups from such diverse backgrounds as Teatro del Pueblo, Pangaea World Theatre, The Young Artists’ Initiative, Walking Shadow, The Center for Hmong Arts and Talent, Theatre Pro Rata and The Twin Cities German Immersion School (to name but a few).  Gremlin was also successful in bringing the Minnesota Fringe Festival to St. Paul for the first time and was a Fringe venue for four years. The influx of thousands of Fringe patrons to the University/Raymond area over ten days each August was great for St. Paul and the diversity of cultural offerings that came with the Fringe was simply unparalleled.  All told, in just the five years Gremlin operated our 100 seat Theatre on University Avenue (2008-2013), we served over 35 different performing arts groups, 500 artists and 30,000 patrons. </p>
<p>We could go on and on - but we promise we won't.  Let's talk in person.  We'd love to hear about <strong>you</strong>.  Help us out and then come and meet us.  We can't wait to meet you!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>There's one other thing you can do for us.  It's quick, it's easy.  Help us get the word out.  Pass us on to your friends.  After all, this is the Friend of a Friend campaign and we'd love an introduction.  We're trying to build this theatre from the bottom up and we want to meet 1,000 new friends.  Help us get there!  (Remember, you can always share us with Facebook or Indiegogo's sharing tools as well. )</p>

</div></div>","Here's what we're doing:
Minneapolis /St. Paul is home to one of the most vibrant and thriving theatre communities in the country, and small performance companies are one of the principal drivers of this incredible scene.  But there are not enough places to stage all the rich work being done.  Well, there's a great space lurking right behind Lake Monster Brewery in St. Paul -  a space that Gremlin Theatre is stepping up to build out into a new 120 seat theatre, not only as a home for our productions, but also to host dozens of other companies and performance arts groups who really need a space to produce.  You can make a huge difference in the performing arts - be a part of this project!
Theatre should be social -  a great show and a great time.  And what’s more social than beer with your art?
About the new space:
Conveniently located right off I-94 and Cretin at 550 Vandalia Street and within walking distance of the light-rail Green Line, Vandalia Tower has become a bustling artistic hub for organizations from The Independent Film Project to the Saint Paul Neighborhood Network and contains the offices and studios of many artists and performing arts groups.  Fronted by Lake Monster Brewery, Vandalia Tower features a large courtyard and welcoming patio, complete with rotating food trucks on evenings and weekends and a tap room to wet your whistle and mingle with the neighborhood. 
The new theatre will feature a thrust stage with audience members sitting up close and personal: no more than four rows deep with excellent sight-lines on all three sides.  There will be a large new lobby and box office with high ceilings and easy access to the building’s new and abundant bathrooms.  The theatre will be fully wheelchair-accessible and plentiful free parking is available in the lot surrounding the building. 
Once up and running, Gremlin Theatre plans to stage full production seasons in this performance space as well as host performing arts groups of widely varied backgrounds, keeping the theatre in use year round. 

What We Need & What You Get
There's no way around it; building a new theatre is a huge challenge and a ton of work.  But we believe passionately in the power of live performance and we are dedicated to serving our audiences and the Twin Cities Theatre community.  Great performance spaces are really in need!  We're willing to do the work, we just need a little help from you.  Contribute today and pass the word on.  Together, we can get there.
Here's how you can help:
We're looking to raise $25,000 toward our $100,000 project through our Friend of a Friend campaign.  That's a lot of money!  Well, it's a big project.  Here's what it will go toward:

Demolition
Construction of demising and interior walls & sound insulation
New mechanicals (like heating & air conditioning)
Electrical supply and distribution
Plumbing
Painting, carpeting & finishes
Re-installation of Gremlin's lighting, sound, staging, seating & equipment

In short, everything to make a fantastic, intimate, dynamic performance space that we'll be proud to have you in and that you'll be excited to be in.
We're asking that you help us out with a small financial gift.  You'll be amazed how far your support can go.  If 1,000 friends each give just $25, well, we've met our goal.  
And we have something for you:  
If you can help us with a donation of $25 today, you'll not only have the satisfaction of building a new theatre and basking in the glow of altruism, but your $25 donation gets you access to special rotating Theatre Friends ticket discounts that will be available during our first season, as well as notices on Theatre Friends happy hours throughout the year at Lake Monster so you can come check us out and meet us.
Of course, we'd love it if you are able to help us out with a little bit more, as the difference that can make is astronomical.   If you can support us with $50 (or more!), not only will you get access to rotating Theatre Friends discounts, but you'll be invited to one of our special Thank You events this spring at Lake Monster Brewery before the theatre even opens where we'll get to meet you and say thank you in person!   You'll receive a tour of the new space, meet and mingle with other Gremlin supporters & friends, chat with Gremlin actors, directors & designers, and your first beer of the night is on us!  Come celebrate your part in making a new theatre for this amazing community with a frosty cold one.

<p>Retorika deals with the problem of language as the fundamental structure of the subject and discourse, focusing especially on the establishment of artificial identities, the creation of public opinion, construction of artificial realities, manipulation and propaganda.</p>
<p>Ideology is the belief that the word has real effects. That a word generates an action; only within ideology, can we give our word of honour and be men of our word. The 20th century is a century of ideologies, their rise, their realisation, materialisation, embodiment, fleshiness and bloodiness. In this sense – and here we can concur with Badiou – the 20th century has lived out its passion for the real.</p>
<p>Rhetoric stands on the other side – <b>where there is rhetoric there is no ideology</b>. For rhetoric believes only the word and only at the time it is spoken. It is not interested in real effects. Rhetoric functions only in the realm of language, operating with arguments and counter-arguments. Rhetoric is a skill, a collection of instructions on the use of the means of persuasion, reasonable argumentation, reactions to the challenges of collocutors, composition of an effective speech, coordination of verbal and non-verbal language, correct listening, reading and writing. While ideologists stand behind their words and use them as a means of persuading the audience into something they believe in, rhetoricians do not believe what they say or, better yet, believe only what they say and not a supposed reality beyond language, which this speech is supposed to represent. </p>

<p>We at Opera Fusion believe that the genre of opera or “musical drama” must take on
current issues. For our second season we are undertaking an ambitious project: the
premiere of <i>Not In My Town</i>, a musical drama in one 90-minute act written by Fort Lauderdale
composer Michael W. Ross, based on the events surrounding the death of Matthew Shepard, a young,
gay college student who was beaten, tied to a fence, and left to die. </p>

<p>Matthew's story is one of tragedy, but ultimate triumph for those in the LGBTQA community dealing with the same issues. The Hate Crimes Act (The Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act) aids all groups that have been bullied, physically abused, or violated for reasons as simple as sexual orientation, color of skin, or chosen religion. </p>
<p>The composer of<i> Not In My Town</i>, Michael Ross, says it perfectly: ""I wanted to write this piece because I want people to understand that good can come from such a terrible tragedy."" </p>
<p>To protect Matthew's family from seeing and hearing the hateful members of the Westboro Baptist Church who were protesting at the funeral and the trials, Matthew's best friend, Romaine Patterson, founded Angel Action.

</div></div>","Defaulting on trillions of dollars in US treasury debt to China, a concord is signed in the year 2018, giving America two years to pay their debt to China, but China has no intention of handing our country back to us. 
Why should they? 
Would anything change?
The plot of the play centers on the trial of Miriam Hopkins, who at the time of default, turns from being an anti-American terrorist to an American patriot, fighting against the takeover of her country.
The trial comes down to the conflict between the newly formed UNITED STATES OF CHINA ,and the deceit of a people who failed in their collective responsibility to themselves — bringing about their downfall.



The UNITED STATES OF CHINA is a new, full-length play to open in Seattle on in March of 2016, for an initial run of 6 - 9 weeks.
This is much more than a unique theatrical experience — it's a wake-up call for all of America — and perhaps the world.
Something has got to give - or we may go under! 


The play was originally produced as a series of readings in Seattle Center in December, 2015. The audience reaction/reviews were uniform:

Edmonton Fringe Festival. It became a critical and box office hit and was
awarded four Elizabeth Sterling Haynes nominations, winning two for its
co-founders Wayne Paquette (Best Director) and John Sproule (Best Actor).  Ron Blair's <i>The Christian Brothers</i>
followed the following year, once again greeted with both critical and
commercial success, nominated for three Sterling awards and winning one (Best
Director – Wayne Paquette).  </p><p>Blarney Productions
has continued presenting new, challenging works including the Canadian
premieres of J.T. Roger's <i>Madagascar</i>, Joan Didion's <i>The Year of
Magical Thinking</i>, David Harrower's <i>A Slow Air</i>, Adam Peck's <i>Bonnie
&amp; Clyde</i>, and Philip Ridley's <i>Dark Vanilla Jungle</i>. In addition,
Blarney has presented diverse works such as Conor MacPherson's <i>The Good
Thief</i>, Lee Blessing's <i>A Body of Water</i> (Sterling award for Best
Actress and Best Director), Catherine Hayes' <i>Skirmishes</i>, Arlene Hutton <i>Last
Train to Nibroc</i>, and Craig Wright's <i>Orange Flower Water</i> (Sterling
award for Best Supporting Actress). </p><p>In the 2012/13
season, Blarney Productions teamed up with two of Edmonton's leading
independent companies, The Maggie Tree for Linda Griffith's <i>The Age of
Arousal </i>and Promise Production's for Ellen Chorley's <i>Murielle </i>(Sterling
award for Best Independent Production and Production for Young Audiences -
World premiere). In the 2014/15 Blarney presented its first mainstage season,
including the Canadian premiere of Donn Short's <i>Full Frontal Diva</i>, the
world premiere of Jose Teodoro's <i>MOTE</i>, and Keith Huff's <i>A Steady Rain</i>.  </p><p>What makes <em><em><em><em>Subway Circus</em></em></em></em>
so exciting and important to Blarney Productions is that it marks Braydon Dowler-Coltman's professional directing
debut.  A part of Blarney Production's philosophy is to present originality, and with Subway Circus and Braydon Dowler-Coltman's vision, we feel that this project is the perfect environment for giving time and space for a new and emerging voice to learn his craft and grow as a director and become one the next generation's leading artists.

<div>From renowned Scottish playwright Linda McLean, Sex and God sees an all-female cast weave four sharply emotional intergenerational monologues on faith, lust and family. It is a play that spans the twentieth century through the lives of four women of four generations. Their experiences of family, religion and ambition are shaped by the times they live in and who they live with. Jane, a kitchen maid, the first in her family to move to the big city for work; Lizzie, passionate but unskilled and permanently dodging poverty; Sally, an early school-leaver who tries to escape a dangerous relationship by working her way into a profession; and Fiona, first in her family to go to University and discover the world of bewildering choices. <br/>

</div></div>","Sex and God
From renowned Scottish playwright Linda McLean, Sex and God sees an all-female cast weave four sharply emotional intergenerational monologues on faith, lust and family. It is a play that spans the twentieth century through the lives of four women of four generations. Their experiences of family, religion and ambition are shaped by the times they live in and who they live with. Jane, a kitchen maid, the first in her family to move to the big city for work; Lizzie, passionate but unskilled and permanently dodging poverty; Sally, an early school-leaver who tries to escape a dangerous relationship by working her way into a profession; and Fiona, first in her family to go to University and discover the world of bewildering choices. 







""Remarkable event on the
London Fringe for female artistry"" ★★★★

- London Pub Theatres


For a weekend of May we have the chance to perform this fantastic play at one of the most renowned venues of the Brighton Fringe, The Warren: Theatre Box. And we need your financial help to make this happen!

My name's Anya Kopischke and I've been writing a play called Mrs. Babinski in the Kitchen that follows the story of an old Russian witch who has been asleep for 100 years and is rudely awakened by children trying to perform a science experiment on her body. Going backwards from spring to fall, the story follows her trying to remember where she fell asleep and the people and events that brought her there. The piece is an exploration of storytelling; it experiments with non-conventional uses of song and folklore, creating a fantastically strange world to tell a truly modern and universal story of lost friendship.</p>
<p>The opportunity has finally presented itself to produce this experimental piece at Bard College April 9th-11th. There is a fantastic team of students from of all artistic backgrounds dedicated to the exploration of this project! Actors, singers, musicians, and visual artists have joined together to stretch the boundaries of theatre and discover the many ways one can tell a story.</p> </div> <div> <h3>So This Is Important Because</h3> <p>Student theatre is incredibly important for these type of explorations. It's this incredible thing where students from a variety of majors and artistic mediums can come together to experiment with new things, things outside of their comfort zone, and collaborate with each other. And they volunteer on their own time FOR FREE!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, making theatre is EXPENSIVE, and student theatre rarely gets the funding it needs or deserves.</p>

</div><div> <p>While we have this amazing opportunity to stretch the boundaries together, money is not easy to come by for these projects. And while everyone involved has dedicated their time, we need to provide them with high quality materials.</p>
<p>Mrs. Babinski in the Kitchen is a project that focuses heavily on the feeling of the different worlds it creates. It will therefore depend very heavily on an original aesthetic. Visual artists are working together to create set and costumes that are as much works of art as they are functional elements of a play. They need need money for lumber, fabric, costume pieces, and prop pieces to create a world that evokes a a very specific feeling.</p> </div> <div> <h3>'What's in it for me,' you ask?</h3> <p>These sorts of projects don't happen very often. Not for lack of motive or creativity in our generation, but for lack of funding. The types of shows that make money are the types of shows that are a sure-sell, because something very similar like it has been done before and made a profit. </p>
<p>But every once in a blue moon, something comes out that challenges this archetype in theatre: someone pushes the boundaries and forces the rest of the theatre world to grow and evolve. So many of these productions are itching to happen, but because they are pushing the boundaries they are very hard to fund.

<b>THE WRTE VISION</b> to sustain theater as a viable art form includes the
offering of programs that not only inspire and educate, but also challenge us
as a theater company to move in tandem with the rest of the world. We ask
questions, we reach beyond what we know, and we are committed to theater as a
vehicle for change. To that end we hope to discover new layers in Shakespeare's work through a feminine voice.  In a continuing effort
to ignite the creative flame in young people, we will engage local high school
students through matinee performances that include pre-show study guides and
post-show discussions. </p>
<p><b>IN SPRING 2017 </b>we will expand our reach to under-served populations through an initiative
designed to engage participants in the process of storytelling for the stage.</p>
<p>It's a very exciting

work by Shakespeare which will set the stage for a yet another season of
excellence!</p>

Having covered the initial venue hire and licencing fees with your donations here, the next step is creating the show itself. This will require meticulous planning of every aspect, from devising a marketing strategy, to building and designing the set. However, with firm financial backing and advance planning, this will provide us with the best footing from which to launch our project.

    Other Ways You Can Help We would be incredibly thankful if you would do all you can to help spread the word about this campaign and to generate further interest. You can use the Indiegogo share tools to help with this.
Once again, if you are passionate about independent theatre, then help us get this project off the ground with your generosity, so we can begin to make this impossible dream of ours a reality!

is Prism?</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Prism is a movement theatre piece that reveals
the creation of civilization in three stages: darkness, light, and color. This
incredible production will premiere in the Trinity Groves warehouses
during Dallas Arts Week alongside an actual art gallery curated by John
Marcucci. </p>
<p>Prism holds a special place in our hearts, not
just because it was our first performance as an ensemble together, but simply
because of how much fun it is to experience. It's a joy to see the amazed faces of the audience
as we suddenly create civilizations, monsters, gods and goddesses using simple,
every day objects.</p>
<p>With just a few flashlights, our players
thrust you into the world of darkness, a place where creatures and people
are created and destroyed in an instant as they struggle for light and power.
Then, using mirrors and weight-sharing to delve into a world of light, a man
and a woman explore the obstacles they face as they go on to create
civilization. Finally, our ensemble uses paint to explore the world of color as
a diverse community creates an entirely fictional language, but just as quickly
the differences in this language bring about conflict and eventually, all-consuming
warfare.  </p>
<p>The epic themes,
combined with the simple, minimalist execution, provide a vulnerability and
magical sense of wonder that lives and breathes in every moment.
Ultimately,<i> Prism</i> is an
invitation to play, a chance for our audience members to dream of the times
when they played sweetly and fiercely and birthed the light of their
own stories from the darkness of nothing. </p>
<p><b>What We Need </b></p>
<p>This is a huge project, and with that fact in mind, we've got
some good and bad news.</p>
<p>Bad news first: while your funding will be a great help, ensuring
that we can cover what we need, it by no means will cover it all. </p>
<p>Here's the good news: If we raise this money, Southern Methodist
University’s Meadows program has offered to not only match, but exceed the
amount raised, bringing us to a total of $5000. </p>
<p>Not only is this truly an incredible gift, but it also means
that you have a chance to fund not only Prism, but our upcoming season as
well. </p>
<p>Your funds, along with SMU’s contribution will go toward:</p>
<p><b>Sound</b>: Speakers, tape, and
extension cords so that the room can be filled with Fabricio’s and Seun
Soyemi's original music.</p>
<p><b>Lighting</b>: Lighting
equipment, rigging, work lights and LEDs that will not only be used prominently
in Prism, but will also be used as an investment to make future shows possible.</p>
<p><b>Costumes</b>: We will need to
get costumes that are easily washable while still allowing us to be fully mobile.</p>
<p><b>Set</b>: Special effects,
canvases to fight on, rigging</p>
<p><b>Props/Theming</b>:
Paint, mirrors, paintbrushes, flashlights, bowls, eye protectors, water
balloons, etc.</p>
<p><b>Funding our next
season</b>: We've got a lot of shows and dreams we want
to see come to life, and your funding will be the first step in making those
dreams a reality.</p>
<p><b>What You'll Get </b></p>
<p>Instead of thinking of this as just a fundraising campaign, we'd
like our funders to think of this as a VIP preordering system. While at the
actual event, tickets will be $15-$25 each, we will be giving all of our
funders the opportunity to pre-order their tickets to this beautiful show,
which ends in an honest to goodness paint war for just $10 each. </p>
<p>PrismCo has a history of having sold out weekends, so funding us
now is one way to guarantee that you have a seat.</p>
<p>And for those of us who have been to a PrismCo show before, good
seats run out pretty fast, so why not guarantee that you’ll have the seat of
your choice? At $20, we will reserve a seat wherever you want it, and at $40
we’ll reserve those seats for you and a guest.</p>
<p>The money we are requesting is the minimum amount we will need
in order to make this incredible event happen.  But if we meet our goal
and raise more, we will be able to offer other awesome perks at discounted
prices like your very own PrismCo t-shirt, and Prism Canvases for lower prices
than you would get at the actual event!</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>We have nothing but the highest expectations for PrismCo’s
effect on the Dallas arts scene. Not only are we offering a type of theatre
that is very rarely seen in the Dallas arts community, we hope our productions
will offer opportunities to a wide variety of artists from different
disciplines to showcase their work. For a lot of our visual, musical and
performing artists, these shows can serve as their chance to premiere in the
Dallas arts world, or hone their skills and try something completely new. We
want to make sure these artists’ amazing talents are seen by Dallas artistic
professionals and that they are fairly compensated for their incredible
talents.</p>
<p>Also, because of the nature of PrismCo’s wordless, movement
based theatre, our productions are an excellent medium for educational theatre,
as we are able to present a variety of myths and other artistic experiences to
a younger audience in a way that is engaging, and easily digestible for
students of all ages.</p>
<p> Finally, we hope that PrismCo will ultimately help kick
start West Dallas’ artistic growth as the area transitions into a new
noncommercial arts district. With funding, we will not only be able
to make our company become a reality, but we will be helping to diversify the
Dallas community of artists as a whole.</p>
<p><b>Overcoming risks and challenges</b></p>
<p><b>As a team, PrismCo has had a very consistent and successful
track record of delivering exceptional and engaging artistic projects that
consistently result in sold out weekends.</b></p>
<p>Below is a list of shows we have produced in the past, along
with a few links to our reviews where applicable.</p>
<p><i>Galatea:</i> an innovative, wordless movement show that uses paper, aerial
silks, and weight-sharing to explore the story of an artist who attempts to
create a perfect girl as his one true love. In the process, he creates an
entire world; populated with vibrant characters who help to teach the girl
what it is to be human.</p>
<p>Galatea was named one of Dallas’ top 10 plays and one of
Mark Lowry’s top 5 favorite new works of 2014 (Theater Jones). Galatea
was also recognized by the Dallas-Fort Worth Theatre Critics Forum Awards for
its outstanding movement work.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, My name is Alex J Frantz, Artistic Director and Founder of Antix Theatrix. Antix is an arts organization dedicated to creativity, collaboration, and community. We also practice Fair Trade Artists, the concept that artists deserve to be fairly compensated for their time and talents. Antix Theatrix is looking to produce it's first production this upcoming summer, of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" by William Shakespeare. The theme of the production is Pride- celebrating the diverse LGBTQ culture within and beyond the Fox Cities. As a non-binary individual, I have a unique perspective to offer through my direction of this production.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Producing Theater is expensive. Our total production budget is $23,000- over $10,000 of which goes towards paying our collaborators $8/Hour for their time and talents. Essential to any theatrical production is a venue and insurance. We're looking to raise $3500 to secure our Venue and purchase insurance so that we can begin the production process. Your contribution will make this unique production a reality.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: 700;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Impact</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>Appleton has a unique and thriving LGBTQ Community, yet we lack any sort of Pride celebration. Similarly, we have a thriving theatrical community, yet most community theaters offer minimal compensation to their players. Through producing this Shakespearean classic, we aim to offer a theatrical experience that embraces and celebrates the LGBTQ community and offering local artists a fair wage for their time, talents, and experiences. Additionally, we seek to partner with local colleges to provide design internships for their students.</p>
<p>As a graduate of Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), I have experience producing and directing projects big and small. While at CMU, I put together a production as a showcase fundraiser and we sold-out three shows! Following graduation, I spent time as an executive assistant to an NYC Theater producer and managed a $10,000 theater music demo.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Producing Theater is a risky endeavor. The main obstacle is low ticket sales. We aim to overcome this barrier by promoting the event to educators, thespians and the LGBTQ community. Additionally, we will create a live stream of the performance (on a pay-per-view model) so that family, friends and fans from around the world are able to attend.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>In addition to fiscal contributions, we need volunteers to assist with the actual event. If interested, email Alex at antixtheatrix@gmail.com</p>

<p>We are group of women committed to providing more opportunities for women in theatre in the Baton Rouge, Louisiana area. Once we committed ourselves to making the Red Magnolia Theatre Company a reality, we needed to find a script about women and their stories. After stacks of texts, we finally found THE ONE: Love, Loss, and What I Wore by Nora and Delia Ephron. We collectively knew this extraordinary play had to be our theatre company's debut when we first read it together. The production will run October 12-14, 2018 during Baton Rouge's Women's Week.</p>

<h2><strong>Thicc Strip is a Body Positive Movement</strong></h2>
<p>Women who do not fit societally constructed standards of beauty are told on a daily basis that they are not worthy, because they do not fit one very specific mold pushed by mainstream media. Frankly, we are sick of it. Thicc Strip is a night dedicated to calling this ridiculous notion out for the total BS that it is. All women can and should feel good about themselves, and all women are deserving of self-love and confidence. We are putting an end to ""fat"" being a bad word. </p> <p>How do we want to do this? With a real, live strip show! We are women who do not fit a specific mold and yet, we know we look good. We want to show other women like us that self-love goes further than outside hate. Thicc Strip is a show that embraces body diversity in the most explicit way possible. We want to prove that beauty is diverse, being sexual is not a sin, and we are all capable of looking and feeling great.</p>

<h3><strong>ABOUT COURDANCE. </strong></h3>
<p>Courdance. comes from the Latin root-word for courage, 'cor', which means 'heart.' Courage, the ability to do something frightening, must empower us to be creative. We aim to tell the stories of who we are with our whole hearts. We aim to embody courage -  <strong>Courdance. is courage in motion. </strong></p>
<p>Our mission is to engage our community through dance. We do this by providing performance and choreographic opportunities to emerging dance artists, presenting dance to audiences of all ages through a series of home season performances, site-specific performances, and a seasonal tour, as well as providing dance programming that fosters a creative, courageous spirit. </p>
<p>Welcome to our first season!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>ABOUT RENDERING HOME </strong></h3>
<p><i>Rendering Home</i> is a dance piece that showcases personal perspectives of home and the varying stories that inevitably follow; both the stories of displacement and uncertainty as well as those of hope and restoration.</p>
<p><i>Rendering Home</i> is a response to the millions of individuals with and without, those uprooted, those unsettled, those hopeful, and those seeking what it means to belong.</p>
<p>Situated around numerous memories and experiences, a cast of five dancers piece together their stories of home as they wrestle with themes of order, chaos, displacement, uncertainty, balance, burden, and belonging.</p>
<p>This work has been coming to life since August 2017. Inspired by a combination of her experiences of homesickness and several encounters befriending individuals experiencing homelessness during her time living in Chicago, Courdance. director Kaitlin Flynn Goodwin set out to physically investigate the answers to the question, ""What is Home?""</p>
<p>A smaller interpretation of this work premiered in February 2018 alongside a visual arts exhibition titled <i>SHELTER: Crafting a Safe Home</i> at Society for Contemporary Craft in Pittsburgh. During that time, Flynn Goodwin was commissioned to create a work in Albuquerque, NM that ultimately laid the foundation for the evening-length work that will premiere in November 2018. Since then, the artists of Courdance.  have been researching, investigating, and crafting unique stories of home. We are so excited to share this performance with you!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>COLLABORATORS</h3>
<p>My fantastic collaborators are photographer Richard Frost and dancers Marcella Day, Tricia Grace, Emily Koch, and Rudy Wright.  Additionally, I am using sound from classical composer Tristan Eckerson. </p>
<p>This performance will take place at Union Project in Pittsburgh on November 9th and 10th.  Your support will allow us to pay for performance space, production costs, promotional materials, and most importantly, compensation for these talented artists. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WHY IT'S IMPORTANT</h3>
<p>We exist to engage our community. That means we desire to connect and grow with our audience. We rely on our donors to engage and support the programming we present, allowing us to create more art, pay our artists, and share more opportunities. Without supporters, we would not be able to fully present work that engages the community, while on tour or at home.</p>
<p>Thank you for investing in dance, art, collaboration, and in the city of Pittsburgh. Your generosity allows us to use dance as a vehicle for social change in our city, country, and the world.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are They Played Productions, the team behind last year's Hollywood Fringe Festival musical hit ""Nothing Bad: A Werewolf Rock Musical""! We are comprised of co-owners Erik Blair (writer/director of Nothing Bad) and Thea Rivera (producer).</p>
<p>For Hollywood Fringe Festival 2018, we have a new show. <strong>Without your help, we cannot bring this world-premiere production to the stage.</strong></p>
<p>""God: The Apologies Tour"" is <strong>an interactive, improvisational show that will give audiences the chance to speak directly with the divine</strong> Itself. Live. On-stage. The Creator will offer insight into how the universe was started, why Free Will has turned out to be such a mistake and will even answer questions from the audience.</p>
<p>For over a decade, Erik has been examining the role of religion in the 21st century, trying to imagine how the Creator would look at the world around us if the Creator returned. This production is the conversation that comes from that examination--and it's a conversation that you can be part of. <strong>It's a show built around the idea of you conversing with the Creator in real-time, person to entity. </strong>You can ask whatever is on your mind--and get the answer.<br/><br/>With over a dozen years' of improvisational experience and a deep knowledge of most world-wide religions, Erik believes this show will contemplate today's topics through the uniquely alien perspective brought by the One who created everything and who has watched us all...since we all began.</p>
<p>You can also expect some surprises when you walk through the Pearly Gates to visit the Creator. After all, <strong>when one is hanging out with an Immortal Being...anything might happen</strong>, including to the audience itself.</p>
<p>We have a 6-night run planned for this world-premiere production:</p>
<ul>
<li>June 3rd: 7:30 PM     </li>
<li>June 7th: 7:30 PM</li>
<li>June 10th: 9:00 PM</li>
<li>June 16th: 1:30 PM</li>
<li>June 17th: 4:30 PM</li>
<li>June 22nd: 8:00 PM</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We need your help to bring ""God: The Apologies Tour"" to the 2018 Hollywood Fringe.</strong> Fringe theatre is produced by those who are passionate about generating unique visions and unusual ideas. By pledging to help us reach our production requirement goals, you will be a part of that passion.</p>
<p>In return, we are offering perks for you to have your own connection to the divine. And it doesn't matter if you can see the show live or if you live far away. <strong>Regardless of where you are, if you pledge to the campaign</strong> <strong>you will have your own chance to connect with the Creator.</strong> And you will have our blessings, as well, for all your help in bringing this unique idea to an audience.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking $3000 total for the show--all of which goes towards producing the show and which will cover the entirety of the production. The specific breakdown is as follows:</p>

<p>TOTAL: $3000</p>
<p>In return, we're offering you perks that we're really excited about giving you. <strong>Our perks connect you as the audience directly to the concept of the show</strong> <strong>in multiple ways</strong>. These perks include:</p>
<ul>

<li>Digital Recordings of the Show</li>
<li>Behind The Scenes Videos</li>
<li>VIP On-Stage Seats</li>
<li>A Chance to Be Part of the Show</li>
</ul>
<p>We're offering you so many options because we believe in this show and we know that <strong>the more interaction we can bring to it, the better the show will become</strong>. So we can't WAIT to reward you however you choose to pledge!<br/><br/>Whatever funds we make will go directly towards producing God: The Apologies Tour. If we don't raise all of the funds we need, we will continue to try to put on the production. But the less funds we receive, the more scaled-down the production will be by necessity.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Fringe festivals are one of the top avenues in the last decade for theatrical artists to create unique and unusual theatre for audiences. They are places where artists can experiment to find new and different approaches to subjects and to theatrical forms and concepts.</p>
<p>The Hollywood Fringe Festival is the largest such festival in the Western half of the United States and we at They Played Productions have been involved in it for the last two festivals. In 2016, we were actors and stage managers. In 2017, we wrote and produced ""Nothing Bad: A Werewolf Rock Musical"", which was both a commercial success and award-winning from the festival itself. We also raised over $900 for the production here on Indiegogo.</p>
<p>We have returned to Indiegogo this year because the show we hope to bring to the festival is more unique. <strong>We believe this show has great potential to be successful both at HFF and beyond.</strong> It's our hope that we will use this first premiere production as a spring-board to open up potentials for this show to play in other cities and other Fringe festivals.</p>
<p>In a time where our politics are so fractured and our own selves are so caught up in the social-media-driven madness of our existence, we believe that this show will be an experience that will reach beyond and through all of the noise. <strong>We believe this show can speak to everyone, regardless of their religious affiliation</strong>--because this is not the Christian God. It's not -any- specific God. You are going to meet the creator--and It may not be exactly what you think.</p>
<p>But we believe wholeheartedly that you're going to find this production exciting. Whether you're here in person or watching the recorded production, this will be a Creator that can speak to you. One that can remind people that there is more to life than the next ""like"" or the next Instagram foodie pic.</p>
<p>This is an immersive, interactive experience with the One behind reality. And we believe you--and everyone--will enjoy what we've got planned.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This production is, like many Fringe shows, an experiment. We believe that it's going to be a strong, well-received production. But any experiment may fail, and we may turn out to be wrong.</p>
<p>Moreover, <strong>if we cannot raise enough money, there is the potential that the show may fail</strong> because we couldn't make it as completely as we want to make it. The advantages of Fringe festivals include being able to create theatre on a much smaller budget than otherwise--but even still, there are costs. The budget we're asking for here is designed to cover those costs--but barely. If we cannot raise the funds completely, we may have to make cuts that could impact the show.</p>
<p>The advantage here is that the show is our own creation, so we can--and will--adjust as we have to adjust. They Played Productions' team is ready to handle the challenges of the show and to alter course if we must. That is the advantage of having a team who have already proven they can pull off a MUCH larger cast musical in the same festival settings during last year. But we are also the team that is much more aware, now, of the true costs the Hollywood Fringe Festival, and we would far prefer to have the funds to complete the show without any additional issues.</p>
</div><div>

<p>We sincerely hope you will pledge to help our production.</p>
<p>But if you can't pledge money directly, you CAN still help us succeed in our funding goals!</p>

<h3>Who are you funding?</h3>
<p>Two working class actors who are committed to giving a voice in theatre to those who need it.</p>
<p>Hi, we are Stacey and Nicola Bland, sisters from Essex who now live in East London. We started in the industry at a young age and have been working professionally for 12 years. We both have a varied backgrounds within the industry.</p>
<p><strong><u>Stacey</u></strong></p>
<p>I produced &amp; acted in a production of Alan Ayckbourn's GamePlan at The Hen and Chickens Theatre where I achieved a sell out run. In 2016 I worked at Theatre Royal Stratford East on Home Theatre where I wrote, devised &amp; performed my own bespoke piece of theatre. I was also the associate producer on Arts Council funded Chicken Palace, which achieved a sell out run at the new studio space at TRSE. As an actor, my credits include Suzanne in Don’t Dress For Dinner (UK Tour), Dibs in Santa’s New Sleigh (Lichfield Garrick, Key Theatre, Peterborough, Walker Theatre Shrewsbury, Arts Theatre, London), Ugly Sister in Cinderella (Lichfield Garrick), Finian’s Rainbow (Union Theatre), Hey Mr Producer (Lyceum), Oliver (Palladium), Sorrel in GamePlan (Hen and Chickens), Ensemble/ cover &amp; played Mum in Little Red Riding Hood (Theatre Royal Stratford East), Florinda/Granny in Into The Woods (Bridewell Theatre) Sasha in Falariki: The Greek Tragedy (Lyric Hammersmith), Shirley in Tales of Aviation Heroes (Soho Theatre), Ensemble in Yeoman of the Guard (Tower of London Festival).  God Save the Teen (Trafalgar Square), Blade Runner (Secret Cinema, Canary Wharf) and Show Girl in Bugsy Malone (Secret Cinema, The Troxy). I have been the female lead in short film Best Bud (Sanbon Films), ‘Coulda Shoulda Woulda’ (London Dreams Motion Pictures), Downsizing (Mad Ninja Films).  I was a regular dancer on The Justin Lee Collins Show (ITV2) as well as dancing for Sky Sports, The Katy Brand Show (ITV2) and 1 Direction on X Factor (ITV). </p>
<p><strong style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""><u>Nicola </u></strong></p>
<p>Nicola began professionally acting from a young age with her first lead role in the film “Yellow” starring alongside Ray Winstone, shortly followed by Eponine in Les Miserables at The Palace Theatre. Since leaving E15 Acting School, Nicola went straight into ""Tits/Teeth"" at the Soho Theatre and has since been working on various projects. Nicola has been working professionally for the last 15 years with roles in The Bill, Casualty, ITV Drama “Pickles”, BBC period drama ""Messiah"" many adverts, Short films and Plays at The Soho Theatre, Roundhouse Theatre, Criterion Theatre, Barbican Cockpit and Royal Court Theatre. Recently finishing a 2 month transfer of ""Fight Club"" in Hong Kong. </p>
<h3><strong>The Project</strong></h3>
<p>Both proud members of the NYT where our love for exploring new writing began. Together we have written a play ‘Call me Vicky’ based on the life of our inspirational Godmother a transgender woman growing up in 80s South London. 10 years ago I had a dream Vicky was born a man. It was only from my mums reaction that we knew Martin ever existed. We had no reason to<br/>question it beforehand, why would we. We both felt a huge connection to the story &amp; separately started exploring different avenues. I based my writing on conversations with my Mum &amp; her version of events as I didn’t want to make Vicky uncomfortable &amp; I was conscious that this may not have been something she ever thought we would know. Whereas Nicola, never being the one to shy away from these things had conversations with Vicky, who, it transpired was happy to talk about her story &amp; was keen for us to explore artistically. The journey of this script has taken many different paths &amp; it wasn't until we decided to come together that it began to take shape as a play. </p>
<p>We are eager to generate a conversation in schools colleges and 6th forms as well, and the funding will help us take a stripped back version of the play and work with the students in their own environment. </p>
<p>We are sure this play will have a huge impact on the people that see it and know that with the right team behind us we can work to change the minds of even the most closed in society. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise a total of £40,000 to put this play on and take it into schools across London. Your donation along with funding from other avenues will go towards the following: </p>
<p>Hire of the Theatre, Payment for the actors, Set design, Costume, Sound and Lighting design, Payment for the Director, Payment for the Stage Manager, Hire for the Rehearsal Venue.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal then the money will still go to all of these things we will just have to re assess our budgeting and explore other money raising avenues. </p>

<p><strong>caitlin+dancers and Kaley Pruitt Dance will share an NYC Season June 1 &amp; 2 at Martha Graham Studio Theater. Each company will present one work from repertoire and one world premiere, and you can be a part of making it happen!</strong></p> <p><strong>Kaley Pruitt</strong> is the Artistic Director and performer with Kaley Pruitt Dance. Her work investigates the nuances of the human experience and explores the intrinsic communication between bodies in space. The work spans from comedic dance theater to abstract concert aesthetic. Originally from Ketchum, Idaho, she has presented her work in Idaho, California, Massachusetts, Florida, New York, and Illinois. She now travels between Illinois and New York teaching and creating work on students at Illinois State University and working with the professional company in New York City.</p> <p><strong>Caitlin Dutton-Reaver</strong> is the Director of caitlin+dancers, a company dedicated to reflecting human subtlety and the exploration and development of new movement-based, technical modern work. The company presents in both traditional theaters and unconventional, ad hoc spaces/site-specific environments to showcase movement as a conduit for imaginative grandeur and promote dance as a community asset. The company performs along the East Coast from Georgia to Vermont in addition to its New York base.</p> <p><strong>The Project</strong></p> <p><i>Kaley Pruitt Dance</i></p>
<p>In our dreams we become grand versions of ourselves - we conquer fears, fly to new heights, and live as our most extraordinary selves. <i>“Limitless”</i> (NYC premiere) came into being through a desire to embody the sensations of our dream selves in real life. It came from a drive to celebrate the human spirit: our determination, compassion and power in times of real threat to those pillars of individuality. The score, being so iconic, gave me a new challenge as a choreographer; to take Gershwin’s bold and exuberant themes and expand them into space audiences had not previously imagined was possible. I wanted to bring to life the invincibility we have all experienced in our imaginations. The movement is churning, energetic, celebratory, ecstatic and pushes past limitations both physical and imagined.</p> <p><i>“Like Minds” </i>(premiere) takes its inspiration from the space two people inhabit when they deeply understand one another, depend on one another, and share opinions and inspirations. This space is one of connection, and also dynamic fluctuation that pushes each individual to grow and challenge their world. While creating this work, I envision magnets in that they can have such powerful force unifying them, and in one turn, they can just as forcefully repel. There is a phenomenal energy created by two people who understand one another but also deliberately challenge and question those understandings. What does it look and feel like when on one hand we build something greater than ourselves with someone else, and simultaneously destabilize what we’ve made in searching to really know and understand that person?</p> <p><i>caitlin+dancers</i></p> <p><i>“Gifts for the Void” </i>(2016) is a dance propelled by the idea of displacement: in movement, social context, and between bodies in space. Thrown into the realm of visual interest, <i>“Gifts”</i> plays with contrast, alignment, and communal effort. An original score by Michael Wall includes an intertwining of breath and instrumental substructure, creating a “Lord of the Flies”-type tension between dancers, sound, and environment. <i>“Gifts for the Void”</i> is a constantly shifting arena, moving fluidly between alliances and ideas.</p> <p><i>“Variations on a Ghost”</i> (premiere) draws from the ghost signature: and Edwardian fad that saw its height at around 1909, where a signature would be written in slow drying ink then quickly folded over to create a new image of peaks and curves. This new work will play on the duality of the folded inscription as well as the newly formed image. It layers in the idea of how a person leaves evidence of existence and individuality through their autograph, though when folded into a unique image, remains legally binding as an official mark of their entity.</p> <p><strong>Funding Goals</strong></p> <p>caitlin+dancers and Kaley Pruitt Dance are looking to raise $6,000 through this campaign to fund the dancers’ rehearsal and performance pay, space rental, and costuming. We are committed to our artistic visions and strongly committed to paying our dancers fairly for their professional work. Here is a breakdown of our June season budget:</p> <ul>
<li>$600 – Space rental for rehearsals to create 4 works</li>
<li>$1,700 – Dancer rehearsal pay for 10 dancers across both companies</li>

<li>$1,400 – Dancer performance pay for 10 dancers for 2 shows</li>
<li>$600 – Costumes, printed materials, photographer/videographer</li>
</ul> <p>Know that no donation amount is too small! Contributions of any amount are incredibly helpful to furthering our work. Your dollars will go directly towards the dancers pay first and foremost, then to the other budget items as we approach our funding goal.

Donations on IndieGoGo are not tax-deductible. You may make a tax-deductible donation on Fractured Atlas: Rude Grooms' Commons Series is a sponsored project of Fractured Atlas, a non-profit arts service organization. Contributions for the charitable purposes of Rude Grooms' Commons Series must be made payable to Fractured Atlas only and are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law.​
When making a donation, make sure to enter a whole number without a decimal point (i.e., 35 rather than 35.00) -- contributors have reported issues with decimal points when backing the project. If you have any questions or issues, please reach out to us directly and we'll figure it out.
  In BriefWe are a Startup Theatre Experiment run by experienced actor-creators. With your help, we'll bring a free professional, accessible, and family-friendly performances of William Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing to audiences in culturally underserved areas of Queens, NY. In the long run, this production is the first step towards establishing a series of free and pay-what-you-can productions of new and classic plays built as immersive, interactive, and irreplicable experiences.
The ensemble of this production includes veterans of Shakespeare's Globe, The Old Globe, New York Classical Theatre, Classic Stage Company, Trinity Shakespeare Festival, and Seven Stages Shakespeare, among many other national and international companies.
Bringing world-class, approachable productions of these timeless stories directly to an audience is more important than ever in our increasingly fragmented society. By supporting this production, you will be playing a very active role in bringing communities together to share in joy, understanding, and empathy.
With a successful first public production, we can expand this program to serve an even wider community by seeking financial support through grants, foundations, and corporate sponsors; your contribution is not just helping to put up this production, it is cementing our Commons Series program as a free, public cultural resource for even more communities in the future.
You can make a meaningful difference with even the smallest contribution. Our perks will make sure that your investment is well rewarded; more importantly, with even the smallest donation you are planting a seed to grow understanding and build community.  What's in it for You (and Us)?As an experiment in translating the Elizabethan theatre troupe model intro 21st Century Startup vernacular, our Patrons are of especially significant importance to us. With as small a donation as $25, you'll get priority access to all of our events -- including events not available to the general public (like our Secret Shakespeare Hunt, which guests have called ""by far THE COOLEST THING I'VE EVER DONE IN New York City"").Here is exactly where your $6,000 will go:

$2,250 - Artist Stipends - though the production is free, we are committed to ensuring that our collaborating artists receive stipends above the minimum transportation reimbursement required by Actors Equity Association. As a company, we plan to move aggressively towards paying our artists at least minimum wage for their skilled work; in the meantime, all artists involved in the production receive an equal favored nations stipend of $150 for the two week commitment, including our two Acting Apprentices.


$1,700 - Production Costs -  this includes costumes, props, wardrobe and musical instrument maintenance, a 10x10 canopy for changing area and basic scenic requirements, City Park permits, theater rental


$1,250 - Rehearsal Expenses - this includes rehearsal space rental (for three rehearsals where we cannot be accommodated by our partner, Long Island City Artists at the Plaxall Gallery) and stage management expenses during the hectic one-week rehearsal process.


$500 - Insurance - this is a contribution of 1/6 the annual premiums for general liability and volunteer accident insurance to make sure that our artists and our audiences are protected.


$300 - Publicity and Marketing - minimal advertising, including postcards to hand out in the communities surrounding the performances and targeting online advertising.

In addition to joining our extended family, the following contributions will get you unique perks:

$1 - Upstart Crow - a video thank you from the cast, an Elizabethan social media shout-out, access to exclusive behind the scenes updates throughout the process, and a listing on our website as a Pioneer Supporter of the Commons Series.

$25 - Patron - all of the above, plus exclusive access to our Private Series through July 2019.

$50 - Shake-Scene - all of the above, plus access to VIP seating area for you and a guest at the performance of your choice, and a Rude Grooms water bottle.

$100 - Muse of Fire - all of the above, plus an original sonnet composed to you (or the person of your choice) by Rude Grooms’ Master of the Revels Montgomery Sutton.

$250 - Tiger's Heart - all of the above, plus an invitation to observe a rehearsal (in person or via private video-conference)

$500 - Player's Hide - all of the above, plus a walk-on role at the performance of your choice (only one spot available per performance)

$5,000 - Lord Chamberlain - all of the above, plus a private performance at your own venue (you provide transportation if outside of NYC)

$10,000 - Queen - all of the above, plus a custom, immersive theatrical event created just for you and your friends.

Even if we don't meet our goal, this production is coming in August. Our modest budget for this first experiment was designed to ensure that we can each work extra shifts, load up credit cards, beg, borrow, and do whatever it takes to bring this production to our inspiring venues and communities.  The ProductionWhen we considered launching Rude Grooms' Commons Series with Much Ado About Nothing, we asked ourselves what makes the play relevant today: why Much Ado, and why now?Three responses emerged that have become  the guiding principles of our process:1. Can the events of the play believably take place in our modern world and the #MeToo movement? If so, how might its depictions of gender roles illuminate our current struggle for equality and respect?2. The play's rich explorations of interpersonal warfare ask challenging questions about why or whether we choose to forgive those who have hurt us most intimately.3. Much Ado is a delicious cocktail of wit, delight, and heart: in our increasingly fragmented world, joining as a community to laugh, love, and mend together couldn't be more important.We are led by actor-manager Laura Piccoli (Unhealthy at Batallion Theatre Co) and produced in partnership with Long Island City Artists at the Plaxall Gallery and the Astoria Park Alliance.In addition to Piccoli, the acting company includes Marie Louise Guinier* (Scissoring at INTAR), Sibel Damar (“We Will Slay” at UCB), Dhruv Iyengar (Taming of the Shrew at Ithaca Shakespeare Company), Daniel Kemper (The Limit of the Tongue at The Daughter’s Collective), Deb Radloff* (Caucasian Chalk Circle at Classic Stage Company), Joseph Robinson* (Nashville Shakespeare Festival), Amanda Rojas (Iridescent, Cannes 2018), Eduardo Ruiz (Pericles at Sainsbury Theatre), Montgomery Sutton* (Twelfth Night at Shakespeare’s Globe), and Molly Thomas (Medea at Titan Theatre Company).Kate Pitt (The Way of the World at the Folger Theatre) is the Book-Holder, Kara Arena (The Winter's Tale at Seven Stages Shakespeare) is the Master of Music, Bridget Bose (Guilty Pleasures Cabaret) is the Master of Movement, and Calley Luman is Associate Producer.  More Ways to HelpSeriously, the smallest contribution will have a major impact on this production, and through it, the communities that it touches. But there are many more ways you can help:

  Stretch GoalsIf, beyond our wildest dreams, we not only meet but exceed our initial goal, here is our plan for how additional funds will bolster the production.

From the positive reaction we got to its early form, the rest of the script was written.

LOOP
LOOP began it's life at Theatre N16 in it's Balham days, where we performed a very brief extract from LOOP as part of a short play night. From the positive reaction we got to its early form, the rest of the script was written. From the first full production in summer 2017, to Theatre Royal Stratford East & 53two, Manchester earlier this year, we've taken LOOP up and down the country to great audience reception and loads (and loads) of four and five star reviews!
The story travels from 1965 to 1985 and finally to the present day, covering one family's loves, losses and struggles to the background of the music they grew up with. Combining a powerful family story with the best songs of the 60s and 80s, LOOP is the story of people evolving with the music they listen to.
""The combination of writing and movement makes this a physical piece of theatre which flows with a fascinating urgency."" - ★★★★★ Theatre Weekly
""This may be the first play to articulate the stunted hopes of Generation Austerity."" -★★★★ Manchester Theatre Awards
""A vivid exploration of love, culture and the coming of age"" - ★★★★ Arthurs Seat UK
""A little bit of everything; it’s funny and heartwarming"" - Theatre Things

<p>Worth A Flutter? Worth A look?</p>
<p>Worth A Flutter is a gritty hard hitting comedy. Based on real life experiences and events 'Worth A Flutter' covers hard hitting issues such as domestic violence, the breakup of a marriage following the death of a child and growing up in a single parent family to a mother with mental health issues while aiming to entertain and make you smile and laugh, as from our experiences laughter is the best medicine.</p>
<p>Written by Michael Head, directed by Jonathon Carr and starring a stellar cast including Paul Danan, Lucy Pinder, award nominated Jack Harding and Claire Mcnamara 'Worth A Flutter' aims to make you laugh and cry while tackling important issues. Worth a flutter is a working class story by a working class writer and producer and we feel it is important that these voices are heard and still have a important role in society and theatre. With out your help projects like this are not sustainable or possible.</p>
<p>Reviews for Michael' other plays include</p>
<p>'More laughs from the stall than at any other show I can recall' Broadway World</p>
<p>'Touching and engaging' The Stage</p>
<p>'Michael Head is a master of his craft' Boyz</p>
<p>'Rollacoaster of emotion, Head's play will make you laugh and cry and then cry with laughter' MTM Reviews</p>
<p>'Think Monty Phyton meets Blackadder with memories of the Fast Show' Ham And High</p>
<p>With your help we aim to make this production not only the entertaining to date but also the most relevant to today's society. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why are we worth a Flutter?</h3>
<p>We are aiming to raise £3,000 to help toward production costs, fringe theatre is always done on a tight budget but a little help will go a long way towards costs such as rehearsal space, advertising and of course wages of actors and creatives. Any help towards our goal will help with the production costs and the magical 'break even figure' that all fringe theatre strives for, any profit will not be given to the producers but to the creatives, cast and director that made this project happen. In exchange for your kind donations we aim to make your 'flutter' pay off with exciting rewards to show our appreciation. Even if we do not reach our goal all funds raised will help make 'Worth A Flutter' a show to remember! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why back this horse?</h3>
<p>LAPA have produced over 15 shows and all have been well received by audiences, industry and theatre critiques so first and foremost we entertain. LAPA also feel working with working class writer Michael Head helps tell a narrative that is maybe sometimes lost in a theatre world which is often called elitist, so the chance for Michael to showcase his work and talent in the multi award winning Hope Theatre with an amazing cast is a real honour but also a risk as is all theatre. Not being a huge production company LAPA are hoping to raise funds in order to help pay the costs of the production and hopefully help them continue the work we have been doing for over 8 years, creating opportunities for actors and creatives, telling important stories and most importantly entertaining the audiences.   </p>
<p>If you can donate to this production we will be very grateful and hope you will enjoy the perks and rewards that we have to offer.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>

It is of the utmost importance that we focus on the ethical treatment of dancers through collaborative creation, showcasing the duality of the strength and softness all individuals have.</p></div>
<p>Moonwater Dance Project strives to focus on what should really matter: artistry, individuality and the ability to be vulnerable. The aesthetic of Moonwater Dance Project is similar to water and has a captivating duality.

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<p>Did you see <i>Tenderloin</i>, Cutting Ball’s documentary-style play about our neighborhood, back in 2012?</p>
<p>A team of actors, armed with tape recorders and curiosity, took to the streets of the Tenderloin to interview its denizens - and from those conversations, we made a play. A vibrant collage of our local community, <i>Tenderloin </i>amplified the neglected voices of the neighborhood and fortified our own commitment to enriching and championing its people. Now, to mark our 20th anniversary, Cutting Ball is bringing <i>Tenderloin</i> back in a taut one-hour production that will tour the neighborhood to reach Tenderloin residents.</p>
<p>Will you help us bring this tour to the community that inspired the play?</p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>Our most popular show to date, the 2012 production of Tenderloin captivated audiences from  throughout the Bay Area - but not a lot of those viewers came from our own neighborhood. We’ve since learned that to reach our local community with our artistic programming, we need to bring the art out into the community. That's why <i>The Tenderloin Tour</i> will visit community locations throughout our city blocks with free performances for neighborhood citizens in January 2019. And this is where we need your help: can you donate towards our $8,000 goal, covering production costs to bring <i>The Tenderloin Tour</i> to the people of the Tenderloin?</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Cutting Ball has been making work in the Tenderloin since 1999. Seven years ago, we commissioned local theater-maker Annie Elias to create a piece that would shed light on our neighborhood and on the daily experiences of Tenderloin residents, in their own voices. The result? A stunning ensemble-generated play that brought the vitality, chaos, and complexity of the neighborhood to our stage.</p>
<p>Today, rapid shifts in San Francisco’s economic landscape have left its most fraught neighborhood especially vulnerable. As gentrification becomes an increasingly divisive force in our city, <i>The Tenderloin Tour </i>aims to forge bonds between the diverse populations living within our city blocks, cultivating a more unified Tenderloin. Every performance will be followed by a facilitated discussion, led by a member of the local community, reflecting on the issue's facing the Tenderloin now and building frameworks for the future.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Reaching our neighborhood community with our art can be tricky. Even with our pay-what-you-can plan for Tenderloin residents, the theater is not a space where all people feel comfortable. That's why, rather than bringing our neighbors to see this show, we're bringing the show to our neighbors. </p>

<h3>About The Speakeasy Society</h3>
<p>We're an LA based immersive entertainment company creating intimate and epic experiences in unexpected places.  By crafting shared experiences where audience interaction is vital to the performance, our approach to immersive world-building is unique. Our work is primarily text-based and crafted for a mid-size audience, characterized by our commitment to creating a narrative where each audience member plays a specific role in the experience, and their actions impact their overall journey through the performance. </p>
<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p>The Speakeasy Society was officially formed in a women’s restroom at California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) in 2012. Longtime collaborators Julianne Just, Genevieve Gearhart and Matthew Bamberg-Johnson, created “The Weird Sisters,” a witch-centric adaptation of Macbeth that gave audience members a new and personal experience of the classic narrative. Almost seven years and <a href=""http://speakeasysociety.com/the-speakeasy-society"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">22 unique productions</a> later (33 including remounts) the company is quickly becoming identified as the industry standard for what is achievable for independent theatre companies in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>In the future, we want to continue increasing the scale and complexity of our work to meet the demands of an increasingly savvy immersive theatre audience while offering a space where hundreds of uninitiated newcomers to the immersive scene can have their first experience with the genre. After ""The Johnny Cycle"" we will begin development on a new project inspired by Greek mythology but experienced through a modern lens. The goal of this project is to create a show with the universal appeal of “Sleep No More” and the intimacy of “Then She Fell” that can run for years in a dedicated location. The kind of work that redefines a scene in a city; that can redefine the city itself.   </p>
<p>Achieving growth at a large scale requires time and dedicated focus. This means greater periods of incubation, testing, adjustment, workshops, revision - a process that requires financial, institutional support and partnership. And while we are very excited about our existing partnerships - we are looking forward to expanding and creating relationships with new institutions.</p>
<p>We hope to bring our work to broader audiences, increasing recognition of the art form of immersive theater internationally and in our own backyard, while situating the western United States as the definitive leader in the immersive movement.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>In order to reach $23k, your support is crucial. Crowdfunding will enable us to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Keep ticket prices reasonable (with many immersive experiences costing $2/minute and some approaching $3/minute, your support ensures that audiences get a singular experience for a fair price.) </li>
<li>Compensate our collaborators at a higher rate - as we grow, we want to make sure that we fairly compensate the artists who help make our shows so amazing!</li>
<li>Increase our investment in new technical equipment to make our magic even more seamless in the shows to come</li>
<li>Help us raise enough funds to extend the show in order to reach even more audiences!</li>
<li>
<strong>Donors can expect</strong> access to pre-sale tickets, exclusive VIP content, behind the scene tours, cast meet-and-greets, and more!</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<br/>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>""The Johnny Cycle"" interrogates the cost of what it takes to “keep the world safe for democracy.” It offers few prescriptions or answers, but encourages us all to question our role in the decisions that cause young men and women to fight and die in other people’s wars.</p>
<p>The piece not only adapts the Dalton Trumbo novel, but highlights Trumbo’s own struggle through his trial with the House Un-American Activities committee, a sadly relevant experience in a political climate where voices of reason are silenced as inconvenient to the ruling narrative.</p>
<p>We can speak the truth, but who will listen?</p>
<p><strong>Trumbo's Legacy</strong><br/><br/>We are honored to be producing ""The Johnny Cycle"" with the full support of the Trumbo estate. Samantha Trumbo, Dalton's granddaughter, had the opportunity to come experience ""Johnny: The Living"", in 2017.  After the performance, she expressed that experiencing the piece helped her to understand the life and work of her grandfather.  The family has expressed that the more people experience this piece, the happier they will be.  And that is truly the highest praise we could hope to receive.  </p>

</div></div>","About The Speakeasy Society
We're an LA based immersive entertainment company creating intimate and epic experiences in unexpected places.  By crafting shared experiences where audience interaction is vital to the performance, our approach to immersive world-building is unique. Our work is primarily text-based and crafted for a mid-size audience, characterized by our commitment to creating a narrative where each audience member plays a specific role in the experience, and their actions impact their overall journey through the performance. 
Our Story
The Speakeasy Society was officially formed in a women’s restroom at California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) in 2012. Longtime collaborators Julianne Just, Genevieve Gearhart and Matthew Bamberg-Johnson, created “The Weird Sisters,” a witch-centric adaptation of Macbeth that gave audience members a new and personal experience of the classic narrative. Almost seven years and 22 unique productions later (33 including remounts) the company is quickly becoming identified as the industry standard for what is achievable for independent theatre companies in Los Angeles.
In the future, we want to continue increasing the scale and complexity of our work to meet the demands of an increasingly savvy immersive theatre audience while offering a space where hundreds of uninitiated newcomers to the immersive scene can have their first experience with the genre. After ""The Johnny Cycle"" we will begin development on a new project inspired by Greek mythology but experienced through a modern lens. The goal of this project is to create a show with the universal appeal of “Sleep No More” and the intimacy of “Then She Fell” that can run for years in a dedicated location. The kind of work that redefines a scene in a city; that can redefine the city itself.   
Achieving growth at a large scale requires time and dedicated focus. This means greater periods of incubation, testing, adjustment, workshops, revision - a process that requires financial, institutional support and partnership. And while we are very excited about our existing partnerships - we are looking forward to expanding and creating relationships with new institutions.
We hope to bring our work to broader audiences, increasing recognition of the art form of immersive theater internationally and in our own backyard, while situating the western United States as the definitive leader in the immersive movement.

Our Goal
In order to reach $23k, your support is crucial. Crowdfunding will enable us to: 

Keep ticket prices reasonable (with many immersive experiences costing $2/minute and some approaching $3/minute, your support ensures that audiences get a singular experience for a fair price.) 
Compensate our collaborators at a higher rate - as we grow, we want to make sure that we fairly compensate the artists who help make our shows so amazing!
Increase our investment in new technical equipment to make our magic even more seamless in the shows to come
Help us raise enough funds to extend the show in order to reach even more audiences!

Donors can expect access to pre-sale tickets, exclusive VIP content, behind the scene tours, cast meet-and-greets, and more!


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 

The Impact

""The Johnny Cycle"" interrogates the cost of what it takes to “keep the world safe for democracy.” It offers few prescriptions or answers, but encourages us all to question our role in the decisions that cause young men and women to fight and die in other people’s wars.
The piece not only adapts the Dalton Trumbo novel, but highlights Trumbo’s own struggle through his trial with the House Un-American Activities committee, a sadly relevant experience in a political climate where voices of reason are silenced as inconvenient to the ruling narrative.
We can speak the truth, but who will listen?
Trumbo's LegacyWe are honored to be producing ""The Johnny Cycle"" with the full support of the Trumbo estate. Samantha Trumbo, Dalton's granddaughter, had the opportunity to come experience ""Johnny: The Living"", in 2017.  After the performance, she expressed that experiencing the piece helped her to understand the life and work of her grandfather.  The family has expressed that the more people experience this piece, the happier they will be.  And that is truly the highest praise we could hope to receive.  
“The Johnny Cycle” is an undeniably memorable evening spent in with a supremely talented cast in an extraordinary location exploring the themes of belief, patriotism, and death. It’s an incredibly interesting alternative in a form flooded with horror stories, and I highly recommend checking it out. - INSIDE THE MAGIC

<h2><strong>Why are we taking this show to Europe?</strong></h2>
<p>SF Youth Theatre has been accepted into an international festival of student theatre, and we think it’s a great opportunity to bring our work to a bigger audience!</p>
<ul>
<li>Our production of Gary Soto’s <i>The Afterlife</i> has made a positive impact on thousands of young people and families in San Francisco and Northern California, and we’re eager to bring it to an international group of students and theatre educators.</li>
<li>In addition to a once-in-a-lifetime performance opportunity, SFYT DREAM Ensemble Members will also have the unique opportunity to collaborate with young actors from across the globe in classes and workshops.</li>
<li>SFYT DREAM Ensemble is a talented troupe of emerging theatre professionals, largely composed of students of color from low-income backgrounds, ages 18-24; most have had little opportunity to travel internationally. Since several SFYT actors originate from conflict areas in Mexico and Central America, they will be able to learn from, and bring insight and understanding to students from other world conflict areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>Help us make this trip a reality and increase SFYT’s visibility locally and internationally!</p>
<h2>How you can help.</h2>
<p>Your donation to this project will support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Air travel, ground transportation, and per diems for all of the SFYT artists attending this event. You’ll also help in funding transport of the sets, costumes, and props to Bosnia and Herzegovina!</li>
<li>We have lots of amazing perks for folks who donate to our campaign. Depending on the amount of your donation, you have the opportunity to receive everything from raffle tickets to our Grand Raffle, an original song composed by SFYT Executive Director Emily Klion, or a private concert from George Brooks and the Elements Trio.</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Your contribution will do much  more than get SFYT and our gear to Europe:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>The Afterlife</i> is play about teen death and suicide. Gary Soto approaches these topics with a gentle touch, and the reminder that life is valuable is an important one to bring to a wider, international audience.</li>
<li>SFYT has completed several successful regional tours. We have experience on the road and are ready to put that knowledge to use on a trip overseas!</li>
<li>We are one of only 10 companies chosen for this festival from over 80 applicants. We’re honored by the invitation and are looking forward to the experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2>SFYT is inspired and ready to go!</h2>
<p>We know that an international tour will not be easy, and we’re already preparing for those challenges.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>The Afterlife</i> has been touring Central and Northern California this year, so we already have portable sets, props, and costumes. We are actively collaborating with our designers to make things even more minimal for plane travel.</li>
<li>Cast members and designers are working to make sure they have the proper travel documents to make the trip smooth.</li>
<li>The festival will provide SFYT with lodging and meals while we are there, so we just need to raise airfare and provide some actor and designer fees!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>If you can’t contribute, we’d love your help in other ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share this campaign with friends and family on social media and via email.</li>
<li>Do you have miles to donate? We'd love to have them. </li>
<li>Consider sponsoring an individual student. </li>
<li>Let us know if you have any knowledge about traveling to this part of the world. We’d love your tips--everything from transportation tips to restaurant recommendations !</li>
<li>Know of other funding sources? Please tell us!</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Movement Headquarters Ballet Company is New York's newest dance organization headed by Artistic Director and award-winning choreographer Barry Kerollis.</p>
<p>Our company seeks to bring ballet back to the forefront of New York City's concert dance scene through innovative, engaging works that range in style from ballet to contemporary dance theatre for main stage performances and installation events accessible to the general public. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking $28,000 in donations to build a strong foundation for our premiere season. Our top priorities for this money are our dancers' salaries and rehearsal/performance spaces; the building blocks of our company and our work.</p>
<p>Beyond these expenses, we need to budget money for costuming, pointe shoes, stage management, lighting design, marketing, and media, as well as fees from our fiscal sponsor that allow us to make your donations to Movement Headquarters tax-deductible. </p>
<p>Your donation helps us hire local artists and build dance programming for you, the dance community, and the general public. It also sends a message that people in the tri-state area want more accessible avenues to see and participate in ballet programming.</p>
<p>There is a dearth of ballet programming happening outside of major troupes such as ABT and New York City Ballet. For example: each year, the Joyce Theatre programs a mid-summer ballet festival, where they regularly commission outside companies and local dancers to perform in works created by a variety of choreographers--yet, there has been little local representation beyond New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theatre on this program for years. We want to bring ballet to the forefront of the concert dance scene in New York City, and your donation has the potential to inspire that change.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The lack of new ballet choreography outside of major companies limits audience options when it comes to arts entertainment, and it means local artists are working less and are finding less opportunities to nurture their artistic growth.</p>
<p>By helping us build an appropriate foundation for New York's next great dance organization, you are investing in the future of our city's artists and our city's culture, and making a statement that ballet is still alive and kicking in the capital of the dance world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It is challenging just to start a dance company in New York City, and maintaining and growing the company present a completely new, unique set of challenges. The dance community recently lost Jessica Lang Dance, one of the gems of our city, when the company closed its doors due to the overwhelming costs it takes to produce new work in New York. While there is great support for major established dance organizations in our city, there is very little assistance for us smaller organizations--outside of private donations. In the early stages of building what we hope will become a world class arts organization, we rely on the support and generosity of individuals who see our potential and wish to be a part of it. Without these donors, we do not exist. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Movement Headquarters Ballet Company seeks, not only to get off the ground, but to build a foundation to allow ourselves to grow into a reputable dance organization that stands on its own two legs. I see our company growing over time to a roster of 30 dancers and including innovative works for the stage and in public spaces around the city. We are actively seeking innovative ways to connect with corporate America to fulfill our namesake, and establish ourselves as an organization using movement and dance to inspire outside of the arts, including fields like business and technology.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>The donation of services, materials, and space can be just as valuable as monetary donations. To build a dance company New York City can be proud to call its own, we will need assistance in accounting, grant writing, videography, photography, fundraising, studio rental, musical collaboration, costuming, props, volunteers at shows, etc. If you think you can be of help to us in any way, please do not be shy in contacting us to have a conversation. Your effort will not go unnoticed, and we will be eternally grateful for your generosity.</p>

<h3>About The Founder</h3>
<p>My name is Barry Kerollis, and I'm an award-winning choreographer, dance educator, and media personality based in New York City. I enjoyed a 13 year performance career, dancing leading roles with Pacific Northwest Ballet, Houston Ballet, and also more recently as a Principal Guest Artist for companies around the country.</p>
<p>Aside from my role as Artistic Director of Movement Headquarters Ballet Company, I teach on faculty at Broadway Dance Center and Steps on Broadway, write for Dance Media publications, and host my own podcast:<i> Pas de Chát: Talking Dance</i> on the Premier Dance Network.  I've been featured extensively in Dance Magazine, Dance Teacher, Inside Dance, and Pointe, and have received recognition from Dance/USA as an influencer.  I want to make good upon that recognition by creating a future for the ballet and contemporary dance world in New York City that works outside of the major, established box for strong and interesting new work to take shape.</p>

<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>Crux Of It Theatre are extremely passionate about bringing theatre to a wide range of audiences. The Edinburgh Fringe Festival provides us with the perfect opportunity to do this! Being the biggest arts festival in the world, nowhere else would seem fitting for us to have our company debut. While we are excited for the summer ahead, we are embarking on a very costly month for a new theatre company. We are therefore reaching out for donations to help us pay for our venue hire!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Show</h3>
<p><i>When Dave dies and is sent back to the living, only visible to his best friend Jimmy, It soon becomes clear their reunion is more of a curse than a blessing. Together, Jimmy and Dave must discover how to break down the walls between the living and the dead so that Dave can pass over.</i></p>
<p><i>This comedy-drama explores friendship, love, life and death and what would happen if our loved ones never truly left us. </i></p>
<p>The show has been described as ""laugh out loud funny"" with ""heart warming sentimentality"" from audiences last year. After 2 highly successful runs, My Mate Dave Died has been met with universal acclaim from audiences and reviewers alike. However, we have always dealt with the limitation of time on our performance span - our longest run so far has been a week. We believe that taking My Mate Dave Died to the Fringe this August for the entirety of the festival will give the show it's best shot yet - giving more audiences the chance to see what we believe to be a well-loved and unforgettable story.</p>
<p><strong>You can catch the show at C Venues Aquila Temple from the 1st - 26th of August 2019</strong> (no performance on the 12th). <i>Contains strong language, scenes of a sexual nature, nudity, drug related death and references to suicide. Age category: 14+</i></p>

<p> Crux of It Theatre is a Sheffield- based theatre company that aim to tell stories that will warm your heart and open your mind. <br/>We are an inherently British company. What we create feels grounded in the reality of the UK and this is important to us. Beyond that, we’re not afraid to tackle dark and often challenging subject matter, we aim to make our audiences consider what is important to them, and leave our shows having gone through a range of emotions. </p>
<h3>
<br/>Previous Work</h3>
<p>Bringing together students and graduates from the University of Sheffield, our company members have worked together on various projects over the past two years. They all met through the Sheffield University Theatre Company (SUTCo) but have worked with numerous theatre companies independent of the University, including Paperfinch Theatre, Dear Hunter Theatre, Bunce and Malone and Colla Voce. The company has experience at performing at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and many members have worked on award winning shows which were selected for the National Student Drama Festival 2016, 2017 and 2018.  </p>

</div></div>","The Goal
Crux Of It Theatre are extremely passionate about bringing theatre to a wide range of audiences. The Edinburgh Fringe Festival provides us with the perfect opportunity to do this! Being the biggest arts festival in the world, nowhere else would seem fitting for us to have our company debut. While we are excited for the summer ahead, we are embarking on a very costly month for a new theatre company. We are therefore reaching out for donations to help us pay for our venue hire!
 
The Show
When Dave dies and is sent back to the living, only visible to his best friend Jimmy, It soon becomes clear their reunion is more of a curse than a blessing. Together, Jimmy and Dave must discover how to break down the walls between the living and the dead so that Dave can pass over.
This comedy-drama explores friendship, love, life and death and what would happen if our loved ones never truly left us. 
The show has been described as ""laugh out loud funny"" with ""heart warming sentimentality"" from audiences last year. After 2 highly successful runs, My Mate Dave Died has been met with universal acclaim from audiences and reviewers alike. However, we have always dealt with the limitation of time on our performance span - our longest run so far has been a week. We believe that taking My Mate Dave Died to the Fringe this August for the entirety of the festival will give the show it's best shot yet - giving more audiences the chance to see what we believe to be a well-loved and unforgettable story.
You can catch the show at C Venues Aquila Temple from the 1st - 26th of August 2019 (no performance on the 12th). Contains strong language, scenes of a sexual nature, nudity, drug related death and references to suicide. Age category: 14+

<h3>The Show</h3>
<p>After narrowly escaping the horrors of slavery, Idabelle arrives to the North only to discover the Fugitive Slave Act has made it impossible for her to find honest work. With no other choice, she joins the women of Pinky’s Pleasure House where she is confronted by a wealthy Southern-planter who finds the women-run business disturbing. After an intense altercation in the privacy of her room, Idabelle and the women are faced with a life-or-death dilemma that tests their morality and questions the value of revenge.</p>
<p><i>Fancy Maids </i>explores a dark chapter in America's history with a new lens. Turning the focus away from a plantation narrative, the play explores the lasting effects of slavery.</p>
