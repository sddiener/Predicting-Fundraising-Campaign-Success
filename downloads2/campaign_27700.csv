<h3>AN INVENTOR'S JOURNEY</h3>
<p>Ten years ago my wife Nichole and I (Randolph) had a great idea for an invention.  We thought, talked, and even daydreamed about how it would help people in their everyday life.  IT WAS A WINNER.  To our surprise a year or so later we saw our idea on a shelf at our local CVS store.  This same heartbreak happen twice more before we eventually realized that we were not the only one with good ideas (shocking)!  The same good ideas were sprouting in other minds across town, AT THE SAME TIME (stranger things have happened).  The biggest difference between us and them is that while we were talking, they were walking.  Literally taking steps to make their day dreams come true.  Rather than pout, the next great idea we had, we decided to act.  As as a result, we experienced the joy of seeing our dream become a reality!  Now ten years, three inventions (one in 150+ stores), one company, and a bouncing baby boy (now nine years old) later, we have learned two major things...</p>
<p><i><strong>The Journey Of A 1000 Miles MAY HAVE ALREADY BEGUN. </strong></i> If your invention is near and dear to your heart it is very likely that you have already done a prototype, chosen a target market, and already have several suppliers, partners, and potential investors right there in your cell phone.  WE DID!  We just had to take the time to notice what parts of our everyday life were doubling as a part of our inventor’s journey.</p>
<p><i><strong>The Journey Of 8 MILES Begins With A Single Step, Too!  </strong></i>What stopped us from actually taking that step with our first several invention ideas was the overwhelming thought that the process would take time, money, or other resources that we just didn’t have.  This is true for some invention ideas, BUT NOT FOR ALL.  We have found that in the case of MANY ideas, the use of three basic tools and eights straightforward steps can make inventing something great...</p>
<p><i><strong>...So Easy A Kid Can Do It (AND DID!) </strong></i> Mostly all creative works begin in the imagination: inventions, novels, paintings, songs, etc.  And if children have such vivid imaginations shouldn’t there be more kid inventors, authors, artist, and singers?  WE THINK SO!   Popsicles, earmuffs, the trampoline, flippers, Braille, even Superman were all invented by kids.  We have not had the privilege of meeting these young imaginers.  However, 15 years of weekly youth mentoring, working closely with hundreds of children with varying backgrounds has taught my wife and me that there are great ideas in the mind of every child.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Please join us on our journey to HELP CHILDREN OF ALL AGES &amp; BACKGROUNDS experience the amazing feeling of accomplishment and self-value that comes with seeing their great idea grow from their imagination to the real world!</strong></p>

<h3>OUR GOAL IS TO RAISE $4,100 WITH YOUR SUPPORT</h3>
<ul>
<li>$3,400 goes to the printing and shipping fees of our initial manufacturing order for 300 toolkits (books, journals, &amp; games).</li>
<li>$700 goes to the printing, shipping, and set up stamping fees of our initial manufacturing order for 300 inventor light bulb pens.</li>
<li>Because most supporters will have multiple kids whom they love in their lives (children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, and neighbors) we have created single &amp; multiple item perks ranging from $5 to $250.  The IMAGINATION ACTIVATION Toolkit ($30 Perk) has all the tools needed to help any child see their idea come to life!</li>
<li>If we don't reach our goal right now, we will use the funds raised towards a lesser initial manufacturing order and continue to fundraise locally until the goal is reached.</li>
<li>Should we manage to hit our goal and go past it, excess funds will be used to develop an audio version of the book, as well as to increase the size of the print run.</li>

HOW THE IMAGINATION ACTIVATION TOOLKIT WORKS...

TOOL # 1 ~ THE BOOK

Children begin their inventor’s journey by reading the exciting children’s novel ‘FOUR I’s FLINT And The BIG Idea’ where they meet Flint Gardner, a friendly and lovable 10-year old with a big idea and an even bigger problem.  He has no idea how to make his idea a reality!  With each chapter, he learns a new lesson which gets him closer and closer to that reality.  Starting with the 4 I’s and ending with the 4 P’s. 

Chapter 1  –  Meet Flint
Chapter 2  –  Imagine
Chapter 3  –  Investigate
Chapter 4  –  Invite
Chapter 5  –  Ignite
Chapter 6  –  The Game Changer
Chapter 7  –  Plan
Chapter 8  –  Promote
Chapter 9  –  Produce
Chapter 10 – Persevere
Chapter 11 – The Perfect Pitch
Chapter 12 – Flint’s Journal Entries

 

TOOL # 2 ~ THE JOURNAL

Flint does not learn these lessons alone, the reader learns right alongside him.  In the novel Flint write all his ideas, wishes, important memories and lessons in his IMAGINATION Journal.  As children read each chapter they are encouraged to follow Flint’s example of journaling their ideas and lessons just as he does.
 

TOOL # 3 ~ THE GAME

As the book comes to its climax (spoiler alert) children are delighted to discover that Flint’s BIG idea is actually a game designed to help them put into practice the lessons learned in the novel.   It is the same game in the Imagination Activation Toolkit.  ‘PERFECT PITCH’ enhances player’s creativity, cooperation, memory, and prioritization skills.  Not to mention it’s FUN!

Mastering these skills lays the foundation for, among others, learning to read, write, problem solve and ultimately navigate the world around them. Studies have shown that providing children with puzzles and tangible educational toys during early childhood development has long-reaching beneficial cognitive effects. The challenge however lies in providing activities that are fun, engaging and beneficial for a child. Furthermore, knowing how to foster and encourage vital mental and physical skills development outside of the digital world is becoming ever more difficult.  Our Mats facilitate the development of creativity and imagination, which when coupled with problem solving enables innovation and builds confidence!  What’s unique about Nimuno Mats is its ability to train a young child’s mind to move from 2D to 3D visual perception through its interchangeable puzzle-lock system. Problem solving is key for accurate shape alignment which is trickier than it seems. The puzzle pieces only align properly when in the correct orientation. This means the tiles need to be flipped and rotated until correct alignment is achieved, making it a fun challenge for adults and children alike which should not be underestimated! ""You see Dad!

<h3>​​<strong>Some Challenges</strong>
</h3>
<p><u><strong>Challenge #1</strong></u></p>
<ul><li><p>Reaching the women who need it most.  It was very evident with these candid conversations that helping <strong>women with their own businesses who are struggling and cannot afford the cost of training is necessary.  Many simply can't afford relevant training because their businesses are struggling to earn profits</strong>.</p></li></ul>

<p><strong><u>Challenge #2</u></strong>​</p>
<ul><li><p><strong>Spreading the word about why educating women in these five areas of vulnerability will transform communities, cities and the world.  </strong>Research shows that when women solve these 5 areas of vulnerability they reinvest in their community, city and beyond.  Gender equality depends on women receiving the right training.  Due to out of date content, an increase of ""free training"" that doesn't give all the important details to create success, and women being inclined to re-invent the wheel on their own, women are stuck and not moving forward.  The upside of this is that when these 5 areas become strengths through relevant and current training, women re-invest in their community, city and beyond increasing the global GDP and more importantly transforming our generations to come.</p></li></ul>
<p><strong><u>Challenge #3</u></strong></p>
<ul><li><p><strong>Reaching the women in corporate who want the training but they can't get their corporation to pay for it.</strong> Many women in corporate are eager to learn so they can leverage and rise up, and they need help too.  Many corporations polled believe that they are gender inclusive, yet the studies show otherwise.  This is a cycle that needs to be addressed so that employee retention, engagement and larger goals can be achieved.</p></li></ul>
<p><strong>That is why this campaign will help fund the implementation of working hands to make all this happen while increasing production and support levels.</strong></p>
<h2><strong>The 5 Proven Areas of Vulnerability Women Are Struggling With: </strong></h2>
<p><strong>We Call Core Competency Pillars For Success</strong></p>
<p><strong>Mindset -</strong> The moment you learn how to train your thinking, is the moment you are able to choose your results. Women struggle daily with believing in themselves and we can help positively change this for the better.  </p>
<p><strong>Communication -</strong> Success is not the absence of conflict; it is the ability to handle conflict with successful communication. Communication isn't something that is taught, it's expected.  That's why learning how to handle situations is imperative for negotiations and progress.</p>
<p><strong>Financial Literacy - </strong>Financial freedom is within reach when you understand the foundational principles. Money conversations and financial requirements are often swept under the rug for fear of not knowing.  Learning how to manage money begins with women mentoring women.</p>
<p><strong>Sales</strong> - To rise up the corporate ladder or charge your value, the art of selling  has to be understood.  Learning how to sell and understand your value proposition is imperative to economic change and happiness.</p>
<p><strong>Technology</strong> - A must have in our global economy, yet an underperforming area with women of all ages. We're taking the scary out of tech so women connect and leverage themselves to reach the heights we know they can.</p>

<h3>Get To Know Us</h3>
<p><a href=""https://www.wealthywomanwarrior.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wealthy Woman Warrior™</a> CEO &amp; Founder Andrea Carter has spent the past year speaking with almost 300 women.  Through the research, why gender parity is the hot topic and the lack of actionable results, comes her new online leadership training platform – Wealthy Woman Warrior™.</p>
<p>Andrea is an award-winning business coach for corporate women and entrepreneurs. Last year she started listening to the stories of hundreds of women and found that there was <strong>one common mistake being made and 5 areas of vulnerability, that if changed would help end gender inequality. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The one common mistake </strong>– women are still trying to do it all, be it all, and have it all - by going it alone. Women are trying to move the needle on their own, and it's not working. There is a huge lack of collaboration and collaborative platforms that are accessible during the times women are able to connect.</p>
<p><strong>The 5 areas of vulnerability</strong> - Mindset, Communication,  Financial Literacy, Sales and Technology</p>
<p>Each one of the women who shared her story with Andrea conveyed how she lacked current training, relevant for tomorrow's world, to help her reach her economic potential.  Many sited that if they had one place where they could just get current training online they'd be able to either make an impact on their business or rise up the corporate ladder.</p>
<p>Andrea looked at the statistics for North America as a starting place.  What was revealed was that only 2% of women-run business are earning seven figures and 3% are earning 500K according to 2016 State of Women-Owned Businesses by America Express OPEN.</p>
<p>Many Canadian TSX-listed companies that claim inclusivity still report less than 15% of women holding executive office.  To date, no one in Canada is talking about the women who are continually being pushed out of corporate, increasing the number of women entrepreneurs, yet decreasing earnings and it's significantly impacting the Canadian economy.</p>
<p>Although the Canadian government set a target that by 2019, women would make up at least 40% of all appointments to evert provincial board and agency, we've had marginal decreases from 2015-2016.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512416053/tvj4hg1k6lakhipzamls.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Research shows that when women become knowledgeable in the 5 main areas of vulnerability: mindset, communication, financial literacy, sales and technology, she'll have the tools for success in corporate and entrepreneurship. All facets of Wealthy Woman Warrior™ focus on these areas of vulnerability because we want to transition them into areas of empowerment so women <i>thrive</i> instead of <i>survive</i>.</p>
<p>""What happened to me from these conversations is my heart broke with each one.  Listening to the real stories, the businesses that were 'failing', the mortgages that were in trouble trying to make their business grow, the applications for loans that were denied, the women in corporate being pushed out at senior levels, the stories were not only shocking they were gut-wrenching.  I quickly realized that something had to change and these issues needed to be addressed on a much larger scale.</p>
<p>It wasn't just that women need to stop trying to do it all and be it all - all on their own, they need relevant training.  Training that isn't offered in the educational systems! Training in the online space, because that's where we're moving to and where it's easily accessible, so that no matter who you are or where you are in the world you can gain access.</p>
<p>Plus, more now than ever, women need support.  Not just video support, they need access to real women who've been there and done it and are actually in a video meeting to answer questions or lend support.  Women want to be mentored by women.</p>
<p>Knowing my area of expertise is in mindset and understanding that there are four other areas of vulnerability, I decided to research.  I spent time with other women who were already making a difference in those areas with their own work.  Then we collaborated bringing everyone together, creating products that were tested in the market and rolling them out one at a time, together as a massive collaboration.</p>
<p>Together we're walking beside each other, arm in arm, shoulder to shoulder.  We've got support meetings in place every day of the week to help women rise up.  Together, I believe we can make our goal of helping 1 million women reach their economic potential by 2025."" ~Andrea Carter</p>

Mindset - The moment you learn how to train your thinking, is the moment you are able to choose your results. Women struggle daily with believing in themselves and we can help positively change this for the better.  
Communication - Success is not the absence of conflict; it is the ability to handle conflict with successful communication. Communication isn't something that is taught, it's expected.  That's why learning how to handle situations is imperative for negotiations and progress.
Financial Literacy - Financial freedom is within reach when you understand the foundational principles. Money conversations and financial requirements are often swept under the rug for fear of not knowing.  Learning how to manage money begins with women mentoring women.
Sales - To rise up the corporate ladder or charge your value, the art of selling  has to be understood.  Learning how to sell and understand your value proposition is imperative to economic change and happiness.
Technology - A must have in our global economy, yet an underperforming area with women of all ages. We're taking the scary out of tech so women connect and leverage themselves to reach the heights we know they can.
 

Get To Know Us
Wealthy Woman Warrior™ CEO & Founder Andrea Carter has spent the past year speaking with almost 300 women.  Through the research, why gender parity is the hot topic and the lack of actionable results, comes her new online leadership training platform – Wealthy Woman Warrior™.
Andrea is an award-winning business coach for corporate women and entrepreneurs. Last year she started listening to the stories of hundreds of women and found that there was one common mistake being made and 5 areas of vulnerability, that if changed would help end gender inequality. 
The one common mistake – women are still trying to do it all, be it all, and have it all - by going it alone. Women are trying to move the needle on their own, and it's not working. There is a huge lack of collaboration and collaborative platforms that are accessible during the times women are able to connect.
The 5 areas of vulnerability - Mindset, Communication,  Financial Literacy, Sales and Technology
Each one of the women who shared her story with Andrea conveyed how she lacked current training, relevant for tomorrow's world, to help her reach her economic potential.  Many sited that if they had one place where they could just get current training online they'd be able to either make an impact on their business or rise up the corporate ladder.
Andrea looked at the statistics for North America as a starting place.  What was revealed was that only 2% of women-run business are earning seven figures and 3% are earning 500K according to 2016 State of Women-Owned Businesses by America Express OPEN.
Many Canadian TSX-listed companies that claim inclusivity still report less than 15% of women holding executive office.  To date, no one in Canada is talking about the women who are continually being pushed out of corporate, increasing the number of women entrepreneurs, yet decreasing earnings and it's significantly impacting the Canadian economy.
Although the Canadian government set a target that by 2019, women would make up at least 40% of all appointments to evert provincial board and agency, we've had marginal decreases from 2015-2016.

Research shows that when women become knowledgeable in the 5 main areas of vulnerability: mindset, communication, financial literacy, sales and technology, she'll have the tools for success in corporate and entrepreneurship. All facets of Wealthy Woman Warrior™ focus on these areas of vulnerability because we want to transition them into areas of empowerment so women thrive instead of survive.
""What happened to me from these conversations is my heart broke with each one.  Listening to the real stories, the businesses that were 'failing', the mortgages that were in trouble trying to make their business grow, the applications for loans that were denied, the women in corporate being pushed out at senior levels, the stories were not only shocking they were gut-wrenching.  I quickly realized that something had to change and these issues needed to be addressed on a much larger scale.
It wasn't just that women need to stop trying to do it all and be it all - all on their own, they need relevant training.  Training that isn't offered in the educational systems! Training in the online space, because that's where we're moving to and where it's easily accessible, so that no matter who you are or where you are in the world you can gain access.
Plus, more now than ever, women need support.  Not just video support, they need access to real women who've been there and done it and are actually in a video meeting to answer questions or lend support.  Women want to be mentored by women.
Knowing my area of expertise is in mindset and understanding that there are four other areas of vulnerability, I decided to research.  I spent time with other women who were already making a difference in those areas with their own work.  Then we collaborated bringing everyone together, creating products that were tested in the market and rolling them out one at a time, together as a massive collaboration.
Together we're walking beside each other, arm in arm, shoulder to shoulder.  We've got support meetings in place every day of the week to help women rise up.  Together, I believe we can make our goal of helping 1 million women reach their economic potential by 2025."" ~Andrea Carter

CEO & Founder Andrea Carter is the visionary leading the Wealthy Woman Warrior™ movement, she embraces collaboration and celebrates the talented women walking beside her. Andrea not only holds her degree in psychology; certificates in executive coaching and leadership development but also has 15 years of experience in the field.

<p>One of the most frustrating things about being an entrepreneur is...<i>no one really tells you how to do it!</i> Whether you're building a side hustle, a creative passion project, a non-profit or the next tech giant, the secret codes feel locked up somewhere at MIT or Google.

<div>Hello! My name is <b>Professor Qwbli</b> and I need your help in transforming education by harnessing the Power of Play!</div>

<div>A little more than a million years ago, I set out from my planet, <b>Qeslora</b>, on an adventure throughout the galaxy and when I got to Earth, I decided to stay here for a while since what I found was utterly fascinating.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>On Qeslora, we play ALL the time and in the process, we learn. Here, you divide this into two separate categories. I find that puzzling. Then again, our Elders thought that way once.

<div><br/></div><div>My purpose here is to play. Education lies at the core of any and all solutions to issues that plague our collective future. As the lead teacher on my planet, I have been asked to stay to work with students, teachers and parents to offer some help and guidance.<br/>

Hello! My name is Professor Qwbli and I need your help in transforming education by harnessing the Power of Play!

A little more than a million years ago, I set out from my planet, Qeslora, on an adventure throughout the galaxy and when I got to Earth, I decided to stay here for a while since what I found was utterly fascinating.

On Qeslora, we play ALL the time and in the process, we learn. Here, you divide this into two separate categories. I find that puzzling. Then again, our Elders thought that way once. It wasn’t until they understood the Power of Play that we evolved into the higher beings we are today.

In the words of your Kay Redfield Jamison & Joseph Chilton Pearce: 




My purpose here is to play. Education lies at the core of any and all solutions to issues that plague our collective future. As the lead teacher on my planet, I have been asked to stay to work with students, teachers and parents to offer some help and guidance.
With Play With Purpose, I am establishing play-based learning centers across planet Earth, harnessing The Power of Play through screen-free games. I shall call them Professor Qwbli’s Play-Based Learning Centers & Qeslora Intergalactic Museum & Space Shops. Great name, huh? Here, among other things, we will help to develop tomorrow’s great thinkers, problem-solvers and leaders that will lead us to success within classrooms, homes, communities, the planet, and ultimately the entire galaxy.We want this space to include a studio to produce online professional development workshops, webinars & podcasts, as well as special place exclusively for teachers. Learn more about these below.The first Professor Qwbli's Play-Based Learning Center will be located in beautiful Traverse City, Michigan this summer! Get ready to play, Northern Michigan!



The space will be used to host play-based after-school programs & camps, teacher workshops and events such as Family Game Nights and Parent Institutes, plus much more (check out our mock schedule below.) 
The space will also have a retail storefront that will feature The Qeslora Intergalactic Museum & Space Shop. The shop will sell Qeslora artifacts, memorabilia, souvenirs, as well as screen-free games from across the galaxy. This campaign was launched specifically to utilize the space's flexibility. The funds from this campaign will be used to build a studio to produce our online professional development workshops, as well as FREE webinars and podcasts. 


Teachers (and others) from around the world will be able to access our professional development workshops for continuing education credit via The Play With Purpose Academy, which is a partnership with Teachable. Our free webinars & podcasts will further our reach, as well as advance the play-based learning movement.
Perhaps the most exciting space within Professor Qwbli's is Q's Teacher's Lounge! Since we hold teachers in such high esteem, we are designating a special free space just for them: Q's Teacher's Lounge & Resource Center, where they can collaborate with Professor Qwbli, Play With Purpose and their colleagues, as well as discover play-based learning resources for their classrooms - or simply hang out and knock out some lesson plans or grab some coffee with a colleague.

Over the past seven years, Play With Purpose has become the leader in play-based learning. We have worked with thousands of teachers, students and parents across the country using screen-free games to strengthen the cognitive abilities of our students.

We have done so through innovative after-school enrichment programs, including our Young Inventor and Young Authors Workshops, camps, effective professional development workshops, as well as events such as our Family Game Night.

Each game we use within our programs, workshops and events has been vetted and hand-picked by our network of Contributing Teachers who are using the games within their classrooms across the country.

We are extremely excited to open the galaxy's first play-based learning center with Professor Qwbli! It is truly an honor to have been chosen as his earthly education partner!






Through this space, we will help students build, develop & strengthen critical cognitive abilities while laughing and having a blast with their peers! Shhh! They don’t need to know that they are developing important skills that will lead them to a lifetime of success!

Parents will LOVE Professor Qwbli’s! Not only for our student programs, camps & events, but also because they will discover new ways to connect as a family.

Our events, brain lunch, B. SHARP senior programs and game store will help the community not only learn more about the importance of play, but we will also provide them ways to keep their brains fit at any age!

After years of test taking, rote memorization and excessive assignments, these children are losing the confidence to speak English. What’s even worse, is that the way they are learning English makes them feel frustrated and disgusted with the language. These negative feelings and poor language ability have influenced their understanding of the western world, even generated prejudice against the western culture and values.  </p><p>There are many great English education groups in China, but they are not paying enough attention to the students in underdeveloped areas.China has more than 560 million rural people and over 1600 counties. What we are doing is to help these rural children with their language learning struggle. We want to get them out of the fear for English, to expand the limits of their language, and to know more about the world. And we need your help.</p><h2>Who are we？</h2><p>We are Dreamkids, a start-up English school built in 2018, based in Sishui, a small town in Shandong province in China.

After years of test taking, rote memorization and excessive assignments, these children are losing the confidence to speak English. What’s even worse, is that the way they are learning English makes them feel frustrated and disgusted with the language. These negative feelings and poor language ability have influenced their understanding of the western world, even generated prejudice against the western culture and values.  There are many great English education groups in China, but they are not paying enough attention to the students in underdeveloped areas.China has more than 560 million rural people and over 1600 counties. What we are doing is to help these rural children with their language learning struggle. We want to get them out of the fear for English, to expand the limits of their language, and to know more about the world. And we need your help.Who are we？We are Dreamkids, a start-up English school built in 2018, based in Sishui, a small town in Shandong province in China. We devote ourselves to provide quality English education for the underdeveloped area in China.We are a group of grassroots born and raised in these rural areas. As the survivors of the “Mute English”, we have a deeper realization of the English education gap between cities and our hometowns, and a better understanding of the struggle these rural kids are experiencing.Rather than staying in metropolitans like Beijing or Shanghai, we decided to go back to our hometown after finishing the study in university, and do something for our younger brothers and sisters with their English learning.What are we doing？Instead of forcing the kids to learn new words, new grammars and memorize the rules in the old way, we let them absorb the language naturally.1 Our lessonsThe Dreamkids lessons are composed of two major parts— the offline classes and the app.1) Offline classesThe Offline classes are designed to break the “Mute English ” tradition, therefore the kids are involved in an amount of oral practice during class time. We create meaningful language circumstances for the kids to have a better understanding of the content.2) AppAnother barrier that these rural families are facing, is that the parents are not able to give more help to their children, because of their poor grasp of the language. The fact is simple, the parents are also the victims of the “Mute English”.Our APP provides an interactive way for the kids to review the class, do the homework and practice oral English independently. The reward mechanism of the APP encourages them to work harder on English.For example, this is a typical learning process of one of our kids:Owen takes the DreamKids English class on a Sunday. He goes home after the class, and receives the learning pages ( words, reading materials, phonics content in the class), and the homework, through the app downloaded on his mother’s phone or pad. Then he starts to review the learning pages, and do the oral practice and reading exercises.At the same time, his teacher can check the percentage of progress on the app while he is reviewing. When he finished the homework, the performance will be updated for the teacher. And in the next Sunday class, his teacher could adjust the review part based on the update on the App.     2 Our course system3 Cultures, traditions and values of English-speaking countriesLanguage also brings people, especially the rural kids a broader look of the world.
With their curiosity being sparked by different school events like X’ mas Party, Flea Market, Easter Egg Hunt…, they want to know more about the world.                                                       
We help them understand and respect the differences between cultures and traditions.
We wish to influence their values with a more global perspective. Every unit has a “Future Leader” part, the kids are encouraged to discuss topics like environment protection, water shortage, food safety and so on.​

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">WHO WE ARE</h2>
<p><strong>The Human Communication Studio</strong>, founded by innovator and strategist Kathryn Kellner, <strong>is a global company dedicated to the idea that <u>all people have the capacity to realize their full potential</u>.</strong></p>
<p>We provide people with the fundamental skills needed to manifest profound changes in their lives, as clear and effective communication is crucial to personal growth every step of the way. Whether applied at work, at school, or amongst colleagues and friends, we have seen the difference these tools can make when cementing opportunities, advancing careers, and improving quality of life.</p>
<p>Here is what we know: When you have the knowledge needed to create a strategy, and the skills needed to execute, you can dramatically expand your capacity as a powerful communicator. In today’s world, making your voice heard is important, but being clearly understood is what makes all the difference when you strive for outcomes. </p>
<p>We are an opportunity-seizing, new-job-landing, potential-realizing, “get-you-over-the-finish-line” company. To realize that potential, we employ gesture, body language, breath, and speech to decode concepts behind communication buzz words and transform pop science ‘tips and tricks’ into actionable tools for self development.</p>
<p>How we teach and apply this information is through use of videos and in-person and remote training. Our teaching continues to evolve alongside advances in technology - but these skills have been used for decades by our private clients.</p>
<p><strong>Thousands upon thousands of people just like you have used our techniques to improve personal relationships, transform job interviews, conquer debates, engage a public audience, master speaking opportunities, gain agency in social interactions, and thrive in leadership positions.</strong></p>
<p>And now, after years in development, our rapidly expanding video resources ensure that strategies can be tailored to support unique outcomes and serve the unique needs of people both in-person and through distance learning.</p>
<p>We are committed to providing all learners with effective patterns of authentic communication.</p>
<p><strong>Help us to expand our reach and bring this platform to people around the world</strong>.</p>

</div></div>","WHO WE ARE
The Human Communication Studio, founded by innovator and strategist Kathryn Kellner, is a global company dedicated to the idea that all people have the capacity to realize their full potential.
We provide people with the fundamental skills needed to manifest profound changes in their lives, as clear and effective communication is crucial to personal growth every step of the way. Whether applied at work, at school, or amongst colleagues and friends, we have seen the difference these tools can make when cementing opportunities, advancing careers, and improving quality of life.
Here is what we know: When you have the knowledge needed to create a strategy, and the skills needed to execute, you can dramatically expand your capacity as a powerful communicator. In today’s world, making your voice heard is important, but being clearly understood is what makes all the difference when you strive for outcomes. 
We are an opportunity-seizing, new-job-landing, potential-realizing, “get-you-over-the-finish-line” company. To realize that potential, we employ gesture, body language, breath, and speech to decode concepts behind communication buzz words and transform pop science ‘tips and tricks’ into actionable tools for self development.
How we teach and apply this information is through use of videos and in-person and remote training. Our teaching continues to evolve alongside advances in technology - but these skills have been used for decades by our private clients.
Thousands upon thousands of people just like you have used our techniques to improve personal relationships, transform job interviews, conquer debates, engage a public audience, master speaking opportunities, gain agency in social interactions, and thrive in leadership positions.
And now, after years in development, our rapidly expanding video resources ensure that strategies can be tailored to support unique outcomes and serve the unique needs of people both in-person and through distance learning.
We are committed to providing all learners with effective patterns of authentic communication.
Help us to expand our reach and bring this platform to people around the world.

</div></div>","PR INQUIRIES  press@geeekclub.reproj.comWelcome to Geeek Club, the easy and FUN way to gain engineering skills. It’s no secret, engineering is one of the single most valuable skillsets you can have in this day and age.For anyone who wants to work on their inventor muscles, there’s no better way to start! If you’ve always looked up to geniuses like Tesla and Edison, then you can get a small taste of their genius and develop your technical abilities without boring yourself to tears with courses and textbooks.

 

 
 
 Are you ready to become a genius, have fun and impress everyone you meet? Geeek Club has TWO unique robotics kits for you to choose from. 
 
 
 Imagine a world where light is the only available power source, and robots scour the land in search of the precious energy to keep them going. Those robots would function in a very similar way to these nano-smart bots!With light sensors and vibro-motors, these robots will intelligently move toward any light source, giving you endless amusement and an amazing conversation starter. Their size makes them the perfect décor for your office desk and kids love playing with these bite-sized robots. 
  2L4GThis miniature robot earnestly sets out in any direction after the light it seeks. Building this robot is not only fun, but also enriching: you’ll learn everything from structural engineering to vibro-motor mechanics. 
 2L1GEvery one of these miniature light-seeking robots has their own personality which will make them a main-stay at home or in the office. By the time you are done, you’ll have a better appreciation for printed circuit boards and will have some of the essential skills of an inventor! 
 6L1GThis complex robot has 6 legs just like its namesake, and seeks the light relentlessly! You’ll learn about soldering using through-holes, surface-mounted devices and technology, and how to ensure electricity flows through every essential component. 
 MAT001This is the biggest robot in the Nano-bots set, requiring 4 printed circuit board cars to assemble. It blinks and has plenty of personality! 
 W001This nano-robot is unstoppable! With vibration, oscillation and resonance motor engineering, you’ll learn valuable skills that can help you become an electrical genius in no time! 
 TM BOTThis is the logo of our maker space TroubleMaker where the idea of nanobots was born. It represents the “devil may care” spirit of pure creative engineering, daring to push the boundaries in order to invent something new. 
 OTAKUOTAKU is a vintage Japanese robot-card. Funny illustration for start with, easy soldering for beginners, this vintage robot will take you outer space to meet the invaders. 
What if the tribal art of ancient cultures was actually based on ancient robots? Of course, it’s unlikely, but that is the inspiration for these artistic robots.The designs were inspired by North and South American indigenous cultures, as well as Scandinavian, African, and Asian amulets and artwork. This vibrant set also allows you to mix and match different pieces to invent your own creations.The Voodoo robots set is perfect for combining every aspect of STEAM learning – Science, Technology, Engineering, Art and rudimentary Math. 
 Suún IncaThis robot design is based off of the sun god and has numerous rays exuding from its circuit board body in an entrancing way. It is motor powered with many lights, helping you learn about soldering and electrical engineering while having fun.  
 Tribz BeninThis gorgeous robot makes an interesting and unique décor piece as well as an outstanding educational experience, with SMD and SMT as well as through-hole soldering fun. 
 Bony MexicoThe Bony robot has several very bright LED’s which attach to the mask/head, teaching you about electricity, light emitting diode technology, and structural engineering without you even noticing! 
 Baȁtz Indonesia BaliWhile you build this macabre Voodoo robot, you’ll also learn about the mechanics of oscillation and vibration motors which help you create a unique robot with functional mobility. 
 Drøpz JapanThis bright blue light-emitting robot is so fun to make, you’ll completely forget that you are acquiring valuable engineering skills!
 Wāld ScandinaviaWald may be the most vibrant in this set, with a vast array of bright green lights forming a spellbinding matrix. The complexity of Wald is easy enough for beginners, while giving experienced engineers enough to be interested in the entire time! 
 Helly HaitiThis robot is perfect as a Halloween decoration, with its motion and devilish appearance! The light-emitting diodes around its head give it an eerie, yet oddly satisfying finished look. 
 
 
 
 
 

Kevin Norman -  the designer of the California Games, went on to found the educational science software company Norman & Globus, makers of the ElectroWiz series of products.

Laurence Von Thomas - Design and Founder of Reflex modular film camera project. Founder and editor of online photography gallery: ""If You Leave"".
 
 With step-by-step instructions in the box, building robots becomes no more complicated than other common constructions toys.But we don’t just want you to follow steps without learning anything about what you’re doing!That’s why you’ll also receive instructional videos where the inventor of these robots shows you exactly how they work, as well as electrical information in the instruction books that familiarizes you with the components you are soldering onto these printed circuit boards. 
 There are no definitive rules when putting the robots together. Be creative, and do it in your own style! 
 

  

 

 
 

 



 
 Co-Founders Nico and Nikita are on a mission to bring movie-like robots to your DIY tabletop, but it’s not only that. They’re pushing to create a world of inventors for the next generation of technology.When Nico and Nikita met at their favorite maker space -- TroubleMaker, which was founded by Nico with partners -- they hit it off and knew they had to team up to begin writing their history on the pages of Shenzhen. Nico

Nikita is a surfer, a proud and self-proclaimed geek, and is a dedicated member of TroubleMaker. 
 With the success of this project, we will be enabled to explore further possibilities within this space. Our goal is to implement and develop further our other forward-technology ideas, ones that progress upon this one and become more complex, because we want to teach more people the basics (and beyond) of electronics.

</p><p><b>About PURT</b></p>
<p>Purt is an NGO operating in Slovakia since 2012. It seeks to
empower Roma communities and promotes interethnic cooperation. We work with a
network of Roma activists to improve the quality of life and co-habitation in
villages with a considerable amount of Roma population. With a little
contribution and a lot of enthusiasm we can help locals achieve real change in
their own lives. </p>
<p><b>How does Purt work?</b></p>
<p>-  It is a network of Roma activists who represent their
villages, and understand the small issues that affect the everyday lives of
locals. </p>
<p>-  Our activists discuss these problems on our regular
meetings, suggest solutions to them, then draw a shortlist of the most pressing
issues. </p>
<p>-  The organization provides the necessary financial
support from donations, as these projects usually do not exceed a few dozen
euros in cost.</p>
<p>-  The projects of Purt are usually implemented with the
involvement of local workforce, local companies, local governments and
citizens, which has a significantly positive impact on good relations and local
cohabitation. </p>
<p><b>What are we
campaigning for?</b></p>
<p>The organization provides financial support for a list of
projects approved for each monthly implementation period. These projects
normally have  a small budget, but significantly improve the quality of
life and co-habitation. They cover a range of issues, such as a new sound
system for children's performances, renovating bus stops or community centers,
repainting fences or benches in public areas and occasionally supporting
community-building events. These projects are usually co-funded with local
authorities, to maximize the organization's outreach. </p>
<p><b>The impact and vision
of Purt</b></p>
<p>In the past years Purt has implemented successful projects in
more than 50 settlements, and the number of successful projects has exceeded
200. The increasing number of participants proves that Purt is a good example
and that with minimal input we can achieve big improvements. With your support
we can spread this well-functioning model to other regions as well, and to
improve the quality of life and neighborly relations among the Roma and
non-Roma population. </p>

The organization provides financial support for a list of
projects approved for each monthly implementation period. These projects
normally have  a small budget, but significantly improve the quality of
life and co-habitation. They cover a range of issues, such as a new sound
system for children's performances, renovating bus stops or community centers,
repainting fences or benches in public areas and occasionally supporting
community-building events. These projects are usually co-funded with local
authorities, to maximize the organization's outreach. 
The impact and vision
of Purt
In the past years Purt has implemented successful projects in
more than 50 settlements, and the number of successful projects has exceeded
200. The increasing number of participants proves that Purt is a good example
and that with minimal input we can achieve big improvements. With your support
we can spread this well-functioning model to other regions as well, and to
improve the quality of life and neighborly relations among the Roma and
non-Roma population.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b>HOW DID WE BEGIN?</b><br/>The Old Balara Christian Community School is a non-stock, non-profit enterprise originally established in 1987 as a church outreach program in an urban poor community in Old Balara, Quezon City. The founders, Rex and Anji Resurreccion, have worked with several young people in the area since 1981. Through regular weekly Bible studies with about 15 to 20 children, many of them managed to stay in school and developed attitudes and habits that helped them to eventually finish College. Together, they established the Old Balara Christian Community (OBCC) School in 1987 to reach out to other young people in the hope of transforming the youth to be “salt and light” in the community. </p>
<p>Based on their own experience, the members of OBCC noted that the labor market had increasingly become more competitive through the years, so that the poor could not manage to match their middle class counterparts in bagging the more attractive job offers in the market place. It was also noted that among the poor, early failure in schooling was common, and the youth experienced school-or teacher-induced sense of hopelessness, lack of ambition and aspiration, and loss of motivation for further development and exercise of creativity.  Through OBCC community outreach programs, individuals and families were helped to defeat patterns of behaviors that contributed to their greater poverty, through the development of positive work habits. <span><br/></span><span><br/></span></p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">HOW ARE WE DIFFERENT?<span><br/></span></b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The OBCC School views education as not simply about preparing the young to look for good jobs, but also about preparing them to create their own jobs (through business or self-employment). This has significant meaning to children belonging to the poor of Old Balara, where very few are able to reach or finish College. Currently, half of our students (numbering 270) come from families who are able to pay tuition, and the other half come from indigent community residents whom we admit as “scholars”.  Thus, we take in one indigent scholar for every paying student we teach at the school. Due to our limited space at 701 Tandang Sora Street, Old Balara, Quezon City, we could not accommodate more students beyond 300.  Over the years, parents from within and outside the Old Balara community have visited our premises as they have heard of our unique enterprise-oriented Christian curriculum from various media.  </span></p>

<p><b>Who I am:</b></p>
<p>My
name is Elena Gogou, and I come from Athens, Greece. I am currently working in
the field of Alternative Medicine as a Healer and Flower Therapist. I have also
been practicing Biodynamic Gardening and Permaculture for the last 7 years,  I am a mother of 3 teenagers, a seed saver, an occasional artist,
and a blogger.</p>
<p>For
the first 10 years of my professional life I worked as an EFL teacher in both
formal and  informal educational settings.
I then worked as an Investigator for the Greek Ombudsman and the Children’s
Rights Ombudsman, where I organized and coordinated the operation of the Youth
Advisory Forum and e-Forum, empowering young people to learn, demand, and enjoy
their Human Rights. </p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">In
2006 I came across the world of Permaculture through the Internet, and began
reading about it, and tentatively practicing it. In 2008 and 2009 I
participated in 2 consecutive workshops on “Permaculture and Ecovillage Design”,
given by Craig Gibsone and Beatriz Guttierez from the Findhorn Community. My
life changed: I became a member of the first food cooperative in Athens, I went
on a course to gain systematic knowledge of Biodynamics, and I began organizing
my life along permaculture principles. In 2010 I gave up my job at the Greek
Ombudsman to pursue a career in Alternative Medicine, and with a group of like
minded friends started the first Athenian Urban Farm in Halandri. This was
intended as a working biodynamic farm, and as a nurturing ground exploring the
dynamics and the possibility for an intentional community (potential
ecovillage). </span><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441230735/ck34gl2nws0lkhebtbhu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Meanwhile, I became a volunteer for  <a href=""www.peliti.gr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Peliti (seed savers network)</a>and a seed-saver. In
2013 I did a PDC with Rod  Everett and
Mill Millichap at Seliana, in Greece, and started giving short courses at the
Urban Farm on permaculture, growing food, composting, etc. In 2014, having organized
various awareness-raising events (about seed and food sovereignty) I became the
coordinator of the Peliti group in Athens.  </p><p>videos of events I have organised </p><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz3fsKVrGOY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz3fsKVrGOY</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJ1ZdkCHnOg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJ1ZdkCHnOg</a><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>In 2014 I went to India representing Peliti at the Bhoomi Festival in Delhi, organised by Navdanya.

<p>I am
enthralled with the beauty of our planet, and this inspires me to make art,
flower essences, and practice permaculture. The more I practice it, the more I
want to share it with others. </p><p>I believe <i>we
can</i> live in peace, dignity and abundance, celebrating our diversity, caring
for and learning from each other (‘other’ meaning not only human but also all
the non-human inhabitants of the Earth). I believe we really  have all the resources we need to live in
happiness and abundance, and the only resource really lacking is inspiration
and imagination: this, I think, is the greatest gift permaculture has to offer
to humanity today.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441231522/n4rbxyvj6nr1rqibebvk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>So far,
I have been sharing permaculture with my friends and colleagues at the Urban
Farm, either through short courses/workshops or simply explaining why we do
things the way we do. It never fails to inspire and fire the imagination! But,
being an artist, I want to do it more artfully! This is why I have chosen to do
Rowe Morrow’s course “Permaculture Teaching Matters” in Mallorca this year <a href=""http://permamed.org/training/ptm/?lang=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">(this is where you can see what it's all about)</a>.
Rowe Morrow is an acclaimed permaculture teacher of many years, and the author
of the book “The Earth User’s Guide to Permaculture”, which was the first
permaculture book to be translated into Greek, and which I had the honour and
pleasure to edit. Through working on this book I came to appreciate and respect
the writer’s knowledge, care, and expertise in permaculture.</p>
<p>Through
the “PTM” course I am hoping to become more artful, competent and confident in
spreading the word of Permaculture in Greece. There are already 2-3 Greek
permaculture teachers, but there is a pressing need for more!</p>
<p>I
believe permaculture offers inspiration and viable ideas and solutions for a
way forward. It creates optimism and hope grounded in all the successful
ventures worldwide as well as in the tried-and-tested practices of our
ancestors, combined with modern science.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441231880/zzazixiov0e3t6vlczih.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>I
believe in empowering people to become masters and mistresses of their own fate
rather than expecting gods governments or gurus to think for them or “save”
them.</p>
<p>I
believe that the way forward is beyond the left and the right, beyond
capitalism. It lies in a new paradigm that is based upon the 3 permaculture
ethics: earth care, people care, fair share. </p>
<p>This
is the vision that I want to inspire in people, this is the vision that
inspires me.</p>
<p><b>Why Permaculture in Greece?</b></p>
<p>Every
industrialized modern country needs permaculture! But Greece has a few more
reasons that demand it:</p>
<p>a.<span> 
</span>It is a land with an abundance of valuable
material and spiritual resources that can be harvested without harming either
the people or the Earth, and which, wisely used, can contribute to the wealth
not only of the Greek people but also of the world.</p>
<p>b.<span> 
</span>The political system (both local and
European) has failed the people of Greece, whose only  hope for dignity and survival lies in a return
to its tradition: small-scale farming, self-sufficiency, resilience, arts &amp;
crafts. Yet tradition has to be informed and updated with the modern-day
findings of agro-ecology, hydrology, biotecture, and soil science in order to
be viable and relevant today. Permaculture is a system that allows for all this
and more: ideas and practices that enliven a fractured multi-cultural society
(social permaculture).</p>
<p>c.<span> 
</span>Greece is facing a humanitarian
crisis – nobody can eat money, and most people’s creativity is shattered in westernized
“9-5-type” jobs in cities!</p>
<p>d.<span> 
</span>The Greeks are an artistic
life-loving people who are now at an impasse how to go forward, how to find a
way out of the debt trap that capitalism has lured them into (like it has lured
so many other countries in its death march)</p>
<p><b><i>I
would like your help to be able to train to become an effective permaculture
teacher, so as to be able to offer permaculture training to local Greek
communities in the Greek language (without translators or interpreters). Thus

Through your kind help and funding you shall be
helping me become a competent and confident permaculture teacher in Greece: inspiring
the Greek people into becoming resilient and self-sufficient, sowing the seeds
of hope and dignity.

Who I am:
My
name is Elena Gogou, and I come from Athens, Greece. I am currently working in
the field of Alternative Medicine as a Healer and Flower Therapist. I have also
been practicing Biodynamic Gardening and Permaculture for the last 7 years,  I am a mother of 3 teenagers, a seed saver, an occasional artist,
and a blogger.
For
the first 10 years of my professional life I worked as an EFL teacher in both
formal and  informal educational settings.
I then worked as an Investigator for the Greek Ombudsman and the Children’s
Rights Ombudsman, where I organized and coordinated the operation of the Youth
Advisory Forum and e-Forum, empowering young people to learn, demand, and enjoy
their Human Rights. In
2006 I came across the world of Permaculture through the Internet, and began
reading about it, and tentatively practicing it. In 2008 and 2009 I
participated in 2 consecutive workshops on “Permaculture and Ecovillage Design”,
given by Craig Gibsone and Beatriz Guttierez from the Findhorn Community. My
life changed: I became a member of the first food cooperative in Athens, I went
on a course to gain systematic knowledge of Biodynamics, and I began organizing
my life along permaculture principles. In 2010 I gave up my job at the Greek
Ombudsman to pursue a career in Alternative Medicine, and with a group of like
minded friends started the first Athenian Urban Farm in Halandri. This was
intended as a working biodynamic farm, and as a nurturing ground exploring the
dynamics and the possibility for an intentional community (potential
ecovillage). Meanwhile, I became a volunteer for  Peliti (seed savers network)and a seed-saver. In
2013 I did a PDC with Rod  Everett and
Mill Millichap at Seliana, in Greece, and started giving short courses at the
Urban Farm on permaculture, growing food, composting, etc. In 2014, having organized
various awareness-raising events (about seed and food sovereignty) I became the
coordinator of the Peliti group in Athens.  videos of events I have organised https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jz3fsKVrGOYhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJ1ZdkCHnOgIn 2014 I went to India representing Peliti at the Bhoomi Festival in Delhi, organised by Navdanya. I also visited the Earth University ""Bija Vidyapeeth"" in Dehradun, and gave a presentation about the work of Peliti seed saving network in and around Greece to the students of the ""A-Z Agroecology"" course.My quest and vision:
I am
enthralled with the beauty of our planet, and this inspires me to make art,
flower essences, and practice permaculture. The more I practice it, the more I
want to share it with others. I believe we
can live in peace, dignity and abundance, celebrating our diversity, caring
for and learning from each other (‘other’ meaning not only human but also all
the non-human inhabitants of the Earth). I believe we really  have all the resources we need to live in
happiness and abundance, and the only resource really lacking is inspiration
and imagination: this, I think, is the greatest gift permaculture has to offer
to humanity today.
So far,
I have been sharing permaculture with my friends and colleagues at the Urban
Farm, either through short courses/workshops or simply explaining why we do
things the way we do. It never fails to inspire and fire the imagination! But,
being an artist, I want to do it more artfully! This is why I have chosen to do
Rowe Morrow’s course “Permaculture Teaching Matters” in Mallorca this year (this is where you can see what it's all about).
Rowe Morrow is an acclaimed permaculture teacher of many years, and the author
of the book “The Earth User’s Guide to Permaculture”, which was the first
permaculture book to be translated into Greek, and which I had the honour and
pleasure to edit. Through working on this book I came to appreciate and respect
the writer’s knowledge, care, and expertise in permaculture.
Through
the “PTM” course I am hoping to become more artful, competent and confident in
spreading the word of Permaculture in Greece. There are already 2-3 Greek
permaculture teachers, but there is a pressing need for more!
I
believe permaculture offers inspiration and viable ideas and solutions for a
way forward. It creates optimism and hope grounded in all the successful
ventures worldwide as well as in the tried-and-tested practices of our
ancestors, combined with modern science.
I
believe in empowering people to become masters and mistresses of their own fate
rather than expecting gods governments or gurus to think for them or “save”
them.
I
believe that the way forward is beyond the left and the right, beyond
capitalism. It lies in a new paradigm that is based upon the 3 permaculture
ethics: earth care, people care, fair share. 
This
is the vision that I want to inspire in people, this is the vision that
inspires me.
Why Permaculture in Greece?
Every
industrialized modern country needs permaculture! But Greece has a few more
reasons that demand it:
a. 
It is a land with an abundance of valuable
material and spiritual resources that can be harvested without harming either
the people or the Earth, and which, wisely used, can contribute to the wealth
not only of the Greek people but also of the world.
b. 
The political system (both local and
European) has failed the people of Greece, whose only  hope for dignity and survival lies in a return
to its tradition: small-scale farming, self-sufficiency, resilience, arts &
crafts. Yet tradition has to be informed and updated with the modern-day
findings of agro-ecology, hydrology, biotecture, and soil science in order to
be viable and relevant today. Permaculture is a system that allows for all this
and more: ideas and practices that enliven a fractured multi-cultural society
(social permaculture).
c. 
Greece is facing a humanitarian
crisis – nobody can eat money, and most people’s creativity is shattered in westernized
“9-5-type” jobs in cities!
d. 
The Greeks are an artistic
life-loving people who are now at an impasse how to go forward, how to find a
way out of the debt trap that capitalism has lured them into (like it has lured
so many other countries in its death march)
I
would like your help to be able to train to become an effective permaculture
teacher, so as to be able to offer permaculture training to local Greek
communities in the Greek language (without translators or interpreters). Thus
we shall be able to build a culture of resilience and sustainability in a land
which has still much to offer, still much to teach the world, but which is
suffering for lack of empowerment and inspiration as well as lack of wise
planning and ethical management.

Greece when we accept a gift we always give a gift back to the giver, and we

</div>","Hello, we are Nitrox Development; a group of four students and software developers that have been close friends for several years.  When we decided it was time to push our boundaries as tech-savvy people we came to the conclusion that we should develop our own mobile application.  Because we are all studying in college as aspiring professionals in different software related fields, we figured it would be best to construct an application on something relatable to our lives and the lives of many young adults; college.  That is when the idea of UConnect was conjured.This campaign is extremely important to us because while we are still growing as students and learning everyday, we surely don't lack passion.  We are up for the challenge but we need your help to make UConnect a reality and help bring it to every college across America.  We appreciate your support!


We are trying to raise  money for development resources and programs.  With an app of the magnitude we hope to achieve, there will be many costs along the way including buying graphic design software, building or paying for servers, etc.  Our fund are low, so any and all contributions toward completing this project will help speed up the overall process and get a beta version out to schools very soon! Want to see UConnect come to your campus first? Check out how to make this happen:

$1 - ""Thank You!""
$5 - ""Tier 1""
$15 - ""Tier 2""
$25 - ""Tier 3""
$50 - ""Tier 4""
$500 - ""School Investor""

Whether or not we reach our goal we will take whatever funding we raised and work with what we have.  We are passionate about this project and will do whatever it takes with what we have to make this work.

Even if monetary contributions aren't your style, don't worry!  Just help spread the word by telling friends, tweeting at us - @NitroxDev - or liking/sharing us on Facebook - Facebook.com/NitroxDev.  We appreciate any help you can give us.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Esta campanha é sobre colocar a educação sobre rodas e levá-la para áreas do Rio de Janeiro, onde não existe uma estrutura de biblioteca permanente ou linguagem suficiente, arte e aulas de redação nas escolas.<br/>
<br/>O ônibus será um micro-ônibus convertido que é parte biblioteca parte, estúdio de arte e escrita. Ele funcionará como parte pendente do nosso braço sem fins lucrativos da PJAE, que trabalha para encontrar e apoiar jovens artistas e escritores excepcionais no Brasil.<br/>
<br/>O ônibus literário irá nos permitir dar a milhares de crianças o acesso à nossa equipe de professores, voluntários, centenas de livros (em quatro línguas diferentes) e aulas intrigantes. Seremos capazes de apoiar as escolas e as comunidades com instalações de biblioteca, sessões de contação de histórias, os clubes do livro, poesia, leituras encenadas, oficinas de arte e aulas de línguas. Vamos trabalhar junto às escolas para determinar quais livros e atividades são apropriadas. Como nosso ônibus também funcionará como uma sala de aula, poderemos convidar instrutores para conduzir aulas criativas da arte, astronomia  até vários outros assuntos.</p><p>Vamos colocar um Ônibus Literário aqui</p>
<span><p><b>QUEM SOMOS</b><br/>
<br/>Somos Lesa, Talita, Katia, Evandro, Millicent and Stacey, alguns dos nomes por trás deste projeto.

Somos educadores, artistas, pais, cuidadores, voluntários e empresários. Coletivamente, temos mais de quinze anos de experiência de ensino e incontáveis experiências de voluntariado em todo o mundo.<br/>
<br/>Ao fazer uma pesquisa sobre as artes nas escolas brasileiras e desenvolvendo a PJAE, descobrimos que muitos estudantes não estavam recebendo a oportunidade de explorar, as artes em sala de aula, especialmente nas áreas rurais e pobres. Como iriamos encontrar os melhores jovens artistas e escritores, se alguns eram excluídos com base na economia e acesso? Assim, foi necessário encontrar uma solução de inclusão e é isso que este ônibus pretende ser, a primeira de muitas salas de aula e bibliotecas móveis em todo o Brasil, que oferece um espaço que incentiva a leitura, a aprendizagem e partilha nas artes visuais e de linguagem.<br/>
<br/>
<b>O QUE NÓS PRECISAMOS?</b> </p>

Quanto mais você contribuir, melhor o ônibus ficará esteticamente e funcionalmente, por exemplo, se nós levantamos $ 15,750 seremos capazes de instalar itens importantes - como um aparelho de ar condicionado, iluminação, um toldo acoplado(para aulas ao ar livre) feito sob encomenda, cadeiras dobráveis, mesas, um kit de gás natural (GNV) (para que possamos economizar em custos de transporte), painéis solares (para energia), um computador, software da biblioteca, alto-falantes e um projetor.

How were we going to find the best young artists and writers, if some were being excluded based on economics and access?  So we needed to find an inclusion solution and that is what this bus aims to be, the first of many mobile classrooms and libraries across Brazil, that provides a space that encourages reading, learning and sharing in the visual and language arts.WHAT’S IT GONNA TAKE?
We already have a good collection of books, and we have a bunch of art equipment to start.  So that just leaves the bus.  We're asking you for at least $4,700 USD to purchase an old mini-bus, ensure that it is roadworthy (repaired, licensed and insured) and to transform it into a fun mobile library in its simplest form. The more you contribute, the better the bus will be aesthetically and functionally, for example if we raise $15,750 we will be able to install important items – like an air conditioner, lighting, a built-in awning (for outdoor classes), custom folding chairs and tables, a natural gas (NGV) kit (so we can save on transportation costs), solar panels (for power), a computer, library software, speakers and a projector.  To accomplish any or some of these extras remember we need to raise more than our $4,700 goal. WHAT’S IN IT FOR YOU?  
If you check out the right sidebar there are some awesome perks waiting for you.  T-shirts, postcards, your name on the bus, even your portrait on the bus!! Plus we are inviting you to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to volunteer with us for a day.

RISKS AND CHALLENGES
This is a wonderful project with achievable goals. We already have a few vehicles in mind to choose from, we’ve contacted a well-known company that specializes in conversions and they have kindly run us through their process and a projected timeline.  We are giving ourselves 6 months from the end of the campaign to launch. Of course, if we are able to launch before that we definitely will.  To ensure the longevity of the Book Bus Project we will procure cooperate sponsorship and host paying workshops to offset our expenses.

So, lets do this!Thank you!-PJAE Team! ****************************Versão  Português******************************""É aqui onde Alice no país das maravilhas encontra o Mágico de Oz. ... Quando as crianças veem aquele ônibus, é mágico."" Instrutor - art Lynette Henry da Orange Show Art Bus”
Esta campanha é sobre colocar a educação sobre rodas e levá-la para áreas do Rio de Janeiro, onde não existe uma estrutura de biblioteca permanente ou linguagem suficiente, arte e aulas de redação nas escolas.
O ônibus será um micro-ônibus convertido que é parte biblioteca parte, estúdio de arte e escrita. Ele funcionará como parte pendente do nosso braço sem fins lucrativos da PJAE, que trabalha para encontrar e apoiar jovens artistas e escritores excepcionais no Brasil.
O ônibus literário irá nos permitir dar a milhares de crianças o acesso à nossa equipe de professores, voluntários, centenas de livros (em quatro línguas diferentes) e aulas intrigantes. Seremos capazes de apoiar as escolas e as comunidades com instalações de biblioteca, sessões de contação de histórias, os clubes do livro, poesia, leituras encenadas, oficinas de arte e aulas de línguas. Vamos trabalhar junto às escolas para determinar quais livros e atividades são apropriadas. Como nosso ônibus também funcionará como uma sala de aula, poderemos convidar instrutores para conduzir aulas criativas da arte, astronomia  até vários outros assuntos.Vamos colocar um Ônibus Literário aqui
QUEM SOMOS
Somos Lesa, Talita, Katia, Evandro, Millicent and Stacey, alguns dos nomes por trás deste projeto. Alguns de nós vivem no Brasil, no Canadá e nos EUA, mas o que nos une é a nossa crença em como a educação pode transformar e este projeto. Somos educadores, artistas, pais, cuidadores, voluntários e empresários. Coletivamente, temos mais de quinze anos de experiência de ensino e incontáveis experiências de voluntariado em todo o mundo.
Ao fazer uma pesquisa sobre as artes nas escolas brasileiras e desenvolvendo a PJAE, descobrimos que muitos estudantes não estavam recebendo a oportunidade de explorar, as artes em sala de aula, especialmente nas áreas rurais e pobres. Como iriamos encontrar os melhores jovens artistas e escritores, se alguns eram excluídos com base na economia e acesso? Assim, foi necessário encontrar uma solução de inclusão e é isso que este ônibus pretende ser, a primeira de muitas salas de aula e bibliotecas móveis em todo o Brasil, que oferece um espaço que incentiva a leitura, a aprendizagem e partilha nas artes visuais e de linguagem.

O QUE NÓS PRECISAMOS? 
Nós já temos uma boa coleção de livros e equipamentos artisticos para. De modo que só resta o micro-ônibus. Estamos pedindo, pelo menos, $ 4.700 para comprar um velho micro-ônibus, no certificar que ele está em condições de circular (reparado, licenciado e segurado) e transformá-lo em uma divertida biblioteca móvel em sua forma mais simples. Quanto mais você contribuir, melhor o ônibus ficará esteticamente e funcionalmente, por exemplo, se nós levantamos $ 15,750 seremos capazes de instalar itens importantes - como um aparelho de ar condicionado, iluminação, um toldo acoplado(para aulas ao ar livre) feito sob encomenda, cadeiras dobráveis, mesas, um kit de gás natural (GNV) (para que possamos economizar em custos de transporte), painéis solares (para energia), um computador, software da biblioteca, alto-falantes e um projetor. Para conseguir qualquer ou alguns desses extras lembre-se que precisamos para levantar mais do que o nosso objetivo $ 4.700.

have a life span of a minimum of 20years. <br/><br/>
<p>The clinics are in Malindi 
(north of Mombasa) and one is out by Lake Victoria in the west of Kenya. <br/></p>
<p>The tank to be installed in the Rift valley will provide a community 
with a water source for small scale irrigation of a plot of land next to
 the church where the water will be harvested from. <br/></p>
<p>The church is the 
biggest building in the area and the roof area provides us with 
sufficient capacity to fill the tank. We have irrigation piping and 
pumps so that water can be delivered to an area approx. an acre to grow 
vegetables for the community.<br/></p>

<h3>How You Can Help<br/>
</h3> <p>We have successfully funded the purchase of the tanks and have shipped them to Kenya. <br/></p>
<p>We still however need a small amount more to cover the transport costs within Kenya of the tanks and associated installation equipment.</p>
<ul>
<li>If we do not reach our funding goal all collected funds will still go towards the installation costs.</li>
<li>If we exceed our funding goal all collected funds will be used towards the cost of purchasing further tanks.</li>

with a water source for small scale irrigation of a plot of land next to
 the church where the water will be harvested from. 
The church is the 
biggest building in the area and the roof area provides us with 
sufficient capacity to fill the tank. We have irrigation piping and 
pumps so that water can be delivered to an area approx. an acre to grow 
vegetables for the community.
  
How You Can Help
 We have successfully funded the purchase of the tanks and have shipped them to Kenya. 
We still however need a small amount more to cover the transport costs within Kenya of the tanks and associated installation equipment.

If we do not reach our funding goal all collected funds will still go towards the installation costs.
If we exceed our funding goal all collected funds will be used towards the cost of purchasing further tanks.

  


Some people can't contribute financially and we fully understand that but you can still help by:

Following The Three Musketeers on Facebook 
Sharing this project on your social media accounts.



We will regularly update our social media accounts to keep people updated on the installation progress!
Thank you in advance to everyone who supports this project. You have no
 idea of the difference this will make to a single person, their 
family and community.

Who are 'The Three Musketeers Children's Fund'

The Three Musketeers Children's Fund has been set up by Brian and Maria O’Shea to honour the memory of their beloved children, Søren, Saoirse and Connor who died tragically on the 16th of July 2013 in a car crash in Denmark.
The fund’s aim is to support projects run by already established 
organizations with a view to improving health, education, safety and 
education for children in countries where no other alternatives are 
available to them. All organizations we work with and support have to be
 charitable by law.

Why a school:

Our partners have told us that education is critical to changing the cycle of poverty in the Ti Plas Kazo community.  
Building a neighborhood school has been a part of our shared vision for over a decade.

Haiti’s public school system accommodates very few children (only 10% of the schools in Haiti are public) and most families in Ti Plas Kazo cannot afford the tuition required to send their children to “private” school.

The school’s multiple uses:The school building includes six large classrooms, as well as a kitchen/cafeteria, and community space. The vision for this space is:

To provide quality education emphasizing strong academics, entrepreneurial skills, and leadership development.


To house the current food program. A daily hot meal will be served to students and other hungry children in the neighborhood. For most, it will be their only meal of the day.


To house the current after‐school and summer camp programs, providing a space to teach practical vocational skills that will allow students and other neighborhood children to earn income after graduation–a pressing need expressed by the community.


To serve as a positive, safe hub for people of all ages in the community to come together, to learn, and to solve problems.

Status of construction:

The construction is almost 75% completed and is on schedule and on budget!


The architect, Chuck Newman, of Schools for Children of the World, has designed many schools in developing countries--including 14 in Haiti--and is working with the Port‐ au‐Prince based construction company to reach their goal of completing the school’s construction by the end of the year.


The majority of the construction crew has been hired from the local Ti Plas Kazo neighborhood.  This is a huge benefit for the community, as the majority of Haitians (almost 70%) are not formally employed.

<div>Miskitu villages are under siege. Drug traffickers, invaders, and <i>Colonos,</i> under government  protection and orders, have managed to run the Miskitu villagers out of their homes in the mountains to the polluted Wasban River where they are dying from drinking parasite infested waters.  People are dying from severe dysentery, vomiting and starvation. Once a thriving fishing community, the people have no source of protein from the once abundant river. The fish no longer thrive in these contaminated waters caused by drilling, mining, and deforestation. The lethal impact of greed and corruption have left the Miskitu people without even a means to plant the simplest of grains.  The ecosystem has been robbed of it's vivacity yielding it a wasteland and mass graveyard. Foreign companies are  reaping from the land and waters. </div>
<div>The Miskitu People are characterized by their communal nature, varied languages, and love for nature and education. The nation once spanned the entire coast of Central America but has since been diminished to just a strip of land along the Nicaraguan and Honduran coasts. The Miskitu citizens are becoming sick from the dirty water infested with parasites and lack of food, not to mention the immense violence they face. What is left is a group of very vulnerable people who<b> just want to be respected and want to live among everyone in peace.  </b>However, these attributes are being compromised by militant external operatives. </div>

<p>Children and the elderly are most vulnerable to hunger, the parasite infested water (causing dysentary) that once was abundant with fish, they are forbidden to utilize their own land (home to hundreds of fruit trees, vegetables, and other beneficial plants and fauna) by the national government. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Before the next trip back to the Miskitu Coast, it is imperative that the people of the world join and help us. We have a team working tirelessly who managed to document their struggle and deliver 25,000 pounds of food and supplies (which has since been commandeered by the government). The Miskitu people are open to change and want to share their wealthy land but <b>ethically</b>. The Miskitu Nation is an autonomous nation but not treated as such - their land has been ransacked by foreign companies and local governments. Violence has put the Miskitu in a very vulnerable situation. </span></p>
<p>Rather than saying and wearing relics from the past of nations that were exterminated and remembered, we can <b>live among them</b> and learn from them. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The Miskitu people do not have a problem trading, exchanging/selling
their riches, for education and finance. The only demand they have

</div><div> <p>The risk is that the national government has unleashed the troops on the humanitarian effort.

</div><br/><p></p></div>","Short Summary
Miskitu villages are under siege. Drug traffickers, invaders, and Colonos, under government  protection and orders, have managed to run the Miskitu villagers out of their homes in the mountains to the polluted Wasban River where they are dying from drinking parasite infested waters.  People are dying from severe dysentery, vomiting and starvation. Once a thriving fishing community, the people have no source of protein from the once abundant river. The fish no longer thrive in these contaminated waters caused by drilling, mining, and deforestation. The lethal impact of greed and corruption have left the Miskitu people without even a means to plant the simplest of grains.  The ecosystem has been robbed of it's vivacity yielding it a wasteland and mass graveyard. Foreign companies are  reaping from the land and waters. 
The Miskitu People are characterized by their communal nature, varied languages, and love for nature and education. The nation once spanned the entire coast of Central America but has since been diminished to just a strip of land along the Nicaraguan and Honduran coasts. The Miskitu citizens are becoming sick from the dirty water infested with parasites and lack of food, not to mention the immense violence they face. What is left is a group of very vulnerable people who just want to be respected and want to live among everyone in peace.  However, these attributes are being compromised by militant external operatives. 
What We Need & What You Get

What You Get?:

You get to see your money at work, we will keep you up to date with the progress!
Helping rebuild a once vibrant community and make the world aware of the Miskitu people and the land. We want to help them to help themselves once again
Local goods unique to Miskitu people such as recipes, jewlery, toys, music, etc. A people rich in culture have so much they want to share with the world!
Professional photos, book from Miskitu political refugee, Josephine Robertson, download and/or tickets to premier of documentary, and invitations to future dinners and fundraisers. 


We need at least 15,000 dollars, to buy:

Clean water, emergency water kits, water tanks to collect rain

Sanitary/ Health products such as tampons, toilet paper, etc
Dried and non perishable foods and vitamins
Books, pencils, shoes for the children

    The Impact Our campaign is to assist an ancient civilization about which very few people know about. Yet even in their present, starved and sickly, they find joy and continue to persevere. The need is URGENT. 
Children and the elderly are most vulnerable to hunger, the parasite infested water (causing dysentary) that once was abundant with fish, they are forbidden to utilize their own land (home to hundreds of fruit trees, vegetables, and other beneficial plants and fauna) by the national government. 
Before the next trip back to the Miskitu Coast, it is imperative that the people of the world join and help us. We have a team working tirelessly who managed to document their struggle and deliver 25,000 pounds of food and supplies (which has since been commandeered by the government). The Miskitu people are open to change and want to share their wealthy land but ethically. The Miskitu Nation is an autonomous nation but not treated as such - their land has been ransacked by foreign companies and local governments. Violence has put the Miskitu in a very vulnerable situation. 
Rather than saying and wearing relics from the past of nations that were exterminated and remembered, we can live among them and learn from them. 
The Miskitu people do not have a problem trading, exchanging/selling
their riches, for education and finance. The only demand they have
and will die for is that others show respect for the earth and their life. 
Risks & Challenges
 The risk is that the national government has unleashed the troops on the humanitarian effort. A 20 foot container of food and supplies has since been detained by the Department of Health and Agriculture in Managua, Nicaragua (the Pacific side, Miskito land is on the Atlantic side).   It's been there since August 11th 2015 and only a small fraction of the 25,000 lbs of goods has made to the people. 
To combat this, goods will be bought in Nicaragua and sorrounding countries and taken DIRECTLY to the people.
As of early September, in the towns of Santa Clara and Esperanza, the  Miskitu Territory is being routinely sneak attacked by vigilantes, Colonos. In addition to imposing the strict laws of not allowing them to utilize their own land. During the most recent trip down there,the Colonos came into town and took anything they deemed dangerous (forks, knives, machetes used for cutting coconuts) in danger of the Miskitu rising up.  
Other Ways You Can HelpThe needs are obvious. The Miskitu are facing starvation, disease, and personal affronts and terror. Funds are needed to bring these people the most basic necessities of life. It is through the generous support of donors like you to maintain and improve services. This caring support is essential and timely. Charitable contributions are the only way to assure the Miskitu people are not left to struggle alone. Won't you please give generously?You can also educate yourself on The Miskitu people, spread the word, come to our events (in the SF Bay Area). Research and speak up about indigenous rights! We are all one people after all. Have a blessed day and much love!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>Aiken high school is a high needs urban high school in Cincinnati, OH. Last year, we launched a fundraising campaign for disposable lab safety gear, chemicals, and durable lab equipment for urban high school students. We were able to raise roughly 20% of our goal, and, oh, what we did with that money, my friends. We launched a student-led initiative to remediate a piece of urban wasteland owned by the school - a parcel that had been abandoned for the better part of a decade. In that time, it had become inaccessible due to the construction of new buildings around it and illegal dumping.  After climbing down into the area by chance, the science club, together with the AP environmental science class, designed and constructed a 250 ft environmentally sensitive footpath to make the site accessible, began construction on 400 square feet of gravity-watered gardens, cleared out two tons of trash, reopened a creek, removed invasive species, conducted an extensive water and soil testing program over 60 acres,  remediated a wetland, and planted a prairie. </div>
<div>This year, we are asking for your help again so that we can continue our work. For those that generously donated last year, and for those who might be able to do so for the first time, here is what we did with last year's donations.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Science for a better world</h3>
<div>This is the science club (minus four members). We are standing in front of a steep, overgrown hill.  In Fall 2014, we climbed down it. </div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444501827/rh3u1loheptexskc8ssv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<div>This is what that slope was like in September 2014  - steep, dangerous due to fallen and dead trees, poison ivy, and overwhelmed with invasive species. </div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444502346/rq21ojqjk4pkgxvvmx4y.png"" src="""" style=""width: 269.165px; height: 360px;""/></p>
<p>Um, so what? But what was down there at the bottom were 60+ acres of school property formerly the site of a long out-of-use athletic facility that had been more recently used as a construction debris dump and combined sewage overflow basin for the nearby heavily polluted Mill Creek.  The original district plan, dependent on a rebuild of the sewer system, was to sell the property to the electric company to build a power plant. </p>
<p>This had not happened in part because the federally mandated sewer plan was put on hold. In addition, the parcel became completely inaccessible by road when the old school buildings were demolished and new ones built. During the demolition and construction phase, everyone, from the construction firms to private individuals, dumped into the area.  </p>
<p>Hard to picture? Here is a photo of us at the base of the slope removing invasive plants in the early spring - you get a lot of die-back in our vegetation zone. What you see in the background isn't really as natural it seems - most of that ""meadow"" is composed heavy construction debris (mostly concrete and rebar) covered with thin layer of soil and grass planted by the sewer company. </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444503683/hquzdzipctdblmouhy6y.png"" src="""" style=""width: 594.039px; height: 389px;""/></p>
<p><br/></p>We decided to build an environmentally sensitive path down the slope to open up the area for remediation. The students precisely calculated the quantity of untreated sand, gravel, and landscape timbers we would need. They did all of the construction.<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444504652/liuva1fl8ytdbcxlzjcx.png"" src="""" style=""width: 299.853px; height: 311px;""/></p>
<p>We spent the rest of the fall and winter, including weekends and school breaks, clearing the location of the path of trash and debris. We completed the path in May, in the rain, in one day, with the help of a local church that loaned us a four-wheeler with a grader attachment. Can you feel the mud?</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444504774/lpzvz3fuuvnzvv7xucan.png"" src="""" style=""width: 588.608px; height: 375px;""/></p>

<br/><p>In addition to this engineering and construction project, we spent several days per week throughout the school year designing and implementing an extensive testing program to determine the toxicity of the water and soil throughout the site. We were particularly interested in very overgrown area which we identified as the bed of the original creek through the parcel, now used for sewage overflow during periods of heavy rain. This is what we were up against there. This is an interesting photo because, if you look behind the student in the orange shirt, you can see the concrete that makes up  the ""hill"" behind her poking through the grass. </p>

<p><br/></p>Water and soil testing over 60 acres is not for the fainthearted. The bacterial contamination was so extreme in some areas that we had to call out the sewer department for emergency remediation. There was also extensive contamination with heavy metals, primarily, we think, from local companies dumping toxic materials like paint, car parts, tires, and motor oil. <p><br/></p>
<p>Environmental science - most of it really happens indoors in the lab.<br/></p>

<div><br/></div>
<div>Once we determined the relative safety of the water running into the old creek bed, we decided to build gravity-watered garden beds. A wetland opened up by our trash removal ran along one side of the garden site, which will provide a wealth of opportunities for investigating the effect of raised gardens on local aquatic ecosystems. Below you can see the garden beds under construction.</div>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Simultaneously, we ran a hydroponics study in the classroom (yes, simultaneously with all-the-above - we were busy) to determine which plants were most likely to tolerate the high nitrogen/high phosphorus content of the soil, which was hydrated by run off from the school area and the (artificially-controlled) overflow of the creek bed. Two students worked on the hydroponics project every day for four months.</p>

</div>
</div><div> <p>By the end of the year, we had reached  half of our goals. The path was built and the remediation area was now accessible again. We had come up with protocols for testing soil and water over a large area, and our hydroponics technique was perfected. We had built the garden beds, but the 100-year rain of the early summer washed away the framing before we could finish them. We think we know how to engineer for that possibility now.  We were able to re-seed the area cleared of invasive species with local (prairie) plants, but were not able to do this for more than a third of the site due to timing and funding. </p>
<p>Large parts of the site still need our help. Invasive species are still a problem, as is illegal dumping.  We hope to expand our access path to connect with a parks department wildlife conservation area path which we have heard is up the northeast slope of the basin, but which we have not yet located.

</div></div>","Summary
Aiken high school is a high needs urban high school in Cincinnati, OH. Last year, we launched a fundraising campaign for disposable lab safety gear, chemicals, and durable lab equipment for urban high school students. We were able to raise roughly 20% of our goal, and, oh, what we did with that money, my friends. We launched a student-led initiative to remediate a piece of urban wasteland owned by the school - a parcel that had been abandoned for the better part of a decade. In that time, it had become inaccessible due to the construction of new buildings around it and illegal dumping.  After climbing down into the area by chance, the science club, together with the AP environmental science class, designed and constructed a 250 ft environmentally sensitive footpath to make the site accessible, began construction on 400 square feet of gravity-watered gardens, cleared out two tons of trash, reopened a creek, removed invasive species, conducted an extensive water and soil testing program over 60 acres,  remediated a wetland, and planted a prairie. 
This year, we are asking for your help again so that we can continue our work. For those that generously donated last year, and for those who might be able to do so for the first time, here is what we did with last year's donations.

Science for a better world
This is the science club (minus four members). We are standing in front of a steep, overgrown hill.  In Fall 2014, we climbed down it. 




This is what that slope was like in September 2014  - steep, dangerous due to fallen and dead trees, poison ivy, and overwhelmed with invasive species. 


Um, so what? But what was down there at the bottom were 60+ acres of school property formerly the site of a long out-of-use athletic facility that had been more recently used as a construction debris dump and combined sewage overflow basin for the nearby heavily polluted Mill Creek.  The original district plan, dependent on a rebuild of the sewer system, was to sell the property to the electric company to build a power plant. 
This had not happened in part because the federally mandated sewer plan was put on hold. In addition, the parcel became completely inaccessible by road when the old school buildings were demolished and new ones built. During the demolition and construction phase, everyone, from the construction firms to private individuals, dumped into the area.  
Hard to picture? Here is a photo of us at the base of the slope removing invasive plants in the early spring - you get a lot of die-back in our vegetation zone. What you see in the background isn't really as natural it seems - most of that ""meadow"" is composed heavy construction debris (mostly concrete and rebar) covered with thin layer of soil and grass planted by the sewer company. 


We decided to build an environmentally sensitive path down the slope to open up the area for remediation. The students precisely calculated the quantity of untreated sand, gravel, and landscape timbers we would need. They did all of the construction.

We spent the rest of the fall and winter, including weekends and school breaks, clearing the location of the path of trash and debris. We completed the path in May, in the rain, in one day, with the help of a local church that loaned us a four-wheeler with a grader attachment. Can you feel the mud?


This was the result
Middle section


In addition to this engineering and construction project, we spent several days per week throughout the school year designing and implementing an extensive testing program to determine the toxicity of the water and soil throughout the site. We were particularly interested in very overgrown area which we identified as the bed of the original creek through the parcel, now used for sewage overflow during periods of heavy rain. This is what we were up against there. This is an interesting photo because, if you look behind the student in the orange shirt, you can see the concrete that makes up  the ""hill"" behind her poking through the grass. 


Water and soil testing over 60 acres is not for the fainthearted. The bacterial contamination was so extreme in some areas that we had to call out the sewer department for emergency remediation. There was also extensive contamination with heavy metals, primarily, we think, from local companies dumping toxic materials like paint, car parts, tires, and motor oil. 
Environmental science - most of it really happens indoors in the lab.





Once we determined the relative safety of the water running into the old creek bed, we decided to build gravity-watered garden beds. A wetland opened up by our trash removal ran along one side of the garden site, which will provide a wealth of opportunities for investigating the effect of raised gardens on local aquatic ecosystems. Below you can see the garden beds under construction.



Simultaneously, we ran a hydroponics study in the classroom (yes, simultaneously with all-the-above - we were busy) to determine which plants were most likely to tolerate the high nitrogen/high phosphorus content of the soil, which was hydrated by run off from the school area and the (artificially-controlled) overflow of the creek bed. Two students worked on the hydroponics project every day for four months.







What We Need 

 By the end of the year, we had reached  half of our goals. The path was built and the remediation area was now accessible again. We had come up with protocols for testing soil and water over a large area, and our hydroponics technique was perfected. We had built the garden beds, but the 100-year rain of the early summer washed away the framing before we could finish them. We think we know how to engineer for that possibility now.  We were able to re-seed the area cleared of invasive species with local (prairie) plants, but were not able to do this for more than a third of the site due to timing and funding. 
Large parts of the site still need our help. Invasive species are still a problem, as is illegal dumping.  We hope to expand our access path to connect with a parks department wildlife conservation area path which we have heard is up the northeast slope of the basin, but which we have not yet located. Given the history of contamination, our water and soil testing protocol needs to be ongoing if we are going to continue to safely work on the site at all. The students have learned authentic environmental science and laboratory techniques, but this, and so much more, remains out of our reach due to our limited resources.  The resources we need will be used not just by our environmental science program, but by  all of our science classes as we continue to integrate our field work into real world, project-based science for all our students. Our greatest need remains safety gear and other single use or non-durable equipment that needs to be bought every year: gloves, aprons, disinfecting materials, pipettes, bins, duct tape, chemicals, reaction plates, and test kits. 
We also very badly need  rubber boots (""Wellies"") for about twenty students in a range of sizes since our students do not have more than one or two pairs of shoes, and the outdoor work is hard on footwear. Our estimate for non-durable equipment plus (re-usable) work clothing and footwear is $2,500
We also badly need permanent lab equipment, particularly microscopes. The entire high school is still getting by with three, two of which are constantly on the repair bench, and only one of which is capable of the resolution needed to count microorganisms in a water sample. It also increasingly clear, given the level of bacterial contamination at our testing sites, that we cannot continue our soil and water testing without an autoclave. Another good stereoscopic microscope plus a desktop autoclave would cost over $2000.
Our school continues to have no budget for materials needed on the scale of our professional-level environmental science work.   We have just $250 in our lab safety budget from the district. 
    
The Impact We believe our work is important. Our goal is to involve the entire Cincinnati Public School district in large scale urban wasteland remediation, with Aiken teachers and Aiken students providing generational support. Cincinnati is a rust belt town with large tracts of abandoned land. We are making our difference at Aiken and want to share our knowledge with the rest of the city.  When Aiken students and other visitors walk down the path into an area once known primarily as a good place to dump old car parts, the potential of urban wasteland throughout the city becomes real.

<p>My name is James Faucette and I’m asking for your support of my dream to help the advancement of Maryland youth, starting in P.G. County. To give a little a background; I was born in Calvert County, Maryland and taken by CPS at 3 because my mother tried to burn down the house while my brother and I were in it, moved from foster home to be eventually adopted at 9. Approximately 3 years later, my parents separated and I was forced to move with my mom.  Going through a struggle financially, emotionally and feeling invisible, I made dumb decisions and became an ""at-risk"" youth.  I always had dreams of making music and performing arts but my parents were the type that believed there was no money in it, subsequently they shut down my dreams early. There was no opportunity for me to express my artistic side and essentially I was forced to survive in my environment at home and the streets. My survival tactics in 2005 led me to a stern consequence I’ll never regret and am able to embrace NOW.   I have been a returning citizen since 2008 and during that time away I reflected on “if things were different in my life, how would it have effected my life”? Ever since that revelation, I have been compelled to dedicate my life to helping kids and youth that maybe in a similar position, and I don’t want them to lose their life or make malign choices because they feel there is no other option and/or because they also feel invincible.</p>
<p>My program is called M.A.Y.B.E (Men Assisting Young Brothers to Excel) and my focus is helping at risk youth through mentor-ship and changing lifestyles. My business slogan is “Prevention is better than Punishment”.  As a youth these days,“trying to fit in” is paramount and I believe is a cause for the youth delinquency and/or incarceration rate increasing.Thank you so much for your time and any donation ""BIG or small"" to help bring my dream to fruition is greatly appreciated!!!</p>

With constant support and workshops I believe this program will either change their lives or at least open their mind to change.  I am working with Maryland Juvenile Justice Department about attaining the kids in local school districts that are delinquent and also youth that are on probation. As the program grows there will be more fundraisers and incentives i will send to donators.and supporters.

After the devastating 7.8 magnitude earthquake and aftershocks felt in Nepal , hundreds of thousands of Nepalis desperately need access to power and light, essential for night-time security and staying in touch with their loved ones.
Greenlight Planet has teamed up with World Vision International to get Sun King™ solar lanterns and mobile phone chargers to families devastated by the earthquake and we need your help.
For $19, you’ll provide one family with a Sun King™ solar lantern and mobile phone charger, enabling them to move about safely after dark and stay connected with their loved ones. 100 percent of the funds raised will go towards providing and distributing Sun King lanterns to those in need.



What We Need & What You Get:Breakdown of the Campaign:
Our goal is to raise $30,000 to send 1,515 solar lights to Nepal with World Vision. These lights will be distributed to earthquake survivors.
By donating $19, you’ll provide a family with a light and mobile phone charger. For $38 dollars, you'll provide for two families, for $57 you'll provide for 3 families and so on and so forth.
If we don't reach our goal, lights will still be sent to Nepal, but the total amount will be less. We feel that providing close to 1,500 families with lights and mobile charging is a small feat and ultimately we hope to provide more than this.
The Impact:
Greenlight Planet has teamed up with World Vision, an organization with a proven track record in humanitarian and disaster relief. World Vision is dedicated to working with children, families and their communities worldwide to reach their full potential by tackling poverty and injustice.  
Greenlight Planet regularly works with humanitarian groups that need easily deployed, clean and reliable energy to operate where there is little to no infrastructure. We take tremendous pride in our ability to act quickly and effectively in the event of any disaster. 
With warehouses spread across the globe, Greenlight Planet is ready to ship at any time and can rush bulk shipments for disaster relief to any region of the globe. 
We are trusted partners of the United Nations, MFI’s, NGO’s and governments around the world. 
Greenlight Planet ranks in the top 10 percent among social businesses, has a five-star rating from the Global Impact Investing Rating System (GIIRS) and two B Corp awards.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>L’ONG
Cavoequiva est une organisation non gouvernementale créée le 23 mars 2003 dont
la mission essentielle est de<b> promouvoir le bien-être et la défense des
droits de l’Homme et en particulier ceux de l’Enfant et de la Femme à Abidjan,
Côte d'Ivoire. </b></p>
<p><b><u>LA SITUATION
ACTUELLE</u></b></p>
<p>L'ONG
s'occupe d'<b>accueillir des enfants et des jeunes filles en situation de
vulnérabilité suite à des abus  multiples.</b></p>
<p>La majorité
des filles recueillies ont été confiées par leur famille à des tutrices ou
tuteurs pour être scolarisées et mises en apprentissage. Cependant,
celles-ci  sont placées comme servantes, vendeuses d’eau, nounous, etc. et
sont exploitées et/ou maltraitées par des  patrons sans scrupule. Elles
quittent donc  le cadre familial de l'exploiteur et se retrouvent  à
la rue.</p>
<p>Une fois là,
elles doivent survivre, sans abri et sans la protection d’une famille. Elles
deviennent vulnérables à toutes sortes de risques tels que le viol dans
les marchés gares routières et  bidonvilles, le travail précaire, la consommation de drogues ou la prostitution
de survie. Cette dernière les expose alors au VIH /sida et/ou à des grossesses
précoces et indésirées.</p>
<p><b><u>LES ACTIONS
DE L'ONG</u></b></p>
<p>    Face à cette
situation de vulnérabilité des enfants et jeunes filles, l'ONG Cavoequiva :</p>
<p><b style=""background-color: initial;"">1. a mis en place un Centre de
     Transit Communautaire à Abidjan  qui assure :</b></p>
<ul>
<li>un hébergement temporaire (<b>3
     mois en moyenne)</b>
</li>
<li>une prise en charge holistique
     (aide psychosociale, sanitaire, alimentaire, hygiénique, vestimentaire,
      alphabétisation, apprentissage de métiers, activités culturelles...)</li>
</ul>
<p>  2.<b> apporte des solutions durables aux problèmes des mineures victimes
d’exploitation par :</b></p>
<ul>
<li>des sessions de compétences de
     vie pour développer leur<b> confiance en soi, leur estime de soi et leur affirmation de soi</b>
</li>
<li>des ateliers d'apprentissage
     professionnel en couture, pâtisserie, cuisine, art floral, crochet...</li>
<li>des actions de sensibilisation
     de proximité de jour et de nuit, et de masse dans les marchés, gares routières de la commune d'Adjamé </li>
<li>la recherche des familles, la
     médiation et la réunification familiale des enfants.</li>
</ul>
<p><b><u>LES DIFFICULTÉS</u></b><br/>
<br/>
L’ONG reçoit en moyenne cinq filles par semaine référées par la Sous-Direction
de la Police Criminelle, les Brigades de gendarmerie, les Centres Sociaux, la
communauté, l'ONUDC et l'ONUCI, etc.</p>
<p>Aujourd'hui,
<b>l’ONG ne dispose pas de capacité suffisante pour l’accueil des pensionnaires</b>
dont le nombre croît de jour en jour. <b>Les infrastructures actuelles sont
trop exiguës et ne répondent plus aux besoins de prise en charge des pensionnaires</b> : insuffisance des toilettes, de salles d’eau, de dortoirs,
manque de salles de jeux et de réfectoires.</p>
<p>Elle héberge
à ce jour 50 enfants et jeunes filles pour une capacité initiale de 16
pensionnaires.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Ce dont nous avons besoin et ce que vous obtenez</h3>
<ul>
</ul>
<div>
<p>L'ONG
Cavoequiva initie le projet <b>de réhabilitation et d'agrandissement</b> du Centre de Transit
Communautaire afin <b>d'augmenter ses capacités d'accueil à 48 pensionnaires
 en y adjoignant toutes les commodités à même de leur assurer des
conditions de vie et d'hygiène de bonne qualité.</b></p>
<p>Cela
permettra non seulement <b>d'offrir un environnement sécurisé et bienveillant</b> <b>aux enfants
et aux jeunes filles maltraitées le temps du séjour dans le centre de Transit (3 mois en moyenne) ;</b> leur donnant ainsi la possibilité de
quitter l'univers dangereux de la rue mais aussi de leur<b> fournir un cadre à
même de les aider dans la construction de leur personnalité et de leur vie le temps de faire la recherche, la médiation et la réunification familiale</b>.</p>
<p>Pour ce faire, nous avons besoin d'un montant de 200 000 $ qui va permettre de réhabiliter le centre qui est actuellement une maison basse en un immeuble d'un étage comprenant l'ensemble des services : salle de soins , dortoirs, salle d'écoute, réfectoires, <span style=""background-color: initial;"">cuisine, salle de jeux, salle de lecture, salles de cours, sanitaires et bureaux...</span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Au cas où l'objectif ne serait pas atteint, nous ne réhabiliterons que le rez-de-chaussée et poursuivrons la recherche de fonds pour le 1er étage. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Nous envisageons de dédier une des salles à tous nos donateurs et à toutes nos donatrices en y gravant leurs noms et de publier la liste de nos bienfaiteurs et bienfaitrices sur notre site internet <a href=""http://www.ongcavoequiva.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ongcavoequiva.org</a></span></p>

<p><b>Votre don
permettra :</b></p>
<ol>
<li>d'assurer, pierre par
     pierre,  la <b>réhabilitation concrète et immédiate</b> du Centre de
     Transit Communautaire, dont les nouveaux plans architecturaux ont déjà été
     réalisés</li>
<li>de garantir la <b>sécurité
     matérielle et affective</b> des enfants et jeunes filles vulnérables</li>
<li>de contribuer à la <b>réinsertion</b>
     de ces enfants et jeunes filles dans leurs familles</li>
<li>d'offrir aux pensionnaires, le
     temps de leur séjour au centre, un accès à<b> l'alphabétisation et à la
     formation professionnelle</b>
</li>
<li>de <b>redonner le sourire</b> à
     des enfants et à des jeunes filles blessées dans leur innocence en les
     réintégrant dans leur famille.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Pourquoi nous financer ?</b></p>
<p>Les centres
d'hébergement temporaire ou de transit pour les enfants et les jeunes filles
vulnérables sont presque inexistants à Abidjan (Côte d'Ivoire). Il est donc
très important de soutenir notre structure afin de pérenniser nos actions et de sauver de nombreuses vies innocentes.</p>
<p><b>L'ONG Cavoequiva est bien implantée localement et a noué des partenariats avec des institutions internationales reconnues telles que Save the Children, ONUDC (Office des nations Unies contre la Drogue et la criminalité), Salevry Fund (Haut Commissariat des Nations Unies), la Fondation de Francen UNFPA (Fonds des nations Unies pour la Population...)</b></p>
<p>De
 2011 à 2015 grâce à notre travail de terrain, nous avons <b>recueilli 350 enfants et jeunes filles</b> vulnérables et <b>réunifié  255 d'entre elles</b>.</p>
<p>Nos actions
répondent à des <b>besoins immédiats de mise en sécurité et de reconstruction
des enfants et jeunes filles, dans une perspective de respect des droits
humains et d'émancipation de la  femme.</b></p>
<p>Au début,
nous accueillions les mineures vulnérables uniquement la journée. Mais, face
aux dangers de viol et de mauvais traitements auxquels elles étaient exposées
la nuit sur les sites de vulnérabilité, il nous est apparu urgent  de
mettre en place <b>un Centre de Transit Communautaire assurant une protection globale. </b></p>

L’ONG
Cavoequiva est une organisation non gouvernementale créée le 23 mars 2003 dont
la mission essentielle est de promouvoir le bien-être et la défense des
droits de l’Homme et en particulier ceux de l’Enfant et de la Femme à Abidjan,
Côte d'Ivoire. 
LA SITUATION
ACTUELLE
L'ONG
s'occupe d'accueillir des enfants et des jeunes filles en situation de
vulnérabilité suite à des abus  multiples.
La majorité
des filles recueillies ont été confiées par leur famille à des tutrices ou
tuteurs pour être scolarisées et mises en apprentissage. Cependant,
celles-ci  sont placées comme servantes, vendeuses d’eau, nounous, etc. et
sont exploitées et/ou maltraitées par des  patrons sans scrupule. Elles
quittent donc  le cadre familial de l'exploiteur et se retrouvent  à
la rue.
Une fois là,
elles doivent survivre, sans abri et sans la protection d’une famille. Elles
deviennent vulnérables à toutes sortes de risques tels que le viol dans
les marchés gares routières et  bidonvilles, le travail précaire, la consommation de drogues ou la prostitution
de survie. Cette dernière les expose alors au VIH /sida et/ou à des grossesses
précoces et indésirées.
LES ACTIONS
DE L'ONG
    Face à cette
situation de vulnérabilité des enfants et jeunes filles, l'ONG Cavoequiva :
1. a mis en place un Centre de
     Transit Communautaire à Abidjan  qui assure :

un hébergement temporaire (3
     mois en moyenne)

une prise en charge holistique
     (aide psychosociale, sanitaire, alimentaire, hygiénique, vestimentaire,
      alphabétisation, apprentissage de métiers, activités culturelles...)

  2. apporte des solutions durables aux problèmes des mineures victimes
d’exploitation par :

des sessions de compétences de
     vie pour développer leur confiance en soi, leur estime de soi et leur affirmation de soi

des ateliers d'apprentissage
     professionnel en couture, pâtisserie, cuisine, art floral, crochet...
des actions de sensibilisation
     de proximité de jour et de nuit, et de masse dans les marchés, gares routières de la commune d'Adjamé 
la recherche des familles, la
     médiation et la réunification familiale des enfants.

LES DIFFICULTÉS

L’ONG reçoit en moyenne cinq filles par semaine référées par la Sous-Direction
de la Police Criminelle, les Brigades de gendarmerie, les Centres Sociaux, la
communauté, l'ONUDC et l'ONUCI, etc.
Aujourd'hui,
l’ONG ne dispose pas de capacité suffisante pour l’accueil des pensionnaires
dont le nombre croît de jour en jour. Les infrastructures actuelles sont
trop exiguës et ne répondent plus aux besoins de prise en charge des pensionnaires : insuffisance des toilettes, de salles d’eau, de dortoirs,
manque de salles de jeux et de réfectoires.
Elle héberge
à ce jour 50 enfants et jeunes filles pour une capacité initiale de 16
pensionnaires.

Ce dont nous avons besoin et ce que vous obtenez



L'ONG
Cavoequiva initie le projet de réhabilitation et d'agrandissement du Centre de Transit
Communautaire afin d'augmenter ses capacités d'accueil à 48 pensionnaires
 en y adjoignant toutes les commodités à même de leur assurer des
conditions de vie et d'hygiène de bonne qualité.
Cela
permettra non seulement d'offrir un environnement sécurisé et bienveillant aux enfants
et aux jeunes filles maltraitées le temps du séjour dans le centre de Transit (3 mois en moyenne) ; leur donnant ainsi la possibilité de
quitter l'univers dangereux de la rue mais aussi de leur fournir un cadre à
même de les aider dans la construction de leur personnalité et de leur vie le temps de faire la recherche, la médiation et la réunification familiale.
Pour ce faire, nous avons besoin d'un montant de 200 000 $ qui va permettre de réhabiliter le centre qui est actuellement une maison basse en un immeuble d'un étage comprenant l'ensemble des services : salle de soins , dortoirs, salle d'écoute, réfectoires, cuisine, salle de jeux, salle de lecture, salles de cours, sanitaires et bureaux...
Au cas où l'objectif ne serait pas atteint, nous ne réhabiliterons que le rez-de-chaussée et poursuivrons la recherche de fonds pour le 1er étage. 
Nous envisageons de dédier une des salles à tous nos donateurs et à toutes nos donatrices en y gravant leurs noms et de publier la liste de nos bienfaiteurs et bienfaitrices sur notre site internet www.ongcavoequiva.org
L'impact






Votre don
permettra :

d'assurer, pierre par
     pierre,  la réhabilitation concrète et immédiate du Centre de
     Transit Communautaire, dont les nouveaux plans architecturaux ont déjà été
     réalisés
de garantir la sécurité
     matérielle et affective des enfants et jeunes filles vulnérables
de contribuer à la réinsertion
     de ces enfants et jeunes filles dans leurs familles
d'offrir aux pensionnaires, le
     temps de leur séjour au centre, un accès à l'alphabétisation et à la
     formation professionnelle

de redonner le sourire à
     des enfants et à des jeunes filles blessées dans leur innocence en les
     réintégrant dans leur famille.

Pourquoi nous financer ?
Les centres
d'hébergement temporaire ou de transit pour les enfants et les jeunes filles
vulnérables sont presque inexistants à Abidjan (Côte d'Ivoire). Il est donc
très important de soutenir notre structure afin de pérenniser nos actions et de sauver de nombreuses vies innocentes.
L'ONG Cavoequiva est bien implantée localement et a noué des partenariats avec des institutions internationales reconnues telles que Save the Children, ONUDC (Office des nations Unies contre la Drogue et la criminalité), Salevry Fund (Haut Commissariat des Nations Unies), la Fondation de Francen UNFPA (Fonds des nations Unies pour la Population...)
De
 2011 à 2015 grâce à notre travail de terrain, nous avons recueilli 350 enfants et jeunes filles vulnérables et réunifié  255 d'entre elles.
Nos actions
répondent à des besoins immédiats de mise en sécurité et de reconstruction
des enfants et jeunes filles, dans une perspective de respect des droits
humains et d'émancipation de la  femme.
Au début,
nous accueillions les mineures vulnérables uniquement la journée. Mais, face
aux dangers de viol et de mauvais traitements auxquels elles étaient exposées
la nuit sur les sites de vulnérabilité, il nous est apparu urgent  de
mettre en place un Centre de Transit Communautaire assurant une protection globale. 


Risques et défis


Les défis à relever, c'est d'arriver à réhabiliter et à équiper le Centre de Transit Communautaire de l'ONG Cavoequiva et d'en faire un centre de référence pour enfants et jeunes filles vulnérables en Côte d'Ivoire d'autant plus que le manque est criard. Nous pensons être en mesure de relever ces défis grâce à notre expérience dans le domaine et notre parfaite connaissance du terrain. Egalement, avec notre forte collaboration avec les structures étatiques et la communauté, l'ONG Cavoequiva est  bien intégrée dans le milieu associatif en Côte d'Ivoire.
Les risques ou obstacles auxquels nous pourrions être confrontés dans l'atteinte des objectifs ,c'est d'être confronté après la réhabilitation à une sollicitation très importante des structures référentes à laquelle nous ne pourrions pas faire face  vu que nous aurions un effectif bien déterminé à prendre en charge à la fois et un budget conséquent.
Pour palier ces difficultés, nous poursuivrons la mobilisation des fonds pour la prise en charge de ces enfants et optimiserons les recherches familiales  afin de réinsérer le maximum d'enfants en un temps record .

How important is it to try and
educate the public about wolves? Extremely important. Although wolves are on
the Endangered Species List, members of Congress, the Department of the
Interior, and the US Fish &amp; Wildlife Service have succumbed to pressure by
special interest groups to implement policies allowing the circumvention of ESL
protection. In 2011, when <b><a href=""http://www.defenders.org/the-war-on-wolves/infographic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">wolves first lost their protection</a></b>, more than 2600
wolves out of a population of only 5000 were killed in the first two years.
Hunting season in 2015 began on August 31, and brutal methods like
trapping, gassing, and the use of dogs (which were outlawed decades ago) have
been reapproved to target wolves. Hunting season has been extended to kill
pregnant females and to allow the poisoning of pups before they can reach
adulthood, which will devastate entire packs.<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441359910/efeywv453qccxx3qs7zs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<b><a href=""http://www.shadowlandfoundation.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Shadowland Foundation</a></b> strives to
educate the citizens of wolf hunting states, along with the general population,
so that they realize both that the eradication of wolves is cruel and
unnecessary, and also that the loss of wolves is harmful to the states they
formerly inhabited. In addition to ecological concerns, there is a financial
matter at stake for these states. In <b><a href=""http://earthjustice.org/features/infographic-wolves-keep-yellowstone-in-the-balance"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2010 in Yellowstone Park</a></b> alone, almost a
million and a half dollars was generated in eco-tourism, and almost half of
this was attributed specifically to the presence of wolves. By educating people
about wolves and the benefit they bring, we can make a difference.

How important is it to try and
educate the public about wolves? Extremely important. Although wolves are on
the Endangered Species List, members of Congress, the Department of the
Interior, and the US Fish & Wildlife Service have succumbed to pressure by
special interest groups to implement policies allowing the circumvention of ESL
protection. In 2011, when wolves first lost their protection, more than 2600
wolves out of a population of only 5000 were killed in the first two years.
Hunting season in 2015 began on August 31, and brutal methods like
trapping, gassing, and the use of dogs (which were outlawed decades ago) have
been reapproved to target wolves. Hunting season has been extended to kill
pregnant females and to allow the poisoning of pups before they can reach
adulthood, which will devastate entire packs.
Shadowland Foundation strives to
educate the citizens of wolf hunting states, along with the general population,
so that they realize both that the eradication of wolves is cruel and
unnecessary, and also that the loss of wolves is harmful to the states they
formerly inhabited. In addition to ecological concerns, there is a financial
matter at stake for these states. In 2010 in Yellowstone Park alone, almost a
million and a half dollars was generated in eco-tourism, and almost half of
this was attributed specifically to the presence of wolves. By educating people
about wolves and the benefit they bring, we can make a difference.",30.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I am Daisy Arcilla Brett-Holt, a
British-Filipino chairman of Worldwide Philippine Jury Initiative (WPJI).  Being a dual citizen, I thought it best to
register WPJI as a non-government association both in UK and the Philippines.  My 30-year residence in the UK has shown me how
life could be meaningful, productive and comfortable for me and my family.  The significant contrast between lives in my two
countries made me search for the reason why. 
This is what I found out _ the difference between British and Filipino attitudes to the legal system is due to the ingrained effect on the British of the Jury System.</p>
<p>So, what is or is not in the
Filipino culture that makes the people who and what they are?  The simple answer is _ the absence of a Jury
System!  I could not believe it at first;
but as I analysed the situation, I became convinced that this time tested Jury System made the big difference between the Filipino and the English
cultures, and as such the difference in these two kinds of people.</p>
<p>What the Filipinos have instead
of the jury system is a Single-Judge System.  Everyone knows that even a well-meaning judge can be easily bribed or
coerced.  But why have not the Filipinos
changed this system?  The answer is :_ their leaders. The American colonizers imposed their constitution in 1902.  The jury system was omitted because they wanted to keep power out of the hands of ordinary Filipinos!  Since then, similarly, Filipino leaders wanted to monopolize the political and judicial powers to themselves.  They succeeded by keeping the people ignorant of their laws, rights and responsibilities. </p>
<p>Only a jury system where the
ordinary citizens have the final say whether to keep or sack their representatives in government can address this imbalance in power.  Winston Churchill once said, ""Only as long as juries of ordinary citizens have the final say, the government remains the servant, not the master of the people"".</p>
<p>I would like to share with my
fellow Filipinos the blessings God has given me and the only way I can do it is
by teaching the Jury System to the youth of the country who will benefit from this
knowledge and  affect the ""change"" majority
of the Filipino people so wanted.</p>
<p>On the 15<sup>th</sup> of July 2015,
the Chairperson of Commission on Higher Education in the Philippines endorsed our National Information Tour on the Jury
System for Filipinos.  In conjunction
with the information tour, WPJI also has to gather 7 Million signatures out of
56 Million registered voters.  The
signatures are pre-requisite to a National Referendum on the adoption of the
jury system in the Philippine judiciary.</p>
<p>Your donations will help us
tremendously as we tour the 234 Congressional Districts spread out in the 7100
islands of the Philippines.</p>

Kripalu and New Theatre are linking up to do a staged reading about an actress who has just been cast in the role of HAMLET and yet she has a BLOCK. The question of to BE or not to BE hits on many levels and as we follow the actress through her journey. We hope to express   how understanding ones self is of utmost importance when choosing your roles both on and off stage.

South Florida's Hit Play Women Playing Hamlet is headed to Kripalu in the Berkshires!

A new twist on Hamlet will heat up the Berkshires this summer at a first-of-its-kind event

Christine Dolen of The Miami Herald called Women Playing Hamlet “engaging” and “graceful”
and 


Bill Hirschman of FloridaTheatreOnStage noted it as “a very funny play...digs deeply into
that alchemical process when an actor draws on their own life experience to create a creature
nearly impossible to discern as a character in a play on a stage.”

For two years, Beatrice Mbai, a Redd School teacher (in Houston, Texas), originally from Kenya, has been doing small book drives for the small village of Nduriri, in central Kenya where her grandfather and father grew up.  

 It is an extremely impoverished area. Children walk miles to school, often without shoes or food for lunch.  The two schools (about 600 students) in the area are barely funded by the government so the families must pay tuition, and buy uniforms. Most families barely make it. Books are a luxury, even at school, so we started out just trying to help  Beatrice by hosting a book drive.  



Redd school has done many giving things over the years. This
year alone they have run two food drives, a campaign for Toys for Tots and donated some books to a poor school in Houston. Because Beatrice is a teacher there and everyone knows her, the kids were touched and motivated to help make a difference.

<p>Bullying is a massive problem in ALL schools world-wide. At least 1 out of every 2 kids is bullied at school. And the impact can be devastating - socially,
emotionally, low self-esteem, poor academic performance, and even suicide. In
fact, the latest research has even shown that bullying at school is worse for
kids than being abused at home, in terms of depression and committing self-harm.
And studies show that the damage due to bullying is long-term.</p>
<p>My husband Gavin and I have seen first-hand the effects of bullying on
both of our two young kids. We’ve also seen how ineffective the traditional
solutions have been – from useless posters and rubber bands creating awareness,
to SMS lines that don’t achieve results. And the biggest problem is that most bullying
goes unreported. Face-to-face conversations are difficult and embarrassing, and
kids are afraid the bully, their friends or other kids will find out that
they’ve told an adult. And on top of that, they don't know how that
adult will react.</p>
<p>So we’ve created BeatingBullies, a technology solution that works. It
enables kids to report and discuss bullying anonymously with authority figures at their school (such as the principal or school counsellor), to
upload evidence such as pictures or videos to support their claim, and to get
the issues resolved. </p>
We need your help to put a
stop to the global bullying epidemic, to give as many kids as possible the
opportunity to live without the stress of a bully ruining their lives. <p></p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>

</div></div>","Project Summary
The schools water project is aimed at providing clean water access to children in rural communities across Africa. We believe that every child deserves the right to have access to clean water supply. As C&J Accounting, we are offering professional project management. We have over 40 years operational experience in Africa and  we decided to come up with a solution to help rural children have access to clean water. 
It involves the drilling of boreholes that can supply water all year round, installation of solar panels, tank stand and in addition to that a hectare of drip irrigation equipment, so that the children can as well get a good diet from produce harvested from the school garden.

 We could not let our children continue to die of water borne diseases as well as a malnutrition, we then decided to offer a solution to that by introducing the schools water project. The project has so far benefited over 5 000 children in the schools that we have done.

way to improve self-awareness and environmental consciousness. It puts the focus on the promotion of the children's potentials as a key
to a free and self-determined life and as creation as a way of gaining and

<p></p>
<p>We use arts for the stimulation of all the senses and thus a sensible and intellectual experience. <br/></p>
<p>We understand creation as a way of expressing out thoughts and feeling and the opportunity to speak in pictures.<br/></p>
<ul></ul>
<p>The three main features that will be developed in the art education - curiosity, the ability of percipience and creativity - will build the base for the wide range of social, practical and theoretical skills the children will need in
their future lives as free, independent persons. The children will learn to:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>detect problems and find alternative solutions <br/>
</li>
<li>think in an independent and
     alternative way</li>
<li>perceive their environment
     &amp; themselves</li>

<p><b>Kunst für Bildung</b></p>
<p>Das Projekt bietet künstlerische Erziehung im Bildungszentrum Tarrafal, für
rund 260 Kinder und Jugendliche aus schwachen finanziellen und sozialen Verhältnissen,
an. Das Zentrum wird seit 2004 von<a href=""http://deltacultura.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> Delta Cultura</a> betrieben.   <br/>
Zwei Künstler, Ulli Seidel und Alejandro García Rosado werden die täglichen
Programme leiten und einen Jugendlichen ausbilden der die künstlerische
Erziehung nach dem Ende ihres Aufenthaltes weiterführen wird.<br/>Der Kunstunterricht wird von September 2015 bis August 2016 stattfinden und
wird garantieren, dass die künstlerische Erziehung ein permanenter Teil der
Bildungsprogramme des Zentrums wird. </p>

We use arts for the stimulation of all the senses and thus a sensible and intellectual experience. 
We understand creation as a way of expressing out thoughts and feeling and the opportunity to speak in pictures.

The three main features that will be developed in the art education - curiosity, the ability of percipience and creativity - will build the base for the wide range of social, practical and theoretical skills the children will need in
their future lives as free, independent persons. The children will learn to:

detect problems and find alternative solutions 

think in an independent and
     alternative way
perceive their environment
     & themselves
work on their own and in groups


  Information about Cape Verde 

Cape
Verde or Capeverdean Islands are 15 islands on the west coast of Africa. They are  independent from Portugal since 1975.
Cape Verde and the population suffer from many different problems:

lack of mineral resources
bad agricultural conditions and therefore more than 90% of its
products imported
one of the world's highest
emigration rates (brain drain) 

rising living costs
very high youth unemployment 

increasing division between the rich and the poor 

growing rate of criminality 


Improving education by art and more is a promising way to help the children to a better future.

Kunst für Bildung
Das Projekt bietet künstlerische Erziehung im Bildungszentrum Tarrafal, für
rund 260 Kinder und Jugendliche aus schwachen finanziellen und sozialen Verhältnissen,
an. Das Zentrum wird seit 2004 von Delta Cultura betrieben.   
Zwei Künstler, Ulli Seidel und Alejandro García Rosado werden die täglichen
Programme leiten und einen Jugendlichen ausbilden der die künstlerische
Erziehung nach dem Ende ihres Aufenthaltes weiterführen wird.Der Kunstunterricht wird von September 2015 bis August 2016 stattfinden und
wird garantieren, dass die künstlerische Erziehung ein permanenter Teil der
Bildungsprogramme des Zentrums wird. 


Was gelingt mit eurer Hilfe 


260 Kinder bekommen ein Jahr lang künstlerische Erziehung 
eine Ausstellung mit den Arbeiten der Kinder in Tarrafal oder einem anderen
Orten der Insel Santiago wird stattfinden. 
die Betreuerinnen und Betreuer des Zentrums werden zum Thema “Kunst als
Bildungsmethode” weitergebildet. 
eine Person aus Tarrafal wird zum Kunstlehrer ab 2016 ausgebildet
die beiden Künstler werden unterstützt, damit sie bis August 2016 bleiben
können

16900 USD bedeuten 61 USD pro Kind, bedeuten 260 Spender…
Wir sind dankbar für alle Beiträge, egal wie klein oder gross.




Mehr über die künstlerische Erziehung


Kunst für Bildung verwendet Kunst als eine Möglichkeit, die Selbstwahrnehmung und das
Umweltbewusstsein der Kinder zu verbessern. Es setzt auf potenzialfördernde Bildung als Schlüssel zu
einem freieren und selbstbestimmteren Leben, sowie auf Kreation als Methode zum
Wissenserwerb und zum Ausdruck von Wissen.
Wir nutzen die Kunst um alle Sinne anzuregen und damit Lernen zu einer sensiblen
und intellektuellen Erfahrung wird. 
Wir verstehen die Kreation als eine Möglichkeit Gedanken und Gefühle
auszudrücken und als Möglichkeit, in Bildern zu sprechen. 
Die drei Haupteigenschaften, die in der künstlerischen Erziehung entwickelt
werden – Neugierde, Wahrnehmungsfähigkeit und Kreativität – werden die Basis
für eine Fülle an sozialen, praktischen und theoretischen Fähigkeiten sein, die
die Kinder in ihrem Leben als freie, unabhängige Personen benötigen werden. 
Die Kinder werden lernen: 


Probleme zu entdecken und alternative Lösungen zu ersinnen
alternativ und frei zu denken
sich selber und ihre Umwelt wahrzunehmen
selbstständig und in der Gruppe zu arbeiten


Information über die Kapverden 

Kapverde oder die Kapverdischen Inseln sind 15 Inseln an der Westküste Afrikas.
Sie sind seit 1975 unabhängig von Portugal.

Kapverde und ihre Einwohner haben mit vielen
verschiedenen Problemen zu kämpfen:


Das Fehlen an Bodenschäzen und schlechte Bedingung für Landwirtschaft verursachen eine Importrate von 90% aller Produkte
Eine der höchsten
Emigrationsraten der Welt (brain drain)

 Steigende Lebenskosten

Sehr hohe Jugendarbeitslosigkeit
Immer weiter auseinanderklaffende
Schere zwischen Reich und Arm
Steigende Kriminalitätsrate

Bildung durch Kunst zu verbessern, ist ein
vielversprechender Weg, den Kindern zu einer besseren Zukunft zu verhelfen.

Have you ever wanted to get started with Free and Open Source Software but couldn't find clear easy to follow documentation to get you started?  The end goal of the project is to create easy to follow videos and documentation that will be freely available to the community to help get you started with Free and Open Source Software.

Many Free and Open Source tools are fantastic tools but have a lack of easily accessible materials to help get people started with them.  We plan to try to help correct this by primarily producing video content that users will be able to use to help get them started in using these tools.  The videos will be released under a Creative Commons license to allow the community to use them widely.

Examples of what we will cover.

We hope to cover many topics that will be of interest to a new user but some of our initial plans for releases will be.


Installing Linux inside of VirtualBox
Howto update a Linux System
Howto install new software
Removing software
Command Line system updates
Command Line software installiation

The team will also have to pay for food. Our goal is to make this trip completely free for all team members so that everyone has the financial ability to attend. </p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, we may only be able to send a few team members. This is to be avoided at all costs, since everyone had a role in our victory. We should be able to <i>borrow</i> enough money for the trip, but we will need campaign money to replenish our program's funds so that we can continue our outreach and compete next year. </p>

What will the fund go towards? We are FRC Team 1711 from Central High school. We are involved in FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) and compete in an annual challenge in which we must design and build a robot that completes a game. You can learn more about FIRST and the championship event here.
This year, we qualified for the Michigan State Championship. For the first time ever, we WON. And also for the first time ever, we qualified for the world competition.
But our challenges do not end there. We now need YOUR support to help us get there!   What We Need, and Why We Need It We need at least $5000 dollars to get to St. Louis for Championships.  We are renting a charter bus to travel which will cost us thousands of dollars. The team will also have to pay for food. Our goal is to make this trip completely free for all team members so that everyone has the financial ability to attend. 
If we do not reach our goal, we may only be able to send a few team members. This is to be avoided at all costs, since everyone had a role in our victory. We should be able to borrow enough money for the trip, but we will need campaign money to replenish our program's funds so that we can continue our outreach and compete next year. 
If by some miracle we exceed our goal and funding for the event, additional money will go towards funding next years' robot and our numerous outreach programs.

About the Team and STEAMWhy do we inspire STEAM in students and in our community?Just as steam powers a locomotive, STEAM drives us to empower our school and community.Science is critical to our broad understanding of tasks and goals. We find Technology companies in our community and our mentors help us apply the newest technology to our projects. Engineering is at the heart of all we do. From designing a robot or building our pit area to making a sign for a local festival, we approach every project as an engineering design challenge. Our media, public relations, and outreach rely on Art. We are proud to have talented student writers and artists who are a critical part of our team. Mathematics lies behind everything. It is the means by which we create a well-oiled team. We don’t stop at building. We use calculus to calculate stress on a support truss and to measure a vector on a logo design.Through STEAM we positively influence our team members and those around them to do pursue great things. As part of FIRST, the RAPTORS offer an experience that goes above and beyond other high school activities. Our FIRST program to includes all kinds of learning, from CAD design to public relations. By teaching lifelong skills like how to creatively solve a problem, work within deadlines, and work together to mutually achieve a goal, we develop well-rounded world-ready individuals. Our team is structured to promote Gracious Professionalism and Coopertition as well as to inspire students to take leadership and responsibility. Even though we are a ‘robotics team’, our goal is to inspire students to do great things. The robot is the robots though: for ten years now we have been instilling the drive to serve our school and community in our members. By participating in countless volunteering events and advancing awareness for engineering in our community, our team has turned into a community presence. This team is about what you learn, not what you win. We are the varsity sport of the mind, and always put teamwork over competition. Our team is built on the foundation of putting others first, creating a community of world-ready people.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Little did I know, this friend request would end up being much more than that. Semion was already friends with a colleague of mine, Dave Brown, so I asked Dave about their relationship. Known to most as Super Dave, he said that he met Semion on a mission and that he is a school teacher. Being a teacher myself, I soon realized the potential that this connection could hold for my students at Boonville Middle School. </p>
<p>Semion and I began to communicate on a daily basis by sharing blessings and talking about our daily lives. This friendly exchange developed into much more <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">when we decided to have our students exchange letters. This exchange is on its third round and all of our students are really enjoying it! The friendships and cultural awareness are just a sample of the amazing outcomes for my students.</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Following the success of our letter exchanges, Semion and his colleagues decided to change their school name to match ours. They are now called the Boonville Parents School Maanyi (be sure to explore their website at <a href=""http://www.maanyiparentsug.org)."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.maanyiparentsug.org).</a> We now have a special bond between our schools and the students of Boonville Middle School want to help Semion and his students continue their success. </span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p>Many of Semion's students are orphans and live at the school. Their current need is to build a hostel for their female students (see video for tour of current hostel). They are currently building this hostel but have run out of finances to complete the construction. Semion has expressed that they will need $8000 to finish the construction. A fellow teacher, Beth Farrand, and I have already secured $500 through a grant from GenerationOn and my students raised nearly $300 in the last week of school. One students collected over $100 from her softball teammates!</p>
<p>If the project video is unable to convince you then, perhaps Semion himself will personally share with you the impact this hostel will have for his students. I would be glad to put anyone in touch with him. He has promised to send updates of the construction and has already sent photos of the progress they have made with our recent $800 donation. <br/></p>
<p>If we do not reach our goal, we will still donate all money raised to help with the construction of the girl's hostel. On the other hand, if we are able to raise more money than our goal, I would like to put that towards a trip that will bring Semion to visit our school in November. We are already preparing arrangements for this journey and I believe it would be a nice surprise for this great man. </p>
<p>Perks for our donors are as follows: </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>$1 donation will receive email updates with pictures and video to show progress of the construction of the girl's hostel.</li>
<li>$25 donation will receive a ""thank you"" email from Semion. </li>
<li>$50 donation will receive a ""thank you"" letter from Semion. </li>
<li>$100 donation will receive email updates and a personalized ""shout out"" in a thank you video. </li>
<li>$500 donation will receive email updates and a ""school applause"" from the entire school along with your ""shout out."" See the campaign video for example. </li>

</h3>
</div><div> <p>There are no risks to this campaign. My students already raised $800 and we have sent that money safely to Semion. The campaign photo album has pictures of the materials invoice and progress resulting from this donation. The work was done immediately and evidence of their progress was returned promptly. </p>
<p>Any money raised in this campaign, no matter the amount, will help this school build a girl's hostel. The school is worried about potential storm damage to the already completed portions if the construction is not completed soon. </p>
<p>The best way to make an impact is to raise this money as soon as possible and help them finish the construction and avoid further setbacks.</p>

Being a teacher myself, I soon realized the potential that this connection could hold for my students at Boonville Middle School. 
Semion and I began to communicate on a daily basis by sharing blessings and talking about our daily lives. This friendly exchange developed into much more when we decided to have our students exchange letters. This exchange is on its third round and all of our students are really enjoying it! The friendships and cultural awareness are just a sample of the amazing outcomes for my students.
Following the success of our letter exchanges, Semion and his colleagues decided to change their school name to match ours. They are now called the Boonville Parents School Maanyi (be sure to explore their website at www.maanyiparentsug.org). We now have a special bond between our schools and the students of Boonville Middle School want to help Semion and his students continue their success. 
What We Need & What You Get
 Many of Semion's students are orphans and live at the school. Their current need is to build a hostel for their female students (see video for tour of current hostel). They are currently building this hostel but have run out of finances to complete the construction. Semion has expressed that they will need $8000 to finish the construction. A fellow teacher, Beth Farrand, and I have already secured $500 through a grant from GenerationOn and my students raised nearly $300 in the last week of school. One students collected over $100 from her softball teammates!
If the project video is unable to convince you then, perhaps Semion himself will personally share with you the impact this hostel will have for his students. I would be glad to put anyone in touch with him. He has promised to send updates of the construction and has already sent photos of the progress they have made with our recent $800 donation. 
If we do not reach our goal, we will still donate all money raised to help with the construction of the girl's hostel. On the other hand, if we are able to raise more money than our goal, I would like to put that towards a trip that will bring Semion to visit our school in November. We are already preparing arrangements for this journey and I believe it would be a nice surprise for this great man. 
Perks for our donors are as follows: 


$1 donation will receive email updates with pictures and video to show progress of the construction of the girl's hostel.
$25 donation will receive a ""thank you"" email from Semion. 
$50 donation will receive a ""thank you"" letter from Semion. 
$100 donation will receive email updates and a personalized ""shout out"" in a thank you video. 
$500 donation will receive email updates and a ""school applause"" from the entire school along with your ""shout out."" See the campaign video for example. 
$1000 donation will receive email updates and a personalized video from the Boonville Parents School Maanyi. 

    
Risks & Challenges

 There are no risks to this campaign. My students already raised $800 and we have sent that money safely to Semion. The campaign photo album has pictures of the materials invoice and progress resulting from this donation. The work was done immediately and evidence of their progress was returned promptly. 
Any money raised in this campaign, no matter the amount, will help this school build a girl's hostel. The school is worried about potential storm damage to the already completed portions if the construction is not completed soon. 
The best way to make an impact is to raise this money as soon as possible and help them finish the construction and avoid further setbacks.
    Other Ways You Can Help Share our campaign with friends and family. Getting the word out is just as important as your donation. Thanks for your interest in our campaign and any support you are able to give!",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>Making Waves Winnipeg, founded in 2011, is a charitable organization that provides affordable one-on-one swimming instruction to children with special needs. </p>
<p>Ten of our private swimming lessons cost $20. Here's why: </p>
<p>Disabled children are at high risk of drowning - it's the second most common cause of injury-related death in children, with disabled children being ten times more likely to drown. Families supporting a child with special needs are more likely to be living in poverty.  Group-structured swimming lessons, while financially accessible for many families, do not allow children with special needs to get the attention they need to swim to the best of their ability. Private swimming lessons, while giving these children the attention they need, are not financially accessible for many families. </p>
<p>Children who are most in need of private swimming lessons face many financial barriers to obtaining that swimming instruction. </p>
<p>This is why we're making waves. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Financial Information</h3>
<p>So where does your money go? </p>
<p>Making Waves is primarily a volunteer-run organization. We're students who believe in making a difference in our community and we need your help.  </p>
<p>Your donation will go towards pool rentals and swimming equipment to provide the best lessons we possibly can. Our swimmers sometimes require adapted equipment so that they can all perform to the best of their ability - this equipment will be covered by your generous donations. </p>
<p>We are also running a two-week summer camp this August! This will allow 62 children to have a one-on-one camp experience. Our incredible summer staff are ready to create the best possible camp that we can, while still maintaining our goals of accessibility and affordability. Our camp costs $50 for one week, but costs us $550 per child to run. We need the support of donors like you to make this project a reality! </p>

Background

Monday the 27th of April 35 bus lines in Copenhagen drove out in the capitals streets with a new advertising whose purpose is to draw attention on the illegality of Israeli settlement products in Denmark, Europe as well as in international context. The campaign urges the consumers to avoid settlement products and it also urges food importers to abide by EU legislation concerning the labelling of settlement products.


Above is the campaign ad where Charlotte & Lizzie from Hellerup (one of the richest suburbs of Copenhagen) say;
“Our conscience is clear! We neither buy products from the Israeli settlements nor do we invest in the settlement industry”

Baggrund
Mandag morgen 27. april kørte 35 københavnske bus linjer ud på københavns gader, med reklamer for en ny kampagne, hvis formål er at gøre opmærksom på ulovligheden af Israelske bosættelser i dansk, i EU såvel som i international sammenhæng. Kampagnen opfordrer således forbrugerne til at undgå bosættelsesprodukter, samt fødevareimportører til at overholdelse EU-lovgivningen vedr. mærking af bosættelsesprodukter.
----------------------------------------------------Movia shuts down the campaignAfter 4 days and around 100 complaints, most of them in english and identical, the Israeli ambassador turning up in person the day of the board meeting and the far rightwing-politician Finn Rudaizkys personal approach to a board member, the board voted, except one member, to stop the campaign immediately starting May 1st this year.
Movia lukker kampagnen ned
Efter 4 dage og omkring 100 klager, langt de fleste på engelsk og enslydende, den Israelske ambassadørs troppen op samme dag som bestyrelsesmødet samt DF-politikeren Finn Rudaizkys personlige henvendelse til et medlem af bestyrelsen, stemte bestyrelsen, på nær et medlem, for at standse kampagnen med øjeblikkelig virkning fra og med 1. maj 2015. 

----------------------------------------------------
The reaction to Movia's censorship 

This has given rise to national and international concern and indignation along with massive media coverage. A protest web page established on Facebook is encouraging people to send Movia their complaints. The campaign is VERY content with all the publicity that money can't buy and the overwhelming support resulting from events. It is about freedom of expression and thus about getting the advertisements back on the busses in Copenhagen where they belong in accordance to the original agreement with Movia.


Reaktion på censuren 
Dette har vakt stor national og international undren og forargelse samt massiv mediedækning.  Der er blevet oprettet en protestside på facebook, der opfordrer folk til at klage til Busselskabet Movia. Kampagnen er MEGET tilfreds med al denne omtale, som eller ikke kan købes for penge, og har fået overvældende tilslutning som følge af begivenhederne. Det drejer sig om ytringsfrihed og således om at få reklamerne tilbage på de københavnske busser, hvor de hører til i overensstemmelse med den oprindelige aftale med Movia.



----------------------------------------------------

Our response is to intensify the campaign

These funds will pay for a more powerful and this time a tremendous nationwide campaign-boost, including other media than busses. Through this campaign you can be part of making this happen.

Vores svar er at intensivere kampagnen yderligere

Denne indsamling skal finansiere et langt kraftigere og denne gang landsdækkende kampagnefremstød, hvor forskellige reklamemedier vil blive taget i brug. Du kan via denne crowdfunding være med til at støtte, at dette bliver til virkelighed.

<div>Alexandra DiFlorio and I (Michael Zbikowski) are two ambitious students who are looking to influence and change the world using our passion of music and art. Our love for the arts has inspired us to pursue our goals to educate individuals about political and social issues that are prevalent in our society. We hope to create an educated and respectable community through these arts to reach out to people and encourage the possibility for positive change. On May 15th, 2015 we are looking to enlighten people about mental illness, and alleviate any stigma associated with it by running a showcase featuring musicians and artists from Toronto and having a positive and open conversation on the topic. We strongly feel that mental health is of a huge importance, and we want to start making the right changes in order for it to be a more understood, supported and open issue.  This event has already been approved by <a href=""http://www.camh.ca/en/hospital/Pages/home.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CAMH (Center for Addiction and Mental Health)</a>, and if our goal is reached, 100% of the proceeds made from ticket sales will be donated to CAMH. Any contribution will help us create a large scale community that reaches beyond the peripheries of Toronto, and to realize our dream of making the world a better place one event at a time.</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need $500 to help us realize our vision! Here is what YOUR contributions will do:</p>

<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The biggest risk for us would be to spend our own non-existent money to make this event as successful as possible.

<p>However, we are both ready to embrace the financial burden ourselves, and contribute as much as we can from our own pockets to make our event, not only fun, but educational and have a lasting impact. </p>
<p>We are saving money from the part-time jobs we both work (that only pays minimum wage), and we are looking for the help from our parents and friends who can contribute in any manner, whether its through sharing our event through social media, or help us run the event smoothly.

</div> <div style=""text-align: justify;""> <p>SeeBox can unlock your child's future in engineering. The child is engaged by watching short animated videos, then does experiments on real playboards, and

<p>Did  you know that Electronic- and Electrical (EE) Engineers are on the list  of high demand occupations in many countries around the world?</p>
<p>I've been an electronic engineer for 18 years and designed dozens of 
new products spanning many industries.  I saw how often the great 
engineers got exposure to engineering when they were young, learning by being curious.  So together
 with a team of engineers I set out to invent a device that will enable 
all schools and every parent at home to create the next generation of EE
 engineers.</p>

The Impact

We  believe that schools are still developing learners for jobs that will be 
replaced by technology in the near future, and at the same time failing 
to stimulate learners to become much needed engineers and scientists.  
This is especially true in Africa, where the focus is 
often on manufacturing to create jobs. This is temporary at best, because eventually automation, driven by 
Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, will make those jobs obsolete.
With SeeBox a child who has never been introduced to EE 
engineering can seamlessly cross that barrier of the unknown and the 
intimidating, and start thinking analytically, like an engineer - all while having fun playing a game.

</div></div>","Short Summary 
At first we thought small:  a sculpture that could embody the purpose of the Geller Center.  But then we thought, wait!  There are millions of people around the world who long for peace.  Can we create a  work of art that brings all these people together?  Combine our intentions - our longings - into an expression that tangibly radiates the energy of PEACE!  
Yes! what about a worldwide art and book project, filled with messages of peace by the people of the world for the people of the world!  What if we invite a multitude of hopes and blessings to be placed in a time capsule in an international award-winning sculpture of PEACE!  and create a book that shares the project with the world?! 
So...  we invite you to join us as we create PEACE!   Be part of a time capsule to be placed inside the sculpture;  be published in a book where your insights, your inspiration, for the world will be heard. 
In the heart of Fort Collins, Colorado, is a special place
that has always been about seeking the greater good - nurturing healthy
individuals, a vibrant community, and a peaceful world.  (For over 50 years the Geller Center has put on thousands of programs that live out this mission and been the genesis of many crucial non-profit organizations in the community:  the Downtown Food Bank, the Women’s Crisis Center, the International Center, and the Center
for Peace and Justice, to name just a few.) We have been guided by an
understanding that peace grows from the ground up and from the inside out.

Now the Geller Center and Dream Big Sculpture team up in a powerful new project,  this time engaging people from
all over the world.  Lorri Acott’s  12-foot award-winning sculpture, Peace, is the centerpiece for the project,  and offers a powerful and unique opportunity to proclaim your hopes and best wishes for the world.  With your participation and thousands of others, we can create a masterpeace that helps move our planet in a healing direction!
  
                 What We Need & What You Get In addition to participation from all over the world, we are reaching for $15,000 to add to our local fundraising efforts to pay for the ""centerpeace"" of this project, the award winning bronze sculpture Peace.  The money that is raised above the cost of the sculpture will be used to produce the book, and to fund more wonderful projects at the Geller Center - perhaps even the new facility!  (visit the Geller Center website for more info:  www.gellercenter.org)
Your participation can earn you:   


A place in the book and your folded origami crane with your message to the world in the time capsule and opportunities to provide that for others. Here is a you tube link to folding an origami crane as well as a link to a pdf that can be printed.



A hand folded cast bronze bronze paper crane. You can fold it yourself if you'd like, or Lorri will do it for you.

A 25""  bronze Peace  that can be acquired in three different ways: Donation (see ""Perks"");  Essay Contest;  or by using your indiegogo share tools to spread the word about the campaign.




5'4"" ""Arc of Peace"" sculpture by Lorri Acott

                                                 The Impact


      Where we focus our attention      becomes the direction we move.  
It is a known truth that when we focus on the positive in the world, we actually bring more positive energy to it. When we focus on peace, we literally create peace.  When we focus on hope, we bring hope.  And when we join together in this creative process, the result is an exponential multiplication of positive energy with world-wide impact.
Remember Anne Frank?  Her powerful words of peace were heard because her words were published.  Just think how powerful it will be to read notes of peace, insight, and inspiration from all over the world!
                          
                            Risks & Challenges
 Our plan is to install the permanent bronze sculpture, Peace, along with the time capsule on September 12th (not only is this the date of the Geller Center's Xaniscape festival, but it also honors the anniversary of 9/11).  Our hope is to fill the time capsule with over a thousand folded origami paper cranes that will hold insights, inspirations and hopes for the world.  ( If we don't have a thousand cranes by installation time, we will hold all the cranes and information for the book until we do, but with your help, we know we can do this!)  
Once the sculpture is installed, we will create the book that contains our messages of peace by the people of the world for the people of the world.  If some unforeseen circumstance should delay the installation in September, all  perks will still be delivered.  Please note:  sculpture perks may take 3-6 months to deliver.    
                        Other Ways You Can Help Some people can't contribute financially but can still help (and you might even win a special prize)!  Use the Indiegogo share tools to spread the word about the campaign.  Email and talk to friends - and other people or groups - that might want to participate.
Help us engage international participation!
There will be special perks for people who raise money for the project  (even if they have no ability to donate themselves).  Most notably, you can receive one of two bronze sculptures for FREE.   Just use the indiegogo share tools to spread the word, and we'll be able to track the donations that come from your email. Raise $5,000 and get a bronze hand folded origami crane. Raise $10,000 in donations and get a 25"" limited Bronze edition of the Peace sculpture!

<li>Donors to the Busoola School Campaign will receive gifts ranging from a shout out on our social media sites to a name on the building.</li> <li>The funds will go into an account designated for the school construction if we don't reach our goal</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Change a Child's Life</h3> <p>Busoola Village has a population of about 1000 households.  The level of poverty is higher than average. Most farming is done with a hand hoe, although an occasional oxen plough can be seen. Cultivation by tractor is very rare. The principle crops are maize, cassava, Irish potatoes, native potatoes, beans and rice. Incomes are supplemented by growing coffee for export.</p>

The school project is a passion of Project Lydia's founders, Cliff and Julie Pash. They have lived and worked in remote villages in Uganda for 8 years as founders of Advancing The Kingdom. Project Lydia is a successful creator of jobs for women. Now Project Lydia wants to provide a school for children.


Existing schools are far (1-2 miles in distance)
The facilities available are of a poor quality
Poor educational opportunities cause family fractures
Too many children do not attend school.
Poor education leads to delinquent behaviors
English and/or Swahili are needed for inter-regional mobility and work opportunities, yet, language skills are very poor.
Lack of education causes people to join rebel extremist & radical groups:
These radical/extremist groups are currently recruiting in Busoola.

With your gift, you will launch a child from poverty to possibility with an education.   What We Need & What You Get Here's what we need to launch construction of the school:

We need $30,000 to start building the foundation of the school. We need a total of $130,000 to complete the school but since this is our first campaign, we wanted to aim for $30,000.
Donors to the Busoola School Campaign will receive gifts ranging from a shout out on our social media sites to a name on the building. The funds will go into an account designated for the school construction if we don't reach our goal    Change a Child's Life Busoola Village has a population of about 1000 households.  The level of poverty is higher than average. Most farming is done with a hand hoe, although an occasional oxen plough can be seen. Cultivation by tractor is very rare. The principle crops are maize, cassava, Irish potatoes, native potatoes, beans and rice. Incomes are supplemented by growing coffee for export.
By investing in a school, you're empowering children to be set free from poverty. Project Lydia has a successful record of empowering women with economic opportunity. More than 60 women are earning incomes. Four of the women have built new houses this year, and many more have improved their housing by adding new roofs. The women have increased their gardening space to grow more food and added goats, cows, and chickens to their small farms. I’m told even their families are healthier because they eat better and can afford medical care. As the Project Lydia women spend their incomes within their villages, others have started new businesses which is helping the community at large to prosper. As we travel down the dirt road from village to village there are so many shiny new roofs and houses being built as a result of the impact Project Lydia women have made. 
60 women working with Project Lydia are able to send 200 children to school.

<h3>Peace and Love Friends...</h3> <p>Skai here along with an amazing group of people who are interested and ready to get this farm really moving! We represent the Luquillo Farm Sanctuary...a program of Muevete Puerto Rico Inc....the only ecological educational farm of its kind on the island. We have been working this 80 acre farm on funds in pocket and its time that we take this project and push it out into the atmosphere. Our goals this year is to get more tools, develop our Permaculture curriculum, establish a cash crop to keep the farm sustainable and start our main programs Campo Boriken. and Mi Escuela Natural which afford students opportunities to learn about growing food, the importance of this task, how fun it can be, and most importantly its relationship with our health.</p>

We have applied for several big and small grants to no avail which is why we are implementing this campaign through Indiegogo.  At this time we are working on raising $10,000.  This will help us get more tools...better tools, establish the cash crop...we are going with Mint...because Mint is a major ingredient in Mojitos used by the more than 18,000 restaurants on the island. This will help us fund the farm for our projects, staffing, and growth. Mint grows fast, and spreads. Not to mention Iguanas which are all over the place dont eat mint.  YAY!</p>

<p>We also want to set up better facilities for our volunteers. Last year we hosted more than 30 people from around the world. They actually camped out on the farm without running water or electricity. We fed them 3 square a day and they were able to enjoy the Puerto Rican beaches and rainforests too. We have recently added running water to the farm...now we need fully functioning bathrooms and a kitchen would be ideal so that we can make the actual meals on the farm. This will also enable us to host events on the farm like Jazz Nights, etc which also would be a great fundraiser for the farm.</p>

<p>Eating is an agricultural act. ~Wendell Berry</p>
<p>When we look at a plate of food, we don't think about the thousands of miles it probably traveled to reach us. We don't think about the energy (oftentimes fossil fuels emitting greenhouse gases) consumed in its transportation, or in its harvesting, processing, refrigeration, and packaging. We dont think about the chemicals and carcinogenic pesticides sprayed on the fields where our food was grown, nor do we think about all the people and jobs involved from start to finish.Though it may not be obvious to the majority of human beings,eating a banana produced by the current corporate agricultural means may contribute to global warming and the exploitation of the working class in Guatemala. In this rapidly dynamic world, it is of ultimate importance to think about the web of food production.</p>

There are relatively few risks here. I will not be spending your money up front, so in the very unlikely circumstances that I am unable to complete the course, I will refund everyone.
I also promise to refund anyone if they do not think the course is fully awesome.",2.0,0,"2 Campaigns

And all of that <i>regardless of the children's family's ability to pay.</i></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Almas Shriners volunteer their own time, money, and resources to drive children in need of medical treatment from the Washington DC Metropolitan Area all the way to the Shriners Hospitals for Children in Philadelphia. Every month, I hop in my car, pick up a child and their family, and drive six hours round-trip to make sure they get the care they need without having worry about how they will get to the hospital. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I love what I do, but the cost adds up very quickly. Between gas, tolls, food, and car maintenence, it costs a Shriner volunteer at least $100 out of pocket to pay a child's way.</span></p>

<p><b>Current Situation:</b></p>
<p>Before the earthquakes and aftershocks of spring/summer 2015, the village of Suri in Dolakha had a primary elementary school providing education for one hundred children. Virtually all of the school was destroyed in late April and early May’s quakes, and the rest rendered unusable.</p>
<p>Currently, five teachers have been conducting class in a temporarily constructed windowless wooden shelter without a kitchen, indoor lavatories, and administrative offices to which they are accustomed.

<p> </p>
<p><b>Fundraising Goal: </b></p>
<p>If we want to help build a brighter, stronger future for Nepal, children’s education is the most effective and efficient means of helping.  A rough, preliminary estimate<br/>for the reconstruction of the school has been given at about $12,000 (USD).  Additional, funds will be used to reconstruct a public school serving the poor in the historical town of Bhaktapur.</p>
<p>We plan to fundraise through August 2015.  With monsoon season on the horizon and a temporary government prohibition on construction, we anticipate construction of the new facility to begin in early autumn.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Oversight:</b></p>
<p>To avoid misappropriation of funds, two committees will be created.  A committee consisting of seven local members will manage the design and construction process on the ground.  A second supervisory committee consisting of seven regional members will function to review expenditures, oversee the construction process, and phasically disperse funds when goals of each stage are met.  The funds will be released in a step-wise manner to insure appropriate and effective use. We expect the construction of the school to be completed within 3 months of<br/>groundbreaking.<br/></p>

</div><p><em>The Global Initiative for the Youth of Haiti will
provide benefits for recent high school graduates of Haiti, who would otherwise
be unable to further their education due to the lack of finances, resource and

</div><p><em><b>Our
program promotes Haitians giving back to Haitians</b>. </em></p><div>
</div><p><em>A pre-requisite of the program will be an
agreed amount of time spent working in Haiti, following graduation. This will
enable the students to give back to their local communities and benefit the
growth and progression of Haiti.</em></p><div>

</div></div>","We are The Global Initiative for the Youth of
Haiti – and our primary goal is to provide Haitian students with access to
further education. 
We believe that in order for Haiti to move
forward and compete on a global scale we must educate the next generation of
Haitian Youth
We are committed to facilitating university programs
both in Haiti and overseas, providing the youth of Haiti with further
education, a global perspective and life skills. 

Our vision is to provide further education to
the local Haitian high school students, enabling Haiti to raise a generation of
professionals, innovators and leaders. 



Education
is the key to unlock the golden door of freedom.
-
George Washington Carver - 









How The Program
Works


The Global Initiative for the Youth of Haiti will
provide benefits for recent high school graduates of Haiti, who would otherwise
be unable to further their education due to the lack of finances, resource and
family support. There is also limited capacity within existing Haitian colleges
and universities, making the competition extremely high and outcomes low. 
Our
program promotes Haitians giving back to Haitians. 
A pre-requisite of the program will be an
agreed amount of time spent working in Haiti, following graduation. This will
enable the students to give back to their local communities and benefit the
growth and progression of Haiti.
We want to make a student's dream of getting a
full education a reality.
At the Global Initiative for the Youth of Haiti
we promote education because it is every student’s right to gain knowledge, to
think, to create and to have equal in the world. 



An investment in knowledge pays the best interest.
-
Benjamin Franklin - 









How The Global Initiative for the
Youth of Haiti works



The Global Initiative
for the Youth of Haiti is a non-profit and we rely on the kindness, donations
and contributions of people just like you. 
With your support we
can change thousand’s of lives and the fate of a nation. 

We know how important
it is for every nation to stand on its own and be an active contributor to the
world. This is the dream of millions of Haitians, and through our program we
will provide further education for thousands of young students who can make
this a reality for Haiti. 
  





With your support and
contributions we will deliver our programmes of support, education and resource
to the Youth of Haiti. 












The
direction in which education starts a man will determine his future in life.

WHY WE ARE
CROWDFUNDING



Our hope is that
through this crowdfunding campaign we will impact the lives of many Haitian
youth, providing hope and encouragement for thousands.

By crowdfunding we
can touch the lives of many in a positive way, and we hope to connect with
fellow students, educators and those with compassion for others through this
campaign. 
We know that by
spreading our message to all of you who believe in the power of education we
can fund this program and provide a sustainable further education program for
many generations to come. 

So please join us and
do whatever you can to support our campaign. Every thing you can do to help us
is greatly appreciated. Contributions, donations, sharing the message on social
media, it all helps and with your help we will change the future of a nation.



Encouragement

future.

Why You Should Support the Global
Initiative for the Youth of Haiti


We have one goal! 
Our goal is to make

get back on their feet and become a self-sufficient nation of the future.  

As the saying goes, “if
you give a man a fish he will eat for a day – if you teach a man to fish he will

Many of us have
changed our own lives through a good education, strong support system and the
necessary resource to make our futures secure and our dreams a reality.

We can acquire better music gear, art supplies and yoga equipment.  With this level of help we can offer more frequent community-priced (sliding scale, donation, or $10 or under) classes and activities every week right from the beginning.</p><p><strong>Stretch Goal 2: $35,000</strong> Reaching this goal will help with all of the above, plus enabling us to offer consistent community priced classes, as well as scholarships for workshops and classes.</p><p><strong>Stretch Goal 3: $50,000</strong> Reaching this goal will help FAM take care of everything listed above, deck the space out with technology and gear for all kinds of art events, and begin to offer free after school yoga and art classes to local students aged 12-18.</p><p><strong>Stretch Goal 4: $60,000</strong> Will help with ALL of the above, and will kickstart projects for the building like sprinklers and an elevator or stair lift to increase safety and capacity.  Other projects envisioned include acquiring a FAMily urban farm from which we can host urban homesteading and cooking classes.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><div>

Molly has worked and volunteered in yoga studios and with KarmaFest, teaching yoga and facilitating events and retreats since 2009.Photo by Philip Edward Laubner Welcome to our FAMily...Firehouse Arts & Music, or F.A.M., is a multi-disciplinary art and learning center opening in Baltimore, MD, in September 2016. F.A.M. is located in the Bromo Arts District.  Contributors to this campaign will help us provide a unique space in Baltimore City for learning, fun, and artistic expression! In the midst of tension and fear we’re experiencing worldwide and as a city, coming together to find common ground is more important than ever. Creating together creates community, and we want to be a place for that to thrive.Daveed Korup is an arts-integration specialist who will be teaching percussion classes for Kids (KIDS DRUM) and adults (Tao Te Drum Curriculum). More about Daveed Korup Our MissionTo provide fun, affordable classes, workshops and events taught by professional artists and instructors of all mediums and disciplines in the Baltimore Area. F.A.M.'s classes target the whole person: body, mind, spirit. By offering yoga and meditation classes to compliment classes in the arts and music, we hope to help our community express creatively while practicing self-care and expansion of consciousness. Many artists in our community are already practitioners of some kind of meditation, and find that this supports their emotional balance and creative process. FAM would like to foster both!F.A.M. is both a community of artists and instructors whose philosophy is teamwork and interdependence (encourage one another, help each other out, pay it forward!) and a safe, urban space for being creative, whatever the art or practice may be.  We are not a yoga studio, art studio, band practice space, healing space, art gallery, music venue or art studio- strictly-- as a flex space, we’re all of the above! Our Monetary Goals: Initial Goal: $25,000 - Reaching this goal will help with startup costs like: furnishings, software and technology, modular stages, insurance, rent, and utilities. With this help we can hit the ground running with weekly yoga/dance and other community-priced classes and book workshops and special events immediately.Stretch Goal 1: $30,000 will help with start up costs even more! We can acquire better music gear, art supplies and yoga equipment.  With this level of help we can offer more frequent community-priced (sliding scale, donation, or $10 or under) classes and activities every week right from the beginning.Stretch Goal 2: $35,000 Reaching this goal will help with all of the above, plus enabling us to offer consistent community priced classes, as well as scholarships for workshops and classes.Stretch Goal 3: $50,000 Reaching this goal will help FAM take care of everything listed above, deck the space out with technology and gear for all kinds of art events, and begin to offer free after school yoga and art classes to local students aged 12-18.Stretch Goal 4: $60,000 Will help with ALL of the above, and will kickstart projects for the building like sprinklers and an elevator or stair lift to increase safety and capacity.  Other projects envisioned include acquiring a FAMily urban farm from which we can host urban homesteading and cooking classes. 
F.A.M. will offer a weekly schedule of drop-in classes in:


Kundalini, Vinyasa, & Hatha Yoga 
Ballet, modern, hip-hop, and fusion dance classes for kids and adults
Select Martial Arts like Jiu Jitsu, Tai Chi Standing Meditation, and Kung Fu
Mindfulness Meditation
Percussion classes for Kids and Adults

<p>About four of us started this project in the
summer of 2015, we now have an engineering team in both California and China.
We developed the framework of what we called Smart Recognition and Prediction
data engine on cloud side. Then we decided to design our own consumer-side
devices to, first, personalize our concept of ubiquitous smartness, bring joys
of the experience to consumers, and second, to ensure the data of integrity
feeding our server, so we will have real ""big data"". We did it with angel
funding, and completed prototypes of two devices and the back-end server. Our
team is now ready for the next step, turn prototypes into final products and
services. </p>
<p><b>What Are The Products &amp; Use Cases?</b></p>
<p>There are initially three devices, uBOT
(personal robot), uSEE (smart screen) and uKNOW (sensor). They interact with
one another. Two of them will interact with users, and will communicate with
our cloud server, the Smart Engine. </p>
<p><b><i>Use Case 1</i></b></p>
<p>In a typical weekday morning, I go down
to my dining room. I sit down and prepare to eat, and then uBOT,
sitting on the kitchen counter, turns over to me. Right after
uBOT greets me, uSEE stops what it is displaying of black and
white, Manhattan street view (my favorite photos), and start showing date,
time, city name (where I live), and weather condition, Five seconds later, the
screen switches to show headline news (the types of what I care). Five seconds
later, it switches again to show my calendar (today I have 2 meetings at
10am and 2:30pm each, and it's the deadline for my project first draft). In
another five seconds, the screen switches to show traffic condition of my
normal route driving to work (the heavy traffic part). Last, a screen
shows my ""Today's health index"", 8 on the scale
of 10 (10 being the best). Then the screen resumes its ""digital photo
frame"", showing my favorite photos which rotate every 10 seconds. Note
that the whole process I have no manual operation of any sort. AND, the photos
on uSEE's screen are all my personal favorite pictures, stored at uSEE.</p>
<p>My son Ethan comes to dining table now. uBOT
greets Ethan, and then uSEE starts to show his favorite game. He's
at Pokemon level 12, then reminds him of his social-study home work
submission. </p>
<p>The above repeats when my wife Kathy shows up,
as to showing her route to work traffic, her calendar, and her health
index. </p>
<p><b><i>Use Case 2</i></b></p>
<p>One minute after everyone
has left home, uBOT enters ""surveillance mode"". Under
this mode, uBOT's ""head"" (upper body) will rotate 360° in every 1
minute slot at low rotating speed. </p>
<p>Imagine that front door (or one of
windows) is suddenly opened. If uBOT can directly sees the door, it
immediately turns over its front HD camera toward the door, captures the
person, and triggers ""alert mode"". If uBOT can't directly see the
door, but a uSEE can, the system triggers ""alert mode"", too. uBOT and
uSEE (herein refer to as the system) will then do two things: 1) in real time,
family members' phones will receive a courtesy message, informing the door was
opened. 2) The system waits to identify the person(s) who enters the door (such
identification will depend on the number of factors to complete. If
interested, we can discuss offline). If identified as a member of the family,
for instance, Ethan comes home from school, alert is dismissed. If identified
as a ""stranger"", a second message is sent to family members'
phones immediately. </p>
<p>Every family member will receive an alert or a
dismiss message (the second message). Members can touch a link contained in the
message, then access uBOT's camera and watch the situation remotely. In the
message there is police number to call with a single touch. Family members'
phone numbers are also showing in the message, calling son or daughter
telling them not to go home at this moment, with a single touch. </p>
<p>As a service the system can also allow family
members to access video taken by uBOT and/or uSEE afterwards, which is stored
at server, as a fee-based service (optional). As far as the service is not
subscribed, there is no fee of any sort charged to users. </p>
<p><b><i>Use Case 3</i></b></p>
<p>When you're talking in a video call
(limited to two parties), and you move to the position that is within the
distance of 6.5 Ft. (2 meters, tentatively) from a uSEE unit (let's
call it DDU 1, digital display unit 1), in the front position, your phone will
begin to mirror its screen to DDU 1 (with a pop-up button for you to touch, if
you press it you give permission for the mirroring). With a single touch,

<p><b>Our Mission</b></p>
<p>The concepts like cloud, big data, machine
learning is all abstract. We have found our way to bring the smartness directly
to consumers, and help everyone raise awareness of his or her well being and
that of their love ones. Our devices are Personal Robots. Once you have them in
home, over the time you will build a personal relationship with them like
another brother or sister. And, the intelligence should definitely not be
contained by a single box. It must be everywhere, anytime, when one wants it.
With the achievement we have got thus far, we are confident that we will make
the dream come true. So, help us by contributing to this project. You will not

<br/></div>","Who Are We?
About four of us started this project in the
summer of 2015, we now have an engineering team in both California and China.
We developed the framework of what we called Smart Recognition and Prediction
data engine on cloud side. Then we decided to design our own consumer-side
devices to, first, personalize our concept of ubiquitous smartness, bring joys
of the experience to consumers, and second, to ensure the data of integrity
feeding our server, so we will have real ""big data"". We did it with angel
funding, and completed prototypes of two devices and the back-end server. Our
team is now ready for the next step, turn prototypes into final products and
services. 
What Are The Products & Use Cases?
There are initially three devices, uBOT
(personal robot), uSEE (smart screen) and uKNOW (sensor). They interact with
one another. Two of them will interact with users, and will communicate with
our cloud server, the Smart Engine. 
Use Case 1
In a typical weekday morning, I go down
to my dining room. I sit down and prepare to eat, and then uBOT,
sitting on the kitchen counter, turns over to me. Right after
uBOT greets me, uSEE stops what it is displaying of black and
white, Manhattan street view (my favorite photos), and start showing date,
time, city name (where I live), and weather condition, Five seconds later, the
screen switches to show headline news (the types of what I care). Five seconds
later, it switches again to show my calendar (today I have 2 meetings at
10am and 2:30pm each, and it's the deadline for my project first draft). In
another five seconds, the screen switches to show traffic condition of my
normal route driving to work (the heavy traffic part). Last, a screen
shows my ""Today's health index"", 8 on the scale
of 10 (10 being the best). Then the screen resumes its ""digital photo
frame"", showing my favorite photos which rotate every 10 seconds. Note
that the whole process I have no manual operation of any sort. AND, the photos
on uSEE's screen are all my personal favorite pictures, stored at uSEE.
My son Ethan comes to dining table now. uBOT
greets Ethan, and then uSEE starts to show his favorite game. He's
at Pokemon level 12, then reminds him of his social-study home work
submission. 
The above repeats when my wife Kathy shows up,
as to showing her route to work traffic, her calendar, and her health
index. 
Use Case 2
One minute after everyone
has left home, uBOT enters ""surveillance mode"". Under
this mode, uBOT's ""head"" (upper body) will rotate 360° in every 1
minute slot at low rotating speed. 
Imagine that front door (or one of
windows) is suddenly opened. If uBOT can directly sees the door, it
immediately turns over its front HD camera toward the door, captures the
person, and triggers ""alert mode"". If uBOT can't directly see the
door, but a uSEE can, the system triggers ""alert mode"", too. uBOT and
uSEE (herein refer to as the system) will then do two things: 1) in real time,
family members' phones will receive a courtesy message, informing the door was
opened. 2) The system waits to identify the person(s) who enters the door (such
identification will depend on the number of factors to complete. If
interested, we can discuss offline). If identified as a member of the family,
for instance, Ethan comes home from school, alert is dismissed. If identified
as a ""stranger"", a second message is sent to family members'
phones immediately. 
Every family member will receive an alert or a
dismiss message (the second message). Members can touch a link contained in the
message, then access uBOT's camera and watch the situation remotely. In the
message there is police number to call with a single touch. Family members'
phone numbers are also showing in the message, calling son or daughter
telling them not to go home at this moment, with a single touch. 
As a service the system can also allow family
members to access video taken by uBOT and/or uSEE afterwards, which is stored
at server, as a fee-based service (optional). As far as the service is not
subscribed, there is no fee of any sort charged to users. 
Use Case 3
When you're talking in a video call
(limited to two parties), and you move to the position that is within the
distance of 6.5 Ft. (2 meters, tentatively) from a uSEE unit (let's
call it DDU 1, digital display unit 1), in the front position, your phone will
begin to mirror its screen to DDU 1 (with a pop-up button for you to touch, if
you press it you give permission for the mirroring). With a single touch,
mirroring starts. At that point you will talk to the uSEE screen and can put
your phone into your packet. Then you leave DDU 1, and get close to DDU
2. DDU 1 stops mirroring and DDU 2 takes over mirroring (2nd DDU will not
ask for permission). At this point, you are continuing talking to DDU2. This
feature gives convenience to users to be able to move around doing chores or
looking for something, while talking on the video call without being
interrupted. 
The same procedure will take place when you
are watching a movie on your Smart phone and start walking around. You simply
walk to any uSEE DDU and continue watching the movie. 
On a side explanation, when you are not using
your Smart phone, there is no Mirroring or Mirroring Transfer triggered. uSEE
DDUs are just like digital photo frames, and rotate to display the photos
stored in the uSEE. However, they are ""Smart"" digital frames. After
the machines work in your home for a few days, uSEEs (in fact the system
including uBOT and server) will learn what's your taste of a picture. So
when you are nearby a uSEE DDU, it will show pictures of your type. When your son
or daughter is nearby, uSEE screen will shift to show pictures of his type.
Yes, you will need to store pictures in all uSEE units. 
Remember that uSEE and uBOT are both powerful
robots, except that uSEE can't move. When a uSEE sees someone, the whole system
at home, including uBOT and other uSEEs, all see you. In other words, any of
the uBOT or uSEE at home identifies a stranger, they will not perform Mirroring
and Mirroring Transfer. Rather they will do nothing when there are family
members at home, or trigger an alarm message if the system is at
""surveillance mode"", as described in previous use cases. 
More Use Cases
uBOT and uSEE are an open platform from
hardware standpoint. By offering what are described in the use case 1, 2 and 3,
it does not limit what it can do from a long term. Users can download more apps
from Unseen Motion website or app stores, then uBOT and uSEE can do more

<h2>Background of Laos</h2>
<p></p>
<div>
<p></p>
<p>The Lao People’s Democratic Republic is one of the least developed nations in the world. It is very mountainous and has no direct access to any seaports. Most of the country is still inaccessible by road or roads can be severely damaged by natural disasters like mudslides or flooding. To make matters worse, much of the country faces problems with food security. Rural highland communities and ethnic villages face even much higher rates of food insecurity than the rest of Laos. “One in two children five years of age and below face stunted growth or is chronically malnourished. Ethnic highland communities living in remote areas and rural children are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity and malnourishment”.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471366057/12512808_540859869409564_4986300887244031758_n_zf5mwx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p></p>
<h2>Khmu Culture</h2>
<p>Ethnic villagers rely heavily upon the highland forests to perform shifting cultivation. Growing rice and other crops is such an essential portion of their culture that they even have prescribed gender roles related to agriculture. Khmu (ethnic tribe) women decide what kinds of rice to plant and Khmu men decide what land to plant the rice upon. They love their land and respect the forest greatly as it is their main source of income, clothing, and food. Khmu people themselves say “without rice, the Khmu die”. Before planting rice and other crops, the Khmu perform traditional rituals asking permission from the nature spirits to lend the land to them and vowing to return the land back to the spirits upon completion of the harvest. They ask the spirits: “Please give us a good crop of rice, may we have enough to eat our fill”.</p>

<br/><p></p>
<h2><b>Challenges with Shifting Cultivation</b></h2>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Traditionally,
the method of  shifting cultivation was quite successful for the Khmu
people. However, now they have much larger populations and foraging in the
forest for food has lead to a critical loss of biodiversity that is not
sustainable and it is no longer eco-friendly. They must use young forests to
produce food at the rate that they are consuming it. Young forests are
susceptible to increased weed cultivation and thus the locals must use
herbicides to kill off the unwanted weeds.</span></p>

<p>Our eco-toilet model designed by SuDHiCA has been built with all natural materials locally sourced from the NATEC project, it is designed to work with the surrounding ecosystem and it is much less maintenance than a traditional toilet. This eco-toilet model will serve as a great example for villagers who can not afford expensive materials to build their own toilets (most of the rural highland people don't have toilets and have poor hygiene). This sample model will show them alternative options to building a toilet, it is not expensive and it works like a traditional toilet.</p>

<p>We have finished building a demonstration of eco-friendly soil management at the NATEC project, we focus to educate people on what soil is and how vital it is for our crops.

<p>Sengla and Buachan  are our role model family for the NATEC project who focus on fruit and herb ecological farming. They started to work and get support from us since March of this year, they are just like other rural families living in the rural highlands of Laos that hope to earn more income to improve their living conditions. By starting their own agribusiness, it ensures food security to help build a better future for their children and create stable employment in their homeland. They expect to get their first big sale of their produce in November of this year!</p>

Some of the NATEC's family members can grow their own vegetables to supply their kitchens and increase the nutrition of the meals which they feed to their  children. Now, they do not need to forage through the forest for hours to collect their food.<br/>

Background of Laos



The Lao People’s Democratic Republic is one of the least developed nations in the world. It is very mountainous and has no direct access to any seaports. Most of the country is still inaccessible by road or roads can be severely damaged by natural disasters like mudslides or flooding. To make matters worse, much of the country faces problems with food security. Rural highland communities and ethnic villages face even much higher rates of food insecurity than the rest of Laos. “One in two children five years of age and below face stunted growth or is chronically malnourished. Ethnic highland communities living in remote areas and rural children are particularly vulnerable to food insecurity and malnourishment”.




Khmu Culture
Ethnic villagers rely heavily upon the highland forests to perform shifting cultivation. Growing rice and other crops is such an essential portion of their culture that they even have prescribed gender roles related to agriculture. Khmu (ethnic tribe) women decide what kinds of rice to plant and Khmu men decide what land to plant the rice upon. They love their land and respect the forest greatly as it is their main source of income, clothing, and food. Khmu people themselves say “without rice, the Khmu die”. Before planting rice and other crops, the Khmu perform traditional rituals asking permission from the nature spirits to lend the land to them and vowing to return the land back to the spirits upon completion of the harvest. They ask the spirits: “Please give us a good crop of rice, may we have enough to eat our fill”.



Challenges with Shifting Cultivation
Traditionally,
the method of  shifting cultivation was quite successful for the Khmu
people. However, now they have much larger populations and foraging in the
forest for food has lead to a critical loss of biodiversity that is not
sustainable and it is no longer eco-friendly. They must use young forests to
produce food at the rate that they are consuming it. Young forests are
susceptible to increased weed cultivation and thus the locals must use
herbicides to kill off the unwanted weeds.



How can you help?
We
are asking for your help here at SuDHiCA because in order to make the NATEC
project fully functional, we need to build an agro-ecological demonstration and
research center. This will serve as the location where we will provide
workshops to teach our farmers how to set up their own agribusiness plan to
provide food security to their communities and to generate income for
impoverished families.
Your
contribution will go towards increasing the skills of young Khmu farmers in
agroecological practices, developing individualized agribusiness plans with
farmers who join the NATEC project, and creating a source of revenue for
farming families to help kick-start their own agribusiness plan.





Your Impact
The
contribution that you make will create a tangible difference in this community.
By donating to the NATEC project, you are helping to eradicate poverty and
malnourishment in the highland communities of Laos. Furthermore, your money is
going towards creating a community that cares about their environment around
them and farming in a way that is sustainable and doesn't destroy the precious
biodiversity of Laos.



Making a Change
SuDHiCA and the NATEC project (Namsing
Agroecological Tranining and Education Center) strive to provide comprehensive
environmental education and hands-on practice in the field of agroecology so
that rural farmers and their families can create an individualized action plan
with us that is sustainable and environmentally friendly for their communities.
Upon completion of the workshop training with the NATEC project, rural farmers
will be able to create a source of economic income for their families in a way
that is environmentally conscious and sustainable for the forests and upland
rice fields that are so important and precious to their culture.




Preserve Khmu Culture

Collectively, our organization exists to cooperate with the ethnic villagers in a way that preserves their civilization and customs, but also wishes to provide a successful model of environmentally friendly agriculture so that these communities can take control of their livelihoods and decide their own future.


Our Perks
We would love to give every single donor a handicraft made from natural materials locally sourced from Laos highlands. However, it is quite expensive to do any sort of international shipping from Laos. We welcome you to visit our NATEC project upon completion if you ever decide to come to Laos.  We appreciate every donation and your name will be included in a list of donors who helped made the NATEC project become possible to serve the Khmu communities.

Our milestones:


Uncle Khamsao is one of the NATEC project members who is very interested to start his own ecological agribusiness and hope to increase his family's income so that they can have adequate food for family meals and provide financial support for his children to obtain a higher education. He is pictured here practicing new ideas in the project field after he has learned from several workshops with us about ecological vegetable growing by Hugelkultur technique, varieties selection, smart-climate agriculture, natural pest and weed management, plant nutrition, and soil management. We teach them to always care about environmental sustainability; it is the heart of our teaching.  

Khmu children enjoying an environmental awareness activity!

Our eco-toilet model designed by SuDHiCA has been built with all natural materials locally sourced from the NATEC project, it is designed to work with the surrounding ecosystem and it is much less maintenance than a traditional toilet. This eco-toilet model will serve as a great example for villagers who can not afford expensive materials to build their own toilets (most of the rural highland people don't have toilets and have poor hygiene). This sample model will show them alternative options to building a toilet, it is not expensive and it works like a traditional toilet.

We have finished building a demonstration of eco-friendly soil management at the NATEC project, we focus to educate people on what soil is and how vital it is for our crops. At NATEC, we always tell our farmers that 'healthy soil gives you healthy food'. Furthermore, we increase  our farmer's knowledge about the connection between ecology and agriculture.

Vanxai (SuDHiCA's agricultural technical staff) and uncle Bounnoi (SuDHiCA's field staff) are doing research and an experiment on a seed bomb technique that will help farmers to acquire new skills and serve as a good alternative option to seeding with much less work. 

Sengla and Buachan  are our role model family for the NATEC project who focus on fruit and herb ecological farming. They started to work and get support from us since March of this year, they are just like other rural families living in the rural highlands of Laos that hope to earn more income to improve their living conditions. By starting their own agribusiness, it ensures food security to help build a better future for their children and create stable employment in their homeland. They expect to get their first big sale of their produce in November of this year!


Some of the NATEC's family members can grow their own vegetables to supply their kitchens and increase the nutrition of the meals which they feed to their  children. Now, they do not need to forage through the forest for hours to collect their food.

<p>AHREM was founded in
July 2011 by Khaing Zaw Zaw and David Fisher with the goal of educating the
impoverished youth of the Arakan State in Myanmar who were forced to abandon
their education in Myanmar due to economic circumstances.  Before a student is accepted by us, they must complete an interview process during which we determine whether the student shows great enthusiasm for studying
and giving back to their home community. If we recognize these qualities in a student, he is invited to study at the AHREM office in Mae Sot
completely free of charge. AHREM
provides students with the basic skills they need in
order to continue their educations and live successful lives supporting
their communities. More specifically, AHREM aims to give students the basic skills (typically English competency and basic computer skills) necessary in order to be accepted
into higher education programs at other organizations. AHREM students are also taught human and environmental
rights topics, as many of the students were not exposed to these issues in their native villages. When a student has completed all available higher education programs in Mae Sot and pursued university scholarship opportunities,
AHREM sends the student back to the Arakan State in Myanmar to share their new skills with the students at our AHREM office in the Arakan State, which we opened in the spring of 2016.
AHREM is 100% donation funded and taught completely by volunteers, with much of our funding coming directly from the organizations founders, so we are dependent on your generosity to continue our program's operations. <br/></p>
<p>For further information,
please visit us at <a href=""http://www.ahrem.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.ahrem.org</a></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The AHREM Mae Sot office's weekly expenses are 4,088 baht ($116), which allows 13 students to live full-time in the office (we have another location in Myanmar as well). This money will be used to pay for our rent, food costs, teaching and school supplies, utilities, and other necessities. This is a small amount, but we struggle to provide for our weekly expenses. With your donation, AHREM will be able to educate more poor Arakanese students. <br/></p>
<p>Even if don't reach our fundraising goal, your donation will still make a significant impact and help us to provide for our students' needs.<br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>AHREM is educating poor Arakanese students in Mae Sot, Thailand and now also directly inside of the Arakan State in
Myanmar. AHREM has empowered many students from Myanmar, many of whom are now working in Thailand or inside Myanmar to support
their families. Others are helping their communities through teaching or volunteering at AHREM offices and reach new students. Students leave AHREM with improved English and computer skills and an increased understanding of environmental and human rights issues. These skills increase their professional opportunities and the critical thinking skills they develop help them throughout their lives. Through AHREM's passionate and optimistic students we believe we can reduce poverty and increase educational and economic opportunities in rural communities in  Myanmar. Please help AHREM and Myanmar reach our goals by
donating to our campaign! </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge for us is funding. With insufficient funds, we are unable to help all of the students who risk travelling illegally from Myanmar to continue their educations. For the students living in our offices, we cannot provide legal identification documents, which would allow the students to study legally in Thailand, so our students are constantly at risk of being arrested and deported. Because of this risk, students are not permitted to leave the school and unfortunately often feel a lack a freedom while studying in Thailand. With greater funding AHREM could provide students with proper legal documentation and offer students more freedom while they study. Please help us improve the lives of our students who work hard to better their communities and break the cycle of poverty that is sadly often found in Myanmar.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>AHREM is trying to provide the uneducated people of Myanmar with the skills necessary to improve their lives and communities. Moreover, AHREM would greatly appreciate if you could share this information with as many people as possible. The more people we can share our cause with, the larger the positive impact for the people of Myanmar. Thank you so much for your generosity! Every donation counts!!!<br/></p>

  Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge for us is funding. With insufficient funds, we are unable to help all of the students who risk travelling illegally from Myanmar to continue their educations. For the students living in our offices, we cannot provide legal identification documents, which would allow the students to study legally in Thailand, so our students are constantly at risk of being arrested and deported. Because of this risk, students are not permitted to leave the school and unfortunately often feel a lack a freedom while studying in Thailand. With greater funding AHREM could provide students with proper legal documentation and offer students more freedom while they study. Please help us improve the lives of our students who work hard to better their communities and break the cycle of poverty that is sadly often found in Myanmar.
  Other Ways You Can Help


AHREM is trying to provide the uneducated people of Myanmar with the skills necessary to improve their lives and communities. Moreover, AHREM would greatly appreciate if you could share this information with as many people as possible. The more people we can share our cause with, the larger the positive impact for the people of Myanmar. Thank you so much for your generosity! Every donation counts!!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

The Impact</span><br/></span>
</div><div> <p></p>
<p>Perché quattro laboratori?</p>
<p>lo sforzo di attivare ben quattro percorsi laboratoriali
nasce dalla convinzione che sia necessario, al fine di favorire
l’apprendimento, rispettare le attitudini, gli interessi, ma anche le
difficoltà motorie e/o verbali di ogni persona. Inoltre, li dove possibile, la
partecipazione a più laboratori aumenta l’entusiasmo, l’aggregazione, la
relazione all’interno e all’esterno del gruppo. L’obiettivo è quello di
dimostrare come le persone con disabilità siano capaci di assumere un ruolo
attivo nella società  che supera il
concetto stereotipato dell’assistenzialismo, <b>partecipando alla vita  culturale
della collettività</b>. </p>
<p><i>Ricercare il ritmo,
suonare uno strumento, immortalare l’immagine del mondo coi loro occhi,
percepire il proprio corpo in un fare armonico, trascrivere un pensiero e
migliorare le proprie capacità espositive, questi i nostri orizzonti.</i></p>
<p><b>I singoli Progetti</b></p>
<p>-<span> 
</span><b>Il
corso di fotografia</b></p>
<p>Il corso di fotografia e
video si propone di insegnare le tecniche di base e la strumentazione
necessarie per le riproduzioni video e fotografiche.  Inoltre si prefigge l’obiettivo di stimolare
la creatività in relazione alla capacità di “fermare” momenti, cose, persone in
situazioni diverse.</p>

<p>Comunicare
con il linguaggio corporeo integrando musica, movimento ed emozioni; sviluppare
le capacità espressive; sviluppare le capacità immaginative; Accrescere la
stima di sé; migliorare la qualità dei rapporti interpersonali.</p>
<p>-<span> 
</span><b>Il corso
di lettura e composizione</b></p>
<p>Il corso intende sviluppare le pregresse capacità e competenze linguistico-espressive, sia di scriventi che di lettori, in tre direzioni: veicolare le idee individuali al meglio; incanalare con soddisfazione personale la propria partecipazione alla comunicazione sociale; migliorare l’ascolto e la comprensione di contesti comunicativi istituzionali o ricreativi non orali.</p>
<p>-<span>  </span><b>Il corso di Musica</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Il corso di musica ha come obiettivo lo sviluppo dell' orecchio interno, la competenza mentale fondamentale per la produzione di qualsiasi idea musicale; educare l' orecchio dei partecipanti al riconoscimento consapevole del singolo suono e dei diversi stili musicali.</p>
<p>Alla fine dei percorsi, i partecipanti verranno coinvolti nella realizzazione di un documentario che intrecci le singole storie dei personaggi. Il montaggio alternerà ogni singola storia fino a farle convogliare tutte in un grande evento collettivo.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>We
need your help to make our four training programs based on Music, Biodance,
Photography &amp; Video, Reading &amp; Composition a reality. These programs
will help people with Down syndrome create a realistic self-image and will help
them gain the necessary skills to act as independently as possible. These four
courses will enhance learning while constantly respecting the different
attitudes and different interests each person has while also respecting the
difficulties that each person may face. Searching for the beat, playing an
instrument, looking at the world through their own eyes, perceiving their
bodies in a harmonious way, writing down their thoughts and improving their
presentation skills… all of these things will give birth to an authentic
subjectivity and will stimulate their capacity for self-sufficiency and give
them direction for their future and present life choices.</p>

So together, let’s build the AIPD “House of Arts”…

The Impact
 
Perché quattro laboratori?
lo sforzo di attivare ben quattro percorsi laboratoriali
nasce dalla convinzione che sia necessario, al fine di favorire
l’apprendimento, rispettare le attitudini, gli interessi, ma anche le
difficoltà motorie e/o verbali di ogni persona. Inoltre, li dove possibile, la
partecipazione a più laboratori aumenta l’entusiasmo, l’aggregazione, la
relazione all’interno e all’esterno del gruppo. L’obiettivo è quello di
dimostrare come le persone con disabilità siano capaci di assumere un ruolo
attivo nella società  che supera il
concetto stereotipato dell’assistenzialismo, partecipando alla vita  culturale
della collettività. 
Ricercare il ritmo,
suonare uno strumento, immortalare l’immagine del mondo coi loro occhi,
percepire il proprio corpo in un fare armonico, trascrivere un pensiero e
migliorare le proprie capacità espositive, questi i nostri orizzonti.
I singoli Progetti
- 
Il
corso di fotografia
Il corso di fotografia e
video si propone di insegnare le tecniche di base e la strumentazione
necessarie per le riproduzioni video e fotografiche.  Inoltre si prefigge l’obiettivo di stimolare
la creatività in relazione alla capacità di “fermare” momenti, cose, persone in
situazioni diverse.
- 
Il corso
di biodanza
Comunicare
con il linguaggio corporeo integrando musica, movimento ed emozioni; sviluppare
le capacità espressive; sviluppare le capacità immaginative; Accrescere la
stima di sé; migliorare la qualità dei rapporti interpersonali.
- 
Il corso
di lettura e composizione
Il corso intende sviluppare le pregresse capacità e competenze linguistico-espressive, sia di scriventi che di lettori, in tre direzioni: veicolare le idee individuali al meglio; incanalare con soddisfazione personale la propria partecipazione alla comunicazione sociale; migliorare l’ascolto e la comprensione di contesti comunicativi istituzionali o ricreativi non orali.
-  Il corso di Musica

Il corso di musica ha come obiettivo lo sviluppo dell' orecchio interno, la competenza mentale fondamentale per la produzione di qualsiasi idea musicale; educare l' orecchio dei partecipanti al riconoscimento consapevole del singolo suono e dei diversi stili musicali.
Alla fine dei percorsi, i partecipanti verranno coinvolti nella realizzazione di un documentario che intrecci le singole storie dei personaggi. Il montaggio alternerà ogni singola storia fino a farle convogliare tutte in un grande evento collettivo.

We
need your help to make our four training programs based on Music, Biodance,
Photography & Video, Reading & Composition a reality. These programs
will help people with Down syndrome create a realistic self-image and will help
them gain the necessary skills to act as independently as possible. These four
courses will enhance learning while constantly respecting the different
attitudes and different interests each person has while also respecting the
difficulties that each person may face. Searching for the beat, playing an
instrument, looking at the world through their own eyes, perceiving their
bodies in a harmonious way, writing down their thoughts and improving their
presentation skills… all of these things will give birth to an authentic
subjectivity and will stimulate their capacity for self-sufficiency and give
them direction for their future and present life choices.

<h4>Hi Everybody!</h4>
<p>My name is Duncan and I live in England. Since 2006 I have been teaching spoken English to the world via YouTube. I have been doing this on my own and in my own time for free. I do not charge anything to anyone for my material. During the past eight years I have helped thousands of people of all ages around the world improve their spoken English. My lessons are video based, which allows me to make them in a fun and creative way, using vivid imagery. Virtually all of my video lessons are subtitled. Of course all of this producing takes time...and there are overheads (running costs) to meet. -  (In the past I have worked abroad as an English teacher and spent 4 years teaching oral English in China.) </p>
<h4>Popularity...</h4>
<p>Many thousands of students in over 125 countries now follow my lessons, which means that I must devote more of my time to this venture. I have already invested a large sum of my own money to create a studio and purchase equipment so as to produce as many new lessons as possible. My subscriber base is growing. Right now it stands at over 300.000. In the future I would like to expand this virtual classroom and increase the output, ensuring that many more people will benefit from these free video lessons. </p>
<h4>The world of English is a fun and exciting place.</h4>
<p>There is no doubt that these days the English language is widely used. It has become an international language. Having the ability to communicate in English can really open doors for people of all ages. Your help will allow many more people to take advantage of the various life-changing opportunities that the English language can offer.</p>
<p><b>New for 2015...</b></p>
<p>In 2015 I aim to expand the production time even further, with a new series of English lessons called 'Misterduncan's Full English'. I began making these lessons at the end of 2014 and I would like to continue making them in 2015. A new lesson will be posted every two weeks. </p>

</div></div>","Hello,Thank you for visiting!My name is Marco, I live in the Netherlands, and am a music-hobbyist, songwriter, charital entrepreneur and founder of a non-profit organization. On personal initiative I've decided to raise funds to help build an educational centre for children and single women in Bangladesh.





Marco Akamawa


The Project

The aim, with your much needed help, is to fully renovate an existing building (currently unfit for habitation and has no roof) so it can be safely and durably house up to 48 children and 16 women, and provide the furniture & necessities so that already available teachers can start teaching as soon as possible in safe and caring circumstance.Right now children of various age groups, some very young, are following their lessons under extreme circumstances, on barren floor, at different locations (on porches of houses, and in primitive provisional shelters, without chairs, tables, proper schoolbooks, clothing or even floormats) in exceptionally cold weather, with the only alternative to go (back) living on city-streets with possibly disastrous consequences. Single women, rejected by family, hardly have means (due lack of schooling) to support children or themselves.Although government-funding is periodically made available, money spiralling down a too long line seldomly reaches the correct endstation, also due to a 'defective' local organization.An important part of our goal is to create a certain independence, without letting politics or religious beliefs interfere the education of these children in any way, whilst at all times ensuring political, religious beliefs and especially cultural aspects are respected and remain intact. This will be done by frequenly producing film, music and artwork as means of exposure and support, also with the help of other artists around the world. 

September 2014, new books! (made available via private money)

September 2014, one of the provisional ""classrooms""




September 2014, ""classroom"" on some-one's frontporch



I plan on heading over as soon as possible to help on site with the renovationwork (I'm good with my hands and have local experience), and will be filming/producing a documentary with the help of Dr. Shahida Akther, a known author, filmmaker and well-respected human-rights defender. 
I will be posting ('live' if technically possible) daily updates to various media-websites, to keep contact with you and the rest of the world, and out of safety-reason.
Together, with your help, we will be ready to create a sustainable basis for these children and women, a basis on which we plan to actively develope a transparent ongoing story into the foreseeable future, envisioning a relatively self-supportive educational centre, one of more in longer term.

 
Estimated cost-breakdown:



Renovation of building (material/transport):  USD 2.250,-
Renovation of building (labour):                           USD    600,-
Furniture / amenities:                                              USD    500,-
Books / pens / paper (1 year supply)                 USD     150,-
Sewing-machines                                                      USD     750,-
Travel Marco (airline/food/other)                      USD  1.000,-
Unforseen / contingency                                        USD  1.250,-

                                                                          TOTAL:         USD  6.500,-

Contingencyplan:

Now what if we do not reach our US$ 6500 goal ? 
Firstly I'd like to point out that 6500 US$ are equivalent to provide a child a brighter future at a price of approx. 100,- US$.
Though I do realize a contingency-plan as some form of guarantee is necessary:
I've produced a music-album (10 original songs & 4 bonustracks), it's paid for and am dedicating the entire gross sales-revenue to this project. 
You may listen to it here: 'MOONLIGHT by Marco Akamawa'
If you happen to like what you hear, it's made available as a 'perk' if you decide to make a donation.
A physical audio-cd and informative booklet are currently in production and should enter stores before Feb. 14 (Valentine's Day). If needed I will ensure these proceeds also can serve as contingency. Furthermore, I reserve proceeds of gigs and concerts to this project, as safety-plan C.





      Very much we look forward to your help and participation!
