<p class=""p2"">We all like ice cream, so why should those who like a particular flavour miss out on all the fun? The Ice Cream Truck of Love is a non-political, areligious campaign to raise awareness for marriage equality in Australia.</p>
<p class=""p2"">The Senate is currently evaluating its stance on same-sex marriage in Australia, though, we believe this decision belongs with you. Our aim is to send our truck around the country offering ice cream and positive support of marriage equality, all with a simple message: Everyone deserves the opportunity to marry the person they love, no matter the flavour.</p>
<h2 class=""p1""><strong>What We Plan On Doing</strong></h2>
<p class=""p2"">Starting in Sydney, working its way up to Brisbane and then back down the Australian eastern seaboard, the Ice Cream Truck of Love will appear in highly-frequented areas such as city centres, sporting venues and popular landmarks to spread the message to the real people of Australia. In exchange for ice cream, the public can learn how they can become involved in righting the country's stance on same-sex marriage.</p>
<h2 class=""p1""><strong>How We Plan On Doing It</strong></h2>
<p class=""p2"">Through the generous support of financial contribution and pro bono services from our corporate partners, we hope to raise sufficient funds to see the Ice Cream Truck of Love's roadtip realised. Anything above our target will go back into the campaign in order to visit other capital cities and regional centres.</p>
<h2 class=""p1""><strong>How We'll Use Your Donation</strong></h2>
<p class=""p2"">Your kind donation will go directly to funding the Ice Cream Truck of Love and its operation. This will involve leasing and transporting the ice cream truck, hiring of promotional and security staff, insurance, printing of promotional material and accomodation of our Ice Cream Truck of Love team. We appreciate your generosity and in turn will give you our complete commitment to the cause.</p>
<h2 class=""p1""><strong>Why We're Doing It</strong></h2>
<p class=""p2"">We believe it's time this country revisited its outmoded stance on marriage equality. It has nothing to do with religion, nor should be paired with a certain party's political agenda—we just want a basic human right to be offered to everyone.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Please support by contributing to the crowd-funded campaign or by becoming a volunteer. Together we can get the Ice Cream Truck of Love and Australia on the road to marriage equality.</p>

<h3>History and Background</h3>
<p>Brian Hobbs has a passion for wine and small business.  Upon finding this location in Maplewood, he knew that is was the perfect location for beginning a dream with his wife and daughter.  </p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, Brian's passion for wine was ignited at Stonehome Wine Bar in Brooklyn New York-rated number one wine bar two years in a row during his tenure at the bar.  An Advanced Sommelier through the Wine and Spirits Education Trust based out of London, and a Certified Sommelier through the Court of Master Sommeliers, Brian brings not only a passion but education that allows him to procure a wide variety of wines at every price point-from value driven wines for the everyday wine drinker to the collector wines for a wine enthusiast.  </p>
<p>The relationships he has built in St. Louis over the last five years with wine distributors and importers provide access to allocated wines that not all have access to in the area.  Based on his experience and these relationships, Chateau Maplewood will provide you with a value that you cannot get at any shop.  </p>

<h3>Help Us Make More Booze</h3>
<p>Triple Sun Spirits Co is growing, but we need your help to do it faster. We're raising $10,000 to we can buy two new Stripping Stills, which will allow us to double our capacity, and make more booze faster. </p>
<p>Opened in 2016, Triple Sun is the first and oldest distillery in Emmaus, PA. We've been growing steadily ever since, laying down our first barrel of bourbon to age August 2016, and recently releasing a special aged Stouted Whiskey with <a href=""http://www.weyerbacher.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Weyerbacher</a> for their 22nd anniversary. </p>
<p>Our goal is to make more booze faster, so we can fill bottles, and more barrels. To do that, we need two new Stripping Stills. They'll help us double our production, so we can make more liquor in less time. This will allow us to fill bottles for sale, as well as barrels for aging, instead of choosing one or the other. </p>

<h3>We are on a mission</h3>
<p>We’re on a mission to breed natural flavors back into vegetables so we can develop the next-gen, plant-based products.</p>
<p>We all know that vegetables are healthy and sustainable, we should eat more of them. But, The problem with vegetables is taste! The majority of us just don't like the taste of vegetables. On top of that, industrially-grown vegetables hardly contain any nutrients and taste bland.</p>
<p>What if vegetables could be as tasty as your favorite snacks? <br/>This challenge brought a breeder, a food scientist, a designer, and a 3 Michelin star chef together with a mission: shift people's perception of veggies from boring to exciting.</p>

<strong>Do I need to soak the nuts? </strong>No. The NutraMilk uses only raw nuts and water to make nut butters and nut milks in under 12 minutes.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>
<strong>Does it make Soy Milk? </strong>No. Soy milk requires heating. The NutraMilk does not heat the ingredients, so the nut milk is ready to drink as soon as you make it.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>
<strong>What kinds of nut milks can I make with the NutraMilk? </strong>The NutraMilk makes nut butter and nut milk from virtually any type of nut.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>
<strong>What is the ratio of nuts to water? </strong>Two cups of nuts to two liters (or 8 cups) of water, so the ratio is 15% nuts to water. Each cup of nuts yields approximately 4 cups of milk.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>
<strong>Why does almond milk take longer to make than some of the other nut milks? </strong>The almonds take a little more time to breakdown. Twelve minutes for almonds and seven - eight minutes for all the other milks.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>
<strong>What temperature water should I use? </strong>You should use room temperature.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>
<strong>Is it temperature regulated or does it need to be transferred to another container afterwards for refrigeration? </strong>The NutraMilk does not regulate temperature, and the mixing container is not designed to be placed into the refrigerator. Once the milk is dispensed into a separate container, that container should be placed into a refrigerator. The separate container will be included with the NutraMilk when it hits the market.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>
<strong>Does the NutraMilk achieve pasteurized end product? </strong>The process of pasteurization requires sustained heating and rapid cooling. Since the NutraMilk does not regulate temperature, it does not pasteurize the nut milk produced.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>
<strong>How smooth is the end product? </strong>Prior to becoming nut milk, the nuts are made into a nut butter. When water is added, the milk is filtered through a 100 Mesh stainless filter, so it's pretty darn smooth!</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>
<strong>I can make nut milk in my blender already. Why would I buy this instead? </strong>Making nut milk in a traditional blender requires nuts to be soaked for several hours or overnight. Once the soaked nuts have been blended, the pulp is still in the milk. The resulting mixture must be strained through a cheesecloth (or something similar) which is a messy and time-consuming process. The NutraMilk takes the mess, time and hassle out of the process.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>
<strong>Will NutraMilk be available in 220v? </strong>Yes, we have the 220v machine available. It should be ready to ship in December, pending country-specific certifications. Please select the ""220v NutraMilk"" Reward and note that it has a later shipping date.</li></ul><p> </p><ul><li>
<strong>Can I make less than 2L of nut milk? </strong>Yes, you can make 1L with 1 cup of nuts. </li></ul></div>","Do you love fresh nut milk, but you don’t love the tedious process of making it at home? Are you tired of soaking nuts for hours or overnight only to have your nut milk last for a few days? Do you prefer nut milk that is chemical- and preservative-free? We understand. That’s why Brewista developed the NutraMilk.   NutraMilk’s patented, revolutionary method of making delicious, healthy nut milk from virtually any type of nut makes the once tedious process simple and fast. With NutraMilk, you can make up to two liters of your favorite nut milk in less than 12 minutes, compared to the hours or days it takes using other methods, and at half the cost. Unlike any other nut processor, its revolutionary design is patented, BPA free and UL certified, so you know it’s safe to use right now.   If you’re tired of chemical- and preservative-filled milks, or making your own using old-fashioned methods, NutraMilk is your ideal solution. Gone are the days of it taking hours to make your own nut milk and butter. Forget soaking, grinding and straining nuts for the milk that you want. Whether you need cashew milk for your coffee, nut butter for your celery or toast or want to create your own unique nut milk blend for a healthy snack or beverage alternative, NutraMilk is for you. With NutraMilk, you can make your own nut milks and butters in just 7 to 12 minutes!      *This step will create the nut butter. If nut butter is what you desire, skip to Step Three.      Other nut milks can be loaded with chemicals and preservatives to keep the product fresh. Now, the NutraMilk nut processor lets you make two liters of smooth and delicious, ready-to-drink, 100% preservative- and chemical-free nut milk. NutraMilk is BPA free and has been submitted for NSF certification.It's no secret that homemade nut milk often takes more time to make than it does to actually consume it. Now, you're less than 12 minutes away from two liters of deliciousness. You can make fresh nut milk in less time than it takes to brew a pot of coffee!Unlike traditional methods that take up a ton of space on your counter and use a bunch of different kitchen accessories, the NutraMilk components can be put in the dishwasher for easy cleaning. Built to commercial standards, NutraMilk will stand up to heavy daily use. The container is also dishwasher safe for fast, easy clean up. Say goodbye to a messy kitchen!NutraMilk can make it all!

Most legal ebony is used these days in the music industry – for fingerboards, pegs, picks, and other small parts.

We’re really excited about this relationship, because it’s a way for us to put into practice in a sustainable way the philosophy of “using the whole pig,” if you will – not wasting a precious resource that is valuable and scarce. In addition, by being an end-user of legal, secondary ebony wood stock, we’ll be supporting the sustainability efforts of ebony growers in Cameroon.  </p><p>Here’s an incredible clip of Bob Taylor explaining the ebony wood crisis, and what he and his team are doing to support sustainable harvesting practices in Cameroon.  Video used courtesy of Taylor Guitars.</p><div><div>

<p>We are so pleased to be a part of this story!</p>
</div></div><h3>Our Design Philosophy</h3><ul>
<li><p>Quality - with so many corners being cut in manufacturing today, our goal is to bring a standard of quality to our tools that takes us back to the era of the 40's and 50's, when products were built to last. This era also contributes to our design aesthetics, because mid-century tools were as beautiful and classic as they were sturdy.</p></li>
<li><p>Beauty - because we're artists, aesthetic design is crucial to us.  We will not design ugly tools, no matter how functional they are.</p></li>
<li><p>Originality - again, probably because we're artists, and we have a great deal of artistic integrity.  We are not interested in creating something that already exists, so we consider innovation in every product we design.</p></li>
</ul><p>Not all products require the same kind of innovation - with our cocktail spoons, we addressed issues with functionality and longevity.  With our mixing glass, we've addressed issues of price point and accessibility to a beautiful glass. We're making a muddler the way it should be - strong, natural, and firm. We're making the first readily available Ebony Muddler - using wood so dense that it's nearly impregnable to liquid, with a handle that will give the most amazing user experience.</p><h2>Design Process &amp; Product Details</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481340624/xrebod60tbxprtg70b8m.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>Mixing Glass Design</h3><p><strong>FUNCTION </strong>- Gorgeous aesthetics aside, from a functionality standpoint, this Mixing Glass is incredible! We've used it ourselves, it's been used by bartenders, has spent time in several high volume bars, and we've gotten great feedback.  Some highlights are:</p><ul>
<li>Feels very natural (effortless even) when stirring with a barspoon - it's a good diameter for the mechanics of barspoon use and the spoon flows like butter around the inside of the glass</li>
<li>Weighted Bottom - feels great! It's heavier than a tin or a Pyrex glass so it stays where you put it, which makes it less likely to slide around and fall off the bar.</li>
<li>Walls of the glass are a good thickness (4 mm) - feels sturdy, but not overdone. Thinner glass means cocktails chill more quickly.</li>
<li>The top rim of the glass is nice and thin (as thick as the walls) - so no unsightly bulging.</li>
<li>This glass fits a lot of liquid for its size.  It is in no way oversized in your hand, measuring about 3.5 inches (9 cm) in diameter, but has plenty of room inside - it comes in at a whopping 24 oz, or about 700 ml.</li>
<li>Fits really nicely in the hand when straining - not too big (or heavy) to handle</li>
<li>Fits a Hawthorne strainer like a glove</li>
</ul><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481340653/kw489adagllun2mws8ge.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>AESTHETICS</strong> - We've gotten a lot of ""WOW"" moments from folks who love mixing glasses when we show them this one. Here's an overview of some of the aesthetic design features:</p><ul>
<li>Antique hammered glass finish - we wanted something different than some of the popular cut glass designs out there today, so we opted for one like hammered glass. It’s subtle, provides texture, and feels natural and organic, like raindrops, leaves, or ripples in a lake. It reflects light incredibly, and makes any cocktail come alive.  </li>
<li>Spout design - small and dainty, not something that looks like a giant, unsightly upside down nose:</li>
</ul><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481340678/hamau72jwmpdakacoocu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><ul>
<li>Weighted Bottom - because it just feels good and solid when you set it down, and it stays where you put it.  It reminds us of those nice Old Fashioned Glasses used in Madmen... there's just something about a beautiful slab of glass...</li>
<li>Seam v. Seamless - For those of you that own a few mixing glasses already, you may be aware that some mixing glasses are seamed, and some are seamless. The seam does not impact performance, but it costs more to eliminate it, because it's a different manufacturing process. To keep our costs low, and therefore to keep the price point at a reasonable place, this mixing glass does have seams. However, the texture on the glass makes those seams a lot less noticeable, and we think it’s worked wonderfully. So wonderfully, in fact, that we found them incredibly difficult to photograph!</li>
</ul><h3>Maple Muddler Design: </h3><p>We designed our Muddler out of solid, dense maple wood, with a nice big flat muddle end. It measures 10"" long, with a 3/4"" diameter on the small end, and a 1-3/8"" diameter on the large end. Some smaller diameter muddlers allow a stubborn strawberry or slippery cucumber to get away too quickly – you can really pin them down with this one. </p><p>It’s got a straight, simple design which just looks amazing and makes it aerodynamically easy to clean quickly. And it contains no stains or varnishes (those can flake off into your cocktail!) - it’s finished with natural mineral oil only. We recommend periodically applying mineral oil as a maintenance process, which is recommended for all wooden kitchen tools as a life-extending measure.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481340729/e6wqypr1fd7qkowpaez5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481340824/dhofjta4hrsnrgds04b8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Since this muddler is made from natural wood, variations and markings in grain patterns are guaranteed - each Muddler is completely unique!</p><h3>Ebony Muddler Design: </h3><p>Very similar in diameter to our Maple Muddle, the Ebony Muddler also features a sophisticated, ergonomically satisfying handle. It’s quite lovely, and makes grasping a very gratifying experience.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481340862/inl0gi85rxqgm0663sxx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Our Ebony Muddlers have no stain or finish. Ebony is so dense that sanding and polishing are all the finish it needs. These muddlers are so beautiful and so durable that they will easily become treasured heritage pieces in your bar collection.</p><p>A Note on Color: Ebony has a reputation as being pure black, but that’s not how all ebony is. If you watched the video of Bob Taylor (above) shedding light on ebony harvesting practices, you’ll have learned that only about 1 in every 10 ebony trees has a solid black core. The only way to know if an ebony tree was solid black in the middle was to chop down trees until you found one. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481340885/lhxepdletzxxfwwnmxik.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Rather than continue this grossly unsustainable practice of wasteful harvesting in order to supply ebony consumers with pure black wood, all 10 trees are now harvested and supplied to end users. This means that 1) we won’t run out of ebony, and 2) the ebony that is now used today has color in it.  </p><p>And it’s beautiful! Swirls and fades of grey and blonde add character and a completely unique aesthetic to each muddler we make. So please embrace this new era of ebony, and celebrate the color of the wood with us!</p><h2>The Aero and Wingman Cocktail Spoons</h2><p>Missed our first crowdfunding campaign?  These spoons were the result.  The Mixing Glass and Muddlers pair perfectly with these beauties.  You don't have to wait if you want to buy one of these - they are available on our website at <a href=""http://standardspoon.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.standardspoon.com</a>, But we do have one Perk that includes both spoons - the Cocktailian Benefactor!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481340953/veragrwd3muleaa4ubzg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The Aero Cocktail Spoon (top) and Wingman Spinning Cocktail Spoon (below)</p><p>Here's a little description of the spoons; for more details, <a href=""http://standardspoon.com/tools"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Visit our Website</a>.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481340994/n3wxesuce0oz8xbeleky.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>Aero Cocktail Spoon: </h3><p>While most straight-handled bar spoons are tacked together with a weak weld and often break, ours is fused into one piece for a seamless design.  Its slim profile is easy to insert around the ice in a mixing glass, and its aerodynamic body is great for near-friction-less stirring (perfect for left-handed use too).

When we started out with cocktails years ago, we used a pint glass and a chopstick to stir our first Old Fashioned Cocktail.  Not my proudest moment, but hey - we didn't know any better, and hadn't collected the right tools yet!In the years since that first Old Fashioned, we've loved improving our cocktail experience with quality tools.  We even went so far as to re-design the barspoon, and successfully funded a crowdfunding campaign in 2014 to have two designs produced (yay!).We're back to solve problems with two other cocktail tools: The Mixing Glass, used for stirred cocktails, and The Muddler, used for crushing fruit and vegetables, and pressing herbs and aromatics:A Cocktail Mixing Glass: A Mixing Glass is used for stirred drinks as the prepping vessel. Always STIR cocktails when they contain only clear spirits and liqueurs, like the Old Fashioned, Martini, Manhattan, or Sazerac Cocktails. Add your spirits and other ingredients to the Mixing Glass, add ice, and stir to chill and dilute before straining into the glass you're serving in.A good Mixing Glass makes this stirring and serving experience a really enjoyable one, and guests love it.PROBLEM: Many of the fine, beautiful mixing glasses we love are very expensive ($45-60), and those that are more economical ($10-20) leave something (sometimes a LOT) to be desired in the design department. SOLUTION: We created a Mixing Glass that was stunning to look at, but didn't break the bank. Especially considering the fact that mixing glasses often DO break, it needed to be affordably replaceable. A Hardwood Muddler:Muddlers are sometimes used in stirred cocktails, like the Old Fashioned when you want to use a fancy sugar cube instead of simple syrup - use the Muddler to crush up sugar and mix it with bitters before adding your bourbon. More often, muddlers are used for shaken cocktails that contain herbs, aromatics, fruits or vegetables.  A Muddler is used to press fresh mint to extract its oils, and to crush cucumber, berries, and other ingredients for shaken cocktails.It's also an essential bar tool for crushing ice in a lewis bag to make drinks like the Mint Julep Cocktail.   PROBLEMS: There are a lot of problems with muddlers.

$2500 for Marketing the Mixing Glass - We have a huge fan base among bartenders.  They would LOVE to have this Mixing Glass in their bars, and we mostly designed it at this price point for them.  However, getting the word out to them, (and especially to the distribution companies that supply their restaurants and bars with tools) is difficult. We need to get some marketing materials together, and get in front of the right people, which could mean going to trade shows / conferences.  Considering a booth at a trade show usually costs around $2K by itself, the more funds we can gather in this department, the more widely distributed the glass will be.

Pete Lowry, ebony and rosewood expert at the Missouri Botanical Garden, calls the Madagascar ebony wood trade the ""equivalent of Africa's blood diamonds.""So… why are we making an Ebony muddler?  We have another story to tell about Ebony – and it starts in Cameroon, the last place in the world where Ebony can still be legally obtained. Most legal ebony is used these days in the music industry – for fingerboards, pegs, picks, and other small parts. However, not all of the ebony that comes to the instrument factories is exactly what they need - it’s too short for a fingerboard, or has a wormhole in it, or some other minor imperfection.We’ve partnered with Taylor Guitars here in San Diego to make use of the ebony they’ve acquired that cannot be used for guitar making. We’re really excited about this relationship, because it’s a way for us to put into practice in a sustainable way the philosophy of “using the whole pig,” if you will – not wasting a precious resource that is valuable and scarce. In addition, by being an end-user of legal, secondary ebony wood stock, we’ll be supporting the sustainability efforts of ebony growers in Cameroon.  Here’s an incredible clip of Bob Taylor explaining the ebony wood crisis, and what he and his team are doing to support sustainable harvesting practices in Cameroon.  Video used courtesy of Taylor Guitars.

We are so pleased to be a part of this story!
Our Design Philosophy
Quality - with so many corners being cut in manufacturing today, our goal is to bring a standard of quality to our tools that takes us back to the era of the 40's and 50's, when products were built to last. This era also contributes to our design aesthetics, because mid-century tools were as beautiful and classic as they were sturdy.
Beauty - because we're artists, aesthetic design is crucial to us.  We will not design ugly tools, no matter how functional they are.
Originality - again, probably because we're artists, and we have a great deal of artistic integrity.  We are not interested in creating something that already exists, so we consider innovation in every product we design.
Not all products require the same kind of innovation - with our cocktail spoons, we addressed issues with functionality and longevity.  With our mixing glass, we've addressed issues of price point and accessibility to a beautiful glass. We're making a muddler the way it should be - strong, natural, and firm. We're making the first readily available Ebony Muddler - using wood so dense that it's nearly impregnable to liquid, with a handle that will give the most amazing user experience.Design Process & Product DetailsMixing Glass DesignFUNCTION - Gorgeous aesthetics aside, from a functionality standpoint, this Mixing Glass is incredible! We've used it ourselves, it's been used by bartenders, has spent time in several high volume bars, and we've gotten great feedback.  Some highlights are:
Feels very natural (effortless even) when stirring with a barspoon - it's a good diameter for the mechanics of barspoon use and the spoon flows like butter around the inside of the glass
Weighted Bottom - feels great! It's heavier than a tin or a Pyrex glass so it stays where you put it, which makes it less likely to slide around and fall off the bar.
Walls of the glass are a good thickness (4 mm) - feels sturdy, but not overdone. Thinner glass means cocktails chill more quickly.
The top rim of the glass is nice and thin (as thick as the walls) - so no unsightly bulging.
This glass fits a lot of liquid for its size.  It is in no way oversized in your hand, measuring about 3.5 inches (9 cm) in diameter, but has plenty of room inside - it comes in at a whopping 24 oz, or about 700 ml.
Fits really nicely in the hand when straining - not too big (or heavy) to handle
Fits a Hawthorne strainer like a glove
AESTHETICS - We've gotten a lot of ""WOW"" moments from folks who love mixing glasses when we show them this one. Here's an overview of some of the aesthetic design features:
Antique hammered glass finish - we wanted something different than some of the popular cut glass designs out there today, so we opted for one like hammered glass. It’s subtle, provides texture, and feels natural and organic, like raindrops, leaves, or ripples in a lake. It reflects light incredibly, and makes any cocktail come alive.  
Spout design - small and dainty, not something that looks like a giant, unsightly upside down nose:

Weighted Bottom - because it just feels good and solid when you set it down, and it stays where you put it.  It reminds us of those nice Old Fashioned Glasses used in Madmen... there's just something about a beautiful slab of glass...
Seam v. Seamless - For those of you that own a few mixing glasses already, you may be aware that some mixing glasses are seamed, and some are seamless. The seam does not impact performance, but it costs more to eliminate it, because it's a different manufacturing process. To keep our costs low, and therefore to keep the price point at a reasonable place, this mixing glass does have seams. However, the texture on the glass makes those seams a lot less noticeable, and we think it’s worked wonderfully. So wonderfully, in fact, that we found them incredibly difficult to photograph!
Maple Muddler Design: We designed our Muddler out of solid, dense maple wood, with a nice big flat muddle end. It measures 10"" long, with a 3/4"" diameter on the small end, and a 1-3/8"" diameter on the large end. Some smaller diameter muddlers allow a stubborn strawberry or slippery cucumber to get away too quickly – you can really pin them down with this one. It’s got a straight, simple design which just looks amazing and makes it aerodynamically easy to clean quickly. And it contains no stains or varnishes (those can flake off into your cocktail!) - it’s finished with natural mineral oil only. We recommend periodically applying mineral oil as a maintenance process, which is recommended for all wooden kitchen tools as a life-extending measure.Since this muddler is made from natural wood, variations and markings in grain patterns are guaranteed - each Muddler is completely unique!Ebony Muddler Design: Very similar in diameter to our Maple Muddle, the Ebony Muddler also features a sophisticated, ergonomically satisfying handle. It’s quite lovely, and makes grasping a very gratifying experience.Our Ebony Muddlers have no stain or finish. Ebony is so dense that sanding and polishing are all the finish it needs. These muddlers are so beautiful and so durable that they will easily become treasured heritage pieces in your bar collection.A Note on Color: Ebony has a reputation as being pure black, but that’s not how all ebony is. If you watched the video of Bob Taylor (above) shedding light on ebony harvesting practices, you’ll have learned that only about 1 in every 10 ebony trees has a solid black core. The only way to know if an ebony tree was solid black in the middle was to chop down trees until you found one. Rather than continue this grossly unsustainable practice of wasteful harvesting in order to supply ebony consumers with pure black wood, all 10 trees are now harvested and supplied to end users. This means that 1) we won’t run out of ebony, and 2) the ebony that is now used today has color in it.  And it’s beautiful! Swirls and fades of grey and blonde add character and a completely unique aesthetic to each muddler we make. So please embrace this new era of ebony, and celebrate the color of the wood with us!The Aero and Wingman Cocktail SpoonsMissed our first crowdfunding campaign?  These spoons were the result.  The Mixing Glass and Muddlers pair perfectly with these beauties.  You don't have to wait if you want to buy one of these - they are available on our website at www.standardspoon.com, But we do have one Perk that includes both spoons - the Cocktailian Benefactor!The Aero Cocktail Spoon (top) and Wingman Spinning Cocktail Spoon (below)Here's a little description of the spoons; for more details, Visit our Website.Aero Cocktail Spoon: While most straight-handled bar spoons are tacked together with a weak weld and often break, ours is fused into one piece for a seamless design.  Its slim profile is easy to insert around the ice in a mixing glass, and its aerodynamic body is great for near-friction-less stirring (perfect for left-handed use too). The bowl of the spoon holds 1/8 oz of liquid, including the meniscus. The weighted end provides for a beautifully balanced bar spoon, something that feels like a tool, not a toy.Wingman Cocktail Spoon: For bartenders, this spoon requires less hand and wrist motion, improves consistency of dilution (especially when stirring two drinks at once), and decreases the concentration required in a high volume setting. This is a go-to spoon for bartenders dealing with occupational injuries or wrist strain. For the home cocktail enthusiast or beginning bartender, this swivel spoon is the easiest way to stir a drink. The bowl of the spoon holds 1/8 oz of liquid, including the meniscus. Cocobolo MuddlersWait... What?! You may have noticed that the Cocktailian Benefactor Perk includes a special muddler we snuck in for generous backers.  We JUST received a very limited supply of Cocobolo; and we have enough left to make only 5 Muddlers.  Cocobolo is a tropical hardwood from Central America, and is known for its incredible orange and reddish-brown grain.  We'll be turning some of those on the lathe this week and hope to post some finished photos soon, but until then, here's a peek at the raw wood stock we have on hand: Cocktail Club Membership:Standard Spoon isn't some big anonymous brand - we're Rachel Eva and Shawn Michael.  We put ourselves into our brand, and when you get bar tools - you get us.  And Shawn's wry sense of humor. And a thing we call Storytime.When you become a backer of one of our projects, you get access not only to a batch of new tools, but behind-the-scenes details, process photos, moments of inspiration and angst - it's like your own creator-designer-manufacturer reality show. We're even going to go unscripted... LIVE.So if you want to be a part of something real, authentic, and hilarious, it's time to hop on the bus and become a backer. You can be a part of the story by pledging just $7 - that's all it takes to join the club!Production TimelineWe produced our first batch of Ebony Muddlers in December 2016 and shipped them out to early backers who pledged via our Kickstarter Campaign.  As of January 2017, we are upgrading some of our tools to create greater efficiencies in the workshop, and will be back to Ebony Muddler Making this month.  We're fulfilling orders for Ebony Muddlers in the order they are received, and since they are a bit time-intensive (that ebony wood is so dense!), we're estimating a 1-2 month waiting period after you place your order.   We will run out of Ebony stock that's here in San Diego probably mid-2017, and then will have to source it from Cameroon, which will take some time to ship, dry, and make - so order early!  Here's a shot of Shawn in the workshop producing the Ebony Muddlers:Prior to bringing this campaign to you, we found a glass factory overseas, and paid for tooling to have a production sample made, so we would know EXACTLY what we'd be getting.Since we met our first round of funding, we placed our production order with the factory in December, and have word that the factory has begun production! We are checking in with them periodically about Quality Control during this process.  Since Chinese New Year is just around the corner (when all of China effectively shuts down for several weeks to celebrate), we probably won't take delivery of the Mixing Glasses until March or April.  We've set a conservative delivery timeline of May for all Mixing Glasses to allow for an internal quality inspection here in San Diego, and then packaging and getting them all out to those of you who pre-order.  All the photos of the Mixing Glass here, and in the video, are our production samples from the factory!Who We AreWe are Shawn Michael and Rachel Eva, a creative team also known as Work of My Hands. We are artists and designers, and love quality made goods. We've successfully managed three crowdfunding Campaigns: Electricity in Art: Sculptural Lighting (2012),  Standard Spoon for Craft Cocktails (2014), and our just-recently completed initial $10K for this project.You can explore more about our business, our tools, and our approach to projects on our website and blog: standardspoon.com A Note on Processing and Shipping:We offered holiday shipping for Christmas 2016 to the first backers of our project. Now that the holidays have come and gone, Maple and Ebony Muddlers, as well as barspoons will ship as we can get to them after fulfilling orders we've already received. Estimated processing time is 1-4 weeks from placing your order for these items, as some may need to be manufactured on demand during this start-up manufacturing phase.  Thanks for your understanding!",22.0,2,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Keep Your Spices Spicy (Protect &amp; Serve)</h3>
<p>The Five Continent SpicePuck’s <strong>stainless steel base</strong> and <strong>solid top</strong> protect your valuable organic spices from “potency-reducing” light exposure. Let your SpicePucks serve you where you need them instead of keeping them ""far, far away"" in a pantry or a kitchen cabinet.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526003738/ucxogzwdbptrbmvednua.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Blank SpicePuck for your own custom spices and herbs</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>High Quality, Organic Spices &amp; Herbs</h3>
<p>Of course, we will include high quality, organic spices and herbs that will elevate your cooking. Several of our partners and cooperatives source directly from farmers and growers globally to ensure excellent quality. We prioritize suppliers that produce their spices in ways that are good for growers and the planet. Needless to say, the better the spice, the better your results.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1526003979/yj3xw4vvdqjjuhihdq1h.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>For example, the spices used in the cooking video are certified organic and kosher with the rosemary grown in Morocco, the sage in Italy and the cayenne (30,000 HU) in India.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Color-Coded for Easy Identification</h3>
<p>The SpicePuck shaker doors will have six different colors to make the identification of organic spices and herbs easier. For example, most herbs will have green doors (i.e. Basil, Bay Laurel, etc.); Curry, Turmeric, etc. will have a yellow door; Cayenne Pepper, Paprika, etc. will have a red door; Mustard, Sesame, etc. will have a tan door; Nutmeg, Caraway, etc. will have a brown door; Black doors are for your custom spices and seasonings.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Large Volume – More Spice</h3>
<p>It is not obvious, but the SpicePucks are 10-20% bigger than traditional glass containers. We will include more organic spices in the SpicePucks than your average glass bottle can hold.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Democratize Spices</h3>
<p>Tired of paying different prices for different spices? After the campaign, each spice's list price will be $8.99, regardless of the spice type.</p>
<p>And a refill baggie will cost only $5.99, regardless of the spice type. It will be shipped in a protective pouch. It will also contain more spice than the SpicePuck container will hold itself, so you will have a reserve.</p>
<p>Backers will receive each SpicePuck at the discounted price of $6.99, and each Baggie at $4.99 for all of 2018 and 2019.</p>

<p><strong>The Continental European - Erik</strong></p>
<p>Erik used his global business travels to over 60 countries to explore local and unusual food. While Erik attended high school in Berlin, Germany, he worked in a commercial, high-end kitchen, almost convincing himself to become a chef. Ever since he enjoys cooking for friends and family adding dishes and spices from his international travels. His proudest moment was cooking three completely different ducks for a large dinner party.</p>
<p><strong>The British - Neil</strong></p>
<p>Neil left England to discover good food  :-)   He has lived in various locations across the USA, and now resides in Silicon Valley, where he enjoys the wide variety of ethnic dishes on offer. He has also traveled extensively, adding to his exposure to different tastes. His experiences in marketing, engineering, supply chain, and growing new businesses from scratch, are all helping Five Continent Spices.</p>
<p><strong>The East Asian - Dr. Wuby</strong></p>
<p>Having grown up in a suburb of Taiwan, Dr. Wuby prefers delicacies from local eateries and family-style cooking over any fine-dining foods. He prides himself on his lack of Michelin-worthy restaurant experiences and still calls himself a food enthusiast. In his other life, Dr. Wuby is a serial entrepreneur who has over 25 years of experience in product development, e-commerce, web management and inbound marketing strategies. And just for the record, Dr. Wuby makes excellent chicken feet and a killer flan.</p>
<p><strong>The Middle Eastern - Afsaneh</strong></p>
<p>Afsaneh grew up in Persia and always reminisces about home-cooked Persian food and the good old days. She began cooking with her mother when she was 6 and has cooked ever since. After she came to California, she began fusing Persian and Californian cuisine. Afsaneh primarily uses organic ingredients and spices in her creations, most often sourced at local farmers markets. She is in the process of documenting the dishes and recipes passed on by her mother.</p>
<p><strong>The American - Matt</strong></p>
<p>Born and raised in the heart of Silicon Valley, Matt’s love of cooking began in grade school at an early age. From there, he worked his way through high school and college in the restaurant industry starting out as a “shake-boy” at the local Foster’s Freeze and later working in just about every role a restaurant has from busboy to pizza maker, bartender to restaurant manager. With over 15 years experience in working with a wide range of media and channels, he is helping to take Five Continent Spices to the next level.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Campaign</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We have been working hard since 2017 to design our products. We have completed the prototyping phase of the Five Continent SpicePuck and their innovative stand. We even finished low quantity pre-production runs to further test the design, manufacturability, and quality. We already selected the suppliers of organic spices and herbs.</p>
<p>The next steps are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Move the product design into large-scale manufacturing (build high capacity molds and tooling)</li>
<li>Full-scale manufacturing runs of spice containers</li>
<li>Full-scale manufacturing runs of stands</li>
<li>Quality Control and Testing of Manufactured Products</li>
<li>Ship SpicePucks to the US spice warehouse</li>
<li>Assemble, fill, and package SpicePucks</li>
<li>Assemble and package stands</li>
<li>Ship Perks</li>

<h2> </h2>
<h3>FAQ's</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Do you offer refills?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We offer something we call ""baggie."" The protective pouch contains enough spices to fill an existing SpicePuck. In other words, more spices than your regular glass jar.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How much can you fit into a SpicePuck?</strong></p>
<p>We designed the SpicePucks to be about 10-20% bigger than most normal-sized glass containers. Our Refill baggies will contain more spices and herbs than you would get in grocery store glass containers to take advantage of the bigger volume of the SpicePuck.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Can you ship to countries outside of your listed ship-to countries?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Please select shipping to Europe and contact us about shipping to your country.  So far, we have only researched shipping within the US and to Europe since they have an agreement recognizing the organic certification regardless of where it was issued. Other countries may not allow us to call our products organic. Besides, some countries have very restrictive import controls for food items and may consider spice &amp; herbs to fall into that category. So please connect with us, and we will try our best to ship to you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What materials are the SpicePucks made of?</strong></p>
<p>The bottom is food grade stainless steel and the tops are made of food grade polypropylene carbonate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will you offer additional individual spices and herbs after the campaign?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we expect to offer an extensive number of individual spices and herbs after the campaign. We envision to offer the same spice from different locations or different variations (i.e., cayenne pepper comes in a wide range of HU)</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If I want to store the pucks in my cabinet or a drawer, how can I identify the product?</strong></p>
<p>We will ship the initial kits with a self-adhesive sheet that allows you to put the spice name on the side of the puck. That way, you can identify the spice from the side as well. We expect to design custom holders for cabinets and drawers later this year. We will share our designs with you as soon as we have the first prototypes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What is the footprint &amp; height of the stand and will it fit under my wall cabinet?</strong></p>
<p>The Five Continent Spices footprint of the stand is 8.66 inches (220 millimeters) by 8.66 inches (220 millimeters). The height of the Five Continent Spices stand depends on how many platforms are assembled but should not exceed 12.2 inches (310 millimeters) which should allow it to easily fit on the counter under any wall cabinet. We recommend a max of 5 platforms holding 15 SpicePucks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why not include pepper or salt in your kits? </strong></p>
<p>We made a decision not to include salt and pepper for two reasons. The first one is that there are so many different types of peppers and salts out there, it is difficult to select one that will satisfy everyone (black, green, red, white peppers from different countries, regions, and styles – same for salt). The second, more important reason is that we think salt and pepper should be in a grinder (especially pepper) because grinding it to the right size at the right time (i.e., fresh) makes a huge difference. Right now, our SpicePucks do not have grinding capabilities so we felt it would be better not to include them.</p>

</div><p>Thanks for listening. We are excited to bring ""Spices Reimaged"" to people around the world with our Five Continent Spices kits of spices.</p></div>","Spices Reimagined - Organic Spices in Innovative Containers by Five Continent Spices
 
Designed by home-chefs for home-chefs, preserving flavor, shaped for precise use, space minimizing stand, thus ending clutter
 
We are all avid cooks who became frustrated with the mess of our spice cabinets and the poor design of the spice bottles.

 
The Five Continent SpicePuck™ is a better functioning, uniquely shaped spice container with two doors, a stainless steel bottom for durability and to keep spices potent. The hockey puck shape and weight make it feel great in your hand.
The shaker door lets you shake out spices the same way you currently use your glass containers. The large spoon door allows precise and easy access with a measuring spoon. Shake or Spoon - impossible with old-fashioned glass jars. The color of the shaker door lets you easily pick the right spice.

Keep Your Spices Spicy (Protect & Serve)
The Five Continent SpicePuck’s stainless steel base and solid top protect your valuable organic spices from “potency-reducing” light exposure. Let your SpicePucks serve you where you need them instead of keeping them ""far, far away"" in a pantry or a kitchen cabinet.

Blank SpicePuck for your own custom spices and herbs
 
High Quality, Organic Spices & Herbs
Of course, we will include high quality, organic spices and herbs that will elevate your cooking. Several of our partners and cooperatives source directly from farmers and growers globally to ensure excellent quality. We prioritize suppliers that produce their spices in ways that are good for growers and the planet. Needless to say, the better the spice, the better your results.

For example, the spices used in the cooking video are certified organic and kosher with the rosemary grown in Morocco, the sage in Italy and the cayenne (30,000 HU) in India.
 
Color-Coded for Easy Identification
The SpicePuck shaker doors will have six different colors to make the identification of organic spices and herbs easier. For example, most herbs will have green doors (i.e. Basil, Bay Laurel, etc.); Curry, Turmeric, etc. will have a yellow door; Cayenne Pepper, Paprika, etc. will have a red door; Mustard, Sesame, etc. will have a tan door; Nutmeg, Caraway, etc. will have a brown door; Black doors are for your custom spices and seasonings.

 
Large Volume – More Spice
It is not obvious, but the SpicePucks are 10-20% bigger than traditional glass containers. We will include more organic spices in the SpicePucks than your average glass bottle can hold.

 
Sustainable Design
The SpicePuck's stainless steel base and the solid top are made to last. After the campaign, we will offer a cost-effective refill baggie to minimize waste.

 
Democratize Spices
Tired of paying different prices for different spices? After the campaign, each spice's list price will be $8.99, regardless of the spice type.
And a refill baggie will cost only $5.99, regardless of the spice type. It will be shipped in a protective pouch. It will also contain more spice than the SpicePuck container will hold itself, so you will have a reserve.
Backers will receive each SpicePuck at the discounted price of $6.99, and each Baggie at $4.99 for all of 2018 and 2019.
 
Find the Right Spice at the Right Time Right Next to where you Cook.
Tired of storing your spices out of reach and then searching through the current mess? The Five Continent Spices stand makes your spices easy to identify, to access, and to return. The compact design frees-up valuable counter space.

Stand A - ""circular"" counter-top stand

Stand B - ""high density"" stand for counter-top or cabinet
 
No More Clutter
Current spice containers don't work well for cooks and are old fashioned and uninspiring. If you look around your kitchen, almost everything has seen significant design improvements during the last 20 years, except spices are still a mess. SpicePucks in their stand will help eliminate clutter in your kitchen.


 
Countless Engineering Cycles
 
The Five Continent Spices team spent months refining and perfecting the design of the SpicePuck and the stand. We also thought about how to get the finished product packaged for our backers.

 
What People are Saying
 

 
Five Continent Spices Team
 
Spices are part of the culture on all five continents. Our spices originate from all five continents. The founders' experience spans all five continents. 
As a team, we are very experienced in bringing both, new FMCG and technology products, to market. We draw on our passion for food, cooking, entertaining, design, and our real-world experience in engineering, product development, manufacturing, supply chain management, e-commerce, and support.

 
The Continental European - Erik
Erik used his global business travels to over 60 countries to explore local and unusual food. While Erik attended high school in Berlin, Germany, he worked in a commercial, high-end kitchen, almost convincing himself to become a chef. Ever since he enjoys cooking for friends and family adding dishes and spices from his international travels. His proudest moment was cooking three completely different ducks for a large dinner party.
The British - Neil
Neil left England to discover good food  :-)   He has lived in various locations across the USA, and now resides in Silicon Valley, where he enjoys the wide variety of ethnic dishes on offer. He has also traveled extensively, adding to his exposure to different tastes. His experiences in marketing, engineering, supply chain, and growing new businesses from scratch, are all helping Five Continent Spices.
The East Asian - Dr. Wuby
Having grown up in a suburb of Taiwan, Dr. Wuby prefers delicacies from local eateries and family-style cooking over any fine-dining foods. He prides himself on his lack of Michelin-worthy restaurant experiences and still calls himself a food enthusiast. In his other life, Dr. Wuby is a serial entrepreneur who has over 25 years of experience in product development, e-commerce, web management and inbound marketing strategies. And just for the record, Dr. Wuby makes excellent chicken feet and a killer flan.
The Middle Eastern - Afsaneh
Afsaneh grew up in Persia and always reminisces about home-cooked Persian food and the good old days. She began cooking with her mother when she was 6 and has cooked ever since. After she came to California, she began fusing Persian and Californian cuisine. Afsaneh primarily uses organic ingredients and spices in her creations, most often sourced at local farmers markets. She is in the process of documenting the dishes and recipes passed on by her mother.
The American - Matt
Born and raised in the heart of Silicon Valley, Matt’s love of cooking began in grade school at an early age. From there, he worked his way through high school and college in the restaurant industry starting out as a “shake-boy” at the local Foster’s Freeze and later working in just about every role a restaurant has from busboy to pizza maker, bartender to restaurant manager. With over 15 years experience in working with a wide range of media and channels, he is helping to take Five Continent Spices to the next level.
 
Our Campaign
 
We have been working hard since 2017 to design our products. We have completed the prototyping phase of the Five Continent SpicePuck and their innovative stand. We even finished low quantity pre-production runs to further test the design, manufacturability, and quality. We already selected the suppliers of organic spices and herbs.
The next steps are:

Move the product design into large-scale manufacturing (build high capacity molds and tooling)
Full-scale manufacturing runs of spice containers
Full-scale manufacturing runs of stands
Quality Control and Testing of Manufactured Products
Ship SpicePucks to the US spice warehouse
Assemble, fill, and package SpicePucks
Assemble and package stands
Ship Perks

 
Timeline

 
How the funds will be used
 
The funds will be used to pay for our production molds and tooling costs as well as the initial inventory required to assemble and ship the kits to you. We promise frequent updates on our progress, at least monthly, though we hope to be even more frequent. We love blogging and posting on social media, so as a backer you should expect many updates with lots of photos and the occasional video. We've already been previewing photos of our solution on our Facebook and Twitter pages. We'll keep updating those with more info, and we suggest you follow us.
 
Why Crowdfunding?
 
Indiegogo is a proven crowdfunding platform with an avid ""early adopter"" community. We are convinced that this is a great way to tap into the community for feedback and guidance on refining the current products as well as designing our next products. We highly value the Indiegogo community and its role in supporting innovation. We hope that you find the Five Continent Spices idea worthwhile and support us.
 
FAQ's
 
Do you offer refills?
Yes. We offer something we call ""baggie."" The protective pouch contains enough spices to fill an existing SpicePuck. In other words, more spices than your regular glass jar.
 
How much can you fit into a SpicePuck?
We designed the SpicePucks to be about 10-20% bigger than most normal-sized glass containers. Our Refill baggies will contain more spices and herbs than you would get in grocery store glass containers to take advantage of the bigger volume of the SpicePuck.
 
Can you ship to countries outside of your listed ship-to countries?
Yes. Please select shipping to Europe and contact us about shipping to your country.  So far, we have only researched shipping within the US and to Europe since they have an agreement recognizing the organic certification regardless of where it was issued. Other countries may not allow us to call our products organic. Besides, some countries have very restrictive import controls for food items and may consider spice & herbs to fall into that category. So please connect with us, and we will try our best to ship to you.
 
What materials are the SpicePucks made of?
The bottom is food grade stainless steel and the tops are made of food grade polypropylene carbonate.
 
Will you offer additional individual spices and herbs after the campaign?
Yes, we expect to offer an extensive number of individual spices and herbs after the campaign. We envision to offer the same spice from different locations or different variations (i.e., cayenne pepper comes in a wide range of HU)
 
If I want to store the pucks in my cabinet or a drawer, how can I identify the product?
We will ship the initial kits with a self-adhesive sheet that allows you to put the spice name on the side of the puck. That way, you can identify the spice from the side as well. We expect to design custom holders for cabinets and drawers later this year. We will share our designs with you as soon as we have the first prototypes.
 
What is the footprint & height of the stand and will it fit under my wall cabinet?
The Five Continent Spices footprint of the stand is 8.66 inches (220 millimeters) by 8.66 inches (220 millimeters). The height of the Five Continent Spices stand depends on how many platforms are assembled but should not exceed 12.2 inches (310 millimeters) which should allow it to easily fit on the counter under any wall cabinet. We recommend a max of 5 platforms holding 15 SpicePucks.
 
Why not include pepper or salt in your kits? 
We made a decision not to include salt and pepper for two reasons. The first one is that there are so many different types of peppers and salts out there, it is difficult to select one that will satisfy everyone (black, green, red, white peppers from different countries, regions, and styles – same for salt). The second, more important reason is that we think salt and pepper should be in a grinder (especially pepper) because grinding it to the right size at the right time (i.e., fresh) makes a huge difference. Right now, our SpicePucks do not have grinding capabilities so we felt it would be better not to include them.

<h3>Welcome to Skål Beer Hall!</h3>
<p>Before we open our doors this Spring, we are aiming to raise funds to help put the finishing touches on our beer hall and makeup for the series of setbacks and delays we have experienced working through the challenges of an old building in a historic district. Thanks in advance for the support! </p>
<p>Skål (meaning “Cheers” in Norwegian) Beer Hall is our interpretation of a Viking meadhall. The meadhall was the center of the community – a welcoming spot to gather or to host visitors from afar. It was the hall where stories of adventure, exploration, and new ideas were shared and debated over food and drink. It was filled with cheer.</p>
<p>Our great hall will offer a rotating selection of local craft beer, cider, and mead, regional wine, and specialty cocktails (with emphasis on the Scandinavian favorite - aquavit). We’re looking forward to featuring some of our terrific but hard-to-find local products as well as some Scandinavian imports.</p>
<p>The open kitchen – inspired by the idea of a Viking butcher shop – will feature bar bites and shared plates that explore wild flavors from the woods and sea. Imagine (if you will) gathering near a roaring fire at the edge of a fjord. Here is where you’d find our food. There will be Nordic influences, traditional bar snacks, and a whole lot of meat (but meatballs are unlikely, sorry Grandma)! </p>
<p>We don’t take ourselves too seriously and neither should you. Come have a beer or three. Order from our kitchen counter and bar. Chat up your bartender. Play a game. Cozy up to the fire. And invite the whole village.</p>
<p>We will be family friendly (for all our little Vikings out there!) in our front section, 21+ in the back. After 8pm, we'll likely be 21+ only. </p>
<p>We hope to raise a drinking horn and “Skål” together when we open!</p>

<h3>Project Overview:</h3>
<p>InterplanetaryFoods is a startup indoor farming company experimenting in ways to grow food on The Moon and Mars. Our goal with the company is to create more sustainable ways of food production on Earth as well as to develop methods of production for future interplanetary travel. We like to say ""ad astra"" the Latin saying for ""to the stars"" our thinking is that the best way to create sustainable methods here on Earth is to look towards the stars and experiment in the harshest possible conditions. Currently, we're using our custom-developed Martian regolith, the v1.0mars_analog, to study the process of seed germination and food production on mars environment.

<h3>We couldn’t be prouder of the wine we make.</h3>
<p>We are bringing California Wine Country directly to Southern California in a comfortable, no-snobs-allowed tasting room. Our wide-ranging fruit sources will allow our customers to get a virtual tour of California vineyards from Sonoma, to Paso Robles, to Santa Ynez and Santa Rita Hills, all without having to make the drive north to wine country. </p>
<p>Winemaking is all about the grapes. The secret is to get excellent fruit, and then don’t screw it up. So we spend a lot of time and research finding some of the best vineyards from all over California (and our connections from running The Garagiste Festivals certainly don’t hurt). The fruit ain’t cheap, but the quality shows up in the glass. This is the good stuff, and we make it by hand, with love, barrel by barrel.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Unlike breweries, which can get their product to market in a matter of weeks, wineries have a much longer turn-around time - sometimes over two years between harvest and bottling. We are looking to raise $35,000 to help us put the finishing touches on the Tasting Room, get our 2014 and 2015 barrels into the bottle, take care of several unforeseen, expensive problems that our old building has presented us with, not to mention a break-in and theft of all our tools. We've poured our hearts, souls, and bank accounts into this project for years - now it's time get over the finish line.</p>
<p>You will get special wines - only for our supporters, special access, barrel tastings, parties, swag, and get to hang out at the coolest new wine room in Southern California knowing that you helped make it happen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our tasting room will give you a place to relax, hang out and enjoy some wine with us. It will also help spread the growing Garagiste micro-winery movement to SoCal, as well as help us to support local music, art, and causes.</p>
<p>Producing the successful Garagiste Festivals in Paso Robles, Santa Ynez, LA, and the Bay Area for the past six years has given us insight, contacts, experience, and customers far beyond many winery start-ups. We've got a great head start and a heck of a track record - now it's time to get this thing wrapped up, open our doors, and start getting the wine to the people!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Everyday Gourmet started out as a small natural food store supplier with plant based muffins and cookies.  The passion for plant based foods has grown and grown within the company as well as in the industry, so we now want to have our own cafe that includes all of our favorite healthy (and comfort) foods.  Food is love and social, so we want to bring people together to eat delicious, compassionate food in a really great atmosphere.  Continuing our mail orders and wholesale orders will be an ongoing task.  Adding a face to it with a place for people to congregate is just the icing on the cake.....yea that just happened.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The break down:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have a lot of start up costs including cosmetic updates, new sign, equipment for smoothies, waffles, pizza, and ice machine and some other kitchen tools.</li>
<li>We have special perks for our early contributors including discounts on foods and special goody bags.</li>
<li>If we don't reach the goal, the funds will go into reducing our start up costs.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The difference your contribution will make:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your pledge goes beyond your belly!  Plant powered foods are better for the environment, people, animals, and our future.</li>
<li>You will directly influence the menu...the more money we have to start with, the more equipment we can buy to make all of the delicious foods we'd like o offer.</li>
<li>You will immediately be put on our loyalty program that will let you save money every time you come in.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our idea is to get into a turnkey operation with minimal investment. The funds raised from this project will get us a few more pieces of equipment and maybe help with the first month of operations. The goal is to be low risk and high reward for us and the community (meaning planet). More plant based options benefit everyone every where!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, here's what you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.</li>
<li>Do so by using the Indiegogo share tools!</li>
</ul>
</div><p>And that's all there is to it. Yay!</p></div>","Short Summary

<li>Hoppy West Coast favorites such as IPAs and pale ales</li>
<li>Lagers - we love ‘em and think you will too. We’ll have classic light and sessionable lagers, as well as darker lagers like Trevor’s award-winning Schwarzbier</li>
<li>Seasonal beers, like stouts in the winter or a spring saison</li>
<li>Stronger beers such as Imperial Stouts or Belgian Strong ales</li>
<li>Experimental brews which will be fun for us to make and fun for you to try!</li>
</ul><p> </p><h3>The Food</h3><p>When we first open, we’ll offer small snacks in the taproom. You can also bring in your own food, whether it’s from home or takeout/delivery from a local restaurant. We’ll also occasionally have food carts in our beer garden.</p><p>Long-term, we plan to build out our kitchen to offer you a fresh, seasonal, and delicious menu featuring pizzas, salads, and other bites made from as many locally-sourced ingredients as possible.</p><p> </p><h3>The Space</h3><p>Bright natural light fill our taproom and our high ceilings give it a nice open feel. We have seating for about 120 inside at our poured concrete bar, long communal tables, countertops along the front windows, and in our back brick room (which is also be an event space for private tastings and craft nights). A small area is set aside for kids, we're installing an indoor bike rack for about 20 bikes, and our brewing area is visible from inside the taproom. We have a couple TVs for catching your favorite games and outside we have a beer garden for enjoying our awesome San Rafael weather.</p><p> </p><h2>Who are we?</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543637139/ecwmk6jkqabe1edp4wyt.png"" src=""""/></p><p>We’re a husband and wife team who both grew up in Sonoma County but now call San Rafael home. We live about a 10 minute bike-ride from the brewery with our 2.5-yr-old, Jack. We’re so excited to bring our dream to life in the community where we live.</p><p>When we’re not working on the business we try to get outdoors as much as possible. Whether it’s hiking, camping, or cycling, we have a passion for adventure and activity.</p><p>We made a point not to take on partners or investors in order to ensure we’re able to run Pond Farm the way we want to, sticking to our values and never compromising on quality. But, we are really excited to open up crowdfunding because we get to share our business with the most important people to us: you!</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>What We Need</h2><p>We’re aiming to raise at least $30,000, which will go to:</p><ul>
<li>Sound system</li>
<li>Soft-seating area</li>
<li>Indoor bike rack</li>
<li>New sliding windows connecting the taproom to our beer garden outside</li>
<li>Countertop seating along the front windows</li>
</ul><p>If we exceed our goal, we really want to invest in a <a href=""https://www.bonappetit.com/drinks/beer/article/what-is-a-crowler-beer"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Crowler machine</a> so we can send you off with 32oz. of freshly-canned beer right out of the taproom.</p><p>Everyone told us a project like this would take twice as long and cost twice as much as we thought and that’s proven to be true (and then some)! Luckily, we planned for overages.</p><p>However, late in the game we ran into some large and unexpected construction overruns we really didn't have control over. Ouch. This has pulled money away from what we’d set aside for decking out the taproom with the items listed above. We still want to make all of that happen, and that’s why we need your help.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Our Story</h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543639897/qyitul9f11bifpoarmpw.png"" src=""""/></p><p>When we met in San Francisco in 2011, one of the first things we connected over was our shared love of good beer. Hikes and bike rides were almost always followed by a stop for cold beer and then we started homebrewing together. Trevor had been homebrewing for years prior, but with a new eager taster to impress he started brewing more frequently. In every apartment and house we’ve lived in together, we’ve dedicated a significant amount of space to brewing equipment. We even brewed all the beer for our wedding in 2014!</p><p>The idea to open our own brewery and taproom started out as a daydream that we liked to talk about when we were stressed or tired of our day jobs, but slowly we both came to realize this was more than that - it was something we deeply desired and that we felt confident we could turn into a reality.</p><p>The first major step we took was when Trevor left aerospace engineering in 2015 to become an intern at Fogbelt Brewing in Santa Rosa. We wanted to make sure that he still loved brewing as much once it was a job, not just a hobby. He quickly moved up to Assistant Brewer, where he got extensive experience not just in brewing at a commercial scale, but also inventory management, bottling, canning, and sales. He loved it. When we moved to San Rafael in 2016 we thought - yes. This is the place. We need to build our taproom here! We got started on a business plan.</p><p>In early 2017 we came across a listing for the Wooden Duck furniture store building on 4th St. When we walked inside to check it out, we instantly knew it was the right space. Bright, natural light poured through the front windows and skylight and the high ceilings reminded us of a large beer hall. We were thrilled to find that there was an outdoor patio since we’d been hoping for a space that would allow us to take advantage of San Rafael’s fantastic weather. Our offer was accepted in June 2017 and the journey to turn 1848 4th St. into Pond Farm Brewing Co. began.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>The Name</h2><p>Our name is inspired by the former artists’ colony tucked in the hills of Sonoma County in Guerneville called Pond Farm, which not only has a family connection but also embodies our core values of quality, creativity, and community.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543640931/nqwcwjoxgcjusszus6hz.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Pond Farm Workshops began as a school and residency for artists in the 1940s but by the mid-1950s it had converted to Pond Farm Pottery under the direction of Bauhaus potter Marguerite Wildenhain, one of Pond Farm Workshops’ first residents. Marguerite was a renowned potter and known for her passion and discipline for her craft.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543641726/jdoafnqwuz8djf8cvnxv.png"" src=""""/></p><p>In 1973, Trevor’s dad moved from Iowa to California to hone his ceramics skills under the tutelage of Marguerite at Pond Farm. Also living in Guerneville at the time was Trevor’s mom, who grew up in Armstrong Redwoods State Reserve above which Pond Farm was nestled. The two met, got married, and 2 years later Trevor was born and raised in the area nearby, hearing stories of the idyllic Pond Farm and its community of craftsmen and women.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2><p>If a monetary contribution isn’t feasible for you right now, we’d still immensely appreciate your help to spread the word about our project.</p><ul>

And we mean ALL - it's important for brewers to sample the finished goods throughout the process... you know, for motivation and, um, quality control? You each can either choose to come back for a growler from the batch you actually brewed once it's ready, or take home a growler of the beer of your choice that day.

Hoppy West Coast favorites such as IPAs and pale ales
Lagers - we love ‘em and think you will too. We’ll have classic light and sessionable lagers, as well as darker lagers like Trevor’s award-winning Schwarzbier
Seasonal beers, like stouts in the winter or a spring saison
Stronger beers such as Imperial Stouts or Belgian Strong ales
Experimental brews which will be fun for us to make and fun for you to try!
 The FoodWhen we first open, we’ll offer small snacks in the taproom. You can also bring in your own food, whether it’s from home or takeout/delivery from a local restaurant. We’ll also occasionally have food carts in our beer garden.Long-term, we plan to build out our kitchen to offer you a fresh, seasonal, and delicious menu featuring pizzas, salads, and other bites made from as many locally-sourced ingredients as possible. The SpaceBright natural light fill our taproom and our high ceilings give it a nice open feel. We have seating for about 120 inside at our poured concrete bar, long communal tables, countertops along the front windows, and in our back brick room (which is also be an event space for private tastings and craft nights). A small area is set aside for kids, we're installing an indoor bike rack for about 20 bikes, and our brewing area is visible from inside the taproom. We have a couple TVs for catching your favorite games and outside we have a beer garden for enjoying our awesome San Rafael weather. Who are we?We’re a husband and wife team who both grew up in Sonoma County but now call San Rafael home. We live about a 10 minute bike-ride from the brewery with our 2.5-yr-old, Jack. We’re so excited to bring our dream to life in the community where we live.When we’re not working on the business we try to get outdoors as much as possible. Whether it’s hiking, camping, or cycling, we have a passion for adventure and activity.We made a point not to take on partners or investors in order to ensure we’re able to run Pond Farm the way we want to, sticking to our values and never compromising on quality. But, we are really excited to open up crowdfunding because we get to share our business with the most important people to us: you!  What We NeedWe’re aiming to raise at least $30,000, which will go to:
Sound system
Soft-seating area
Indoor bike rack
New sliding windows connecting the taproom to our beer garden outside
Countertop seating along the front windows
If we exceed our goal, we really want to invest in a Crowler machine so we can send you off with 32oz. of freshly-canned beer right out of the taproom.Everyone told us a project like this would take twice as long and cost twice as much as we thought and that’s proven to be true (and then some)! Luckily, we planned for overages.However, late in the game we ran into some large and unexpected construction overruns we really didn't have control over. Ouch. This has pulled money away from what we’d set aside for decking out the taproom with the items listed above. We still want to make all of that happen, and that’s why we need your help.  Our StoryWhen we met in San Francisco in 2011, one of the first things we connected over was our shared love of good beer. Hikes and bike rides were almost always followed by a stop for cold beer and then we started homebrewing together. Trevor had been homebrewing for years prior, but with a new eager taster to impress he started brewing more frequently. In every apartment and house we’ve lived in together, we’ve dedicated a significant amount of space to brewing equipment. We even brewed all the beer for our wedding in 2014!The idea to open our own brewery and taproom started out as a daydream that we liked to talk about when we were stressed or tired of our day jobs, but slowly we both came to realize this was more than that - it was something we deeply desired and that we felt confident we could turn into a reality.The first major step we took was when Trevor left aerospace engineering in 2015 to become an intern at Fogbelt Brewing in Santa Rosa. We wanted to make sure that he still loved brewing as much once it was a job, not just a hobby. He quickly moved up to Assistant Brewer, where he got extensive experience not just in brewing at a commercial scale, but also inventory management, bottling, canning, and sales. He loved it. When we moved to San Rafael in 2016 we thought - yes. This is the place. We need to build our taproom here! We got started on a business plan.In early 2017 we came across a listing for the Wooden Duck furniture store building on 4th St. When we walked inside to check it out, we instantly knew it was the right space. Bright, natural light poured through the front windows and skylight and the high ceilings reminded us of a large beer hall. We were thrilled to find that there was an outdoor patio since we’d been hoping for a space that would allow us to take advantage of San Rafael’s fantastic weather. Our offer was accepted in June 2017 and the journey to turn 1848 4th St. into Pond Farm Brewing Co. began.  The NameOur name is inspired by the former artists’ colony tucked in the hills of Sonoma County in Guerneville called Pond Farm, which not only has a family connection but also embodies our core values of quality, creativity, and community.Pond Farm Workshops began as a school and residency for artists in the 1940s but by the mid-1950s it had converted to Pond Farm Pottery under the direction of Bauhaus potter Marguerite Wildenhain, one of Pond Farm Workshops’ first residents. Marguerite was a renowned potter and known for her passion and discipline for her craft.In 1973, Trevor’s dad moved from Iowa to California to hone his ceramics skills under the tutelage of Marguerite at Pond Farm. Also living in Guerneville at the time was Trevor’s mom, who grew up in Armstrong Redwoods State Reserve above which Pond Farm was nestled. The two met, got married, and 2 years later Trevor was born and raised in the area nearby, hearing stories of the idyllic Pond Farm and its community of craftsmen and women.  Other Ways You Can HelpIf a monetary contribution isn’t feasible for you right now, we’d still immensely appreciate your help to spread the word about our project.

Caffeine-free, low in tannin, Pride of Niassa gives a smooth sweet liquor tasting of apple, honey and clove.Pongo’s Paradise - First Flush DarjeelingA biodynamic first flush Darjeeling from the Selimbong garden. The liquor is the colour of champagne and is delicate, fresh and fruity with a floral fragrance. A classic spring harvest black tea from the first certified biodynamic tea garden in the region. Expect golden raisin, white grape and notes of lily.Credits: Top photos -  Les Jardins de GaïaBottom photos - Anette Kay – Satemwa (Malawi) Our partnersOur profits help to fund the work of four projects on the frontline of conservation. Each has a different focus and approach. Each has been chosen for its impact and effectiveness.Sangha Pangolin ProjectCentral African RepublicPangolins are a shy, scaly anteater found across Asia and Africa. Despite being protected under international law, pangolins are poached for bush meat and for their scales which are used in traditional Asian medicine. These reclusive and gentle mammals are now considered the most trafficked wild animal in the world.At Sangha Pangolin Project, Rod and Tamar Cassidy and their team, rehabilitate injured and confiscated pangolins before ‘soft release’ back into the wild. They also run research and monitoring programmes with local Ba’aka trackers to learn more about pangolin behaviour and ecology. Lwiro Primate Rehabilitation CentreDemocratic Republic of CongoLwiro Primate Rehabilitation Centre is a true lifeline for our closest cousins - the great apes. Lwiro provides sanctuary for orphaned chimps and monkeys whose parents have been killed by poachers for bushmeat. Orphans are found alone in the wild or confiscated from the illegal pet trade.Once rescued, Itsaso Guinea and her team of expert vets and keepers, rehabilitate these traumatised orphans. They learn again to laugh, to play and to be part of a new family, so that one day they may be released back into the wild. Niassa Carnivore ProjectMozambiqueLions face many threats from human conflict across Africa. Along with other large carnivores (leopards, African wild dogs, hyaenas) they are snared for bushmeat and illegally hunted for their bones, teeth and claws which are sold as trinkets in Asia. The Niassa National Reserve is home to over 1000 lions, 44 villages and the Niassa Carnivore Project which works to help these lions and local communities co-exist sustainably. Their holistic approach puts equal emphasis on effective anti-poaching and effective long-term community development to increase income, food security and education. Aaron ‘Bertie’ GekoskiUKAaron Gekoski is an award-winning environmental photojournalist, film-maker and TV presenter, specialising in human-animal conflict.Aaron's work regularly appears in the international press and has won numerous awards including the coveted Wildlife Photographer of the Year and Nature Photographer of the Year. Aaron has spent years documenting animals in captivity and his latest documentary exposes orangutan tourism.  How will we use the funds raised?The funds we raise will make up the first set of orders for animalltea ,  putting us on the path to our full launch in January 2021. Funds will cover the dispatch of orders and replacement stock. They will also be used to help create our new website, and invest in better packaging for retail.What do I get and when?Our perks include both teas and tea tastings. All tea orders will be shipped on December 18th 2020 but we can't guarantee they will be delivered on time for Christmas. Check them out here:   Connect and share. Please follow us on Facebook & Instagram for news on our projects and teas.Sharing this campaign with your network is so important to us.

Recent books like the 5-volume 'Modernist Bread' are an indication of how complex and wonderful the science of bread can be. We have worked hard to translate the best of the bread science into LoafNest to make it simple to use, to deliver consistent results, tolerant for errors in recipes, versatile for various types of breads, and to make beautiful and tasty bread for everyday use. Here is the science behind how we do it.</p><p><strong>Hydration</strong>: the proportion of liquids in a recipe has a strong influence on the structure of the bread. This ratio is called hydration and typically expressed as a weight percent of flour in the recipe. For example, a 50% hydration recipe has 50 grams of water for every 100 grams of flour. Too low a hydration makes the bread end up dry and tough. Higher hydration is generally preferred for and high hydration breads (e.g. ciabatta) are known for their rich soft texture and taste. However, too high a hydration typically makes softer bread but after a point it causes the bread structure to collapse which makes a very dense bread. Of course, it also makes it very difficult to handle since the dough would be very runny. Only with a very strong protein structure can a high hydration bread hold its structure during baking. You can achieve this by adding flour strengthening agents (as done in many commercial bakeries) or by allowing more time for the protein structure to develop. With LoafNest, we recommend the long fermentation and slow yeast activity process to allow for the proteins to hydrolyze to a higher extent, to form stronger and longer chains that can help bread retain its structure even with high hydration, which is typically used in no knead methods. With the silicone liner to hold the dough during the baking, it makes it even easier.</p><p><strong>Crust formation</strong>: Crust forms on the bread when the outer layer reaches a high temperature and goes through changes like Caramelization and Millard reactions. This creates the wonderful golden-brown color and the flavor. The texture of the crust comes from the gelling of starch on the surface as it hardens. A higher humidity of air around the bread as it is baking does not let the bread surface dry as it bakes. This gives a thin but crunchy crust that we associate with artisanal breads. LoafNest retains the moisture inside by forming a seal on the rim using the silicone liner while thick walls of cast iron provide high heat to the bread. This very effective moisture trapping allows for crunchy and thin crust.</p><p><strong>Consistent baking temperature</strong>: Unknown to most home bakers, the temperature you set on your own is not necessarily the temperature experienced by the bread. We are not talking about inaccuracies in temperature setting. Even an oven with perfectly calibrated temperature will not ensure a consistency of temperature for bread baking simply due to the variation of humidity in atmosphere. Ever noticed how on a humid day you feel warmer with the same temperature that is fine on a dry day? The same thing happens to the bread. If the air is dry it experiences a lower temperature than that of air temperature. In thermodynamics this is called the wet bulb temperature. Since LoafNest seals moisture around the bread, the air will become quickly saturated with moisture and hence your bread will always experience the same temperature that you intend.</p><p><strong>Oven spring</strong>: The large cracks on the surface of the bread (called ears/ oven spring) are distinguishing feature on many artisanal bread. On some breads like baguettes they are distinct part of the identity of the bread. Location and number of these ears is controlled on some breads by scoring with sharp a knife. These ears are formed when the outer layer of bread is partly hardened but inner of the bread is still expanding. This expansion of bread is called oven spring. When oven spring happens at the beginning of the baking before the outer layer is fully hardened, it can lead to wonderful ears. But oven spring requires a lot of heat input into the bread and most ovens can not provide heat fast enough. With specifically designed high thermal mass of cast iron casserole, LoafNest re-creates condition similar to a stone oven. This gives a great oven spring every time.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522256046/kipmoyf32n5jxctkzj7t.png"" src=""""/></p></div>","6 Steps to Perfect Artisan BreadConvenienceUsing the LoafNest is so easy and practical.

On some breads like baguettes they are distinct part of the identity of the bread. Location and number of these ears is controlled on some breads by scoring with sharp a knife. These ears are formed when the outer layer of bread is partly hardened but inner of the bread is still expanding. This expansion of bread is called oven spring. When oven spring happens at the beginning of the baking before the outer layer is fully hardened, it can lead to wonderful ears. But oven spring requires a lot of heat input into the bread and most ovens can not provide heat fast enough. With specifically designed high thermal mass of cast iron casserole, LoafNest re-creates condition similar to a stone oven. This gives a great oven spring every time.",30.0,0,"1 Campaign

  Not only does it taste AMAZING, OneForNeptune’s Sea Jerky is GOOD FOR YOU too!  With OFN Pacific rockfish jerky, you’ll get more protein per pound than salmon, beef, or chicken. Pacific rockfish has 30-100x more Omega-3s than beef and even double the Omega-3s of Atlantic Cod!OneForNeptune’s Sea Jerky is also rich in Selenium, Vitamin D, and Vitamin E, making it great for boosting your heart health, strengthening your immune system, supporting stronger bones, healthier skin, and improving brain function and cognitive performance. 
  
 Photo Courtesy of Connor Gallagher ProductionsThe Rockfish is a little known rockstar of the US West Coast. The name ‘Pacific rockfish’ describes a family of abundant, sustainably-managed species common from Southern California to the Pacific Northwest and Alaska. We use this amazing wild-caught fish to make our delicious jerky.  Despite the fact that they are an absurdly rich source of high-quality, sustainable protein, rockfish are currently an undervalued and underutilized fish. After being depleted through poor management and overfishing in the 1980’s and 1990’s, populations have rebounded, fishermen are catching rockfish, but consumer interest hasn’t bounced back for this noble fish. In fact, only 24% of the scientifically-based West Coast quota for Pacific rockfish is caught. 
  Our Pacific rockfish is packed with protein and Omega-3 healthy fats, while surprisingly low in calories per gram. In fact, it has roughly ¼ the calories per gram compared to ground beef! It also has zero saturated fat and 2x the Omega-3 content of Atlantic cod!  Not only that, but Pacific rockfish is also a good source of Selenium, Vitamin D, and Vitamin E - making it an amazing and delicious superfood for any occasion.  
 
  Rockfish has almost 12x more Omega-3s than Chicken, and almost 2x more than Atlantic Cod and Tilapia.  Rockfish has 50x more Vitamin D than ground beef, 30x more than chicken, and 4.2x more than Atlantic cod.  Rockfish has 6x more Vitamin E than turkey, 1.5x more than chicken, and 2x more than ground beef.  Rockfish has 4x more Selenium than Chicken, beef, and farmed salmon. It also has 2x more Selenium than Atlantic cod and wild salmon.  Our Pacific rockfish is packed with lean protein with next to zero saturated fat. Even better, rockfish contains ⅓ the calories per gram compared to ground lean beef. You would be hard pressed to find a better protein-to-calorie ratio.In fact, 100g of Pacific rockfish contains only 90 calories, of which 82% are derived directly from protein! Compare that to the 332 calories per 100g of ground beef, 186 calories per 100g of chicken, and 119 calories per 100g of lean turkey breast. 
 
 
 
  OneForNeptune’s Sea Jerky is not just high in protein, one packet contains 100% of the broadly accepted daily recommendation for healthy Omega-3 fatty acids as well (250-500mg). In 100g of Pacific rockfish, there is up to 350 mg of Omega-3. That’s DOUBLE the amount found in Atlantic cod, 4x the amount in Tilapia, 12x chicken, and 30-100x that of beef!  Omega-3 fatty acids are well-known to be great for improving your heart health and preventing heart disease. It’s been shown to lower elevated triglyceride levels - which has been shown to decrease your risk for heart disease. Experts also recommend eating whole food/real seafood rather than supplements to get your Omega-3 intake. Studies suggest that Omega-3s from whole food sources were better absorbed into our bodies than Omega-3s from supplements.There have also been studies showing Omega-3s can help with joint pain and rheumatoid arthritis, depression, vision loss, as well as infant health & neurodevelopment. Some studies also cite a reduced risk in cognitive decline, Alzheimer’s disease, and dementia, as well as a reduced risk of cancer, with higher Omega-3 intake.A recent study also found that children who reported eating fish weekly scored 4.8 points higher on IQ exams as compared to those who didn’t.  Along with Omega-3s, our jerky is also packed with Vitamin D & E.Vitamin D & E are proven to be vital for skin and bone development and to help build a stronger immune system. Along with getting a healthier body, these vitamins can also help improve brain function and cognitive performance.   Needless to say, OneForNeptune’s Sea Jerky makes a super-snack for body-hacking and overall health.   Our Pacific rockfish is also a great source of Selenium. In fact, rockfish has more Selenium than almost any other animal protein.  Selenium is an antioxidant that helps prevent coronary heart disease, fights inflammation, and increases blood flow.  Some recent studies also that suggest Selenium may reduce the likelihood of certain cancers, These studies are so far inconclusive but this remains an exciting, growing area of research.And let’s not forget that rockfish, as mentioned, contains almost zero saturated fat. All hail the mighty, heart-healthy rockfish!  We took extreme care in selecting every ingredient in OneForNeptune’s Sea Jerky. All of our products are non-GMO, gluten-free, and nitrate/preservative free making it the perfect snack for anyone on a ketogenic diet or paleo lifestyle. For those avoiding meat, now you can eat jerky while maintaining a Pescatarian diet.We also made sure that our products are kosher, free of dairy, nut free so as many people as possible can enjoy it!  
  Sustainability is why we embarked on this journey and it is at the core of our mission, vision, and future. All of the fish we source are 100% U.S. wild-caught Pacific rockfish. We make sure that every single fish comes from a sustainably managed fishery certified by the leading international sustainable seafood ecolabel and that the species and gear types are “Best Choice"". We have made efforts to align ourselves with a network of hardworking, dependable, small-scale fishers who buy into OneForNeptune’s driving mission.  We believe that it is critically important that you know all about the fish you’re buying, as well as where and by whom  it was caught. With our “Find My Fish” platform, you can scan the QR code found on the back of each OneForNeptune package, where you will find all of this information and learn more about the global seafood trade.  
 
  Paying homage to the Vikings who sailed to distant lands with dried fish in their Longboats, our Original flavor blends smoky sea salt with cracked pepper and gin-soaked juniper berries, leaving your mouth watering for more. Created in our founder’s kitchen in, New Mexico, OneForNeptune started with a dream and countless hours of trial and error.  Excited for new adventures and flavors ahead, Norse Smoke will forever be our foundation in creating a bluer future for our oceans.  Our fiery blend of Cajun spices invigorates the taste buds of adventure seekers on the trail, cliff face, open water.  Inspired by Creole chefs from the Louisiana Bayou, who have a long-lasting tradition of bold, rich dishes, or spice combinations of cayenne, paprika, garlic, thyme, salt, and peppers are truly something special. This mouthwatering blend will get you hooked. Don’t forget to share!  Balancing zesty lemon, smooth honey, and crisp, refreshing ginger, our HLG flavor will elicit an involuntary “mmmmMmmm” as the blend of sweet and savory hits your palette. This one is a favorite of snackers young and old and is an excellent complement to a cheese plate or packed lunch on a spring picnic or afternoon sail.

This is food that can even be produced without the use of freshwater or agricultural products, in the case of responsible, wild-caught seafood. At the same time, about 80-90% of Americans do not meet dietary recommendations for seafood consumption. We at OneForNeptune want to change that and make it easier for you to enjoy the best that the ocean has to offer.  We are embarking on this journey to change the perception of seafood in this country and make it easy and delicious for people to enjoy the amazing benefits of seafood anywhere they go. Not only can you feel good about the nutrition of what you’re putting into your body, but you can also feel good about the impact you’re having on our planet.  When you choose OneForNeptune, you are supporting U.S. jobs while taking care of Mother ocean, one bite at a time.The ocean is our most valuable resource. We want to use food as part of the solution for our Blue Planet. Together, we can keep our oceans vibrant and pass on their bounty to future generations. 
 
   Nick wishes he'd been born with gills but does his best to live a seafaring existence without ‘em. Claiming both San Diego, CA and his family ranch in the Gila Wilderness of New Mexico as home, he was raised with an innate respect for land & sea, their preservation being of the utmost importance. Before taking the helm at OneForNeptune, Nick worked in sustainable aquaculture research and marine science in eight countries, which included tagging sharks and tuna at sea, and several trans-Pacific sailing voyages. Deep in Nick’s heart, you’ll find a commitment to sustainable seas, healthier, more delicious food, and disruptive change, which are guiding tenets of OneForNeptune. When he’s not in the Captain’s quarters, you’ll find Nick deep underwater chasing fish and abalone or off-trail in the backcountry of New Mexico (depending on whether it’s a surf or turf time of the year). James is an Englishman by heart and avid adventurer. Sailing since an early age he developed a fondness for the open waters of the seas. Before James celebrated his 20th birthday, he successfully established, developed, and sold his first business.  His desire for more pushed him to pursue his studies at the University of Loughborough. In 2010 he set up a luxury eCommerce company which has allowed him to travel extensively, picking up the important marketing, negotiation, buying, selling, and operational skills required for business. James is a foodie with a passion for travel. He loves efficiency and smooth operations. In his downtime, he's often found very close to or on the water. Financial, legal, and contract expert. After studying Economics at Stanford University, Garrett went to work a for a Southern California based commercial real estate corporation, rising to become CFO of the $640M company in four years. He moved on from this role in hopes of generating greater social and environmental impact through his work and found OneForNeptune. Hailing from the Palos Verdes Peninsula, a Los Angeles coastal suburb, Garrett developed a love for the sea inspecting the tide pools of Abalone Cove and making his fondest memories on the sunny, sandy, Southern California beaches with his family.  We love the ocean. We love diving its depths, surfing its waves, admiring its perfect creatures, and pondering its countless mysteries. The ocean is our greatest resource, and we want to be a part of the solution. Join us - so future generations have the opportunity to enjoy all that the ocean has to offer. 
 Since starting OneForNeptune, we have grown leaps and bounds.  We’ve brainstormed, we’ve researched, we’ve pitched, and even won an internationally acclaimed prize. We have the right team and the pieces in place to make our dream a reality, but we need your help.  With your support, OneForNeptune can begin production to launch our first three flavors. Any additional funds will be used to grow our partnerships with small-scale fishermen and to further our educational outreach so everyone can be a part of our mission. Join our crew and you will be the very first to receive our jerky and the many other treasures we have to offer.  You can help us accomplish our goals so together we can be a part of a healthy, sustainable, and delicious future, for you, me, and the sea.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is Charlie Sizemore. I've been working in Burlington restaurants and bars for the past 15 years--running Taco Gordo for the past four. Many of you are familiar with the business, if not please check out our <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/TacoGordoVT/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a>,  <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/tacogordovt/?hl=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a> and <a href=""http://www.tacogordovt.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Website</a>.</p>
<p>We're taking Taco Gordo off the streets and into the old Burlington Beverage and Redemption Center space in the Old North End of Burlington. Full bar, 50+ seats, outdoor seating, and all our tortillas being made fresh by our neighbors in the space, All Souls Tortilleria.</p>
<p>My vision is to build Taco Gordo into a Burlington institution. To bring warmth in the winter and fun in the summer. For years from now, for the smells and sounds of the space to remind people of childhood, of their college years, of time spent with friends.</p>
<p>It's a huge project. We're renovating and fitting the space up from nothing. I'm looking to raise $20,000 to help with fit-up of the space, start-up costs, and to buy equipment. Any level of support is appreciated. We've come up with some awesome incentives for those willing to donate, please check them out. And if you can't help with a donation, please consider sharing this campaign and spreading the word.</p>
<p>I love you all, and am endlessly grateful for all the support you've shown us to this point. Can't wait to see you at the new spot in September.</p>

<h3>Veg'n Out Cafe</h3>
<p>I am Lucas deWindt. I am working with Derek Wytzka to open a Vegetarian and Vegan Cafe and Bakery in North East Ohio. We both have backgrounds in the food business and we would like our chance to open our own restaurant rather than work for another one.</p>
<p>We really want to open this cafe because, being both vegetarians, we don't have many options when dining out. We can choose from salads, meatless pasta/pizza, or <em>sometimes</em> a veggie burger. With the help of your donations, we will be able to open a place that ANYONE can eat at. We are not going to supply strange vegetarian options that no one will eat, but options that everyone can enjoy and that you would never expect to be vegetarian.</p>
<p>We ultimately want to succeed and open cafe's all around the country to offer such a varitey of <strong>healthy </strong>options to everyone. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We can't start this business without your help! To get a running start on the <em>Veg'n Out Cafe</em>, we are looking to raise a minimum of $30,000. It may seem like a lot, but with this money we will be able to advance tremendously!</p>
<p>With your donations, we will acquire:</p>
<ul>
<li>A building to open the cafe. </li>
<li>Supplies including things such as ovens, refrigerators/freezers, baking/cooking equipment, mixers, kitchen utensils, tables, etc.</li>
<li>Advertisement: website, business cards, apparel, merchandise that will be rewarded, commercial space, billboard/sign space. </li>
<li>As well as the acquistion of a staff.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have quite a set of uniqe perks. You can get a perk with as little as just $1 or as much as $5,000+. Some of the perks include: Veg'n Out Cafe merchandise, thank-you notes and plaques, discount rates for every visit you make, and <em>menu items named</em> <strong>and </strong><em>created by YOU!</em> </p>
<p>If we unfortunately do not reach our goal, our hope is not gone. We will put the money received towards opening an at home/online vegan bakery. We will have a website filled with our menu and all you will have to do is order online and we will ship it directly to you... FRESHNESS GUARANTEED! If this is the case, the money will be put towards ingredients needs, shipping costs, and baking supplies: stand mixers, larger oven, proper decorating tools. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How Even a Dollar From You Can Change Our Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Veg'n Out Cafe will be a valuable investment to everyone who takes part in it. In today's society, fast food chains rule the food world. They serve unhealthy, greasy, and sometimes underprepared food that doesn't satisfy our nutritional needs. Fast food makes it easier to eat because it is much cheaper than buying healthy organic foods, but with Veg'n Out Cafe, everything will be much healthier than fried foods, and best of all, the prices will mirror the cheap foods rather than the expensive items at a grocery store. </p>
<p>Not only will our food be for vegetarians and vegans, but our food will appeal to everyone who enjoys healthier eating without breaking the bank. I am probably one of the biggest offenders of purchasing fast food rather than healthy food due to economic issues. In today's economy, we all struggle with money and food is a neccesity. So we want to open a cafe where the prices are the same as McDonald's or Wendy's, but offer those healthier options that we are all missing out on. </p>
<p>We will supply you a healthy and relaxing enviroment fit for anyone's hectic lifestyle. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Most of you may not be able to donate, but that's alright! We have other ways you can help us out...</p>
<ul>
<li>We ask you to make some noise and spread the word and mission of Veg'n Out Cafe to everyone you know!</li>
<li>You can like us on Facebook, tweet us on Twitter, email us, and repin us on Pinterest!</li>

<p><strong>ABOUT US:</strong><br/>The Apothecary Bitters Company is a small batch cocktail bitters company in Vancouver, BC and has remained one of the top selling brands in Canada over our 5+ years of operation. Our products are also sold in the US and Australia. Over the course of our time running we’ve received a generous amount of press coverage as well as several accolades and awards.</p>
<p>Our unique and complex bitters, formulated to enhance spirits and cocktails, are handmade using only the finest natural botanicals.</p>
<p>We believe that bitters should be a complex blend of flavors and aromas, not one dimensional or single flavored, to add layers of depth and flavor to your cocktails, sodas and cooking. As such, our bitters are currently used at top bars across Canada and at select bars in the US and abroad. </p>
<p>Our founder and head bitters maker, Cole Benoit, is also a beverage industry consultant. He works closely with the award winning distillery, Long Table Distillery, on their cocktail program and products, such as BC's first (and gold winning) amaro, an orange curacao, an absinthe (in which he grew most of the botanicals), a unique rum (still aging) and more.<br/>He is also an educator and tour guide, having taught seminars across Canada in a variety of settings on topics such as bitters, cocktails, spirits and using botanicals.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>CAMPAIGN INFORMATION:</strong><br/>With this campaign we plan to release up to five limited edition bitters flavors that will only be available through the IndieGoGo campaign.<br/><br/>We are constantly creating new flavors and have come up with some we absolutely love and want to share with the world, however we also feel that a brand can extend their product line too much, which can cause stress on retailers and overwhelm consumers, therefore we wanted to do an IndieGoGo campaign to make these flavors available to bartenders and consumers, both new and existing, without complicating our current retail line up and distribution.</p>
<p>We’re offering three initial flavors with this campaign with two unlockable stretch goal flavors. The initial flavors are: Solar Flare - Herbal Kola bitters, Bird of Paradise - Tropical Tiki bitters and Forgotten Trails - Winter Forest bitters.<br/><br/>The first stretch goal flavor, Winds of the Mojave - Desert Sage bitters, will be available at $2500 and the second, Pythia’s Temple - Savory Garden bitters, will be available at $3500.<br/><br/>By purchasing through this IndieGoGo campaign you will have access to limited edition bitters not available for retail sale anywhere! They will be exclusive to our IndieGoGo supporters.</p> <p><strong>WHAT WE NEED:</strong><br/>The minimum funding we require will allow us to purchase the materials and ingredients needed to produce the limited bitters lineup.<br/><br/>Most of the ingredients used in these limited bitters flavors aren’t used in our core flavors, therefore we need funds to purchase all of these special ingredients. Due to the small scale production of these bitters, the cost of materials (such as labels) goes up and increases the cost of each bottle.<br/><br/>Any excess funds will go towards re-investing in The Apothecary Bitters Company to help with equipment upgrades, educational seminars for consumers, promotional materials, infrastructure and all of the other expenses involved in maintaining and growing a small business.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE PERKS:</strong></p>
<p>The perks here are of course the limited edition bitters flavors you will receive! Exclusive to this IndieGoGo campaign, you’ll be purchasing unique and delicious bitters that will not be available again.</p>
<p>As well, the first 20 people to purchase the 5 bottle tier will receive a 1 oz bottle of super unique mystery bitters, also exclusive to the campaign.<br/><br/>Our last tier will allow 10 people to receive all 5 flavors PLUS 3 bottles of a completely custom* flavor of their choosing that we will design and produce just for them! <br/>*(Restrictions apply on the cost/availability of ingredients and the theme of the flavor.)</p>

<p><strong>WHY WE CAN MAKE THIS WORK:</strong><br/>As mentioned, we’ve been successfully producing cocktail bitters on a commercial scale for over 5 years now, with cross Canada distribution and self distribution in the US and Australia. We understand the intricacies of bitters production, manufacturing and packaging.<br/><br/>We also have been working with bars and bartenders over that entire time, with excellent feedback, ensuring that these bitters will work amazingly in either a home or professional bar setting. </p>
<p>Also, we initially launched The Apothecary Bitters Company with a Kickstarter campaign so we’ve done this before in terms of managing the campaign, fulfilling rewards and all of the logistics involved with production and especially shipping.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES:</strong><br/>We’ve already extensively tested these flavors over the past few years and are confident in their flavor profiles and usability in cocktails, cooking and more.<br/><br/>Since these flavors are merely an extension of our current production methods, there is very little in the way of risk for those donating to the campaign. We’ve been producing bitters successfully on a commercial level for over 5 years now and having done a number of seasonal flavors over the years, we also understand the intricacies of scaling up bitters recipes for commercial production.<br/><br/>As well, because we did a Kickstarter for our initial conception almost 6 years ago we have experience with the logistics, shipping/delivery and reward fulfillment involved in a fundraising campaign.</p>
<p>Procuring materials and ingredients in a timely manner can always be a challenging aspect of an operation like ours but we’re confident in our relationships with our suppliers and that we can produce these bitters on schedule.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP:</strong><br/>Not everybody can afford to purchase bitters or donate, nor is everyone interested in purchasing bitters for themselves, but we’re sure you know someone who might like to try our unique and delicious limited edition flavors, so please help us share this campaign, be it on social media or in person!<br/><br/>You can find us at <a href=""http://www.apothecarybitters.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.apothecarybitters.com</a> or on Facebook (The Apothecary Bitters Company) or on Instagram (@apothecarybitters).</p>

Procuring materials and ingredients in a timely manner can always be a challenging aspect of an operation like ours but we’re confident in our relationships with our suppliers and that we can produce these bitters on schedule. 
OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP:Not everybody can afford to purchase bitters or donate, nor is everyone interested in purchasing bitters for themselves, but we’re sure you know someone who might like to try our unique and delicious limited edition flavors, so please help us share this campaign, be it on social media or in person!You can find us at www.apothecarybitters.com or on Facebook (The Apothecary Bitters Company) or on Instagram (@apothecarybitters).
You can also use the IndieGoGo sharing tools to help spread the word as well.
We truly appreciate any and all of your support - it means the world to us!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Mimi Grace: Coffee/Tea/Clean Eats</h3>
<p>Mimi Grace: Coffee/Tea/Clean Eats is a local Redding, CA business opening a shop in August 2017 featuring specialty drinks and farm to table style eats from local sources whenever possible. </p>
<ul>
<li>Mimi Grace started at the Redding Farmer's Market two years ago with specialty coffees and gluten free waffles. While creating community through good food and drink has always been in our vision; getting to know the local farming community expanded our vision to see how opening a shop could support and grow the local economy. By showcasing how delicious local ingredients are and sourcing from local artisans, Mimi Grace is not just a coffee shop, but a catalyst for local economy and other aspiring entrepreneurs. </li>
<li>Having chosen a location and gotten permits from the city, we are now in the midst of completing renovations. During this process we are choosing to create a space that is done well and serves with excellence. As the opening date approaches, we want to invite you to be a part of creating this space and making it possible. </li>
<li>Redding is special in that it is the largest town in northern CA and is right off the I5 corridor. We consistently have a large number of visitors in our city from all over the world. However there seems to be a gap in the farm to table, healthy cafe options in our city. By contributing to the opening of Mimi Grace, you are helping to create a place that not only supports our local farmers but also where you can enjoy healthy real food and tasty beverages. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need equipment, final construction, and furniture:</p>
<ul>

Mimi Grace: Coffee/Tea/Clean Eats is a local Redding, CA business opening a shop in August 2017 featuring specialty drinks and farm to table style eats from local sources whenever possible. 

Mimi Grace started at the Redding Farmer's Market two years ago with specialty coffees and gluten free waffles. While creating community through good food and drink has always been in our vision; getting to know the local farming community expanded our vision to see how opening a shop could support and grow the local economy. By showcasing how delicious local ingredients are and sourcing from local artisans, Mimi Grace is not just a coffee shop, but a catalyst for local economy and other aspiring entrepreneurs. 
Having chosen a location and gotten permits from the city, we are now in the midst of completing renovations. During this process we are choosing to create a space that is done well and serves with excellence. As the opening date approaches, we want to invite you to be a part of creating this space and making it possible. 
Redding is special in that it is the largest town in northern CA and is right off the I5 corridor. We consistently have a large number of visitors in our city from all over the world. However there seems to be a gap in the farm to table, healthy cafe options in our city. By contributing to the opening of Mimi Grace, you are helping to create a place that not only supports our local farmers but also where you can enjoy healthy real food and tasty beverages.

The exquisite aroma and vision of the coffee oils floating to the top makes coffee aficionados the world over prefer to press and pour.Nevertheless, many coffee drinkers have set their French press aside to avoid the mess that comes with cleaning. It consumes more time, smudges your sink, clogs your drain and requires a lot of tap water or kitchen paper to clean up the presses' messes.With your support, we can solve the problem once and forever. We’re giving you back your French press pleasure without any of the pain. 

 
Say hello to GRUMS - a brilliantly simple “cup” that collects your grounds for easy disposal while keeping your carafe clean. We’re developing the ideal receptacle for your grounds that automatically fastens to the plunger when you pull it from the carafe to empty and clean it. GRUMS saves you time, effort, water, and eliminates clogging of your drain. Just shake your grounds out from the cup to your trash bin or save the grounds for a variety of helpful uses (more on that later). You’ve just made a nice cup of coffee from your French press, and now your carafe is filled with coffee grounds. Time for clean up! The coffee grounds are thrown into the sink and now you rinse the carafe and the sink with lots of water. Wasteful and messy! With GRUMS, you simply add your fresh coffee grounds into the GRUMS cup, set it inside the carafe, fill with water, and press down the plunger.Now comes the magic.After you’ve enjoyed your delicious cup of coffee, gently push the plunger in the GRUMS cup and let friction work for you to effortlessly pull out the grounds – compacted nice and tidy inside the GRUMS cup. After lifting the cup out, all the grounds can be thrown into the trashcan, or set aside for other meaningful uses.   We set out to create something so smart, simple and easy, French press coffee lovers wouldn’t think twice about purchasing one.With GRUMS, you get the taste you want without the mess you don’t. Just fill up GRUMS with your favorite coffee until you reach one of the markings of your liking. Place the cup into the French press, pour your hot water, press, and then enjoy a nice cup of coffee. Afterwards, the plunger is automatically fastened to the cup, which easily can now be removed to throw out the grounds or even keep it for later purposes – How simple is that? In Denmark, where GRUMS is being developed, we are passionate about conserving resources to benefit people and our planet. Much of our inspiration for GRUMS is a result of not wanting to waste water. On average, it takes about 4-liters (more than a gallon) to clean your carafe and sink – even more if your drain clogs.Lets say we put it conservatively at 2 liters minimum to clean you carafe after use. Taking into account the number of French presses sold up to now, and the average use (1-2 times a week), we get to a stunning water consumption of 104.000.000 cubic meters (27,473,893,445 gal) pr. year. That’s enough to fill about 7 million tanker trucks. The length of all these trucks combined equals to more than two times the circumference of the Earth.Let us remind our selves that only 1% of the world’s water is fresh water, and this water needs to be made drinkable before it comes out of our taps. The energy required to make water drinkable is substantial. By using water to clean a carafe with coffee grounds, we’re wasting the world’s precious supplies of water.USING GRUMS can save 100,000 tons of CO2.This is the energy it approximately takes to collect, pump, distribute and again drain off all this water. According to the Danish Danva water association it takes about 1 kg CO2 per 1000 liters. So we use not only a lot of water but also 100,000 tons of CO2 to deal with it. Lets save this too. GRUMS is not made for any specific French Press brand, but for the standard 1-liter jar that is most commonly used. GRUMS will fit right into what we believe is more than 95% of French press carafes being sold today and at least all the major brands.If you're concerned about fit, take a measure at home before you pledge.The outer dimension of GRUMS is 90 mm (3.5-inches), so your carafe should be a little larger than that. Save the grounds and re-use them – Coffee grounds can be used for more than 20 different purposes including surprising things, like fungus and soap making.Brewing coffee is actually using a small percentage of the nutritional value inside the bean; so don’t throw your grounds in the trashcan.Coffee grounds contain rich amounts of nitrogen and function as a perfect natural fertilizer for your plants. By adding organic material to the soil, you will improve drainage, water retention and aeration.You can also use it to absorb food odor. Simply place your coffee grounds in an open container and leave it inside your refrigerator. After a few weeks, you can still use the same coffee grounds as fertilizer. It also makes a great exfoliating body scrub. Mix your coffee grounds with a bit of warm water and you’re ready to exfoliate your skin.In case you want to read more about how to use your coffee grounds click on the buzzfeed below: Not only have we designed GRUMS for the perfect french press experience, but we've also made an easy solution to save your grounds. It's simple to use. Slide the lid to the side, knock the grounds into the container and close the lid again, done.    We’ve made it easy for you to make French press coffee. We’ve designed markings inside of the cup, so you can easily fill it with the right amount of coffee for you. The markings make it more consistent than spoon measuring.When it’s time to clean your carafe, you’ll see why GRUMS is the one French press accessory you never want to be without. Because all the grounds remain nice and tidy inside the cup, there’s less grounds residue to clean up in the carafe and in your sink. Just knock the grounds out in your bin. Imagine how much water you’ll save, and how much easier it is to enjoy another cup. Get ready in seconds and get ready again. It’s Friday night and you’re having a dinner party with all your best friends. Normally you would choose the coffeemaker because you need to make multiple pots, but to be true to yourself, you prefer the French press way. With GRUMS, you can clean the used carafe quickly and have it loaded again and ready to go.Imagine the compliments you’ll get serving your guests delicious and aromatic French press coffee.    This is how it normally looks. Ah, the drain pain! Cleaning a carafe will fill your sink and takes a lot of water to re-clean.  - and clog your drain, heavily!​ Although the idea of GRUMS is simple, those ideas are often the hardest to bring into reality. Though the design of GRUMS looks similar to any other small bowl or container, there’s so much more than what meets the eye.First, the outer diameter was one of our greatest design challenges and our most proud accomplishment. After attempting numerous variations of wall thickness, diameter, height, and shape of the outer wall, we finally landed at 90 mm diameter and a 1 mm wall thickness for GRUMS (see below) to effortlessly pass into the carafe.At the same time, the groove pattern on the side of GRUMS is an essential design component. The grooves allow for water to pass and relieve the amount of vacuum and suction created at the bottom of the glass carafe for easy removal.Even the logo on the lower side of GRUMS plays an important role. Notice how it is elevated to assist in the removal of the cup as you lift the plunger. Honestly, without these small technical tricks and design features the product would not work as effectively as it should. Instead, the carafe piston/filter would be pulled out of GRUMS during lifting procedure.The Knock-box is not complicated. A small bin and a cross bar.The lid is easy to move as its made as a sliding- turning lid like on a old tobacco can. The bin content will hold you about 20 pcs of Grums.Small grooves on the side will ensure some air ventilation to the inside that will prevent mold to build.   Finding the right material is our next challenge.Thus far, we have so far only made prototypes, but we are encouraged that medical Polypropylene, Nylon or ABS will do the job. We will test all of these materials to see what is best – both in terms of molding and in use.In use, we aim for a material that elongates and retracts to a minimum. As our unit is thin, we look for good flow in molding. And finally, we must only consider food grade materials that are 100% free from migrating any harmful components. We also realize that some people may have an aversion to synthetic material, so we are also considering ways to make GRUMS in aluminum, but that extension will only happen after we’ve perfected the original GRUMS we’re proposing to you now.    We can make our first mold tooling.Once we receive our moldings, we will test and retest every facet of the unit. We will be vigilant in improving the material and the design. It may mean adding 1/10 mm here and there, but we won’t be satisfied until we know we have perfected GRUMS.

For the past five years, we have been running a successful pet service business and decided it was time to expand our company.</p><p>The expansion started with a simple idea that came after a backpacking trip two years ago. Bailey, Cat’s Rottweiler, was going on a four day trip with her family in the Sierras. Bailey is not the type of dog that feels comfortable wearing a saddle harness to carry her own backpacking items. After putting a side-saddle harness on her and receiving the very sad puppy dog eyes (she can really play it up!), Cat relented and decided her family should carry Bailey’s food and bowls. Bailey’s kibble took up so much room in the family bear box that she had to go out and purchase a second box! Cat was able to pack food and toiletries in one bear box for five people for four days (yes, thank you, she is an expert bear box packer) and it was still lighter than the bear box containing Bailey’s food. After the first day of carrying her gear and Bailey’s food she asked herself the question, “Wouldn’t it be awesome if there was a lightweight dog food that came in a package that we didn’t have to pack out?” Hence, the Hi Tailin’ It! product line was born.</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHY AN INDIEGOGO CAMPAIGN?</strong></p><p>We are asking the INDIEGOGO community for assistance in helping our company build brand awareness so that every dog lover can provide their furry friend with a full belly wherever they land.</p><p>We are raising money to help cover the costs of building inventory, upgrading our packaging and labels, and funding participation in trade shows/events.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620149774/ukprrfjbxmervrm6yeix.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>OUR PRODUCTS</strong></p><p>The <strong>Hi Tailin' It!

For the past five years, we have been running a successful pet service business and decided it was time to expand our company.The expansion started with a simple idea that came after a backpacking trip two years ago. Bailey, Cat’s Rottweiler, was going on a four day trip with her family in the Sierras. Bailey is not the type of dog that feels comfortable wearing a saddle harness to carry her own backpacking items. After putting a side-saddle harness on her and receiving the very sad puppy dog eyes (she can really play it up!), Cat relented and decided her family should carry Bailey’s food and bowls. Bailey’s kibble took up so much room in the family bear box that she had to go out and purchase a second box! Cat was able to pack food and toiletries in one bear box for five people for four days (yes, thank you, she is an expert bear box packer) and it was still lighter than the bear box containing Bailey’s food. After the first day of carrying her gear and Bailey’s food she asked herself the question, “Wouldn’t it be awesome if there was a lightweight dog food that came in a package that we didn’t have to pack out?” Hence, the Hi Tailin’ It! product line was born. WHY AN INDIEGOGO CAMPAIGN?We are asking the INDIEGOGO community for assistance in helping our company build brand awareness so that every dog lover can provide their furry friend with a full belly wherever they land.We are raising money to help cover the costs of building inventory, upgrading our packaging and labels, and funding participation in trade shows/events.  OUR PRODUCTSThe Hi Tailin' It! On the Go line is a simple and delicious freeze-dried dog food specifically made and packaged for active dogs on the go. Whether you are camping, hiking, or backpacking with your dog, or just need to travel away from home, Hi Tailin' It! On the Go products can provide an easy grab-and-go meal. The pouch the food comes in is water-soluble, meaning it will dissolve once mixed with water. After Fido finishes eating, place the pouch in water, swish around 30 seconds, and watch it disappear.  Nothing for the landfill!(BEEF RECIPE) The Hi Tailin' It!

<p>Ernest Hemingway’s The Old Man and The Sea is our favorite classic. An old man named Santiago is a symbol pf ingrained human obstinacy. Most of the time, ordeals in life can make us suffer and spark our fierce reactions; as a matter of fact, we don't necessarily have to feel paltry and small when facing our fates.

Since I’m under 18, I wonder if I can order AIRCPHOLIC products.<br/><strong>A1</strong>. Under most of the laws around the world, you’re not allowed to purchase alcoholic drinks if you’re under 18; however, you can still order AIRCPHOLIC products considering that AIRCPHOLIC is an eye-catching glassware with exquisite designs. You may try the magical air liquor effect when reaching the age of majority. </p><p><strong>Q2</strong>. How to clean the device?<br/><strong>A2</strong>. The gasification of liquor is completed when droplets stop forming on the surface above liquor; blow out the candle through the pore and clean the device after it has completely cooled down. You may insert the straw into the glass ball and let the liquor left inside flow out through it; wash the glass ball with water and put it in a dish dryer or above a lighted candle for proper drying, preparing for the next marvelous experience.</p><p><strong>Q3</strong>. Where AIRCPHOLIC originates?<br/><strong>A3</strong>. AIRCPHOLIC is produced in Taiwan; designed by a team of Taiwanese food scientists and the glassware is 100% handmade in Taiwan.</p><p><strong>Q4</strong>. What are the differences between AIRCPHOLIC and other gaseous liquor devices?<br/><strong>A4</strong>. Liquor gasification can be achieved through three approaches including ultrasonic atomization, high-pressure gasification or distillation; ultrasonic atomization can generate smoke but the mouthfeel is flat and unpleasant, on the contrary, there will be no smoke generated in AIRCPHOLIC device. It aims to offer you the finest sensory experience based on the most appealing parameters acquired in numerous food sensory evaluation experiments that can satisfy 90% of sensory evaluators.</p><p><strong>Q5</strong>. Does AIRCPHOLIC have warranty?<br/><strong>A5</strong>. AIRCPHOLIC is not warranted against artificial damage; when receiving a defective or damaged product as a result of any non-artificial damage, we will provide full support in exchanging it. Be sure to contact us immediately once this situation takes place; a request proposed three days after delivery will not be attended to.</p><p><strong>Q6</strong>. For whom AIRCPHOLIC air liquor is suitable?<br/><strong>A6</strong>. In our point of view, all the liquor lovers will fall for AIRCPHOLIC, for it offers entertaining drinking experiences beyond ordinary; on top of that, cigar connoisseurs will surely be obsessed with it. </p><p><strong>Q7</strong>. Is it safe?<br/><strong>A7</strong>. Among all the gaseous liquor devices available on the market, AIRCPHOLIC is the only product that adopts lead-free, heat-resistant borosilicate glass as its material and designed based on precise parameters; AIRCPHOLIC can tolerate an instantaneous temperature jump within 212°F (100°C) which effectively eliminates the risks of shattering.</p><p><strong>Q8</strong>. Can I drive after using AIRCPHOLIC?<br/><strong>A8</strong>. To drive immediately after tasting AIRCPHOLIC air liquor is forbidden, yet the time consumed for air liquor to be metabolized is shorter than that in regular alcohol metabolism. 30 minutes after the last inhalation, your BAC level will drop to 0% rapidly and it will be safe to drive then.</p><p><strong>Q9</strong>. As an asthma patient, can I use AIRCPHOLIC?<br/><strong>A9</strong>. We reckon that it is better to not to smoke anything if you have asthma, alcohol intolerance or sensitive respiratory system, therefore we do not suggest using AIRCPHOLIC.</p><p><strong>Q10</strong>. Will there be smoke generated during use?<br/><strong>A10</strong>. There will be no smoke generated while using AIRCPHOLIC since it offers you cigar-like, tobacco-like mouthfeel of air liquor and has no direct combustion that generates smoke. It is a secret delight that you can enjoy privately in the office without being noticed. </p><p><strong>Q11</strong>. What would happen to the liquor that I poured in? Gasified? Disappeared? Or leave only alcohol-free liquid in the bottle?<br/><strong>A11</strong>. Alcohol in the liquor will be partially gasified; when there’s no gaseous ethanol movement observable in the bottle or the mouthfeel turns flat, it means there’s not much alcohol left in the liquor, mostly just water, carbohydrate and flavoring substances. You may empty the bottle and pour in new liquor afterward. </p><p><strong>Q12</strong>. 100% handmade AIRCPHOLIC is fancy but also a bit pricey; have you ever considered putting into mass production? <br/><strong>A12</strong>. There’s an important reason why we keep AIRCPHOLIC completely handmade; only when applying handmade techniques, the uniqueness of AIRCPHOLIC and the sensation it creates can be fully expressed. We offer you the best price during our Indiegogo campaign, and within this price range, you can barely find any other glassware manually traced in fine gold that is manufactured in Taiwan. And currently, we have no plan for low-cost mass production of AIRCPHOLIC.</p><p><strong>Q13</strong>. Is it only for hard liquor? Can I still taste the aroma of liquor during the use?<br/><strong>A13</strong>. Only liquors over 35% ABV are adoptable for AIRCPHOLIC, better yet, over 40% ABV. Through AIRCPHOLIC, the wonderful flavors of liquors get to be fully released in their gaseous state; the uniqueness and richness of aromas will continuously tickle your taste buds providing you with ultimate enjoyment. </p><p><strong>If you have further questions or wish to contact NatureGift, you may press the bottom below to send us an email.</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1535360388/hfy8fefa8htpsiinfobk.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""mailto:contact@naturegiftfood.com?subject=Fr_INDEIGOGO%20Backer"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529052436/fmbodvvao39m71u62g4w.png"" src=""""/></a></p></div>","For its excellence, we believe AIRCPHOLIC is the best air liquor product ever, it has raised more than $ 520,000 USD in Taiwan and Japan and received highly positive feedback from all the backers.

 Liquor looks like smooth, fluid water, but its soul conflicts with its appearance, deep inside there’s a more complex undercurrent hidden, intense and passionate, just like fire. We keep the core concept of “firewater” in mind which leads us to a simple and neat design, and outlines the product that contains the concepts of unyielding and soft, intense and relaxed, harmony and incompatibility at the same time.With this primary cognition, we merge two conflicting geometries－sphere and rectangle－to create the unique, tense but also incredibly balanced atmosphere. The shiny and transparent glass material allows us to observe the waterfall-like air liquor stream down the inner surface, let us be amused by its wonderful looks and tastes. AIRCPHOLIC’s glassware was completely hand blown by master artisans in Taiwan. Each step is crucial; the amount of viscous molten glass collected on the tip of blowpipe must be precise, otherwise an uneven shaping might take place in the following steps. Glassblowing is just like performing on the most difficult musical instruments, there must be enough air blown into the pipe for successful expansion of a molten blob. The artisan takes the exact amount of molten glass into a refractory mold based on his experiences, and then adjusts to perfection by continuously observing and blowing. All the steps require extra attention to details, and the semi-finished products will be abandoned once a tiny mistake takes place. The quality depends mostly on the skill and performance of the artisan.  The streamline pattern on glass stand manually traced in fine gold is reminiscent of Ogata Kōrin’s famous painting “Red and White Plum Blossoms”; there is a touch of Zen in the concise subject and the splendid, subtle grid of gold leaf. It also brings Gustav Klimt’s “Adele Bloch-Bauer I” to our mind with its dignified, graceful and elegant decorations.AIRCPHOLIC is a perfect marriage of food science and glass crafting; its exquisite appearance is designed in precise details: 3.86-inch/98mm -diameter sphere, 2.99-inch/76mm desired flame height, 0.55-inch/14mm bore and the maltodextrin coating on inner surface of the sphere allow air to flow on each inhalation; these details were constantly adjusted and calibrated to reach the parameters of exhibiting the most appealing air liquors. A small variance on the dimension of the sphere or bore size might lead to imprecise temperature regulation, and the air liquor generated might burn your mouth or be flat and dull.     The temperature remains steady at 154.4°F～172.4°F（73±5°C）within 2 hours use. Just add any liquor you wish to taste and enjoy the best experience that air liquor delivers. The taste of liquor will be elevated to a whole new level; let the rich flavor relaxes your body as if you’re on holiday with the premium cigar holding between your fingers. 100% Hand blown glass ball        We adopt lead-free, heat-resistant borosilicate glass as the material for AIRCPHOLIC’s liquor container, it is durable to an instantaneous temperature difference of 212°F(100°C) and free from risks of cracking or shattering when subjected to it. The inner surface is sandblasted with Maltodextrin for a better effect on enriching the tastes of different air liquors.100% Hand blown glass stand        AIRCPHOLIC’s glassware was 100% hand blown by master artisans in Taiwan. The glass stand is also made of lead-free, heat-resistant borosilicate glass with durability over an instantaneous temperature difference of 212°F (100°C) and a thermal durability up to 1292°F(700°C).
AIRCPHOLIC straw accessory kit (316 stainless steel straw + cleaning brush)
        High-purity, corrosion-resistant 316 stainless steel was processed under strict food production procedure which includes grinding, polishing, passivating and then dry heat sterilization. Grommet        Rubber grommet for fixing stainless steel straw at a proper height for a better, more convenient use and to avoid straw from colliding with the glass ball.Stainless steel funnel        304 stainless steel funnel is for pouring liquor into the glass ball, you may also rest the straw on it as a straw holder when not in use; an overheated straw might reduce palatability. Non-reusable, odorless candle        The 1.5x0.59 inch (38x15 mm) candle has a good thermal stability which lasts for 4 hours; you may replenish your supply with GLIMMA candle from IKEA for a better consistent use.Enjoy the breeze that boosts your energy in this liquor banquet, it is easy and fun to use. When assembling AIRCPHOLIC, the unique atmosphere, excitement and anticipation remind us of the curiosity and joy we had when gluing parts together on a model kit back in our childhoods. It is fun to enjoy the pleasure brought by AIRCPHOLIC either alone or with friends.AIRCPHOLIC project has received a lot of support in Japan and Taiwan and the products have already been shipping to all the campaign backers.We further launch this campaign on Indiegogo based on our successful experiences; this is also NatureGift’s first step to break into the Western markets. We look forward to collecting more and more users’ experiences on how AIRCPHOLIC harmonizes with finest spirits around the world. We have excluded all the possible production problems, yet our delivery date might be influenced by the actual status of local logistics, leading to potential shipping risks. Your support is highly appreciated and we will be dedicated to offering you the best air liquor feast ever in the shortest time possible.The standard AIRCPHOLIC product offers you a candle, due to some international airmail restrictions; we might not offer the candle according to the local regulations, in this case, you just need to purchase the GLIMMA candles from nearest IKEA for use. (For the best results and for your safety we recommend only GLIMMA candles.)NatureGift is a Taiwanese team of scientists that specializes in food chemistry; we provide numerous companies in food industry with our services which include ethanol blending techniques, setting formulas of wheat varieties/flours from Australia and developing meat analogues based on our scientific background knowledge. NatureGift often takes the path not trodden in traditional food industry. Since innovation is our core value, we resolve to create new possibilities and fun in human senses through various techniques in food chemistry, bringing sensory experiences to a whole new level that no one has ever reached before. Q1. Since I’m under 18, I wonder if I can order AIRCPHOLIC products.A1. Under most of the laws around the world, you’re not allowed to purchase alcoholic drinks if you’re under 18; however, you can still order AIRCPHOLIC products considering that AIRCPHOLIC is an eye-catching glassware with exquisite designs. You may try the magical air liquor effect when reaching the age of majority. Q2. How to clean the device?A2. The gasification of liquor is completed when droplets stop forming on the surface above liquor; blow out the candle through the pore and clean the device after it has completely cooled down. You may insert the straw into the glass ball and let the liquor left inside flow out through it; wash the glass ball with water and put it in a dish dryer or above a lighted candle for proper drying, preparing for the next marvelous experience.Q3. Where AIRCPHOLIC originates?A3. AIRCPHOLIC is produced in Taiwan; designed by a team of Taiwanese food scientists and the glassware is 100% handmade in Taiwan.Q4. What are the differences between AIRCPHOLIC and other gaseous liquor devices?A4. Liquor gasification can be achieved through three approaches including ultrasonic atomization, high-pressure gasification or distillation; ultrasonic atomization can generate smoke but the mouthfeel is flat and unpleasant, on the contrary, there will be no smoke generated in AIRCPHOLIC device. It aims to offer you the finest sensory experience based on the most appealing parameters acquired in numerous food sensory evaluation experiments that can satisfy 90% of sensory evaluators.Q5. Does AIRCPHOLIC have warranty?A5. AIRCPHOLIC is not warranted against artificial damage; when receiving a defective or damaged product as a result of any non-artificial damage, we will provide full support in exchanging it. Be sure to contact us immediately once this situation takes place; a request proposed three days after delivery will not be attended to.Q6. For whom AIRCPHOLIC air liquor is suitable?A6. In our point of view, all the liquor lovers will fall for AIRCPHOLIC, for it offers entertaining drinking experiences beyond ordinary; on top of that, cigar connoisseurs will surely be obsessed with it. Q7. Is it safe?A7. Among all the gaseous liquor devices available on the market, AIRCPHOLIC is the only product that adopts lead-free, heat-resistant borosilicate glass as its material and designed based on precise parameters; AIRCPHOLIC can tolerate an instantaneous temperature jump within 212°F (100°C) which effectively eliminates the risks of shattering.Q8. Can I drive after using AIRCPHOLIC?A8. To drive immediately after tasting AIRCPHOLIC air liquor is forbidden, yet the time consumed for air liquor to be metabolized is shorter than that in regular alcohol metabolism. 30 minutes after the last inhalation, your BAC level will drop to 0% rapidly and it will be safe to drive then.Q9. As an asthma patient, can I use AIRCPHOLIC?A9. We reckon that it is better to not to smoke anything if you have asthma, alcohol intolerance or sensitive respiratory system, therefore we do not suggest using AIRCPHOLIC.Q10. Will there be smoke generated during use?A10. There will be no smoke generated while using AIRCPHOLIC since it offers you cigar-like, tobacco-like mouthfeel of air liquor and has no direct combustion that generates smoke. It is a secret delight that you can enjoy privately in the office without being noticed. Q11. What would happen to the liquor that I poured in? Gasified? Disappeared? Or leave only alcohol-free liquid in the bottle?A11. Alcohol in the liquor will be partially gasified; when there’s no gaseous ethanol movement observable in the bottle or the mouthfeel turns flat, it means there’s not much alcohol left in the liquor, mostly just water, carbohydrate and flavoring substances. You may empty the bottle and pour in new liquor afterward. Q12. 100% handmade AIRCPHOLIC is fancy but also a bit pricey; have you ever considered putting into mass production? A12. There’s an important reason why we keep AIRCPHOLIC completely handmade; only when applying handmade techniques, the uniqueness of AIRCPHOLIC and the sensation it creates can be fully expressed. We offer you the best price during our Indiegogo campaign, and within this price range, you can barely find any other glassware manually traced in fine gold that is manufactured in Taiwan. And currently, we have no plan for low-cost mass production of AIRCPHOLIC.Q13. Is it only for hard liquor? Can I still taste the aroma of liquor during the use?A13. Only liquors over 35% ABV are adoptable for AIRCPHOLIC, better yet, over 40% ABV. Through AIRCPHOLIC, the wonderful flavors of liquors get to be fully released in their gaseous state; the uniqueness and richness of aromas will continuously tickle your taste buds providing you with ultimate enjoyment. If you have further questions or wish to contact NatureGift, you may press the bottom below to send us an email.",57.0,2,"1 Campaign

</div></figure></div>","Lunchtime: It’s the most difficult time of the day to control what you eat. 
Eating out or getting takeout can be costly and it's almost impossible to know what's in the food.
That's why we created the Prepd Pack, a revolutionary new take on the humble lunchbox.

 





 

 
From planning and preparing, to tracking the nutritional value of your lunches, together with our app, Prepd Pack makes the whole process easier and more enjoyable.  
Prepd Pack consists of a beautifully designed case, a premium modular system of containers and smart magnetic cutlery.


 
The removable modular containers are central to Prepd’s functionality — corresponding to each day’s needs, these individual food compartments can be combined in multiple configurations within the Prepd Pack. Made from the highest-quality materials, the containers are food-safe and completely leak-proof. 
 

 
Our immersive app makes prepping your lunches for the weeks ahead simple. We partnered with professional chefs and nutritionists to create an evolving library of recipes tailored to fit a broad range of diets, appetites, and health goals.
All available recipes are designed to fill the modular containers, perfectly — making meal prepping less complicated, and, by eliminating unwanted food waste, more efficient.
Get ready for a simpler and smarter grocery-shopping experience — our app will take care of organizing shopping lists, so you’ll know exactly what to buy the moment you get to the store.
The Prepd app will be available for both Android and iOS smartphones and will be free for all backers.
  

 


 

 
Finding calorie counting difficult? Relax — the Prepd app does all the math for you. By filling your Prepd Pack (and tummy) with our mouthwatering recipes, you’ll gain instant access to precise and in-depth nutritional information.
All collected data is stored within the app, giving you meaningful on-demand feedback about your diet. The app will also connect with HealthKit on iOS, allowing you to conveniently navigate all your health and fitness information in one place.
  

 


 
The app is filled with prep-friendly meal plans, making batch cooking extremely efficient — just imagine preparing a week’s worth of lunches in under an hour.  
Developed by experienced meal preppers, these original plans are delicious and ingeniously diverse, making your everyday meals exciting and uniquely different.
We've done the hard work, so you don't have to. Bon appétit!
 




 


 

 
The modular glass-clear containers nest perfectly atop one another, making fridge storage neat and (since you can plainly see what’s inside each container) insightful.
Have your lunch ready to go when you are — order multiple sets of containers and prep ahead for as many meals as you want. 
Save time for other things, like enjoying your morning coffee.
 
  


 

 
Joining the Prepd community lets you connect and share ideas with people who, like you, are passionate about food and health — a place to discover endless amounts of tips and tricks for prepping better lunches.
By creating your very own profile page, you’ll be able to browse the interactive library and save recipes to curate your own meal plans.
  


 

 
Homemade lunches are infinitely healthier — keeping both you and your wallet in better shape. With the Prepd Pack you can enjoy a delicious lunch and save money. *Spending values obtained from the 2015 Lunch Survey by Visa.



 

 
The ever-increasing amount of plastic packaging is exacerbating the environmental footprint. Unlike takeout, using the Prepd Pack is completely waste-free 
We don’t just talk the talk, we’re serious about sustainability. In an effort of tackling climate change, we’ve chosen to manufacture the Prepd Pack from high-quality recycled and eco-friendly materials.
 

 
Take part in the fight for our planet. Cut down on unnecessary food waste by preparing your own lunches and controlling exactly how much you consume.  


 


The Prepd Sleeve will insulate your Prepd Pack with a layer of premium fabric-lined Neoprene (a flexible, heat- and wear-resistant material, used for making wetsuits) — providing extra protection and ensuring your food’s temperature stays consistent during longer commutes.


The Sleeve’s stylish strap also allows you to carry the Prepd Pack in one hand, effortlessly and securely. Personalize your Prepd Pack’s color, choose either Stone Grey, Charcoal Black, or Prepd Blue.



Freeze the cold packs overnight and clip them inside your Prepd Pack to keep your food cool and fresh for even longer. Seamless and unobtrusive, the cold packs easily dock along both sides of the Prepd Pack without taking up any usable space.  






 


 Years in the making, and leaving no stone unturned, we have meticulously considered every functional and aesthetic detail of the Prepd Pack.

 First Prototype
 
Together with knowledgeable nutritionists and innovative meal preppers, we’ve created a solution that will put an end to all your hesitations about taking your homemade lunch to work.
CMF and DFM process
 
Modern look, contemporary build — so you can trust that your food is sealed and secure, and that you look chic carrying it around.
 Current Product
 



 

 
We are really excited about bringing the Prepd app to life. And not without reason — more than a simple recipe bank, the app will help you regain control over lunchtime, hit health goals, and stick to resolutions.
Our app’s UI design is clean, is easy-to-navigate, and is cross-device functional. Plan your meals on your iPad, then get your shopping lists on your iPhone — and Android devices too!
 


We are a team of award winning designers and engineers with the united goal of make healthy living easier and more enjoyable through good design.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>  Max Boeke and Jordan Standish started home brewing over ten years ago, before they were of legal age to do so (that can be our secret...). As their quest for knowledge and brewing gravitas grew, the old brew stand of welded together bed frames was transformed into a handmade semi automated system that would brew hundreds of gallons of beer. While gathering industry experience, from distribution to production brewing, Jordan and Max had their sights on starting their own business, a brewery with strong community roots and a classic styling that produces unique beers that people of all walks of life can enjoy. Unless you're a kid. If you're a kid then you can enjoy the craft sodas Clutch Brewing will make.  Thus, Clutch Brewing Company was born. </p>

<h3>
<strong>The Name and the Space   </strong>       </h3>
<p>  Since Jordan and Max grew up in motor oriented families, Clutch seemed like the perfect analogy for highlighting the power of the community, and the ever growing appreciation for craft beer that is shifting the craft beer industry into the next gear. In the spring of 2017, Clutch Brewing Company signed a lease for the mezzanine level of the <i>Keg and Case Market</i>. Occupying the old keg house of the historic Schmidt Brewing in St. Paul, MN, the <i>Keg and Case Market</i> will house restaurants, a coffee shop, dessert shops, and a 30 stall indoor farmers market which will offer a variety of locally grown foods, crafts, and small plate vendors. Clutch Brewing Company will be lofted above it all with a tap room and brewery that will provide exceptional views of the action below. The tap room will also feature a lounge for more comfortable social interactions and a  small museum to pay homage to the history of one of Minnesota's most Iconic brewing landmarks. Working with local artists has always been an important part of Clutch Brewing, which is why there will be a local St. Paul art gallery to display local works, and offer exposure during our Beer/Artist of the Month collaborations. At Clutch Brewing, we don't want to just offer fantastic beer, we want everyone who walks through our door to experience everything that makes St. Paul such a great place. </p>

<p><strong>Outta' Style Classic American Cream Ale</strong>- A dry hopped take on an American classic with a delightfully hoppy nose and slightly malty body. Light and refreshing. It's our Cream Ale to your Pale Ale. Or, your Cream Ale to our Pale Ale. Either way, it's hard to only have one.  ABV: 5.5%</p>
<p><strong>Sweet Jane Milk Stout</strong>- Rich and full bodied, this lovely beer has hints of chocolate, coffee, and roast, while remaining smooth with a creamy finish. This is among our favorites and is truly a joy anytime of year. ABV: 6%</p>
<p><strong>Exhaustdead Smoked Black IPA</strong>- This distinct IPA has a hint of smoke over a roasty malt backbone, providing a slight dryness that compliments the herbal bitterness of Columbus hops.

<p><strong>Barnstomp Bier de Garde</strong> - This french style ale is clean but malty with hints of toast, biscuit, and toffee with just a touch of black currant. It's the perfect way to end the day, or start the day, depending on your intentions. ABV: 7%</p>
<p><strong>Straight 8 American IPA</strong>- Definitely for the IPA lover at heart. Loads of citrus and stone fruit with a clean bitterness to balance. ABV: 7%</p>

We really are just two people determined to drive CHANGE in the industry!Where we are now Our brand has become a neighborhood staple in Huntington Beach, Orange Home Grown Farmers Market, in addition to wider events around LA and Orange County such as the Rooted in Wellness event in Venice Beach at The Unlikely Florist.  As you can imagine, these are all places where sound and pollution are not a good fit!  We wish we could remove the gas generator and install a completely sustainable solution ourselves,  but like many eco-friendly technologies, such transformation comes at a huge cost and this is where we need your help. We do not want your help for no return (although there is an option to do that). In return for your support of our journey and our wider vision for the planet, we will give you a range of super exclusive, limited edition, cool products that we think you will enjoy - all while promoting a cause which concerns every one of us; the environment. Whether you are a local or an international investor, we have supplies readily prepared with you in mind. Of course, you may have some unanswered questions, so please read on to understand who we are, all the ins and outs, and how we propose to be the first fully-sustainable, vegan coffee truck in California.We are Miffies Coffee, a husband and wife duo from the UK.  2019 was the beginning of our unique journey in starting a business that was the first of its kind; California's first, fully plant-based coffee truck. This was an invigorating venture to begin from the other side of the world, though we can't doubt it arrived with some logistical challenges (not to mention a global pandemic!). Nevertheless, this is what has made our arrival on the West Coast all the more rewarding. As avid travelers, we first visited the West Coast in 2018, and it has been our dream to build a life out here ever since. There's something about opening a roaming coffee truck in the UK that doesn't have the same appeal as opening in the Sunshine Coast! With this in mind, it was time we started to make this dream a reality.  After all, the West Coast is the best coast and it really was love at first sight.Who can resist those UNREAL sunsets?! Because we've both been vegan for over 3 years (for all health, ethical and environmental reasons), selling exclusively plant-based was a non-negotiable for us. What's more, oat milk is starting to outsell dairy in the coffee industry and whether vegan or not, we believe oat milk tastes the best in coffee.  While we're setting a great example that coffee tastes even better with plant-based alternatives, we really want to enshrine our value around sustainability. There are a lot of things that you don't quite realize before you run a coffee business, and even more so a mobile coffee business! We're now increasingly aware of the waste, water consumption, and gasoline such businesses produce, but there are ways we can severely reduce this.  We want to be the pioneers of the movement by running our truck without gasoline, resulting in a much smaller footprint on the planet.  After all, plant-based is truly encompassing, and for us, it means being mindful of our lifestyle choices as much as our food choices, in order to better ourselves and the planet.Coffee trucks need a lot of power; far more power than traditional food trucks! Our truck operates for up to 6 hours a day on the following equipment:
La Marzocco 2 group espresso machine
Fetco drip filter coffee machine
Mahlkonig Grinder EK43
Mahlkonig Grinder K30
Stagg Kettle
2x Vitamix
Double fronted fridge
Chest Freezer
Water Heater
Water Pumps
Lights
Fans
As you can imagine that requires A LOT of power ??  We currently have a 10,000 watt Honda generator to generate all of this power we need. Its original purpose is to power equipment on construction sites,  so as you can imagine, the noise was not a primary concern when this was designed! Concern 1: Noise.Of course, it does the job for now, but we want to reduce the noise for our lovely customers and their neighbors who so kindly welcome us into their neighborhood. We want to be able to make coffee and hear just the warming sound of the steam wand; not the sound of the generator trying to run a marathon right by a megaphone! Whilst we give the hogs that roar down Pacific Coast Highway a run for their money, we want to provide the locals with good coffee and conversation, not disrupt and upset neighbors with the noise. Concern 2: Exhaust Gases.  Burning gasoline is a smelly business and one that creates a harmful by-product, Carbon Monoxide.  While gasoline is so widely used in all industries, it's not safe for us, our staff, or our customers to ingest, not to mention its huge negative impact on the environment.  Concern 3: The vibrations.Those coffee nerds among us will know that we have to weigh every single shot of espresso made. As you can imagine a powerful generator, therefore, produces a lot of movement, making it difficult for us to use surrounding space effectively and also affecting the use of the coffee grinder.Summary:In short, the generator is a beast, but perhaps not in a good way!  We want to be able to attend all types of events such as those below as well which will allow our business to grow and add to the areas we service. We did explore the possibility of being powered by either a battery bank and solar panels when we first started developing our truck from the UK, however, there were a few blockers to this plan, one of these being our lack of knowledge and resource while we were concentrating our efforts on opening the business and the move to America.  Because gas generators are the current staple in an industry we were then so new to, we couldn't lean on our truck fabricators to help build a viable solution either.

</div>Hi my name is <b>Aaron Castello</b>. I'm 31 years old and work as a salesman in NY. One thing that have come to my mind, when being a guy who sits alot during his work and studder, is that drinks really should not be drinken without ice cubes. Once you go ice cubes, you almost never go back, but you don't know how ice berg cold a drink really can get if you're only drinking your soda, juice, water or anything else merely from the bottle or a glass. <div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1019158/files/20141116062226-Sk_rmbillede_2014-11-16_kl._15.25.04.png?1416147746"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><div>I've come to be a pretty heavy ice cube user over the past 2 years at my current company, and have thought about: ""how to make the drinks taste more delicious, for everyone"". The real answer was found in the current ice cube bags. They are all too big and huge. Yeah i'm also one of those who can't get them to fit in the freezer. <div>+ the fact that i can't put my ice cubes wherever i want. </div>
<div>My solution to this is by having smaller ice bags. I have formed out a product line with my company <b>VEYICO</b> to make ice cube bags the size of an iPhone 4s box, including 60 small cubes that will make your drink taste a lot better. </div>
<div>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1019174/files/20141116062707-Sk_rmbillede_2014-11-16_kl._15.24.47.png?1416148027"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<div>
<b>1)</b> Get your ice cubes done in the freezer in only 20 minutes! NOT 2 hrs, NOT! 3 hrs!</div>
<div>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">2) </b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Let your kids handle the ice cubes after all it's user friendly for anyone now and they won't get cold burned. NO BIG ICE CUBES EXTREMELY COLD!</span>
</div>
<div>
<b>3)</b> Get more delicious drinks. We all know a lot of smaller ice cubes who fill out your liquid is better than 3 big. <br/><b>4) </b>Don't worry about opening them. They will come in an easy strip up bag. NO more trouble with opening and getting the cubes out!<br/><b>5)</b> Pour ice cubes down your Coca-Cola bottles. <br/><b>6)</b> Get space in the freezer NO MORE FULL FREEZER!!!</div>

<b>ABOVE </b>is just a few of the advantages i know my bag will bring. I have searched and found legit manufacturers for these bags with a direct shipping line in US, Europe &amp; Asia. </div>
<div>This means that no matter where you live in this beautiful happy world, you can order my ice cube bags and have them delivered strait to your door. Doing projects and adding new things is a serious and fun thing for me. Serious because i value making the best product for you guys possible, yet fun because i gotta have my goofyness with me while being passionate about something.

</div>
<div>It's important for me that this project gets funded as it's something i really want and wanna work hard to let happen. I wanna make the best ice cube bag that fits your needs, that gives you: space, better drinks &amp; better opportunities and then i'm gonna do it fairly fairly fairly cheap...

</div></div>","Hi my name is Aaron Castello. I'm 31 years old and work as a salesman in NY. One thing that have come to my mind, when being a guy who sits alot during his work and studder, is that drinks really should not be drinken without ice cubes. Once you go ice cubes, you almost never go back, but you don't know how ice berg cold a drink really can get if you're only drinking your soda, juice, water or anything else merely from the bottle or a glass. I've come to be a pretty heavy ice cube user over the past 2 years at my current company, and have thought about: ""how to make the drinks taste more delicious, for everyone"". The real answer was found in the current ice cube bags. They are all too big and huge. Yeah i'm also one of those who can't get them to fit in the freezer. + the fact that i can't put my ice cubes wherever i want. 
My solution to this is by having smaller ice bags. I have formed out a product line with my company VEYICO to make ice cube bags the size of an iPhone 4s box, including 60 small cubes that will make your drink taste a lot better. 




1) Get your ice cubes done in the freezer in only 20 minutes! NOT 2 hrs, NOT! 3 hrs!

2) Let your kids handle the ice cubes after all it's user friendly for anyone now and they won't get cold burned. NO BIG ICE CUBES EXTREMELY COLD!


3) Get more delicious drinks. We all know a lot of smaller ice cubes who fill out your liquid is better than 3 big. 4) Don't worry about opening them. They will come in an easy strip up bag. NO more trouble with opening and getting the cubes out!5) Pour ice cubes down your Coca-Cola bottles. 6) Get space in the freezer NO MORE FULL FREEZER!!!






ABOVE is just a few of the advantages i know my bag will bring. I have searched and found legit manufacturers for these bags with a direct shipping line in US, Europe & Asia. 
This means that no matter where you live in this beautiful happy world, you can order my ice cube bags and have them delivered strait to your door. Doing projects and adding new things is a serious and fun thing for me. Serious because i value making the best product for you guys possible, yet fun because i gotta have my goofyness with me while being passionate about something. You might also have experienced that in my voice-over video ABOVE! 




It's important for me that this project gets funded as it's something i really want and wanna work hard to let happen. I wanna make the best ice cube bag that fits your needs, that gives you: space, better drinks & better opportunities and then i'm gonna do it fairly fairly fairly cheap... Cuz who wants to spend a million bucks on something they can get much cheaper. I wanna make the best product and i wanna do it only for you guys! 
Now the part i have been most excited about through my whole speach here. YOU GUYS! It would mean honestly the world to me if you guys would fund my project. I don't care about rich or poor, if you donate 1$ or a 1,000$ the fact is that you share my vision and wanna back it up. The fact that some of you might take your time to read this is honestly enough for me. I hope you awesome people out there might share same vision and might see a young? hahah fairly committed man here who wants to bring his ice cube bags to life. I can't say it enough but it would mean the world to me. 

If you believe in me then i'd be the worlds happiest guy if you donated for my campaign even just a small donation. I'm confident we can reach the 40,000$ with alot of believers. I really hope to raise this and bring you the best ice cube bag ever and I really hope you will share this with your friends if you find me interesting at all lol... Joke aside... It would mean alot if my campaign got that expossure! You can share it on facebook, instagram, twitter or merely use IndieGoGo's sharing tools.

Until now, it has been entirely up to wine producers to decide whether or not to </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">put their product in a box. Bottle2Box will change that. We'll take any bottle from any </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">producer, put it in a box, and ship it directly to your front door. And, we'll do all of this while </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">meeting or beating retail prices.</span></p><p><b>Why would you want wine in a box?</b> The short answer is: <i>flavor and longevity</i>. When <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">you open a bottle of wine, the flavor starts to degrade almost immediately. In a matter of </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">hours (perhaps days), the flavor will change so much that most people would consider it </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">spoiled. Sure, you can put the cork back in, use a stopper or even a fancy countertop </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">appliance to delay the change, but those don't measure up because ...</span></p><p><b>Wine boxes are different.</b> Your wine is actually stored in a sealed plastic bag inside the <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">box. This means that pouring a glass from a box isn't the same as opening a bottle. Once </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">the first glass is poured from a box, the rest of the wine stays sealed off. Because of the </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">limited exposure to atmosphere, your wine in the box will stay fresh for weeks, allowing you </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">to enjoy your wine at your own pace. There’s no need to finish it in hours, hook it up to an </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">expensive appliance, or throw away what isn't consumed.</span></p><p><b>But Don't Take Our Word For It:</b></p><p><a href=""http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/24/the-argument-for-boxed-wine/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://dinersjournal.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/24/the-argument-for-boxed-wine/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">NY Times: The Argument for Boxed Wine</a></p><p><a href=""http://winefolly.com/review/boxed-wine-benefits/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></a><a href=""http://winefolly.com/review/boxed-wine-benefits/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Winefolly: Are There Benefits to Boxed Wine?</a><br/></p><p></p><p><a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/katiebell/2013/02/18/the-best-in-boxed-wines-thinking-inside-the-box/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Forbes: The Best in Boxed Wine</a><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 38px;"">We Need to Build a Machine</span><br/></p><p>In order to deliver our product to anyone, we first need to build a machine to implement our patent-pending process.</p><p><b>Part of the machine already exists.</b> Because some producers already package their <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">wine in a box (like Franzia*, Bota*, Black Box*, etc.), we can buy the same machines they </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">use.

<p></p></div>","Bottle2Box: Your Wine on Your Time.Everyone who drinks wine has their favorite selections: specific vintages from specific producers. Until now, it has been entirely up to wine producers to decide whether or not to put their product in a box. Bottle2Box will change that. We'll take any bottle from any producer, put it in a box, and ship it directly to your front door. And, we'll do all of this while meeting or beating retail prices.Why would you want wine in a box? The short answer is: flavor and longevity. When you open a bottle of wine, the flavor starts to degrade almost immediately. In a matter of hours (perhaps days), the flavor will change so much that most people would consider it spoiled. Sure, you can put the cork back in, use a stopper or even a fancy countertop appliance to delay the change, but those don't measure up because ...Wine boxes are different. Your wine is actually stored in a sealed plastic bag inside the box. This means that pouring a glass from a box isn't the same as opening a bottle. Once the first glass is poured from a box, the rest of the wine stays sealed off. Because of the limited exposure to atmosphere, your wine in the box will stay fresh for weeks, allowing you to enjoy your wine at your own pace. There’s no need to finish it in hours, hook it up to an expensive appliance, or throw away what isn't consumed.But Don't Take Our Word For It:NY Times: The Argument for Boxed WineWinefolly: Are There Benefits to Boxed Wine?Forbes: The Best in Boxed WineWe Need to Build a MachineIn order to deliver our product to anyone, we first need to build a machine to implement our patent-pending process.Part of the machine already exists. Because some producers already package their wine in a box (like Franzia*, Bota*, Black Box*, etc.), we can buy the same machines they use. That technology is not proprietary. It's expensive, industrial-quality, food-safe machinery, but it's available nevertheless.Part of the machine is brand-new. Because no one is taking wine out of retail-ready bottles before putting into a box, that machinery doesn't exist. We have to start from scratch. Engineers will have to design it, and machinists will have to build it. However, this isn't ground-shattering, sci-fi-level technology; it's motors and levers and seals and pumps. In other words, the only challenge is paying for it.*Marks are the property of their respective owners.That's Where You Come InWith your help, we can order the existing parts and start the process of building the novel parts. Properly combined, the two parts of the Bottle2Box machine will allow us to start building a business. Meeting our fundraising goal will help us build a low-volume machine suitable for testing and limited order fulfillment. Exceeding our goal will get us closer to a high-volume machine which can deliver on orders from multiple states (and eventually the entire country, or even the world).MEMBERSHIP PERKS:

Day One Club: Every contributor to this campaign will be a member of the Day One Club. Membership includes a lifetime of exclusive offers and discounts.

Day One Elite: People who contribute $100 or more will receive all the benefits of Day One membership, plus custom-designed and exclusive packaging on all orders for life. 

Boxed Seats Club: People who contribute $1,000 or more will get all the benefits of Day One Elite membership, plus a spot-for-life on our special ""Thank You"" website page.

TOP STATE COMPETITION: The State which contributes the MOST MONEY to this campaign will be Bottle2Box's FIRST EXPANSION STATE. After we're up and running in Texas, your home state could be first in line.TOP DOG COMPETITION: The single largest contributor to this campaign will receive BOXES OF WINE AT COST FOR LIFE (see below). Furthermore, he or she will appear in our FIRST CELEBRITY VIDEO ENDORSEMENT.SOME RESTRICTIONS APPLY (Don't They Always):

The Twitter ""Thank You"" tweets will be paced so as to not drown out our other twitter messages, and will be posted in order of donation. As such, delivery date will vary.

Estimated Delivery Dates are only for non-alcoholic goods. 
All discounts on and deliveries of wine will only be available once Bottle2Box has been properly licensed in your state or country, and your age has been confirmed.
All perks are for personal, household use only. They are non-transferable.
The TOP DOG will be limited to 24 Boxes at cost per year. That's equivalent to 96 bottles.
Only states which allow the online purchase and delivery of wine are eligible for TOP STATE.
All personal information required for the delivery of perks will be provided by you. Should that information change before we can deliver, please inform us. 
The Challenge AheadBecause Bottle2Box is doing something new, there are a number of obstacles in our way. The first challenge involves safety and quality. Not only do we want our machine to be safe to operate, but it also needs to be safe to the consumer. This means using only tested and proven materials which can be quickly and effectively sanitized. The engineers who designed the existing parts have already thought of this. We'll have to replicate that thinking for the new parts.To make sure we get it right, Bottle2Box has already engaged the services of a former Food & Beverage industry executive, and we will work with qualified engineers to make sure our final product meets stringent safety standards. The second challenge will be legal compliance. This will come in two primary forms: food safety and liquor laws. Regarding food safety: after our engineers tell us the machine is safe, and after lab testing confirms it, we’ll have to convince various state and federal agencies of the same. Because what we’re doing is unique, these agencies will probably want to take an extra-close look to ensure we’re in line with the appropriate regulations. These thorough inspections will probably be time-consuming. Regarding liquor laws: every state has its own rules. Starting in Texas, we’ll have to find a way to fit our wine-repackaging service into an existing legal framework, one that currently views every business as a producer, distributor, or retailer. Bottle2Box might fall into all of these categories or none. Then we’ll have to take steps to comply with laws relating to the home-delivery of alcoholic beverages. This process will have to be repeated in every state, and eventually around the world.Fortunately, as a former political operative and currently licensed attorney, Sean Matula (creator of Bottle2Box) has both the skillset and network necessary to tackle these challenges. The final challenge will be managing growth. We know how big the wine industry is, we know how it’s changing, and we know how boxed wine currently fits into that picture. However, until we actually start selling boxes of wine, we’ll have no idea what kind of demand we’ll face. This means finding a careful balance between hoping for the best and planning for the worst. It also means that some of our earliest customers will be most exposed to our growing pains.To face this challenge, Bottle2Box will employ the latest technology and techniques from both the business and political arenas.

<h3>Are you ready to reignite the magic within? <i>Let's Duet!</i>
</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I am Lindsay, first and foremost I am the very proud mother of two beautiful children, Brayden (9) and Lillian (4). I am a passionate, dedicated and professional Entrepreneur originally from Naples, Maine and now located in Charlotte, North Carolina. I have seventeen years of restaurant experience. This includes working as a General Manager in corporate fine dining establishments as well as private clubs. I grew up highly involved in theatre and music, and have always possessed a love for the arts, and a fascination with uniquely artistic people. </p>
<p>I have started this campaign to raise money to open a restaurant with a new concept in South End Charlotte, NC. </p>
<p>Lets Duet will offer elegant cuisine in an eclectic atmosphere, designed completely by Charlotte artists. We combine fine dining with immersive art to provide an experience like no other! Using molecular gastronomy and mixology to create edible works of art, presented by our theatrical dining assistants who use tools to provide a unique sensory experience. </p>
<p>We have partnered with some of the city's most amazing artists to design the immersive art rooms, and host a different style of art class paired with a tasting menu every Friday to showcase and feature many different Charlotte artists and their unique style of art. </p>
<p>Lets Duet also will have a late-night, musical surprise called The Stagedoor. Just like in theatre, The Stagedoor is a hidden door that leads to a speakeasy style music bar that offers a unique upscale bar menu, open mic nights, poetry nights, and ""duet nights"". Duet nights will feature only pairs. Guests can bring their own partner or get blind partnered through our app. On Lets Duet's App there is an area to provide personal preference information that will match partners together. </p>
<p>This is mine and my son's dream. I love food, I love people, I love art, and I love kindness. I want to give back to my amazing community, I want to support unique artists and entrepreneurs on their quest to follow their dreams, but most of all, I want to show my children, and upcoming generations, that if we work hard, work together, share kindness, and give more than we take, together, we can achieve anything. </p>
<p>Change the mindset, change the world. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Lets Duet is looking to raise money through various avenues to come up with our initial start up cost of $1 million. </p>
<p>We hope to raise $200,000 through crowdfunding alone. This will be used to cover the down payment on our prospective location so we can begin building our dream!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal through Indiegogo we will continue to raise money through other avenues and save everything raised in our business account until we have what we need for start up costs.</p>
<p>For any backers we find through Indiegogo we will be sending a variety of thank you gifts such as: a personalized thank you letter explaining the impact they had on our business development, Lets Duet merchandise, unique art pieces created by one of our amazing artist partners, and pairs of tickets for ""an artistic dining experience"" once we are open!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Lets Duet will bring a new value to Charlotte. We will strive to bring together the community by supporting small business owners, entrepreneurs, and Charlotte's artists of all kinds!  We plan to support our community in every way we can. This includes: Rewarding employees for volunteering in the community, hosting different local charity events., donating annually to local charities, hosting and catering events for local small businesses, advertising for local businesses and artists, and partnering with the theatre and art community to provide an experience only to be found at Lets Duet. </p>
<p>Your contribution will make all the difference in the world to myself and my amazing team. Every amount we raise gets us one step closer to drawing back the curtains for opening night.  From then on we can work to make a difference in our community and then spread throughout the world. Sharing kindness and working hard, together, we can achieve anything. Change the mindset, change the world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always many risks and challenges to face when planning any business.  The food service industry is highly competitive. The U.S. restaurant industry includes over one million restaurants with combined annual revenue of about $700 billion in 2019. </p>
<p>The largest challenge we have is raising the money to get the business up and running.  Once open Lets Duet will face many threats such as: </p>
<p>•    Rising operating costs </p>
<p>•    Building &amp; maintaining sales volume</p>
<p>•    Popular, upscale restaurants nearby such as Ruth's Chris, Bardo, and The Capital Grille.</p>
<p>•    Increasing demand for food delivery services.</p>
<p>I believe we can overcome threats and challenges due to the following strengths:</p>
<p>•    I have an exceptional team with the can-do attitude. Combined over 60 years in the restaurant industry</p>
<p>•    Due to each of us having industry experience, we have already established a customer base and approved vendors</p>
<p>•    Due to our limited size, we believe we can provide exceptional quality by hand selecting our market specials when compared to our larger competitors</p>
<p>•    The same concept holds true in our staffing requirements, by hand selecting our employees we will strive to offer unsurpassed service when compared to our larger competitors</p>
<p>•    Lets Duet dining experience that is the first of it's kind in not only the city of Charlotte, but in the state of North Carolina.</p>
<p>•    Combining an immersive art experience with dining gives us more to offer than our average fine dining competitors. </p>
<p>•    Working with artists of all kinds allows us to consistently increase our customer base swiftly.</p>
<p>•    This also allows us to keep cost of decor low as we will be showcasing selling their art inside the restaurant. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>•    The more the merrier, you can join our team of creators!</p>
<p>•    We ask for you to please get the word out and make some noise about our campaign!</p>

</div></div>","Dear Backers,
Thank you for being a part of our incredible journey to bring Tiiable Awake to life. Before we launched, we didn’t know who else would be as excited about our idea as we were. Now, because of your support and the support of 1215 backers, we are moving onto the next phase of the project. In fact, we have already started discussing the specifics with the manufacturer and we should be able to share the delivery schedule with you within the next few weeks as the details are confirmed.
Our priority is to deliver on our commitments to you and we’ll keep you updated on our progress. As we hunker down to make Tiiable Awake a reality, you can expect to receive open, honest, & substantive updates from us monthly. Feel free to contact us at support@tiiabletea.com in the meantime if you have any questions. Thanks again for your support!
All the best,Tiiable Awake
 








         






   



AWAKE's manufacturing facility is similar to that of semiconductors, equipped with an aseptic cleanroom environment, where the source of contamination is completely removed. All functional natural ingredients comprising AWAKE, including Oriental Raisin Tree extract, turmeric, ginger, and many others are flash-sterilized by ultra-high temperature(UHT) processing, and are instantly chilled at room temperature. This ensures minimal loss of nutrients, and each ingredient's unique taste and aroma is kept intact. AWAKE is safely manufactured in the facility that has been awarded with ISO 9001, FSCC 22000, and HACCP Certification in accordance the international quality standards. 





AWAKE will start to ship from
September(late) or October, 
depending on manufacturing schedule.







You are what you drink. Yet, many people around the world are left without safe drinking water. This is also where TIIABLE is committed to make a difference. 
 
To that end, we will be donating five percent of our revenue from the indiegogo campaign to help alleviate the drinking water shortage problem around the world. That is not, however, where our mission ends, as we will continue to seek other ways to make our contribution.
 
Proper hydration is one of the key habits contributing to one's health and general well-being. Stick to that habit, and TIIABLE will deliver our unique blends of the best natural ingredients, more than water or any other beverages could.

<p>Nazareth has been producing delicious food through Delina for over five years now. She has produced her own brilliant range of dishes and was recognised by the Free From Awards with a gold, silver and bronze. This is nothing short of amazing given the competition was the likes of Marks and Spencer, Lidl and Tesco.</p>
<p>In addition to her amazing food, she has been running very popular cooking courses where groups can sample the amazing tastes and learn to make their own delicious food.</p>
<p>It is exciting times for Delina and now it is time to take a big step forward. Until now Delina has not had its own space to prepare food and teach, but a fantastic space has become available in the heart of Shepherds Bush - the Market. This will mean more delicious food, more cooking classes and also a cultural coffee experience from the very birthplace of coffee.</p> <p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Nazareth needs to raise funds for the set up costs of the new premises. She will need to install plumbing, electricity and workbenches along with purchasing kitchen equipment. She is looking for £5000 to cover all of this.</p>
<p>She is inviting you to help make this big step for her and be a part of this new stage for Delina. For generous backers she needs you to sponsor items she needs for the kitchen - fridges, sinks and benches. For this you will have your name permanently written in gold with a thank you on that item, and you will have Naz’s eternal gratitude.</p>
<p>For smaller donations Naz is also offering dinners, cooking classes and exclusive deals on her products.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>

<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>This is a huge step for Naz and she cannot do it without significant help from all of you. There is a big financial hurdle in front of her, but it is the only way to move forward in her business. The opportunity to grow is huge and after this hurdle is past we all know Delina will be a fantastic success because Naz has what it takes.</p>
</div></div>","Nazareth has been producing delicious food through Delina for over five years now. She has produced her own brilliant range of dishes and was recognised by the Free From Awards with a gold, silver and bronze. This is nothing short of amazing given the competition was the likes of Marks and Spencer, Lidl and Tesco.
In addition to her amazing food, she has been running very popular cooking courses where groups can sample the amazing tastes and learn to make their own delicious food.
It is exciting times for Delina and now it is time to take a big step forward. Until now Delina has not had its own space to prepare food and teach, but a fantastic space has become available in the heart of Shepherds Bush - the Market. This will mean more delicious food, more cooking classes and also a cultural coffee experience from the very birthplace of coffee. What We Need & What You Get
Nazareth needs to raise funds for the set up costs of the new premises. She will need to install plumbing, electricity and workbenches along with purchasing kitchen equipment. She is looking for £5000 to cover all of this.
She is inviting you to help make this big step for her and be a part of this new stage for Delina. For generous backers she needs you to sponsor items she needs for the kitchen - fridges, sinks and benches. For this you will have your name permanently written in gold with a thank you on that item, and you will have Naz’s eternal gratitude.
For smaller donations Naz is also offering dinners, cooking classes and exclusive deals on her products.
The Impact
Your help at this point will finally take Delina to the next stage and Nazareth will be able to give you all the range of food and experiences you have all been asking for. Until now it has been hard to produce enough of her products and deliver classes in a professional environment. The new space will open the door for Naz to offer so much more too - Ethiopian coffee ceremony, bespoke spice blends and launching new products.
Risks & Challenges
This is a huge step for Naz and she cannot do it without significant help from all of you. There is a big financial hurdle in front of her, but it is the only way to move forward in her business. The opportunity to grow is huge and after this hurdle is past we all know Delina will be a fantastic success because Naz has what it takes.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

How often are you going to get the chance to say to your friends that you brewed your own beer at a commercial brewery and it has been drunk by hundreds of people across the land?

And if they need posting, well we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.</p><h2><strong>What happens if we don’t raise enough money?</strong></h2><p>In the unfortunate event that we don’t find enough people to contribute to our campaign, the money raised will be directed to the items of equipment listed. The raw materials while a large initial outlay for us will eventually recoup their costs when they're sold. The equipment however is more difficult to finance.

If the Fownes Brewing Co produces such wonderful beer, surely it’s making lots of money and can fund bottling itself?</p><p>That would be a wonderful position to be in, but we’re not. Even now the physical volume of beer we produce is still very small compared to a lot of breweries and the profit doesn’t allow us to invest in big purchases like the ones proposed in this campaign.

We know we’ve got something special that needs to reach a wider audience but we need our fans to lend us a hand, show us they believe in what we’re doing and show the world why they are right.</p><h2><strong>I’m sold!

If the crown cap isn’t on correctly then the beer is going to lose carbonation and maybe even leak! Professional bottling machine, allowing us to fill more bottles at a time: £2300This is the big ticket item. A high quality stainless steel syphon filling machine is ideal for the bottle conditioned ales we're aiming to produce. With six filling heads this piece of kit will allow us to fill three times as many bottles at a time as we currently can.  What do I get out of all of this?The most important and priceless thing that you will get is the life long gratitude of the Dwarfs (worth approximately 300 years of gratitude, none transferable.) Oh, and you'll also get some beer.We’ve put together some great perks that we’re thrilled about sharing with you. A Case of Dwarfen AleThis is the main perk that we want you to walk away with. It will look beautiful and taste amazing. Here’s what to expect:16 bottles of our finest ales, presented in our custom designed box, containing: Frost Hammer4.6% Pale AlePale, like a winters morn.

Tour de force of malt.Epic ales are not simply plucked from thin air, and Master Brewer Broddr Firebeard is not ashamed to let folk know how much hard work went into perfecting his eponymous ale!A diverse malt bill adds layers of complexity and depth to this wondrous crimson ale, all tied together by a subtle, fruity hop profile.x3 bottles.King Korvak's Saga5.4% PorterEpically dark, rich & smooth. Chocolate & roast.A prince, a prophecy and a shadow from the East. Hear ye now the tale of poor King Korvak…Our signature porter, celebrated and awarded across the Midlands as the finest porter in the land. The complex roast and coffee flavours are suitably balanced by it’s bitterness and subtle earthy hop flavours.x3 bottles.Visions of Heresy 5.7% Smoked Rye IPASmoke clears, rye appears, descends into hoppy madness.The prophecies of Korvak’s youth are being fulfilled, but who will betray him?Combining the spice of rye with a subtle smokiness, the rich depth of maltiness of this ale is complimented by big fruity, floral and citrus hop flavours.x3 bottles.Hand of Doom 8.2% DIPABe led away to a world of bitterness & citrus ruination.As the Troll Wars grind to a stalemate, an ancient and devastating weapon will change the course of history.Everything about this beer is big, from it’s effect on the Troll Wars down to it’s big malt backbone which supports a big bitterness and more hops than in any of our other beers.

Bold. Complex.All sagas must end, but not all endings are happy. As the Troll Wars come to a head, the Dwarfs are caught off guard by a bold assault directly against the Ulfsburg.What better way to bring the saga to a close than with a monstrous 9.0% Baltic variation on our porters. Blending seven different malts to deliver a bold and complex flavour with hidden depths of roast, coffee, chocolate and smoke.x2 bottles.All of our bottled beers are bottle conditioned and vegan friendly. They are unfiltered, unpasteurised, living creatures and should be treated with care and respect. But mainly drunk. Delightful Dwarfen Discount CardWe know some of you won’t be able to get enough of our bottled beers. You may even want to share them with others who don’t yet know how fantastic Dwarfen Ale is. So this perk is a big deal. With your Delightful Dwarfen Discount card you get an Epic 20% saving on all bottle beer bought directly from us at the brewery.That's the equivalent of 3 free bottles in every case you buy.  You’d save £8.83 on a case of the award winning King Korvak's Saga, which adds up to over £100 if you bought a case a month during the twelve months its valid.Throughout the year we'll have 16 different beers available in bottle including our Core, Special, Limited and Saga Editions. Some of these will be exclusively available in bottles and you'll get first refusal on all of them.Dwarfen Goblets and T-shirtsWant to show your love and represent the Fownes Brewery when out in the world? This perk is for you.Exclusive to this campaign, this single print run of newly designed t-shirts will feature the artwork from our boxes. We will have previews of the t-shirt during the campaign.Our new Dwarfen Goblets will be specially selected 2/3 pint glasses, lavishly decorated and perfect for enjoying a bottle of Fownes ale. Mock ups will be featured during updates of the campaign. (Men's and women's fit t-shirts will be available in a range of sizes. We'll contact you once the campaign is running to ask your preference.)A Brewery TourThis is one of the big ones. You and five friends will come to the brewery for some one on one time with the brewer, Tom. He’ll tell you all about the Dwarfs and their sagas while James explains about the brewing process. You’ll get chance to see, smell and touch all the raw ingredients while drinking plenty of samples. James will be in touch to arrange for a date that suits you and your friends.Brewer for a DayIt’s not often we let people into the brewery to help out. But you could be one of the lucky few. When you’ve finished your hard day's work we’ll give you the fruits of your labour to have in a cask for an event of your choice. How often are you going to get the chance to say to your friends that you brewed your own beer at a commercial brewery and it has been drunk by hundreds of people across the land? James will get in touch to arrange a mutually agreeable date for you to come to the brewery, and Tom will work with you to develop a recipe.How will you get the Perks to me?You're going to have to come to us I'm afraid. But it's okay, we'll shake your hand, maybe even give you a hug and a cup of tea to show our appreciation. If we can get enough people together at the same time we might even have a bit of a knees up. If you can't get to us and you're local we'll endeavour to deliver the perks to you. And if they need posting, well we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.What happens if we don’t raise enough money?In the unfortunate event that we don’t find enough people to contribute to our campaign, the money raised will be directed to the items of equipment listed. The raw materials while a large initial outlay for us will eventually recoup their costs when they're sold. The equipment however is more difficult to finance. Your contribution will go towards providing us with the tools to produce bottled beer for years to come.Why do you need my help?That’s a great question. If the Fownes Brewing Co produces such wonderful beer, surely it’s making lots of money and can fund bottling itself?That would be a wonderful position to be in, but we’re not. Even now the physical volume of beer we produce is still very small compared to a lot of breweries and the profit doesn’t allow us to invest in big purchases like the ones proposed in this campaign. Most of the time the money we make goes into incremental improvements in the brewhouse to consistently improve the quality of the beer we produce and replace ageing equipment.By helping us you’re making a huge impact on a small business. We know we’ve got something special that needs to reach a wider audience but we need our fans to lend us a hand, show us they believe in what we’re doing and show the world why they are right.I’m sold! How else can I help?We wouldn’t have made it this far if it wasn’t for our fans spreading the word about the great beers we produce and the stories we tell. And now we need you to do it again. Please share this campaign, shout about it, write about it, tell everyone who trusts your opinion and you think would like to be a part of the Fownes Brewery’s latest adventure.  Thank you,James & Thomas Fownes",18.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Hi, I’m Marissa Joy Flynn and yes,
Ice Cream Joy is named after me!  I live
in Lakewood, Ohio and no longer want to drive out of this beautiful city to go
somewhere and buy some super extra delicious small batch homemade ice cream.  Plus, my freezer at home is too small to store all of my different flavors all the time and I love a good variety!  I get joy out of sharing the ice cream that I make using simple ingredients that people know how to spell and don’t have to look
up in a dictionary.  I have noticed for a
while that this city, and especially Madison Avenue, is in need of a cute little artisan ice cream shop and that is
exactly what I intend to put in.  I even
found a great place for it, right next to an adorable candy and brownie shop,
what could be better?!  This campaign
will help make this awesome dream a reality. 
The space is not already set up as a kitchen, so I have a lot of work to
do to be ready in time for opening in the spring! </span><br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With your contributions, I will be
able to pay for plumbing, electrical, flooring, paint, a dipping cabinet, a
commercial fridge and freezer, and so much more!  This will be pretty expensive and I am
starting my campaign out at $15,000 to try to obtain funding for at least the first chunk of what I need to do here.  If I happen to raise $45,000, that would be amazing and I should be able to do everything I need to open the store!  </p>
<p>In return for
your generous contributions, you can get some really awesome perks!  Every contributor will get a punch card good
for the number of scoops or pints of ice cream listed (this varies by amount
contributed) and can be used for up to a year after the store’s grand
opening.  People who are able to donate
more can also get an Ice Cream Joy shirt, messenger bag, or both.  And, if you are able to contribute even more,
you can even be an official taste tester for a year, get an ice cream party,
and/or get to help develop your own favorite flavor!  The more you contribute and the more you share with your
friends so they can contribute, the better positioned I will be for a great
opening where you can enjoy some really delicious ice cream.  And, as much as I would love to
reach my entire goal, if it doesn’t happen, I will still use every dollar you
contribute to make this store a reality and will stretch it all as far as I can!</p>

</div><div style=""""> <p></p>
<p>Ice Cream Joy is already a small
business located in Cleveland, Ohio offering artisan flavors of ice cream using
local milk and cream from happy grass-eating cows, fresh fruit sorbets and
ices, and creamy dreamy delicious vegan flavors.  Currently, we sell pre-portioned scoops at <a href=""http://www.susysoup.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Susy's Soup</a> in Tower City downtown.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On a personal note... I seem to have
a near obsession with making stuff from scratch. So, I don't just go to the
store, buy a mix of pre-made stuff, put it in my machine, and out comes artisan
ice cream and sorbet.  I take the time to find the right real ingredients and
mix them together myself to have the best flavor possible. I don't add
preservatives (unless you count sugar) or fillers and I produce in super small
batches.  I'm proud to be from Cleveland and Ohio and will work more and more
over time to buy local from the awesome people in this great urban area and
wonderful state.  And the more I can buy local, the better: it helps the environment to have food travel less and it helps the local economy thrive!</p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>Starting a business is always
risky.  Things do not always work the way
I plan or hope for, but that does not mean I give up.  Just the opposite, each hurdle I face pushes
me harder to achieve my goals.  My
persistence and perseverance even in the face of obstacles allows me to make
things happen.  And I am more than
willing to adjust my goals and work with others as needed to make this work
(e.g. modifying flavors, adjusting store plans for government regulation, etc.).  </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
</div>
<p>Even if you are not able to
contribute financially, I could really use your help to get the word out to
your friends and their friends!  Feel
free to use the Indiegogo share tools, broadcast this crowdfunding campaign on
social media, or talk to people about what I am doing to help me make this
store a reality!</p><p>
Also,
if you live in the area and happen to have some furniture that you want to get
rid of, I would be happy to look at it and see if it would work within the
store!<br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>Perk FAQs</h3><p></p><p>
</p><p><i>Can I get my rewards
before the store opens?</i></p>
<p>Yes
and no… I can get you your punch cards and apparel before the store opens, but
you would need to wait for the store to open before you can get the ice cream,
sorry!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1107015/files/20141219074708-1982047_10152400601270566_2304929865260179734_n.jpg?1419004028"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p><i>What do you get as a
taste tester?  </i></p>
<p>In
addition to the scoops listed, you will get to try each and every new flavor
when it is made.  We will set aside a
mini scoop for you for each one.  You
will be notified when they are made so you can come in.  Oh, and did I mention that since you likely
have never tried any of the flavors, you will have to catch up a lot at the
beginning (or choose to spread it out over time)!</p>
<p><i>I don’t live near
Lakewood, Ohio; how can I get my rewards?</i></p>
<p>You
have to physically come into the store to get the ice cream, sorry, I am not
shipping ice cream at this time (kind of defeats the local movement)!!! </p>
<p><i>I don’t live near
Lakewood, Ohio; can I give my rewards to someone else?</i></p>
<p>Absolutely!  Any of the perks you get can be given as gifts!  </p>
<p><i>Can I redeem my reward
for cash later?  </i></p>
<p>Sorry,
the rewards are not redeemable for cash.</p>
<p><i>Whoa, how do I help
develop my favorite flavor?</i></p>
<p>This
will be an evolving thing that we figure out together.  My initial thought is that I will have you
come into the store, we can start with a discussion of the foods you like to
eat, you can try the flavors I have, and we can come up with something together
to try out.  Since it might not be 100%
right the first time, we can try up to 2 more times.  You can have the entire batch of ice cream
that we make each time (minus a small tasting fee for me!), the recipe, and
lots of fun!  Also, I fully plan to make
at least one batch of the final product to sell at the store and will continue
with it if it does well!</p>
<p><i>What kind of messenger
bag and shirts are there?</i></p>
<p>It
is an Authentic Pigment-Dyed Canvas Field Bag.  There are different shirts available for men, women, and youth (I will get information from you as to which style and size you want).  Each one has the “I &lt;3 JOY” take on
the logo shown below.</p>

shipping ice cream at this time (kind of defeats the local movement)!!! 
I don’t live near
Lakewood, Ohio; can I give my rewards to someone else?
Absolutely!  Any of the perks you get can be given as gifts!  
Can I redeem my reward
for cash later?  
Sorry,
the rewards are not redeemable for cash.
Whoa, how do I help
develop my favorite flavor?
This
will be an evolving thing that we figure out together.  My initial thought is that I will have you
come into the store, we can start with a discussion of the foods you like to
eat, you can try the flavors I have, and we can come up with something together
to try out.  Since it might not be 100%
right the first time, we can try up to 2 more times.  You can have the entire batch of ice cream
that we make each time (minus a small tasting fee for me!), the recipe, and
lots of fun!  Also, I fully plan to make
at least one batch of the final product to sell at the store and will continue
with it if it does well!
What kind of messenger
bag and shirts are there?
It
is an Authentic Pigment-Dyed Canvas Field Bag.  There are different shirts available for men, women, and youth (I will get information from you as to which style and size you want).  Each one has the “I <3 JOY” take on
the logo shown below.
Do the perks expire?
Yes,
the perks will expire a year after the store opens, or March 31, 2016,
whichever comes later.What happens if the store never opens?This is not going to happen!  Since I am a realist and I know that you might be concerned, I will also say that even if something goes horribly horrendously wrong, your perks will still be fulfilled 100%, even if I have to drive ice cream to people's homes!Other FAQsWhat does the character 樂in the logo stand for?It translates to joy, more specifically to being happy, glad, amused, or cheerful or that something is enjoyable or fun.  All of these remind me of eating ice cream!Where will the store be located?I just signed the lease for 15210 Madison Avenue in Lakewood, Ohio.  This spot just so happens to be next door to a gourmet brownie and chocolate store, Fear's Confections, that is completely awesome.  And that store is right next door to Elmwood Bakery, where we got our wedding cake!  It has been called a Trifecta of Sweets by a few people now, just based on the delicious idea!Do you have other plans for the store?That's a fantastic question!  I have a ton of plans including incorporating art with the artisan ice cream, flavor passports, warm drinks and potentially made-to-order artisan soft pretzels for the cold months, a kids area, collaborating with my dessert-dishing neighbors, and so much more.  Follow Ice Cream Joy on FaceBook and Twitter or keep an eye on the website to see how everything else shapes up!Is it good?It is delicious!  Every time I try a flavor that I make I am amazed by how good it tastes!  You will definitely empty your bowl!

                    Oh no, your campaign expired and I didn't get to take advantage of your great perks!  Can I still order them?Send me an email at iScreamJoy@gmail.com and we can figure something out.  If the store is already open, come on in!Your ice cream sounds amazing, when will you be open?!?!Yay!  Thanks for the compliment and for asking!  I hope to open by the spring of 2015 and will definitely be open by the summer of 2015!!!!  If you just cannot wait to try some of these awesome flavors, some of them are already available at Susy's Soup in Tower City downtown (same level as the food court, opposite end, near the lower indoor entrance to the casino).  Check the website for flavors!What will the store look like?If you're a good artist, don't look too closely and find all my drawing flaws...  Here's the plan so far!",6.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Our names are Merelis and Ysanet, and we are Woke Foods -- a women-owned cooperative that taps into the healing traditions of Dominican food! We are NYC’s first Dominican vegan food business and we cater events, create and share recipes on our website, host cooking classes, and soon will offer meal planning. We love food, specifically Dominican food, and wholeheartedly believe that food is our medicine! Woke Foods is the way we bring nutritious foods to our people. We talk about our collective ancestral connection to food, and share vegan and vegetarian Dominican food practices with our community. Since creating Woke Foods we see and experience the need for socially conscious, nutritious, and culturally respectful foods made by us and for us. We are clear on how politics deeply influences our personal lives, particularly our relationship with food and the land. Our vision is to reconnect people with the knowledge they already have within themselves to nourish themselves and our communities in a way that honors our Mother Earth. <i>We have created this crowdfunding campaign to expand our current team and get our business off the ground to better serve all of you. </i>We are truly grateful for all the love we have received from you all these past few weeks and look forward to what we get to create together!</p> <h3>Background</h3> <p>In May 2016, Ysanet quit her non-profit job to focus more on work that addresses racism and systems of oppression, shortly after Woke Foods was born. Ysanet who had been cooking for most of her life, began to see the intersection of food, health, and race, and how our current food system was negatively impacting the health of our black and brown communities. Woke Foods began to address these issues by offering food that was healthy and culturally relevant in the form of meal planning and catering. As Woke Foods was embraced by these communities, the need for this work became increasingly apparent and necessary. When the opportunity to enroll in Green Workers Cooperative Co-op Academy, a development program that guides and aides people of color to launch cooperative businesses, Ysanet immediately thought of an ideal business partner to grow the business, Merelis Catalina Ortiz. For several years, Merelis worked in food justice, facilitating cooking classes, studying traditional Dominican food practices, and developing relationships with gardeners, farmers and food educators. In 2015, Merelis and Ysanet connected at a women’s circle gathering in Washington Heights. They quickly realized their shared values and interests for community, self-love, love for black and brown people, and a commitment to using food as a tool for liberation. Together, Merelis and Ysanet have developed the business and vision to create what Woke Foods is today.</p> <p>In Febraury 2017, Woke Foods graduated from Green Workers Cooperative’ Co-op Academy, and formed as a green cooperative business. This piece is important to Woke Foods because the business is part of a movement that is much larger than themselves. A movement working towards food sovereignty (where all people exercise the right to control our own food systems), building a strong local economy within the Bronx and Northern Manhattan rooted in democracy and environmental justice.</p> <h3>WHY DO WE NEED YOUR SUPPORT?</h3> <p>In the past year, we have accomplished more than we imagined. This includes:</p> <ul>
<li>Catering for over a dozen events</li>
<li>Facilitating cooking classes online and in-person</li>
<li>Selling foods, through our Food Pop-Ups, at events throughout the five boroughs of NYC</li>

<li>Pulling all our resources together! We have used our limited savings, food stamps, and generous support from our family, friends, and community to bring this business into fruition</li>
</ul> <p>We recognize that for Woke Foods to meet the demands of our people, we need a bigger team with the skills and knowledge to offer more cooking classes, catering services, and meal planning services throughout the Bronx, Northern Manhattan, and eventually the rest of New York City. We plan to expand our current team of 2 to a team of 10 people by the end of the year. In order to do this, we need your support! The money raised will go to the following:</p>

<p>As I was growing up, my mom had the most beautiful vegetable garden in our backyard. She grew everything from carrots, potatoes, tomatoes, celery, onion, you name it! She loved learning about what crops to grow, companion planting, and pest management. Year after year, she'd get a good bounty of carrots! In fact, I would not eat them unless they were grown by my mom. Over the years, her love for growing food continued, but as life got busy and her kids began busy lives, she stopped growing in her vegetable garden and focussed on her flowers, storing away her love and passion for vegetables.</p>
<p>With the bounty of her backyard garden and trips to her favourite vendors at the market, mom had a passion for canning and preserving food. Some of the fondest memories I have of my mom are strawberry picking, visiting Stryck's Farm, and celebrating my birthday traditon of apple picking each year! She'd preserve an abundance of pickles, green tomato relish, pickled beets, strawberry jam, apple sauce, and peaches! Some years, she would even shuck peas by hand, blanch them, and freeze them. Mom loved to make food for her family, but most of all, she loved to see the smiling faces as people enjoyed her food. She would often send friends and family jars of preserves home.</p>
<p>Two years ago, mom moved to my brother's farm and began to grow a larger garden there. Seeing her in the garden again was one of the most incredible feelings in the world. She was so happy and proud of the food she grew and was even more so excited to share it with everyone around her! We began to dream of starting a mobile certified kitchen to do all of her preserves with farm-fresh vegetables from both her garden and our veggies at Wayward Farm. This way, we could share the love and bounty she grew with even more people.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, in summer of 2021, mom was diagnosed with stage 4 kidney cancer. Her energy was low and she wasn't able to get in her garden to grow her vegetables. Some of mom's friends were able to help! They planted half of her garden with corn, squash, beans, potatoes, pickling cucumbers, beets, tomatoes, pumpkins, onions, and peppers. All in hopes that mom would be able to spend time in the garden, tending, harvesting, and doing her favourite part, preserving. As quickly as things grew, mom's health declined. She spent a lot of time by the garden, but didn't get the opportunity to make any preserves before passing away on September 4th, 2021.<br/><br/>In honour of my mom, I would like to plant a perennial garden with apple trees, rhubarb, strawberries, raspberries, asparagus, and a large perennial herb garden. I hope to continue her traditions with my daughters, inspiring them to grow their own food, preserve it, and share it as much as possible!</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Tacos &amp; Tequila<br/>BBQ &amp; Bourbon</h3>
<p>Hello Friends, I am Sean Hopkins.<br/>You can call me ""Hoppy"".</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553896385/x0fscmo6zhc6w4uzbtsn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I just love Food, Fun, Family and Friends, and connecting the dots from my passions to people is everything I'm all about.  Since I can't just have everyone over to the house for Tacos &amp; BBQ . . . I'm trying to bring this passion to the People of my hometown of Amesbury, Massachusetts. <br/><br/>I've got some super tasty TEX-MEX treats in mind, like bodacious beef ribs, that go way beyond your typical taco joint and I can't wait to share them with you!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553900275/ql335go62au8zo6eptf3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>See . . . I ran a successful restaurant in New Hampshire for the last 8 years and recently closed up shop in order to focus on opening Hoppy's Cantina in a historic building in downtown Amesbury. </p>
<p>When we closed our doors we found jobs for our key people, and got to say ""Thank you very much"" to many of our loyal friends with a wonderful farewell party.  We closed up right and I'm really proud.  Though it was hard to close something I worked so hard on for 8+ years . . . I knew I had to do it if I wanted to make my Taco &amp; BBQ Dream come true here in Amesbury. <br/><br/>So here we are ready to make it ""Hoppen"" and I gotta tell you, I really love living in Amesbury.  I am thrilled to become a vibrant part of the community and our future. I'm looking forward to furthering the relationships we've already established within The 'Bury and want to be a part of making Amesbury a destination!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553800838/xdsavvgrir7oos31ccjq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><br/>Here's where you can help.  The building we're going into is a small charming brick and morter space with beautiful floor to ceiling windows.  We're right in the down town rotary section with a great view of the down town area, in walking distance of so many friends and businesses . . . our space is great but really needs some work.  Your contributions will help Hoppy's Cantina Bring Tacos to the People!<br/><br/>What do we need your help with?</p>
<ul>
<li>BUILD A BETTER BAR<br/>There is currently a bar in place, but it is very small with only 6 usable bar stools with no back rests. We're going to have to totally break down and remove the old bar. Naturally, we will be redesigning a bigger and better bar with new materials. We're designing a centralized horseshoe-shaped bar with approximately 20 stools with backs and maybe a dozen taps to compliment our Tequila, Bourbon and Margarita selection.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553800733/ce5vsw8z0hv5rmmdjn2a.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </li>
<li>DESIGN A KILLER KITCHEN<br/>With a Tex-Mex menu in mind, We're going to totally need to redesign the kitchen. We're going to have to bring in some specialized equipment (like a smoker and buffalo chopper) because we want to offer some really unique things like authentic low and slow smoked BBQ along with Fresh Salsa and unique Tex-Mex treats like Gator Bites and Sausage bombs!  As with any kitchen refresh, you never know what we're going to find when we dig into it.<br/> </li>
<li>INVIGORATE THE INTERIOR<br/>We really love this space and think it can be amazing! Since we're totally rebuilding the bar, we have the opportunity to do some super cool things like reinvigorate the brick walls, give the floor a new treatment and implement a brand new Sound, Paint &amp; Light scheme. We want this place to feel like you're on vacation, so we're really going for A VIBE which is very much Key West, Austin Texas, Cancun and Jamaica. It's going to take a lot of work, and we're totally stoked about it!<br/> </li>
<li>FRESHEN THE FACADE<br/>This is the simplest part of what we're doing. This charming old building built in the 1800's could use a face lift, And we want you to feel Warm and ""Hoppy"" when you walk into our little ol' Taco Joint.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for checking out Hoppy's Cantina Campaign.  Now let's make it ""Hoppen""!</p>

<ul>
<li>BUILDING A BETTER BAR<ul>
<li>Remove old bar.</li>

Hello Friends, I am Sean Hopkins.You can call me ""Hoppy"".

I just love Food, Fun, Family and Friends, and connecting the dots from my passions to people is everything I'm all about.  Since I can't just have everyone over to the house for Tacos & BBQ . . . I'm trying to bring this passion to the People of my hometown of Amesbury, Massachusetts. I've got some super tasty TEX-MEX treats in mind, like bodacious beef ribs, that go way beyond your typical taco joint and I can't wait to share them with you!

See . . . I ran a successful restaurant in New Hampshire for the last 8 years and recently closed up shop in order to focus on opening Hoppy's Cantina in a historic building in downtown Amesbury. 
When we closed our doors we found jobs for our key people, and got to say ""Thank you very much"" to many of our loyal friends with a wonderful farewell party.  We closed up right and I'm really proud.  Though it was hard to close something I worked so hard on for 8+ years . . . I knew I had to do it if I wanted to make my Taco & BBQ Dream come true here in Amesbury. So here we are ready to make it ""Hoppen"" and I gotta tell you, I really love living in Amesbury.  I am thrilled to become a vibrant part of the community and our future. I'm looking forward to furthering the relationships we've already established within The 'Bury and want to be a part of making Amesbury a destination!

Here's where you can help.  The building we're going into is a small charming brick and morter space with beautiful floor to ceiling windows.  We're right in the down town rotary section with a great view of the down town area, in walking distance of so many friends and businesses . . . our space is great but really needs some work.  Your contributions will help Hoppy's Cantina Bring Tacos to the People!What do we need your help with?

BUILD A BETTER BARThere is currently a bar in place, but it is very small with only 6 usable bar stools with no back rests. We're going to have to totally break down and remove the old bar. Naturally, we will be redesigning a bigger and better bar with new materials. We're designing a centralized horseshoe-shaped bar with approximately 20 stools with backs and maybe a dozen taps to compliment our Tequila, Bourbon and Margarita selection. 
DESIGN A KILLER KITCHENWith a Tex-Mex menu in mind, We're going to totally need to redesign the kitchen. We're going to have to bring in some specialized equipment (like a smoker and buffalo chopper) because we want to offer some really unique things like authentic low and slow smoked BBQ along with Fresh Salsa and unique Tex-Mex treats like Gator Bites and Sausage bombs!  As with any kitchen refresh, you never know what we're going to find when we dig into it. 
INVIGORATE THE INTERIORWe really love this space and think it can be amazing! Since we're totally rebuilding the bar, we have the opportunity to do some super cool things like reinvigorate the brick walls, give the floor a new treatment and implement a brand new Sound, Paint & Light scheme. We want this place to feel like you're on vacation, so we're really going for A VIBE which is very much Key West, Austin Texas, Cancun and Jamaica. It's going to take a lot of work, and we're totally stoked about it! 
FRESHEN THE FACADEThis is the simplest part of what we're doing. This charming old building built in the 1800's could use a face lift, And we want you to feel Warm and ""Hoppy"" when you walk into our little ol' Taco Joint.

Thanks for checking out Hoppy's Cantina Campaign.  Now let's make it ""Hoppen""!

*** Look at that smoked Scotch Egg with the runny Yolk! Yum!!!


What We Need & What You Get

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Story</h3>
<p>Brad Lazarenko the founder and Executive Chef de Cuisine of the Culina Family of Restaurants, is a self-taught chef with a Metis background. His first restaurant, the 45-seat bistro ‘Culina’ (the root word for culinary) opened in Edmonton’s beautiful Millcreek neighbourhood in 2004. With excellent reviews, Culina introduced Edmonton to Brad’s philosophy of offering quality and affordable comfort food featuring local suppliers and producers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578788544/hxjka1uawmwtkdiji5ku.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In 2015, Brad brought this philosophy into the River Valley by renovating and  operating the cafe at Victoria golf course. A successful and well-received endeavour, Brad's vision was then expanded to include cafes and restaurants at a number of City of Edmonton-run facilities including ACT Centre at Rundle Park and The Riverside Golf Course. Despite the popularity of the local cafes, in 2018, Culina Restaurants lost the bid to renew for the river valley spaces to a much larger, corporate competitor. Now only two years later, the corporation has left town and there is an opportunity to bring local food back to the river valley at Hawrelak Park.  <br/>                                                 </p>
<p>                                  <u><i>We're game...but we need your help to do it.</i></u></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578788568/gy47gognfnu01r3tfgra.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><br/>Culina on the Lake will be a community space where we can all enjoy local fare, skillfully prepared within the beautiful backdrop of Hawrelak Park. We want to be the meeting place for family meals after a day of skating, where friends catch up after work and a place to refuel while enjoying the river valley with all its festivals and attractions.

</div></div>","Our Story
Brad Lazarenko the founder and Executive Chef de Cuisine of the Culina Family of Restaurants, is a self-taught chef with a Metis background. His first restaurant, the 45-seat bistro ‘Culina’ (the root word for culinary) opened in Edmonton’s beautiful Millcreek neighbourhood in 2004. With excellent reviews, Culina introduced Edmonton to Brad’s philosophy of offering quality and affordable comfort food featuring local suppliers and producers.

In 2015, Brad brought this philosophy into the River Valley by renovating and  operating the cafe at Victoria golf course. A successful and well-received endeavour, Brad's vision was then expanded to include cafes and restaurants at a number of City of Edmonton-run facilities including ACT Centre at Rundle Park and The Riverside Golf Course. Despite the popularity of the local cafes, in 2018, Culina Restaurants lost the bid to renew for the river valley spaces to a much larger, corporate competitor. Now only two years later, the corporation has left town and there is an opportunity to bring local food back to the river valley at Hawrelak Park.                                                   
                                  We're game...but we need your help to do it.

Culina on the Lake will be a community space where we can all enjoy local fare, skillfully prepared within the beautiful backdrop of Hawrelak Park. We want to be the meeting place for family meals after a day of skating, where friends catch up after work and a place to refuel while enjoying the river valley with all its festivals and attractions. During the summer months we invite our neighbours to join us for lakeside sunsets with fresh food and beverage or to grab one of our picnic baskets to enjoy the park even more. We also intend to utilize this unique space by hosting cultural events, yoga, paddleboarding and much more. 
                        We want this to be yours as much as much as it is ours. 

Why Indiegogo?
When a good opportunity presents itself you have to move. We would love to be able to simply jump in and start a new venture like Culina on the Lake but for us, like most, that is not the case. Some capital will be required to get up and running. We will need to purchase equipment, furniture, signage and a little bit of marketing to make sure everyone knows were there. Lastly, since we not only support local food but local art as well, we will have a mural installed on the building by a local artist to mark it as ours. That's it, and we will be sharing each development with you on the way so that you know where your dollars are going. 

Will this work?
Of course. Culina Restaurants has an exemplary track record when it comes to creating spaces for local food and gatherings in the river valley. Successful, well reviewed establishments that the Culina Family of Restaurants have created in the past include:
          - Dogwood Cafe at the Victoria Golf Course
          - Dogwood Cafe at the Riverside Riverside Golf Course
          - Dogwood Cafe at the Rundle Golf Course and Rundle ACT Centre.
          - Culina Muttart Cafe
          - Culina Mill Creek
          - Bibo Wine Bar
Lessons learned from operating these establishments and decades of restaurant industry experience put Culina Family of Restaurant's in an ideal position to meet and surpass expectations on the lake at Hawrelak Park. 

I love the idea but can't afford it.
We appreciate you taking the time to learn about our new endeavour. We also understand that it's not always possible to contribute financially to a new idea but that doesn't mean you can't help. If you like our idea of a new, locally sourced space in Hawrelak Park you can still show your support by:
- Sharing our campaign on your social media networks. (facebook, instagram, twitter, etc)
- Signing up for our newsletter to keep informed and sharing with your friends.

<h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3>
<p><strong>I'm Steven L. Liebenhaut of steveNyou Presents. I've been organizing events and raising funds for local nonprofits in need for over 5 years and have raised over $30,000 so far. Recently some of my friends suggested I create a BOD and capitalize on the efforts of many instead of just mine, creating  a more vast, positive and meaninful effect on our community.</strong></p>
<p><strong>After learning of The FARM CAFE.org in Boone, NC and meeting with them and Denise Cerrera of One World Everybody Eats Foundation, we decided to research the possibilities of opening a nonprofit restaurant here in Asheville offering volunteer opportunities within our community to learn a new skill, and help create more jobs in our ever growing city. We plan to provide a full service, fresh cooked meal, at an affordable price. </strong></p>
<p><strong>We need to attend the The 4th Annual One World Everybody Eats Nonprofit Food Summit in New Brunswick,NJ on January 18-21, 2013. There we'll meet over 150 people from around the country who have either already opened nonprofit restaurants or will be, like us, in the near future.  We're just now to the beginning stages of our fundraising campaign but now we need your help in getting to New Brunswick, NJ next month.</strong></p>

<h3>Why</h3>
<p>We can't sell wine without constructing a small barn that can appropriately be licensed, but we've come a long way already planting a vineyard and setting up equipment. Please support us in getting across the finish line!</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Spotted cows dot the surrounding landscape, and, so do the grapes! It's a return to a way of life that's good and wholesome, and, Skaneateles otherwise seemed a bit left-out of the Finger Lakes Wine Trail. Our last six years of grape-growing and wine-making has involved unlimited workouts, experiments in every dimension, and an education in the complexity of sustainable agriculture.</p>
<p>Skaneateles Lake and the broader environment will appreciate our vine-nurturing, and ultimately, we think viticulture goes far beyond production efficiency. We hope you'll join the journey with us, and we think you'll enjoy the wine too.</p>
<p>Thanks especially to Betsy for her green thumb and gardening intuition, Bob for his creativity in vineyard equipment development, and Ange for her pruning artistry and energetic support.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Grapevines are especially needy. There's rarely a shortage of fun to be had- weeding, digging, pruning, stomping.. If you're ever in need of an outdoor challenge in the midst of the pandemic, let us know! If you have other ideas, we're all ears.</p>

Acetaldehyde is toxic and should be removed as quickly as possible. To do this, glutathione is used, a peptide that is produced by your own body, but is only available in small quantities as reserve when it is not needed. When drinking alcohol, this reserve quickly runs out. For this reason, Reset added glutathione to give your body more of the required ingredients to quickly process the acetaldehyde.</p><p><strong>Cysteine:</strong><br/>Glutathione can be recycled by your body, but not very fast. To help your body to get rid of the<br/>acetaldehyde faster, your body can make more of the required glutathione. Therefore, amino acids are needed and cysteine is one of the three acids to do so. This amino acid, a nutrient, is not extensively available in your body and could only be obtained via consumption. For example, chicken eggs contain this nutrient, but not in the quantities that are required. Therefore, Reset added cysteine in this food supplement to help your body produce glutathione. By adding cysteine, the acetaldehyde can be processed up to five times faster.</p><p><strong>Vitamin C:</strong><br/>Vitamin C is used by your body to make small modifications in the cysteine amino acid in order to use it in the right form. It is also commonly used by your body as an anti-oxidant to remove other radicles in your body.</p><p><strong>Asparagine:</strong><br/>Asparagine is also an amino acid that your liver requires to process alcohol and other degradation products of alcohol. It stimulates the Krebs cycle, also known as the citric acid cycle.</p><p><strong>Choline:</strong><br/>Choline supports the cleansing effect of the liver.</p><p><strong>Thiamine B1:</strong><br/>Thiamine is an important vitamin that is also used to help breaking down the alcohol in your body and its waste products. It is also important in other cleansing processes in the liver.</p><p><strong>Vitamin B6 and B10:</strong><br/>Both vitamins are also important for the cleansing effect of the liver. Drinking alcohol causes less absorption of these vitamins, which can cause a shortage in your body quickly.</p><p><strong>Melatonin:</strong><br/>Melatonin is the body's sleep hormone which is important for natural sleep. Because your body<br/>cleanses itself during your sleep, it is important that you sleep well. Melatonin is made by your body from serotonin. Drinking alcohol causes a greater consumption of serotonin, which means that less melatonin can be produced.</p><p> </p><p><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/2501209/x/22251261?secret_perk_token=ef1ddd69"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567007957/uobtfdrbmy0if0lshaon.png"" src=""""/></a></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567504554/jrvqlot4pfoaf8gwn5pv.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566829996/ziwltupzuh8ugs1oddhg.png"" src=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://www.sprout.nl/artikel/startups/nooit-meer-een-kater-dankzij-een-wondermiddeltje-deze-startup-verkocht-er-al-50000"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1566981635/z2u2qn47w4wiqgbtujqr.png"" src=""""/></a></h3><h3> </h3><h3> </h3><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567504835/txl0uz6vx2yh7xzdn0zd.png"" src=""""/></h3><p>Reset AfterDrink was founded by renowned Dutch pharmacist, Jan Van Der Lende, as a hangover cure recovery detox drink designed to encourage naturally derived chemicals to develop faster.

<h3>Who are Zak's team?</h3>
<p>We are happy, hungry eaters who want to change things</p>
<p>We want to change the choice we have of snacks to eat - to move from the deep-fried, carb-heavy snacks developed in the 1960s to more healthy, plant-based food.</p>
<p>We want to change how snacks are processed - we want our food to LOOK LIKE what it is, not turned into pastes and reformed into bars and chewy snacks.</p>
<p>We want to change the industry - snack companies are huge, safe and work as corporations do today - questionable social practices like paying suppliers low prices, or operating complicated tax avoidance schemes. We will never do that - we are part of society and want to give, not take.</p>
<p>And we want to change the world - 10% of every contribution goes to our microfinancing fund with Kiva to help kickstart environmental projects around the world. As entrepreneurs, we help other entrepreneurs. You can see our fund <a href=""https://www.kiva.org/lender/zaks"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>HELP US TO BRING THE CHANGE TO LIFE</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564463686/tth6yuxxzkhvnfaxug96.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What is Zak's about?</strong></h3>
<p>We are creating a brand where the products are made using the best ingredients and we work hard to avoid products which are harmful to the <strong>environment</strong>. We focus on plant-based nutrition to provide a combination of non-animal protein and impactful taste - using pulses, beans and nuts. Our products are packaged to fit easily in bags and backpacks and eaten with one hand, for easy on-the-go consumption.</p>
<p>We run our business with <strong>fairness</strong> at the top of our minds. We will never run complex schemes to avoid paying tax. And we run a microfinancing <a href=""https://www.kiva.org/lender/zaks"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">fund</a> to support entrepreneurs starting food businesses in areas of the world where financing is hard to obtain. (More on that fund later in Perks.) </p>

<p>We are creating minimally processed mixes of grains, beans, nuts and seeds that are naturally high in protein. Flavoured to provide memorable and impactful flavors using natural ingredients, and packed in convenient shot-bag packaging, Zak's Snacks are designed to bridge the gaps between meals when you need a boost without relying on high sugar or highly processed alternatives.</p>
<p>So if you want a change from the heavy &amp; pasty protein bars, Zak's will provide the protein, taste and energy you need.</p>

We are happy, hungry eaters who want to change things
We want to change the choice we have of snacks to eat - to move from the deep-fried, carb-heavy snacks developed in the 1960s to more healthy, plant-based food.
We want to change how snacks are processed - we want our food to LOOK LIKE what it is, not turned into pastes and reformed into bars and chewy snacks.
We want to change the industry - snack companies are huge, safe and work as corporations do today - questionable social practices like paying suppliers low prices, or operating complicated tax avoidance schemes. We will never do that - we are part of society and want to give, not take.
And we want to change the world - 10% of every contribution goes to our microfinancing fund with Kiva to help kickstart environmental projects around the world. As entrepreneurs, we help other entrepreneurs. You can see our fund here.
 
HELP US TO BRING THE CHANGE TO LIFE

 
What is Zak's about?
We are creating a brand where the products are made using the best ingredients and we work hard to avoid products which are harmful to the environment. We focus on plant-based nutrition to provide a combination of non-animal protein and impactful taste - using pulses, beans and nuts. Our products are packaged to fit easily in bags and backpacks and eaten with one hand, for easy on-the-go consumption.
We run our business with fairness at the top of our minds. We will never run complex schemes to avoid paying tax. And we run a microfinancing fund to support entrepreneurs starting food businesses in areas of the world where financing is hard to obtain. (More on that fund later in Perks.) 
 
Tell me about Zak's Snacks

We are creating minimally processed mixes of grains, beans, nuts and seeds that are naturally high in protein. Flavoured to provide memorable and impactful flavors using natural ingredients, and packed in convenient shot-bag packaging, Zak's Snacks are designed to bridge the gaps between meals when you need a boost without relying on high sugar or highly processed alternatives.
So if you want a change from the heavy & pasty protein bars, Zak's will provide the protein, taste and energy you need.


 
What We Need & What You Get
In order to take on the giants of the industry, we need some additional funds to get started. We have some funds already ourselves (about 25% of our requirements) but we need more if we are going to make this work.
 
We need backers for Zak's - We need Zackers!
 
We need your support to allow us to


Design and print the packaging

Buy the ingredients and packaging

Pay the people who are making the snacks

Create new jobs for sales teams

We are not going to use your money to

Pay ourselves
Pay influencers or expensive marketing campaigns
Pay large retailers to stock our products

If we truly want to change the way this industry works and produce real food for today's customers, we need to find a way to compete with a tiny fraction of their funds. Which means we need to spend EVERY PENNY WISELY.

 
The goals of this campaign
Involvement and change. It's clear that we need your financial backing to reach our goals but we want Zackers to be excited and follow us as we grow, and to be a creative resource for us as we develop products.
 

We will be offering

Unique numbered ""street-art"" style clothing specifically designed for Zak's (limited availability)
Your name to be added to our packaging design for the first year of production (limited availability)
An opportunity to contribute to our KIVA fund to help microfinance entrepreneurs (10% of every perk)
A discount code for our online store to purchase our products.
A place on the Zak's Creative Council to help choose flavours and snacks
Private social media account to follow us ""behind the scenes"" as we launch.

 


 
The Impact
By contributing to Zak's, you will help to create snacks for the 21st-century consumers, but also join us in building a small business run with the right principles for the world we live in today. You will help David take on the Goliaths and maybe we all win as a result. 
We see business as a social enterprise - your backing will allow us to not only shake up an industry but bring a positive impact to all our stakeholders.

<h3>Hey Backers,</h3>
<p>We're Rachel Eva &amp; Shawn Michael, and we design and make intentional barware.  Our newest project is to make the best 2-OZ measuring cup ever, whether you make cocktails, coffee, or chocolate cake (we make all three!).</p>
<p>We've been on the product development journey for the Napier Jigger for over a year, and in June began manufacturing the final iterations of our design.  Here's a close-up of one of our most popular options: The Industry Jigger.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530293396/fjwreogvihfxlwn71jnd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We funded the first production run in November 2017 with a crowdfunding campaign, and are here on Indiegogo to officially launch pre-sales.  This is the time to pre-order one of these great tools and get your hands on one from the very first production run (before they sell out!)</p>
<p>Here's an UPDATE VIDEO to explain what's new &amp; different (1:55):</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/DdaItLhqlaY?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<h3> </h3>
<p>And here's a quick look at styles and finishes (see ""Options"" section for details):</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530296425/dhi1v64klkzl2sfrmx5r.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why You’ll Fall in Love with the Napier Jigger  </h3>
<p><strong>Accuracy </strong>in cocktail making is essential for a well-balanced drink that tastes like it's supposed to. </p>
<p>But we’ve noticed that most jiggers just aren’t easy to use (especially at a home bar). Many don’t have a good range of measurements, and we often find ourselves needing to use multiple versions and sizes to get that range.</p>
<p>For at-home bartenders without a sink nearby, double sided jiggers are sometimes very impractical. Pour simple syrup into the smaller side, and when you need to use the other side, sticky leftovers drip all over your hand and work surface. The Napier Jigger is one-sided, so you can make all your measurements without making a mess.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530300721/jwahqhrb7gv7z8mo9gdi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The stepped design also means that it's easier to find half-measurements, even when it's dark. Try to estimate an in-between measurement on a v-shaped jigger, and you'll probably miss.  Many jiggers with internal markings are hard to read, and it's challenging to tell when your pour is at (or over) the mark you're aiming for. The Napier Jigger simplifies this by having major increments built into its physical construction.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530292986/zymhnqjvfwuvr0m2uowm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530293083/pe4ph5l0lhrxann1mnhl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our re-designed Napier also includes frequently used 1/4 and 3/4 ounce measurements. They are indicated by internal lines marked between the steps in the bottom two sections. Bravo!  Metric jiggers include additional common measurement markings for in-between the structured steps - see details below.</p>
<p><strong>Quality</strong> jiggers are hard to find. Both home bartenders and professionals have to deal with cheap tools breaking all the time. This is a big challenge for manufacturing a two-sided jigger, which is why we decided to make it one-sided. It won’t break!   </p>
<p><strong>Beautiful </strong>tools are breathtaking, and worth making. This jigger is absolute eye candy, and your guests will definitely take notice. Our Napier reproduction pays homage to an incredible vintage design, and looks absolutely stunning.   </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529436402/fzlha11ll7t3znuw3akk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Space</strong> is another issue we wanted to solve. Rather than having multiple versions on the bar-top, wouldn’t you rather have one go-to measure that does it all? Plus it’s hard to keep track of so many tools, and a real pain when one of your four jiggers is missing - and that’s the one you need.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529436471/fvwbsesaolk5ldz3xmg3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Industry Jigger - No Handle</strong></p>
<p>We're also making a version of the Napier Jigger with no handle. We specifically had bartenders and baristas in mind, because it stacks! This saves even more space on the bar-top, especially when one station requires storage of multiple jiggers for making several drinks at once. </p>
<p>The Industry 2-pack comes in stainless steel, which is durable and affordable for high volume use. We've also got a solid copper industry jigger, which is going to be amazing!</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Product Design</h3>
<p>Napier was a US jewelry company that began producing barware in the 1930’s. The original stepped jigger was silver-plated, and offered 4 measurements: ½ oz, 1 oz, 1 ½ oz, and 2 oz. If you’re lucky enough to find one of the originals, it will cost you $80 - $275, depending on what condition it’s in.  </p>
<p><strong>The Original Napier Jigger (1930’s)</strong> </p>
<p>When we set out to design our ideal jigger, we did a lot of research. We tested and prototyped a few designs, and just weren’t happy with them. One day Rachel came across an Instagram photo of a vintage Napier stepped jigger, and exclaimed - “THIS is exactly what we’ve been searching for!” Then Shawn said “Oh yeah, I’ve seen that jigger before - Jamie Boudreau uses one at Canon in Seattle.” </p>
<p>Sometimes that’s the way brainstorming goes over here.  </p>
<p>We chatted with Jamie about it - he's been using a stepped Napier Jigger for years. He especially likes that since the walls are straight, it's easy to estimate half-measurements (as opposed to V-shaped jiggers), and that it means he now only needs one jigger, not 3. </p>
<p>We were intrigued. It took us months to find and purchase just a few of the vintage pieces to use and test. When we started using them, we fell in love even more. We are so excited to make these available (and affordable) for you to own, use, and fall in love with yourself. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529436661/nwpcnyhxcjlzhbsdph8l.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Design Modifications</strong></p>
<p>We have made a few modifications to the original design. Partly this is to increase functionality, and partly to prevent shady folks from passing our tools off as originals to unsuspecting collectors:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Addition of Standard Spoon <strong>logo</strong> on underside. The original Napier Jigger has “Napier” underneath the handle. Ours will not, but will have our logo on the bottom of the jigger.</li>
<li>
<strong>US (oz) Version</strong>: Addition of ¼ oz and ¾ oz internal measurements. We will be adding two lines on the inside to make it easier for you to measure these very common amounts. The original Napier Jigger does not have these markings. These markings will be on the inside ONLY and are functional additions - they will not be visible on the outside of the jigger.</li>
<li>
<strong>Metric (ml) Version</strong>: This jigger has never before existing with metric measurements. We wanted to stick close to the aesthetics of the original design, but also make a useful metric jigger. Steps correspond to 15ml, 30ml, 45ml, and 60ml.  We've added 4 internal markings for 10ml, 20ml, 40ml, and 50ml.</li>
<li>
<strong>Industry Version:</strong>  This is simply the Napier Jigger with no handle.  Some people find it easier to use without, especially when using them in a professional capacity.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530300777/qbohikdpm32rrvyc2ueh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>And of course one of the biggest modifications we're making is to create different finishes of the Napier Jigger, which originally was only available as a silver plated item.  See your full options below:</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Napier Jigger Options:</h3>
<p>With so many beautiful choices, it might be hard to decide what to get!  Here's a breakdown of the different perks, your options, and some digital renderings to represent the different colors and styles (we don't have photos of each of these, since some of them are being made RIGHT NOW):</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530296642/otwqgky36eoflbnvtxjs.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Which option is best for you?  Here are some considerations:</p>
<p><strong>Handle or No Handle? </strong></p>
<p>You probably know right away if you're a handle or no-handle person. We love the handle because it's beautiful, fun to use, and pays homage to a stunning vintage design. We also love using the industry jiggers with no handle when we need speed, efficiency, and lots of utility. Added bonus of no handle: jiggers stack on the bar when you have more than one.</p>
<p>Special Note: if you know you want a copper jigger, be aware that the Industry Copper Jigger is solid copper, while the Napier Copper Jigger with handle is copper plated. </p>
<p><strong>Which Finish is Best for Me?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Stainless Steel</strong> is dishwasher safe, easy to care for, and super durable. It's a workhorse. Our stainless steel jiggers have a high-polish finish, so they are bright and shiny!  </li>
<li>
<strong>Copper </strong>is beautiful. Copper will develop a patina (e.g. oxidation / tarnish) over time. Some of you want this to happen. If you want to avoid tarnishing, take care of your copper jigger by washing with a mild soap and always drying it off after use. If you're looking for a really durable copper jigger, the Industry version (no handle) is made from solid copper.  We aren't able to make a solid copper jigger with handle, so the handled versions are copper-plated (with REAL copper).</li>
<li>
<strong>Gold Alloy</strong> - It's bright, shiny, flashy, and fun! This is a beautiful jigger that is more affordable and easier to care for than the 24K Gold Jigger. It's plated with a Gold Alloy (imitation gold), so it requires a little more care than stainless steel (don't use abrasive cleaning agents), but it's still dishwasher safe and not nearly as needy as the real deal.</li>
<li>
<strong>Silver</strong> - The original Napier Jigger was a silver-plated measurer, so this is as close to the vintage design as you can get. Silver will naturally develop a patina (oxidation / tarnish), which many of you are eager to see.  If you want to keep it bright and shiny, take care of this jigger by washing with mild soap immediately after use, and drying it right away with a soft cloth. Don't use abrasive cleaning agents. You may need to periodically clean it with silver cleaning solutions to remove oxidation if not in use regularly.</li>
<li>
<strong>24K Gold</strong> - Luxury. This baby is plated in pure gold, so take care of her. She'll have a durable layer of gold, but real gold is softer than the Gold Alloy (and silver and copper), so don't toss her around behind the bar. Clean with mild soap and dry with a soft cloth, don't use harsh or abrasive cleaning things, and you'll hand her down to your grandkids in good shape one day.</li>
</ul>
<p>Special Note: We make sure ALL our plated tools receive a durable coating of plating so they will last a long time with proper care.  Most ""colored"" barware is flash-plated, which means the thinnest amount of plating material is applied just to achieve the desired color, and it will rub off easily. While any plated object is susceptible to wear over time, ours will last longer than the other stuff. </p>
<p><strong>OZ or ML?</strong></p>
<p>Usually this one is pretty easy: if you live in the US, Myanmar, or Burma, you probably use OZ measurements. Everyone else uses the Metric System. </p>
<p>However, if you're a real cocktail nerd you may be trying recipes from all over the place. So you'll either need to memorize common conversions, or just get one of each (the Industry 2-Pack is a great way to do that).</p>
<p>Here are the measurements covered by each jigger (<strong>bold</strong> is for stepped measurements, <i>italics</i> are for measurements marked by internal lines):</p>
<p>Ounces (OZ): <i>0.25 oz</i>, <strong>0.5 oz</strong>, <i>0.75 OZ</i>, <strong>1 oz</strong>, <strong>1.5 oz</strong>, <strong>2 oz</strong>, 2.25 oz if filled to the top</p>
<p>Milliliters(ML): <i>10ml</i>, <strong>15ml</strong>, <i>20ml</i>, <strong>30ml</strong>, <i>40ml</i>, <strong>45ml</strong>, <i>50ml</i>, <strong>60ml</strong>, ~65ml if filled to the top</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530301543/kxfbguk4yzppko9kugn9.jpg"" src=""""/>. </p>
<p><strong>For the Nerds:</strong></p>
<p>The structure of the body of the jigger is the same for both the metric (ML) and imperial (OZ) jiggers. The ml and oz measurements that we have built into the body are so close to one another on a conversion basis, it didn't make sense to make two completely different body designs.  When we were doing our measurements (see below), human error alone is many factors larger than the discrepancy between oz and ml conversions.</p>
<p>However, we did build what we think is a neat little guide into the structure of the jigger.   Fill to the bottom of each step if measuring for ounces, without letting the meniscus of the liquid spill over the step. If measuring for milliliters, fill just until the liquid begins to buckle with surface tension and break into the section above.  That's about equal to the conversion discrepancy between oz and ml in this jigger.  Read all the details and see our extensive testing in our Kickstarter <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/workofmyhands/the-napier-jigger-a-vintage-cocktail-measuring-cup/posts/2196116"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Update #13 - First Production Samples</a></p>
<h3>Product Development &amp; Manufacturing</h3>
<p>We launched our initial crowdfunding campaign using the vintage jiggers as our design prototypes.  The jiggers represented in our main project video (above) are all design prototypes, using vintage jiggers like this one (below) to represent the concept we intended to create.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530300632/wcnm6399xkjuqmjnk9s6.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>After our initial crowdfunding campaign (Nov 2017),  we began the process of re-creating and modifying that design.  We created 3-D files, 3-D prints, and lots of product specification documents, and sent them to the factory. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529446214/ibkuxja1wqlwtozuwmtb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are making these in southern China with a contract manufacturer that we've been working with since 2014. They started working on tooling in December, finished the molds in March, and then sent us our first photo of the jigger-in-progress (below, left).  We immediately recognized that they'd transposed two of the measurements and the top lip of the jigger was almost martini-glass-large!  That's how manufacturing projects go, sometimes. </p>
<p>We alerted them to this error, and they quickly sent back a corrected version of our Napier jigger, in-the-raw (below, right).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529446509/bzypveajeqv2h7geqed9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>After correcting that initial issue, we received our first production samples in April, complete with measurement markings and handles, and all polished up and pretty. We spent time testing, measuring, and analyzing these first samples, and sent our feedback to the factory so they could incorporate it.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529447597/rejlw6uy1qt1kks3yu1q.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The biggest changes we had made to these first production samples were to correct the font (our desired font was not originally used), and to create a sharper angle on the lip of the jigger, so that 2oz/60ml measurement could be a little more discernible.</p>
<p>The jigger on the left is a production sample #1, with old font and weak upper lip (no pun intended).  The jigger on the right is a production sample #2, with corrected font and sharper top angle.  We MUCH prefer this font - it's got the character this jigger deserves. (Note that production sample on the right (#2) is before being polished - all jiggers will be polished, not brushed)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530312221/ezspqn3clt1r6gpo7qji.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We ran into some more challenges and made some adjustments.  The factory incorporated our feedback, and we received the revised designs in June. We are proud to have final, vetted, approved designs that have been turned into beautiful production samples.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1529436991/z8huskktqo6lsjfiuclz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>We approved these revised production samples in June, and mass production for the Napier Jigger is currently underway!  </p>
<h3>Why We're On Indiegogo</h3>
<p>We've got about 2 months left in our production window, and you have been banging on our doors all over the internet to get your hands on Napier Jiggers - so here's your chance.  If you missed the initial Kickstarter Campaign, pre-order one here. </p>
<p>This Indiegogo InDemand project lists all of your options in their final form, now that we've made changes, vetted designs, and added the Metric Napier Jigger for all you international backers.</p>
<p>By pre-ordering this baby, you'll help us manufacture a second round of jiggers to have inventory for the holidays. AND we'll be able to get started with the development of our next tool (woo hoo!). </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Ok, we say this with all of our campaigns (we've done 4): all manufacturing projects face challenges during the product development lifecycle.  If making things were easy, everyone would do it.</p>
<p>The Napier Jigger was our MOST challenging product development project so far. The good news is that we've been through most of the hard stuff, and we came out on the other side with some incredible products.  But the project isn't over, and there is still the possibility that challenges will rear up during the production process, during quality control inspections, and with packaging and shipping logistics. </p>
<p>If we do run into challenges or delays, we'll work to solve those problems. We have very high standards, and any changes are always evaluated in depth, and communicated thoroughly to backers.  Maintaining the quality and integrity of our products is always a main priority.  Maintaining excellent and clear communication with backers is always non-negotiable.  Check out our most recent <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/workofmyhands/the-napier-jigger-a-vintage-cocktail-measuring-cup/updates"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kickstarter Updates</a> and <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/workofmyhands/the-napier-jigger-a-vintage-cocktail-measuring-cup/comments"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Comments</a> for how we demonstrated this IRL during our last campaign.</p>
<p>We also pair all challenging news with photos of beautiful cocktails, because it's helpful to remember why we're all doing this together!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>So maybe you backed during the Kickstarter, or you're just fans (we love you!).  You don't really want another jigger (even though they'll make incredible gifts).  Or maybe you really want one, but you're broke.  Here are other ways you can get involved:</p>

<p>Rachel Eva &amp; Shawn Michael</p>
</div></div>","Hey Backers,
We're Rachel Eva & Shawn Michael, and we design and make intentional barware.  Our newest project is to make the best 2-OZ measuring cup ever, whether you make cocktails, coffee, or chocolate cake (we make all three!).
We've been on the product development journey for the Napier Jigger for over a year, and in June began manufacturing the final iterations of our design.  Here's a close-up of one of our most popular options: The Industry Jigger.

We funded the first production run in November 2017 with a crowdfunding campaign, and are here on Indiegogo to officially launch pre-sales.  This is the time to pre-order one of these great tools and get your hands on one from the very first production run (before they sell out!)
Here's an UPDATE VIDEO to explain what's new & different (1:55):

 
And here's a quick look at styles and finishes (see ""Options"" section for details):
 

 
Why You’ll Fall in Love with the Napier Jigger  
Accuracy in cocktail making is essential for a well-balanced drink that tastes like it's supposed to. 
But we’ve noticed that most jiggers just aren’t easy to use (especially at a home bar). Many don’t have a good range of measurements, and we often find ourselves needing to use multiple versions and sizes to get that range.
For at-home bartenders without a sink nearby, double sided jiggers are sometimes very impractical. Pour simple syrup into the smaller side, and when you need to use the other side, sticky leftovers drip all over your hand and work surface. The Napier Jigger is one-sided, so you can make all your measurements without making a mess.  

The stepped design also means that it's easier to find half-measurements, even when it's dark. Try to estimate an in-between measurement on a v-shaped jigger, and you'll probably miss.  Many jiggers with internal markings are hard to read, and it's challenging to tell when your pour is at (or over) the mark you're aiming for. The Napier Jigger simplifies this by having major increments built into its physical construction.  

 

Our re-designed Napier also includes frequently used 1/4 and 3/4 ounce measurements. They are indicated by internal lines marked between the steps in the bottom two sections. Bravo!  Metric jiggers include additional common measurement markings for in-between the structured steps - see details below.
Quality jiggers are hard to find. Both home bartenders and professionals have to deal with cheap tools breaking all the time. This is a big challenge for manufacturing a two-sided jigger, which is why we decided to make it one-sided. It won’t break!   
Beautiful tools are breathtaking, and worth making. This jigger is absolute eye candy, and your guests will definitely take notice. Our Napier reproduction pays homage to an incredible vintage design, and looks absolutely stunning.   

Space is another issue we wanted to solve. Rather than having multiple versions on the bar-top, wouldn’t you rather have one go-to measure that does it all? Plus it’s hard to keep track of so many tools, and a real pain when one of your four jiggers is missing - and that’s the one you need.  

 
Industry Jigger - No Handle
We're also making a version of the Napier Jigger with no handle. We specifically had bartenders and baristas in mind, because it stacks! This saves even more space on the bar-top, especially when one station requires storage of multiple jiggers for making several drinks at once. 
The Industry 2-pack comes in stainless steel, which is durable and affordable for high volume use. We've also got a solid copper industry jigger, which is going to be amazing!

 
Product Design
Napier was a US jewelry company that began producing barware in the 1930’s. The original stepped jigger was silver-plated, and offered 4 measurements: ½ oz, 1 oz, 1 ½ oz, and 2 oz. If you’re lucky enough to find one of the originals, it will cost you $80 - $275, depending on what condition it’s in.  
The Original Napier Jigger (1930’s) 
When we set out to design our ideal jigger, we did a lot of research. We tested and prototyped a few designs, and just weren’t happy with them. One day Rachel came across an Instagram photo of a vintage Napier stepped jigger, and exclaimed - “THIS is exactly what we’ve been searching for!” Then Shawn said “Oh yeah, I’ve seen that jigger before - Jamie Boudreau uses one at Canon in Seattle.” 
Sometimes that’s the way brainstorming goes over here.  
We chatted with Jamie about it - he's been using a stepped Napier Jigger for years. He especially likes that since the walls are straight, it's easy to estimate half-measurements (as opposed to V-shaped jiggers), and that it means he now only needs one jigger, not 3. 
We were intrigued. It took us months to find and purchase just a few of the vintage pieces to use and test. When we started using them, we fell in love even more. We are so excited to make these available (and affordable) for you to own, use, and fall in love with yourself. 

Design Modifications
We have made a few modifications to the original design. Partly this is to increase functionality, and partly to prevent shady folks from passing our tools off as originals to unsuspecting collectors:  

Addition of Standard Spoon logo on underside. The original Napier Jigger has “Napier” underneath the handle. Ours will not, but will have our logo on the bottom of the jigger.

US (oz) Version: Addition of ¼ oz and ¾ oz internal measurements. We will be adding two lines on the inside to make it easier for you to measure these very common amounts. The original Napier Jigger does not have these markings. These markings will be on the inside ONLY and are functional additions - they will not be visible on the outside of the jigger.

Metric (ml) Version: This jigger has never before existing with metric measurements. We wanted to stick close to the aesthetics of the original design, but also make a useful metric jigger. Steps correspond to 15ml, 30ml, 45ml, and 60ml.  We've added 4 internal markings for 10ml, 20ml, 40ml, and 50ml.

Industry Version:  This is simply the Napier Jigger with no handle.  Some people find it easier to use without, especially when using them in a professional capacity.



 
And of course one of the biggest modifications we're making is to create different finishes of the Napier Jigger, which originally was only available as a silver plated item.  See your full options below:
 
Napier Jigger Options:
With so many beautiful choices, it might be hard to decide what to get!  Here's a breakdown of the different perks, your options, and some digital renderings to represent the different colors and styles (we don't have photos of each of these, since some of them are being made RIGHT NOW):

Which option is best for you?  Here are some considerations:
Handle or No Handle? 
You probably know right away if you're a handle or no-handle person. We love the handle because it's beautiful, fun to use, and pays homage to a stunning vintage design. We also love using the industry jiggers with no handle when we need speed, efficiency, and lots of utility. Added bonus of no handle: jiggers stack on the bar when you have more than one.
Special Note: if you know you want a copper jigger, be aware that the Industry Copper Jigger is solid copper, while the Napier Copper Jigger with handle is copper plated. 
Which Finish is Best for Me?


Stainless Steel is dishwasher safe, easy to care for, and super durable. It's a workhorse. Our stainless steel jiggers have a high-polish finish, so they are bright and shiny!  

Copper is beautiful. Copper will develop a patina (e.g. oxidation / tarnish) over time. Some of you want this to happen. If you want to avoid tarnishing, take care of your copper jigger by washing with a mild soap and always drying it off after use. If you're looking for a really durable copper jigger, the Industry version (no handle) is made from solid copper.  We aren't able to make a solid copper jigger with handle, so the handled versions are copper-plated (with REAL copper).

Gold Alloy - It's bright, shiny, flashy, and fun! This is a beautiful jigger that is more affordable and easier to care for than the 24K Gold Jigger. It's plated with a Gold Alloy (imitation gold), so it requires a little more care than stainless steel (don't use abrasive cleaning agents), but it's still dishwasher safe and not nearly as needy as the real deal.

Silver - The original Napier Jigger was a silver-plated measurer, so this is as close to the vintage design as you can get. Silver will naturally develop a patina (oxidation / tarnish), which many of you are eager to see.  If you want to keep it bright and shiny, take care of this jigger by washing with mild soap immediately after use, and drying it right away with a soft cloth. Don't use abrasive cleaning agents. You may need to periodically clean it with silver cleaning solutions to remove oxidation if not in use regularly.

24K Gold - Luxury. This baby is plated in pure gold, so take care of her. She'll have a durable layer of gold, but real gold is softer than the Gold Alloy (and silver and copper), so don't toss her around behind the bar. Clean with mild soap and dry with a soft cloth, don't use harsh or abrasive cleaning things, and you'll hand her down to your grandkids in good shape one day.

Special Note: We make sure ALL our plated tools receive a durable coating of plating so they will last a long time with proper care.  Most ""colored"" barware is flash-plated, which means the thinnest amount of plating material is applied just to achieve the desired color, and it will rub off easily. While any plated object is susceptible to wear over time, ours will last longer than the other stuff. 
OZ or ML?
Usually this one is pretty easy: if you live in the US, Myanmar, or Burma, you probably use OZ measurements. Everyone else uses the Metric System. 
However, if you're a real cocktail nerd you may be trying recipes from all over the place. So you'll either need to memorize common conversions, or just get one of each (the Industry 2-Pack is a great way to do that).
Here are the measurements covered by each jigger (bold is for stepped measurements, italics are for measurements marked by internal lines):
Ounces (OZ): 0.25 oz, 0.5 oz, 0.75 OZ, 1 oz, 1.5 oz, 2 oz, 2.25 oz if filled to the top
Milliliters(ML): 10ml, 15ml, 20ml, 30ml, 40ml, 45ml, 50ml, 60ml, ~65ml if filled to the top
. 
For the Nerds:
The structure of the body of the jigger is the same for both the metric (ML) and imperial (OZ) jiggers. The ml and oz measurements that we have built into the body are so close to one another on a conversion basis, it didn't make sense to make two completely different body designs.  When we were doing our measurements (see below), human error alone is many factors larger than the discrepancy between oz and ml conversions.
However, we did build what we think is a neat little guide into the structure of the jigger.   Fill to the bottom of each step if measuring for ounces, without letting the meniscus of the liquid spill over the step. If measuring for milliliters, fill just until the liquid begins to buckle with surface tension and break into the section above.  That's about equal to the conversion discrepancy between oz and ml in this jigger.  Read all the details and see our extensive testing in our Kickstarter Update #13 - First Production Samples
Product Development & Manufacturing
We launched our initial crowdfunding campaign using the vintage jiggers as our design prototypes.  The jiggers represented in our main project video (above) are all design prototypes, using vintage jiggers like this one (below) to represent the concept we intended to create.

After our initial crowdfunding campaign (Nov 2017),  we began the process of re-creating and modifying that design.  We created 3-D files, 3-D prints, and lots of product specification documents, and sent them to the factory. 

We are making these in southern China with a contract manufacturer that we've been working with since 2014. They started working on tooling in December, finished the molds in March, and then sent us our first photo of the jigger-in-progress (below, left).  We immediately recognized that they'd transposed two of the measurements and the top lip of the jigger was almost martini-glass-large!  That's how manufacturing projects go, sometimes. 
We alerted them to this error, and they quickly sent back a corrected version of our Napier jigger, in-the-raw (below, right).

After correcting that initial issue, we received our first production samples in April, complete with measurement markings and handles, and all polished up and pretty. We spent time testing, measuring, and analyzing these first samples, and sent our feedback to the factory so they could incorporate it.

The biggest changes we had made to these first production samples were to correct the font (our desired font was not originally used), and to create a sharper angle on the lip of the jigger, so that 2oz/60ml measurement could be a little more discernible.
The jigger on the left is a production sample #1, with old font and weak upper lip (no pun intended).  The jigger on the right is a production sample #2, with corrected font and sharper top angle.  We MUCH prefer this font - it's got the character this jigger deserves. (Note that production sample on the right (#2) is before being polished - all jiggers will be polished, not brushed)

We ran into some more challenges and made some adjustments.  The factory incorporated our feedback, and we received the revised designs in June. We are proud to have final, vetted, approved designs that have been turned into beautiful production samples.

If you want to read up on our product development journey, you can find past updates on our Kickstarter project.  We'll be posting any new updates going forward here on Indiegogo as well.
We approved these revised production samples in June, and mass production for the Napier Jigger is currently underway!  
Why We're On Indiegogo
We've got about 2 months left in our production window, and you have been banging on our doors all over the internet to get your hands on Napier Jiggers - so here's your chance.  If you missed the initial Kickstarter Campaign, pre-order one here. 
This Indiegogo InDemand project lists all of your options in their final form, now that we've made changes, vetted designs, and added the Metric Napier Jigger for all you international backers.
By pre-ordering this baby, you'll help us manufacture a second round of jiggers to have inventory for the holidays. AND we'll be able to get started with the development of our next tool (woo hoo!). 

Risks & Challenges
Ok, we say this with all of our campaigns (we've done 4): all manufacturing projects face challenges during the product development lifecycle.  If making things were easy, everyone would do it.
The Napier Jigger was our MOST challenging product development project so far. The good news is that we've been through most of the hard stuff, and we came out on the other side with some incredible products.  But the project isn't over, and there is still the possibility that challenges will rear up during the production process, during quality control inspections, and with packaging and shipping logistics. 
If we do run into challenges or delays, we'll work to solve those problems. We have very high standards, and any changes are always evaluated in depth, and communicated thoroughly to backers.  Maintaining the quality and integrity of our products is always a main priority.  Maintaining excellent and clear communication with backers is always non-negotiable.  Check out our most recent Kickstarter Updates and Comments for how we demonstrated this IRL during our last campaign.
We also pair all challenging news with photos of beautiful cocktails, because it's helpful to remember why we're all doing this together!


Other Ways You Can Help

<h3>When we spend $3 on a latte, Maria only earns 3 cents</h3>

<h3>Let's buy Maria's coffee at financially sustainable prices</h3>
<p>Maria typically sells her coffee for less than $1.50/lb to middlemen. This is not financially sustainable. We're going to pay a financially sustainable price of $4.50/lb, over 3x Fairtrade prices. </p>
<p>This means she can continue giving her community the 10,000 avocados she also grows on her farm and continue employing Santos, her one full time worker. </p>

</div></div>","New stretch goal! Let's get to $5,000 to offer Maria 5x Fairtrade prices.
 
Maria's coffee has notes of juicy tropical fruits, caramel and a creamy body. 
Maria is a widow in her 60s living in a tiny town in northern El Salvador. 
This year her coffee was a National Winner in El Salvador's Cup of Excellence competition. (It's like the Oscars of coffee.)
 

 
When we spend $3 on a latte, Maria only earns 3 cents
Maria struggles to earn enough money to cover her costs because coffee prices are so low. 
And because her farm is small coffee middlemen don't waste their time helping her achieve higher prices. 
Learn more here: 

 
Let's buy Maria's coffee at financially sustainable prices
Maria typically sells her coffee for less than $1.50/lb to middlemen. This is not financially sustainable. We're going to pay a financially sustainable price of $4.50/lb, over 3x Fairtrade prices. 
This means she can continue giving her community the 10,000 avocados she also grows on her farm and continue employing Santos, her one full time worker. 
 

 

 
Choose how much coffee you want!
The bags are 250g each and will be roasted by one of Norway's best roasters and packaged in these beautiful boxes.
Postage is €5 flat around the world and you'll get your coffee in time for Christmas.
Consider getting an extra bag or two as Christmas presents. Each bag is flushed with nitrogen to preserve the roasted coffee all the way into January.

We need to raise €1,000 
We'll buy a big bag of Maria's green, unroasted coffee and ship it from El Salvador to Oslo. In Oslo, my friend Talor Browne will roast the coffee, package it up and ship it to you!
Talor (picture above) has roasted for some of the most famous specialty coffee roasters and now runs her own roastery, Talor Made.
 
Filter Stories is an investigative documentary podcast that's actually not about coffee itself
Nicknamed the 'This American Life of coffee', each thirty minute episode takes 100 hours to make.
Fan favourites include the story of a stateless barista stuck on a faraway island:

 
A woman who loves her barista job, but she doesn't know about her bosses' secret podcast  revealing the women they're having sex with in her community:

 
And a coffee producer who is almost murdered three times during a civil war:

I invented a way to let them have fresh vegetables anytime they came through the kitchen:</p>
<p><b>1.</b> <b>VeggiDome is easy.</b> Kids (or anyone) can reach in and grab snacks and put the lid back on. It functions as a cookie jar for veggies. </p>
<p><b>2. </b> <b>VeggiDome is big.</b> By adding vegetables in through the top, you can fit a ton of veggies inside VeggiDome. With a variety of vegetables on display, it's hard to resist grabbing something as you walk (or run) past.</p>
<p><b>3.</b>  <b>VeggiDome keeps veggies alive.</b> The veggies' moisture remains in the dome, keeping the vegetables crisp, lush, delicious and irresistible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Engineering The Perfect Shape:</b></p>
<p>Why this shape and size?</p>
<p><b>1.</b> At 12 x 10 x 6 inches, VeggiDome is the perfect size to hold several days worth of veggies. You can keep more vegetables out in the open and waste less. </p>
<p><b>2.</b> The base plate is oval-shaped so that it takes up less surface space. Plus, we maximized the volume with a tall, 6-inch height.</p>
<p><b>3.</b>  The oval hole on top is long. This shape makes it super-easy to place whole carrots, celery, and more, into the dome.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Safe &amp; Environmentally-Friendly</b></p>

<p>My family is serious about health issues, especially in the kitchen. The VeggiDome is made of the same borosilicate glass used in Pyrex. No lead, no plastic, no BPA. And the design is smooth without lines or crevices, which makes cleaning easy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Over A Decade In The Making</b></p>
<p>The VeggiDome has completed a 12-year process to get to this point. The design and materials for the prototype have been perfected, tested and approved. All that's left is to manufacture and deliver VeggiDomes to families everywhere. Together we can Keep Veggies Alive.</p>

<div><b>How VeggiDome Works</b></div> <p> </p>
<p>VeggieDome's three-dish combination protects the vegetables from losing moisture while emitting water vapor. It traps and maintains water in the air inside the dome, allowing veggies to “drink” the moisture. Ethylene gas which is produced by vegetables that have been harvested, escapes through the lid, leaving the veggies in a rare, life-supporting place. The result: vegetables stay hydrated and vital, without wilting or going bad. </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b><i>You waste 30% of the vegetables you buy. Here’s how to stop the madness. </i></b></p>
<p>Admit it. You have veggies spoiling somewhere your refrigerator right now. On average, 30% of the vegetables we buy become spoiled, forgotten and are thrown out, ($100/month in most households). Nobody likes to see food go to waste. But the fact is, wrapping vegetables in plastic and putting them in the fridge just DOESN'T WORK. </p>
<p>Here's what does: VeggiDome. Groundbreaking patented technology can keep 100% of your veggies in the Dome from going to waste. It's a simple addition to your household. But it creates a huge, positive change in your life. </p>

<div><b>Inventing at Lunch</b></div>I’m always interested in ways to help my two children stay healthy.  One day, 11 years ago, I was getting lunch ready in the kitchen and I thought I’d wash a whole pile of fresh vegetables to put on the table for the kids. “What the heck,” I boldly piled a large assortment of veggies onto a large plate. The kids smiled at this sight, ate one or two  pieces and scattered off. I was left with a whole plate of freshly washed vegetables.<p><u>Then I did something that changed the entire kitchen for years</u>. Instead of scooping the fresh vegetables into a plastic bag (which would spoil later in the fridge,) I covered the pile with a clear glass. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Something amazing happened. The kids came back and grabbed more veggies throughout the afternoon. We added new vegetables all week long. The more we added, the more the kids ate. We kept that glass lid on the table for years.</p>
<p>The bowl served a great purpose, but it had problems. Veggies spilled out when the cover was raised.  The cover was difficult to replace without carrots or beans sticking out, breaking the seal. Many years later, VeggiDome has finally been engineered to perfection. Now, it can hold more veggies, they are easy to grab, closing the cover is as simple as a lid, and the ethylene gas can escape. Your veggies will last a whole lot longer than three hours. More like 5-7 days! </p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""> </p>
<p><b>When you buy a VeggiDome, you're not merely purchasing a functional addition to your household. You're leading a movement. One that will lead to you and your family having healthier, happier lives. </b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>And when you buy more than one VeggiDome, you're giving the gift of health and wellbeing to friends and neighbors. You'll be joining us on our quest to Keep Veggies Alive.</b></p>

</div></div>","Keeping Veggies Alive!Something amazing happens when you keep your veggies out in the open instead of buried in your fridge. They get eaten! With VeggiDome™, your vegetables will stay fresh, hydrated and delicious – vital and alive – for up to six days. That means no more wilted, wasted vegetables buried in your refrigerator. And it means your family will eat a lot more vegetables. In this way, VeggiDome is keeping veggies alive, in more ways than one.

The Story of Our Design:
 
 As a father, I always want my kids to eat more fresh vegetables for their health. I invented a way to let them have fresh vegetables anytime they came through the kitchen:
1. VeggiDome is easy. Kids (or anyone) can reach in and grab snacks and put the lid back on. It functions as a cookie jar for veggies. 
2.  VeggiDome is big. By adding vegetables in through the top, you can fit a ton of veggies inside VeggiDome. With a variety of vegetables on display, it's hard to resist grabbing something as you walk (or run) past.
3.  VeggiDome keeps veggies alive. The veggies' moisture remains in the dome, keeping the vegetables crisp, lush, delicious and irresistible.
 
 
Engineering The Perfect Shape:
Why this shape and size?
1. At 12 x 10 x 6 inches, VeggiDome is the perfect size to hold several days worth of veggies. You can keep more vegetables out in the open and waste less. 
2. The base plate is oval-shaped so that it takes up less surface space. Plus, we maximized the volume with a tall, 6-inch height.
3.  The oval hole on top is long. This shape makes it super-easy to place whole carrots, celery, and more, into the dome.
 
 
Safe & Environmentally-Friendly

My family is serious about health issues, especially in the kitchen. The VeggiDome is made of the same borosilicate glass used in Pyrex. No lead, no plastic, no BPA. And the design is smooth without lines or crevices, which makes cleaning easy.
 
 
Over A Decade In The Making
The VeggiDome has completed a 12-year process to get to this point. The design and materials for the prototype have been perfected, tested and approved. All that's left is to manufacture and deliver VeggiDomes to families everywhere. Together we can Keep Veggies Alive.
 
The VeggiDome will keep your vegetables:
     • Fresh - without refrigeration for 4 to 6 days.
     • Visible - on your table or counter top.
     • Accessible - Ready to Eat. Delicious.
 
 
VeggiDome can improve your quality of life by helping you:
     • Eat Healthier
     • Lose Weight
     • Save Money
     • Reduce Food Waste
 
 
                       
 
How VeggiDome Works  
VeggieDome's three-dish combination protects the vegetables from losing moisture while emitting water vapor. It traps and maintains water in the air inside the dome, allowing veggies to “drink” the moisture. Ethylene gas which is produced by vegetables that have been harvested, escapes through the lid, leaving the veggies in a rare, life-supporting place. The result: vegetables stay hydrated and vital, without wilting or going bad. 
You waste 30% of the vegetables you buy. Here’s how to stop the madness. 
Admit it. You have veggies spoiling somewhere your refrigerator right now. On average, 30% of the vegetables we buy become spoiled, forgotten and are thrown out, ($100/month in most households). Nobody likes to see food go to waste. But the fact is, wrapping vegetables in plastic and putting them in the fridge just DOESN'T WORK. 
Here's what does: VeggiDome. Groundbreaking patented technology can keep 100% of your veggies in the Dome from going to waste. It's a simple addition to your household. But it creates a huge, positive change in your life.

The Inventor: The Guy Who Brings Snap Peas To A Bowling Alley
What food would you bring to a bowling alley with a dozen 8-year-olds? Pizza? Hotdogs? I'm the dad who would haul in five pounds of washed, trimmed veggies. Yep, I'm that guy. To the embarrassment/pride of my kids. 
Say what you will. But that platter of fresh vegetables got eaten up faster than any bag of chips. That’s the surprising thing about veggies. Kids WILL eat them. The key is you have to have the vegetables out.

But it does a really good job at that one thing.</p><p><b>Why is nugget ice so important?</b></p><p>Ice doesn’t just keep drinks cold. Millions of Americans crave nugget ice for its chewability and its flavor retention properties.</p><p><b>How does it work?</b></p><p>Opal nugget ice is made by scraping the ice flakes off the inside of a chilled aluminum cylinder. The flakes are extruded through a round hole, compacting them into frozen nuggets of air and ice. Nugget ice is about 50% air by volume, and those tiny pinholes of air between the ice flakes are the secret to soft, chewable, flavorful ice.</p><p><b>How do I fill the Opal Nugget Ice Maker?</b></p><p>Simply add water to the filling reservoir under the bucket. 6 cups of water is enough to make 3 pounds of ice. The reservoir has a max fill line that indicates the amount of water to be added to the icemaker.</p><p><b>What happens if I unplug Opal while the bucket is full of ice?</b></p><p>We’ve thought of everything! Opal includes a reservoir large enough to contain the meltwater from the ice bucket, just in case you don’t finish your ice before it’s time to power down.</p><p><b>How smart is Opal?</b></p><p>Opal is smart enough to know when to start and stop making ice. It’s equipped with a sensor that will identify the fill level of the bucket to turn the ice maker on and off. Just like in any cooler, ice will slowly melt within the air-insulated bucket. Opal will automatically turn on to make sure that the bucket is refilling with ice.</p><p><b>What happens to the ice as it melts?</b></p><p>Opal recycles the melted ice water to ensure that your ice bucket is always full of fresh, cold nugget ice.</p><p><b>How fast does Opal work?</b></p><p>Your first nuggets of ice will be delivered in about 15 minutes. At a rate of 1 pound per hour, Opal outpaces all the residential refrigerator ice makers that we have tested. You should have a full 3 pound bucket in just over 3 hours, and every time you remove ice, more will be made.</p><p><b>Do you have more detailed feature information?</b></p><p>•  Stainless steel</p><p>•  Dimensions: 17.25"" T x 10.5"" W x 15.5"" D</p><p>•  Capacitive touch user interface</p><p>•  Fits underneath most cabinets above the countertop</p><p>•  Opal can be plugged into any standard 120V outlet</p><p>•  Makes 1 pound of nugget ice per hour</p><p>•  Clear ice bin holds 3 pounds of ice</p><p><b>Where can Opal be shipped?</b></p><p>We will ship only to the US and Canada for this Indiegogo campaign.

</div></div>","Our Indiegogo campaign has ended but you can still pre-order Opal at: nuggetice.com






FirstBuild is a co-creation community that is changing the way products come to market by letting a community influence the product from the very beginning. Backed by GE Appliances, we have access to world-class engineering and design talent. Opal first showed up as an idea posted by a community member on our FirstBuild.com web forum. It was a simple idea, so why didn’t a residential nugget ice maker exist? We listened to our community, and now we are launching the product to the Indiegogo community, a group of early adopters who see into the future of technology.Why are we doing an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign? Because we know that the best way to find out if people really want a product is to give them the opportunity to buy it. Crowdfunding on Indiegogo gives us the opportunity to validate that the product matches the needs of the market before we make hundreds of thousands of them.Make sense? If you have any questions, visit us at nuggetice.com or email us at social@firstbuild.com.What makes Opal different?Opal is an icemaker designed for the enthusiasts: people who drop by their favorite restaurant on the weekend to pick up a bag of that special soft ice or have googled “nugget ice maker for home” only to find that home nugget ice makers start at $2000 - $3000.What does it do?Opal only does one thing: make chewable, craveable nugget ice. But it does a really good job at that one thing.Why is nugget ice so important?Ice doesn’t just keep drinks cold. Millions of Americans crave nugget ice for its chewability and its flavor retention properties.How does it work?Opal nugget ice is made by scraping the ice flakes off the inside of a chilled aluminum cylinder. The flakes are extruded through a round hole, compacting them into frozen nuggets of air and ice. Nugget ice is about 50% air by volume, and those tiny pinholes of air between the ice flakes are the secret to soft, chewable, flavorful ice.How do I fill the Opal Nugget Ice Maker?Simply add water to the filling reservoir under the bucket. 6 cups of water is enough to make 3 pounds of ice. The reservoir has a max fill line that indicates the amount of water to be added to the icemaker.What happens if I unplug Opal while the bucket is full of ice?We’ve thought of everything! Opal includes a reservoir large enough to contain the meltwater from the ice bucket, just in case you don’t finish your ice before it’s time to power down.How smart is Opal?Opal is smart enough to know when to start and stop making ice. It’s equipped with a sensor that will identify the fill level of the bucket to turn the ice maker on and off. Just like in any cooler, ice will slowly melt within the air-insulated bucket. Opal will automatically turn on to make sure that the bucket is refilling with ice.What happens to the ice as it melts?Opal recycles the melted ice water to ensure that your ice bucket is always full of fresh, cold nugget ice.How fast does Opal work?Your first nuggets of ice will be delivered in about 15 minutes. At a rate of 1 pound per hour, Opal outpaces all the residential refrigerator ice makers that we have tested. You should have a full 3 pound bucket in just over 3 hours, and every time you remove ice, more will be made.Do you have more detailed feature information?•  Stainless steel•  Dimensions: 17.25"" T x 10.5"" W x 15.5"" D•  Capacitive touch user interface•  Fits underneath most cabinets above the countertop•  Opal can be plugged into any standard 120V outlet•  Makes 1 pound of nugget ice per hour•  Clear ice bin holds 3 pounds of iceWhere can Opal be shipped?We will ship only to the US and Canada for this Indiegogo campaign. In the future, we hope Opal will be available worldwide.When will you be shipping Opal?Production of Opal units began on June 27, 2016. We expect the first units to start arriving at backers' homes near the end of July 2016. Orders will be fulfilled in roughly the sequence that they were purchased on Indiegogo.What is the warranty for Opal?Opal will include a one-year limited warranty.Taylor has been developing and marketing products for 11 years.

For as long as I can remember, I've loved baking from scratch. Baking always brings family and friends together - especially at the holidays and special occasions. Baking is also great therapy. And among the simplest-to-make, most decadent baked goods are brownies.
Over time, I've developed countless recipes for these soul satisfying treats: with nuts and without, chewy and fudgy or moist and cakey, with raspberry liqueur or salted caramel or other flavors that are sure to delight. Now, those favorites which have earned the most brownie points will be collected inBaked Chicago: The Simply Decadent Brownies Cookbook.

<p><strong>Spaghetti - Cavalier Cocco </strong></p>
<p>Today, we offer you one of the <u>finest interpretations</u> of Italian Spaghetti by the <strong>Pastificio Cavalier Cocco</strong>. Founded by Domenico Cocco in 1916, a small producer situated in Fara San Martino, Chieti. Cocco follows the strict rules imposed by the “Pasta Masters”, which argued that to make a good pasta <u>3 ingredients</u> were needed: grain coming from the mountains, spring water and pure fresh air for the drying process. All characteristics native to this region, resulting in truly special pasta.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510647585/vykyk3xh7l4aau3mwgd8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Riso Carnaroli - Acquerello </strong></p>
<p><strong>Carnaroli rice</strong>, also known as “The Kings’ Rice”, can be dated back to 1945. This variety of rice is traditionally used to prepare risotto, as it offers different characteristics compared to common rice. In fact, its organoleptic structure enables it to remain firm throughout all the cooking process, whilst <u>absorbing the </u><u>flavours</u> of the liquids and fats with which it is prepared.</p>
<p>Acquerello, situated on a meadow that was first built in the 1400s, is the home of the highest quality Carnaroli rice produced in Italy. The Rondolino family introduced a <u>1-year long aging process</u> of the grain, in order to enhance its characteristics. Yes, its as amazing as it sounds!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>Olive Oil - La Bottega (500ml) &amp; Marchionni (250ml)</strong></p>
<p>Both varieties were produced on the hills in the vicinity of Florence, one of <u>Italy’s </u><u>favourite</u><u> regions</u> the for the production of <strong>olive oil</strong>. The two were made with a blend coming from 3 strains of olives, all native to the region - The Frantoio, The Leccino and The Moraiolo. Each strain was thoughtfully combined so to create 2 unique products. These olive oils are characterised by an <u>aromatic</u> and fruity profile, distinguishing themselves by a sweet impression followed by a spicy &amp; bitter ending – ideal both for cooking and raw usage.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510647841/zoonfmi7caz3lre9j3uh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Pelati Tomatoes – Italianavera</strong></p>
<p>With Chef Gasbarro, we decided to bring you this wonderful product of the <strong>Italianavera farm</strong>, because we consider it the flag carrier of excellence when it comes to Italian tomatoes. These incredibly authentic products are <u>entirely organic</u>, with processing systems that take into account the most important safeguards of the product and its organoleptic characteristics. Bringing to your table a truly healthy product. This is a must if you want to cook the best tomato sauce!</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Alici di Cetara - Acquapazza </strong></p>
<p>Anchovies are arguably one of the most loved and used products by Italian families. Flave selected <strong>Acquapazza</strong> as it is a small artisan company consisting of <u>only 5 members</u>, which every year transfer their love and passion towards the making of this phenomenal product. Their work ethic is based on the full respect of the raw material, its seasonality, and fermentation process. They will melt in your mouth!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Pantelleria Capers</strong></p>
<p>The caper plant grows throughout the Mediterranean basin, however, its only in Sicily that it finds its ideal environment. On the wonderful island of <strong>Pantelleria</strong>, capers have been cultivated since the Greek times, providing an exceptional flavour concentration, thanks to the peculiarity of the volcanic soil and to the very favourable climate: moderate windiness and low humidity. These unique climatic and geomorphic circumstances, result in capers that are <u>naturally organic</u> as they do not require any type of treatment or fertilization.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Panforte - Forno di Pianella </strong></p>
<p>Panforte, is a confection that holds all the history and tradition of the charming city of Siena. First written documentations of the “special bread” <u>date back to 1206</u>. They were prepared with care by the nuns of the Montecelso convent, situated in Fontebecci. The Flave Team chose to bring you the Panforte produced by the <strong>Forno di Pianella</strong>, for their great history and tradition in making this unique product. The dough is made out of flour, candied fruits, toasted almonds, 11 spices and honey – to bring you the real Christmas feel!</p>

<h3>Box Design </h3>
<p><u>Our mission is to deliver culinary experiences to your doorstep</u> - in our opinion, this begins with the Box. Since the ingredients represent the Chef's cooking philosophy, we decided that the cover should picture our interpretation of the Chef. For this reason, we decided to dedicate our front cover to <strong>Dante Alighieri</strong>, Founding Father of modern Italian. Just as Chef Gasbarro, Dante had lived all his life in Florence, and until today its one of the city's key symbols. As a matter of fact, the Chef named his 2 menus ""Hell"" &amp; ""Paradise"" as a tribute to Dante's ever dying poem: La Divina Commedia. </p>

The Wilde Beer Team Wilde Beer is proudly a family owned and run Australian business. We have been able to enhance the lives of many thousands of people, as they can now safely enjoy a beer when previously they could not, due to serious digestive issues caused by others beers which contained gluten and FODMAPS. It gives us a thrill to receive the thousands of thank you messages and accolades from grateful drinkers who rave about the taste of our beers.

<p>Bent Brewstillery is on a mission to change the state law to allow Minnesota brewery distilleries — or a combo brewstillery, as we like to call ourselves — to have a brewery taproom and distillery cocktail room under the same ownership and same location.</p>
<p>But just like the battle to allow Sunday sales in Minnesota, this is going to be a fight that needs the support of many of the craft drink community. That’s why we’re asking for you to help us by donating now so we can lead the charge for the change and improvement to state liquors laws. We will be working with a paid lobbyist to write a new law and approaching state law makers to get them onboard to vote for this new law.</p>
<p>“We’re not trying to change the world — just Minnesota,” said Owner and Head Brewstiller Bartley Blume.</p>
<p>According to MN Statute 340A.22 Subd. 2 (e), “No single entity may hold both a cocktail room and taproom license, and a cocktail room and taproom may not be co-located.” </p>
<p>As you may already know, Bent Brewstillery is a brewery and distillery in Roseville, Minn., and the first single-entity brewery distillery to operate in Minnesota. With being the first comes many challenges, including changing irrelevant laws and working with a powerful liquor lobby that fights to keep these laws unchanged.</p>
<p>This liquor control group fails to realize that changing laws has led to great expansion of their industry. The cocktail rooms fuel the demand for the products in bars, restaurants, and liquor stores. Customers try it at the cocktail room, and then seek it out at their favorite retailer. We noticed this phenomenon first-hand with our beer. Once our taproom opened, demand for our beer grew exponentially. It’s really a harmonious relationship set on getting customers the beer and spirits they want.</p>
<p>All Minnesota distilleries are allowed to have a cocktail room to serve their hand-made spirit products.</p>
<p>Why not Bent Brewstillery too?</p>
<p>Your generous donation will help fund our endeavors to change these laws and give you the right to enjoy a delicious Bent Brewstillery cocktail along with your tasty Bent Brewstillery beer. Patrons such as yourself should have the choice to have one or the other at one location — or both, if you’re the adventurous type.</p>
<p>Join our fight to create The Brewstillery Tap-Tail Room Law for us and all other brewstilleries to come later.</p>
<p>Besides backing our endeavor with a generous gift, if you live in Minnesota, please also consider writing to your state representative.</p>

<p>The easiest way is to click on the email link and write them an email. Write from the heart, in your own words. Tell your representative you would like to enjoy a locally-crafted cocktail, made from locally-crafted spirits at your locally-crafted Brewstillery source — just like the micro-breweries, wineries, and micro-distilleries offer.

 The Brick Oven will be the premiere Downtown Salem destination location for signature, Brick oven pizzas, chicken wings, cauliflower ""wings"", salad, mac and cheese,  relaxed indoor atmosphere,  and more.  We will be located in Salem's first and only food hall at ForkForty.  We will be surrounded by other amazing local restaurants and a full bar with communal seating and in the basement there will be Escape Rooms, Break Rooms & more.  We are able to bring high quality healthy eats tot he downtown community and provide a fun and positive atmosphere for everyone and their friends and family!Who am I?I (Amanda) have been in the restaurant business most of life and always have had a soft spot for scratch made pizza.  Eating at many styles of pizzerias, I always knew my all time favorite was brick oven pizza!  Doesn't get much better than that crispy crust that also has that perfect chew.  Feeling like you were in Italy and enjoying the real deal.After opening a mac and cheese shop I ended up choosing to be a full time mom to my new baby so I could give him 100% of my focus.  After moving to Oregon to raise our son, I was itching to get back into the food business.  I decided to open a dessert food cart.  Unfortunately my health declined and I had a death scare, so ultimately we had to let go of that business.  After healing and our son being older, it was time to get back into this industry and ROCK IT!  So we opened Jefferson Bakehouse in our small town of 3k.  We specialize in cinnamon rolls, but we are a full bakery as well.  This opportunity to open a new concept has happened so organically that we cannot ignore the signs to pursue this amazing dream.  I am more than ready to tackle brick oven pizza.  My vision is detailed and full of amazing scratch made foods including wings, cauliflower bites, mac and cheese, baked cauliflower and cheese & salads.  And I am ready to bring them to the town of Salem.  There is nothing like this concept and we are ready to feed everyone this delicious high quality healthy food.Why is it important to me?This campaign is not only important to me, but also our family.  My son Kade aspires to be a chef and own a restaurant some day, and we are able to provide these experiences for him as he grows up.  He is able to learn so much from this business from the food all the way to the numbers.  Having these opportunities for him are similar to the training I had growing up.  I was able to learn both the food and the business side.  For Kade to have the option to have hands on learning as he grows up will really help him in life, even if he pursues other passions.By donating, you are helping provide high quality food for the community and helping us be able to give an experience and you are supporting a family to be able to open a small business.We are proud to provide jobs for people and are passionate about donating to our community through fundraisers. Thank you for reading and helping us get to our $15,000 goal!Where will the money go?With my husband Adam and I learning over the years how to do carpentry, electrical and so much more, we are able to use a lot of the campaign money to buy supplies and save on labor because we will be doing a lot of the construction on our own.  But to get a large commercial brick oven and the rest of the equipment, that will cost a lot of money.  With your help we will be able to achieve getting the best quality equipment to make the best quality pizza and food!The rest of the money will go to permits, licensing and money to pay labor so we can hire an amazing team to run the shop!The food!What makes us different.  We will have farm to plate, chef inspired pizzas using the best ingredients like San Marzano Tomatoes, brick oven roasted garlic and chicken, scratch made pizza dough hand stretched to order & so much more.  Check them out:The New Yorker – Scratch made marinara, mozzarella & fresh grated ParmesanVegan Margherita - Scratch made marinara & fresh basilMargherita - Scratch made marinara, mozzarella, fresh basil The OG – Scratch made marinara, mozzarella, cupping pepperoniThe Butcher – Scratch made marinara, mozzarella, cupping pepperoni, sausage & baconFun Gi - Scratch made marinara, mozzarella, crimini mushrooms, fresh basil & truffle oilMediterranean Chicken (No chicken for vegetarian) - Pesto, scratch made marinara, mozzarella, crimini mushrooms, brick oven roasted chicken, red onion, kalamata olives, fresh basil, feta cheese and roasted garlicPizza salad - your choice of salad on top of our scratch made dough baked with mozzarellaBuild Your OwnWe LOVE pizza and we need YOU!Pizza is about good food, good times and good people. That is the experience we want to give our customers. With your help, we're going to be that much closer to our dream of finally opening a brick oven pizza restaurant like no other.Starting a business, finding amazing employees, creating an amazing line up of pizzas is no easy task. It requires capital, determination, work space, and more.  We are ready to tackle this challenge and everything that comes along with it.Overall we just want to bring amazing quality and healthy ingredients to our community giving them an experience that makes them happy and brings them back for more.Opening a restaurant is one of the hardest ventures a person can do.  However, the fact that we have shown that we can successfully operate food businesses like our first restaurant, the food truck and the bakery, shows that we know how to overcome challenges and make smart decisions.With all of our other concepts, we have used our own capital to fund our operations.  This is going to help so much, raising $15k will get us to the goal line with enough operational capital to finally get the doors open. The funds we raise here will be used for staffing, equipment, building improvements and operations.We are asking for less than we actually need, but we can start out small and grow in our space, as this will surely grow into a well-established location and serve our community and visitors for years to come.Our team has worked hard to bring us to where we are right now and Adam & I have put all of our chips into this venture because we believe in it, deeply.  Help us save the world from boring pizza!This is NOT an all or nothing campaign.  Whatever is donated, we get to use it for opening our pizza shop.WE THANK YOU!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What is Ghost Hawk?</h3>
<p>Ghost Hawk Brewing Company is a collaborative effort between partners Tom Rachelski and Steve Bauer, two Clifton natives with a dream of opening a craft brewery in their hometown.</p>
<p>To realize our vision and ensure an offering of high-quality, locally-crafted beer, we moved on to contract our veteran, award-winning Brewmaster - Chris Sheehan.</p>
<p>The name Ghost Hawk is a tribute to Dan Bauer - brother of Steve and childhood friend of Tom - who passed away in 2016. You can read the full story of our journey, inception, inspiration, and startup at <a href=""https://www.ghosthawkbrewing.com/about-us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.ghosthawkbrewing.com/about-us/</a></p>

<h3>We've hit a few unexpected snags, and need a bit of help.</h3>
<p>We did all of the research you could imagine before diving full-force into this project. But some situations have come to light, deep in the final hours, that are specific to our building and were impossible to plan for in advance.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our seemingly endless saga with the utility company.</h3>
<p>During our planning stages, we discovered early on that our equipment would require a power upgrade from PSE&amp;G. Some of our equipment requires three-phase power to operate, and our building is currently only equipped with single-phase power.</p>
<p>After many months of discussion with their team, we were informed by PSE&amp;G that we would need to contract an independent Electrical Engineer to provide them with a calculated load study. This study required coordination on the part of our contracted engineer, our equipment manufacturer, our equipment supply house, our electrician, and the Ghost Hawk team. After many weeks, we were finally able to provide them with the required data.</p>
<p>Once that was sent over, their engineer visited our location to determine what we needed to move forward. After his review, we were informed that due to our building's specific location, this upgrade would require a new pole and transformer to be installed on our property.</p>
<p>Additionally, it would require the closing and detouring of a busy road with multiple businesses receiving deliveries, along with an access ramp to a major highway. It's a huge logistical project that will involve hiring traffic controllers, planning detours, hiring off-duty police to sit behind utility trucks, materials, and labor costs.. And since our unit is the only one in our building requiring this type of power, the entire upgrade is ALL on our dime.</p>
<p>As if that wasn't enough, they would not work out any type of payment plan with us. We were informed that we would need to pay <u>UP FRONT</u> and <u>IN FULL</u>, or no work would begin. Essentially, we have absolutely no choice but to pay the bill, as we can't operate our business without their upgrade. In late September, they sent us an invoice for <strong>$21,000</strong>. Yes, you read that correctly. <u>Twenty-one thousand dollars</u> that we could have <strong>never</strong> planned for.</p>
<p><strong><i>Between this completely unexpected expense and its related additional costs, we have found ourselves a bit off on our projected start-up costs.</i></strong></p>
<p>We explored the options of taking on another investor, but we have already funded all equipment purchases, secured our lease, and done all of the legwork involved in our startup. So we put our heads together, and decided that a crowdfunding campaign with some really special offerings might just be able to give us the final push that we need.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This brewery is very important for many reasons. As the first brewery in Passaic County, we will certainly be making history here in Clifton. Beyond making beer, Ghost Hawk plans to use it's presence and facility to foster local artists, musicians, small businesses, local culture, and we plan to work with local charities and non-profits.</p>
<p>The Ghost Hawk namesake is a dedication to a fallen brother and friend, who was a very talented and loved member of the local community. We plan to make him proud, and make a positive impact in our area. Your contributions not only earn you some really cool and exclusive offerings, they also allow you to become part of a very special new adventure that is embarking here in Clifton and Northern New Jersey.</p>

<p>It started with a simple idea: to make a spork with a rubber edge.</p>
<p>Zac just wasn't satisfied with the sporks on the market. He vented to Alex about how camping sporks were all basically the same, and they all sorta sucked at being used as eating utensils. He wanted something that would fit any shape - which led to the idea of having a soft, rubbery spoon.</p>
<p>This was probably the first of Zac's countless silly product ideas that had genuinely piqued Alex's interest. The whole product could be simple, elegant, and functional - and they felt that previous attempts at reinventing the spork had fallen short of what a spork could truly be.</p>
<p>They agreed to tackle the Ultimate Spork Project, and set to work. Following a traditional product design process, they began by examining all the things they did and didn't like about current spork tech. They started dreaming of all the ways they could impove the spork. And they spent beer-fueled nights sketching concepts on post-it notes, sorting ideas, and evaluating manufacturing risks and feasibilty for different concepts.</p>
<p>After a lot of heated discussion, emotions, and coffee, they started to focus in on a general design plan. From there, they spent countless hours sketching and hand-carving sleek models out of foam, creating 3d-printed concepts, and working on the design's functionality and manufacturability.</p>

And after a year of serious sporking, we think we've succeeded.Squishy but not sticky, for easy scraping on any surface.
  

 
 

 

 
Eating should never be the crux of an adventure, so our goal is to make eating just a little bit easier, no matter what you're eating out of.
 

 

 

 
Scrape every last bit of food, every single time. More food in your stomach, less cleaning, and less waste.
 

 

 
Morsel's long length is perfect for scraping every last bit of food from your Mountain House meal without getting your hands dirty.
 
Sometimes length matters.
 

 
Morsel is designed to be more versatile and useful than other utensils. Simply put, it's designed to work better.
 

 

 

Choose whatever combination of Morsel shapes and colors you want!
 

(The real-life colors will look even snazzier than the image above)
(Seriously - Alex spent weeks obsessing over real-life color chip samples)
 
 
Pro Tip: Morsel is a perfect gift for anyone who eats food.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Fog Eater Cafe was born out of a years-long dream between Haley and Erica to open a business together, formed after discovering how well they worked together and how closely their business plans and philosophies aligned. Erica moved to Mendocino in the summer of 2016, and Haley moved back the following spring to her hometown of Fort Bragg. The two of them, along with Haley’s husband, Nathan, began writing a business plan and hosting a series of dinner parties at local farms utilizing the magnificent bounty of Northern California. Our new location on Albion Street is right in the heart of Mendocino, in a charming historic building with a beautiful garden patio!</p>
<p>The Fog Eater Cafe will feature ingredient-driven cuisine, exploring the essence of Southern food and drink through the rediscovery of local, organic, and heirloom products. Our menu will be inspired by rich Southern food traditions, but will offer vegetarian fare as an environmentally sustainable and healthy alternative to conventional options. Fog Eater will celebrate the harvest bounty to its fullest, using traditional Southern preservation techniques such as pickling, jam making, and fermenting to offer fresh flavors year-round. Fog Eater will also have a comprehensive baking program, offering such delights as biscuits, cornbread, pies and pastry, with exciting options for allergen-sensitive customers. Simple, straightforward culinary practices will allow the purity of our ingredients to shine through, allowing the bold flavors and comfort of home-style cooking to stay with the customer long after they leave the cafe.</p>
<p>The beverage program will complement the food program. Locally produced wines and beers will be showcased alongside non-alcoholic and  low-octane cocktails made with wild foraged herbs and produce from our Mendocino County farms. Organically grown and naturally produced wines will be prioritized, and the huge array of outstanding local wineries will make for a diverse menu of high quality wines to suit all tastes. Avant-garde techniques such as fat-washing, herbal infusions, and clarification will make the cocktail program shine and perfectly compliment the food. We will have drink specials to draw in a scope of customers, from happy-hour beer specials to cocktails designed to suit an individual’s tastes or mood, and exciting alcohol-free options for our teetotaler guests.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Last Summer, we began to host a series of pop-up dinners, collaborating with local farms to put on four-course farm-to-table dinners with cocktail pairings. The dinners have been extremely well received by the community, selling out upon announcement each time. Now it is time to enter the next phase: a permanent home in the town of Mendocino. We have successfully raised funds for all of the permits, licenses, deposits, furniture, operating costs, dish ware and fixtures. We need an additional 30,000 dollars to cover the remaining cost of the refrigerators, prep tables, freezers, a three-compartment sink, the installation of a zinc-topped bar and... a beautiful hanging sign on Albion Street hand-crafted by the local sign shop.</p>
<p>To sweeten the deal, we are offering a wide range of perks and gifts, from stickers, tote bags, &amp; t-shirts with our logo to free appetizers, desserts, homemade jams and pickles, and private tasting menus specifically catered to you!</p>

<p>The Mendocino Coast has seen an incredible revitalization in the past few years. New farms are opening up, cultivating vegetables and herbs that haven't been present locally for years. Seasonal festivals celebrate the gorgeous bounty of the forest and ocean. The farmer's markets grow substantially each year. The Fog Eater Cafe will showcase this local produce, foraged or grown, proudly sharing to tourists why this place is special while keeping it accessible to the residents of Mendocino County. This restaurant will breathe new life into the community while carrying on the cultural heritage that makes it unique. We need your help to make this dream a reality.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The running of a small restaurant that relies heavily on tourism and a niche market at first seemed an obstacle, but the local support has been quite impressive. Out of the hundreds of people to frequent our events, perhaps a mere 10% have been vegetarian or vegan; the food is just that good.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We are looking for support big and small! Anything you can do to help us on our way to opening in September is appreciated. Have cute old plates you want to donate? Want to work our next event? Have an extra chunk of change you want to invest, but you are looking for a different perk?Want to hire us to cook for your next party?

<h3>The Kola in Mocola</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Kola nut is native to West Africa, where it is chewed as a stimulant and revered among the Igbos of Nigeria as a symbol of hospitality, respect and friendship. Each kola nut contains more caffeine than two cups of coffee. Like cacao, it contains a fair amount of theobromine, which is a much milder but longer lasting stimulant than caffeine.</span></p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Mission</span></h3>
<p>Let's put kola nut on the map! We aim to source our kola nut by working directly with kola nut farmers in our home country, Nigeria. We hope to establish a relationship that not only benefits them financially, but also empowers them to cultivate the highest quality product under sustainable conditions. First, we would like to know what you think about Mocola, so we decided to test our first version of Mocola with this campaign, prior to launching an online store. We are excited to receive your pledges and feedback. Thank you.</p>
<h3>Ties to home</h3>
<p>My name is Valentine Ugo Ezenwa. As a proud Nigerian, based in the US, Mocola is my way of sharing a part of my culture with the world. In this video, I touch on the cultural significance of kola nut to people of my ethnicity, the Igbos of Nigeria. Thank you for supporting this campaign. </p>

Instant and on-the-go - Mocola comes in a box of 14 individual sachets. Mix the powder blend into a cup of hot water.  Add some milk if you want to. Stir and enjoy!

 


Nutritional Label
 
The Kola in Mocola
Kola nut is native to West Africa, where it is chewed as a stimulant and revered among the Igbos of Nigeria as a symbol of hospitality, respect and friendship. Each kola nut contains more caffeine than two cups of coffee. Like cacao, it contains a fair amount of theobromine, which is a much milder but longer lasting stimulant than caffeine.
 


Kola nuts
Fun fact: Kola nut extract was a key ingredient in the original Coca Cola recipe. That's the reason for the ""cola"" in ""Coca Cola"".


Mission
Let's put kola nut on the map! We aim to source our kola nut by working directly with kola nut farmers in our home country, Nigeria. We hope to establish a relationship that not only benefits them financially, but also empowers them to cultivate the highest quality product under sustainable conditions. First, we would like to know what you think about Mocola, so we decided to test our first version of Mocola with this campaign, prior to launching an online store. We are excited to receive your pledges and feedback. Thank you.
Ties to home
My name is Valentine Ugo Ezenwa. As a proud Nigerian, based in the US, Mocola is my way of sharing a part of my culture with the world. In this video, I touch on the cultural significance of kola nut to people of my ethnicity, the Igbos of Nigeria. Thank you for supporting this campaign. 

Start your day with Mocola!

<p>My name is Elena and I am an attorney, entrepreneur, wife, and a mother of two boys and one cat named Kuzma.  For years, I struggled to find a balance between my career and family life.  After a long day at work, I would return home and my kids would want to play with me, but my brain would be completely fried.  I looked for an energy boost but all the products out there looked scary and tasted disgusting. </p>
<p>I felt so guilty for being unable to be there for them, I left my career and spent two wonderful years as a mom, making life-long memories exploring the world with my family.  The above photo is me with my youngest son on a carousel in Paris.  </p>
<p>After returning home, I started a small business with my childhood friend and it unexpectedly blew up. Suddenly, I became very busy again.  Again, I searched for a natural energy product but again came up short.  That's when I decided to create it for myself and others like me.  I collaborated with a company that develops beverages for many major brands.  And I sourced the highest quality matcha green tea from the leading tea experts to create a formula that is powerful, but natural and healthy.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why matcha?</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521762158/pzfwblj5ghowcli72lvp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong><i>L-theanine</i></strong></p>
<p>Matcha is rich with a rare amino acid, L-theanine, which promotes brain relaxation and alertness. Over a thousand years ago, Japanese monks would drink matcha to remain alert yet calm during long hours of meditation. </p>
<p>L-Theanine creates alpha waves, which counteract stress and lead to a state of<i> relaxed alertness</i>. And while L-Theanine is common in all tea, the highest grade of matcha which powers MommyGO contains up to five times more of this amino acid than regular teas. Also, L-Theanine may help memory and learning while inhibiting caffeine's side effects.  A recent study found that matcha even improved physical endurance by 24%. </p>
<p>Thus, MommyGO promotes concentration, increase in energy, and clarity of mind without any of the nervous energy and jitters of coffee and energy drinks. However, not all matcha is the same: there are cheaper varieties that are bitter and far less effective.  Our tea experts made sure that only absolutely the best and the purest ceremonial-grade matcha was used for MommyGO.</p>
<p><strong><i>Antioxidants</i></strong></p>
<p>Matcha tea has many other health benefits. It is packed with <i>far</i> more antioxidants than any other ‘superfood’. (Antioxidants are the body’s defense agents that prevent aging and chronic diseases.) Experts at Tufts University concluded that matcha has an amazing 20 times more ORAC (oxygen radical absorbance capacity) than pomegranates or blueberries. Its ORAC rating is an astonishing 1573 units per gram, compared to pomegranate's 105 or blueberries' 93:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520262264/kezeuspwqkyrcfxwdrtx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><b><i>Other benefits</i></b></p>
<p>In more good news, matcha boosts metabolism <strong>and</strong> burns fat.  At the same time, it doesn’t raise blood pressure or heart rate like most energy beverages. </p>
<h3>What is the money for?</h3>
<p>Because MommyGO has zero artificial preservatives, we faced a dilemma: produce thousands of bottles of natural energy shots and take months to sell them while their power slowly fades away.  Or, essentially pre-sell them via Indiegogo to people who need the energy boost and produce and distribute it all at once, while it's fresh, bristling with antioxidants, and at the peak of its calming energy power.  </p>
<p>The money will go directly to co-packer in Tampa, FL which will order all ingredients and supplies, mix MommyGO and bottle it.  I will be there in person, to make sure the quality what it should be!</p>

<p>The plan is for the factory to deliver production samples by the end of November. Once we approve the samples, the factory will begin production immediately.

<p><br/><strong>How long does it take this to cook a stuffed waffle?</strong></p>
<p>Times vary slightly depending on the batter or interior ingredients, but typically you want to cook your waffle for 2 to 3 minutes on each side. A rule of thumb is to estimate between 5 and 6 minutes of total cook time per waffle.</p>
<p><strong>Have you tried using gluten-free flours to make stuffed waffles with this? If so have you found one kind of flour to be better than another?</strong><br/><br/>Yes, I have used gluten-free flours to make chicken stuffed waffles, palak paneer stuffed waffles, and my kale, feta, and sun-dried tomato stuffed waffles. Most gluten-free flours should work just fine on any kind of stuffed waffle, but the two brands I've used in particular are Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free All Purpose Baking Flour and King Arthur Gluten Free All Purpose Baking Mix, both of which are sold at my local grocery stores. I have only had success with the all-purpose flours. I haven't tried rice or almond flours, but I once tried with a batter made from coconut flour and could never get it to coagulate.</p>
<p><strong>Do I need to use cooking oil?</strong></p>
<p>Even with the natural nonstick pre-seasoning, your waffles may stick to the pan. If this happens, you may not have enough fat or too much sugar in your batter. To avoid sticking, you will want to apply a small amount of cooking oil (either spray or with a brush) before cooking. Repeat this application before every third waffle cooked in succession.</p>
<p><strong>Can I make regular waffles on this?</strong></p>
<p>The waffles made by The Wonderffle Stuffed Waffle Iron do not necessarily have to be cooked with other foods inside. You can use only waffle batter. The waffles, however, will be larger than your typical flat waffles, having a thickness of about 2 ½ inches.</p>
<p><strong>Can't I just use my conventional waffle maker to make stuffed waffles?</strong></p>
<p>The Internet and blogs abound with pictures and recipes for ""stuffed waffles"" or ""waffle sandwiches"" made on a conventional waffle maker. While the cook's skill and creativity are ultimately responsible for a great dish, there are physical limits to today's waffle makers, namely, they're meant to cook something with very little thickness. Try cooking a fried chicken stuffed waffle in your waffle maker at home. Not happening.</p>
<p>Because the Wonderffle Stuffed Waffle Iron makes 2 ½-inch thick waffles, you can fit a substantial amount of food between the batter. It's even better at keeping more liquid ingredients like whipped chocolate or even ice cream inside the waffle without running.</p>
<p><strong>Will this work on my induction stove?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely!</p>
</div></div>","Cooking good food isn't a trivial activity. But for those who like to cook, it's a labor of love. The satisfaction of controlling what goes into the food you and your family eats is worth every minute of effort. What you can make with the Wonderffle Stuffed Waffle Iron is only limited by your creativity. 

 
 
 



 



 




 


 
The Wonderffle Stuffed Waffle Iron has a modular form factor that provides a superior cooking experience, portability, and ease of cleaning and storing.
The design consists of identical top and bottom pans attached by a hinge attached to handles by which the cook flips the entire unit during cooking.
Between the top and bottom pans rests the scissor assembly which adds additional thickness to the waffle, allows the waffle to be removed without touching by hand, and gives the waffle its unique look with the indentions along thickness.

The scissor assembly is so named because the cooked stuffed waffle is released by pulling the handles apart with thumb and fingers in a scissor-like fashion.

Have you tried using gluten-free flours to make stuffed waffles with this? If so have you found one kind of flour to be better than another?Yes, I have used gluten-free flours to make chicken stuffed waffles, palak paneer stuffed waffles, and my kale, feta, and sun-dried tomato stuffed waffles. Most gluten-free flours should work just fine on any kind of stuffed waffle, but the two brands I've used in particular are Bob's Red Mill Gluten Free All Purpose Baking Flour and King Arthur Gluten Free All Purpose Baking Mix, both of which are sold at my local grocery stores. I have only had success with the all-purpose flours. I haven't tried rice or almond flours, but I once tried with a batter made from coconut flour and could never get it to coagulate.
Do I need to use cooking oil?
Even with the natural nonstick pre-seasoning, your waffles may stick to the pan. If this happens, you may not have enough fat or too much sugar in your batter. To avoid sticking, you will want to apply a small amount of cooking oil (either spray or with a brush) before cooking. Repeat this application before every third waffle cooked in succession.
Can I make regular waffles on this?
The waffles made by The Wonderffle Stuffed Waffle Iron do not necessarily have to be cooked with other foods inside. You can use only waffle batter. The waffles, however, will be larger than your typical flat waffles, having a thickness of about 2 ½ inches.
Can't I just use my conventional waffle maker to make stuffed waffles?
The Internet and blogs abound with pictures and recipes for ""stuffed waffles"" or ""waffle sandwiches"" made on a conventional waffle maker. While the cook's skill and creativity are ultimately responsible for a great dish, there are physical limits to today's waffle makers, namely, they're meant to cook something with very little thickness. Try cooking a fried chicken stuffed waffle in your waffle maker at home. Not happening.
Because the Wonderffle Stuffed Waffle Iron makes 2 ½-inch thick waffles, you can fit a substantial amount of food between the batter. It's even better at keeping more liquid ingredients like whipped chocolate or even ice cream inside the waffle without running.
Will this work on my induction stove?

We met in August of 2019, and we both knew immediately that this was setting us up for something different. Within a month of meeting we were already dreaming up business ideas together that united our shared passions. We both loved old and unique buildings, both yearned to build and engage in community, both had mild-to-severe addictions to coffee. We bounced several ideas around; looked at properties in Indianapolis, Elkhart, and Ft. Wayne. Coffee has been a part of these ideas from the beginning, and within a few iterations (and after a short Michigan elopement) we landed solidly on starting a coffee roastery near South Haven, Michigan. </p><p>What we’re doing, here, is building not only our future live + work space, but our future, <i>period</i>. We each traversed two distinctly different paths to get to where we are today: Kiki has collected a wide variety of knowledge and skillsets from a myriad of jobs over the past twenty years. She brings to this endeavor a strong understanding of accounting, business management, design and creativity. I (Luke) have meandered my way through most of my adult life, drinking coffee all the while and seeking to build and foster community. For nearly 6 years I've done that in the classroom; now, I aim to do that with coffee. I started roasting coffee a little over 10 years ago on a thrifted Mr. Popper air Popcorn Popper, and in 2014 sent an email to a guy in Maumee, Ohio that I read about in the newspaper that started a business roasting out of his garage. 6 years later I bought that same roaster from that same guy, and Kiki and I rented a minivan and drove up to get it. </p><p> </p><p><strong>What We Need (hence the 15k)</strong></p><p>With your help, we’ll not only finish building our live + work space up in Michigan, but we’ll be able to avoid seeking traditional investors for our business. This means we’ll be able to pursue our dream the way we want to, and the fruits of our hustle will be ours to harvest. It also means we’ll be able to keep our loans as low as possible (currently 50k), which in turn increases our odds of success. We know this is a gamble, and it’s one we’re willing to go all in on. Any donations that we raise from this campaign will go directly into the business and build. We’ve made a lot of sacrifices and progress to get to where we are today, but we still have another big push ahead of us. <i>Your donations will allow us to move forward with insulation, interior finish of the roastery, and running the electric throughout the building.</i></p><p>That's where we stand - staring squarely at the last three obstacles:</p><p>- Insulation: Complete insulation of the live + work space. We are still gathering quotes, but will likely hire the majority of this task out to a local professional. This is an essential step so that we can begin completing the interior buildout (which includes the following).</p><p>- Electric: This will include everything from purchasing and installing the panel to screwing on the last light switch face plate and everything in between: Romex, conduit, circuit breakers, you name it. An electrician friend of ours is going to help us with this step (we're really embracing this community aspect, here), but we'll be lending a hand (adequately gloved, I promise) at every junction (box). </p><p>- Interior Finish: This is everything from the drywall and paint to light fixtures and sanitization sinks (here we come, Habitat Restore!) to the inspection and certification of the food-safe roastery. We anticipate spending the majority of our weekends from here on out working on this aspect of the build. It'll be our most hands-on part of the project to date, and we are not only ready (tetanus shots pending), but eager - literally counting down the days. </p><p> </p><p><strong>The Stretch Goal (if we go <i>above </i>the 15k)</strong></p><p>If we go above and beyond these immediate needs (fingers crossed), we’ll be putting donations towards:</p><p>- Green Coffee Inventory: Really the sky is the limit here. We’ve been purchasing small amounts of green coffee so far due to the limitations we currently have (money, namely, and storage space - they are currently stored in our landlord’s guest bedroom), but we’d love to get to a point where we can store and roast more varieties and in larger quantities. </p><p>- An espresso machine for the roastery (and/or our coffee truck?!) so that we can develop espresso roasts</p><p>- A commercial range for the roastery so that we can offer vegan croissants and donuts right off the bat instead of waiting around. After all, who wants to wait for vegan donuts? </p><p> </p><p><strong>What You Get</strong></p><p>As a thank you gift for your contribution, we’ll be roasting up some special beans just for you! Additionally, you’ll be among the first core group of folks that get their hands on our new packaging (complete with new label and branding!). For a little more, you can score a Founding Supporter T-Shirt, designed by our newest English mate, a tattoo artist hailing from the UK, and printed by hand here in Indianapolis by the fine folks at Cat Head Press. Also up for grabs is a yearly coffee subscription, a 2-night stay in our future digs, and your very own signature roast. Each gift will come with a hand-written thank you note and a lifetime’s worth of our appreciation, gratitude, and humility.</p><p> </p><p><strong>But what if you don’t meet the goal?</strong></p><p>We’ll figure it out and get there regardless. One of the reasons we chose this platform over one of  the many others out there is that we get your donations even if our overall goal is not met. So, regardless of wether or not we meet that goal, your contributions will go toward all of the projects above (minus, perhaps, the green coffee inventory and espresso machine). We’ve learned a lot of things throughout this process so far, and one of those things is the value of adaptability and dedication. We sold our home, my prized motorcycle, took on summer jobs, and are hustling our wares around Indianapolis as often as we can. For us, it’s just a matter of time until it all works out.</p><p> </p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>I think it’s pretty easy to understand why this project is valuable to us - the creators - but what about the community and world more broadly? For starters, we’re a small business that consistently wants to help support and bolster other small businesses. That’s why we’ve partnered up with our local print shop here in Indy for our T-Shirts, and why we sought out pins and pendants that were made in the good ole’ U.S. of A. We believe in what we’re doing, and we believe in the way we’re going about it. Already, less than 6 months into officially starting the business, we’ve worked directly with a farmer in Honduras to get our hands on some of his crops. Already we’re sacrificing profit margins for the greater good of both our local community and the coffee industry. From the beginning we’ve used environmentally friendly packaging - and our new bags are even more environmentally conscious. We want to help create sustainable businesses and sustainable communities, communities that encourage, challenge, and push one another. A few of our immediate community-centric goals when we move up to Michigan: Start a running club (caffeinated, of course, by Snake Oil Roasters), bring some delicious vegan baked goods to our pop-ups and events, and collaborate with other local businesses on projects that we care about (we’re coming for you, Three Blondes Brewing Company!).</p><p> </p><p><strong>Risks, Challenges, and Covid-19</strong></p><p>Oh, we’re certain there will be (more) risks and challenges, and we’re ready for ‘em. We’ve already encountered a few obstacles along the way, and so far we’ve made it past them. (Who knew, for example, that it would cost us nearly $7,000 to get water to our property? Or that our structure would be ineligible for most new construction loans? Or that Covid-19 would dismantles so many of the traditional retail options for small startups like us?) Additionally, we are both acutely aware that there is an inherent risk, here. How many small businesses make it these days, anyways? But to us, it’s all about the mindset (and opportunities to brainstorm together, and, sure, a few moments of panic and frustration). Again, we’re counting on those past experiences and skillsets to get us through this. Kiki has helped several small businesses find their footing, and has successfully operated her own. I’ve spent the last 3+ years as a founding teacher at a new high school, and sure, while there is a difference between teaching high school students and starting a coffee roastery, there is a lot of overlap, too. We know more challenges are coming, and we’re eager to meet them, hopefully while barefoot standing on the shores of Lake Michigan with a coffee cup in hand.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p><p>Listen: we understand that we’re launching a fundraising campaign in the middle of a pandemic. We know that millions of people have lost their jobs and incomes during this global catastrophe. And while we’re daily thankful for our own jobs and security, we’re also reminded that nothing in life is certain - nothing guaranteed - and that life is too short for us not to step every day toward our dreams. That said, maybe you’re not in a position to donate. That’s okay, there are loads of other ways that you can help us out, each one as meaningful and important to us as the last. Here are just a few ideas: </p><p>Spread the word! Maybe you know someone that likes specialty coffee, or is a vegan, or lives in Michigan near our future roastery, or takes summer trips to South Haven and might be interested in joining the running club some Sunday morning - the more people that are aware of us and what we’re doing, the better!</p><p>Share our story! Again, the more the merrier! Share our campaign, our Instagram, our coffee, emails, phone numbers - anything! This is a grassroots affair, and we need all the help we can get!</p><p>Know your way around HVAC systems? Are you an expert painter? Want to help us get those new fence post holes dug? If you’ve got the heart and willingness to come and aid in some of these labor intensive projects, let us know!</p><p>Did you recently upgrade an appliance? Is your old one sitting in the garage? We’re starting from scratch, here, so that 4 year old washer with the broken knob and finicky sensor looks pret-ty damn good to us! *Note: if your church is getting rid of their old commercial range and you can get us the hook-up, I will cook you elaborate vegan meals literally whenever you want!</p><p>Have a big truck and want to help us move in the Spring? (Or, have a 4x4 beater that would make a great driver for Michigan Winters?) We’ll be making frequent trips, I’m sure - just hit us up!</p></div>","The Beginning of Snake OilThis isn’t a love story, exactly, but there are parts of that here.

One of the reasons we chose this platform over one of  the many others out there is that we get your donations even if our overall goal is not met. So, regardless of wether or not we meet that goal, your contributions will go toward all of the projects above (minus, perhaps, the green coffee inventory and espresso machine). We’ve learned a lot of things throughout this process so far, and one of those things is the value of adaptability and dedication. We sold our home, my prized motorcycle, took on summer jobs, and are hustling our wares around Indianapolis as often as we can. For us, it’s just a matter of time until it all works out. The ImpactI think it’s pretty easy to understand why this project is valuable to us - the creators - but what about the community and world more broadly? For starters, we’re a small business that consistently wants to help support and bolster other small businesses. That’s why we’ve partnered up with our local print shop here in Indy for our T-Shirts, and why we sought out pins and pendants that were made in the good ole’ U.S. of A. We believe in what we’re doing, and we believe in the way we’re going about it. Already, less than 6 months into officially starting the business, we’ve worked directly with a farmer in Honduras to get our hands on some of his crops. Already we’re sacrificing profit margins for the greater good of both our local community and the coffee industry. From the beginning we’ve used environmentally friendly packaging - and our new bags are even more environmentally conscious. We want to help create sustainable businesses and sustainable communities, communities that encourage, challenge, and push one another. A few of our immediate community-centric goals when we move up to Michigan: Start a running club (caffeinated, of course, by Snake Oil Roasters), bring some delicious vegan baked goods to our pop-ups and events, and collaborate with other local businesses on projects that we care about (we’re coming for you, Three Blondes Brewing Company!). Risks, Challenges, and Covid-19Oh, we’re certain there will be (more) risks and challenges, and we’re ready for ‘em. We’ve already encountered a few obstacles along the way, and so far we’ve made it past them. (Who knew, for example, that it would cost us nearly $7,000 to get water to our property? Or that our structure would be ineligible for most new construction loans? Or that Covid-19 would dismantles so many of the traditional retail options for small startups like us?) Additionally, we are both acutely aware that there is an inherent risk, here. How many small businesses make it these days, anyways? But to us, it’s all about the mindset (and opportunities to brainstorm together, and, sure, a few moments of panic and frustration). Again, we’re counting on those past experiences and skillsets to get us through this. Kiki has helped several small businesses find their footing, and has successfully operated her own. I’ve spent the last 3+ years as a founding teacher at a new high school, and sure, while there is a difference between teaching high school students and starting a coffee roastery, there is a lot of overlap, too. We know more challenges are coming, and we’re eager to meet them, hopefully while barefoot standing on the shores of Lake Michigan with a coffee cup in hand. Other Ways You Can HelpListen: we understand that we’re launching a fundraising campaign in the middle of a pandemic. We know that millions of people have lost their jobs and incomes during this global catastrophe. And while we’re daily thankful for our own jobs and security, we’re also reminded that nothing in life is certain - nothing guaranteed - and that life is too short for us not to step every day toward our dreams. That said, maybe you’re not in a position to donate. That’s okay, there are loads of other ways that you can help us out, each one as meaningful and important to us as the last. Here are just a few ideas: Spread the word! Maybe you know someone that likes specialty coffee, or is a vegan, or lives in Michigan near our future roastery, or takes summer trips to South Haven and might be interested in joining the running club some Sunday morning - the more people that are aware of us and what we’re doing, the better!Share our story! Again, the more the merrier! Share our campaign, our Instagram, our coffee, emails, phone numbers - anything! This is a grassroots affair, and we need all the help we can get!Know your way around HVAC systems? Are you an expert painter? Want to help us get those new fence post holes dug? If you’ve got the heart and willingness to come and aid in some of these labor intensive projects, let us know!Did you recently upgrade an appliance? Is your old one sitting in the garage? We’re starting from scratch, here, so that 4 year old washer with the broken knob and finicky sensor looks pret-ty damn good to us! *Note: if your church is getting rid of their old commercial range and you can get us the hook-up, I will cook you elaborate vegan meals literally whenever you want!Have a big truck and want to help us move in the Spring? (Or, have a 4x4 beater that would make a great driver for Michigan Winters?) We’ll be making frequent trips, I’m sure - just hit us up!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I’m Aya Okale-Weeks, owner and lead curator at Meat & Graze. We are a fully licensed and insured specialty catering company offering artisan 'Cheeseperiences' to the wonderful folks in North Carolina’s Triangle, and surrounding areas. A ‘Cheeseperience’ is what we call an appreciation of cheese.  Meat & Graze Cheeseperiences range from mini boxes up to elaborate grazing tables. Meat & Graze is a proudly black and woman-led company, supporting farmers and artisans while making it easier to enjoy aesthetically pleasing artisan cheese and charcuterie arrangements. After using cheese as a catalyst for healing following the murder of my baby brother Joshua, I went on to merge 7+ years of hospitality experience, an entrepreneurial spirit, and everything I've learned about artisan cheese to share these Cheeseperiences with our local community. It is so warming, especially now, to be a part of meals and celebrations through this business. We are COMMITTED to providing the highest quality service and the best-tasting products. Our goal is to open a cheese bar to offer customers a more convenient option for purchasing and enjoying delicious cheese and charcuterie arrangements while getting more connected with our local community.Redefining how we shop, dine, and play, Boxyard RTP is a 15,000 square-foot cargotecture development putting shipping containers to work for small businesses.
