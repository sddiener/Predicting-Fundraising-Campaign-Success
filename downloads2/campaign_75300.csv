<h3>Thank you to everyone that did contribute, Unfortunately Googly was not able to achieve greatness this time. <br/><br/><br/><br/>So what's it all about? (the stubby version)</h3>
<p>My name is Remo Wakeford and from a very young age I’ve taken great pleasure in being creative.  This project is part of that creativity and has subsequently become somewhat of an obsession with me.</p>
<p>I’ve been a Graphic Designer for about 8 years and 4 years ago I obtained a degree in Industrial Design.  During my student days, the Googly Egg Timer concept popped into my head and has never gone away, now the time has come to develop it further.</p>
<p>It's time that Googly joins other kitchen friends and becomes a range, a range of fun loving and brilliantly inspiring accessories for your kitchen!  Accessories like egg cups, salad spoons, bottle openers, ice trays and even dry food containers. Whether you have kids or not, the Googly Egg Timer will find a place in your heart and your home.</p>
<p>The reason I've come here is to make the Googly timer concept a reality.</p>
<p><strong><em>That’s where you come in!</em></strong></p>
<p>I would just love to see Googly on store shelves and know that people are enjoying his happy face in their homes. Help me bring his cuteness into your life by contributing what you can to his birth.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.freedomdesign.co.za/images/IndieGogoInlineImage_1.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/></p>
<strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What Googly needs to exist! </span></strong><p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I've been approached by an investor who is very keen on the Googly concept BUT they have requested that I generate more than a single item, rather a range of kitchen accessories like the ones I mentioned above.  The reasoning is that an entire range of products will be more acceptable to the market.</p>
<p>So, in order for Googly to exist, I need to be able to develop and make prototypes of his friends and family (as I think of them) as an integrated group of products. This requires financial resources that I don’t have available, for example, Googly himself cost €300.00 to prototype, that’s without any finishing, polishing or painting. </p>
<p>So, in order to make another 4 buddies it's going to take at least €1200.00 before finishing, add the finishing and I estimate a total cost of about €3500.00.  </p>
<p>A portion of the funds will go towards a prototyping budget, paying for the parts, the time and the finishing of each of the buddies, while the balance will go towards the exciting rewards that you, as a special founder member of the Googly club, will get.     </p>
<p><img alt=""Images of the prototyping process"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.freedomdesign.co.za/images/IndieGogoInlineImage_5.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Prototyping""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.freedomdesign.co.za/images/IndieGogoInlineImage_6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">What being part of the Googly club means!</span></strong>
<p> </p>
<p>   </p>
<p>Being in the Googly club is an exclusive accomplishment reserved for those of you that really want to brighten up your lives!</p>
<p>At each level of investment in the Googly project you get different club perks all of which are truly awesome. Although to be fair, those that give more will receive a bit more “awesomeness”.</p>
<p>When you contribute €5.00 you become a <strong><em>copper member</em></strong> of the Googly Club which entitles you to a special mention in the “Googly Founding Fathers” page on the soon to be Googly website. </p>
<p>When you contribute €15.00 you become a <strong><em>bronze member</em></strong> of the Googly Club which entitles you to a special mention in the “Googly Founding Fathers” page on the website and not only that, you will receive a postcard of the Googly Signed by me, the original designer.    </p>
<p>When you contribute €50.00 you become a <strong><em>silver member</em></strong> of the Googly Club which entitles you to a special mention in the “Googly Founding Fathers” page on the website, a postcard of the Googly Signed by me, the original designer and along with that awesomeness you also get a limited edition Googly keyring made using the latest rapid prototyping techniques and hand finished by me the designer.</p>
<p>When you contribute €100.00 you become a <strong><em>gold member</em></strong> of the Googly Club which entitles you to a special mention in the “Googly Founding Fathers” page on the website and that's not all!!!! You also get a limited edition book featuring all the original sketches and concept development artwork, signed by me, the original designer.</p>
<p>When you contribute €500.00 you become a <strong><em>platinum member</em></strong> of the Googly Club which entitles you to a special mention in the “Googly Founding Fathers” page on the website and along with your addition to the list of awesome people, Googly will cross your palm with a limited edition stainless steel keyring made by using some of the latest rapid prototyping techniques.  But wait there's more! With this investment comes an exclusive and once in a lifetime opportunity to get your hands on a prototype Googly, in its packaging and supplied with a certificate of authenticity! This googly is hand finished by me the original designer.</p>
<p>If you're as passionate as me about this project and you contribute €1000.00 or more, you become a <strong><em>diamond member</em></strong> of the Googly Club and to separate you from everyone else you not only get your hands on a prototype Googly but you get to choose whether you want the standard purple and green Googly or the more classic black and red version which also comes in its packaging with a certificate of authenticity! This googly is hand finished by me the original designer. And you also get to add a signed copy of the limited edition book featuring all the original sketches and concept development artwork as well as the limited edition stainless steel keyring to add to your collection of awesome things. </p>

<p><img alt=""Timer front and back"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.freedomdesign.co.za/images/IndieGogoInlineImage_2.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Timer Front and Back""/></p>
<p> </p>
<strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">So what happens if Googly doesn't make it?</span></strong>
<p>If Googly doesn't make it?! well lets hope that doesn't happen! But if it does I'll do what I can to give what's been promised. After that I'll just have to go back to polishing shoes on the streets of Dublin to generate some extra cash, so that Googly can be born.</p>

<h3>
<span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">T</span><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">he Impact</span>
</h3>
<p>This project is something that is not only close to my heart but something I believe will help generate a new accessory company with a fresh flavor that has a similar design philosophy to Alessi, the post-modern, high design, Italian kitchen utensil company.   Not only that but a design firm that can give back to society by generating affordable, fun and functional designer products. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">Other Ways You Can Help!</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>If you can't contribute right now thats ok, just make sure you tell your friends, family, colleagues, aquaintances, ex's, teachers, lecturers, local police, the post office and literally anyone you can about this project. I've included a little card below that you can print out and give to people so that they can check it out. Also Indiegogo has many sharing tools that you can use to let your social network buddies find out about the awesome Googly.</p>
<p> </p>

I would just love to see Googly on store shelves and know that people are enjoying his happy face in their homes. Help me bring his cuteness into your life by contributing what you can to his birth.

What Googly needs to exist! 


I've been approached by an investor who is very keen on the Googly concept BUT they have requested that I generate more than a single item, rather a range of kitchen accessories like the ones I mentioned above.  The reasoning is that an entire range of products will be more acceptable to the market.
So, in order for Googly to exist, I need to be able to develop and make prototypes of his friends and family (as I think of them) as an integrated group of products. This requires financial resources that I don’t have available, for example, Googly himself cost €300.00 to prototype, that’s without any finishing, polishing or painting. 
So, in order to make another 4 buddies it's going to take at least €1200.00 before finishing, add the finishing and I estimate a total cost of about €3500.00.  
A portion of the funds will go towards a prototyping budget, paying for the parts, the time and the finishing of each of the buddies, while the balance will go towards the exciting rewards that you, as a special founder member of the Googly club, will get.     

 

 
What being part of the Googly club means!
 
   
Being in the Googly club is an exclusive accomplishment reserved for those of you that really want to brighten up your lives!
At each level of investment in the Googly project you get different club perks all of which are truly awesome. Although to be fair, those that give more will receive a bit more “awesomeness”.
When you contribute €5.00 you become a copper member of the Googly Club which entitles you to a special mention in the “Googly Founding Fathers” page on the soon to be Googly website. 
When you contribute €15.00 you become a bronze member of the Googly Club which entitles you to a special mention in the “Googly Founding Fathers” page on the website and not only that, you will receive a postcard of the Googly Signed by me, the original designer.    
When you contribute €50.00 you become a silver member of the Googly Club which entitles you to a special mention in the “Googly Founding Fathers” page on the website, a postcard of the Googly Signed by me, the original designer and along with that awesomeness you also get a limited edition Googly keyring made using the latest rapid prototyping techniques and hand finished by me the designer.
When you contribute €100.00 you become a gold member of the Googly Club which entitles you to a special mention in the “Googly Founding Fathers” page on the website and that's not all!!!! You also get a limited edition book featuring all the original sketches and concept development artwork, signed by me, the original designer.
When you contribute €500.00 you become a platinum member of the Googly Club which entitles you to a special mention in the “Googly Founding Fathers” page on the website and along with your addition to the list of awesome people, Googly will cross your palm with a limited edition stainless steel keyring made by using some of the latest rapid prototyping techniques.  But wait there's more! With this investment comes an exclusive and once in a lifetime opportunity to get your hands on a prototype Googly, in its packaging and supplied with a certificate of authenticity! This googly is hand finished by me the original designer.
If you're as passionate as me about this project and you contribute €1000.00 or more, you become a diamond member of the Googly Club and to separate you from everyone else you not only get your hands on a prototype Googly but you get to choose whether you want the standard purple and green Googly or the more classic black and red version which also comes in its packaging with a certificate of authenticity! This googly is hand finished by me the original designer. And you also get to add a signed copy of the limited edition book featuring all the original sketches and concept development artwork as well as the limited edition stainless steel keyring to add to your collection of awesome things. 
 

 
So what happens if Googly doesn't make it?
If Googly doesn't make it?! well lets hope that doesn't happen! But if it does I'll do what I can to give what's been promised. After that I'll just have to go back to polishing shoes on the streets of Dublin to generate some extra cash, so that Googly can be born.
  


The Impact

This project is something that is not only close to my heart but something I believe will help generate a new accessory company with a fresh flavor that has a similar design philosophy to Alessi, the post-modern, high design, Italian kitchen utensil company.   Not only that but a design firm that can give back to society by generating affordable, fun and functional designer products. 
 
Other Ways You Can Help!


If you can't contribute right now thats ok, just make sure you tell your friends, family, colleagues, aquaintances, ex's, teachers, lecturers, local police, the post office and literally anyone you can about this project. I've included a little card below that you can print out and give to people so that they can check it out. Also Indiegogo has many sharing tools that you can use to let your social network buddies find out about the awesome Googly.
 

Oh and before I sign off, Googly thanks you! from the bottom of his soon to be real heart!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We think it’s crazy that in this day and age, millions of people in poor countries suffer from debilitating medical conditions that can be treated with a simple surgery. </p>
<p>So we teamed up to do something about it. Samahope, a website we’re building, lets you change a person's life for just a few dollars by funding his or her procedure. We focus on surgeries that are low cost, have a high rate of success, and create major life impact for the patient, including treatment for burns, cleft palate, and obstetric fistula. You can learn all about the procedures we fund <a href=""https://www.samahope.org/about.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. </p>
<h3>How it Works</h3>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/471738/pictures/full/20121002213940-samahope-angle.jpg?1349239185"" src="""" style=""margin-right: 5px; float: left;""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>1. We choose great partners</strong><br/>We vet local clinics and hospitals in poor communities with a track record of excellent care using a combination of interviews, analysis of the clinic’s financial information, publicly available reviews on leading charity watchdog sites, and on-site visits.<br/><br/><strong>2. Users fund real patients</strong><br/>Approved partners post profiles of real patients who have recently received or are awaiting a surgery. Visitors to Samahope choose patients they’d like to fund and donate via PayPal or credit card. Thanks to the support of a few early donors and our “tip jar” system, 100% of users’ donations go to the surgical partner for conducting the procedure.<br/><br/>Each month, we collect donations for each patient and send them to the partner performing the surgery. Our partners posts updates on a regular basis to allow donors to track the progress of the surgeries they have funded.<br/><br/><strong>3. We ensure donors’ money is well spent</strong><br/>We conduct frequent site and patient audits using a combination of staff and volunteer field visits to guarantee all information on the site is accurate, to the best of our knowledge. With fewer than 1,000 surgeries on Samahope, we are able to audit 10% or more of all surgeries. As the site scales, we will adjust our audit sample size accordingly. For a list of current patient audits, please refer to Tab 2 of our <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkbVk2dNUy2-dEdueEYxVjFGbU1FM0JCQVo5YjJ5RUE#gid=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">transparency document.</a></p>
<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>We are an all-volunteer team that believes technology and direct giving can dramatically reduce suffering around the world. Leila is a social entrepreneur who founded <a href=""http://www.samasource.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Samasource</a> four years ago. While in Sierra Leone last year, Leila met Dr. Maggi, a retired Texan OB/GYN who was performing 200 volunteer surgeries each year and fundraising on his own. When she returned home, she called Shawn, who had recently visited Sierra Leone and assisted Dr. Maggi with website and database work. Together, the two came up with the idea for Samahope.

<h3>With Your Help</h3>
<p>We need your help to make Samahope happen. With $50,000, we plan to scale by:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Adding new partners - </strong>we’ll hire a part-time staff member to help us interview and vet new partner organizations.</li>
<li>
<strong>Adding 1,000 more surgeries -</strong> we’ll recruit 5 volunteers to visit partners on site to load patient profiles into the system and validate patient information with partial travel stipends.</li>
<li>
<strong>Marketing the site widely to potential donors -</strong> we’ll retain a fantastic PR and marketing agency or contract professional at a discounted rate to spread awareness of what we do through social media, our blog, and advertising.</li>
<li>
<strong>Working together as a team -</strong> we are currently all volunteers. We do most of our work on Skype and in Google Hangouts, but occasionally, we need to meet face-to-face. A modest travel budget would allow Shivani (who lives in NYC) to travel to California to meet up with Shawn and Leila (who live in LA and SF) several times in the next year. This would also allow us to visit other field partners.</li>
</ul><p>If this campaign exceeds our wildest dreams and raises over $100,000, we’ll be able to invest in a solid team that can do so much more:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Improving the user experience -</strong> we’ll invest more in site development to make Samahope faster and easier to use; build a better email and communications system with donors (personalized updates on each patient); and build stronger donor marketing campaigns targeted to major life events (such as weddings, birthdays, and having a baby).</li>
<li>
<strong>Improving the partner interface -</strong> we can create and provide robust reporting and administrative tools for partners, making it easy for partners to share and work with Samahope.</li>
<li>
<strong>Creating stronger profiles of patients -</strong> we'll add video profiles, add the ability to update profiles with post-surgery information, and explore better ways to connect directly with patients.</li>
<li>
<strong>Adding 5,000 more surgeries to the site -</strong> we'll add substantially more surgeries to the site.</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Crowdfunding has radically changed the funding landscape for startups, medical innovation, creative projects, nonprofits, and even schools. Why not share the benefits of this model with the millions of people who need medical treatment but can’t afford it, by funding their surgeries?</p>
<p>We’ve built a site that does exactly that. Samahope could close the gap in funding for women who can’t afford to treat painful conditions arising from giving birth, and for children who are disfigured from burns or cleft palate. With your support, Samahope could grow into a platform for funding all kinds of treatable medical problems.<br/><br/>Our team will make this happen. Shawn has worked as an engineer for over a decade, building websites and technology solutions for leading companies including Allstate. Shivani, a former product manager, launched and marketed successful products at Microsoft and the Grameen Foundation. Leila built Samasource, an innovative social business, into a global operation with 3,000 workers in East Africa and South Asia.</p>
<h3>Thank You + Ways to Get Involved</h3>
<p>We are grateful for any support you can offer to get Samahope off the ground. Giving to our campaign at any level sends a signal to your friends that you care about fixing the funding problem for medical treatment for the poor.</p>
<p>We invite you to help us spread our message online and offline to your friends and family. Please use Indiegogo’s helpful share tools to create a ripple effect with your gift.</p>

We think it’s crazy that in this day and age, millions of people in poor countries suffer from debilitating medical conditions that can be treated with a simple surgery. 
So we teamed up to do something about it. Samahope, a website we’re building, lets you change a person's life for just a few dollars by funding his or her procedure. We focus on surgeries that are low cost, have a high rate of success, and create major life impact for the patient, including treatment for burns, cleft palate, and obstetric fistula. You can learn all about the procedures we fund here. 
How it Works

1. We choose great partnersWe vet local clinics and hospitals in poor communities with a track record of excellent care using a combination of interviews, analysis of the clinic’s financial information, publicly available reviews on leading charity watchdog sites, and on-site visits.2. Users fund real patientsApproved partners post profiles of real patients who have recently received or are awaiting a surgery. Visitors to Samahope choose patients they’d like to fund and donate via PayPal or credit card. Thanks to the support of a few early donors and our “tip jar” system, 100% of users’ donations go to the surgical partner for conducting the procedure.Each month, we collect donations for each patient and send them to the partner performing the surgery. Our partners posts updates on a regular basis to allow donors to track the progress of the surgeries they have funded.3. We ensure donors’ money is well spentWe conduct frequent site and patient audits using a combination of staff and volunteer field visits to guarantee all information on the site is accurate, to the best of our knowledge. With fewer than 1,000 surgeries on Samahope, we are able to audit 10% or more of all surgeries. As the site scales, we will adjust our audit sample size accordingly. For a list of current patient audits, please refer to Tab 2 of our transparency document.
Who We Are
We are an all-volunteer team that believes technology and direct giving can dramatically reduce suffering around the world. Leila is a social entrepreneur who founded Samasource four years ago. While in Sierra Leone last year, Leila met Dr. Maggi, a retired Texan OB/GYN who was performing 200 volunteer surgeries each year and fundraising on his own. When she returned home, she called Shawn, who had recently visited Sierra Leone and assisted Dr. Maggi with website and database work. Together, the two came up with the idea for Samahope. They soon roped in Shivani, an experienced program manager who had just quit her job at McKinsey, to help scale the site and launch it. Along the way, we convinced Jessica Jackley, co-founder of Kiva, to sign on as an advisor. To ignite the operation, an initial donation of $25,000 was provided by one of Leila’s board members to cover a portion of our startup costs.

<p><em>* The following text is my response to an application question posed by the Tanzania Children’s Fund before accepting me as a volunteer at The Rift Valley Children’s Village.  </em></p>
<p>     Children are extraordinary gifts. Their exceptional ability to adapt to their environment and harness genuine creativity baffles me to no end. In my personal experience, children crave growth when they're settled into a stimulating learning environment, and later on, radiate when they share what they’ve learned. I think the material taught in a classroom can be a key to unlocking endless opportunities.</p>
<p>    More importantly, these environments that nurture education offer a safe space for people to learn and practice empathy, respect and support.</p>
<p>    Bringing caregivers from other cultures into a classroom can provide an important mentor-pupil relationship. I believe it could introduce a thrilling dynamic of culture and support. Hopefully there could be an open forum around the exchange of culture, which is a lesson better learned firsthand.</p>
<p>    I am a Bachelors of Fine Art graduate photography major from the University of Manitoba (class of 2011). While I am volunteering at The Rift Valley Children's Village in Tanzania I plan on taking thousands of photographs documenting my stay at RVCV and the breathtaking landscape around me.</p>

<p>2) <em>Silver &amp; Bronze Editions</em>: Respective sponsor will have access to all photos (excluding gold edition), and choose one from that selection.</p>
<p><em>NOTE* All photographs (unless options are requested) will be sent via email, with a fixed resolution, as a digital negative, so you may print the photo at any photo lab near you.

MIT's Living Wage Project says a single adult needs at least $11.31/hr to live in Massachusetts and almost $13/hr to live in Boston. If you care for a child or a spouse, the cost nearly doubles.What's the minimum wage in Massachusetts? $8/hr. In order to simply live, working people have to find two jobs, leave their children while working, or forgo higher education - anything to make ends meet. Right now, 11% of the state lives in poverty. In Boston, the poverty rate is a staggering  21.2%. Massachusetts doesn't have to be this way - with a living wage, we can lift each other out of poverty, feed our families, save money for school, and build a civil society that America deserves.15 Now is a national movement organized by working people to fix issues that affect us. We can't live off of $8/hr, we need a living wage of $15/hr. Thanks to hundreds of volunteers, 15 Now was able to push and win $15 in Seattle. Now we're looking to do the same in Massachusetts!(Don't live in Massachusetts? See our sister campaign in Philly or our national campaign!)

<p>Hi. My name is Camellia and I would like to combine my life's passion--giving--with a a sustainable money-making idea. The Missions Depot is an entrepreneurial effort, a thrift store in which the proceeds raised will go to benefit relief and missions efforts locally, nationally and abroad.</p>
<p>For more than 20 years I have been involved in, helped to fund and even initiated all kinds of relief and missions-minded efforts from projects involving jails, nursing homes, and hospitals to shelters and orphanages. I have both traveled the globe and worked diligently wherever my hands could find to minister and be a blessing here in the United States. Now I would like to open a ""station"" where goods are bought, sold, traded, and consigned so that various projects can continue to be funded throughout the world!</p>
<p>The Missions Depot will always demonstrate that the more you give the more you receive. We will accept gently used donations of all sorts of items, then resell them at unbeatable prices. Customers leave with the amazing feeling of purchasing something valuable for little money, PLUS the thrill of knowing that the bulk of their dollar is going to help people across the globe.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I have been incredibly blessed to be found missions and relief efforts for many years, organizing community efforts like Dinner for a Dollar; church outreaches like clothing giveaways; and humanitarian efforts like Blankets for Babiesin which crochets mini-blankets were donated to NICU's in various cities.

<p>Having said that I want to be clear that proceeds raised from the Missions Depot will NEVER be limited to helping people in one particular country.  Donors, sponsors, and patrons are ALWAYS invited and encouraged to keep us abreast of where goods and funds are most needed in the world at any given time.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Hi, I'm Adrian, I moved from New York to S. Florida three years ago. As a hobby and a way to make new friends, I started running unique and creative group events in S. Florida to get out of the bored rut. After a while it took on a life of its own. Once I started our first few events and saw how much fun it was bringing strangers together, it fueled my obsession of doing this on a much broader scale. It brings me great joy when members rave about how much fun they had, or how they met a new friend at one of our events. This funding will help me start a massive marketing campain. Thus allowing for many new members in your area and expanding into several new cities. Look for us in your city soon.</p>
<p>You can see pictures and types of events at <a href=""http://www.MeetMeThereEvents.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.MeetMeThereEvents.com</a></p>
<p>Before moving I owned an event planning business in NYC for over 18 years. Having worked for clients who where planning such important private events, I became highly skilled in being detailed oriented, diligent, resourceful and creative. After exiting the private party world, I went on to become a Licensed Realtor for RE/MAX. But, they say, ""Do what you love and you'll love what you do"". Well, I love running this group and want to do it full time. I've never had so much fun in my life creating fun for other people.</p>

To bring ""Meet Me There Events"" social activities to life full time. $5 or $10 is all will take to get it started. Here's my story
Short Summary
Hi, I'm Adrian, I moved from New York to S. Florida three years ago. As a hobby and a way to make new friends, I started running unique and creative group events in S. Florida to get out of the bored rut. After a while it took on a life of its own. Once I started our first few events and saw how much fun it was bringing strangers together, it fueled my obsession of doing this on a much broader scale. It brings me great joy when members rave about how much fun they had, or how they met a new friend at one of our events. This funding will help me start a massive marketing campain. Thus allowing for many new members in your area and expanding into several new cities. Look for us in your city soon.
You can see pictures and types of events at www.MeetMeThereEvents.com
Before moving I owned an event planning business in NYC for over 18 years. Having worked for clients who where planning such important private events, I became highly skilled in being detailed oriented, diligent, resourceful and creative. After exiting the private party world, I went on to become a Licensed Realtor for RE/MAX. But, they say, ""Do what you love and you'll love what you do"". Well, I love running this group and want to do it full time. I've never had so much fun in my life creating fun for other people.
Your contributions are actually not for me. They are for the members. As they are the recipients of this service. Life is filled with work, families, stress, bills and plenty of adult seriousness. Members need our group as an outlet to express their inner kid and to have more laughter and enjoyment in their lives. Because we do these as group events, they benefit by meeting many new friends that they wouldn't normally meet in their daily lives.
What We Need & What You Get
$25,000 is what it would take to get it started. I have been out of pocket for all costs associated with running this group. However, I have devised a very affordable member fee that helps in the cost of running the group. It's extremely affordable with no pressure to participate if they can't. Unlike a similar group who charges over 100 times what we do. Plus, they limit the membership to a year. Once our members pay a onetime fee, they are members for life.
A small portion would be for legal fees. Incorporation fees, liability agreement, a few web page enhancements etc.. The Majority, approximately $20,000, would be used to run radio spots for approximately 8 - 10 months consistently. It would not be spent all at once. Between, $1,500 and $2,000 a month would be spent on this marketing. This would allow for consistency and more importantly, letting me see the conversion rate after 90 days. The marketing will drve traffic to our web site and increase membership.
If the goal is not met, I will still use the funds in the same manner and begin marketing. I will work hard as continuing to raise the balance from angels and out of pocket myself.
One perk offered to any contributor would be a complimentary membership.

This tragic accident struck our small farming community and we grieve for this beautiful, sweet boy who had to leave us much too soon. Dustun was a very loving, caring young boy who embraced life and loved those around him. He lived in the small town of Blaine, Tennessee with his aunt and uncle, John and Sandy Bernard who raised him as a son, and his two sisters as well as three cousins who loved him like a brother.</p>
<p>Sadly, tragedies like these incur many expenses. No one expects something like this to happen to someone so young, and we want to extend our sympathies and give them the help that Dustun and they deserve. Proceeds will go to the family to cover funeral expenses and additional expenses incurred due to the accident. This fundraiser would help to ease the burdens on a grieving family.</p>
<p>Dustun was a very active member of his church and their youth group. He lived to make those around him smile and our community aches for him and for his family. Dustun’s presence in this world made it a better place and it is dimmer for him having gone so soon. </p>
<p>Dustun was my baby sister's boyfriend and he means a lot to our family. He made her the happiest girl on earth and we want to offer his family all of the support and comfort that they deserve. </p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span>We were inspired to do this project because staying local is so important to retaining the culture of our communities.  Some of the benefits of having local mom &amp; pop businesses include...</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>They employ more people than chains</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>Keep twice as much of the money in the local area</span></p>
</li>
</ul><ul>
<li dir=""ltr""><span>Nearby home value increases 50% faster</span></li>
</ul><p dir=""ltr"">Not to mention they create a more vibrant community to live in.  Yet compared to 10 years ago, there are 300,000 fewer mom &amp; pop businesses in America (U.S. Census Data).  </p>
<p dir=""ltr"">We seek to use mobile technology to help the remaining 1.2 million of these businesses stay competitive.  84% of small businesses with a mobile presence report increased sales<em>...yet only 14% maintain a mobile presence.  </em></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>That’s why we created Domino Street especially for mom &amp; pop establishments - to promote themselves in an easy time-efficient way while simultaneously providing locals with a rich, experiential way to stay in touch with their neighborhood.  Domino Street quickly answers, </span>""What's happening right now?"" or ""What's going-on this weekend?""</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">To make it even more powerful and easy for mom &amp; pop businesses, we’ve created special tools (i.e. the Domino Merchant App) which allows them to upload content directly to Domino Street, their Facebook page, and their Twitter stream...all in a matter of seconds using their smartphone.</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span><em>If you’re a Small Business Owner: </em></span><em>We’d LOVE to hear from you! Please sign-up on our <a href=""http://www.dominostreetapp.com/signup/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a> so we can add your business when we roll-out Domino Street and the Domino Merchant App to your neighborhood.</em></p>
<h2 dir=""ltr""><strong>The Domino Street App:</strong></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We want to create something to allow people to experience what’s going on around them.  We know from the success of photo sharing apps, that rich imagery is a powerful way to accomplish this.  </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We aim to build a super easy, almost playful way to browse what’s new, relevant, and fresh in your neighborhood.  We’re not a deals app, we’re not an events app, nor are we a curated guide.   We are simply an app that connects you to what’s happening in your neighborhood.</span></p>

<h2 dir=""ltr""><strong>How we’ll complete our project:</strong></h2>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>- Domino has already created mobile experiences for events such as <a href=""http://dominobrooklyn.com/2012/03/shop-drop-drink/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Shop, Drop &amp; Drink"">Shop, Drop &amp; Drink</a>, <a href=""http:/vintagecrawl.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Vintage Crawl"">The Vintage Crawl</a>, and <a href=""http://www.brooklynflea.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""the Brooklyn Flea"">the Brooklyn Flea</a>. We are a team of 10 people - designers, technologists, and people with passion around local events, arts, and fashion.</span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>- We have submitted a prototype of Domino Street to the App Store which we are planning to test in our local neighborhood of Williamsburg starting Sept 12th. Where we need help is to make this available to all neighborhoods. To do that, we have to rework our technology somewhat. This includes a redesign of the front end to allow users to hop between neighborhoods. We need to also build an android version of the app, as well as add a few features that did not make it into the prototype.  We also need to build a scalable backend that can support a large number of users and small businesses using the app. Finally we will need to pay for promotional materials and on-the-ground forces.  </span></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><span>We estimate this will cost about $30k (we raise $28k on hitting a $35k goal), but could use a bit more.  </span>We expect the upgrades and expansion to take about 4-6 weeks once we are funded enough to begin work.</p>

<div> </div></div>","What’s this all about?
We were inspired to do this project because staying local is so important to retaining the culture of our communities.  Some of the benefits of having local mom & pop businesses include...


They employ more people than chains


Keep twice as much of the money in the local area


Nearby home value increases 50% faster
Not to mention they create a more vibrant community to live in.  Yet compared to 10 years ago, there are 300,000 fewer mom & pop businesses in America (U.S. Census Data).  
We seek to use mobile technology to help the remaining 1.2 million of these businesses stay competitive.  84% of small businesses with a mobile presence report increased sales...yet only 14% maintain a mobile presence.  
That’s why we created Domino Street especially for mom & pop establishments - to promote themselves in an easy time-efficient way while simultaneously providing locals with a rich, experiential way to stay in touch with their neighborhood.  Domino Street quickly answers, ""What's happening right now?"" or ""What's going-on this weekend?""
To make it even more powerful and easy for mom & pop businesses, we’ve created special tools (i.e. the Domino Merchant App) which allows them to upload content directly to Domino Street, their Facebook page, and their Twitter stream...all in a matter of seconds using their smartphone.
If you’re a Small Business Owner: We’d LOVE to hear from you! Please sign-up on our website so we can add your business when we roll-out Domino Street and the Domino Merchant App to your neighborhood.
The Domino Street App:
We want to create something to allow people to experience what’s going on around them.  We know from the success of photo sharing apps, that rich imagery is a powerful way to accomplish this.  
We aim to build a super easy, almost playful way to browse what’s new, relevant, and fresh in your neighborhood.  We’re not a deals app, we’re not an events app, nor are we a curated guide.   We are simply an app that connects you to what’s happening in your neighborhood.

 
 
What’s in the app?


Eat + Drink: Chalkboard specials, happy hours, new cocktails


Shop: New Merchandise, Current Sales, promote In-store events


Culture: Event based - Music concerts, Art openings, Movie Night, Food Festival, etc.

Snap Deal: Users take a picture of an item & post to Facebook/Twitter = unlock existing eCoupon

 


How we’ll complete our project:
- Domino has already created mobile experiences for events such as Shop, Drop & Drink, The Vintage Crawl, and the Brooklyn Flea. We are a team of 10 people - designers, technologists, and people with passion around local events, arts, and fashion.
- We have submitted a prototype of Domino Street to the App Store which we are planning to test in our local neighborhood of Williamsburg starting Sept 12th. Where we need help is to make this available to all neighborhoods. To do that, we have to rework our technology somewhat. This includes a redesign of the front end to allow users to hop between neighborhoods. We need to also build an android version of the app, as well as add a few features that did not make it into the prototype.  We also need to build a scalable backend that can support a large number of users and small businesses using the app. Finally we will need to pay for promotional materials and on-the-ground forces.  
We estimate this will cost about $30k (we raise $28k on hitting a $35k goal), but could use a bit more.  We expect the upgrades and expansion to take about 4-6 weeks once we are funded enough to begin work.
Where will the money go?

68% Tech / UX development ($23,800)

Make prototype stable & usable in any neighborhood in U.S.
Create Android versions for Domino Street and Merchant App
Improve backend to support more features and handle greater user load
Add additional nav features (sorting/search/vendor bookmarks)
Create additional filters for merchants to use
Create Domino Street plugin for local websites
Build Merchant web portal 
Create feed of 3rd party music events directly into app
Upgrade maps
Maintain Servers for 1 year


15% Outreach & Promotion ($5,250)   

Printing of promo materials
Dedicated on-the-ground merchant outreach
Hire temp personnel for distribution 



10% Rewards ($3,500)

7% Indiegogo / processing fees ($2,450)
Any additional funds raised beyond our target will go into enhancements and features that we would like to include such as greater mobile support for local events (alerts, event maps, and video capability) as well as increasing the speed at which we can roll out to new neighborhoods. 
Rewards
“Stay Local” Rewards Swag …
$25 Reward - Sticker
 



$50 Reward - Retro Sunglasses

<p>Thank YOU for your time and attention!</p>
<p>That's my daughter in the picture above, we were both excited about the back to school shopping trip they took last Monday. She came back with school supplies, a backpack, shoes, and some clothing- awesome! We're both so thankful!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It's been two years now- living in shelters, motels, with Beautiful friends. I've spent this time being grateful for the roof, focusing on self-improvement, Loving, learning from, and teaching my daughter, and trying to find a way to provide for her without being neglectful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It wasn't until I saw this news story <span><a href=""http://m.nbcmiami.com/nbcmiami/pm_108209/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=mp2XX9wN"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://m.nbcmiami.com/nbcmiami/pm_108209/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=mp2XX9wN</a></span> that I felt the sting of my childhood homelessness. Seeing my daughters face under the heading sent me into the past. I began to recall the sadness, the feeling of having nowhere to call home and the anxiety from the lack of stability. Being teased on the playground when schoolmates saw ME on a News segment done at the shelter I was in.</p>
<p>It saddened me, to have my child experiencing the same, to be the Mother, who as I child I felt so sorry for. I remembered being 7 years old, packing my little suitcase and writing a runaway note, telling my Mom I wanted to make things easier for her and heading around the corner to hide (of course she found me). I remembered the day my Mother died, while we were living in a transitional shelter, and the devastation that followed.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> It's not for lack of effort that I ended up here. I once accepted a job that required three buses and five hours of commute time to get there. But the pay was decent, great by Miami standards , so I tried anyway. Dragging her out in the streets <a rel=""noopener nofollow"">at 6:00am</a> from one bus stop to the next. The stories of struggle are countless, I'm sure many can relate.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now my time in this shelter is up, any day I could be discharged. Thankfully, I'll be transferred to another shelter since I have a child, and I'm grateful for that.</p>
<p>I'm asking for your hand because this isn't the life she deserves. She's so bright, loving and energetic, and I can slowly see a change in her.</p>

Thank YOU for your time and attention!
That's my daughter in the picture above, we were both excited about the back to school shopping trip they took last Monday. She came back with school supplies, a backpack, shoes, and some clothing- awesome! We're both so thankful!
 
It's been two years now- living in shelters, motels, with Beautiful friends. I've spent this time being grateful for the roof, focusing on self-improvement, Loving, learning from, and teaching my daughter, and trying to find a way to provide for her without being neglectful.
 
It wasn't until I saw this news story http://m.nbcmiami.com/nbcmiami/pm_108209/contentdetail.htm?contentguid=mp2XX9wN that I felt the sting of my childhood homelessness. Seeing my daughters face under the heading sent me into the past. I began to recall the sadness, the feeling of having nowhere to call home and the anxiety from the lack of stability. Being teased on the playground when schoolmates saw ME on a News segment done at the shelter I was in.
It saddened me, to have my child experiencing the same, to be the Mother, who as I child I felt so sorry for. I remembered being 7 years old, packing my little suitcase and writing a runaway note, telling my Mom I wanted to make things easier for her and heading around the corner to hide (of course she found me). I remembered the day my Mother died, while we were living in a transitional shelter, and the devastation that followed.
 
 It's not for lack of effort that I ended up here. I once accepted a job that required three buses and five hours of commute time to get there. But the pay was decent, great by Miami standards , so I tried anyway. Dragging her out in the streets at 6:00am from one bus stop to the next. The stories of struggle are countless, I'm sure many can relate.
 
Now my time in this shelter is up, any day I could be discharged. Thankfully, I'll be transferred to another shelter since I have a child, and I'm grateful for that.
I'm asking for your hand because this isn't the life she deserves. She's so bright, loving and energetic, and I can slowly see a change in her.
She was recently able to get  into preschool, but I have yet to find a job, 
I'm not hopeless, I know things will workout. 
 
I'm asking for your help to get a jump start, in providing Babesters with a more stable life. It would relieve the pressure of move-in costs once I find a job, I'd really Love to pay a years rent, it would make it easier to get a place since I have an eviction on my record, and most will be reluctant to rent to me, many won't at all.
 
They say it takes a village to raise a child, with that thought I put pride to the side to ask for help.
Please spread the word, ask your co-workers, friends, family etc.
 
I appreciate YOU, much Love to you and yours!

</p><div> <p>I need your help.  My name is Richard and was doing okay until I lost my job on 
4/11/14. My background has been in manufacturing for more than 26 years. 
That is what happens when you get old, they just 
throw you out like garbage!
</p>
<p>So in 2010, I took up competitive shooting in the long range f-class on a 
local level, joined a couple of private gun ranges, one of which has a 
1000 yard range. Then on a state level as I continued improve my stats &amp; climb the 
ladder. See we are ranked by the NRA by a percentage of others around 
the country with similar scores, Marksman being the lowest, Sharpshooter
 next up, Expert in the middle, Master and High Master being the top of 
your class.  I have excelled and currently am ranked as ""High Master"" in the mid range (300 &amp;600 
yards) and ""Expert"" at 1000 yards, and still working on my ""High Master"" degree in this
 class.  I currently hold range record @ 300 yards of 600-50 X match 
winner. My goal is to hold some national records as well.</p>
<p>Without your help, I will not be able to go and compete this year if i don't get your help in funding.  Please help as this is very important to me and my goal of becoming a great marksman.  With your help, I will be able to attend this year as this will be my 3rd nationals.
</p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need roughly $4,000.00.  I know, it sounds like a lot, but the National's competition is over a week long which includes many financial requirements, some of which are:</p>
<p>$1600 for hotels during the trip to and from for 16 days
</p>
<p>$800 for food during the 16 day trip</p>
<p>$260 entry fee</p>
<p>$600 for fuel to and from
</p>
<p>$360 - a 9% fee that will be charged 380 just in case of tire blow out or road side assistance <br/>I
 can not thank you guys enough for giving me this opportunity.  Reaching this goal and attending the National's championship tournament means 
the world to me!!!  Even if i don't reach my goal, the funds will still 
be used to get to nationals, even if i have to bum a ride and bunk up 
with someone.<br/></p>
<h3>The Perks <br/>
</h3>
<h3>When I am on my way to and from and at the match, I will send back 
pics of the match and daily scores of how I am doing in my class and 
over all.<br/>
</h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>By contributing to any shooter, you 
continue to grow and bring awareness to this important sport, which has seen record level's of interest over the last 
several years.  They have capped this match at 320 participates.  I need your support to make this happen.  If I don't get to go I will be heartbroken.<br/><br/><br/><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>The
 wind will be the biggest factor in how well everyone does or does not 
do.  See, some of us (meaning me) shoot better in windy conditions as we 
have wind at our range every match since we are so close to the coastline.  I 
also shoot better in a boil (that is when the wind is not blowing).  The
 target actually moves up  and dances around because of the Marge (heat 
waves). That is a very tricky way to shoot, but i have mastered it.</div><div>
<br/><div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p> <ul>
<li>Ask folks to get the word out.</li>

<p><b>What
We’re All About</b></p>
<p>DoYouRemember is the digital destination for people who love nostalgia.
Whether it’s old TV and movies, classic rock, vintage clothing or sports
memorabilia, you can find original, compelling content on DoYouRemember.com. </p>
<p>The company was founded by Michael Gitter, who wrote the best-selling
series of coffee table nostalgia books, <i>Do
You Remember? </i>in the 1990s. He’s also a 15-year advertising industry
veteran. He’s supported by a team of experienced editors, writers, graphic
artists and programmers. </p>
<p>We launched the site about nine months ago, and already it has a large,
rapidly growing audience of millions of fans that love all things retro.</p>
<p><b>What
We Need</b></p>
<p>We’ve been asked many times by people how they can get involved. Now you
can, as we continue to grow our business by introducing compelling new features
and develop foreign language versions of the site. With your help, we can build
the only true community of people who are eager to indulge their passion for
nostalgia. In a world gone mad, our fond memories help keep us
grounded and connect with humanity. We’re raising $250,000 to help us
continue to delight and entertain our loyal fan base.</p>
<p><b>What’s
In It For You</b></p>
<p>When you participate in this campaign, we’ll show our appreciation by
sending you a DYR hat or T-shirt; larger contributors will choose from
advertising and promotional opportunities, including Tweets to our 300,000
Twitter followers, Facebook posts for the millions of people who follow us
there, and editorial coverage on our site’s homepage.</p>
<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>Unlike other campaigns you may have seen, we’re up and running—fast! And
based upon a recent poll we conducted, we’re doing lots of things right, as our
users tell us they love following us. </p>
<p>We’re experiencing double-digit traffic growth nearly every month, and
we’re adding 2,500 Twitter followers a day! Soon, we’ll be carrying advertising
on the site, as we begin to monetize this great platform.</p>
<p><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Having already launched and having been successful in drawing a large
audience, we’ve already proved our concept, eliminating a huge potential risk. Our
challenge is to continue growing our fan base by providing features that
inspire people to visit our site frequently, and tell their friends about it.</p>
<p>There’s no other site like DoYouRemember.com, and therefore, there’s no
direct competition. There are many great sites, fan clubs, blogs and Facebook
pages devoted to great old movies, musical idols and TV personalities from the
past, but there’s no place that addresses all of these interests in one
location. </p>
<p>We have advantages over any new player in the space as we’ve spent
several years working on our product and marketing it; as such, we have a great
competitive advantage. </p>
<p><b>Other
Ways You Can Do</b></p>
<p>We’ve grown our following by people discovering our site, and telling
their friends and family about it. We’d greatly appreciate you to tell others
you know who love all things retro about DoYouRemember and our IndieGoGo
campaign.</p>

DoYouRemember is the digital destination for people who love nostalgia.
Whether it’s old TV and movies, classic rock, vintage clothing or sports
memorabilia, you can find original, compelling content on DoYouRemember.com. 
The company was founded by Michael Gitter, who wrote the best-selling
series of coffee table nostalgia books, Do
You Remember? in the 1990s. He’s also a 15-year advertising industry
veteran. He’s supported by a team of experienced editors, writers, graphic
artists and programmers. 
We launched the site about nine months ago, and already it has a large,
rapidly growing audience of millions of fans that love all things retro.
What
We Need
We’ve been asked many times by people how they can get involved. Now you
can, as we continue to grow our business by introducing compelling new features
and develop foreign language versions of the site. With your help, we can build
the only true community of people who are eager to indulge their passion for
nostalgia. In a world gone mad, our fond memories help keep us
grounded and connect with humanity. We’re raising $250,000 to help us
continue to delight and entertain our loyal fan base.
What’s
In It For You
When you participate in this campaign, we’ll show our appreciation by
sending you a DYR hat or T-shirt; larger contributors will choose from
advertising and promotional opportunities, including Tweets to our 300,000
Twitter followers, Facebook posts for the millions of people who follow us
there, and editorial coverage on our site’s homepage.
The
Impact
Unlike other campaigns you may have seen, we’re up and running—fast! And
based upon a recent poll we conducted, we’re doing lots of things right, as our
users tell us they love following us. 
We’re experiencing double-digit traffic growth nearly every month, and
we’re adding 2,500 Twitter followers a day! Soon, we’ll be carrying advertising
on the site, as we begin to monetize this great platform.
Risks
& Challenges
Having already launched and having been successful in drawing a large
audience, we’ve already proved our concept, eliminating a huge potential risk. Our
challenge is to continue growing our fan base by providing features that
inspire people to visit our site frequently, and tell their friends about it.
There’s no other site like DoYouRemember.com, and therefore, there’s no
direct competition. There are many great sites, fan clubs, blogs and Facebook
pages devoted to great old movies, musical idols and TV personalities from the
past, but there’s no place that addresses all of these interests in one
location. 
We have advantages over any new player in the space as we’ve spent
several years working on our product and marketing it; as such, we have a great
competitive advantage. 
Other
Ways You Can Do
We’ve grown our following by people discovering our site, and telling
their friends and family about it. We’d greatly appreciate you to tell others
you know who love all things retro about DoYouRemember and our IndieGoGo
campaign.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

We are passionate about Africans, we want to create a platform where they can be seen as they really are: creative, resilient, entrepreneurial, artistic and innovative. We have this BIG BOLD vision to showcase the people, music, fashion, culture, media, technology and businesses from the continent and globally, in a bi monthly interactive digital magazine, ReAfrica. 


What is ReAfrica?
ReAfrica puts all the content that you would usually see in a lifestyle magazine into an engaging, visual multimedia experience.  

The magazine will portray the sounds and images of Africans through video, audio and animation. Each edition will have interviews, the art scene, culture, music, film, businesses,fashion and even feature a particular city in Africa so you can discover the best places to visit, things to do and meet the people.


The first edition will feature Kampala, Uganda

 

Angela is a budding fashion designer in Kampala. Discover the nightlife, the Boda Bodas, the budding community of animators, authentic food, and much more the city has to offer.


We need you to help us achieve this HUGE dream. Africa is large with a lot of people and a lot of stories. We want you to partner with us to tell them.  

This is what the reader will get from ReAfrica magazine


6 Issues a year


80+ pages of  well researched stories, high resolution photography, high definition videos, an African city feature, celebrity profiles, informative 'How To' sections, Interviews, Events, and 


A themed issue including: The Entrepreneur Issue, The Money Issue, The New Media Issue, The Music Issue, The Fashion Issue


A Multimedia Experience



ReAfrica will bring you all the great things Africans are doing in the diaspora, from those threading the board in London's West End, making independent film in Hollywood. The first feature interview will be of two Nigerian sisters making building an artisanal skin care brand in New York. 





Your bit

We want to publish a digital magazine that will give the reader an indelible, unforgettable experience.  Creating an interactive digital magazine can be expensive especially the first edition,  so we have broken down the costs for the edition below 




Our biggest expense is publishing the magazine which includes all the research and design that goes into creating a sustainable design, that is going to set our magazine apart from other independent magazines similar in the app store. Our team of creatives are really passionate, working tirelessly and are only being paid their expenses. The other costs involved are the cost of creating and collating content locally and internationally, design and layout, app development and campaign costs.

As world-altering technologies continue to develop, the reality we experience as individuals changes faster than our social systems can react, pushing them to their limit.

A world built on transparency and ethical networks that serve the greater good. A world that celebrates our differences while subscribing to the simple truth that We Are One.</p>

</div></div>","Spectral Alchemy, creators of DMT: The Spirit Molecule, presents - MYTHAPHI (pronounced mith-uh-fai) - an innovative experience from director Mitch Schultz. Welcome to the multi-dimensional storyworld and transmedia platform that aims to recode human mythology.
MYTHAPHI is four-part narrative framework, expansive online experience, and evolutionary media platform that collects and curates concepts from the leading edge of human experience, bringing visionaries together from around the world to hack culture and reality; explore human potential; and inspire positive change.
ALL the media produced for The Spirit Molecule, AND the ENTIRE Spectral Alchemy media archive, will be fully available to stream or download for the MYTHAPHI community. Through an open source and transmedia approach to the storytelling process, we can co-create the first-ever integrated media studio for the global community.
MYTHAPHI seeks to actively engage the world so that we may collectively rediscover who we are, and re-imagine who we might become. Join us to redefine culture, reframe mythology, and redirect our purpose as a species.
Platform Features:

Media arts production & distribution; original, curated, and community content
Cloud hosted open source media library: audio/music, video, FX, photos, etc
Online RMXLab with authoring tool to create transmedia experiences 
Mesh economy/marketplace with ethical income opportunities for members
Community hub with social media and collaboration functions 
Active forum with exclusive access to various change makers 

Design Philosophy:

Rediscover the art of celebrating life in all its forms
Co-create a new mythology that guides an integrative planetary culture
Discover the latest news and information on leading edge culture and emerging technology published by expert curators from various disciplines 
Foster the emergence of innovative ways of thinking and socially conscious media - movies, music, e-books, art, apps and more
Link with like-minded efforts to create an active network of networks
Encourage a reconnection with nature and sustainable living practices
Host a global community dialogue on human culture, recoding mythology
Support the development of clean technologies designed for positive impact

MYTHAPHI’s users and curators create, connect, and trade with individuals who share a common purpose: explore paradox and support human evolution.








We live in a time of rapidly increasing complexity. As world-altering technologies continue to develop, the reality we experience as individuals changes faster than our social systems can react, pushing them to their limit. Because of this tension between aging social constructs and humankind’s newfound and ever-evolving connectivity, it may seem as if our world is fracturing — even going backwards in some ways.
But nothing could be farther from truth. As a species we are entering a new era; a time when we can actively cultivate the ground we all share, rather than focusing on the differences that divide us.
We firmly believe that humanity goes where we put our focus, essentially creating our own reality. So MYTHAPHI’s content will be thoughtfully produced and carefully selected to help create an entirely new story that reflects the world we wish to live in. A world that inspires and connects. A world built on transparency and ethical networks that serve the greater good. A world that celebrates our differences while subscribing to the simple truth that We Are One.
The path forward is uncharted and unknown. Through MYTHAPHI, we hope to walk that path together as an informed and engaged community dedicated to tangible change in our world.

FOUR CHANNELS, LIMITLESS POSSIBILITY


MYTHAPHI is comprised of four main channels, each focusing on a key area of exploration: MIND, ECO, MUSE and EPOCH. These channels will host a collection of hand-picked, expert curators — artists, musicians, philosophers, scientists, storytellers — all of whom operate at the very edge of emerging culture and technology. 







MIND: Science, Spirit, Logos
Question the past, present and future of consciousness and our interpretation of awareness by uncovering the similarities between traditionally opposing modes of knowing.
ECO: Animal, Mineral, Plant 
Explore the infinitely complex symbiosis between all things living and inert, and learn how we can rediscover a respectful relationship with our planet.
MUSE: Motion, Music, Still  
Embrace the forces that move us to be makers: through art, music, video, fashion, performance — any creative expression celebrating the human spirit.
EPOCH: Act, Ethos, Conduit
Consider how MIND, ECO and MUSE come together to create a new human narrative — a story of the times in which we live, and the future we envision for ourselves.


THE PROCESS HAS BEGUN, SUPPORT ITS GROWTH




With the successful completion of our IndieGoGo campaign, MYTHAPHI will accelerate the production and delivery of four feature length iDocs (interactive documentaries), each focusing on sparking dialogue across all MYTHAPHI channels: MIND, ECO, MUSE and EPOCH. As mentioned above, ALL the media produced for these unique projects will be fully available to the community for education, remixing, and sharing.

<b> Eat Naked</b>: Organic, Clean, and Stripped Eating for a Better, Spicier You. Weather you're vegetarian or omnivore, raw or cooked, macrobiotic, or traditional—eating naked will boost the health benefits, and help you look great, even without your clothes on!

Eating naked is the philosophy of the <b>Naked Chef, Jacques Laventure</b>, from <b>MTV's Snack Off</b> and the <b>14 Minutes Snacks Cook Book</b>. Here are a few of his Naked tips that he'll be discussing during the<b> Cooking Demo</b>:

Eating naked is the philosophy of the Naked Chef, Jacques Laventure, from MTV's Snack Off and the 14 Minutes Snacks Cook Book. Here are a few of his Naked tips that he'll be discussing during the Cooking Demo:

<p>The General Store Seattle is specifically designed to be a distributor for a wide variety of products that fulfill the daily needs of our locavore communities. While locavorism itself is usually confined to food and beverage products, The General Store Seattle aims to broaden this “farm to table” mindset to include your everyday item needs as well.</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide goods that only come from local, regional, and national suppliers to help Seattleites and those in the surrounding areas live more thoughtful, healthy, and happy lives. By giving customers an efficient way to put their money where their values are, we hope to make thoughtful purchasing decisions as easy as possible.</p>
<p>All of our products, ranging from food, to household, to body products, to clothing and accessories, to entertainment, are hand-picked by us and come from the Pacific Northwest and the United States. Over time, this will improve not only our economy but also our self-sufficiency as a region.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span>Retail sales will generate the company’s profit and we are projected to make $35,788 net profit within the first year. At present, just under $50,000 start up capital is needed to launch the business. This encompasses the initial purchase of inventory for the store as well as a year of operating costs. These operating costs include rent, salaries, marketing, maintenance, sales tax, and necessary equipment. </span></p>
<p>Our first brick and mortar hub is located in the up-and-coming neighborhood of West Seattle. Inventory will be sold both in person and <a href=""www.thegeneralstoreseattle.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">online</a> so that customers who wish to put their hard-earned money directly back into their communities can shop in our store, pick up online orders, or receive bike or mail carrier delivery. The store will move to a larger location chosen for its proximity to shopping centers and foot traffic once a solid customer base and revenue flow has been established.</p>
<p>The General Store Seattle, LLC is an Limited Liability Company founded by Claire Jones in 2014 and owned by herself, Mark Jones, and Morgan Dolan. Claire will manage and operate the store. Claire’s retail experience is extensive - she has worked in retail for eight years in a variety of positions. Her mother was a public school teacher and her father worked redeveloping inner city neighborhoods and assisting small businesses. As such, she was raised to believe in creating opportunities within our communities. As the locavore movement grows, we hope to establish additional locations across the US.</p>
<p><span>To cover a portion of our start-up costs, we created this Indiegogo fund to generate numerous small donations. We are maximizing our online reach by promoting this fund via our website and social media sites as well as an email newsletter campaign. To thank our contributors, we will be offering a selection of one-time thank-you gifts based on donation amounts.</span></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>The financial analysis for The General Store Seattle, LLC was based on a variety of factors. Overall, we both over-estimated on costs and under-estimated on profit to provide us with a sizable “buffer zone” to prepare for the unexpected. That said, we calculated our costs using industry averages as well as the expected costs of an average rented retail space in and around West Seattle. We calculated our revenue using industry averages, the averages of our competitors, and averages based on retail square footage.</span></p>
<p>The yearly net costs projection brings us to just under $50,000 which was calculated by subtracting the estimated yearly expenses and inventory purchases from the estimated sales projections. Expenses include rent, deposits, registrations, advertising, maintenance, salaries, inventory, insurance, and necessary equipment and software.</p>The revenue projections, averaged between four possible retail spaces, are estimated to be around $129,500 for the first year. We were conservative in our revenue projections and graduated our sales with $3,500 for the first month of operation, $6,000 for the second month, and $12,000 per month beyond that. This does not include online sales.</div><div>
<p><span>We need just under $50,000 of start up capital to cover the net costs in our first year of operation. Claire Jones has pledged $5,000, Mark Jones has pledged $10,000, and Morgan Dolan has pledged $7,125 so far. These will be paid over time for a total of $22,125. If subtracted from the $50,000 start-up amount, that brings us to $27,875 still needed.</span><br/></p>

</div> <div> <h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Overall Impact</h3> <p></p>
<span>The future of our industry looks extremely bright as part of the worldwide movement toward community-based living. These mindsets are returning to the forefront and movements like locavorism, vegetarianism, organic farming and production, and the push against climate change and pollution are gradually reshaping the economics of agriculture and commercial industries thus spurring a revival of small farms and businesses.</span>
</div><div><span><span>Under the current global system, 73 cents of every dollar spent on food goes to production, distribution and advertisement. The farmer only pockets seven cents. This reflects a dire need to build a system closer to our American roots and values.</span><br/></span></div><div>
<span><span><p><span>Local products, on the other hand, are more sustainable, healthier, better for the environment, and more economically positive than products sourced from large-scale, globalized production systems.

</div> <p><span><b>We are asking you to please help make our dream a reality, <span>so let’s join forces and get to work!</span></b></span><br/></p></div>","Executive Summary 
The General Store Seattle is specifically designed to be a distributor for a wide variety of products that fulfill the daily needs of our locavore communities. While locavorism itself is usually confined to food and beverage products, The General Store Seattle aims to broaden this “farm to table” mindset to include your everyday item needs as well.
Our goal is to provide goods that only come from local, regional, and national suppliers to help Seattleites and those in the surrounding areas live more thoughtful, healthy, and happy lives. By giving customers an efficient way to put their money where their values are, we hope to make thoughtful purchasing decisions as easy as possible.
All of our products, ranging from food, to household, to body products, to clothing and accessories, to entertainment, are hand-picked by us and come from the Pacific Northwest and the United States. Over time, this will improve not only our economy but also our self-sufficiency as a region.

Retail sales will generate the company’s profit and we are projected to make $35,788 net profit within the first year. At present, just under $50,000 start up capital is needed to launch the business. This encompasses the initial purchase of inventory for the store as well as a year of operating costs. These operating costs include rent, salaries, marketing, maintenance, sales tax, and necessary equipment. 
Our first brick and mortar hub is located in the up-and-coming neighborhood of West Seattle. Inventory will be sold both in person and online so that customers who wish to put their hard-earned money directly back into their communities can shop in our store, pick up online orders, or receive bike or mail carrier delivery. The store will move to a larger location chosen for its proximity to shopping centers and foot traffic once a solid customer base and revenue flow has been established.
The General Store Seattle, LLC is an Limited Liability Company founded by Claire Jones in 2014 and owned by herself, Mark Jones, and Morgan Dolan. Claire will manage and operate the store. Claire’s retail experience is extensive - she has worked in retail for eight years in a variety of positions. Her mother was a public school teacher and her father worked redeveloping inner city neighborhoods and assisting small businesses. As such, she was raised to believe in creating opportunities within our communities. As the locavore movement grows, we hope to establish additional locations across the US.
To cover a portion of our start-up costs, we created this Indiegogo fund to generate numerous small donations. We are maximizing our online reach by promoting this fund via our website and social media sites as well as an email newsletter campaign. To thank our contributors, we will be offering a selection of one-time thank-you gifts based on donation amounts.
   What We Need & What You Get 
The financial analysis for The General Store Seattle, LLC was based on a variety of factors. Overall, we both over-estimated on costs and under-estimated on profit to provide us with a sizable “buffer zone” to prepare for the unexpected. That said, we calculated our costs using industry averages as well as the expected costs of an average rented retail space in and around West Seattle. We calculated our revenue using industry averages, the averages of our competitors, and averages based on retail square footage.
The yearly net costs projection brings us to just under $50,000 which was calculated by subtracting the estimated yearly expenses and inventory purchases from the estimated sales projections. Expenses include rent, deposits, registrations, advertising, maintenance, salaries, inventory, insurance, and necessary equipment and software.The revenue projections, averaged between four possible retail spaces, are estimated to be around $129,500 for the first year. We were conservative in our revenue projections and graduated our sales with $3,500 for the first month of operation, $6,000 for the second month, and $12,000 per month beyond that. This does not include online sales.
We need just under $50,000 of start up capital to cover the net costs in our first year of operation. Claire Jones has pledged $5,000, Mark Jones has pledged $10,000, and Morgan Dolan has pledged $7,125 so far. These will be paid over time for a total of $22,125. If subtracted from the $50,000 start-up amount, that brings us to $27,875 still needed.

  The Overall Impact 
The future of our industry looks extremely bright as part of the worldwide movement toward community-based living. These mindsets are returning to the forefront and movements like locavorism, vegetarianism, organic farming and production, and the push against climate change and pollution are gradually reshaping the economics of agriculture and commercial industries thus spurring a revival of small farms and businesses.
Under the current global system, 73 cents of every dollar spent on food goes to production, distribution and advertisement. The farmer only pockets seven cents. This reflects a dire need to build a system closer to our American roots and values.
Local products, on the other hand, are more sustainable, healthier, better for the environment, and more economically positive than products sourced from large-scale, globalized production systems. A national study conducted by the Food Marketing Institute in 2009 uncovered the top three reasons consumers already buy local:• 82% – freshness of the products• 75% – support for the local economy• 58% – knowing the source of the product
The locavore movement is growing, and the opportunities for entrepreneurs are ripe. Based on research conducted by the USDA Economic Research Service, the movement was estimated to have generated $4.8 billion in sales in 2008, and it was projected that locally grown foods generated nearly $7 billion in sales in 2012. Not only is it a sound lifestyle choice, but it is a sound business choice as well.
In Seattle specifically, King County farmers’ markets are pulling in an estimated $30 million annually. Small farms are popping up everywhere in the region, ringing up annual sales ranging from $10,000 to more than $1 million. The Pacific Northwest area is particularly ripe for an ethically-minded business like ours because it serves as the fertile crescent of the United States.

</ul><p></p><p>Thanks!  Let's get the ball rolling!</p></div>","Short Summary (note some recent changes*)The pool on HMCC grounds has been in use for over 60 years.  The Town of Hantsport has been operating the pool for nearly a decade, and have recently decided not to open it for the summer of 2014.  For the first time in its history, the pool would be closed. But........'Save our Pool', a group of citizens and friends of the Hantsport Pool formed as a response to Hantsport Town Council's decision that they could not afford to operate the pool.HMCC was approached and asked if they would operate the pool if enough money could be raised.  The HMCC board of directors met, and passed a motion to operate the pool, conditional upon monies being raised and insurance, staff and preparation of the pool being taken care of.   Nearly 100 people came out on short notice to a barbecue to support our efforts to raise money so that Hantsport Memorial Community Center could operate the pool.  Many have pledged their intentions to buy Family Passes to the pool for the summer.  So..........What We Need & What You GetThe Town estimates that the pool cost just under $25,000 to operate last year.  Options exist (such as: reduced hours, different staffing models, etc.), that could allow the pool to open and operate with less money, but our goal will be to raise enough to fully operate the pool for the summer.We have set a modest goal for this online campaign ($2,500 in 45 days).  *If you have already pledged to purchase a Family Pass (at our barbecue), thank you.  You will receive a phone call with more information.  You can also contribute here, note the perks added to the right of this page. (you can also email: hantsportpool@gmail.com for more information). If we do not raise enough money to open the pool, *any passes purchased will be refunded at the buyer's request*.  All donations will be put toward an effort to open the pool next summer (2015).  In the event that the pool proves to be impossible to open, even next year, all monies will be donated to youth recreation at HMCC.The ImpactYour contributions will help!  Every dollar we raise gets us closer to our goal of opening the pool and providing this facility to our community and everyone who comes to visit.Please help us reach (and, hopefully, exceed!) our goal of raising $2,500 through this campaign.  Everything raised here will be added to our other efforts and put toward Hantsport's Pool.Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can't contribute money, but that doesn't mean they can't help! 
Help us get the word out and make some noise about our campaign.
We may need some help (labour, etc.) to get the pool ready before opening.
If you know a company that might want to help, send them our way!  We are developing a signage campaign also, that would allow supportive companies to advertise around the pool.  (email: hantsportpool@gmail.com for more information).

</ul>We've already had more than 100 contributors—neighbors, friends, colleagues, and anonymous patrons—and passed all of our expectations, so I'm not sure what we dare to expect, so I'm not going to state any specifics. We still have several perks available (including Open Book mugs, free books, or Lynn at your dinner party), and we've added new perks (for instance, lifetime discounts) as incentives, <p></p>

<p>That’s
why, following up on our long careers in the book publishing industry,<b> we’re opening a
bookstore in our town. <br/></b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>The independent bookstore is <b><a href=""http://www.bookweb.org/news/45-aba-member-stores-open-2013"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">making a comeback</a>.</b> </p>
<p>There are <b><a href=""http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/bookselling/article/62573-bea-2014-bricks-and-mortar-rebounding.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">more than 2,000 </a></b>independent bookstores in the U.S. for the first time since 2005. And indie bookstores play a very important role in their communities. </p>
<p>According to the <a href=""http://www.indiebound.org/indiebound-faq"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">American
Booksellers Association</a>:</p>
<a href=""http://www.indiebound.org/indiebound-faq"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><p></p>
<p></p> <ul> <li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>Spend $100 at a local bookstore </b>and <b>$68 of that stays in your
community.</b> Spend the same $100 at a national chain, and your community only
sees $43.</span>

<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">More independents means <b>more choice, more diversity,</b> and <b>a truly
unique community</b>.<br/><br/></span></li> </ul> <p></p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Why Us: What We’ve Already Accomplished </h3>
<p>Books have always been our shared passion, and throughout <b>our various jobs in publishing</b>, our mission has been to help get books into the hands of readers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lynn has been an editor, literary agent, bookstore event manager, professor of English and graduate publishing, and an author.</li>
<li>Evan has been a book marketer, ghostwriter, copywriter and a proofreader, and managed a bookstore.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the last several years, Lynn has been running Open Book, a popular program of <b><a href=""http://lynnrosen.com/events-calendar/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">author events</a></b> and <b><a href=""http://lynnrosen.com/hot-off-the-press-fall-2014/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">book discussion classes</a></b>. </p>
<p>Two years ago, we opened a wholesale account with a distributor so Lynn’s students and class attendees could buy their books from her. </p>
<p>Last year, we <b>added a “pop up” mobile bookstore</b>, which appeared periodically at the local co-op, preschool, and elsewhere.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Now we’re about to embark on a new project that is the culmination of all we’ve loved, learned and done: <b>making Open Book a real bricks-and-mortar bookstore!</b></p>
<p>Our little bookstore will be a place where people gather, not only to <b>find good books</b>, but to <b>talk about them </b>with <b>others who care about books</b>; where people can attend<b> author readings</b>, <b>book discussion classes</b>, after-school <b>story hours</b> and more. </p>
<p>We will put our expertise and experience in the publishing industry to work, along with our skills choosing and recommending books. </p>
<p>We'll sublet a few hundred square feet <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span>in town for a small, highly-curated collection focused on <b>literary and classic fiction</b> and nonfiction, <b>young adult &amp; children’s books</b>, and a range of books by <b>local authors in the Greater Philadelphia area.</b><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></b></p>

<li>Implement a<b> point-of-sale system</b> that includes printing receipts, a cash drawer and perhaps a barcode scanner</li>

We're grateful — no, floored!  by your support: more than 75% above our  goal. Thank you, thank you, Indiegogo community. If you're ever in the Philadelphia suburbs, please stop by the store to check out our selection and for us to thank you in person:
Open Book Bookstore7900 High School RdElkins Park, PA 19027


UPDATE: 1-18-2015

We're so grateful! We not only surpassed our initial goal, but now we've passed our stretch goal! The ""Open"" sign is on the door, the ""Grand Opening"" banner is in the window, and new bookshelves are set up. Books are on shelves, orders are placed with distributors and publishers, and we've picked up QuickBooks (which we guess we need to learn to use now). Thank you to all of you who have contributed to our campaign, ordered books or gift certificates, and shared the news that ""there's a new bookstore in town!""
All that said, we're going to push our luck, and ask for you to keep those contributions coming. Per our previously stated stretch goals, we will split additional funds we collect as follows:


Inventory: 70% 
Furnishing/Fixtures: 15% 
Working Capital: 15% for marketing, advertising & events
We've already had more than 100 contributors—neighbors, friends, colleagues, and anonymous patrons—and passed all of our expectations, so I'm not sure what we dare to expect, so I'm not going to state any specifics. We still have several perks available (including Open Book mugs, free books, or Lynn at your dinner party), and we've added new perks (for instance, lifetime discounts) as incentives, 
How far can you dare to go? You decide!





UPDATE: 1-13-2015 There's no turning back! We're in the final stretch! Our Indiegogo campaign is starting its final week, our bookshelves, window, and display table are filling with books, and we're preparing for our official Grand Opening. Tomorrow, I'm heading out to purchase some little banners like these:



UPDATE: 1-2-2015


It’s unbelievable! We are thrilled and grateful for the support we have received so far from our friends, colleagues, and community for our new Open Book Bookstore. Only 12 days into the campaign and we already achieved our initial goal. 
But we’re not going to stop! Now that our campaign reached its first milestone, we’re adding another. That’s right, we’re continuing our campaign and adding a stretch goal of $8,000. With your continued help we can do more than we initially imagined!

Your CONTINUED contributions to the Open Book Bookstore will help as follows:


Inventory Expansion: 50% of additional funds raised will be committed to adding more non-fiction, young adult/teen, and classic titles, and to add to the fiction and children’s books sections we’ve been developing.


Also, we’ve had requests to add a poetry section and some art books.

Furnishing & Fixtures: 30% will go towards things like
More shelving units to hold book inventory. 
A cashwrap/checkout station with a locked cash drawer.

We have our eye on some small “vintage” (read “old”) pieces of furniture for our window display (to go along with the vintage Smith & Corona typewriter we put there already).








Working Capital: 20% will be set aside, allocated to ongoing need for marketing & advertising and author events:
Designing and printing flyers for store events;
Running occasional ads in local publications;
Better signage for the store exterior;
Printing bookmarks and other branded store items such as mailing labels;
Event funds: for refreshments and author travel-related expenses. 



INITIAL POST 12-19-2014
We want to bring a much-needed bookstore to the Philly suburbs.


Why We Are Here

More and more people these days care about supporting local businesses and eating locally-grown
food. There’s something else we believe in and support. We like to say: Read Local.

That’s
why, following up on our long careers in the book publishing industry, we’re opening a
bookstore in our town. 

The independent bookstore is making a comeback. 
There are more than 2,000 independent bookstores in the U.S. for the first time since 2005. And indie bookstores play a very important role in their communities. 
According to the American
Booksellers Association:

  
Spend $100 at a local bookstore and $68 of that stays in your
community. Spend the same $100 at a national chain, and your community only
sees $43.

More independents means more choice, more diversity, and a truly
unique community.  

Why Us: What We’ve Already Accomplished 
Books have always been our shared passion, and throughout our various jobs in publishing, our mission has been to help get books into the hands of readers:

Lynn has been an editor, literary agent, bookstore event manager, professor of English and graduate publishing, and an author.
Evan has been a book marketer, ghostwriter, copywriter and a proofreader, and managed a bookstore.

For the last several years, Lynn has been running Open Book, a popular program of author events and book discussion classes. 
Two years ago, we opened a wholesale account with a distributor so Lynn’s students and class attendees could buy their books from her. 
Last year, we added a “pop up” mobile bookstore, which appeared periodically at the local co-op, preschool, and elsewhere.


What's Next: What We Need & What You Get


Now we’re about to embark on a new project that is the culmination of all we’ve loved, learned and done: making Open Book a real bricks-and-mortar bookstore!
Our little bookstore will be a place where people gather, not only to find good books, but to talk about them with others who care about books; where people can attend author readings, book discussion classes, after-school story hours and more. 
We will put our expertise and experience in the publishing industry to work, along with our skills choosing and recommending books. 
We'll sublet a few hundred square feet in town for a small, highly-curated collection focused on literary and classic fiction and nonfiction, young adult & children’s books, and a range of books by local authors in the Greater Philadelphia area.

We're looking for $5,000 in funding to help us during the important first few months to
Build up our inventory

Purchase additional shelving

Implement a point-of-sale system that includes printing receipts, a cash drawer and perhaps a barcode scanner
Join the regional and national bookselling associations and local business merchant group, securing our role in the community

Promote and advertise the store in the region
Setup an effective online presence


Help us out and you could also get some nifty bookmarks, a stylish tote bag, a year's worth of personal book recommendations, signed books, or even a dinner party with an author!

Libros a Lobitos is a project with big dreams and realistic goals. It was founded by passionate educators who, after a year of teaching in the local school, realized that English education (while important) was blatantly a secondary concern when compared to more basic educational needs.

A community-wide survey that revealed whisperings of illiteracy in Lobitos’ older generations contributed to the inspiration to establish a program that would not only promote literacy but also ignite a love of literature and aid in fostering a generation of young readers.


We have a simple and straightforward goal: get books into kids’ hands. We aim to create a space that promotes and strengthens a love for reading in Lobitos’ youth and helps create positive memories associated with education, from a young age. Biblioteca Lobitos (the Lobitos Library) is a place where children of all ages can come to nurture their creativity, play, learn and explore.





As the project grows, we are eternally grateful for all of the wonderful people who have seen value in what we are doing and want to be a part of it. The children of Lobitos have left an undeniable mark on many who have been fortunate enough to pass through this special place. Thank you for joining us in our mission to do right by these kids and provide them access to all of the resources that they need and deserve.


  Positive Impact:




“Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world” 
- Nelson Mandela

2013 data collection by UNESCO Institute for Statistics identified Peru as having one of the lowest literacy rates in Latin America with over 12% of the adult population unable to read or write.  Despite economic growth in recent years, there has been little investment in the social services sector.  It is estimated that 40% of Peruvians live below the poverty threshold with 14% living on less than one US dollar a day.

In Lobitos, the disparity is particularly visible. In recent years, there has been tremendous growth and as a result of the surf and oil industries.  Unfortunately, economic barriers have largely hindered local people's ability to invest in establishing businesses that allow them to reap the benefits of this development.  As Lobitos changes, the wealth gap in this small community continues to widen.  Libros A Lobitos is one of few educational initiatives working to close that gap by making educational opportunities and resources accessible to all.
Library funding needs and our recognition to you
 There are many things that we need for this project, but we are firstly focusing on establishing a community library and providing educational classes for the children of Lobitos: they are our number one priority.
The project is currently operating ´hand to mouth´, this is neither sustainable nor fair to the children of Lobitos using our facilities. Our project goal is to raise 9850 USD to setup a fully functioning community library and operate it for the entire year of 2015. This amount of money is absolutely necessary  to provide a huge positive impact for hundreds of children in Lobitos. Without your help we cannot guarantee that the library will be open all year.

<p>Hi there, </p>
<p>   I'm Alicia D. Lurye, Organizer of RocCon.  And a life-long pop culture fan.  </p>
<p>  We want to thank all of you for coming to the 4th annual show in September!  It was the best attended yet with wonderful guests.   Thanks to anyone who's come to RocCon in any year since our 1st show in 2011. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">   As of now, we can only afford to put on as good a show as we did for 2014 and we want to do better than that!  That's why we're here on Indigogo. </span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>       As we go forward things have gotten crazy in ""convention land"".  Conventions from all over have us competing for the big ""name stars"" that we can afford on the weekend RocCon is held and the weeks just before and just after. This includes events held in other countries!   Conventions are announcing their guests earlier and earlier so the competition for guests is stronger.  Especially the icons of the comics, film, tv and anime industies.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">   It's simple.  Bringing in the bigger stars for RocCon takes money.  More than we have.   We are also in competition with every convention on the same weekend and on the weekends before and after.  Even conventions not in the U.S.  Many of us want the same stars.</span><br/></p>
<p>   So, we've decided to have a crowd-funding campaign to help us with the large expenses of bringing in the biggest names we can find.   Simply stated, the money will be used to bring in some of the guest stars that have higher price tags.  No, it won't end up being enough to get us a ""Big Bang Theory"" star,  Shatner or Stan Lee, but hopefully get us into that 20K price range that many of the people you want to see command.  And that 20K does not include their first class airfare, hotel, food and some need all that for a companion as well.   You can see, getting stars anywhere is not cheap. </p>
<p>     We hope that you will truly continue to make RocCon ""YOUR"" convention by helping us grow!  Please donate now.  All monies will go to special guest expenses.</p>
<p>In the meantime, here's a stroll down memory lane.....RocCon from the beginning. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">   In 2010, after coming back from San Diego Comic Con, I realized that there was not, as of yet, a large, multi-genre </span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">Comic Con /Pop Culture Show in Western, NY.  There was a all out anime event, a sci fi event, some comic book only shows and a few gaming events, but nothing that melded the genres and brought us all together for a big party like in other cities. </span><br/></p>

<p>  We're forever in debt to JG Hertzler who drove from his home in the Southern Tier in the fog and rain on the day of the first RocCon in 2011 to make TV and radio appearances..   The talented Eileen Stevens from Pokemon who came by train from New York and Lois Gresh, our wonderful Local New York Times Best Selling Author.   1349 fans came to that first one-day RocCon!  We were off!<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">  </span></p>
<p> The next year, JG brought his good
Klingon Friend Robert O'Reilly to the show!  We also were introduced
to the wonderful Tim McCormack from Star Trek The next Generation. 
Tim lives locally and was wonderful enough to hang out and meet you all weekend, do a
panel and even host an art auction!  It was also our first introduction to some anime guy named
Vic Mignogna. (how do you pronounce that?? lol. He's the best)  Our good friend, New
York times best selling author Lois Gresh was back with us too! 
Remember Eric Smith, the voice of  Team Rocket's James?  He was also there for the fun!! 1800 of you came to have fandom fun over our first 3-day event! We can't forget our wonderful comic book guests as well!</p>
<p>   2013 brought us Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Chris Doohan, Vic Mignogna, Erica Schroeder and of course, JG along with a wonderful slew of comic creators and about 2300 Fun Fandom people! </p>
<p></p>
<p>   2014 RocCon was just beyond incredible!  We stepped up our game and moved the show to  a location with more parking, wonderful event rooms and theatres, great dealer's space, elevators and escalators!     YOU responded by showing up in droves from up to 6 hours away!    And once again, you rose the attendance numbers significantly as more and more of you discovered the little con that could. </p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">  Vic Mignogna was back for an unprecedented 3rd RocCon appearance,  Star Trek's Brent Spiner, the incredible voice actor Billy West, the lovely Alaina Huffman, Next Gen's Tim McCormack and Star Wars Bonnie Piesse rounded out our guest list to roars of happiness from our conventioneers!  The first-ever RocCon Food Truck rodeo kept hunger pangs at bay all weekend!</span></p>
<p>      <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">          We've already started booking our guests for 2015 including Simon Fisher-Becker from Dr. Who &amp; Harry Potter, along with the wonderful Voice Actor Todd Haberkorn whome many of you have been asking for.  We have more great announcements to come, but they will be even better if you take a look at the Perks and get some cool stuff while helping RocCon to meet it's goal of even more iconic guests!</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">       How does getting a star work?  Well, finding the agents come first.   Then when you find an agent who has a person you want at your con, you agree on a number of things.  They are:  A guaranteed fee amount,  M</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">ost stars require first class airfare, 4 to 5 star hotel for at least 3 nights and  what is known as per diem   That is a set amount of money they get per day to use for their expenses while they are here. So you can see, the expenses are numerous.</span></p>
<p>We've had quite a few requests for talent from the UK.  That is an especially expensive proposition.  </p>
<p>If we go over our goal, we will put all the money into bringing in guests from all the genres (comics, sci fi, anime &amp; gaming) so you have the most fun and variety at RocCon!.</p>
<p>    With your help, we can run the same great show from 2014 and bring in some othre very well known stars that will make your fan-meter go wild!   Thank you.  Now, GO!  Check out YOUR PERKS!!!  Then go get em!<br/></p>

</div><div> <p>   The biggest challenge we have are the competing conventions.  We have to show agents that we can compete for their clients.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After our project is successfully funded, the only real obstacles we run into are</p>
<p>1. Availability of the stars we want for our Convention Weekend.  We are in competition with every major convention in the Country and even some outside of the USA.  </p>
<p>2. Cancellation of guests.  If someone has to cancel, we will quickly attempt to find a replacement.   Most of their contracts do have cancellation clauses for various reasons.</p>
<p>3. While we are always looking for suggestions for guests, donating to this Kickstarter does not mean we have to bring in a particular guest suggested by any one person who donates.</p>

Remember Eric Smith, the voice of  Team Rocket's James?  He was also there for the fun!! 1800 of you came to have fandom fun over our first 3-day event! We can't forget our wonderful comic book guests as well!
   2013 brought us Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, Chris Doohan, Vic Mignogna, Erica Schroeder and of course, JG along with a wonderful slew of comic creators and about 2300 Fun Fandom people! 

   2014 RocCon was just beyond incredible!  We stepped up our game and moved the show to  a location with more parking, wonderful event rooms and theatres, great dealer's space, elevators and escalators!     YOU responded by showing up in droves from up to 6 hours away!    And once again, you rose the attendance numbers significantly as more and more of you discovered the little con that could. 
  Vic Mignogna was back for an unprecedented 3rd RocCon appearance,  Star Trek's Brent Spiner, the incredible voice actor Billy West, the lovely Alaina Huffman, Next Gen's Tim McCormack and Star Wars Bonnie Piesse rounded out our guest list to roars of happiness from our conventioneers!  The first-ever RocCon Food Truck rodeo kept hunger pangs at bay all weekend!
                We've already started booking our guests for 2015 including Simon Fisher-Becker from Dr. Who & Harry Potter, along with the wonderful Voice Actor Todd Haberkorn whome many of you have been asking for.  We have more great announcements to come, but they will be even better if you take a look at the Perks and get some cool stuff while helping RocCon to meet it's goal of even more iconic guests!
       How does getting a star work?  Well, finding the agents come first.   Then when you find an agent who has a person you want at your con, you agree on a number of things.  They are:  A guaranteed fee amount,  Most stars require first class airfare, 4 to 5 star hotel for at least 3 nights and  what is known as per diem   That is a set amount of money they get per day to use for their expenses while they are here. So you can see, the expenses are numerous.
We've had quite a few requests for talent from the UK.  That is an especially expensive proposition.  
If we go over our goal, we will put all the money into bringing in guests from all the genres (comics, sci fi, anime & gaming) so you have the most fun and variety at RocCon!.
    With your help, we can run the same great show from 2014 and bring in some othre very well known stars that will make your fan-meter go wild!   Thank you.  Now, GO!  Check out YOUR PERKS!!!  Then go get em!

Risks & Challenges
    The biggest challenge we have are the competing conventions.  We have to show agents that we can compete for their clients.

After our project is successfully funded, the only real obstacles we run into are
1. Availability of the stars we want for our Convention Weekend.  We are in competition with every major convention in the Country and even some outside of the USA.  
2. Cancellation of guests.  If someone has to cancel, we will quickly attempt to find a replacement.   Most of their contracts do have cancellation clauses for various reasons.
3. While we are always looking for suggestions for guests, donating to this Kickstarter does not mean we have to bring in a particular guest suggested by any one person who donates.

<li>FOCS is a community-powered collective of stay at home and working parents.  Since April 2013, FOCS as an informal organization has grown quickly in the first year of offering parenting support &amp; professional workshops for mostly mothers and children and connecting new families.  In the past four months a collective of mothers, affectionately called ""Builders,"" with our little ones in tow, have researched weekly, telecommuted and worked during playdates to deliver many organizational developments.  We have since become a WA state registered 501c3 non-profit, with our current fiscal sponsor, <a href=""http://www.openarmsps.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Open Arms Perinatal Services</a> to provide administrative support.  We have a wonderful and talented Board of Directors guiding our transition from being a one year old community organization, which mainly supported mothers and children.  Currently, our team of parents and consultants now are growing FOCS into a larger community cultural cornerstone with a brick and mortar to grow programming from Conerstone Café to serve greater numbers of families with more cultural resources.  We are learning together, many of us transitioning our careers to be inclusive of our children and integrating our new livelihoods to connect with other families in the community who are desiring communal intentional spaces of discovery, love and play.  This LABOR OF LOVE has been an incredible learning curve as stay at home working-organzing parents.   We are so-called BIRTHING an organic movement to create a loving community of families of color.  Much of this work happens after 10pm- wee hours between middle of the night time feedings and the quiet of night.  Teleconferences, babies in arms, screeching, food trails, escaping toddlers and multi-tasking patient/distracted mamas made this organizing journey so humorous and intentional.  Giggles, gratitude and TEARS of all emotions (mostly the babies).. all in a days work with little ones.  And now, <b>we're at capacity and are at the point where we need to serve more families and children with your support! </b>Our learning curve has been an adventure and we're drawing upon so many different talents and interests to become a non-profit and a community cultural cornerstone.  </li>
<li>Our community response to create more progressive family spaces has been a completely organic and home-cooked process, made with love and lots of (baby) tears!  We are a highly educated, driven and professional team of ""BUILDERS"" who are proud to present our community space and programming to all.  YES, we are some mother FOCers!  Our motto: ""pack n play""- we pack in the work, babes play!  We need your support in getting the word out beyond just the parent and child community. <b> Share and engage your network and community to help fuel our innovative and political community based movement. GIVE BIG TO CORNERSTONE CAFE!  </b>

community.  In the spirit of Bob Marley, FOCS Cornerstone Café will be a community cultural base for
children and parents, which will provide entrepreneurial avenues for parents to integrate conscious parenting to perpetuate a global culture of inclusivity, community building and play-centered learning. WE OFFER:  FREE PLAY & workspace for children and parents to enjoy togetherCommunity Cafe, provided by Ariella Bangs, Taste International & Community Arts CreateDrop-in affordable childcare w/play-centered curriculumMulti-lingual story-time with international arts, music & dance programmingCommunity evening forums & workshops with professionals4,000 sqft community garden. Slated to open its doors in October, FOCS
Cornerstone Café is honored to launch at the Hillman City Collaboratory, a co-share work and community
space, and will offer a variety of resources to support and empower all of Seattle’s
multi-cultural families.  Cornerstone Café integrates conscious parenting and perpetuates a global
culture of inclusivity, community building, and play-centered learning. WHY Cornerstone Café? 1.  Seattle rainy days = lack of children play spaces & lots of cabin fever!2.  Southend LOVE = fueling community- based projects and keeping the Southend LOCAL and reflective of our beloved 98118 history of diversity.  3. JOBS!  We're sharing our community's rich international culture and arts.  We provide entrepreneurial avenues for parents to teach global cultures, expression, arts and international languages to all children in our community.   4.  Healthy HAPPY children!  Our shared pursuit of happiness is reflected in our family and the community we build.  Little global citizens mark an engaged community and make the world a little cozier, culturally enriched and informed.  BELEZA! CORNERSTONE CAFÉ's VALUES:global communityinclusivityentrepreneurshipwomen of color & mother leadershipengaged fathers & conscious parentingFUEL OUR CROWD-FUNDING GOAL:  $25,000.  1.  covers costs of the childcare & playspace build-out at the Collaboratory and building a covered outdoors play area in the community garden.2.  supports non-profit development, one year lease at the beautiful Collaboratory and programming staff.  programming revenue and grants & foundations will help underwrite Cornerstone Cafe's programming, scholarships and development.  3.  enables Cornerstone Cafe's start-up costs for technical support, data base and business management systems, technology and training.  We have already received hundreds of hours of pro-bono IT, PR, Branding & Media and numerous professional consultations to help us make informed decisions, build organizational capacity and provide high-quality services.  Perks gifts are fun ways to represent FOCS in your part of town.  Come enjoy our play space and classes, while you're helping to finance our launch of Cornerstone Cafe!  All contributions are tax-deductible and you'll receive a letter in the mail with our 501c3 tax id.  Even better, have your employer match your contribution to a wonderful cause! Challenges:  
FOCS is a community-powered collective of stay at home and working parents.  Since April 2013, FOCS as an informal organization has grown quickly in the first year of offering parenting support & professional workshops for mostly mothers and children and connecting new families.  In the past four months a collective of mothers, affectionately called ""Builders,"" with our little ones in tow, have researched weekly, telecommuted and worked during playdates to deliver many organizational developments.  We have since become a WA state registered 501c3 non-profit, with our current fiscal sponsor, Open Arms Perinatal Services to provide administrative support.  We have a wonderful and talented Board of Directors guiding our transition from being a one year old community organization, which mainly supported mothers and children.  Currently, our team of parents and consultants now are growing FOCS into a larger community cultural cornerstone with a brick and mortar to grow programming from Conerstone Café to serve greater numbers of families with more cultural resources.  We are learning together, many of us transitioning our careers to be inclusive of our children and integrating our new livelihoods to connect with other families in the community who are desiring communal intentional spaces of discovery, love and play.  This LABOR OF LOVE has been an incredible learning curve as stay at home working-organzing parents.   We are so-called BIRTHING an organic movement to create a loving community of families of color.  Much of this work happens after 10pm- wee hours between middle of the night time feedings and the quiet of night.  Teleconferences, babies in arms, screeching, food trails, escaping toddlers and multi-tasking patient/distracted mamas made this organizing journey so humorous and intentional.  Giggles, gratitude and TEARS of all emotions (mostly the babies).. all in a days work with little ones.  And now, we're at capacity and are at the point where we need to serve more families and children with your support! Our learning curve has been an adventure and we're drawing upon so many different talents and interests to become a non-profit and a community cultural cornerstone.  
Our community response to create more progressive family spaces has been a completely organic and home-cooked process, made with love and lots of (baby) tears!  We are a highly educated, driven and professional team of ""BUILDERS"" who are proud to present our community space and programming to all.  YES, we are some mother FOCers!  Our motto: ""pack n play""- we pack in the work, babes play!  We need your support in getting the word out beyond just the parent and child community.  Share and engage your network and community to help fuel our innovative and political community based movement. GIVE BIG TO CORNERSTONE CAFE!

<p>Hi Everyone!  Me and my wife Geraldine, want to start a Lil' Orbits hot and fresh Mini Donuts Store right here in Rockland County!  We've both lived here in Rockland County our entire life and remember great fresh made donuts growing up at Aunt Molly's in Pearl River and Van Riper's Farm over the border in Woodcliff Lake, NJ.  Even Dunkin' Donuts <strong>USED TO </strong>make their donuts fresh several times a day before switching to their ""freeze and thaw"" program several years back.</p>

Children with Autism are often drawn to water and other dangerous situations. Accidental drowning accounts for 90% of the deaths of children with Autism (AWAARE). This campaign is raising money to get service dogs for four young children with Autism who are often drawn to water and other dangerous situations.The simple presence of a service dog has been shown to keep children out of harm's way while also lowering blood pressure, calming the child, and providing outlets for interaction for a child who can't seem to 'fit in' anywhere else.


Families of children with Autism often struggle on a daily basis to keep their children out of harms way while also leading a normal life. Sometimes it is impossible for these parents and children to find peace of mind in the most simplest of situations. 

Please help protect these children by donating now.




A successful campaign will mean peace of mind, hope, security, freedom and safety for these four children with Autism, and many more children with Autism if we are able to exceed our goal of $50,000. 

Words from the parents of these four children:
""Everything we do and everywhere we go has potential dangers for DJ. Having a trained service dog will give us security knowing he is safe."" 

""Most people don't know that our kids are prone to wandering and that they are attracted to water. They run into traffic, they don't respond to their name when called, and they don't understand danger."" 

""There are days that hope is all I have to get me through. When Kip is having a really off day and I have no idea how to make it better, I just hope.""

""Autism affects every facet of our lives. It is always a beautiful thing when we join forces to help one another.""

<p>If you already know LeRoy, you know how happy it makes him to feed good food to people. If you don't know LeRoy, you should know that his cooking from his grandma's recipes were the reason for Jean Albert's (in Hallville and on Somerset in downtown Ottawa) and Detroit Soul Food (on Gladstone).</p>
<p>What you may not know: LeRoy was the pioneer in Ottawa soul food—before he turned up, no Ottawa restaurants offered chicken and waffles, and a request that the kitchen dish up mac 'n' cheese on the side just made your server look at you kinda funny.</p>
<p>LeRoy is going to open a new place and satisfy your cravings. But he needs his Ottawa FAM to help him get set up.</p> </div>
<div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>To open a new place, LeRoy needs $33,000 start-up money to rent, equip, and supply the space, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>deep fryers</li>
<li>stovetop/griddle/oven</li>
<li>refrigerators</li>
<li>waffle makers</li>
<li>hot and cold holding units</li>
<li>heat lamps</li>
<li>shelving and lighting</li>
<li>prep tables</li>
<li>cleaning supplies</li>
<li>signs</li>
<li>printing (like business cards 'n' such)</li>
</ul>
<p>Plus LeRoy needs to <b>train up and pay a staff</b>. You read that right—this time, LeRoy won't be on his own. Also, he's keen to teach someone on the staff what he knows about cooking soul food.</p>
<p>He'll need money to pay the landlord first and last month's rent, of course, but also the building contractor, the lawyer, the accountant, and this-here fundraising website: Indiegogo. (Everyone else involved in the fundraising—it's just me, Doug!—is doing it all for free.) Plus, LeRoy has to pay income tax on everything you give. That's a big part of the reason he's asking as much as he is.</p>
<p>There have been a lot of voices raised on Facebook and on Twitter telling LeRoy they're behind him. This is Ottawa's chance to turn the talk into action and show LeRoy how stand-up a city we are, particularly when the reward is authentic soul food for ourselves, our families, and our visitors.</p>
<p>Speaking of rewards, here are some of things you can get if you support this campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fried chicken (with or without waffles--but trust me, get the waffles)! People rave about how good LeRoy's real fried chicken is. It's what fried chicken is supposed to taste like. My mother is an amazing cook, and LeRoy's fried chicken is way better. (Sorry, Mom!)</li>
<li>Fame! Being a local hero might not be as good as fried chicken (because what <i>is</i>?) but you can see your name on LeRoy's new menu. That's right, LeRoy will choose a dish and you will decide what it's called. You don't have to name it after yourself (because this would be worth serious points with your spouse!) but no one will blame you if you do.</li>
<li>A food-for-life subscription! Imagine being able to walk into LeRoy's new place every week, knowing that the bill is already paid.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What is Soul Food, Anyway?</h3>
</div><p>It's comfort food, southern-style.</p>
<ul>
<li>Main dishes like fried chicken (with waffles!), ham hocks, and pork ribs</li>
<li>Side dishes like mac 'n' cheese, black-eyed peas, collard greens, cornbread</li>
<li>Desserts like sweet potato pie</li>
</ul><p>And if you don't get the whole thing with the waffles, then don't worry. Lots of people don't until they try it for the first time. Your chance to try it is coming soon!</p><p>LeRoy's soul food comes from the family recipes he learned from his grandma Theria Jones.</p>

</ul>
<p></p>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></h3>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Background: </span></h3>
<p>The total human toll since the start of the Syrian civil war 4 years ago has been heavy. With 9 million in need of aid and protection, and 2.5 million displaced, the UN has declared it the worst humanitarian crisis of the 21st century.</p>
<p>Right now there are about 600,000+ Druze living in the southern part of Syria called Jabal al-Druze. ISIS and al-Nusra (sister terrorist group) have almost surrounded the whole Druze community and they are not backing down. Amongst the Druze, there are only about 160,000 able-bodied men who are willing to defend their families and homes with their lives, but their willingness is not enough to put up a good fight.</p>
<p>This campaign is a collaboration with the fundraising efforts of the Druze community in Israel, who are spearheading an effort to raise funds within local villages for their brethren in Syria. A similar endeavour by the Israeli Druze was made in the past during the Lebanese civil war to get money to Lebanese Druze, and because of that, the Druze survived the war. The current situation in Syria is already much more serious than what happened in Lebanon 25 years ago, and they need our help today more than ever.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">How the funds will be used:</span><br/>
</h3>
<p><i>TO HELP WITH PURCHASE OF FOOD</i></p>
<ul><li><p>Unstable food prices</p></li></ul>
<p>A few months ago, flour cost USD1.29/kg. Today it is USD12.95/kg - a 1000% increase! There is great price fluctuation for food, and it is not clear how much prices will change in the days leading up to ISIS’ attack. The Druze need the funds so that they are financially able to overcome potential price shocks.</p><ul><li><p>Purchasing food after the attack is dangerous</p></li></ul>
<p>When ISIS attacks, the siege does not end till whole cities are captured. When this happens, the Druze need to have a ready and lasting stockpile of food as entering and leaving the community safely may not be possible. Helping the Druze build this stockpile will decrease unnecessary risks they may have to take while under attack.</p>
<br/><p><i>TO HELP WITH PURCHASE OF DEFENSE EQUIPMENT</i></p>
<ul><li><p>No official protection from ISIS threat</p></li></ul>
<p>The Syrian Druze are no match to ISIS’ arsenal of battle equipment, weaponry, and seemingly endless funding. Neither are they being protected by any official armed forces. Some of the money will go to arming Druze men with weapons to defend the community.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Last summer there was a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xh-0FbMcae8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">video</a> circulating on the Internet showing a helicopter rescue of desperate Iraqi Yazidis escaping ISIS. The Syrian Druze will soon find themselves in a similar circumstance if they are unable to defend themselves. Their situation is desperate. </p><p>Do not sit by and do nothing. Edmund Burke said all that is necessary for evil to triumph is that good men do nothing. There is an overwhelming kind of helplessness that we experience when faced with conflicts like this. It often cripples us from taking action. But let's try to leave this helplessness behind and give just as we can. In these tough times, even the smallest donation can make a real difference. </p><p><span>$2,500 is a huge amount for me personally, yet I have faith that we can exceed even this goal. The Druze in Syria need all the money they can get. And if you are unable to donate, that's okay too. It would mean so much to me if you could just spread the word on your social media platforms :)</span></p></div>","I know many of you do not fully comprehend what's going on in Syria.

Background: 
The total human toll since the start of the Syrian civil war 4 years ago has been heavy. With 9 million in need of aid and protection, and 2.5 million displaced, the UN has declared it the worst humanitarian crisis of the 21st century.
Right now there are about 600,000+ Druze living in the southern part of Syria called Jabal al-Druze. ISIS and al-Nusra (sister terrorist group) have almost surrounded the whole Druze community and they are not backing down. Amongst the Druze, there are only about 160,000 able-bodied men who are willing to defend their families and homes with their lives, but their willingness is not enough to put up a good fight.
This campaign is a collaboration with the fundraising efforts of the Druze community in Israel, who are spearheading an effort to raise funds within local villages for their brethren in Syria. A similar endeavour by the Israeli Druze was made in the past during the Lebanese civil war to get money to Lebanese Druze, and because of that, the Druze survived the war. The current situation in Syria is already much more serious than what happened in Lebanon 25 years ago, and they need our help today more than ever.



How the funds will be used:

TO HELP WITH PURCHASE OF FOOD
Unstable food prices
A few months ago, flour cost USD1.29/kg. Today it is USD12.95/kg - a 1000% increase! There is great price fluctuation for food, and it is not clear how much prices will change in the days leading up to ISIS’ attack. The Druze need the funds so that they are financially able to overcome potential price shocks.Purchasing food after the attack is dangerous
When ISIS attacks, the siege does not end till whole cities are captured. When this happens, the Druze need to have a ready and lasting stockpile of food as entering and leaving the community safely may not be possible. Helping the Druze build this stockpile will decrease unnecessary risks they may have to take while under attack.
TO HELP WITH PURCHASE OF DEFENSE EQUIPMENT
No official protection from ISIS threat
The Syrian Druze are no match to ISIS’ arsenal of battle equipment, weaponry, and seemingly endless funding. Neither are they being protected by any official armed forces. Some of the money will go to arming Druze men with weapons to defend the community.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Last summer there was a video circulating on the Internet showing a helicopter rescue of desperate Iraqi Yazidis escaping ISIS. The Syrian Druze will soon find themselves in a similar circumstance if they are unable to defend themselves. Their situation is desperate. Do not sit by and do nothing. Edmund Burke said all that is necessary for evil to triumph is that good men do nothing. There is an overwhelming kind of helplessness that we experience when faced with conflicts like this. It often cripples us from taking action. But let's try to leave this helplessness behind and give just as we can. In these tough times, even the smallest donation can make a real difference. $2,500 is a huge amount for me personally, yet I have faith that we can exceed even this goal. The Druze in Syria need all the money they can get. And if you are unable to donate, that's okay too. It would mean so much to me if you could just spread the word on your social media platforms :)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

It was constructed in the early 1800s by Somerset County ship builder Elisha Riggin.  It's one of very few remaining ""telescope""
houses on the Eastern Shore, and is considered
exceptional because of it's unaltered and highly unusual woodwork. 
It sits in the middle of 9 secluded acres of meadow, woods, farmland

access to the Pocomoke Sound.<br/></span><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><br/>I'm a career musician.

Thanks to you, we are now able to move forward and begin work stabilizing this wonderful building. Over the next 12 months, I will be working on finding and applying for grants. I'll be keeping a journal of our progress. Please feel free to reach out to us at thewoodandstoneretreat@gmail.com



""The Nelson Homestead / Wood and Stone Retreat is a very exciting project with a high probability of success. It is unique in its multiple contributions to Historic Preservation, Arts & Culture, Education and Tourism. We believe it is an important piece of the puzzle toward re-energizing the economy of Crisfield and a wonderful utilization of an existing 'at risk' Heritage resource here on the Lower Eastern Shore."" The Lower Eastern Shore Heritage Areas Council
This
year, Preservation Maryland (partner of the National Trust for
Historic Preservation) declared The Nelson Homestead one of the top 10 most important endangered historic properties in the state of
Maryland. Only with your help will I be able to provide stewardship and prevent this wonderful site from being lost to time.

My name is Jennifer Smith. The Nelson Homestead has been in my family for half a century. It was constructed in the early 1800s by Somerset County ship builder Elisha Riggin.  It's one of very few remaining ""telescope""
houses on the Eastern Shore, and is considered
exceptional because of it's unaltered and highly unusual woodwork. 
It sits in the middle of 9 secluded acres of meadow, woods, farmland
and wetlands, bordered on the East by Johnson's Creek which provides
access to the Pocomoke Sound.I'm a career musician. For over 20 years my husband, Scott and I have been writing, performing, recording and teaching music around the country.  When I inherited this property in 2012, we began working on how we might create a ""job"" for this house so that, through programming, grant funding and the occasional rental, it will be able to cover it's own upkeep costs.  That's how The Wood and Stone Retreat was born.

Now in it's second year, Scott and I
bring together the nation's top songwriters with musicians from around the country for a 5 day music workshop retreat at the
State Park, 3 miles from the Nelson Homestead.  Each session, we collaborate with the local high school and the community to provide learning opportunities and a free concert event. We love seeing our guests charmed by the
beautiful town of Crisfield and this magical
property. We're excited by the potential of The Nelson Homestead as an artist retreat and Heritage Site and as a contributor to the arts and economy in Somerset County.

For
the past 3 years I've been working with old house specialists,
county, state and federal agencies, contractors, business advisors and friends.  I've been overwhelmed by the ideas and enthusiasm I've
received from so many of you. If it wasn't for your huge outpouring
of encouragement, I probably wouldn't have gotten this far. We now have a well planned strategy and an excellent team  – It's time to get this job done!

Old
houses tell a story. They provide a chronicle. They ground us with a
sense of place and time.They
give us comfort and perspective on where we fit in this huge,
sometimes impersonal world.
Please help us save this unique and important piece of Maryland
history. Together, we can turn it into a destination for musicians, artists and everyone
longing to retreat back to a simpler time and a one of a kind experience on Maryland's remote Lower Eastern Shore.

What We Need 

Our fundraising goal is $168,000 which, combined with anticipated historic preservation grants, will provide for full a rehabilitation of The Nelson Homestead.
Just $50,000 raised will allow us to successfully complete Phase 1 of the project - stabilizing the house and preventing the rapid deterioration that is happening right now.  With Phase 1 funding we will:


secure needed preservation consultants & engineers 

repair / improve driveway access
install electrical wiring
repair a rotted section of foundation
stabilize the chimneys
repair / rebuild the roof
The balance of our goal will be put toward completing the exterior wood repair and interior rehabilitation: consultations, repairing floors, windows, fireplaces, molding, plaster, finishing electric wiring, bath and plumbing.  If we exceed our fundraising goal, we will use the additional $$s to continue grounds improvements and begin implementing projects with the Lower Shore community and beyond including concert events, music education, heritage and environmental conservation programming.I hope you'll consider making a tax deductible donation of any amount to help preserve this place in
Maryland’s history. I hope you will come visit and experience this place with your
family and friends. If
you can't make a donation, I hope you will share our story and
campaign to spread the word so others can join in our efforts.  
Thank You!
GREAT PERKS! In addition to a tax deduction, here are just a few of the Perks we're offering: (we are willing to get creative, so feel free to ask us about mix and match perks/perk combinations)

<h3>Paint Out Loud! A Community Art Project.</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Edward Hopper said, <i>""What I wanted to do was paint sunlight on the side of a house."" </i>Color reflects light, and <b>color inspires life.</b> Our mission at Buffalove is to breathe life into our communities, through hard work and LOVE. We believe that where you invest your love, you invest your life.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Today, we are launching a campaign to fund a community art project in Buffalo, NY.</p>
<p>Our goal is to bring fresh paint to 3 houses on our street - Massachusetts Avenue -  on the West Side of Buffalo. We have already committed our time and resources to restoring and painting our own properties <a href=""http://buffalovedevelopment.com/351-massachusetts-goes-bold/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">[see colors here!]</a>, but we need your help to spread the Buffalove! </p>
<p>Our street has suffered many years of dwindling population, but it's also held together by a strong, tight-knit, upstanding community. What better way to express this strength than through bold, bright splashes of color? No construction paper hearts this time <a href=""http://blog.preservationnation.org/2012/02/14/heart-bombs-and-love-stories-how-buffalos-preservation-power-couple-celebrates-valentines-day/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">[Check out our heart bomb preservation project!]</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><i>When</i> (no ""if""s allowed here, this is Buffalo after all, and we BELIEVE!) we meet our goal, we will distribute applications to every house on our street. We will look for homes with a bright future - with caring owners, dedicated to their property and our community - and we will help turn it up a few watts. We will work with homeowners to capture the spirit and vibrancy of our neighborhood - <b>the bolder, the better </b>- and promise not to be disappointed when not everyone chooses <a href=""http://buffalovedevelopment.com/paint-colors-for-351-massachusetts/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sherbet and magenta</a> like we do!</p>
<p></p>
<div>Painting will begin in the spring 2014, or as soon as the weather allows.<p></p>
<p><b> $5,000 per house. 3 houses. $15,000.</b></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>We hope you believe in Buffalo's future as much as we do. At Buffalove we are dedicated to our work. A drop in the proverbial [paint] bucket to you sends ripples through our community and adds energy to its revitalization. Help us bring color to these homes, help us paint the sunlight.<p></p>

<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need 5,000 dollars per house. That will cover the paint, materials and most of the labor. You get to brag to folks that you've helped contribute to the Buffalo renaissance!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Nitty Gritty Details - Progress, Cash &amp; Implementation</h3>All donations will go directly to this art project - 100%. We will continue to report the progress of this project on our website. We will dedicate our time, energy and brain matter to ensure the houses are painted well and within budget. We will try our hardest to get volunteers to help paint to bring costs down. <p>If there is extra cash left because we saved money or whatnot, we will do another house or paint something in the community (ex: a porch, benches... maybe a fence or wall). The goal is to stretch this as much as we can so we create a street filled with color!</p>
<p>Note: The painters will practice lead safe practices and the workers and paint products be locally sourced.</p>

<p>It’s been only 12 months since I dreamt of how I was going to change the landscape for current and future women entrepreneurs globally including the next generation of little girls and boys. It’s so important that they see and believe that being an entrepreneur is a choice, and that the choice can be made while still in school. It’s been merely 27 weeks since we started building the juggernaught and the story of Rare Birds – the true essence of a entrepreneur’s bootstrapped lean start-up.</p>
<p>I wanted to make sure I walked the talk with this build. That we found the best players in the world, that we worked lean, that we scoured the planet for the best tools and resources so we could be be smarter, faster, more efficient and create greater impact.</p>
<p>I have literally had thousands of conversations about Rare Birds with industry potential investors, partners and sponsors, entrepreneurs, government, educators and academics, emerging entrepreneurs, thought leaders, corporate champions, and family and friends.</p>

<p>I wanted to have thousands of conversations. I wanted to know what people really thought about entrepreneurship in Australia, and globally, what we are doing well and what we are stuffing up.</p>
<p>Also what government, industry, councils, leaders, investors, and money people are missing, what they have hit the nail on the head with. I wanted to know why women are starting businesses in droves, why school girls don’t know what an entrepreneur is, and why primary and high school principals can’t name an Australian entrepreneur, male or women. I wanted to know why women who lead entrepreneurial ventures are getting “growth stuck,” and why so few are scaling globally.</p>
<p>Rare Birds is your tribe. A place where you can be part of the conversation, where there is no superiority or inferiority complexes. Where you can learn, grow, mentor, be mentored, find funding, be an investor, attend events, buy a fantastic book and gift that to a school girl and to a school, and see absolutely no barriers to entry to becoming the entrepreneur you want to be.</p>

At mobidart, we give business owners peace of mind by
providing free mobile websites that require no effort on their part, so they
can focus on their business and customers. This means that we do everything
from creating the site, writing unique content, and hosting the page,

Small businesses have no time or money to spare, and they’re struggling—they’re
the backbone of our economy, after all!  
We support community businesses by providing free mobile
websites that they will never have to pay for. 
Each mobile website is composed of a home, about, services,
and contact page that is easily viewed from a mobile device. A map with
directions, tap-to-call button, contact form, and social linking are also
available to assure ease of use and contact ability. With a map and directions listed on the free mobidart mobile

have already helped over a thousand businesses, but we need your support to reach our goal of delivering 8,000 free
turnkey mobile websites into the hands of small business owners across America.How awesome are your websites?
 
Glad you asked. They’re
mobile-compatible.  We create sites for every industry.  We do ALL
the work for the business owners, so they
don’t have to lift a finger. And, did I mention they’re completely
free?What do you need from me?
Help mobidart,
help small businesses everywhere. It’s that simple.  When
you’re out and about, where do you look for a place to eat, a hotel, or even a
grocery store?  Your phone, right?  Businesses without a mobile
website are missing out on this—and until now, they had to either spend a bunch
of money or commit a significant amount of time to overcome the stumbling block
to entry into the online world. Mobidart.com
simply found a way to remove the barriers of entry completely. How awesome is that?",38.0,0,"1 Campaign

Your support will allow us to keep producing fabulous fiction for your reading pleasure. We also offer a variety of perks as an expression of our appreciation.</p><br/><h2>The Long Pitch, With Explanations Of Who We Are, What We Do and Why We Need Your Support:</h2><p>Founded in 2005, <a href=""http://www.hrbpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hadley Rille Books</a> is a quality small press that publishes exceptional titles in fantasy, science fiction, and historical fiction. Our critically acclaimed authors craft a variety of worlds with diverse, complex characters, including everyday people who face extraordinary challenges. </p><p>We believe that the literary world needs more diverse voices, so we make a special effort to publish more women authors and to offer stories that feature women in prominent roles. Our stories portray both women and men as active, complex, interesting characters. Our novels, novellas, and short stories feature women of all ages and from all walks of life who play key roles in the histories of their people. In addition, Hadley Rille has made a professional commitment to help encourage and promote women’s involvement in the SFF community through projects like the <a href=""http://heroinesoffantasy.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Heroines of Fantasy</a> blog and author appearances on panels and at conventions that engage with women’s changing roles as both authors and characters. </p><p>Our authors and their work have earned many prestigious honors and awards, including Nebula and Hugo nominations. Many of our titles have garnered praise and positive reviews in industry review publications such as Publisher’s Weekly, Booklist, Locus and Library Journal. Our books have made their way into libraries across the globe. Some of our novels are already in translation for distribution in languages other than English; by the end of the decade, Hadley Rille books intends to branch more fully into the international market and reach the hands, minds and hearts of even more readers.</p><p>Hadley Rille Books prides itself on being an independent small press, and we are committed to establishing strong, lasting working relationships with our authors. Small press publishing provides a vital “middle way” between the faceless corporate machine of the big publishing houses and the gutsy if lonely jack-of-all-trades DIY attitude of self-publishing. We like to think that small press publishing is the way publishing really should be: collaborative with and respectful of authors, and focused on the goal of sharing quality stories in attractive packages that delight a diverse audience. We believe that authors can and do come to us in a variety of different ways; that there are so many good stories to tell and wonderful ways to tell them. For this reason, we continue to accept open submissions from both agented and unagented sources, and give a thorough review of every submission received. Indeed, the majority of our published novels and stories were pulled from the “slush pile,” and, while labor-intensive, we have every intention of continuing this submission process.</p><p>But here’s the truth: small press is more often a labor of love than a money-making machine. We are in it for the love of stories, for the joy in sharing good art with an audience who appreciates it. Running a story-centric, collaborative press takes a huge amount of time and energy, both from the creative side and the business side. Up until now, Hadley Rille has been successfully run as a one-man operation by our fearless founder, Eric T. Reynolds, with the capable assistance of a handful of other largely volunteer staff who help with submissions, editing, production and marketing. </p><p>But things are changing: as a press, Hadley Rille has grown. Now we need help getting to the next level, where we can create even better products and get them in front of even more appreciative eyeballs. We have now produced nearly 50 terrific, top-quality titles that we want to continue to share with the world—but our ability to market and sell them with the finite resources we currently have is shrinking. Eric and his assistants can’t do it alone any longer. In order to get to the point where this renewable process of “make books to sell books to make books to sell books” becomes sustainable, we need to make a concerted push to market and sell more titles.</p><p>Here’s where you come in.</p><h2>How You Can Support Hadley Rille Books</h2><p>Here are our goals: </p><ul>
<li>Increase marketing and promotion to let the world know that we have 
something special to offer the publishing world, that our stories are as
 diverse, unique and engaging as the authors who write them. <br/>
</li>
<li>Get more books on the shelves of local brick-and-mortar stores and into readers’ hands. </li>
<li>Create a stronger presence at professional conventions such as Worldcon, World Fantasy, ALA and SCBWI. <br/>
</li>
<li>Sign more authors into the Hadley Rille family.</li>
<li>Maintain a strong list of print, ebook and audio titles with a permanently in-print backlist.</li>

If more people know about our books, we’ll sell more books, and if we sell more books, we’ll have more money to plow back into producing more top-quality products that readers enjoy.  <br/></p><p>Your support will help us employ professional publicists, create compelling marketing materials and opportunities (print and electronic catalogs, website upgrades, online advertising, postcards, bookmarks, flyers, advanced reader copies, presence at professional conferences), and run targeted marketing campaigns in order to boost awareness of and create buzz around our terrific books. We have set our goal at $12,500 because after paying for this campaign and its fees and perks, we think the amount left over will be the minimum amount we will need to reach our initial marketing goals.

Unfortunately these boys were born in the mountain tribes of Thailand and are not considered Thai citizens so they don't have identification which makes it nearly impossible to receive education or a job that's not on the streets.  Urban Light provides a safe place for the boys to eat, sleep, and psychologically and spiritually heal from their horrifying experience. Urban Light then provides empowerment training in the form of reading, writing and math skills as well as basic skills like sewing and cooking in order for them to try to find employment that is safe and stable.  The GCT is partnering with Urban Light to raise prayers, funds and awareness to construct a coffee and pastry shop for the 300 boys Urban Light has taken under their wing.

Please forward this to your friends, family, or church to keep the word spreading! And if you'd like to be even more involved, you can email me at phoenix.eyre@thegct.com and we can chat about ways to further partner with The GCT, Urban Light and the boys of Chiang Mai, Thailand and beyond.

<h3>About Us...</h3>
<p>Axe throwing is a unique sport that quickly becomes addictive once you have stuck your first hatchet. My business partner, Stephanie and I have been throwing and traveling together for a little over a year now and want nothing more than to share the enjoyment of axe throwing with others. We have such love for the sport that we want to level up and run our venue. We have experienced many venues in many locations and we want to be able to put our own flare into presenting the sport to others. We have supported many venues and have seen first hand how amazing the axe world and the people within it are. With Stephanie’s background in business and project management and my design and managerial skills, the plan is to grow the business with our passion and connections we’ve built within the community as our best assets.</p>

<p>We will be bringing this experience to the Buffalo/Grand Island/Niagara Falls region following WATL official standards. One word that is often used to describe the sport is community. It really has a way of bringing folks together no matter the diversity. The sport is growing fast and is quickly becoming an impressive skill to brag to friends about. Another great thing about axe throwing is its a therapeutic stress reliever for all.  Axe throwing facilities are one-of-a-kind entertainment venues that breed a passion for the sport whether you’re simply there to enjoy a good time or you want to train to compete with the best.</p>

<p>Axe throwers use a hatchet and toss it down a fenced lane into a target that is no less than 12 feet away. Throwers can not cross the fault line, a barrier enforced for safety, until a judge deems it time for the player to retrieve their axe. Axe throwing establishments maintain the lanes and targets, provide coaching and ensure that everything meets with insurance and affiliation guidelines.</p>

<p>Axe throwing leagues started in 2006 in one man’s backyard in Toronto, ON Canada and consisted of a bunch of friends looking for something to do. Eventually there was so much interest he rented a space and created the business aspect of the sport in 2011. There are two factions within the sport, originally starting with IATF (International Axe Throwing Federation), formally NATF (National Axe Throwing Federation) and WATL (World Axe Throwing League) which was formed a bit later in 2016. In 2019 there are now more than 125 venues in the United States and 300 locations worldwide. </p>
<p>Our location is a border city and currently there is only one affiliated venue across the border offering IATF leagues and two unaffiliated venues on this side offering a WATL-like system that do not offer leagues. </p>

<h3>We need to raise enough money to give them to her.  </h3>
<p> Josie was a student of mine when I taught at a summer theater program at the Goodman Theatre. I was blown away by her passion, her determination, and her bright, enduring optimism. Josie is now 19 and thriving while studying theater at Northwestern University. </p>
<p>She also has Cystic Fibrosis, her lung function is now down to 22%, and she needs a lung transplant. One of the many reasons I loved getting to know Josie during our summer at the Goodman is that I grew up in a family that was affected by her same disease - my little sister was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis when she was 17 months old. CF is a progressive disease that deteriorates lung function at its own unpredictable rate. There is, as of yet, no known cure. Josie's lungs can no longer function properly, and she needs new ones. </p>
<p>Luckily she is now on the lung transplant list and is just awaiting the call to receive new lungs. However, the cost of this procedure is astronomical, and I am asking for our communities to help alleviate this cost for Josie's family, as they are already struggling to cover other medical expenses. </p>
<p>Cystic Fibrosis is a terrible disease. Thankfully patients like Josie and my sister have the bravery to fight it, and to stay positive and strong while they do so. Someday there will be a cure, but for now, I hope you will consider donating to help Josie breathe freely once again. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>A Note From Josie's Mother...</h3>
<p><span>My 19 year old daughter Josie has a disease called Cystic Fibrosis CF is genetic disease (</span><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.CFF.org&amp;h=sAQFRq5gQ&amp;s=1"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">www.CFF.org</a><span>) that she was diagnosed with at age 4 months. As time has progressed, so has her disease. After suffering a very large loss of lung function (normal is 100%, she now has 22%) in August, she was evaluated for a lung transplant. She was placed on the lung transplant list on December 12, 2012. With e</span><span class=""text_exposed_show"">nd stage lung disease, a lung transplant is the only hope of living. Josie is a Sophomore at Northwestern University, majoring in theater. Up until September, she was an avid equestrian but due to loss of lung function can no longer ride. She is still attending classes at Northwestern while waiting for her transplant. She has never seen herself as the kind of girl who ""just gives up"" or ""sits around feeling sorry for herself"". She knows the call for transplant could come at any time yet she is trying to enjoy her life to the fullest while waiting.

<p><span class=""text_exposed_show""> </span></p></div>","Josie Nordman is a brave and inspiring young woman who needs new lungs. 
We need to raise enough money to give them to her.  
 Josie was a student of mine when I taught at a summer theater program at the Goodman Theatre. I was blown away by her passion, her determination, and her bright, enduring optimism. Josie is now 19 and thriving while studying theater at Northwestern University. 
She also has Cystic Fibrosis, her lung function is now down to 22%, and she needs a lung transplant. One of the many reasons I loved getting to know Josie during our summer at the Goodman is that I grew up in a family that was affected by her same disease - my little sister was diagnosed with Cystic Fibrosis when she was 17 months old. CF is a progressive disease that deteriorates lung function at its own unpredictable rate. There is, as of yet, no known cure. Josie's lungs can no longer function properly, and she needs new ones. 
Luckily she is now on the lung transplant list and is just awaiting the call to receive new lungs. However, the cost of this procedure is astronomical, and I am asking for our communities to help alleviate this cost for Josie's family, as they are already struggling to cover other medical expenses. 
Cystic Fibrosis is a terrible disease. Thankfully patients like Josie and my sister have the bravery to fight it, and to stay positive and strong while they do so. Someday there will be a cure, but for now, I hope you will consider donating to help Josie breathe freely once again. 
 
A Note From Josie's Mother...
My 19 year old daughter Josie has a disease called Cystic Fibrosis CF is genetic disease (www.CFF.org) that she was diagnosed with at age 4 months. As time has progressed, so has her disease. After suffering a very large loss of lung function (normal is 100%, she now has 22%) in August, she was evaluated for a lung transplant. She was placed on the lung transplant list on December 12, 2012. With end stage lung disease, a lung transplant is the only hope of living. Josie is a Sophomore at Northwestern University, majoring in theater. Up until September, she was an avid equestrian but due to loss of lung function can no longer ride. She is still attending classes at Northwestern while waiting for her transplant. She has never seen herself as the kind of girl who ""just gives up"" or ""sits around feeling sorry for herself"". She knows the call for transplant could come at any time yet she is trying to enjoy her life to the fullest while waiting. She is a member of the Chi Omega Sorority and the Northwestern Equestrian team. She is producing a play at Northwestern in the spring if all goes well and someday hopes to study abroad.
We recently found out that our portion of the cost of the lung transplant will be somewhere between $50,000 and $75,000. We were floored! We are struggling to pay our monthly bills due to so many medical costs that we have no idea how to come up with this kind of money. We need a miracle, I am hoping that the kindness of strangers will provide that.
Please help us raise the money we need to be able to pay for our portion of Josie's lung transplant and related expenses. 
Help us help Josie get back to being able to attend school without carrying oxygen, act in shows without worrying about coughing or needing to sit down and help her to again ""fly"" on the back of the horses she loves so much.

<p>My name is Brandon Nueman. I live in Los Angeles, California and have been working in the fishing industry for the past two years. I recently started a project called The Top Catch. Its goal is to help aid the survival of the fishing industry for both the consumer and its businesses.</p>
<p>This is necessary because the economy has ravaged this industry. Guides, who were once on the water 300 days a year, now sit at 100 days; and they are starting to end their businesses due to this gigantic decrease in revenue. Over the past year, I have personally witnessed over 40 guides end their business. It is due to this, that I started thinking of ways to help bring them more customers.</p>
<p>I then asked myself, my family, and my friends what would bring both new and old customers back into the fold for these fishermen? Luckily, I married a brilliant woman who said, “Brandon, you love blueberries. Every time they are on sale, you buy three packages of them…. But, you only buy them on sale. Why is that?”</p>
<p>That’s when it hit me. People want to go fishing, they need to go fishing. They just need to be reminded of that and shown that they are getting a deal. I searched the web and found that Groupon has actually done this in a few cases and the consumers went crazy. 1000+ trips booked per listing was normal.</p>
<p>Thus, <a href=""http://www.thetopcatch.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">thetopcatch.com</a> was born.</p>
<p><strong>What I Need…..</strong></p>
<p>Today, The Top Catch has a filler page while the true website is being built. But with your help, I will be able to get it and keep it up. Please donate on Indiegogo  to make this dream a reality.</p>
<p>The website and its graphic design are going to cost me a little over $1500 {See gallery of what the site is going to look like}. The other costs, such as SEO ($300 per month) and email marketing ($250 per month) will cost significantly more; but, they will most likely come once I can fit them into a monthly budget. Any help that you can give will go to making this site easier to find for the public.</p>
<h3>What's In It For You?</h3>
<p>Beyond being awesome and believing that I can help change the fishing industry forever….. I have set up specific “thank you gifts” in exchange for your contributions. You will see them on the right hand side of this page.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help…..</strong></p>
<p>The economy is in a pretty dreadful state, and money is tight for many people. This is what has gotten me to setup the site in the first place. Please do not feel obliged to contribute. There are other ways you can help too:</p>
<p>Tell others about this project: blog it, tweet it, facebook it, tell your friends and family {Indiegogo has some sharing tools if needed}. Every little bit helps!</p>
<p>Leave a positive comment as the more traffic and activity on the campaign, the more visible it becomes on the site!</p>

<p> </p></div>","Why Does This Matter?
My name is Brandon Nueman. I live in Los Angeles, California and have been working in the fishing industry for the past two years. I recently started a project called The Top Catch. Its goal is to help aid the survival of the fishing industry for both the consumer and its businesses.
This is necessary because the economy has ravaged this industry. Guides, who were once on the water 300 days a year, now sit at 100 days; and they are starting to end their businesses due to this gigantic decrease in revenue. Over the past year, I have personally witnessed over 40 guides end their business. It is due to this, that I started thinking of ways to help bring them more customers.
I then asked myself, my family, and my friends what would bring both new and old customers back into the fold for these fishermen? Luckily, I married a brilliant woman who said, “Brandon, you love blueberries. Every time they are on sale, you buy three packages of them…. But, you only buy them on sale. Why is that?”
That’s when it hit me. People want to go fishing, they need to go fishing. They just need to be reminded of that and shown that they are getting a deal. I searched the web and found that Groupon has actually done this in a few cases and the consumers went crazy. 1000+ trips booked per listing was normal.
Thus, thetopcatch.com was born.
What I Need…..
Today, The Top Catch has a filler page while the true website is being built. But with your help, I will be able to get it and keep it up. Please donate on Indiegogo  to make this dream a reality.
The website and its graphic design are going to cost me a little over $1500 {See gallery of what the site is going to look like}. The other costs, such as SEO ($300 per month) and email marketing ($250 per month) will cost significantly more; but, they will most likely come once I can fit them into a monthly budget. Any help that you can give will go to making this site easier to find for the public.
What's In It For You?
Beyond being awesome and believing that I can help change the fishing industry forever….. I have set up specific “thank you gifts” in exchange for your contributions. You will see them on the right hand side of this page.
Other Ways You Can Help…..
The economy is in a pretty dreadful state, and money is tight for many people. This is what has gotten me to setup the site in the first place. Please do not feel obliged to contribute. There are other ways you can help too:
Tell others about this project: blog it, tweet it, facebook it, tell your friends and family {Indiegogo has some sharing tools if needed}. Every little bit helps!
Leave a positive comment as the more traffic and activity on the campaign, the more visible it becomes on the site!
Thanks for your time and support, it is greatly appreciated!

<p> </p>
<p>Six years ago I started grilling for my friends in the backyard. I thought I was doing up some good “barbecue” but it was only good grilling. At a local BBQ event a Pitmaster told me that true barbecue was low and slow. He gave me some tips and told me to practice every weekend. So I did. During this time I created a blog called Nor Cal BBQ to talk about my leaning experience. I also went to culinary school to learn the basics of cooking for commercial kitchens. <span> </span></p>
<p>Since the start of my barbecue dream I have worked for mom and pop restaurants and for some of the biggest companies in California while teaching myself how to do true barbecue. Now its time to take what I have learned and put it to the test. Now its time to travel the Nation doing some of the biggest shows in barbecue vending.</p>
<p>My goal with this indiegogo campaign is to raise a least $20,000 to purchase a smoker, trailer, several grills and the needed materials to travel the nation. I have put together a team of people willing to go on this barbecue dream with me. We want to serve the masses.</p>
<p> <img alt=""Bision in the Snow"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://fotos.fotoflexer.com/709979d754c75476341257afefd57787.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Cold Bison""/><img alt=""Bison on the range"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://fotos.fotoflexer.com/66811e9921ab2a5c30765dabc7bf9782.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""Bison Eatting ""/></p>
<p>What makes us different then other barbecue companies is we serve Bison or otherwise known as Buffalo. Bison is leaner, contains less fat and cholesterol. It’s a red meat that is good for you. In the last decade Bison Ranchers have been slowly bring back the mammal that used to roam our wonderful country in the millions. Today the numbers are much smaller but the demand for a healthier meat is on the rise. <span> </span>Bisons are feed all natural materials. They can not be forced fed like other cattle. They need to roam and feed as they go or they do not reach the size needed to produce a product that is commercial grade.</p>
<p>Not only is Bison a healthier way to enjoy red meat but its good for the environment too. They naturally help our grass lands grow. These animals like to be outside year round to roam and graze as needed. They are not fed loads of grains and altered food sources to grow them in size faster then needed. As a barbecue company we want to promote the Bison movement. We want to help Bison Ranchers get the support they need.We want to feed barbecue lovers a better product.</p>
<p>The Buffalo Boys National Tour is all about showing off how we like to barbecue, promote a healthier side to barbecue and to educate the folks that don’t know about Bison and the effect these animals have on our world today. We want to do a least 30 events nation wide. Most of the event for our first year will be on the western part of the country but we are planning trips to Texas, New York, Florida and Michigan too.</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>We will also service Pork products but no traditional beef products. We need to stand out from these teams that have been traveling the country for decades. We are the new kids in the pit. Its going to take time, a lot of effort and constant battling. Bison are still in the low numbers compared to beef. So supply is going to be a constant battle but with the network of Bison Ranchers we are putting together, its going to be possible to serve a healthier product at every event.</p>

Chromosome 21 is the smallest human chromosome, 47 million nucleotides (the building material of DNA) and representing about 1.5 percent of the total DNA in cells.</p>

<div> </div>
<div>As the father of a son who was born with Down syndrome I have been taught by a master that many of life’s most perfect moments and accomplishments are the ones that are not so perfect.</div>
<div>
<p>My son has helped me understand that what the world often considers trivial is in reality truly exceptional and meant to be celebrated. My son absolutely loves accomplishing things; better yet, celebrating them! Even more so!!! The acknowledgement that often comes with it!</p>
<p>A reason to celebrate is exactly what we want not just for <strong>HIM</strong>, but for the hundreds of thousands of people with diverse abilities that face incredible challenges every day. Ultimately, we want to ensure two things. #1) that when he's old enough to work, he will have a fulfilling job waiting for him and that at the end of the day he can look back and be proud of the contributions he has made to his community. #2) To set an example and teach others how they can do it too!</p>

<h3><em><span style=""color: #086b00;""> Club 21c | Down4u</span></em></h3>
<p>Our primary mission is to cultivate an overwhelming desire within Corporate America to shift their respective culture just enough so that everyone within the company has the same desire to make minor changes to their daily operations and join us in our quest to isolate the all-to-often ""Undiscovered Abilities"" many individuals with challenges have. We believe that as each company does so, they will ultimately be empowered to open their doors to hundreds of thousands of incredible individuals who will touch their lives forever and make valuable contributions to each companies success. Each of us, no matter what our conditions; were born with special abilities and talents. When we have an opportunity to exercise them and if we are given an opportunity to succeed, we are able to touch the lives of others in unexpected ways. Through Club 21c Apparel, the Down4u Campaign, and several other planned projects; (some listed here and some not) - we will do just that, create jobs for persons with undiscovered abilities. Through this process we will also create jobs for many qualified, educated, and skilled individuals who currently find themselves out of work as well. We figure, for every three skilled employees, we will be able to employ someone who may be challenged in one way or another but perfectly able to contribute to the success of the company they are hired to work for. As such, everyone involved will be vital to our success and growth.</p>
<p><strong>Oh yea, that reminds me, </strong>if you're interested in a position with one of our companies or in learning more about our programs and training, you can send your resumes and requests to us via my personal linked[in] account!</p>

We have some sample shirts in the gallery and we have a couple of designers working on getting us more but right now what we threw together really hasn't reached the level we desire. None-the-less, since we have learned that from imperfection comes perfection, we believe everyone here will come through for us and that will have dozens of awesome designs to choose from by the end of this campaign! That being said, please click on the graphic below if you want to make a contribution in the form of one of our Founding designs!

Currently, within the Down syndrome community there are no Nationwide subscription based publications in circulation catering to families, educators, community leaders, or medical providers and we intend to change that.

 WHY IS ALMOST EVERYTHING IN HERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE NUMBER 21?

The 21st Chromosome is one of 23 pairs found in us humans. People normally have two copies of this chromosome. The trisomy of the 21st chromosome (an extra little guy that's attached) causes Down Syndrome. Chromosome 21 is the smallest human chromosome, 47 million nucleotides (the building material of DNA) and representing about 1.5 percent of the total DNA in cells.
In 2000, researchers working on the Human Genome Project announced that they had determined the sequence of base pairs that make up this chromosome. Chromosome 21 was the second human chromosome to be fully sequenced. Pretty cool eh!

Miles to go before we sleep...
When I found indiegogo, I knew we were finally 1st down 'n' 20 yards from the top of this mountain... (with your help I know we can reach the top)...
 
As the father of a son who was born with Down syndrome I have been taught by a master that many of life’s most perfect moments and accomplishments are the ones that are not so perfect.

My son has helped me understand that what the world often considers trivial is in reality truly exceptional and meant to be celebrated. My son absolutely loves accomplishing things; better yet, celebrating them! Even more so!!! The acknowledgement that often comes with it!
A reason to celebrate is exactly what we want not just for HIM, but for the hundreds of thousands of people with diverse abilities that face incredible challenges every day. Ultimately, we want to ensure two things. #1) that when he's old enough to work, he will have a fulfilling job waiting for him and that at the end of the day he can look back and be proud of the contributions he has made to his community. #2) To set an example and teach others how they can do it too!

 Club 21c | Down4u
Our primary mission is to cultivate an overwhelming desire within Corporate America to shift their respective culture just enough so that everyone within the company has the same desire to make minor changes to their daily operations and join us in our quest to isolate the all-to-often ""Undiscovered Abilities"" many individuals with challenges have. We believe that as each company does so, they will ultimately be empowered to open their doors to hundreds of thousands of incredible individuals who will touch their lives forever and make valuable contributions to each companies success. Each of us, no matter what our conditions; were born with special abilities and talents. When we have an opportunity to exercise them and if we are given an opportunity to succeed, we are able to touch the lives of others in unexpected ways. Through Club 21c Apparel, the Down4u Campaign, and several other planned projects; (some listed here and some not) - we will do just that, create jobs for persons with undiscovered abilities. Through this process we will also create jobs for many qualified, educated, and skilled individuals who currently find themselves out of work as well. We figure, for every three skilled employees, we will be able to employ someone who may be challenged in one way or another but perfectly able to contribute to the success of the company they are hired to work for. As such, everyone involved will be vital to our success and growth.
Oh yea, that reminds me, if you're interested in a position with one of our companies or in learning more about our programs and training, you can send your resumes and requests to us via my personal linked[in] account!
""Club 21c"", ""Down4u"" & ""MountainsToClimb"" are our main brands and we need a much bigger selection of t-shirt designs!
If you are a designer or if you know one, please send him or her our way!! We have some sample shirts in the gallery and we have a couple of designers working on getting us more but right now what we threw together really hasn't reached the level we desire. None-the-less, since we have learned that from imperfection comes perfection, we believe everyone here will come through for us and that will have dozens of awesome designs to choose from by the end of this campaign! That being said, please click on the graphic below if you want to make a contribution in the form of one of our Founding designs! We will select at least 12-18 designs for our contributors to choose from, more if we really hit this out of the park! (I hope awesome folks at indeigogo lets us do this)!

Perks for submitted designs: Down4U, Club21c, & MountainsToClimb!
Your name & company logo will be listed on our ""Founding Designers"" page for life with a link to 3 of your social media pages and/or websites. With the exception of MountainsToClimb which will get an additional mention in the credits of our documentary as well!!

<h3>This is an urgent call to help this family.</h3>
<p>This family consists of a mom, dad and 3 children who through whatever hurdles life throws their way always put others first.  We need to put this family first for once.</p>
<p>The children are Josh who is 19, Candace who will be 18 on Sept 12 and Parker who will be 15 on Sept 5.  Josh has mild mental retardation and Parker has Aspergers Syndrome. On top of these childrens disabilities, their mother, Samantha,  is disabled with Reflex Sympathetic Disorder and Fibromyalgia and cannot work.  Josh just recently lost his part time job due to his disability. Candace has started looking for a job to help her family but has had no luck.   Josh and Candace are both starting their senior year in  high school. Parker is homeschooled.  Samantha and Todd (mom and dad), through peoples amazements, through all they have been through will be married 22 years on September 22, 2012.  Many people all the time tell them how so many couples would not had stuck together with the turmoil thrown infront of this family and are amazed this has not happened.  Candace as a matter of fact, just made the remark the other day to someone this very statement that through it all her family is still together.  Lets help keep it that way.  We all know how little stressors can tear a family apart, but what this family has endured is too much and each time has been no fault of their own.</p>
<p>This family has been financially ruined by the UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT THREE TIMES.  The stories of each one is heartbreaking for such young people.  Folks, we need to step up and help them because you would NEVER want to endure the hell these 5 people have been through.  A family that not just takes care of their own, but reaches out to others in need, runs a no kill cat shelter, donates to others, etc.  NO family or person that thinks of others and not just what their family does not have, their needs and wants should EVER have to be put through the mill by anyone let alone our goverments.  The family is about to lose their home, they have already had to file bankruptcy because of their current situation caused by retaliation by animal control for Samantha filing a tort claim (lawsuit) against animal control. Because of being sold a house fraudulantly in 1992 these kids have not had the childhood a child should have.  These parents, thinking about their children's needs moved these kids to Depauw Indiana, a small country town to start  life over, to give  these kids a second chance to be kids and low and behold if 1 lone CPS caseworker conspired with 1 lone animal control officer to ultimately DESTROY this family.  This family is struggling and not because of anything they did wrong.  That is what makes this so important, their pleas for help just get over looked.  We need to stand and help this family, let them know we do care about what they do for others.   Show these kids that there are still good people in the world.</p>
<p><strong>If you can contribute ANYTHING that would be great, if not then please share this. This is a current list of what this family needs.</strong></p>
<p>1) They need $1600 to get their mortgage caught up.  The house is in foreclosure which is so ironic.  Samantha on November 16, 2011 helped a lady who was going to be evicted from  her home over feral cats.  This lady ""supposibly"" called in a complaint on Samantha.  Now Samantha, her husband and their children are losing their home.  $500 will be a great start to help get some of it caught up.</p>
<p>2) This family needs 2 vehicles fixed, they now own 5 vehicles of which now 1 is only running, it is a 95 Ford Ranger, in which Todd drives to work and works an hour away from home.   Josh before losing his job bought a car since Samantha's van broke down and within 7 days his car broke down.  They are assuming Josh's car needs an engine so now Josh is out of a car and $2600.  As of date they have a running 95 Ford Ranger, a 95 Kia Sportage with a blown head gasket, 2 99 Dodge Grand Caravans both needing engines and Josh's car a 98 Pontiac Bonnieville that most likely also needs an engine, it will be going to the shop on Monday if they can scrape the money together. </p>
<p>Samantha and todd live without financing things and pay cash for everything  to get caught up on life.  They live within their means, but life is just hammering them to death.  The harder they try to do right and do good and live like they are supposed to the more problems fall upon them.</p>
<p>3) The house was in the middle of being remodeled in winter of 2009 and the repairs  had to be left undone, those are 10 times worse now. The repairs are the basement, the kids bathroom and the kitchen.  The basement is a flooding mess and now retaining wall is caving in.  They need money to pay to have a backhoe to come in and remove the earth, the retaining walls  need torn out and rebuilt and new cement laid.  They are willing to do this work themselves to save money.  The basement will cost around $5000 if they do it on their own.  The kids bathroom just needs flooring so they can replace the broken commode, the commode leaks and they are not sure if they have water damage, but they need the money for the floor which is $200, the faucet for the sink is $135.  They will use existing plumbing for the claw foot tub as it will cost approximately $500 and is not urgent.  The kitchen floor needs replaced and will cost about $500.  The cabinet needs replaced and they are looking second hand for that.  The lower cabinets have water damage and are rotting.</p>
<p>4) The back porch is falling apart, the boards are warped.  Samantha qualifies to get this fixed but the family has been ousted by the community and the humilation is too much for Samantha to go sign up for Repair Affair.  (read further down about being outsted by the community).  The back porch is in a dangerous state especially come this winter.  They are trying to tear it down and build back something to use this winter and be able to add on to it later.  this will cost a minimum of $300 for the need, $700 for what is really needed, but they said, the urgency is something Samantha can use in winter without falling and getting hurt.  The kids as well but they are more agile than Samantha.</p>
<p>5) The family lives in a log cabin, it has been in the process of being stripped and stained since fall of 2009, the logs/chinking need maintanance BADLY and the worst part of it is all the chinking needs to be ripped out and replaced.  The chinking is falling off the house, has holes in it, etc.  These holes allow all sorts of things to get into the house and let air escape outside the house.  This is something easy to fix and the family can do it themselves but it will cost at least $500 to do it right. </p>
<p><strong>Why should you contribute?</strong> </p>
<p>Because like I said, this is a family that puts others first.  Therefore once we make them whole again, give them support they need they are going to be in the postition to further making a difference to other people.  You may need their help someday,  you never know if you will end up like them.  They are currently in a lawsuit over what CPS/Animal Control did, if they win they are going to set up a fund to help others protect their children and their pets.   Imagine if we don't help them now their lawsuit may end.  If we can help them, and this helps this particular lawsuit, they are going to be lobbying for new laws pertaining to pet owners and children.  We need more people willing to take a stand for others and these people are willing to do at their expense.  It is this reason why you need to contribute.  Please make your contribution, $5 is a great contribution.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if we don't raise the money needed? </strong></p>
<p>The money is still needed regardless if we do not raise enough to cover all their needs.  Just helping with $40 a month will help cover their water bill and they can use that money on wood to build a safer back porch for Samantha and the children.  Any amount you contribute is going to impact this family.  When you struggle, $5 extra is a big difference.  I will also keep you up to date with photos of where your money is going.  There are photos of all their vehicles, 2 videos of Josh's car and Samantha's van to prove they need engines.  I will post the estimate as soon as I get it.  Photos of the house are posted as well as videos.  As the money is given to them via paypal they can make immediate repairs and I will post the photos.  You can see yourself the need, the repairs and how this will change this family's life.  We need to help a family that is not greedy and has a heart of gold and feels everyone should help one another.</p>
<p><strong>You want to help but you are struggling yourself?</strong></p>
<p>Alot of us are. All you need to do is post this story everyday for 1 hour all over the internet.  Help get it to someone that can make a contribution.  Sharing this is just as important as making a contribution.  Can you spare just 1 hour a day to get the word out?  That costs nothing out of your pocket and imagine  how many people you can get this to.  Share it on news  reports, on line news papers, facebook, twitter, digg, etc.  You get the idea.</p>
<p><strong>Surely by now you can see the importance of helping this family.</strong> </p>
<p>I haven't even written the entire list of the help this family needs, I have just pointed out the urgent parts.  Can you see the need? Can you imagine what this family can do to help others if they were whole again?   Then please, contribute as little as you can.  It all adds up.  Can you imagine if we got 100,000 people  to donate just $1 how much better this family will be?  And how much this family can continue helping others?  Can you imagine yourself in their shoes in such dire need from being blind sided and destroyed because you chose to stand up for your childrens rights, your constitutional rights?  But yet this family still helps other people while fighting all this.  Most people would had turned their backs on society, but good hearted people like this family don't.  They try to see good in all humans. Please make your contribution today and please share this family's story.</p>
<p><strong>How does this family's struggle currently impact you or those around them?</strong></p>
<p>This family runs a no kill cat shelter and out of retaliation (from the lawsuit) they were raided.  All the animals were taken, charges of abuse were filed when in fact the accussers are the abusers.  Animal control killed 4 of their cats to get charges pressed.  All allegations of abuse are lies and can be proved they are lies.  Due to legality reasons I cannot post everything I know of the evidence against the prosecution, but it is something most people would not be able to handle.  Right now while the parents are fighting these trumped up charges their pets lives sit in limbo.  They need $800 to give to the animals attorney to get their pets home and the shelter will be up and running again.  Their children have begged Samantha to not give up this fight, they will wait as long as they  have to but do not give up their animals or the shelter.  The kids loved working in the shelter and loved helping animals and people. They also  loved having fundraiser parties.  All that is (temporarily) gone but the fact it is gone has impacted MANY, MANY families and cats needing their services.  They still get calls and emails monthly asking for help and they have to turn them down because their lives are in limbo.  Imagine how many cats have died because they can't help, imagine how many families had to give up their cats because the shelters Permenancy Program isn't in operation.  The Permenancy Program is for those facing foreclosure, eviction, deployment, fires, etc that have no where for their cat but do not want to rehome them.  This program gives them a place until the family can take them home.  That to me is a major impact in Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois and Ohio their shelter needs to be up and running.  Make your contribution today, get this family back on their feet so they can continue doing what they enjoy....helping others.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here is the story about how the government has destroyed this family.</p>
<p><strong>First time the government struck July 31, 1992............</strong></p>
<p>Samantha and Todd (the parents) got married 9/22/90 and Samantha wanted to have a family and wanted to move to a family house before having kids, so they sought out and found the house of their dreams in January 1992.  Samantha's mother was put in the hospital in May 1992 and died July 1992, this was while Samantha was 5 months pregnant with Josh.  Samantha had a very  difficult time with her mothers death and they were having trouble with getting the dream home and fought very hard to get it.  When things were starting to dwindel down for them they decided with all the stress, being pregnant, etc that right then just was not a good time to purchase this particular  house.  Samantha and Todd was backing out.  The seller of the house threatened to sue them if they did.  Feeling uneasy about the whole deal they went ahead and went through with the purchase.</p>
<p>Samantha and Randell shortly after moving into the house realized this house no way could had been sold via FHA although they had an FHA loan.</p>
<p>January 1995 Candace was hospitalized with severe pneumonia caused by black mold. She was in a coma for 2 days.  She then had pediatric asthma and seizures.  She outgrew both of those and threw school learned she was mentally delayed, she was 18 months behind her peers.  Candace still struggles but works very hard to get good grades, she hates school but refuses to miss a day, she has worked very hard to get where she is right now and her parents are so proud of her.</p>
<p>There is alot more to this story but for those that don't want to read the whole story I am complining it and the newspaper clippings into a website.  Give me time to get that prepared. Keep checking back.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Second time the government struck December 2009, January 13, 2010 and Febuary 2010</strong></p>
<p>Decemember 15, 2009 CPS was called to the house.  The allegations were unsubstantiated on December 21, 2009</p>
<p>January 13, 2010 really begain on January 6, 2010.  After unsubstantiating the allegations the caseworker decided she wasn't done.  This is a very long part of this and I will give you the link to read it.  But the short of it is this.  Samantha and Todd refused on 5 different days to allowing this same caseworker to open a case on them.  So after collecting information about the no kill cat shelter and the last time of asking the family to allow her to open a case, even telling them she could get them a grant to remodel their home, she went back to her boss and told them that Samantha and Todd were cat hoarders.  With that she got her open case.  CPS has not and refuses to turn over the photos to prove their innocence to Samantha or any of the attorney's that have been on the cases since 2010!!  The description of the house and the photos do not match!  The children were detained without a warrant and no detention hearing was ever held.  Many things that violated this family's rights.  As a matter of fact.  The case was dismissed by CPS because they proved by VET BILLS they were not cat hoarders.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>February 1, 2010 Animal Control killed all 15 cats that he illegally seized.  He stated in a court of law that he did this ""because Samantha never came back for them"".  This was 18 days after he stole these cats from this family.  (I used the terms illegal and stole because the animal control officer lied to a judge to get a search and seizure warrant, that can be verified by the probable cause affidavit and 1 photo and 1 statement.)<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I will post this too, this is about CPS conspiring with animal control because the Lee's refused to agree to the caseworker opening a case on them.</p>
<p>This story is listed on the Frisky Felines Foundation website and also on ratemycaseworker.com.  I will post the info soon.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Third time the goverment struck November 17, 2011...........</strong></p>
<p>Samantha filed a tort claim on animal control over the 2010 incident.  A tort claim is your first step to suing the government in state court.  In November Samantha was set up to take some cats to prevent a lady from being evicted, this lady called in a complaint (supposibly) and within 18 hours of taking these cats the sheriffs department were on the family's porch.   (These cats were not part of Frisky Felines Foundation.  Samantha told this lady she could not take them as she was full.  When Samantha found out they were feral cats and were being shot at Samantha knew all someone had to do was take the cats to a feral colony.   Samantha was just helping cats that were being shot at and to help prevent a lady and her mother lose their home).</p>
<p>Animal control seized all the animals (including the chickens they had there for eggs) all based on a complaint from this woman that Samantha helped when she refused several times because Samantha's family was swamped with trying to get caught up on the past 10 days, but did not want to see this woman lose her home so took the cats with the intention of taking them to a feral colony the following day.  Animal control did not say ANYTHING pertaining to anything except this vague compalint.  Todd told Samantha things did not add up and that those cats were a set up.  You see, they were less than 2 months away from filing the actual lawsuit in court.  This animal control officer went further since immediate charges were not brought forth and killed 4 of the cats.  It took 4 weeks before charges were filed against samantha and Todd.  Charges of child neglect on the 19 year old and charges of animal neglect on the 4 cats that animal control killed.</p>
<p>Samantha is still fighting back but much harder.  They bailed out of jail (weren't really ""arrested"" their attorney got them a deal to lower the $10,000 bond if they turned themselves in and they did), she filed an injunction to put a stay on the animals until a hearing (which has yet to be heard) and then filed a federal lawsuit against CPS and the town marshall (that started all of this) and civil suit against animal control and the ac officier.  This is why the family is struggling to stand up for their rights as a US citizen!!!!   No family should ever have to pay out $10,000 (what they have paid in fees since Nov 17, 2011) to prove they are innocent from a situation of corruption, conspiracy, greed and retaliation.  All the proof lies within the vet bills, the flooded basement, the photos of the cats before the raid and the kdis own statements that there was nothing wrong until CPS and animal control destroyed their family.  This is small town corruption and Samantha will be fighting for new laws to protect pets, pet owners and rescues against these types of falsified seizures, raids and charges.  As well as she wanting to get new child protection laws changed to stop CPS from thinking they can do whatever they want with no proof whatsoever.</p>
<p>All of the above that this family has gone through can be proven and verified that it indeed happened.</p>
<p>Please contribute $5 to this family to get them back on their feet, to get working on better laws for the pets of America, families of America.  They are suing and if they win what they are asking for they are going to put up a legal fund for those that have been wrongly affected as they were to stand their legal ground and sue.  This reason right here is why governmental abuse is allowed to continue because there are no legal resources for people that do not have the funds to fight back to do anything to protect their given rights.  Help this family get that right and fund for you!  Contribute what you can today.  Share this campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>How would you feel if you life was fine one day and you began to see everything you worked so hard for began to slip away because of something you didn't do?  Help this family please.</p>

<p> </p></div>","This is an urgent call to help this family.
This family consists of a mom, dad and 3 children who through whatever hurdles life throws their way always put others first.  We need to put this family first for once.
The children are Josh who is 19, Candace who will be 18 on Sept 12 and Parker who will be 15 on Sept 5.  Josh has mild mental retardation and Parker has Aspergers Syndrome. On top of these childrens disabilities, their mother, Samantha,  is disabled with Reflex Sympathetic Disorder and Fibromyalgia and cannot work.  Josh just recently lost his part time job due to his disability. Candace has started looking for a job to help her family but has had no luck.   Josh and Candace are both starting their senior year in  high school. Parker is homeschooled.  Samantha and Todd (mom and dad), through peoples amazements, through all they have been through will be married 22 years on September 22, 2012.  Many people all the time tell them how so many couples would not had stuck together with the turmoil thrown infront of this family and are amazed this has not happened.  Candace as a matter of fact, just made the remark the other day to someone this very statement that through it all her family is still together.  Lets help keep it that way.  We all know how little stressors can tear a family apart, but what this family has endured is too much and each time has been no fault of their own.
This family has been financially ruined by the UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT THREE TIMES.  The stories of each one is heartbreaking for such young people.  Folks, we need to step up and help them because you would NEVER want to endure the hell these 5 people have been through.  A family that not just takes care of their own, but reaches out to others in need, runs a no kill cat shelter, donates to others, etc.  NO family or person that thinks of others and not just what their family does not have, their needs and wants should EVER have to be put through the mill by anyone let alone our goverments.  The family is about to lose their home, they have already had to file bankruptcy because of their current situation caused by retaliation by animal control for Samantha filing a tort claim (lawsuit) against animal control. Because of being sold a house fraudulantly in 1992 these kids have not had the childhood a child should have.  These parents, thinking about their children's needs moved these kids to Depauw Indiana, a small country town to start  life over, to give  these kids a second chance to be kids and low and behold if 1 lone CPS caseworker conspired with 1 lone animal control officer to ultimately DESTROY this family.  This family is struggling and not because of anything they did wrong.  That is what makes this so important, their pleas for help just get over looked.  We need to stand and help this family, let them know we do care about what they do for others.   Show these kids that there are still good people in the world.
If you can contribute ANYTHING that would be great, if not then please share this. This is a current list of what this family needs.
1) They need $1600 to get their mortgage caught up.  The house is in foreclosure which is so ironic.  Samantha on November 16, 2011 helped a lady who was going to be evicted from  her home over feral cats.  This lady ""supposibly"" called in a complaint on Samantha.  Now Samantha, her husband and their children are losing their home.  $500 will be a great start to help get some of it caught up.
2) This family needs 2 vehicles fixed, they now own 5 vehicles of which now 1 is only running, it is a 95 Ford Ranger, in which Todd drives to work and works an hour away from home.   Josh before losing his job bought a car since Samantha's van broke down and within 7 days his car broke down.  They are assuming Josh's car needs an engine so now Josh is out of a car and $2600.  As of date they have a running 95 Ford Ranger, a 95 Kia Sportage with a blown head gasket, 2 99 Dodge Grand Caravans both needing engines and Josh's car a 98 Pontiac Bonnieville that most likely also needs an engine, it will be going to the shop on Monday if they can scrape the money together. 
Samantha and todd live without financing things and pay cash for everything  to get caught up on life.  They live within their means, but life is just hammering them to death.  The harder they try to do right and do good and live like they are supposed to the more problems fall upon them.
3) The house was in the middle of being remodeled in winter of 2009 and the repairs  had to be left undone, those are 10 times worse now. The repairs are the basement, the kids bathroom and the kitchen.  The basement is a flooding mess and now retaining wall is caving in.  They need money to pay to have a backhoe to come in and remove the earth, the retaining walls  need torn out and rebuilt and new cement laid.  They are willing to do this work themselves to save money.  The basement will cost around $5000 if they do it on their own.  The kids bathroom just needs flooring so they can replace the broken commode, the commode leaks and they are not sure if they have water damage, but they need the money for the floor which is $200, the faucet for the sink is $135.  They will use existing plumbing for the claw foot tub as it will cost approximately $500 and is not urgent.  The kitchen floor needs replaced and will cost about $500.  The cabinet needs replaced and they are looking second hand for that.  The lower cabinets have water damage and are rotting.
4) The back porch is falling apart, the boards are warped.  Samantha qualifies to get this fixed but the family has been ousted by the community and the humilation is too much for Samantha to go sign up for Repair Affair.  (read further down about being outsted by the community).  The back porch is in a dangerous state especially come this winter.  They are trying to tear it down and build back something to use this winter and be able to add on to it later.  this will cost a minimum of $300 for the need, $700 for what is really needed, but they said, the urgency is something Samantha can use in winter without falling and getting hurt.  The kids as well but they are more agile than Samantha.
5) The family lives in a log cabin, it has been in the process of being stripped and stained since fall of 2009, the logs/chinking need maintanance BADLY and the worst part of it is all the chinking needs to be ripped out and replaced.  The chinking is falling off the house, has holes in it, etc.  These holes allow all sorts of things to get into the house and let air escape outside the house.  This is something easy to fix and the family can do it themselves but it will cost at least $500 to do it right. 
Why should you contribute? 
Because like I said, this is a family that puts others first.  Therefore once we make them whole again, give them support they need they are going to be in the postition to further making a difference to other people.  You may need their help someday,  you never know if you will end up like them.  They are currently in a lawsuit over what CPS/Animal Control did, if they win they are going to set up a fund to help others protect their children and their pets.   Imagine if we don't help them now their lawsuit may end.  If we can help them, and this helps this particular lawsuit, they are going to be lobbying for new laws pertaining to pet owners and children.  We need more people willing to take a stand for others and these people are willing to do at their expense.  It is this reason why you need to contribute.  Please make your contribution, $5 is a great contribution.
What happens if we don't raise the money needed? 
The money is still needed regardless if we do not raise enough to cover all their needs.  Just helping with $40 a month will help cover their water bill and they can use that money on wood to build a safer back porch for Samantha and the children.  Any amount you contribute is going to impact this family.  When you struggle, $5 extra is a big difference.  I will also keep you up to date with photos of where your money is going.  There are photos of all their vehicles, 2 videos of Josh's car and Samantha's van to prove they need engines.  I will post the estimate as soon as I get it.  Photos of the house are posted as well as videos.  As the money is given to them via paypal they can make immediate repairs and I will post the photos.  You can see yourself the need, the repairs and how this will change this family's life.  We need to help a family that is not greedy and has a heart of gold and feels everyone should help one another.
You want to help but you are struggling yourself?
Alot of us are. All you need to do is post this story everyday for 1 hour all over the internet.  Help get it to someone that can make a contribution.  Sharing this is just as important as making a contribution.  Can you spare just 1 hour a day to get the word out?  That costs nothing out of your pocket and imagine  how many people you can get this to.  Share it on news  reports, on line news papers, facebook, twitter, digg, etc.  You get the idea.
Surely by now you can see the importance of helping this family. 
I haven't even written the entire list of the help this family needs, I have just pointed out the urgent parts.  Can you see the need? Can you imagine what this family can do to help others if they were whole again?   Then please, contribute as little as you can.  It all adds up.  Can you imagine if we got 100,000 people  to donate just $1 how much better this family will be?  And how much this family can continue helping others?  Can you imagine yourself in their shoes in such dire need from being blind sided and destroyed because you chose to stand up for your childrens rights, your constitutional rights?  But yet this family still helps other people while fighting all this.  Most people would had turned their backs on society, but good hearted people like this family don't.  They try to see good in all humans. Please make your contribution today and please share this family's story.
How does this family's struggle currently impact you or those around them?
This family runs a no kill cat shelter and out of retaliation (from the lawsuit) they were raided.  All the animals were taken, charges of abuse were filed when in fact the accussers are the abusers.  Animal control killed 4 of their cats to get charges pressed.  All allegations of abuse are lies and can be proved they are lies.  Due to legality reasons I cannot post everything I know of the evidence against the prosecution, but it is something most people would not be able to handle.  Right now while the parents are fighting these trumped up charges their pets lives sit in limbo.  They need $800 to give to the animals attorney to get their pets home and the shelter will be up and running again.  Their children have begged Samantha to not give up this fight, they will wait as long as they  have to but do not give up their animals or the shelter.  The kids loved working in the shelter and loved helping animals and people. They also  loved having fundraiser parties.  All that is (temporarily) gone but the fact it is gone has impacted MANY, MANY families and cats needing their services.  They still get calls and emails monthly asking for help and they have to turn them down because their lives are in limbo.  Imagine how many cats have died because they can't help, imagine how many families had to give up their cats because the shelters Permenancy Program isn't in operation.  The Permenancy Program is for those facing foreclosure, eviction, deployment, fires, etc that have no where for their cat but do not want to rehome them.  This program gives them a place until the family can take them home.  That to me is a major impact in Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois and Ohio their shelter needs to be up and running.  Make your contribution today, get this family back on their feet so they can continue doing what they enjoy....helping others.
Thank you.
 
Here is the story about how the government has destroyed this family.
First time the government struck July 31, 1992............
Samantha and Todd (the parents) got married 9/22/90 and Samantha wanted to have a family and wanted to move to a family house before having kids, so they sought out and found the house of their dreams in January 1992.  Samantha's mother was put in the hospital in May 1992 and died July 1992, this was while Samantha was 5 months pregnant with Josh.  Samantha had a very  difficult time with her mothers death and they were having trouble with getting the dream home and fought very hard to get it.  When things were starting to dwindel down for them they decided with all the stress, being pregnant, etc that right then just was not a good time to purchase this particular  house.  Samantha and Todd was backing out.  The seller of the house threatened to sue them if they did.  Feeling uneasy about the whole deal they went ahead and went through with the purchase.
Samantha and Randell shortly after moving into the house realized this house no way could had been sold via FHA although they had an FHA loan.
January 1995 Candace was hospitalized with severe pneumonia caused by black mold. She was in a coma for 2 days.  She then had pediatric asthma and seizures.  She outgrew both of those and threw school learned she was mentally delayed, she was 18 months behind her peers.  Candace still struggles but works very hard to get good grades, she hates school but refuses to miss a day, she has worked very hard to get where she is right now and her parents are so proud of her.
There is alot more to this story but for those that don't want to read the whole story I am complining it and the newspaper clippings into a website.  Give me time to get that prepared. Keep checking back.
 
Second time the government struck December 2009, January 13, 2010 and Febuary 2010
Decemember 15, 2009 CPS was called to the house.  The allegations were unsubstantiated on December 21, 2009
January 13, 2010 really begain on January 6, 2010.  After unsubstantiating the allegations the caseworker decided she wasn't done.  This is a very long part of this and I will give you the link to read it.  But the short of it is this.  Samantha and Todd refused on 5 different days to allowing this same caseworker to open a case on them.  So after collecting information about the no kill cat shelter and the last time of asking the family to allow her to open a case, even telling them she could get them a grant to remodel their home, she went back to her boss and told them that Samantha and Todd were cat hoarders.  With that she got her open case.  CPS has not and refuses to turn over the photos to prove their innocence to Samantha or any of the attorney's that have been on the cases since 2010!!  The description of the house and the photos do not match!  The children were detained without a warrant and no detention hearing was ever held.  Many things that violated this family's rights.  As a matter of fact.  The case was dismissed by CPS because they proved by VET BILLS they were not cat hoarders.
 
February 1, 2010 Animal Control killed all 15 cats that he illegally seized.  He stated in a court of law that he did this ""because Samantha never came back for them"".  This was 18 days after he stole these cats from this family.  (I used the terms illegal and stole because the animal control officer lied to a judge to get a search and seizure warrant, that can be verified by the probable cause affidavit and 1 photo and 1 statement.)
 
I will post this too, this is about CPS conspiring with animal control because the Lee's refused to agree to the caseworker opening a case on them.
This story is listed on the Frisky Felines Foundation website and also on ratemycaseworker.com.  I will post the info soon.
Third time the goverment struck November 17, 2011...........
Samantha filed a tort claim on animal control over the 2010 incident.  A tort claim is your first step to suing the government in state court.  In November Samantha was set up to take some cats to prevent a lady from being evicted, this lady called in a complaint (supposibly) and within 18 hours of taking these cats the sheriffs department were on the family's porch.   (These cats were not part of Frisky Felines Foundation.  Samantha told this lady she could not take them as she was full.  When Samantha found out they were feral cats and were being shot at Samantha knew all someone had to do was take the cats to a feral colony.   Samantha was just helping cats that were being shot at and to help prevent a lady and her mother lose their home).

Samantha is still fighting back but much harder.  They bailed out of jail (weren't really ""arrested"" their attorney got them a deal to lower the $10,000 bond if they turned themselves in and they did), she filed an injunction to put a stay on the animals until a hearing (which has yet to be heard) and then filed a federal lawsuit against CPS and the town marshall (that started all of this) and civil suit against animal control and the ac officier.  This is why the family is struggling to stand up for their rights as a US citizen!!!!   No family should ever have to pay out $10,000 (what they have paid in fees since Nov 17, 2011) to prove they are innocent from a situation of corruption, conspiracy, greed and retaliation.  All the proof lies within the vet bills, the flooded basement, the photos of the cats before the raid and the kdis own statements that there was nothing wrong until CPS and animal control destroyed their family.  This is small town corruption and Samantha will be fighting for new laws to protect pets, pet owners and rescues against these types of falsified seizures, raids and charges.  As well as she wanting to get new child protection laws changed to stop CPS from thinking they can do whatever they want with no proof whatsoever.
All of the above that this family has gone through can be proven and verified that it indeed happened.
Please contribute $5 to this family to get them back on their feet, to get working on better laws for the pets of America, families of America.  They are suing and if they win what they are asking for they are going to put up a legal fund for those that have been wrongly affected as they were to stand their legal ground and sue.  This reason right here is why governmental abuse is allowed to continue because there are no legal resources for people that do not have the funds to fight back to do anything to protect their given rights.  Help this family get that right and fund for you!  Contribute what you can today.  Share this campaign.

This has left me working endless hours for the last three years for a ""miracle"" on a Project of Love - something I very much believe in...  and while helping myself ""save my home"", will help many, many people across the nation through new jobs, better health &amp; wellness and new community businesses.</div>

<div>In the divorce, my ex managed to remove me from our joint checking account and sold all farm / livestock assets that we had jointly (over $300,000 equity), leaving me to struggle to try to start over again.  All the money we had earned while together had went back into the farm and this also included money from a head-on collission I had endured and received a minimal settlement.  It is very difficult to start a new business when you fight every month to just pay bills.  On top of that, since I do not have the ""means"" to fight my ex in court, he's managed to convince child support recovery that he only makes $200 per week; therefore reducing child support to $70 per month for my two youngest boys.  He owns his own business, farms with his brother and father but because he farms, he's able to hide his income when filing taxes.  Hard some days to deal with when I ""try so hard"" and I can see him on Facebook buying new tractors, semi's etc.</div>

<h3>Our Story</h3>Sustainable Hudson Valley hatched the 10% Challenge to help communities save energy and improve their local environments through people-powered creativity.  It's a simple invitation:<br/><p><br/></p>
<p>Cut your community's energy use 10%.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>And get 10% of your people involved.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The energy cuts can be any combination of municipal, business and residential, totaling 10% of electricity and heating fuel used in your community.  This can be achieved by ""picking the low hanging fruit"" such as home energy upgrades, and also by signature projects in the community such as creating bike-friendly streets.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Your household can participate by any combination of lifestyle changes and home improvements:  for instance,  by insulating your home, getting out of your car and onto your bike, or changing the way you use your appliances. People can step forward as demonstration households, or community advocates, or  volunteers helping a local campaign to progress.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We piloted this initiative in Red Hook, NY, a delightful town with two villages in its boundaries.  Over the year, we got the town supervisor to do a Lunch and Learn, the schools to run a contest for energy saving ideas, the Chamber of Commerce to invite business members in, and over 300 households to sign up and save.  The library bought a ""Kill-a-Watt Meter"" so that households can measure their electricity use.  The community launched the campaign with 10 different events from a foot race to a composting workshop. (The photo above is town board member Harry Colgan turning on the lights with bike power.)  We don't yet know the results in direct energy saving, but thanks to the Cost and Rate department at Central Hudson, our friendly utility, we will soon learn.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the campaign has been taken up by a total of 14 communities representing over 100,000 people!  <br/>They are competing for prizes donated by generous sponsors:  a solar thermal system from EarthKind Energy, a sail on the famous Sloop Clearwater for school children of the winning community; a day of R &amp; R at the Omega Institute for the hard-working winning town board; and a communitywide solar opportunity assessment from The Solar Energy Consortium, an important local organization helping to pave the way for a solar future.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We are so excited.  But we have a problem.  This effort caught on faster than our fundraising could keep up!  We need to help them buy some basic tools - like kits of energy saving light bulbs and low-flow showerheads to give away, and lawn signs for participating households.  And we need to give the campaign as a whole some TLC - publicity, technical assistance, moral support.  To do this, we are raising support to hire an Americorps member.  This Indiegogo campaign will provide the needed funding to bolster our fall application and the program's January start date.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>How we use energy profoundly affects the earth's climate, as well as the cash that flows through our communities.  Saving energy is an act of both environmental and economic stewardship. Unfortunately, many people don't get excited about it.  This campaign gets people excited.  At the beginning, I received a letter from a state agency official. It was almost angry in tone.  He was afraid I was setting too high a goal (and he may have been right).  He said, ""You are going to set communities up for disappointment.""  To this I say no:  We are going to set communities up for adventure and creativity, and a greater investment in their shared future.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>At Sustainable Hudson Valley, we are very frugal and careful not to waste paper... signs... and stuff.  But a campaign needs a few materials:  lawn signs for participating households, banners for in front of town halls (made out of eco-friendly materials, of course).  We want to make it easy to participate by offering free goody bags with low-flow shower heads and compact flourescent light bulbs, which we can buy at cost thanks to a business sponsor, Energy Management Solutions.  We also want to make sure that the local campaigns are supported for success. Our way to do this is by bringing in a member of Americorps, a blue-ribbon program helping recent college graduates to engage in meaningful service and have their expenses covered. <br/><br/>We are asking the Indigogo community to help us raise $10,000 to put a solid foundation under this exciting campaign.  Everyone who contributes will be part of building a model that is not just useful in the Hudson Valley, but in every community across America and beyond.   With this campaign, we are discovering how to wake up communities and generate sustained, positive commitment toward a low-carbon future with high quality of life for all.   <br/><br/>All contributors will have the option of being acknowledged on Sustainable Hudson Valley's website, with space for your comments about ways to get communities involved in saving energy.  <br/><br/>Contributors of $100 will receive their choice of books:  <br/><br/>Glenn Croston's 75 Green Businesses You Can Start to Make Money Now<br/><br/>Harvey Stone's Melting Down (a climate change thriller - really!)<br/><br/>Melissa Everett's Making a Living While Making a Difference.  <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you live in the Hudson Valley, please help spread the word.  If you work with a business that can benefit from visibility to these green communities, please consider sponsoring the 10% Challenge.  If you are a person of means, we'd love to be able to offer a cash prize to the first community to achieve that 10% reduction...  And wherever you are, feel free to touch base and we'll share the elements of a 10% Challenge campaign for your community.</p>
