HUT is currently just a group of dedicated fitness practitioners, but is working on both a for profit side of HUT to help support the current non-profit HUT model. HUT is currently working on becoming a non-profit 501c3. The initial purpose of the group was to get people moving and active, but over the past two years with the expansion of the HUT, we have seen good intentions become a movement of active change! HUT currently runs 14 sessions a week all free of charge. At HUT our only currency is your effort, sweat, and determination. At this point we have hosted over 300 session and are only adding more, completely free of charge. We do what we do because we love what we do. We love the our community.

</p><p><b>Lily’s Story</b></p>
<p>Hi everyone! Thank you for taking
the time to read our campaign! I’m a little rat terrier with a powerful and
well-trained nose! I’m so happy that I was rescued by Bed Bug Detection
Services since my past life was at a local shelter which wasn’t fun for me. I
can only work 6 hours a day so I can’t wait till we rescue more dog just like
me to join us! I went to school at the Florida Canine Academy and I am a
certified bed bug detection dog! Now, I’m in my forever home, have a great time
with my continuing training, and have a fabulous time sniffing out bed bugs to
help people! Because who wants to be bitten by bed bugs, right? Being a part of
BBDS is perfect for me, and I know other dogs would love to have the same
opportunities that I had! Please help us rescue other dogs to join our team! </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/300712/files/20140110063239-new_life.jpg?1389364359"" src="""" style=""width: 592.5px; height: 1057px;""/></p><p></p>
<p><b>Why we rescue dogs…</b></p>
<p>“A dog is not a thing. A thing is
replaceable. A dog is not. A thing is disposable. A dog is not. A thing doesn’t
have a heart. A dog’s heart is bigger than any ’thing’ you can ever own.” -Elizabeth
Parker.  </p>
<p>The Humane Society of the United
States estimates that more than 6-8 million dogs are cared for in shelters
every year in our country. Of those 6-8 million, approximately 3-4 million are
euthanized. These numbers are overwhelming and heart breaking. Here at Bed Bug Detection
Services, we are dedicated to rescue all of the dogs we use to detect bed bugs.
We not only save them from the possibility of euthanasia, but we provide them
with a loving, safe home and a fulfilling life that they all so greatly deserve.

<p><b>The Funding…</b></p>
<p>We are asking for funding so we
can rescue as many dogs as we can to join Lily in the fight against bed bugs.
Our dogs only work a maximum of 6 hours a day so to keep up with the needs of
our community, we need to rescue more dogs. The funds would be distributed for
expenses such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Full-time handler (each new rescue dog requires
his/her own handler)</p></li>
<li><p>A vehicle with ice cold air, a necessity in
Florida</p></li>
<li><p>A comfortable place to sleep</p></li>
<li><p>Marketing 
</p></li>
<li><p>Office space </p></li>
</ul><p><b>The Impact…</b></p>
<p>“Saving one dog will not change
the world, but surely for that one dog, the world will change forever.” -Karen
Davison.  </p>
<p>Bed Bug Detection Services wants
to do just that: change the world for as
many dogs as we can. With your donation, we can rescue a dog and give them the
fulfilled life they deserve.  There are
so many breeds that get such joy out of working and making their owners happy
that we not only will be saving a life, but we will be providing that dog with
a very fulfilling existence while protecting our community, hospitals, nursing
homes, assisted living facilities and more.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/300706/files/20140110062628-aww.jpg?1389363988"" src="""" style=""width: 568.04px; height: 757px;""/></p><p></p>
<p><b>Who is Bed Bug Detection Services?</b></p>
<p>Bed Bug Detection Services uses
canines to sniff out bed bugs and keep your home, business and facility safe!
We are very passionate about making sure that our community feels and is safe
from these little blood suckers! All of our dog handlers are certified through
the Florida Canine Academy, as well as all of our dogs. We also follow the
guidelines and protocols set in place by AHCA and keep health care facilities
in compliance to avoid any unnecessary issues.

<p><b>Understanding bedbugs and our detection canines…</b></p>
<p>Bed bugs hide during most of the
day. Their preferred hiding spot is in tiny crevices and cracks – dark places
where you don’t see them. Then at night, they come out to feed primarily on
humans but also on our pets! Often, you don’t realize you have bed bugs until
the area has been overwhelmingly infested with them.</p>
<p>Our detection dogs are always on
the hunt based on scent, so it doesn’t matter if the bed bugs are in hiding.
The dog is trained to detect live bed bugs and viable eggs. The added benefit
is that after an area is treated for bed bugs, the dogs can come back into an
area and confirm it worked!</p>
<p>Dogs trained to locate bed bugs
typically have a 97% accuracy rate. Compared with humans who average 30-40%
accuracy, the detection dog is the way to go. The dog’s ability to locate as
few as one bed bug in a hotel room gives you the valuable tool of early
detection before bed bugs become a massive and invasive problem.</p>
<p><b>Other ways you can help…</b></p>
<p>We understand that not everyone
can support us financially, so if you are able, please help us spread the word
about Lily and Bed Bug Detection Services and our want to rescue another dog by
sharing this with everyone you know.</p><p></p><p></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p>

</p>
<p>Warriors Without Weapons is an
intensive, 32-day, experiential international training
program, providing participants with the tools needed to transform
lives anywhere in the world. The program is run by <a href=""http://institutoelos.org/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Instituto Elos</span></a>,
and consists of a 7-step methodology that is applied to three different
communities in Baixada Santista, Santos, São Paulo, Brazil.</p>
<p>These communities are faced
with daily struggles and social injustices. The participants of the program, 60 'warriors' from over 15 different countries worldwide, work with
the people in the communities and in one month, actively change their lives.
They bring them together, encourage them to share their dreams of the
community, and create plans of how to materialize these dreams. Resources are
then found from within the community (through upcycling, recycling, reusing),
and everyone together starts building those dreams: garbage is turned into playgrounds, and
debris into community buildings.</p>

happen in communities that are in desperate need of change. And change can be
real for them: all they need is 60 enthusiastic foreigners from every corner of
the world telling them that they can
do it. 
I want to learn how to encourage people to
take ownership of their lives, and create real,
positive change. Bringing that methodology back to my country at a
time when it needs it the most is an invaluable asset, both for the Greek communities and me personally.  What do you get?First of all, my uttermost gratitude - your generosity is helping fulfill not only the dreams of 3 Brazilian communities, but also that of a young Greek dreamer, out to make the world a better place! But other than my gratitude, I also created a lot of fun and interesting perks for you! THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart - I am truly grateful to share my journey with all of you.I can't do it without your support!Whether or not I will go, depends on you! This campaign runs on fixed funding, which means all of the contributions will be refunded if I don't reach my target by the day after Christmas!There are other ways you can help:If you believe in this cause as much as I do, please share my campaign page link with people who will be interested in supporting it! Think about the optimists, dreamers, and doers in your life, and let them know about this campaign!THANK YOU! OBRIGADA!! ΕΥΧΑΡΙΣΤΩ!!!",0.0,3,"3 Campaigns

<div>Laura thought she knew him, they had been friends for years. When the romance hit she wasn't even surprised. Sure, sell her house, move away from her family - of course she loved him and they were happy. </div>
<div>Shortly after giving birth to Jimmy the abuse began. First it was shouting outbursts, and throwing objects around the house. Then it escalated to throwing objects at her, and physically beating her. The police were called numerous times, but laws in the area along with some cliche good ole boy mentality meant take him out of the house to cool off and no jail time. Some of the deputies offered assistance but in the area they were in options were limited at best.</div>
<div>The night he tried to choke her to death was the first time the police actually threatened him with jail. From then on he was out of the house, unfortunately the law in the south is allowing him to keep his son in the state because his job is there and he pays support. Laura can not find steady work due to a bad economy and she and Jimmy are trapped.</div>
<div>He is now losing his job and the courts have said that once that tie is broken she can leave the state. She is hoping to return home but has a small window to pack up meager belongings, make the trip, and then once she gets home find work and a home for them. In the time she lived out of state her parents have passed but she has friends and family here and we need to get her home. </div>
<div>Please, will you help us bring Laura and Jimmy home?</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are hoping to raise $15,000 to cover costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pay out of current lease</li>
<li>Repair vehicle to make long drive</li>
<li>Rent trailer for belongings</li>
<li>Travel (gas, tolls, motel stays)</li>
<li>Pay legal fees/court costs</li>
<li>Pay deposit and 1st month rent once home</li>
<li>Have at least a three month cushion for bills so Laura can find work as she will not be getting child support any longer</li> </ul>
<div>If the entire goal is not reached all funds collected will still go toward getting Laura home as cheaply as possible. Obviously if we don't raise the full amount there won't be a cushion, but we need to get as much as possible so we can bring a mother and her child home to family and friends. </div>
<div>Of course we are all also donating, but the more people who can help, the more likely we are to succeed.  Even a donation of $5 can help Laura and Jimmy get home to us.</div>
<div>What is in it for you? Well, some say Karma (the good kind), some say a sense of doing a good thing, others say its doing a charitable deed. All we know is you will be in our thoughts and prayers for a lifetime. </div>

<b>THE PURPOSE OF COMMUNITY SUPPORTED EDUCATION: REGENERATIVE COMMUNITY DESIGN &amp; CULTURE REPAIR</b><br/>
</h3>
<p>The purpose of this Regenerative Community Design is for the community to aggregate $10,835 to send Chico community-educator, Katrina Djberof, to study Transformative Eco-Social Leadership at a leadership school called Weaving Earth Center for Relational Education.</p><p><b>Regenerative Community Design</b> is a Community Supported Education fundraiser to send me to be trained in a mentoring model that looks at power from a totally different standpoint and is based on relational education and ecopsychology. It is a design model that uses deep nature connection to bring people together in a positive way, which does culture repair . . . It's a design model that heals by bringing us consciously into greater connection to Earth, self and others.<br/></p><p>Weaving Earth is an outdoor leadership school that
provides hands-on “experiential learning” based on the 8 Shields Mentoring Model. I am seeking an alternative framework of authority and model to the current standardized management systems and its disciplinary structures developed for the corporate and institutional level. The ""power-over"" hierarchy and fear-based psychology which are backed by punishment for insubordination (HR language and law) do not work in collaborative projects or group dynamics. I want to study a model based on mentoring and empowerment that draws out people's genius and incorporate it into the community education and community building I do at the grassroots level, and nonprofit and for-profit sectors.</p><p>After finding Weaving Earth I knew it was exactly what I was looking for and started making headlines in a new cooperatively owned online journal, <i>The Left Coast Independent</i>, ""<a href=""http://www.theleftcoastindependent.com/story/2014/07/30/leading-edge/inner-tracking/102.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Inner Tracking</a>.<i>""</i></p><blockquote><i>""Every now and then people who have made civic contributions on our behalf (volunteering, organizing, or otherwise saving the world) step up and challenge themselves. Katrina is one such person. She's raising funds to attend a year-long course on mentoring. Katrina will make our society better. She's moving into what is called social entrepreneurship. That's when people see needs in society and fill them. Corporations don't see any profit in small enterprises and government can't organize well enough to meet needs. We need more folks stepping in to help. More social entrepreneurs. Like Katrina."" - Dr. Vernon Lee Andrews</i></blockquote><p></p><p><b>PERKS:</b></p><p><b>Built-In Donor Perks: Bringing People Together In A Really Positive Way</b></p><p>Any person, organization or business who donates to my fundraiser will be invited to attend a <i>monthly potluck and discussion group</i>. Donors will have an opportunity to learn about the training and contribute to weaving nature connection in our regional community. This container will allow everyone to share their skills, experiences and contribute to the conversation, as well as integrating our discussions into one's life. </p><p><i>*Donors, I have your email address (thanks for contributing!) and will be in touch as this is developed and set into motion.

<p></p>
<p><i>""Buddhist philosopher and environmental leader Joanna Macy has described these two trends as “the great unraveling,” in which our environment, social structures, and species are collapsing under the weight of current stresses; and “the great turning,” in which new understandings are unfolding for how humankind can—and must—live in harmony with itself and the planet."" </i></p>
<p><i>""The impacts of the ecological unraveling are well defined: Rising global temperatures, melting of the polar ice, extreme weather, ocean acidification, rising sea level, freshwater shortages, and many other alarming trends. Similarly, the main immediate causes are known: rampant use of fossil fuels and deforestation, with other contributing factors mixed in. These forces are creating a complex matrix of social, political, cultural and ecological instabilities that place increasing stress on our selves, families, communities and societies"" (Scott, W. &amp; Edmondson 2014).</i><br/></p>
<p>Transformative eco-social leadership and Weaving Earth are answering my prayers and speaking to my greatest needs . . . and the greatest needs of the world today. All monies aggregated in the community supported education fundraiser will be received whether the goal is reached or not. <span style=""line-height: 30px;"">Thank you so much for helping me to make this dream a reality and for supporting me to step more wholly into my potential! </span></p>

<h3>
<b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">WHY IS THIS SO IMPORTANT TO ME?</b><br/>
</h3>
<div>
<p>
</p>
<p><i><i><b>My deepest yearning is to learn a leadership style that looks at the group it’s facilitating like an organism and to obtain credentials to legitimize the work I do.</b></i></i></p>
<p><i>""We are not preparing people for the world we grew up
in, nor are we preparing them for today's world. Instead, we must empower them
with the creativity needed to solve problems that we cannot
imagine."" - Matt Kolan &amp; Walter Poleman, University of Vermont.</i></p>
<p>When people ask what I do, I usually
answer, ""I'm a Synergy Specialist and Integrator."" I’m like Spider
weaving a web of connection, solving problems and working with dynamic groups of
people.</p>
<p>In co-creating and co-managing
operating and human systems, I feel a strong need for the language, skills and
training to cultivate a fabric of culture that is flexible, fluid, bountiful
and resilient as a forest floor.  This is
rooted in an intention of connection and empowerment.  Weaving Earth calls
this Cultural Biomimicy. </p>
<p><b><i>Obstacles to Deconstruct &amp; Re-Create: Power, Authority and Discipline in Group Dynamics . . . This is what I'm up to.</i></b></p>
<p>In my experience, working with diverse
groups and teams, I can no longer use standardized management systems and its disciplinary measures developed for the corporate and institutional level, governed by an HR policy that uses legal terms like insubordination. </p>
<p>Why? It tears apart relationships. It
is an oppressive, power-over approach based on fear and punishment. I’ve seen it over and over
again. I can't guide a team or a business that is disconnected. If people are
always getting punished or are in fear of making a mistake and then getting written
up or getting fired, that negatively affects behavior and thus breaks a
team apart. </p>
<p>My bosses aren’t even on board with it! They refuse to even use this
language, which means I can’t use this language.</p>
<p>I’ve looked at various leadership styles,
spoke with leaders I’m inspired by to seek a better understanding of this complex
problem. There’s something <i>way</i> bigger going on here that isn’t working, and
it’s hard to find a language for. There has to be another way! And there is.</p>
<p><b><i>The question I’ve been asking myself
is: What do I put in its place and how?</i></b></p>
<p>After much research, I’ve found the
training Weaving Earth offers through its 3-year Immersion Program as a powerful
basket of tools, techniques and technologies. And it’s exactly what I’m looking
for!</p>
<p>The world is yearning for
something different to emerge that supports the whole. I want to meet this need
in conjunction with others collaborating on this shared effort. </p>

<p></p>
<p>You're over half-way through and
you’re doing awesome! </p>
<p>In total, this fundraiser is aiming
to aggregate at least $10,835 within a 39 day window. School starts September
3, 2014! Your donations to my Regenerative
Community Design campaign are truly gifts!</p>
<p><b>Where does all the money go?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>$8500: School (9 months of training)<br/>
</li>
<li>$880: Meals on-site (5 meals per week for 9 months is $7/meal)</li>
<li>$1023: +/- 11% fees associated with this campaign  (7% fee for money going to a nonprofit, GRUB Education, and 3-5% fee to process credit cards)</li>
<li>$512: Gas: 4 trips/mo from Chico to Penngrove, CA (1352 miles/mo) for 9 months</li>
</ul>
<p>I will turn around and invest everything I learn
back into the community. You are really investing in yourself and our shared
future! Could anything be sweeter?</p>
<p>I will receive <i>all</i> your generous donations, minus the aforementioned fees whether I surpass the goal or am shy of reaching it. Some fundraising platforms require the financial goal to be reached in order
for the campaign to be a success. However, I’ve selected a platform that will be
a success no matter how much money is raised! </p>
<p>It’s a win-win-win!!!</p>
<p><i>*I am not offering perks in this fundraiser as I've already paid it forward with the work I do in the community. Your donations are an investment into the community, as I will continue to partner with nonprofit and for-profit organizations and institutions to raise awareness through experiential education on agro-food systems, resource management and ecology. I'm offering a more holistic and integrated lens for cooperative and collaborative relationships to: self, the soil that feeds our food; our communities and families; the work place and to our ecosystems . . . on the basis of design and relational leadership, which is transformative.</i></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>THE FEELING BEHIND OUR GIFTS: THE GOOD WAY</h3>
<p>It<i> feels </i>really good to
ask the community to invest in me. This is community-supported education for a community-educator. I
will bring it all back and integrate it into the work I'm currently doing for
the community, as well as share and mentor it in all aspects of my life. It's my commitment and my soul's deepest longing.</p>
<p>Allow me to invite you to make a
gift that <i>feels</i> good to you. Intentions are powerful. I want it to feel
good. No gift is too big or too small, and my intentions are to help transform
our world with your help.</p>
<blockquote>""Last week we supported Katrina in her fundraising efforts to attend Weaving Earth for an education in Regenerative Community Design. We have worked with her for the last year to plan the 6 part Chico Seed Saving Series and were impressed on many levels. Adjectives that come to mind are flexible yet professional, directed and creative, hands-on and happy. This educational opportunity will enhance these qualities and then some. And the best part? Katrina wants to bring it all home to Chico! Follow this link to learn more. Let's send Katrina back to school!"" - Kalan Redwood, regional seed breeder at Redwood Seeds</blockquote>

<h3>HOW WILL YOUR GIFTS IMPACT OUR WORLD?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>My project is part of a movement
that is gaining much momentum across the world, which demonstrates its worth
and value cross-culturally. The impacts you make when investing in this work
are potent! You are investing in healing our world, cultivating a culture of
mentoring with role models where people are empowered to embody their greatest
genius to do their soul's work. <br/></p>
<p>You are bringing a model to the
North Valley that is ergonomically designed for how humans are designed psychologically and biologically -  how our brains work (how we
learn); how we are an integral part of our ecosystem; and how it cultivates a
culture of connection. Jon Young's anthropological research and life's work
reveals - or reintroduces the fundamental structures necessary for an
integrated and healthy culture which fosters holistic human development and
empowerment. </p>
<p>The impact of your donations to my
campaign will train me in Transformative Eco-Social Leadership, to use and
implement this design model of mentoring through nature connection, and apply
it to the work I do at the grassroots level, and through the nonprofit and
for-profit sectors for the health of our communities.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Life is full of risks and
challenges. We do our best to make calculated risks and to face challenges and
work through them without destroying relationships.</p>
<p>From what I've observed in crowd funding, there seems to be a bell-curve take off where the campaign starts gaining some traction and the tendency is then a bit of a pause. Before the deadline, folks want to see these fundraisers be successful and they want to contribute so there's a big push towards the end with donations and spreading the word!</p>
<p>On the flip side, the community may not fill the kitty all the way. The goal may not be reached. It's a very real reality - and it's okay. It won't be the end of the world. I know I will have done my best, and the community will reveal the level of their support and value of community building.</p>
<p>This fundraiser ends September 3, 2014. That's also the first day of school. My intention is to put at least 50% down. If this goal is not reached, I will not start the Weaving Earth program this year. Instead, I will place the monies gifted to me for this training into a savings account until I am able to attend school.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><b><br/></b></h3>
<h3><b>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>I fully understand and empathize
with those of you who just can't contribute financially, but that doesn't mean
you can't help! Word of mouth and story telling are powerful and important ways to help. Showing your support by passing along your belief in this campaign is just as important as the actual fundraising. </p>
<p>YOU
are my cheerleaders and my publicity team!! Thanks for helping to publicize
this campaign and for believing in me and this work, and for contributing to our shared successes!!!</p>
<p>Show your support, offer testimonials and you can also help to get the word out by telling friends, family and neighbors, bosses and even strangers! </p>
<p>I am blessing your life, and feeling so
much gratitude to be here with you. Thank you for all YOU do!<span><br/></span></p>

The purpose of this Regenerative Community Design is for the community to aggregate $10,835 to send Chico community-educator, Katrina Djberof, to study Transformative Eco-Social Leadership at a leadership school called Weaving Earth Center for Relational Education.Regenerative Community Design is a Community Supported Education fundraiser to send me to be trained in a mentoring model that looks at power from a totally different standpoint and is based on relational education and ecopsychology. It is a design model that uses deep nature connection to bring people together in a positive way, which does culture repair . . . It's a design model that heals by bringing us consciously into greater connection to Earth, self and others.Weaving Earth is an outdoor leadership school that
provides hands-on “experiential learning” based on the 8 Shields Mentoring Model. I am seeking an alternative framework of authority and model to the current standardized management systems and its disciplinary structures developed for the corporate and institutional level. The ""power-over"" hierarchy and fear-based psychology which are backed by punishment for insubordination (HR language and law) do not work in collaborative projects or group dynamics. I want to study a model based on mentoring and empowerment that draws out people's genius and incorporate it into the community education and community building I do at the grassroots level, and nonprofit and for-profit sectors.After finding Weaving Earth I knew it was exactly what I was looking for and started making headlines in a new cooperatively owned online journal, The Left Coast Independent, ""Inner Tracking.""""Every now and then people who have made civic contributions on our behalf (volunteering, organizing, or otherwise saving the world) step up and challenge themselves. Katrina is one such person. She's raising funds to attend a year-long course on mentoring. Katrina will make our society better. She's moving into what is called social entrepreneurship. That's when people see needs in society and fill them. Corporations don't see any profit in small enterprises and government can't organize well enough to meet needs. We need more folks stepping in to help. More social entrepreneurs. Like Katrina."" - Dr. Vernon Lee AndrewsPERKS:Built-In Donor Perks: Bringing People Together In A Really Positive WayAny person, organization or business who donates to my fundraiser will be invited to attend a monthly potluck and discussion group.

""Buddhist philosopher and environmental leader Joanna Macy has described these two trends as “the great unraveling,” in which our environment, social structures, and species are collapsing under the weight of current stresses; and “the great turning,” in which new understandings are unfolding for how humankind can—and must—live in harmony with itself and the planet."" 
""The impacts of the ecological unraveling are well defined: Rising global temperatures, melting of the polar ice, extreme weather, ocean acidification, rising sea level, freshwater shortages, and many other alarming trends. Similarly, the main immediate causes are known: rampant use of fossil fuels and deforestation, with other contributing factors mixed in. These forces are creating a complex matrix of social, political, cultural and ecological instabilities that place increasing stress on our selves, families, communities and societies"" (Scott, W. & Edmondson 2014).
Transformative eco-social leadership and Weaving Earth are answering my prayers and speaking to my greatest needs . . . and the greatest needs of the world today. All monies aggregated in the community supported education fundraiser will be received whether the goal is reached or not. Thank you so much for helping me to make this dream a reality and for supporting me to step more wholly into my potential! 
""Help Katrina to help us!"" David Guzzetti, former Chico Councilman.


WHY IS THIS SO IMPORTANT TO ME?




My deepest yearning is to learn a leadership style that looks at the group it’s facilitating like an organism and to obtain credentials to legitimize the work I do.
""We are not preparing people for the world we grew up
in, nor are we preparing them for today's world. Instead, we must empower them
with the creativity needed to solve problems that we cannot
imagine."" - Matt Kolan & Walter Poleman, University of Vermont.
When people ask what I do, I usually
answer, ""I'm a Synergy Specialist and Integrator."" I’m like Spider
weaving a web of connection, solving problems and working with dynamic groups of
people.
In co-creating and co-managing
operating and human systems, I feel a strong need for the language, skills and
training to cultivate a fabric of culture that is flexible, fluid, bountiful
and resilient as a forest floor.  This is
rooted in an intention of connection and empowerment.  Weaving Earth calls
this Cultural Biomimicy. 
Obstacles to Deconstruct & Re-Create: Power, Authority and Discipline in Group Dynamics . . . This is what I'm up to.
In my experience, working with diverse
groups and teams, I can no longer use standardized management systems and its disciplinary measures developed for the corporate and institutional level, governed by an HR policy that uses legal terms like insubordination. 
Why? It tears apart relationships. It
is an oppressive, power-over approach based on fear and punishment. I’ve seen it over and over
again. I can't guide a team or a business that is disconnected. If people are
always getting punished or are in fear of making a mistake and then getting written
up or getting fired, that negatively affects behavior and thus breaks a
team apart. 
My bosses aren’t even on board with it! They refuse to even use this
language, which means I can’t use this language.
I’ve looked at various leadership styles,
spoke with leaders I’m inspired by to seek a better understanding of this complex
problem. There’s something way bigger going on here that isn’t working, and
it’s hard to find a language for. There has to be another way! And there is.
The question I’ve been asking myself
is: What do I put in its place and how?
After much research, I’ve found the
training Weaving Earth offers through its 3-year Immersion Program as a powerful
basket of tools, techniques and technologies. And it’s exactly what I’m looking
for!
The world is yearning for
something different to emerge that supports the whole. I want to meet this need
in conjunction with others collaborating on this shared effort.

GRATITUDE FOR YOU!!
I feel so much gratitude for your commitment to making the world a better place through the work you do in the world. I am so grateful to know so many of you value community, connection, health, and this lusciously wonderful world we share. Thank you for supporting such potent work!

WEAVING EARTH CENTER FOR RELATIONAL EDUCATION


Weaving Earth offers an immersion
program using relational education, eco-psychology and permaculture. All of
their programs are highly experiential, held in a community context,
facilitated by invested mentors and based in natural learning rhythms. This
“Relational” model of education encourages healthy development, natural
intelligence, an innate sense of belonging, individual genius and authentic
connection to self, others and earth.
To learn more about Weaving Earth visit their website. I've outlined the areas of study, and Weaving Earth's lineage on my blog. Click here to read more.



FUNDRAISING GOAL:  $10,835

You're over half-way through and
you’re doing awesome! 
In total, this fundraiser is aiming
to aggregate at least $10,835 within a 39 day window. School starts September
3, 2014! Your donations to my Regenerative
Community Design campaign are truly gifts!
Where does all the money go?

$8500: School (9 months of training)

$880: Meals on-site (5 meals per week for 9 months is $7/meal)
$1023: +/- 11% fees associated with this campaign  (7% fee for money going to a nonprofit, GRUB Education, and 3-5% fee to process credit cards)
$512: Gas: 4 trips/mo from Chico to Penngrove, CA (1352 miles/mo) for 9 months

I will turn around and invest everything I learn
back into the community. You are really investing in yourself and our shared
future! Could anything be sweeter?
I will receive all your generous donations, minus the aforementioned fees whether I surpass the goal or am shy of reaching it. Some fundraising platforms require the financial goal to be reached in order
for the campaign to be a success. However, I’ve selected a platform that will be
a success no matter how much money is raised! 
It’s a win-win-win!!!
*I am not offering perks in this fundraiser as I've already paid it forward with the work I do in the community. Your donations are an investment into the community, as I will continue to partner with nonprofit and for-profit organizations and institutions to raise awareness through experiential education on agro-food systems, resource management and ecology. I'm offering a more holistic and integrated lens for cooperative and collaborative relationships to: self, the soil that feeds our food; our communities and families; the work place and to our ecosystems . . . on the basis of design and relational leadership, which is transformative.

THE FEELING BEHIND OUR GIFTS: THE GOOD WAY
It feels really good to
ask the community to invest in me. This is community-supported education for a community-educator. I
will bring it all back and integrate it into the work I'm currently doing for
the community, as well as share and mentor it in all aspects of my life. It's my commitment and my soul's deepest longing.
Allow me to invite you to make a
gift that feels good to you. Intentions are powerful. I want it to feel
good. No gift is too big or too small, and my intentions are to help transform
our world with your help.
""Last week we supported Katrina in her fundraising efforts to attend Weaving Earth for an education in Regenerative Community Design. We have worked with her for the last year to plan the 6 part Chico Seed Saving Series and were impressed on many levels. Adjectives that come to mind are flexible yet professional, directed and creative, hands-on and happy. This educational opportunity will enhance these qualities and then some. And the best part? Katrina wants to bring it all home to Chico! Follow this link to learn more. Let's send Katrina back to school!"" - Kalan Redwood, regional seed breeder at Redwood Seeds




HOW WILL YOUR GIFTS IMPACT OUR WORLD?

My project is part of a movement
that is gaining much momentum across the world, which demonstrates its worth
and value cross-culturally. The impacts you make when investing in this work
are potent! You are investing in healing our world, cultivating a culture of
mentoring with role models where people are empowered to embody their greatest
genius to do their soul's work. 
You are bringing a model to the
North Valley that is ergonomically designed for how humans are designed psychologically and biologically -  how our brains work (how we
learn); how we are an integral part of our ecosystem; and how it cultivates a
culture of connection. Jon Young's anthropological research and life's work
reveals - or reintroduces the fundamental structures necessary for an
integrated and healthy culture which fosters holistic human development and
empowerment. 
The impact of your donations to my
campaign will train me in Transformative Eco-Social Leadership, to use and
implement this design model of mentoring through nature connection, and apply
it to the work I do at the grassroots level, and through the nonprofit and
for-profit sectors for the health of our communities.




RISKS & CHALLENGES

Life is full of risks and
challenges. We do our best to make calculated risks and to face challenges and
work through them without destroying relationships.
From what I've observed in crowd funding, there seems to be a bell-curve take off where the campaign starts gaining some traction and the tendency is then a bit of a pause. Before the deadline, folks want to see these fundraisers be successful and they want to contribute so there's a big push towards the end with donations and spreading the word!
On the flip side, the community may not fill the kitty all the way. The goal may not be reached. It's a very real reality - and it's okay. It won't be the end of the world. I know I will have done my best, and the community will reveal the level of their support and value of community building.
This fundraiser ends September 3, 2014. That's also the first day of school. My intention is to put at least 50% down. If this goal is not reached, I will not start the Weaving Earth program this year. Instead, I will place the monies gifted to me for this training into a savings account until I am able to attend school.


OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP

I fully understand and empathize
with those of you who just can't contribute financially, but that doesn't mean
you can't help! Word of mouth and story telling are powerful and important ways to help. Showing your support by passing along your belief in this campaign is just as important as the actual fundraising. 
YOU
are my cheerleaders and my publicity team!! Thanks for helping to publicize
this campaign and for believing in me and this work, and for contributing to our shared successes!!!
Show your support, offer testimonials and you can also help to get the word out by telling friends, family and neighbors, bosses and even strangers! 
I am blessing your life, and feeling so
much gratitude to be here with you. Thank you for all YOU do!

With much delight,

OUR STORY 

Scott Roughgarden, Christiana Gifford, and Laurie C. Sutton all share a passion for quality wine and a growing concern for the decreasing population of the Honeybee. 
Honey Bubbles Wine is an elegant sparkling Moscato blend sourced from New Mexico. Our team has unanimously chosen to give a portion of proceeds to fight Colony Collapse Disorder of the Honeybee. 
We recognize that without the Honeybee there wouldn't be wine at all. Our goal is to bring awareness to Colony Collapse Disorder and to combat this travesty.

COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER (CCD) / BEE RESPONSIBLE

Honeybees are vital to our ecosystem pollinating at least one-third of the American diet including berries, peaches, cherries, nuts, citrus fruits, avocados, cotton, and of course grapes for eating and making wine! The stability of our nation's food supply is facing a terrible threat with conditions such as Colony Collapse Disorder (CCD) resulting in the abrupt disappearance and death of our bee population.   After WWII, there were 5 million honeybee colonies; Today, only half of that number survives with colonies dwindling at an alarmingly increasing rate every year. 
We have partnered up with a non-profit bee conservation organization called Honey Love.  We plan to donate 50 cents per every bottle sold to Honey Love and other similar organizations that help spread awareness about CCD. These organizations aid  in teaching optimal practices for urban beekeeping allowing individuals to take the fight against CCD into their own hands!

<h3>A bit about us</h3>
<p>Hi! We are Arianna and Giuliano (Aris &amp; G) and just this February we moved back from Italy to G's hometown of Norwich. We had had enough of the lifestyle we had in Rome which is less idyllic than you would imagine so we decided to go on an adventure and head off to Norwich to see what we could make of ourselves.</p>
<p>I, G, have always worked face-to-face with people, in one way or another. My first ever real job was in the Auditorium, in Rome, where I was trained and worked as a Barista. In the mean time I did one-to-one English tuition and moved on to several different jobs in order to find out what I liked the most. As it turns out, making coffee was the one. If you're really that curious about what I've done since I started working, read my C.V. here</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ary625s06ynk4xo/AAC1mSGPLhBxRYRzZ74ysL5Ka?dl=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ary625s06ynk4xo/AAC1mSGPLhBxRYRzZ74ysL5Ka?dl=0</a></p>
<p>Aris and I met in Rome just over a year and a half ago and have not left each others side since. We are in complete harmony and share the same view on (nearly) everything. </p>
<p>Having continued her studies (in Business &amp; Economics) longer than myself, this is actually Aris's first job but she has taken to it like a fish to water. She grasped in a few months what, admittedly, took me considerably longer to learn and works with a drive and passion that I have rarely come across in my 11 years working in 17 different workplaces.</p>
<p><strong>Moving to Norwich</strong></p>
<p>So, as soon as we moved to Norwich, on the 13th of February, we started hunting for jobs, we spent two weeks handing in C.V.s left right and centre and, one afternoon, the need for caffeine kicked in and so we stopped by a coffee cart and tried to order a coffee. Alas, they were already closing down, even though it was only 2pm. We settled for a Coffee in ""Jamie's Italian"" and continued our job hunt.</p>
<p>The very next day the same happened, only this time I thought to ask if they would like someone to work the afternoons to which they responded with an even more tempting offer. </p>
<p><strong>Working at the van</strong></p>
<p>By the 1st of March we were up and running in their place, rent agreed and to be paid until we can save up enough money to buy the coffee van outright. We changed the prices of all the drinks and food immediately and, also, the coffee brand as soon as we ran out of what was left by the owner to a locally roasted coffee from ""Wilkinson's of Norwich"" which is just round the corner from where we operate. Introducing a new selection of cakes also went down well with customers.</p>
<p>Working longer shifts, giving an Italian touch to our coffee and providing service with a smile, whatever the weather, quickly proved a success as we started to build a customer base that has now become a regular flow of locals, many of whom are now friends and meet regularly at G's Coffee Spot..</p>
<p><strong>The Snag</strong></p>
<p>You might be wondering why an apparently successful business is in need of extra funds and so were we, until we looked back on what we've gone through and achieved in just a few months. </p>
<p>Having been out of the country for a long time, my credit score had reset, there was no way for either of us to pass referencing to rent a house as we were both self-employed. The only way for us to rent a place to live was to pay 6 months rent in advance, something we couldn't afford and we were starting to get the cold shoulder, staying with friends of a friend.</p>
<p>The only option, at that point, appeared to be emergency accommodation which appeared as an old, rusty, Luton style Ford Transit which I quickly and on a very tight budget made into semi-comfortable living quarters, bedroom, bathroom and all.</p>
<p>This added to all the complications of starting fresh; needing a means of transport, buying all the necessary add-ons for the Luton and the tools to do the job, new clothes as we came across warmer weather (long live charity shops), renting private space to park the coffee van and an apparently endless list of other expenses.</p>
<p><strong>The Crunch</strong></p>
<p>We have just finished paying what we owe to our suppliers  but not in time to save up enough to be able to buy the coffee van by the deadline of the 15th of October 2016.</p>
<p>If we are unable to cough up in time, the coffee van will be sold to someone else.</p>
<p>So this is where you come in...</p>
<p><strong>What you are doing for us</strong></p>
<p>By contributing however little or however much you do, you will be offering us an amazing opportunity that, without your help, we would lose out on. It wouldn't be the end of the world if we didn't succeed, we always manage to land on our feet, but it would be amazing if we could ensure this as the first step in our career as a couple.</p>
<p>We have many plans for the future which we will carry out as and when we are able and owning the coffee van outright would give us the kick start we need and, in the mean time, would guarantee a stable income for the both of us.</p>
<p><strong>What we will do for you</strong></p>
<p>We are not looking for donations or handouts, we want to give back as much as we receive and we will do so. Be it your money's worth of coffee or a weekend break to Naples on the hunt for the best coffee in the world, whatever you invest in us, you will get back. </p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Breaking it down</strong></p>
<p>We need a total of £12'500, the asking price to buy the business. Our own savings and what we will earn in the coming weeks should bring that number down to around £7'500 which is the amount we hope to raise through crowdfunding. </p>
<p> </p>

The only option, at that point, appeared to be emergency accommodation which appeared as an old, rusty, Luton style Ford Transit which I quickly and on a very tight budget made into semi-comfortable living quarters, bedroom, bathroom and all.
This added to all the complications of starting fresh; needing a means of transport, buying all the necessary add-ons for the Luton and the tools to do the job, new clothes as we came across warmer weather (long live charity shops), renting private space to park the coffee van and an apparently endless list of other expenses.
The Crunch
We have just finished paying what we owe to our suppliers  but not in time to save up enough to be able to buy the coffee van by the deadline of the 15th of October 2016.
If we are unable to cough up in time, the coffee van will be sold to someone else.
So this is where you come in...
What you are doing for us
By contributing however little or however much you do, you will be offering us an amazing opportunity that, without your help, we would lose out on. It wouldn't be the end of the world if we didn't succeed, we always manage to land on our feet, but it would be amazing if we could ensure this as the first step in our career as a couple.
We have many plans for the future which we will carry out as and when we are able and owning the coffee van outright would give us the kick start we need and, in the mean time, would guarantee a stable income for the both of us.
What we will do for you
We are not looking for donations or handouts, we want to give back as much as we receive and we will do so. Be it your money's worth of coffee or a weekend break to Naples on the hunt for the best coffee in the world, whatever you invest in us, you will get back. 

Breaking it down
We need a total of £12'500, the asking price to buy the business. Our own savings and what we will earn in the coming weeks should bring that number down to around £7'500 which is the amount we hope to raise through crowdfunding.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>How does a Labyrinth 'feed the soul'?  </h3>
<p>When many people hear the word 'Labyrinth', they think of a puzzle maze with multiple choices and lots of blind alleys and dead ends designed to get people lost.  This is a Meditation and Prayer labyrinth—a unicursal path that leads into a center and back out--designed to get people 'found'.  As people journey toward the center of our Labyrinth, they will enjoy the renewing sights and sounds of birds, water and wind; leave their prayers and cares in a rock wall; and rest in the shade of a beautiful tree at the center of the labyrinth.  Once refreshed, they will be ready to leave the labyrinth and return to their homes, jobs and communities with what they found in the center.  </p>
<p>Labyrinths are an old thing that seems new.  They have been used in various spiritual traditions for centuries as a discipline that centers, encourages awakenings, healing and growth, or serves as a metaphor for our own pilgrimage. There's lots of resources about labyrinths at the <a href=""http://labyrinthsociety.org/resources"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">National Labyrinth Society</a>.  Yes, there really is such a thing.</p>

Although the Minnesota Men's Conference has been around for a long time, we find ourselves having to evolve in a new culture with new challenges.  The MMC nearly disappeared just a few years ago due to the waining health of it's founder Robert Bly and related financial impacts.  
Through the deep commitment of the new board of directors and the enthusiasm of a world class operational team the MMC seeks to re-establish itself and offer it's own treasures to many thousand more men.  
We need your financial contribution and word-of-mouth exposure to do that.

<p><a href=""http://www.thegravytrain.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Gravy Train</a> is a small restaurant concept designed to cater to the desire for dunking delectable food into delicious dips. Whoa, that was a mouthful - just like our wings!</p>
<p><img alt=""Mission"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.thegravytrain.ca/indiegogo/mission.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The mouth is not only used to eat, it's also used to laugh. Both behaviours are pivotal to health. That said, we're adopting a satirical approach to restaurant marketing, yet we're very serious regarding our mission to serve food with wholesome, high-quality ingredients prepared using healthier methods.</p>
<p>Foodies, funky folks and families - all aboard! It's time to put healthier food in your mouths and have a laugh doing so. (Hopefully not at the same time. A wise man once said, ""Say it, don't spray it. We want the news, not the weather!"")</p>
<p><img alt=""Food"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.thegravytrain.ca/indiegogo/food.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Our <a href=""http://www.thegravytrain.ca/menu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">menu</a> is designed around an array of gourmet gravy, delightful dips, savoury sauces and scrumptious spreads. Most of these items are homemade, with some created exclusivlely for us by popular local chefs. We also feature dips produced in small batches and bottled by companies who share our passion for high-quality ingredients.</p>
<p>Our mains, or ""dippables,"" are healthy spins on classics. Our wings and chicken strips are baked, not deep-fried. This method is more calorie-conscious and it allows our flavourful marinades to shine. Our hand-cut fries are cooked in healthier oils and sprinkled lightly with micro-mineral-rich Himalayan salt. If you're avoiding high-fat foods, we also offer seasoned sweet potato fries that are baked. Dip 'em all in our homemade ketchup with abandon, knowing it's not loaded with high fructose corn syrup - ours is crafted with malt vinegar and and a touch of organic Canadian maple syrup.<br/><br/>The menu at The Gravy Train isn't stationary, either. We feature fun, seasonal and limited-time offerings. Think: Guinness gravy for St. Patty's day, turkey poutine during Thanksgiving season. And, yes, the rumours are true - we love showing off our signature bacon gravy. Mmmm, bacon. We've got a number of taste bud-tantalizing specials up our sleeves, so there are always plenty of new destinations for your dippables.</p>
<p>As for ingredients - organics are no stranger to our menu and we do our darndest to source locally.</p>
<p>But the essential ingredient is YOU!</p>
<p><img alt=""Decor"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.thegravytrain.ca/indiegogo/decor.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The Gravy Train's interior will feature train motifs, of course! Rich, repurposed wood and rustic metal detaling with a cozy vibe. We're already scouring the 'net and our city for antique train parts and memorabilia that will become fun fixtures. We'll also display vintage photography celebrating Toronto's rich train history.</p>

The Gravy Train is a small restaurant concept designed to cater to the desire for dunking delectable food into delicious dips. Whoa, that was a mouthful - just like our wings!

The mouth is not only used to eat, it's also used to laugh. Both behaviours are pivotal to health. That said, we're adopting a satirical approach to restaurant marketing, yet we're very serious regarding our mission to serve food with wholesome, high-quality ingredients prepared using healthier methods.
Foodies, funky folks and families - all aboard! It's time to put healthier food in your mouths and have a laugh doing so. (Hopefully not at the same time. A wise man once said, ""Say it, don't spray it. We want the news, not the weather!"")

Our menu is designed around an array of gourmet gravy, delightful dips, savoury sauces and scrumptious spreads. Most of these items are homemade, with some created exclusivlely for us by popular local chefs. We also feature dips produced in small batches and bottled by companies who share our passion for high-quality ingredients.
Our mains, or ""dippables,"" are healthy spins on classics. Our wings and chicken strips are baked, not deep-fried. This method is more calorie-conscious and it allows our flavourful marinades to shine. Our hand-cut fries are cooked in healthier oils and sprinkled lightly with micro-mineral-rich Himalayan salt. If you're avoiding high-fat foods, we also offer seasoned sweet potato fries that are baked. Dip 'em all in our homemade ketchup with abandon, knowing it's not loaded with high fructose corn syrup - ours is crafted with malt vinegar and and a touch of organic Canadian maple syrup.The menu at The Gravy Train isn't stationary, either. We feature fun, seasonal and limited-time offerings. Think: Guinness gravy for St. Patty's day, turkey poutine during Thanksgiving season. And, yes, the rumours are true - we love showing off our signature bacon gravy. Mmmm, bacon. We've got a number of taste bud-tantalizing specials up our sleeves, so there are always plenty of new destinations for your dippables.
As for ingredients - organics are no stranger to our menu and we do our darndest to source locally.
But the essential ingredient is YOU!

The Gravy Train's interior will feature train motifs, of course! Rich, repurposed wood and rustic metal detaling with a cozy vibe. We're already scouring the 'net and our city for antique train parts and memorabilia that will become fun fixtures. We'll also display vintage photography celebrating Toronto's rich train history.

The Gravy Train is the brainchild of James Applegath and Craig Brissenden, long-time friends who met in high school.
James co-founded Nasa Dance Pub, a popular Queen Street West hot spot that operated for 5 years. He then shifted his business focus online and was awarded as an eBay entrepreneur of the year in 2007. Currently he works as a consultant marketing small businesses online.
For more than a decade, Craig was the general manager and head cook at The Bistro on Avenue - the famous location which spawned the St. Louis Bar & Grill franchise. He contributed to the success of several other locations and was instrumental in launching a new location a few years ago.


We're looking for $20,000 to give us the initial boost to bring this fun lil' place to fruition. Why so much? It's actually only a fraction of the total investment required to build a restaurant from scratch, buy equipment and cover rental costs while doing so.
We can't get started on our fun journey without your support so we devised perks that are jam-packed with incredible value. You're not just donating money - you're getting a healthy return on your contribution!

<p><strong>Where on Earth is Coron?</strong></p>
<p>Coron is a tropical island in the Province of Palawan. We are often called the last unspoiled frontier in the Philippines. Like many tropical paradise locations, we have tourism, but like many Caribbean islands (think Haiti), the locals are poor and live on meager incomes.

<p>All these volunteers wanted to help so they could build their own houses using the same method. They don’t have to cut down trees and harm the unique tropical animal and bird habitats.</p>
<p>Our community has started a home building revolution. We all believe our “technology” is a game changer. Our revolution is a social project where everyone has a part, changing the way we grow, and provides a livelihood for thousands.</p>

<h2><strong>What is the Strategy?</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>We decided not to fight. But to use our enemies as our enemies as our Allies, instead of fighting against the traditions, we decided to promote whats the best. </strong></h3>

<p>Instead of fighting against the traditional ways of tribal villages, we at Sughar Women Program <em>PROMOTE</em> those traditions in order to end Honor Killings. We work directly with tribal leaders, influential men and mullahs in tribal villages of Pakistan to promote traditional customs such as MUSIC, LANGUAGE AND EMBROIDERY. </p>
<p>Once we have established a presence inside the village, and we have the strong support of its leaders on our side, we create<strong> Sughar Centers</strong> where village women are recruited to join for six months to have 2 hours of sessions everday on enterprise development, self awarenes, life skills, basic education and value addition of traditional embroidery. </p>
<h2><strong>What actually happens in the Sughar Centers?</strong></h2>

<p>In this Sughar Center, while going through their life changing experience of education and awraeness, women create beautiful embroidered products which have become a huge part of the fashion industry in Pakistan as Sughar is launched as Pakistan's first ever rural women fashion brand.</p>
<p>Upon graduating from the six-month course, each woman is offered a loan to start her own small business, thus promoting entrepreneurship, which greatly influences women’s power through ownership.</p>
<p>We are now working with 700 women in the Sindh and Balochistan provinces of Pakistan. Our goal is to open more Sughar Centers throughout Pakistan, one village at a time, to reach 1 million women in the next 10 years!</p>
<h2><strong><strong>More Women and more villages need Sughar Centers. WE NEED YOUR HELP!</strong></strong></h2>

<p>________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><b style="""">What’s a Zeke’s
Coffee?</b></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We are a small local business that refuses to quit! We are a
family-owned small batch roastery, café and bakery located in the heart of the
up-and-coming East Liberty neighborhood of Pittsburgh.<span style="""">  </span>We’re in our fourth year here and we’re
still pushing forward, fueling this community with our fresh-roasted coffee and
baked goods made from local organic ingredients. <span style=""""> </span>We offer over 30 varieties of highest quality Arabica coffee,
many of which are Natural Fair Trade, roasted in small batches through the
“fluid bed” method, which ensures a very high level of consistency.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">We’ve grown quite a bit since our humble beginnings in 2011,
when you could find owner/master roaster Chris Rhodes roasting a single pound
at a time, riding around town and pouring hot
cups for construction workers from his ‘coffee bike’, and bringing “pounds to
the people” at local farmer’s markets. With the addition of Chris’ wife Brye’s
homemade baked goods, as well as a kick-ass espresso machine, business has been
growing steadily. Our customers have become like family – regulars who live/work
in East Liberty and local businesses (cafés, bars, offices, etc) that buy our
pounds – and they’ve helped to make us strong and push us to work harder every
day to extend our reach throughout Pittsburgh.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">Despite the odds (Pittsburgh has some pretty intense coffee
competition), we’ve worked our asses off to establish ourselves here in this changing
community, but we now face some pretty big challenges and need your help! We’re
working non-stop to meet growing demand, and at the same time, we are faced
with having to completely uproot our café/bakery and move to a new location by
January, as developers get ready to demo the block for new projects.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">That’s put us in a tight spot! We are lucky to have secured
TWO new locations in our rapidly growing neighborhood: </p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><b style="""">A new café/bakery</b>
(6015 Penn Ave), just across the street from where we are now! We’ve completed
the demolition and are steadily renovating the space. It will offer much more
production space for baking and plenty of indoor/outdoor seating in a cozy
environment for our growing East Lib family of customers. With this, we will be able to step up our coffee game, at the same time, highlighting local businesses with the addition of light breakfast and lunch.</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><b style="""">A new
roastery/packaging facility and drive thru </b>(6314 Broad St). We’re stoked
about this! Our new roaster there is helping to increase our production by 70%.
Plus, we are turning the location’s huge parking lot into a much-needed (so
we’ve been told) coffee DRIVE-THRU! We’re building this out in the next few
weeks. Now if we only had heat, proper electric and maybe some hot water!</p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"">With so much to do, we are running thin and need your help.

goes, but we can tell you what we need and our prospected expense to complete

<p><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; font-family: Cambria;"">2) <b style="""">Espresso Machine and Equipment:

<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style="""">Why then are we only asking for

</div></div>","Thank You! Thank You! Thank You! - We are here to stay!
 Because of YOU we are able to remain in the community and provide even better coffee and baked goods! We really can't thank you enough!  


So Now What? 
We're not done! We have 1 week left in the campaign and 2 stretch goals left! Please share the campaign and don't forget to pass the word along in the really real world. We're all about the interwebs but know that not everyone has used Indiegogo.




Stretch goal #2 OPERATION: BOOT THE BOOT! 
Speaking of that pesky parking problem...anyone who lives and works in East Liberty knows how hard it is to find all-day parking. We'd also like to utilize the 20 parking spaces at our roastery for public leasing. We've earned ourselves a fair share of parking tickets over the years, and if you work in East Lib, you know what we're talking about. We'd like to supply the public with a safe place to leave their ride in the morning and a free cup a day for any lease holder. All we need to do is a bit of clean up, install some safety lighting, and hire a line painter. If we reach $25,000 we'll be able to build you a parking lot! 


Anyone who has donated to the campaign gets first priority for the spaces and will receive a 20% discount on their lease! What happens if we reach $30,000?
Stretch goal #3 OPERATION: GREEN SPACE
We've been dreaming of adding some green space for picnicking or spring/summer get-togethers. How about a park grill for summer cookouts in the city!? Pour a few back and watch as we transform the outskirts of our property into a sweet spot to have a cup of coffee (or a beer), cook some ribs (or veggies!) and hang out with your coworkers or family. If we hit $30,000 we'll landscape the wild growth around our roastery that currently collects plastic bags and discarded trash and refuse from the city into a beautiful green space to chill and reflect. Tire Swing for the kids? Horse Shoe Pit? Picnic tables? Flower beds? New Trees? Yup. 

Pittsburgh! You've already given a lot, but we know these projects are within reach and would be a true benefit to our city. Please consider sharing or showing your support in whatever way you can.Again, Thank You! Thank You! THANK YOU!

</div></div>","Our
project started more than nine years ago, in 2007. We are dedicated to
recycling used cooking oil. Everything started as an idea to help protect the
environment because the used cooking oil in Peru is thrown to the drain and it
ends up in the rivers, which pollutes the flora and fauna. We transform these oils into
Biodiesel, an environmentally friendly fuel.During
our journey, we realized that we were helping not only the environment but also
people’s health. The impact in this case is even greater.We set up a small base that would allow us to transform used cooking oil into Biodiesel (In the pictures, my brother Renato). We were there for a year in 2007.Since
last midyear, 2015, the amount of used cooking oil that we recycle has decreased
considerably because of the international oil price fall. This situation influenced
our Biodiesel sales and our project depends directly on that. Consequently, our
project is seriously compromised. The price of our Biodiesel has a direct
relation with the fuel price.We
used to recycle the used cooking oil in the cities of Cuzco, Puno and Arequipa.
Nowadays, we are only working in Arequipa and only at 15% of our former
capacity.Join our campaign and help us continue recycling used cooking oil.WE NEED YOU!We
want to keep our project working. It is important to achieve this goal because
we have contributed to our society in a very positive way. We have had many
achievements and we are happy about that. Help us keep our dream alive!How
have we help others in our project?The environment:One liter of oil pollutes 1,000 liters of water.Chili River in Arequipa.

We take part in events where we set up a 26-foot-diameter balloon. In such events, we present our project.Every month, we were able to recycle 4,500 gallons of used cooking oil in Arequipa, 2,000 gallons in Cuzco and 500 gallons in Puno.For each 264.17 gallons of Biodiesel consumed, 1,696.6 pounds of CO2 emissions were reduced by using the biofuel instead of Diesel fuel.Health:In
Peru there is a black market of used cooking oil. This black market is really
big and it is managed by a mafia dedicated to buy this used oil, reprocess it
and then sell to restaurants and food companies as new oil. Sometimes, this
used oil is also used to produce food for animals that will later be consumed

Cancer. In the used cooking oil there are two chemical components: DIOXINES and

<p>When Hurricane Sandy struck the New Jersey shoreline in 2012, the media immediately focused on the impact on the more popular shore destinations, turning the Seaside Heights roller coaster into a symbol of the area's devastation. But while all cameras were turned on Seaside Heights, other equally devastated communities, of lesser commercial value, were overlooked.</p>
<p>The community of Union Beach, NJ was one such community. A residential town of predominately working class people saw their community equally devastated, with homes destroyed and public facilities rendered useless, but it went mostly overlooked as public officials and the media focused on the resort shore points.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of Sandy, as Union Beach struggled in relative obscurity, the town's plight caught the attention of public officials of Madison, NJ. Madison, an affluent community located to the northeast of Union Beach, also suffered damage during the storm, but far less than the shore points, and recovered more quickly.</p>
<p>Seeing the devastation in Union Beach and recognizing that it was being overlooked in the battle for attention from media and public officials, the community of Madison decided to take action, contributing time of its residents and resources to help Union Beach recover. In these times, it is a rare example of one community voluntarily helping another to overcome an unprecedented natural disaster.</p>
<p>This mini-documentary (10 to 15 minutes in length) will document the damage and the story of these two communities coming together, the relationships that are created in the process, the challenges, and the vision for the future.</p>
<p>Once produced and premiered, the documentary will be posted online for viewing. The producer will also seek time on Madison and Union Beach's local access channels, and explore other markets for distribution (NJ public TV, etc.)</p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>I am seeking $9,000 to produce this documentary. All funds will go to cover the compensation of the producer/writer/director (hereinafter the ""producer"") for time spent performing pre-production, production, and post-production tasks in support of the production, all production and post-production equipment and software required, as well as anticipated out of pocket expenses (travel expenses to Union Beach and back), potential costs to acquire rights to relevant Sandy-based local news footage, as well as still photographs which may not yet have been acquired.</p>
<p>All donors will receive a complimentary DVD of the documentary for their contribution and  will be credited on a website dedicated to the documentary. All donors who donate $200 or more will  be expressly named in the documentary credits, and be invited to the documentary's premiere, which will be screened at a place to be announced either in Madison or Union Beach. The premiere will be preceded by a small reception.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Peace and Love my good people...I am Bro. Gil Pritchett and this is something I feel very passionate about and I must take an active approach now, so that it will by faith encourage others to do the same , in their own authentic way. I have some 34 years of professional and community experience in the performining and creative arts having worked throughout the entire USA including Broadway and regional venues across America and internationally from France to Japan, all over Canada, Madrid and Manaco. My expertise is Musical Theatre, Digital Music Production/Composition, and Empowering the Creative Mind of Kids 4 years to Adults through the Performing Arts as a Teaching Artist, now living back home in Dallas, Texas. My campaign is simple yet challenging in that it involves a whole community, district 8 of Dallas, Texas. My action is this:"" Season Of My Heart"", a musical extravaganza featuring a synergy of old school Blues,R&amp;B, Gospel,Jazz and Adult Contemporary music, is the vehicle I will use to shine a new innovative and positive light on a situation that effects hundreds of families, children and seniors alike in the Highland Hills Community of Dallas. I live in this community and so does my Mother. There are no grocery stores in the immediate community...the closest one is about 2.5 miles away. It has been said , the corporate stores won't come to this community for various reasons, and with all due respect, that is not good enough for me to sit by and allow this kind of decay to prosper. The district residences is made up of many seniors  and some disabled families members,who may or may not have transportation or even able to drive if they have access, to the stores over 2.5 miles from the community and this is a very disturbing issue to me. ""Season of My Heart"" will be used as a platform to encourage Self Help, in the community ,by creating a community fund, from a large portion of the proceeds, that will be used to help implement a community co-op oppoprtunity for the people living in the immediate community of district 8. It has been proven time and time again how taking responsibility for oneself and ones community , especially through the creative and artistic approach, invites, engage, and inspire people to action, thinking outside of the box and coming  up with innovative and creative ideas to help solve the problems facing the community. I believe people want to change, but sometimes the ideas are missing and the status quo speaks the same , no change theories, to the masses. I believe it is my duty as a member of this community, that is District 8, to act and do it in the most creative and professional manner possible as to why ""Season of My Heart"" is my approach to initiating this resolve. It will take time , discipline, faith and people of like minds, to make this kind of significant change happen but it is worth the effort if we can inspire this kind of change. Your contribution will go a long way towards establishing a synergy between  community, family, creativity, including the creating of jobs in the community,self help and thinking outside of the box for many people in and around the district 8 community.Building an entrepreneurial skill set for people who may have never thought it possible for them. Thank you and do keep us lifted up! Peace and Love Bro. Gil</p>
<p>There is a huge vacant building right in the heart of Highland Hills ,(Simpson Stuart and Bonnie View Road), it has been sitting there like a wounded animal, for several years. I want to egage the people of the community to purchase this building or get it donated towards our efforts, to take responsibility for what we need, here in our community of District 8. ""Season Of My Heart"" is a vehicle I believe as a professional artist, will engage the people to begin this on going process...It is my charge and I accept the challenge, will you help me, help others, help themselves. Peace and Love Bro. Gil</p>
<p>The journey of a thousand miles begins with just 1 step!</p>
<p> </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Please understand, I know the amount I am seeking here is not even a drop in the bucket of what it will take to complete a task such as this, nor is that my intent here... my intent is to raise enough money to establish the vehicle, to which through advertisement and media response, exposure and dialogue of action, will engage corporate and individual entrepreneurial support, here in the city ,to ensure the over all goal of establishing a co-op community grocery store, succeed in the Highland Hills District. ""Season Of My Heart"" will be the nucleus of what I pray will be a windfall of new innovative approaches to a very old issue in the community of people of color across the Americas. Taking responsibility for what we need in our community is empowering and sets an awesome example for our children as to what the future can hold for them and their children. Your contribution will set in motion something that will re educate the community and offer new skill sets of innovative, out of the box critical thinking, which is so vital to the survival of our children, and you will be able to look out here ,eventually, at the Highland Hills Distict and know YOU, were part of this growth and develpoment.</p>
<p>The $5000.00 will wholly go towards securing a venue for ""Season Of My Heart"", staffing, promotion, and any other incidentals that occur in mounting a theatrical production of this nature. Making sure I can staff the very best musicians within reason because we will be asking  people to come and spend money towards building this fund that will go beyond the ticket price of the production which means I must put the best foot forward. I am the best at what I do.... our ambition is to use ""Season Of My Heart"" as a stepping stone to building a dynamic community fund and thus creating jobs, developing community outreach as a result of the efforts to take responsibility for what is lacking in our community. It is a huge undertaking one that will be on going, but one that must be initiated and the spirit is leading me to do what I can in this regard.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The impact this will have on the future of our children, in this community and around the nation, as they begin to hear and see the results, will be astounding and far reaching. YOU have the opportunity to be one of the founding fathers/mothers, if you will, of the new Highland Hills Communtiy, Co-op Grocery Market Place and see your contribution really make a difference.</p>
<p>""Season Of My Heart"" had a sold out limited run in New York City at Cobi's Place and I believe it is the most effective way for me as an artist to approach this issue and give back to the community. I have witnessed this success in Los Angeles as well as New York City; it is only fair that Dallas, HIghland Hills, be next in line. I love my community and the people deserve to live better with more real access. </p>
<p>""Anything that shines a positive and productive light on an issue that is not so productive but is divisive and discriminatory, is a ""THING"" worth investing, is my belief and so ,this is my calling and I pray you will step out on faith with me here in your best authentic way to contribute what you can. Peace and Love Bro. Gil""</p>
<p>You and your contribution will certainly be acknowledged and reconized in all media , promotional and visual support attached to ""Season Of My Heart"" and the Highland Hills Community Co-Op Grocery and Market Place.</p>

The journey of a thousand miles begins with just 1 step!
 


What We Need & What You Get
Please understand, I know the amount I am seeking here is not even a drop in the bucket of what it will take to complete a task such as this, nor is that my intent here... my intent is to raise enough money to establish the vehicle, to which through advertisement and media response, exposure and dialogue of action, will engage corporate and individual entrepreneurial support, here in the city ,to ensure the over all goal of establishing a co-op community grocery store, succeed in the Highland Hills District. ""Season Of My Heart"" will be the nucleus of what I pray will be a windfall of new innovative approaches to a very old issue in the community of people of color across the Americas. Taking responsibility for what we need in our community is empowering and sets an awesome example for our children as to what the future can hold for them and their children. Your contribution will set in motion something that will re educate the community and offer new skill sets of innovative, out of the box critical thinking, which is so vital to the survival of our children, and you will be able to look out here ,eventually, at the Highland Hills Distict and know YOU, were part of this growth and develpoment.
The $5000.00 will wholly go towards securing a venue for ""Season Of My Heart"", staffing, promotion, and any other incidentals that occur in mounting a theatrical production of this nature. Making sure I can staff the very best musicians within reason because we will be asking  people to come and spend money towards building this fund that will go beyond the ticket price of the production which means I must put the best foot forward. I am the best at what I do.... our ambition is to use ""Season Of My Heart"" as a stepping stone to building a dynamic community fund and thus creating jobs, developing community outreach as a result of the efforts to take responsibility for what is lacking in our community. It is a huge undertaking one that will be on going, but one that must be initiated and the spirit is leading me to do what I can in this regard.
The Impact
The impact this will have on the future of our children, in this community and around the nation, as they begin to hear and see the results, will be astounding and far reaching. YOU have the opportunity to be one of the founding fathers/mothers, if you will, of the new Highland Hills Communtiy, Co-op Grocery Market Place and see your contribution really make a difference.
""Season Of My Heart"" had a sold out limited run in New York City at Cobi's Place and I believe it is the most effective way for me as an artist to approach this issue and give back to the community. I have witnessed this success in Los Angeles as well as New York City; it is only fair that Dallas, HIghland Hills, be next in line. I love my community and the people deserve to live better with more real access. 
""Anything that shines a positive and productive light on an issue that is not so productive but is divisive and discriminatory, is a ""THING"" worth investing, is my belief and so ,this is my calling and I pray you will step out on faith with me here in your best authentic way to contribute what you can. Peace and Love Bro. Gil""
You and your contribution will certainly be acknowledged and reconized in all media , promotional and visual support attached to ""Season Of My Heart"" and the Highland Hills Community Co-Op Grocery and Market Place.

<p>We are opening San Francisco’s first not-for-profit bar where 100% of profits go to development projects across the globe!</p>
<p><strong>We believe that making change should be easy, and fun. </strong></p>

<p><strong>THE BAR:</strong></p>
<p>We are working hard to open a unique type of bar: a place where people can relax, celebrate, and give back at the same time!</p>
<p>It’s a simple idea: we cover all of our costs like any other bar, but donate <strong>100% of profits</strong> to life-changing projects around the world. 25% of each drink is automatically donated, so patrons know they are already making a difference with each drink.</p>
<p><strong>Before we settle down and sign a lease, we’re going to throw 6 pop-up parties around SF. We’ll set up bar, drinks, DJ and everything in between-giving you a sweet taste of what’s to come. </strong></p>

<p><strong>THE IMPACT:</strong></p>
<p>We want to build a business that constantly generates funds for creating change. Let’s re-write the norms of fundraising — we can keep funding and bringing incredible projects to life as long as we have customers to celebrate giving back. </p>

<p><strong>THE FOUNDATION:</strong></p>
<p>The UL Foundation is the partner non-profit (registered 501c3) to the United Libations bar. While the bar and the foundation are separate entities, they work together to realize the common goal of bettering lives. The bar runs the event operations while the foundation arranges donation to the projects around the world. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>HOW WE WORK:</strong></p>
<p>1)     CONNECT: with small scale projects around the globe</p>
<p>2)     CHECK: that they meet our funding specifications</p>

We want to build a business that constantly generates funds for creating change. Let’s re-write the norms of fundraising — we can keep funding and bringing incredible projects to life as long as we have customers to celebrate giving back. 

THE FOUNDATION:
The UL Foundation is the partner non-profit (registered 501c3) to the United Libations bar. While the bar and the foundation are separate entities, they work together to realize the common goal of bettering lives. The bar runs the event operations while the foundation arranges donation to the projects around the world. 
 
HOW WE WORK:
1)     CONNECT: with small scale projects around the globe
2)     CHECK: that they meet our funding specifications
3)     GENERATE: money from every drink bought at the bar
4)     DONATE: the profit to fund and complete a project
5)     REPEAT: turn to the next project on our list and repeat!
                        
 
FUNDING SPECIFICATIONS:

The project is by a registered 501c3 non-profit organization
The project's total goal for funding must be <$3,000
The project holds no terrorist, political or religious affiliations
The project is outside of the United States
The project is in the fields of: Education, Health, Poverty, Hunger, Human Rights, Environment, or Wildlife
The project has a third-party sponsor that validates its data and reports, as well as performs financial audits through local and international experts 
 
FIRST 2 PROJECTS WE HAVE SELECTED TO FUND:
1) English Classes for Haitian Orphans
Location: Port au Prince, Haiti
Fundraising Goal: $2400
This project will provide English classes for at minimum 30 children who were left orphaned by the devastating 2010 earthquake. These classes have two main objectives: to help build the kids' self-confidence, and to set them up with English skills that will dramatically improve their employability in Haiti.                          
            
2) Building a Rainwater Collection System
Location: Bweyale, Uganda
Fundraising Goal: $2,900
This project will fund a rainwater collection system to bring a second source of water to approximately 1400 children and 1200 local residents of Bweyale, Uganda. Bweyale has no other nearby water source apart from a small stream which often dries up.
             
Bweyale children who will benefit from the new water source.
 
WHAT $8,500 WILL DO:
$1500    Start-Up Operations
$1800    Rent
$1500    Bar Equipment
$1500    Glassware
$1500    Inventory

<p>I've love chocolate and I love spicy food and I've never had a candy bar that combined the two tastes successfully. No offense to other products on the market that try. They are serious and dark which is okay for once in a while. Kung Pao Chocolate Bars are milk chocolate with a proprietary blend of spices that is fun and satisfies both the chocoholic and the chili head.</p>
<p><em>Fact: there are more Chinese restaurants in the US than there are McDonald's</em></p>
<p>I developed Kung Pao Chocolate Bars over the last few years. I was living in Chinatown in Los Angeles and was considering opening a cafe and gift shop. I did a lot of research on food that was being offered and noticing what the market wasn't providing that might be needed (a “gap” in the market). The only sweets that were consistently being offered were baked goods. Cookies (fortune and almond predominately) and once in a while ice cream were the only sweet treats I could find. There were at least 2 different types of hot sauces or chilli on every restaurant table. I started to see some exotic, expensive dark chocolate bars with chilies in them. I tried all of them. They were all good but I felt like they would go better with a cigar and a bottle of port then after eating a steaming bowl of spicy pho or kung pao chicken.</p>
<p><br/><em>Fact: kung pao chicken is the most popular item ordered in Chinese restaurants</em></p>
<p>Kung Pao Chocolate Bars are produced using a proprietary recipe of spices in a high quality milk chocolate bar.  There is a traditional peanut and a version without peanuts.  The logo and characters (Kung the chili and Pao the Peanut) were designed by Los Angeles artist, Philip Lumbang.</p>
<p>We plan on producing Kung Pao Chocolate Fudge Sauce and Kung Pao Chocolate Ice Cream Bars in the future.</p>
<p>We plan on selling Kung Pao Chocolate Bars in retail candy stores, convenience stores and as a point of purchase item in Chinese restaurants.  There are many people out there who love all their food to be spicy from their cottage cheese to their tooth paste, everything is better with a little heat!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><em><strong>WHO WE ARE:<br/></strong></em></p>
<p>Great Full Gardens is a Nevada owned Small Corporation owned by Reno native, Julianna Scala.  Together with her husband Gino, and a great team of people they have successfully built the first hydroponic tomato greenhouse in Northern Nevada, opened and run the Pathways café, which serves the University of Nevada Reno as well as created the Gino The Soup Man brand of frozen soups and entrees.  Currently, Gino The Soup Man brand can be found at Great Basin Community Food CoOp,Whole Foods Market and Swill Coffee and Wine.  Our products are currently served at Swill Coffee and Wine, Nevada Wolf Store, Lighthouse Coffee, Too Souls Tea Company and The Hub Coffee. </p>
<p><em><strong>The Great Full Gardens Concept<br/></strong></em>Great Full Gardens Cafe &amp; Eatery (scheduled to open Feb 2013) is a concept that was born from a desire to provide the community with a fast, casual eatery with a strong focus on locally sourced food, community support, and sustainability.  It will be a place where people who are looking for a healthier way of eating can enjoy everything from a vegan wrap to an all natural beef burger that comes from grass fed, hormone free cow.  Out restaurant will cater to the specialty diet as well as the person looking for just great flavor and a menu that is unique and delicious.</p>
<p>Great Full Gardens' mission is to enrich the lives of our guests, our employees, and our community through providing wholesome, great tasting food and beverages at the best value possible, offering a life enriching customer service experience and creating a healthy, happy family of employees. We achieve these objectives by sourcing and supporting local product whenever possible, creating a warm, welcoming environment for dining patrons, as well as hiring and retaining a staff capable of delivering an exceptional experience to every customer, every time!</p>
<p>Great Full Gardens is committed to providing to their employees the healthiest workspace available in food production today.  For years foodservice and production employees have had to endure tough working environments by standing on hard floors and breathing in toxic gas emissions that come from the use of gas appliances.  We are providing an all-electric kitchen which is free of toxic gases, special floor mats that absorb much of the compression on the body, clean air, and a loving environment. </p>
<p>As Great Full Gardens continues to grow and expand their employee base and community presence, we are presented with the exciting challenge of maintaining our committment to sustainability, community support and employee nurturing.</p>
<p><em><strong>Briefly describe your campaign and why it’s important to you:</strong></em></p>
<p>Our campaign is built around solar power production, solar water collection for hot water, and the elimination of toxic gases and fumes in our space.  We will do this by installing a min 24 panel solar array on the roof of the facility, installing a water collector on the roof of the facility, creating Reno's first all-electric solar powered kitchen.  This will not only significantly reduce our carbon footprint, we will be able to create energy for the city and provide our kitchen staff with a healthy, non-toxic environment to work in.</p>
<p><strong>Express the magnitude of what contributors will help you achieve:</strong></p>
<p>With the experience of working in kitchens consulting with chefs, manufacturing facilities, and restaurant owners, we have come to some basic conclusions.  The kitchen work environment is not generally a healthy environment for people to work in. </p>
<p>Gas appliances are used for efficiency standards that are cost based.  Although a company can save money by using them, they come at a price we are not willing to pay.  Emissions and flames are breathed into the employee lungs and over time can cause emphysema, chronic cough, and of course cancer.  We cannot use this business model to make a living.  </p>
<p>In addition,   the use of gas is toxic to our long term economy.  We are willing to pay more for energy and over time reduce those costs with solar installations because of two main concerns.  Our team’s health and our local energy footprint.  With electric appliances we have the ability to manufacturer energy with solar installations.  Although the initial costs will be higher we believe that there is no other choice. </p>
<p>Finally, this kind of commitment demonstrates to the community that we, as a community, can take a large footprint off the grid and be creators of our  our own energy sources.  The effect would snowball into other businesses which would make a difference in our communitie's effect on the environment. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><strong>Break it down for folks in more detail:</strong></p>
<p>24 Panel  Solar Panel Array $28,000</p>
<p>Solar Water Collector - $5,000</p>
<p>Tomlinson C-Kure Light Anti-Fatigue Mat - $6,500</p>
<p>The solar panels that we are using are……AC Unison,PM240PA0 Photovoltaic Module with Microinverter.  This particular system Harvests 5 to 25% more energy than traditional systems and are Designed for 25-year reliability.</p>
<p>Their Modular flexibility suits any budget or rooftop.  The Simplified PV system reduces installation costs and with</p>
<p>No high voltage, DC means safe installation and ownership. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>BenQ Solar AC Unison is a new breakthrough in solar photovoltaic (PV) technology. BenQ Solar combines its premium PV module with reliable microinverter technology to maximize PV benefits for installers and end users.</p>
<p>The integrated microinverter converts module DC to grid compliant AC at each module. This increases system performance by up to 25%, reduces shading losses, and makes PV safer to install and own. BenQ</p>
<p>Solar AC Unison is installed, monitored, and maintained with ease. All BenQ Solar PV products are manufactured under BenQ Solar’s strict quality control standards. BenQ Solar AC Unison is designed for 25 years of efficient production.  We estimate that this starter system will handle about 25-30% of our needs and give us future growth options within the system. </p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>We APPRECIATE ALL CONTRIBUTIONS!<br/></strong></p>
<p>All contributors, regardless of the amount, will receive a special mention and Thank you on the Gratitude Page of our website.  We have put together some great tiered contribution perks as well, please check them out!</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Describe where the funds go if you don’t reach your entire goal.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong>We firmly believe in this project and that it will have a positive influence in the community, on the health of our employees and that the environment benefits as well.  All funds collected will be used towards this vision.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our vision is that our Café be a model to other businesses, especially food operations which comprise the largest segment of power and resource use to use what earth is providing rather than traditional power sources that damage the earth.</p>
<p>For Great Full Gardens this project means the world to us.  We are committed to providing a place that our employees can work to provide healthy, great tasting food to our community while be nourished in prosperity and joy in their employment.  We are doing it now in at the University of Nevada Reno’s Pathway’s Café and this would amplify its effect.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is all about giving back. Yeah, we love making our products but it's also a vehicle that enables us to partner with community organizations, foster creativity, and support the community. The impact goes beyond Washington, DC too. We're hoping this is a trend that will spread, we believe there needs to be a focus put back on small retailers and manufacturers that truly do a craft and make an artform. </p>

</div></div>","What We're Up To:
We're opening a store in Washington, DC to bring you custom handmade one of a kind bags and jewelry made right in our store to your specifications as well as unique artwork by local DC artists. It's all about our core values of Community, Creativity, and Equality. 
Everyone likes to know where their goods are coming from right? We all are itching to see more made in America, right? Well here at Berwick we're being the change we want to see and we're so excited to be doing it here in DC with hopes this ""locally made"" movement will spread. The store is going to be all about making things locally, responsibly, fostering the creative spirit in all of us, and giving back to our community.
Every item in our store will be unique and in addition to ready made items that you'll be able to buy right away all of our styles will be fully customizable. Pick a style, select from a bunch of unique fabrics that we buy in low quantities to ensure uniqueness, and we make it right in the store ready for pickup in a couple weeks. We're currently forming partnerships with community partners and charities. Feel free to let us know if you know of any that share similar values to ours. We'd love to hear from you. Currently we're proud supporters of The DC Center, and Scrap DC. Be sure to check them out.

We've got some great rewards for our supporters! Be the first to get your hands on some of our unique bag and jewelry designs.

The Impact
This is all about giving back. Yeah, we love making our products but it's also a vehicle that enables us to partner with community organizations, foster creativity, and support the community. The impact goes beyond Washington, DC too. We're hoping this is a trend that will spread, we believe there needs to be a focus put back on small retailers and manufacturers that truly do a craft and make an artform.

<p>We live in a world where the wisdom of our elders rots away in urine stanched buildings. Our loved ones die alone. Children are raised by flashy colorful screens. Teens replace speech with communication through their thumbs via text. Growing up we are taught that to succeed in life we must go to school, more school, get a job, spend sunny days in a cubical, come home, kiss the wife go to bed, start all over until we grow too old to be of use, then rot away in nursing homes. So the cycle goes round and round.</p>
<p><br/>In public schools where we are not taught to cook, grow our own food, make our own medicines, clothes ourselves, speak from our soul through the arts, use our imagination, or share our stories. Our parents tell us not to talk to strangers. But I have learned from this thing called life, that the people I meet at the bus, street, or alley often carry as much teachings as Jesus, Mohammad, White Buffalo Calf Woman, or Buddha.</p>
<p>What is the point of living if we don't share our life with each other, if the lessons learned in life die with us? What is the point of being born with sparkling gifts if we don't use or share them? I do not see the logic behind living in a world where people live right next to people and yet don't even know their name. That's okay I understand that it works out for some people, but it is not how I want to live.</p>

<p>Create a multi-generational outdoor school. Focused on the importance of integrating every age. Offering education in food from seedling to table, renewable energy, arts, spirituality, philosophy, etc. by using the apprenticeship system and encouraging the youngest to eldest person the opportunity to share their passions with the group. Also offering retreat for artist, writers, and different spiritual paths to broaden the spectrum of education in the community and provide extra revenue to continue and expand.</p>

<p>My name is Lily, I was born backwards with a right leg half the length of my left creating an interesting life from the beginning. I was blessed with two of the most amazing parents on the earth. They home schooled me so that they could continue their travels around the country and world. Immersing me in the education of life. I did internships with local artists, and learned through trial and error I could achieve anything I could set my mind to. By 13 I had been in three art shows, two in my parent's office, one in a professional gallery. By 11 through art I had raised enough to buy myself the lap top I had set my mind on.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In High School my family moved to an intentional community/retreat center cradled in the Cascade Mountains of Central Washington. The school I went to had 6-8 other high school and middle school students and one teacher. We ate our meals with the local volunteers ages 0-75+, participated in weekly and monthly chores, every member of the community contributing to the greater good. In school we had the opportunity to study any topic of our interest with community members with said expertise, from German, cooking, dance, to wilderness EMT training, and diesel mechanics. We took our ideas as students and put on fashion shows with clothes made of garbage, produced a radio show, wrote a play, and put on dance parties. Age was just a number.</p>
<p><img alt=""High school"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc6/197200_4927801093_1174_n.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""My whole high school, group shot.""/></p>
<p>The village hosted weekly forums on any topic you could possibly imagine from, warm fuzzies, to volunteering in Palestine taught by passionate members of the community to visiting professors. It was these two years that the root my community design lies.</p>
<p>Since then I have moved on to two years in college, and several years of travel around the country, volunteer work on farms, basic life. Waiting for the day to launch into action. Quietly networking, and checking daily for the perfect piece of property.</p>

<h3>The money factor:</h3>
<p>Obviously this is not a project that will pop up overnight.</p>
<p><strong>Phase I.</strong> Buy land. I have found 688 acres bordering national forest land in central Washington. $150,000 will get the roots to create the eco village and begin the process one tree at a time.</p>

<p><strong>Phase II.</strong> Drill well, and get plants, trees, and berry bushes in the ground so by the time the village is established for living on a large scale the land will be developed enough to feed the quantity of people. Well costs $11,000 to build, $3,000 to irrigate, $5,000 for trees (apple, apricot, cherry, elderberry, nectarine, pear, peach, plum), vegetable garden, and berry patch. $1,000 for outdoor community kitchen for hosting classes, and events.</p>
<p>These are the baby steps needed to begin this journey. From there the land would slowly begin to pay through natural building courses, permaculture courses, edible wild plant classes, etc, and begin to grow one building at a time. The most important start is having the land for roots, to grow up from.</p>

<p>Let's start helping out our neighbors, drop the shackles of society and dance together in the rain.</p>
<p>Chip in to support a new kind of education for Central Washington. Help me provide a place for the local elderly to get out in the sunshine and take care of plants. Help me to bring children away from screens and play and learn under the big blue sky.</p>

<p>As many of you know, I am in Uganda for the summer working for Slum Dwellers International/ACTogether Uganda. It has been an amazing experience, and something I am so proud to be a part of. Their model for helping the poor to rise out of devastation is the most effective I have ever witnessed. Briefly, this organization helps to mobilize through teaching individuals to save, then using the collective savings of the community to improve sanitation, install clean water sources, teach vocational skills to women, and many more projects. It is the classic ""Teach a man to fish, rather than give a man a fish"" model, and is sustainable, effective and involves entire communities in improving their own lives.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the night before I arrived in Uganda on 1 June, most of the staff was involved in a very bad traffic accident in our newly purchased vehicle. There were no fatalities but sadly, some of our members sustained severe injuries and are still recovering. Additionally, after rolling several times, the vehicle was completely destroyed. Since the accident, the organization has incurred a significant increase in operational expenses; without a vehicle, we are spending considerable resources on transportation allowances that could be better utilized for the community projects. On Friday, July 26, 2013, I am holding a Happy Hour fundraiser in an effort to replace the car. Mish Mash Restaurant, Kampala, has generously donated their space, and I am collecting donations for the event, including beverages, entertainment and raffle prizes. I will be bartending (along with special guest Jennica Kilbride from NYC!!!) and the tips will also go towards the vehicle. It is going to be a fabulous evening!</p>
<p>I wish all my friends could be there with me, but you can still help!!! I'm asking you to donate, and no amount is too small (or too big!). It's easy! All you have to do is follow the easy instructions on this campaign page, and please know that your donation is safe and secure and that 100% of your donation goes directly towards the purchase of the new vehicle and nothing else! Your generosity will help countless people, and we are all grateful for your generosity. Thank you so much for your support! Please know how much this project means to me and to so many other people. Much love, Sue</p></div>","Dear Friends-

<p class=""lead"">Needle in a Haystack Special Needs Childcare is a specialist childcare referral agency; we work solely with families who have children with additional needs (and their siblings) in the Boston Metro and surrounding New England area. We provide experienced nannies, buddies, mentors and childcare workers for positions that may be full or part-time, daily or live-in, temporary and permanent.</p>
<p>We deal with placements for babies, children and teens with a range of additional needs including mild learning difficulties, physical or learning disabilities and social-emotional and behavioral needs.</p>
<p>I am Robert Jones, Founder of Needle in a Haystack Childcare and here is a little about my background. Having started my education in Providence RI and receiving an Associate’s Degree in Culinary Arts, I decided to rekindle my enjoyment of working with children that started when I was seventeen as a voluntary year long class assignment. I applied to work as a Kitchen counselor at a camp in Ashford, CT as a summer internship. The camp is a residential summer camp for children between the ages of seven and fifteen with a chronic illness. I was offered the position as kitchen supervisor and camp counselor. Upon arriving it did not take me long to realize that I was at someplace very special. I felt extremely overwhelmed with the responsibility of taking care of the children and the trust that their families had in me as part of the staff. I started to question my ability to adequately meet the special needs and challenges many of these children faced. Looking back I can honestly say that my worries were ill conceived and wrongly placed. I have never felt that I belonged somewhere as I did at that camp. My first summer there was such a life changing experience that it is hard for me to attempt to explain it in words. After that experience I sought out to become an expert in working with children. I finished my culinary degree and started a second degree in Psychology while being employed as a Nanny for two young boys for 4.5 years. I enjoyed working with children so much that I worked as a substitute teacher in an integrated classroom when my charges were both old enough to attend school. After receiving my Psychology degree, I decided to study abroad at RoehamptonUniversity in London, UK where I received my Master’s in Education. I have enjoyed many different positions highlighting my passion of working with children, specifically with special needs; ranging from Elementary School Teacher, Learning Support Specialist and Behavioral Specialist to ABA Tutor and Nanny all the while enjoying every experience enough to allow it to lead me to the next.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Those past experiences have led me to point my passion in another direction. Instead of being the nanny who works great with children I want to touch more lives by finding others like me. People who love working with children but work especially well with those who have additional needs and put them in the homes that need them. Many parents who have children with additional needs will tell you that one of the hardest things is finding childcare that their child will respond too, who understands exactly what is being asked of them and who can deal with the good days as well as the bad ones that come with this type of position. While I still love working with children I have realized that there is a need for specialized childcare. I understand that being a mainstream nanny and being a special needs nanny are two completely different roles—and they require different types of people. My agency is about those special people and the special children that they love to work with. I want to share with my customers the benefit of  my 15 years experience working with children and showcase my ability in communicating with and understanding all children to help them find that Needle in Haystack that will make a positive difference in their family’s life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I hope that you all will help me make this a reality. I am asking for assistance for advertising and marketing the agency to the communities that can use my services. Contributions will also go to help with some of the overhead cost of a business that is just starting out. (e.g. Supplies, incorporation fees ect..)</p>

<p class=""FreeFormA"">We are producing the first recognized Mexican whiskey that is comparable to the best selling whiskeys in the world.</p>
<p class=""FreeFormA"">Our goal is to raise $100,000.  Our funding will allow us to expand production, achieve nationwide distribution and export to our first international markets.  </p>
<p class=""FreeFormA"">More importantly, your donation drives Dorwart Whiskey to a scale that allows us to contribute 1% of annual net profits to education services in our local community for the life of the company.</p>
<p class=""FreeFormA"">I am Larry Dorwart, founder of Dorwart Whiskey and Distiller.  I have been pleased with the local success of my hand crafted whiskey.  But global scale allows my wife Eve, my team and I to give back in a big way and make a huge difference in our local community.</p>
<p class=""FreeFormA"">Why not contribute and be a part of making dreams come true?</p>
<div><strong>IT'S OUR AZTEC CORN THAT MAKES OUR WHISKEY SO GOOD</strong></div>
<div><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/880120/pictures/full/20130619073627-DSC05929.JPG?1371652591"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></div>
<div><span> </span></div>
<div><span>Dorwart’s Single Cask Sour Mash Whiskey is the pride of our distillery. It is based on our Prohibition era Dorwart family recipe and is made with 100% natural, locally grown Aztec corn which originates in Mexico thousands of years ago. Our corn supplier, a local generational ranchero, has access to his fields only by mule to climb the winding path to his fields where he plants and harvests the crop in the Sierra Madre Mountains surrounding Boca de Tomatlan. By planting the Aztec corn at this high altitude, our corn thrives in the nutrient rich soil, temperate climate, and cool winds which roll in from the Pacific Ocean. </span></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Our 100% natural Aztec corn creates the start of an exceptional liquor.  We use a 100% corn bill recipe for our sour mash and our fermentation tanks are not sealed so that the natural yeast in the environment blends with our starter yeast to produce a ﬂavour unique to Dorwart Whiskey. All of our products contain an all natural recipe, revealing the true essence of the hand-selected, local ingredients. After being distilled, the liquor goes into custom-charred, once used, French red wine, white oak barrels.  The Mexican sun and humidity naturally age our whiskey, just as the natural elements of the Dorwart family farm had done for the 'shine so many years ago. What’s left is something completely new and refreshing that we have introduced to the whiskey market?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The quality, rarity, and extra effort given to our corn will be evident when you taste Dorwart Whiskey.  Our whiskey is reminiscent of some of Kentucky's lighter bourbons with caramel overtones. It is fresh to the palate with a light, long-lasting finish.  No other whiskey has what Dorwart Whiskey has - Aztec corn, our age-old Prohibition era family recipe, and the natural elements of our home in Mexico. </div>

<p class=""FreeFormA""><strong>HELPING OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES - IT BEGAN WITH A DREAM</strong></p>
<p class=""FreeFormA"">I was raised in Lampman Saskatchewan, Canada.  I spent my adult life building oil and gas plants and pipelines in Alberta, Canada.</p>
<p class=""FreeFormA"">My wife and I have been spending winter months over the past 10 years in a small fishing village, Boca de Tomatlán, 15 minutes south of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.  We had fallen in love with this village, the people, their traditions and dreamed about retiring there, it was where we wanted to plant our feet for the rest of our lives. However, we weren't really ready to retire.  </p>
<p class=""FreeFormA"">My grandparents and father use to produce and market moonshine during the prohibition days.  My first experience at distilling began at the age of 11 and I continued with my passion through out my life.  We purchased a 100 litre stainless steel still from the United States, brought it to Boca de Tomatlán and began playing around with my family moonshine recipe, bourbon and sour mash recipes.  </p>
<p class=""FreeFormA"">After doing some research we had discovered that there weren't any whiskey distillers in Mexico. All whiskey products are imported into the country.  We saw an opportunity, well actually we saw a couple of opportunities.</p>
<p class=""FreeFormA"">The first opportunity is that people from around the world have purchased our whiskey products. We've been featured in a book written in the United Kingdom and approached by retailers to sell our products in Wal-Mart, Sam's and various liquor outlets in Puerto Vallarta.  Liquor distributors from the United States, Canada, India, China and across Mexico want to export and buy our Single Cask Whiskey.</p>
<p class=""FreeFormA"">This presents a GOOD problem, but a big problem, in that we just do not have the distilling capacity to meet the growing demand.  We have decided we DON’T want to remain a small business.</p>
<p class=""FreeFormA"">The second opportunity was our deciding factor.   Growing will give us the opportunity to provide something back to this village that we love so much.  Through the years we have done little things, quietly, but now it is time to do great things. We see an opportunity to provide jobs, bring more tourism into the village, funding for the schools, opportunities for the children to attend, finish and achieve further education through scholarships.  We saw an opportunity to encourage them to follow their dreams.  </p>

</div></div>","NOT JUST WHAT WE ARE DOING, BUT WHY WE ARE DOING IT
We are producing the first recognized Mexican whiskey that is comparable to the best selling whiskeys in the world.
Our goal is to raise $100,000.  Our funding will allow us to expand production, achieve nationwide distribution and export to our first international markets.  
More importantly, your donation drives Dorwart Whiskey to a scale that allows us to contribute 1% of annual net profits to education services in our local community for the life of the company.
I am Larry Dorwart, founder of Dorwart Whiskey and Distiller.  I have been pleased with the local success of my hand crafted whiskey.  But global scale allows my wife Eve, my team and I to give back in a big way and make a huge difference in our local community.
Why not contribute and be a part of making dreams come true?
IT'S OUR AZTEC CORN THAT MAKES OUR WHISKEY SO GOOD

 
Dorwart’s Single Cask Sour Mash Whiskey is the pride of our distillery. It is based on our Prohibition era Dorwart family recipe and is made with 100% natural, locally grown Aztec corn which originates in Mexico thousands of years ago. Our corn supplier, a local generational ranchero, has access to his fields only by mule to climb the winding path to his fields where he plants and harvests the crop in the Sierra Madre Mountains surrounding Boca de Tomatlan. By planting the Aztec corn at this high altitude, our corn thrives in the nutrient rich soil, temperate climate, and cool winds which roll in from the Pacific Ocean. 
 
Our 100% natural Aztec corn creates the start of an exceptional liquor.  We use a 100% corn bill recipe for our sour mash and our fermentation tanks are not sealed so that the natural yeast in the environment blends with our starter yeast to produce a ﬂavour unique to Dorwart Whiskey. All of our products contain an all natural recipe, revealing the true essence of the hand-selected, local ingredients. After being distilled, the liquor goes into custom-charred, once used, French red wine, white oak barrels.  The Mexican sun and humidity naturally age our whiskey, just as the natural elements of the Dorwart family farm had done for the 'shine so many years ago. What’s left is something completely new and refreshing that we have introduced to the whiskey market?
 
The quality, rarity, and extra effort given to our corn will be evident when you taste Dorwart Whiskey.  Our whiskey is reminiscent of some of Kentucky's lighter bourbons with caramel overtones. It is fresh to the palate with a light, long-lasting finish.  No other whiskey has what Dorwart Whiskey has - Aztec corn, our age-old Prohibition era family recipe, and the natural elements of our home in Mexico. 

HELPING OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES - IT BEGAN WITH A DREAM
I was raised in Lampman Saskatchewan, Canada.  I spent my adult life building oil and gas plants and pipelines in Alberta, Canada.
My wife and I have been spending winter months over the past 10 years in a small fishing village, Boca de Tomatlán, 15 minutes south of Puerto Vallarta, Mexico.  We had fallen in love with this village, the people, their traditions and dreamed about retiring there, it was where we wanted to plant our feet for the rest of our lives. However, we weren't really ready to retire.  
My grandparents and father use to produce and market moonshine during the prohibition days.  My first experience at distilling began at the age of 11 and I continued with my passion through out my life.  We purchased a 100 litre stainless steel still from the United States, brought it to Boca de Tomatlán and began playing around with my family moonshine recipe, bourbon and sour mash recipes.  
After doing some research we had discovered that there weren't any whiskey distillers in Mexico. All whiskey products are imported into the country.  We saw an opportunity, well actually we saw a couple of opportunities.
The first opportunity is that people from around the world have purchased our whiskey products. We've been featured in a book written in the United Kingdom and approached by retailers to sell our products in Wal-Mart, Sam's and various liquor outlets in Puerto Vallarta.  Liquor distributors from the United States, Canada, India, China and across Mexico want to export and buy our Single Cask Whiskey.
This presents a GOOD problem, but a big problem, in that we just do not have the distilling capacity to meet the growing demand.  We have decided we DON’T want to remain a small business.
The second opportunity was our deciding factor.   Growing will give us the opportunity to provide something back to this village that we love so much.  Through the years we have done little things, quietly, but now it is time to do great things. We see an opportunity to provide jobs, bring more tourism into the village, funding for the schools, opportunities for the children to attend, finish and achieve further education through scholarships.  We saw an opportunity to encourage them to follow their dreams.  

WE NEED YOUR HELP
Becoming a Funding Partner isn't just about contributing to expand Mexico's first recognized whiskey distillery, it is an opportunity to provide jobs and giving children the opportunities that your children, our children and grandchildren have, fulfilling their dreams. 
Our goal is to raise $100,000.  Once we have reached our campaign goal,  5% of the funds received will be used to improve the education in the schools of Boca de Tomatlán.  But that’s just the start.  That kick start to growing our business means our commitment to 1% of net profits annually going to the same causes in our local communities.

<h3><strong>Frequently asked questions:</strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: What happens if we don't meet the $400,000 goal?</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>Q: Where does the money go?</strong></p>

A period ago I did not have a roof over my head or any friends  in the area that I had to move to. I had no drivers license due to the seizures from my lupus. I had no way to my Dr. appointments or the hospital.
I met Donald McWilliams He was so nice and wanted to help me knowing that I could not return the kindness he showed. He is a hardworking single dad, upstanding member of his community.

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>I'm a small developer looking for some money to make my small app TextFlick just a little bit bigger!</p>
<p>I'm a programmer whose been developing web apps for several years now. I know/am learning the languages HTML, CSS, PHP, MYSQL, bits of Python, Ruby, and Javascript.</p>
<p>I'm looking to create an app that will allow a person to send notifications via texts. You will also be able to send these text messages internationally. Along with these features you will be able to attach images and share them via texts in groups with family and friends. Unlike other texting apps, this app will allow users to send scheduled notifications, (e.g., ""Remember to buy eggs at 12:00."") in groups and also allows one to send and open a multitude of file types.  </p>
<p>With the money I make, I plan to hire a designer to completely redesign my site with a clean UI. I will also be able to develop a native app for Android, Windows 7, and iOS users. Along with that I will be able to hire a team of developers.</p>
<h2>What I Need</h2>
<p>I will need $10,000 for the project. Here is how I plan to use the money:</p>
<ul>
<li>I will need to hire a designer; and a team consisting of 2-3 developers.</li>
<li>I will need developer's licenses (iOS, Android)($150).</li>
<li>I need money pay for <a href=""http://www.twilio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twilio's</a> API</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>This is a great way to send texts affordably (free, actually) and internationally. It will also have some really cool features you can use </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>If you are unable to contribute that doesn't mean you can't help. Let others be aware of this upcoming app and feel free to post a link on facebook or on Twitter. Remember there are always the Indiegogo share tools to use.</p>
<p>If you just can’t contribute, that doesn’t mean you can’t help:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can help to make some noise about my app. Try it for free and let me know what you think on <a href=""%22http:/www.twitter.com/TextFlick"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Twitter</a> and/or on  <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/textflick"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook</a>.</li>

In October of 2011 I noticed that it had become increasingly more difficult for me to breath through my nose. I didn't think alot about it at first but when I got sick we went to see a doctor. They told me what I had but didn't refer me to see a specialist about my 'condition'. So we called Dr. Cepero and set up the next available date for an appointment. I went in a he looked for 2 seconds and told me what I had but that they were so severe that he couldn't put the micro camera in my nose to look so he set up a date for me to have a CT scan. I went to visit the doctor again a couple days after my scan. He told me what I had was called Allergic Fungal Sinusitis. He told me that I would need to see a specialist in Dallas and an allergist.</p>
<p>He also told me that the polyps that were blocking my nasal cavity had built up so much pressure that it has completely eroded the sinus wall between the cavity and the brain. He told me that it was common for small ammounts of erosion to happen but that my case was uncommon due to the severity of the erosion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>All I am asking for is a little help because the total cost of the surgery will be around $12,000. I'm just an 18 year old kid and I don't have that kind of money but the surgery needs to be done. I don't have a whole lot to give you but I will try and make it worth your time if you decide to donate. If you can't donate or don't want to donate, please at least take the time to share this with friends and family or on your facebook page or a youtube video. Thank you for your time.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Ryan Miller and I am the Founder of Hunters Helping Heroes, a Not-for-Profit Organization in New Jersey concentrating on helping our Nation’s heroes participate in outdoor retreats.</p>
<p>Operation Veteran Support has set its sights on raising money to send our Nation's Veterans on fully paid outdoors excursions. These events provide our Veterans with unique opportunities to experience the great outdoors and enjoy the tranquility and therapeutic atmosphere that nature provides them. Getting our Veterans out on events like these are the key elements to the success of this program and this is too important a resource to go unnoticed.</p>
<p>Your willingness to contribute will help us immensely; we are motivated and committed to making this a successful venture. These trips will have significant impact on the ability to take our ideas and create something tangible for our Veterans to experience.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Our goal for Operation Veteran Support is to meet or exceed the $1,500 mark. Every single penny donated to us will be used toward paying for an excursion so that no Veteran will pay anything out of pocket; it is our little way of saying thank you for your service and sacrifices. Whether we hit our goal or not, 100% of the money raised will go into paying for as many Veteran retreats as possible so that all they need to do is show up and have a great time!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Since we started Hunters Helping Heroes in 2010, we have sent out 30+ Veterans on excursions all over the U.S.A ranging from striper fishing here in New Jersey to duck hunting in Washington and even a few Southwest Texas whitetail hunts. We have catered to a few Purple Heart recipients and also Active Duty members, Reservists and Veterans who previously served. We are looking forward to making 2012 our biggest year yet and with your help, it will be!</p>
<p>Our biggest project we are working right now is the Picatinny Arsenal Wounded Warrior Hunting Program here in New Jersey. This program is for six (6ea.) Combat Wounded Veterans only. We will take them out into one of three (3ea.) specially constructed wheelchair friendly ground blinds on a hunting retreat where they are allowed access to base property that has never been hunted before to harvest a whitetail buck with archery equipment. This unique opportunity came from material and volunteer donations thanks to Home Depot and our 60+ volunteers who helped build and install these blinds over a two day period.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you cannot afford to donate to Operation Veteran Support you can still help us. Please spread the word about Hunters Helping Heroes and if you meet or know a Wounded Veteran or Servicemember who would like to go on a retreat with us, please send them to our website to contact us.

<h3>Who we are....</h3>
<p>The Used Bookstore in Downtown Chico is in danger of closing.</p>
<p>As manager of The Bookstore in Chico, California for the last 22 years, Josh Mills has developed a passion for books. He and his wife, Muir Hughes have both grown up in this community and now raise their children there.</p>
<p>After 37 years in operation, the owner decided it was time to retire and close up shop. The Mills family wished to keep the store open, giving a deposit to stop the closure. The remaining balance must be raised in the next 45 days to purchase the business and keep the doors open. The Bookstore is a tremendous resource that can't be lost!</p>
<p>Located in the heart of downtown, community arts and cultural events will be promoted as a new vision for the store with the focus remaining on providing a large selection of high quality used books. Literacy advocacy, regular children's story hour and poetry readings will be implemented. </p>
<p>This family of four are all artists. Josh Mills is a photographer, Muir Hughes is a textile artist and performance artist and both children aged 10 and 12 are visual and performance artists and actively collaborate within the community. With an opportunity to fully utilize the space, regular art events will take place showcasing artists in various mediums. They also have a vision for the underutilized back courtyard for small events, receptions and workshops.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Where will the money go?</h3>
<p>We need to raise a minimum of $35,000 to pay the balance on the business. This will allow the doors to remain open to the community. The Bookstore has been a valuable and prominent business for locals and tourists alike but has not been fully realized as a resource. With this funding, community involvement will increase.</p>
<p>This campaign features unique perks including rare signed books and original art. </p>
<p> <strong> </strong></p>
<h2><strong>What are the results?</strong></h2>
</div>
<div>
<p> </p>
<p>Your donation means The Bookstore is important to you and has the potential to continue to be an anchor in the community. In this changing world, bookstores offer something tangible and meaningful.  We love books and the environment a physical bookstore offers. </p>
<p>Now, perhaps more than ever, we need a place to explore, get lost in, get inspired by, and maybe slow down every once in awhile.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you want to see The Bookstore continue, please let people know about the store, the campaign, and spread the word. We will post updates about our progress. </p>

What are the results?


 
Your donation means The Bookstore is important to you and has the potential to continue to be an anchor in the community. In this changing world, bookstores offer something tangible and meaningful.  We love books and the environment a physical bookstore offers. 
Now, perhaps more than ever, we need a place to explore, get lost in, get inspired by, and maybe slow down every once in awhile.
 


Other Ways You Can Help
If you want to see The Bookstore continue, please let people know about the store, the campaign, and spread the word. We will post updates about our progress. 
Thank you sincerely,

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>A loving mother that gave so much of herself to her kids and the community is struck with one tragedy after another. Four years ago after moving away from her children in NJ to take care of her mother in FL. Her oldest son of 38 years dies of a sudden heart attack, than while preparing her son's funeral, her son-in law dies in a tragic motorcycle accident. After returning to Florida her step-father passes, and then her sister is struck with pancreatic cancer. The heart-breaks are tragic enough. Now she is faced with losing her own life. She has very little money and no health insurance, so she fights for her life. Just recently going through radiation treatment for cervical cancer, she now faces the possibly of blood cancer, leukemia, or even bone marrow cancer. Also, her diabetes has taken over; she has become legally blind, and has less than 30% of her kidneys. Not only does she face major health problems but financial crisis as well. Her car has broken down, her washer just fell apart, and she has to decide whether to eat or to get her medication each month. She can no longer be driven to the clinics or cannot attend the blind school for help. This wonderful woman is my mother and we all are trying so hard to help her out financially, but my husband is disabled as well and we have seven children so I can't do this on my own. We need a miracle to radically change my mom and dad's lives. My dad is on SSD, physically disabled with heart disease and Emphysema. He is taken care of my mom that best he can. My mom has given so much to others and has been through so much pain. But I fear that her “will” to press on is ceasing along with her health. Please help me to put a smile back on my mom's face by allowing her to not only pay for her medical expenses but have a car that runs good, and food on the table. She is the kind of women that would give you the shirt off her back and not even ask why. For years she has pulled homeless people off the streets, taken them in, and feed them. She has run outreaches for families in need and worked soup kitchens. But now she struggles to be able to complete the tasks God has called her to do. So I ask that we as a community give back and help my mom fight for her life. </p>

<p><span><strong>Your Dream are our Dreams</strong></span></p>
<p><span>As many of you viewing this campaign know, at EOB CrossFit we aspire to help others set and exceed goals they never thought possible. Our intent is to help change lives through mental and physical fitness. We strive to teach people to move better through practice and to create a fun environment of constant progress. Education is a primary goal for both coaches and clients. We stay true to these core values and strive to pass them in to everyone who enters our doors:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Community- It is important to us that we create a place where our members feel like extended family.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Generosity- No one can succeed without the generosity of others. We aspire to continually be giving.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Humility- There is always something to learn. We can always be better.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Passion- We have a passion for all that we do and all that you do. Without it we are empty.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Humble Beginnings </strong></span></p>
<p><span>EOB began with one member in a home garage in 2011.  Soon a small group of otherwise unlikely friends had started to convene a few times a week to train CrossFit. The group continued to grow until the driveway of the gated community home began to be suspiciously full a few days a week. Thats when EOB leased it's 2000 sq ft beachside home. Now, 2 years later, EOB is running classes seven days a week and many times members are spilling out into the parking lot to get a workout in. </span></p>
<p><span>Our amazing community deserves a facility that they can be proud of and comfortable in. A place that can support the ever growing goals and dreams of each of its members. The funds raised in this campaign will help outfit a new, larger state of the art facility.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Where will the money go?</strong></span></p>
<p><span>This expansion is not just about new shiny toys. Although there will be plenty of those. Its about generosity and helping others. Part of our excitement in growing as a community and business is our increasing ability to give back. With more space and equipment comes the opportunity to house more changed lives. With more changed lives comes more income to give our trainers thier dream jobs and more opportunity for charitable giving. EOB CrossFit will continue to donate to its charity of choice, <span><a href=""http://www.grassrootsgiving.info/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Grassroots Giving</a>.</span></span></p>
<p>We want to help others, but we want to make this effort worthwhile for you as well. This gym will be YOUR home. We are designing it with you guys at heart. We invite you to visit our gear registry at Rouge Fitness to view the list of equipment you can expect to see. View our dream blueprints to see sketches and examples of the plans we have been hard at work preparing for the next chapter. </p>
<p>We are planning for the next facility to be upwards of 5000 sq ft, to include much nicer amenities including showers and special areas. To give you a better idea where these funds are headed we expect flooring alone for a facility this size to cost some where around $13,000. Our bare minimum equipment shopping cart on Rogue is weighing in at $25,000. </p>
<p>Equipment Registry</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span><strong>What you get</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Everyone on every level deserves to be thanked. Every giver will have their name inscribed on a Thank You plaque to be hung in the gym. In addition there will be some pretty cool swag up for grabs.  Tee shirts will be limited edition, run only once and only available by supporting this campaign. Probably the most fun is the opportunity to become a part of our box permanently by having your name or even art concepts incorporated into our new decor! Claim a piece of equipment or a place on our wall as your own. </span></p>

<p><span><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></span></p>
<p><span>We understand that not everyone is in a position to help financially but that is not the only way you can help support us! Our members success stories have always been our most valuable asset. After all we have gotten this far on word of mouth alone. Keep it up! Please continue to tell your friends and family about Crossfit. Send them in for intros and let us show them our amazing community. And please, share this page as much as you can.

Probably the most fun is the opportunity to become a part of our box permanently by having your name or even art concepts incorporated into our new decor! Claim a piece of equipment or a place on our wall as your own.

 I'm Lydia Crowe, and I grew up in the country outside of Donnellson, a small town locally known as ""the heart of Lee County, Iowa."" It's a special place, and it's still close to my heart. Some people might think a rural community would be a dull place to grow up, but I have many happy memories of playing outside on the farm, hiking through the woods, and -- most of all -- going to the library.  
Why is a library so important to a rural community? All public libraries serve their communities in many ways, but rural libraries are especially busy because they're often one of the only public spaces in town. It's a place to check out books, but it's also a community center. It's a venue for local events and exhibitions, a safe and fun location for children and young adults to hang out after school, and a place where adults can socialize, get technology help, and participate in educational events. Best of all, it's free!


The Donnellson Public Library does all that and more. It's classified as a size B library, one that serves a population of less than 1,000. Of the 124 size B libraries in Iowa, the Donnellson Public Library ranks:


#1 in hours open 


#1 in adult circulations per capita


#4 in overall circulations per capita

#7 in young adult circulations per capita

It's plain to see that this community values its library! But nevertheless, the library's hurting. The building has inadequate space for all the people it serves -- and worse than that, it is literally falling apart. There are no other suitable buildings in Donnellson that the library could move into. That's why we're raising the funds to build a new library. 
What We Need




The new building will cost approximately $980,000. More than $200,000 has already been raised!
We are trying to raise $15,000 to contribute to the campaign.
Matching government grants are available to help push the library's building fund to its final goal. If we don't meet our goal, the library will still receive the funds -- but the project may be delayed.   The Difference You'll Make in Donnellson



Here's what you're paying for when you contribute to our building fund: 

Expanded Space for Books -- The library has to give away hundreds of books a year because there just isn't space for them. We'd all love a bigger selection, right?

Expanded Seating -- I know it's a small town, but two comfy chairs just isn't enough for a community of avid readers!

Increased Accessibility for Disabled Patrons -- Due to the settling and crumbling foundation, the current library's handicapped entrance is in disrepair and is not ADA compliant. The new library will be accessible to all patrons.

Community Space -- You won't have to be packed elbow-to-elbow anymore when you attend one of the many community events this library offers.

Energy Efficiency -- Geothermal energy, skylights, and windows will all reduce heating, cooling, and lighting costs in the new building.  
Technology -- More public computers and e-readers will mean a shorter waiting list to use them.

<div style=""padding-top: 5px;""></div>
<p>EEB is made from organic waste materials that are currently under-utilized as a potential source of renewable energy, including:<br/>
◆  sewage treatment biosolids<br/>
◆  agricultural by-products such as corn stover (corn stalks) and rice straw<br/>
◆  animal waste from ranches and dairies<br/>
</p>
<p>We have chosen to focus on making EEB first from biosolids, which is the leftover, dirt-like organic material that remains after a community's wastewater is treated.</p>
<p>Sewage treatment plants must currently pay to dispose of these ""waste"" biosolids, but when used as the basis for our EEB biofuel, they can be a valuable energy source.</p>

<p>Developing the EEB process using biosolids will set the stage for us to make EEB from all other organic waste materials.</p>
<p>Combined, these organic waste sources can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and dramatically lower our carbon footprint.</p>

<p>We can integrate EEB with our existing energy infrastructure by blending it with gasoline and diesel in existing engines.</p>

<p>EEB also has the potential to power an internal combustion engine on its own!</p>

<p>We have extensively modeled the cost of EEB at the commercial scale and found that it can be produced for less than $4 per gallon, without subsidies.</p>
<p>Because EEB can be burned cleanly, it can also produce renewable electricity for our energy grid.</p>

<p>The idea behind this technology was hatched in 2007.  At the time, Zack was working with Dr. James Smoot and they were writing grants to try to get all sorts of creative clean energy ideas funded.  That’s when the California Energy Commission decided to risk a small amount of money in the form of a 12 month grant to see if their EEB idea could be anything of interest.  After that grant ended, the National Science foundation funded another 12 months of research and EEB came to life. Years of research and development finally culminated in successfully running EEB in a Pontiac Solstice at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.</p>
<div style=""padding-top: 5px;""></div>

<p>In 2013, Zack moved back to Seattle after his wife's naturopathic residency in Indiana, and began searching for ways to move the EEB technology out of the garage and into a real lab space here in Seattle.  He met Todd, who was restarting his startup career after several years of caring for his special needs son.  Both of us are passionate about creating an environmentally and socially conscious company, and our backgrounds give us a great mix of engineering, marketing, and business skills.</p>
<p>We have talked with people in the wastewater treatment industry and learned that they are interested in producing EEB at their sewage treatment plants ... but first, we have to prove that we can scale up EEB production in our own laboratory, in real-world conditions.  That's where you come in!</p>

<p><b>Q:  Why crowdfunding?</b></p>
<p>A:  We are choosing to do crowdfunding as our first phase of fundraising because we want to partner with communities to maintain control over how the technology is rolled out and not have to sell this technology to the highest bidder. When we raise the money from people and communities who are concerned about the environment, then they become our funders and we are beholden to them. When communities begin demanding technologies such as ours then companies and cities will start to develop them and bring them to life through continued support. It is by creating a great relationship with our community that we are able to be a better Social Purpose Corporation and ensure what we do benefits the communities and world around us.</p>
<div style=""padding-top: 20px;""></div>
<p><b>Q:  What does EEB stand for?</b></p>
<p>A:  The letters E.E.B. stand for ""ethyl-3-ethoxybutyrate"", the chemical name for this renewable biofuel.</p>
<div style=""padding-top: 20px;""></div>
<p><b>Q:  What is a Social Purpose Corporation?</b></p>
<p>A:  We are registered in Washington State as a for-profit Social Purpose Corporation. This is a special type of company that is exactly as it sounds -- a company that follows a social purpose. We are legally able to make decisions based on things other than profit margins, such as benefits to the community and environmental impacts. This is done by embedding special language in our by-laws, ensuring that we stay committed to acting in the best interest of our employees, our community, and the planet.

EEB in a Nutshell





Using Organic Waste For Energy!

EEB is made from organic waste materials that are currently under-utilized as a potential source of renewable energy, including:
◆  sewage treatment biosolids
◆  agricultural by-products such as corn stover (corn stalks) and rice straw
◆  animal waste from ranches and dairies

We have chosen to focus on making EEB first from biosolids, which is the leftover, dirt-like organic material that remains after a community's wastewater is treated.
Sewage treatment plants must currently pay to dispose of these ""waste"" biosolids, but when used as the basis for our EEB biofuel, they can be a valuable energy source.


Biosolids create an amazing opportunity for renewable energy that is very cost-effective!

Developing the EEB process using biosolids will set the stage for us to make EEB from all other organic waste materials.
Combined, these organic waste sources can reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and dramatically lower our carbon footprint.



The potential EEB production from organic waste could generate enough energy to make the United States a net energy exporter!

Community-Powered Energy

By using biosolids as an energy source, every community already has the starting material to produce clean, affordable, renewable energy.




When communities generate their own energy from the organic waste sources all around them, they become more energy independent and create sustainable, family-wage jobs.
Energy is made where energy is used, and community self-reliance is the result!




EEB enables distributed energy generation at the community level.  Then, when enough communities come together to create their own energy, entire countries can develop an amazing array of energy generation centers.

From Fossil Fuels To Renewables

EEB is an ideal energy source to help us transition from a fossil fuel economy to a sustainable energy economy. It's carbon footprint is lower than fossil fuels by 70%.
We can integrate EEB with our existing energy infrastructure by blending it with gasoline and diesel in existing engines.



EEB blends up to 20% with gasoline and diesel

EEB also has the potential to power an internal combustion engine on its own!
In addition, our research shows that blending EEB with diesel results in a significant soot reduction in diesel truck exhaust.



EEB reduces soot by acting as an oxygenate for diesel, like ethanol does for gasoline

We have extensively modeled the cost of EEB at the commercial scale and found that it can be produced for less than $4 per gallon, without subsidies.
Because EEB can be burned cleanly, it can also produce renewable electricity for our energy grid.

The Missing Piece of the Climate Change Puzzle

There is no one perfect solution for battling climate change. We need to use all the tools at our disposal to replace the energy we currently generate from fossil fuels.



Climate change is a complex problem that requires integrated solutions. EEB complements other types of renewable energy, such as solar and wind, by producing energy 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.

Why We Can Do It

The idea behind this technology was hatched in 2007.  At the time, Zack was working with Dr. James Smoot and they were writing grants to try to get all sorts of creative clean energy ideas funded.  That’s when the California Energy Commission decided to risk a small amount of money in the form of a 12 month grant to see if their EEB idea could be anything of interest.  After that grant ended, the National Science foundation funded another 12 months of research and EEB came to life. Years of research and development finally culminated in successfully running EEB in a Pontiac Solstice at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.


In 2013, Zack moved back to Seattle after his wife's naturopathic residency in Indiana, and began searching for ways to move the EEB technology out of the garage and into a real lab space here in Seattle.  He met Todd, who was restarting his startup career after several years of caring for his special needs son.

What We Will Do With Your Contributions

This Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign will allow us to build a pilot EEB production facility where we can make larger quantities of biofuel to power a test vehicle, and demonstrate the economic and technical value of EEB.
In addition to the lab space itself, we will purchase all the necessary tanks, pumps, and processing equipment to successfully scale up this technology.
The biggest cost of this project is a chemical reactor, which will be about $50k, for the final step in the production process.

</p><p><br/></p><br/></div>","Hi there, my name is Jeff Harris and I am a young business owner with a background in natural food and living. 
I currently work at a Portland natural food market stacking apples, and chopping celery four days a week, ALONG with running my own business Aumbites. In my free time I enjoy yoga, hiking, dancing, cooking and spending time with my partner and friends. 

My campaign ""Aumbites Expansion"" has been created to spread awareness of my product and health-full living. The Aumbite paleo cookie is looking for a chance to please palettes beyond Portland Oregon! The money raised in this campaign is going to help me invest in the necessary machinery to get my cookie production levels up to a point where they could supply a higher volume and ultimately create a fruitful living for myself. 

Contributors to this campaign will assist me in lifting my business to the next level, helping me achieve a life goal and continuing to do the work I love and am passionate about! 
What We Need & What You Get
I am looking to raise $20,000 in the coming two months. This money will be used for:  a down payment on a cookie depositer. These machines can create a sheet of cookies in 15 seconds. They cost anywhere from 15K to 30K depending on size, quality, etc. I am also looking to buy a used fuel efficient vehicle to make deliveries in town and beyond. I would use about 5K on a down payment for the vehicle. I will also be using 15%-20% of the funds raised to spread awareness of the physical cookie via the campaign perks. These costs are from the manufacturing and shipping of the product. I want to get the Aumbite to people's mouths! Everyone deserves to try and be able to purchase this healthy product in their hometown. This is what my vision is all about. 
My perks include plenty of delicious cookies and hazelnut butters plus personalized thank you cards. 
If I do not reach my goal, my raised money will still go towards a cookie depositer  and a vehicle and spreading awareness of the cookie. 





  The Impact

My business supports and exemplifies healthy food, natural living and treats. By eliminating processed and artificial foods out of our diet we are helping heal the earth, the people and the local sustainable economy. Supporting my business is saying yes to organic/non-gmo foods,  paleo foods, natural living, high vibration and deliciousness.  

  

Challenges

Running your own business is no joke, and I have only seen the beginning. I am committed to the work and challenges ahead of me. I know it won't be easy, however I desire to create and work for myself and for something I believe in. 


  Other Ways You Can Help

If you can't donate the $10 minimum but really want to try the cookies, please send me an email at aumbites@gmail.com and we will work something out. I want everyone to have a chance to try my product.

<p></p></div>","WTF is PodShare? 
We're a
co-living space. 10 pods in a communal loft. We rent beds overnight for travelers. Your pod is your own personal
space, and we share everything else. Our building has a new owner who won't renew our lease as a co-living space. Consequently, we have to tear down the pods on Jan 1st and relocate in 2015.

At its
core, PodShare is more than beds rented by the night. PodShare is social travel, shared resources and experiences. 
After 3
years and over 4,000 podestrians at our Hollywood location, the pods
have to come down on January 1, 2015. We're looking for a new home. PodShare was built by travelers, and together we can continue to grow. We’re seeking funds for materials, labor, and startup costs for the next location. Anything you can contribute whether it's $1, $10, or $1000 is greatly appreciated.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>

We are very passionate about animal welfare because we believe that pets deserve equal amounts of love and care. The YWAC strives on a daily basis to not only spread love to the animals in the center but also ensure that the pets enter a safe and loving home upon adoption/fostering. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All the funds donated to our campaign will go straight to the center so that they can purchase supplies that are needed to run the foster program.  The supplies purchased are given to the foster parent/family so that there is not a financial commitment. As a donor, we greatly appreciate your donation no matter how small and we will be offering incentives to those who donate. Below are a few of the perks we are offering for your gracious donations:</p>

<p>Three Brothers' Distillery is a small startup distillery located in Chesapeake, VA which is opening to meet the growing demand for incredible craft and artisanal whiskeys in the Mid-Atlantic States. President and Owner, David Reavis, utilizes his passion for whiskey and love of history to create a fine craft rye whiskey and un-aged corn liquor. He also seeks to introduce the art and history of distilling to the residents of Virginia and North Carolina. Three Brothers' Whiskey’s mission is to provide quality products incorporating Virgina's long and rich distilling heritage to today’s and tomorrow’s marketplace.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>In today’s economy, the banks still haven't recovered from the 2008 banking crisis they created and are not ready to support the Whiskey Brotherhood. In order to realize our vision, we need you, your passion for great whiskey, and love of artisinal spritits to join us on our journey.</p>
<p>Your financial support will be used to buy our first production still and generate enough capital, along with the money we have already raised, to open our doors and bring the Whiskey Brotherhood to Hampton Roads!  We intend to buy a 300 gallon hybrid pot still from our good friends at Artisan Still Design. Stephen and his guys make the best stills in the business and do it for a lot less than the big manufacturers. This committment to quality and craftmanship is the same kind of raw spirit we plan to build into our products.</p>
<p><img alt=""Picture"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.threebrotherswhiskey.com/uploads/3/1/1/0/3110549/9179733_orig.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 100%;""/></p>
<p>We need to raise $100,000 dollars to get this outstanding still and the additional equipment to install it. With this still, we will be able to bring our whiskey, gin, and moonshine to you and others who share a love of craft whiskey and aritisinal spirits.</p>
<p><strong>What's In It For You</strong></p>

Three Brothers' Distillery is a small startup distillery located in Chesapeake, VA which is opening to meet the growing demand for incredible craft and artisanal whiskeys in the Mid-Atlantic States. President and Owner, David Reavis, utilizes his passion for whiskey and love of history to create a fine craft rye whiskey and un-aged corn liquor. He also seeks to introduce the art and history of distilling to the residents of Virginia and North Carolina. Three Brothers' Whiskey’s mission is to provide quality products incorporating Virgina's long and rich distilling heritage to today’s and tomorrow’s marketplace.
What We Need & What You Get
In today’s economy, the banks still haven't recovered from the 2008 banking crisis they created and are not ready to support the Whiskey Brotherhood. In order to realize our vision, we need you, your passion for great whiskey, and love of artisinal spritits to join us on our journey.
Your financial support will be used to buy our first production still and generate enough capital, along with the money we have already raised, to open our doors and bring the Whiskey Brotherhood to Hampton Roads!  We intend to buy a 300 gallon hybrid pot still from our good friends at Artisan Still Design. Stephen and his guys make the best stills in the business and do it for a lot less than the big manufacturers. This committment to quality and craftmanship is the same kind of raw spirit we plan to build into our products.

We need to raise $100,000 dollars to get this outstanding still and the additional equipment to install it. With this still, we will be able to bring our whiskey, gin, and moonshine to you and others who share a love of craft whiskey and aritisinal spirits.

<h1><strong>How did SkinnyMe Bangles come to be? </strong></h1>
<p>Well, exercising isn’t really my thing. Gyms intimidate me. And my Wii Fit died some time ago. I care about my health, but if I'm going to exercise I need something I can adopt easily. Many people feel the same way. So, SkinnyMe Bangles were born. </p>
<h1>
<strong>What exactly are SkinnyMe Bangles?</strong> </h1>
<p>They’re wrist weights, redesigned. The concept is the same. By wearing wrist weights, you can tone and strengthen your shoulders, biceps and triceps because your muscles are working against the resistance. Unfortunately, most wrist weights are ugly and bulky. </p>
<p>Because SkinnyMe Bangles look like jewelry, you can wear them often, for longer periods, and still reap the benefits.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h1><strong>Can I see some up close pics of the SkinnyMe Bangle? </strong></h1>
<p>Absolutely! These are the finished prototypes. We spent 10 months designing, testing, patenting, and finessing them. We’re so proud of the quality of the bangles, we’re etching our logo into each one. And at a 1/2 pound each, SkinnyMe Bangles are the same size as a standard bangle. </p>

<p>Friends Friends of Faire (FoF) was founded in 1998 and, with the help of Renaissance Entertainment Productions, numerous volunteers and limited income, the original meeting area (the FoF Garden) has been improved with additional tables and benches, a roofed pavilion, a new garden gate, wall and fence, and numerous plantings.  Our membership has grown from just a few over 400 full members in 2011 to just over 560 last season.  Without your help the FoF Garden would still be an area with a few picnic tables and minimal amenities.  Over the past few years we have opened the garden to any Faire goer willing to pay a $5 daily fee for use of the garden and amenities which include a shady and usually breezy place to rest with adequate seating, private privies, classes and entertainment, and unlimited filtered ice water and Gatorade.  Most folks who avail themselves of this privilege become full members the following year.</p>
<p>2013 is FoF's 15th birthday at Bristol and we are getting ready to take on the biggest project since the building of the pavilion - a nearly 1,000 square foot expansion of the garden and the building of a lockup,roofed amenities area and new gates and fencing.  The area on the <strong>drawing in gallery tab</strong> is the back of the garden. Bottom of drawing is South.  Except for an 8x16 area in the south-east corner, the entire current ""back of the garden"" will be available for member activities. </p>
<p>The largest expense for this project is the lockup.  That is $18,000.  We have been saving every cent we could over the past 4 years and still need $12,000.  This will give us funds to do the following:</p>
</div>
<ul>
<li>Build the 16x20 lockup to building inspector standards, with our own electricity and water.  The lockup will have a ""garage"" door at the back and a 30 year roof.  An 8 x 16 cedar shingled porch will cover the sink and gator/water dispensing area.</li>
<li>An instant hot water heater.</li>
<li>A separate, stand-alone sink next to the privies for handwashing.</li>
<li>New sink and prep tables</li>
<li>A built-in ice cooler for the filtered gatorade and ice water.</li>
<li>A roofed area for the privys, the THREE dressing/nursing rooms, the member storage area (keep), and hopefully a baby changing station and Diaper Genie.  This will be similar to the current pavilion, only smaller and we hope to re-use the canvas for the roof.</li>
<li>Benches and tables to provide seating in the expansion area.</li>

</div></div>","Friends Friends of Faire (FoF) was founded in 1998 and, with the help of Renaissance Entertainment Productions, numerous volunteers and limited income, the original meeting area (the FoF Garden) has been improved with additional tables and benches, a roofed pavilion, a new garden gate, wall and fence, and numerous plantings.  Our membership has grown from just a few over 400 full members in 2011 to just over 560 last season.  Without your help the FoF Garden would still be an area with a few picnic tables and minimal amenities.  Over the past few years we have opened the garden to any Faire goer willing to pay a $5 daily fee for use of the garden and amenities which include a shady and usually breezy place to rest with adequate seating, private privies, classes and entertainment, and unlimited filtered ice water and Gatorade.  Most folks who avail themselves of this privilege become full members the following year.
2013 is FoF's 15th birthday at Bristol and we are getting ready to take on the biggest project since the building of the pavilion - a nearly 1,000 square foot expansion of the garden and the building of a lockup,roofed amenities area and new gates and fencing.  The area on the drawing in gallery tab is the back of the garden. Bottom of drawing is South.  Except for an 8x16 area in the south-east corner, the entire current ""back of the garden"" will be available for member activities. 
The largest expense for this project is the lockup.  That is $18,000.  We have been saving every cent we could over the past 4 years and still need $12,000.  This will give us funds to do the following:


Build the 16x20 lockup to building inspector standards, with our own electricity and water.  The lockup will have a ""garage"" door at the back and a 30 year roof.  An 8 x 16 cedar shingled porch will cover the sink and gator/water dispensing area.
An instant hot water heater.
A separate, stand-alone sink next to the privies for handwashing.
New sink and prep tables
A built-in ice cooler for the filtered gatorade and ice water.
A roofed area for the privys, the THREE dressing/nursing rooms, the member storage area (keep), and hopefully a baby changing station and Diaper Genie.  This will be similar to the current pavilion, only smaller and we hope to re-use the canvas for the roof.
Benches and tables to provide seating in the expansion area.
Build new fencing and gates to enclose the expansion.
The usual painting and sealing and repairs.

<p>Our campaign is to help the children at R House become more stable and successful by creating an environment for teen recovery through personal empowerment. R House is a registered non-profit 501C (3) which
operates a licensed residential treatment center and charter high school for
youth. All contributions are considered unrestricted gifts and can't be
specified for any particular purpose, and will be used to serve the children by
funding our organization.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Help make a difference in the lives
of the children at R House!</b></p>
<p>R House has been serving youth for
more than 35 years. Many of the children who enter
our program come from disadvantaged families and communities, or many
times have no family. Our dual diagnosis facility offers a comprehensive
quality program that provides youth a stable caring environment to receive treatment to overcome
obstacles, including substance abuse and mental health issues.

</p><p>Our goal is to educate, support, and
serve foster children and at-risk youth in helping them grow to their full potential and become successful and fulfilled in their lives.  <br/><br/>
We provide adolescents with an education that
gives them tools to be successful in life, including academics and life skills. <br/><br/>
Our clinical services give individual treatment to children to address their needs. The specialized services combine with our onsite school and a structured residential setting to provide an abundance of opportunities to help teens in need.</p>
<p></p>
<br/><p><b>Here is a story from one of our
graduates:</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>My life at R House, By Christina Lile</b></p>
<p>I remember my first day at R House:
the sun setting as I was transported to the country, the silence in the car,
just the loud thumping of my heart racing. I remember in juvenile hall I
planned to jump out of the car at a stoplight before even making it to R House,
but I didn't. I don’t know if I was scared of jumping out of a moving vehicle,
or if common sense took over. I was nervous in an unfamiliar area with unfamiliar adults
supervising me. During the day I slept and there were girls from all over
California housed together, 24 girls. I was terrified, terrified of the
unexpected. I just wanted to go home, turn back the clock and start over. I was
not bad; I was just a hurt little girl inside. I thought I would never be able
to trust anyone, especially adults I did not know; I could not even trust my
mother. I felt abandoned by my mother when her parental rights were terminated and I
became a ward of the court.  </p>
<p>Group homes can be difficult, but I
can say that R House saved my life. At the time I hated it, but it kept me
safe. I learned to trust adults and create real bonds with girls my age who
have felt the pain I have experienced, feelings of loneliness and distrust. I
knew deep down that I was tired of living the destructive lifestyle I was
living before coming to R House: a 16-year-old truant from school, running away
from home and having no respect for myself or any positive goals ahead...
disloyal and disrespectful to the woman who brought me into this world, her
health deteriorating. I made a promise to myself that I would finish this
program for my mother. With each passing day it got easier and easier to be
here, to the point where I started calling R House “my home.” I felt out of
place when I went on home passes; I could not wait to come home and see my
mentors and friends. </p>
<p>The R House program has taught me
how to be patient, how to trust, how to realize my own self-worth and become
independent. Mentors who truly cared about me guided me before I could walk
tall on my own. I was so proud to get a job through the vocation services offered by R House. I worked as much as I could, and I loved it! I was able to
save $10,000 while working. I stayed at R House from December 2002 to January
2005. I remember around my 18th birthday, 2 months before leaving R House, I
begged my probation officer to stay longer. I was terrified to leave; I felt so
safe being there. He told me it was time to spread my wings and leave the nest.
I was upset! We started laughing together because during our first visit. I was arguing with him about
wanting to leave as soon as possible... and now I was crying and begging to
stay longer! </p>
<p>I wanted to give back to the place
that saved my life. Today I am employed by R House, and I am truly grateful to
be able to serve through this wonderful program. Although it is challenging to work with
these children; they have such tremendous pain. I am happy to be able to help
them become stable and grow. I wish you could feel the overwhelming love and
admiration I have for this program. </p>

Fellowship</span><br/></p><p>On February 1st, I will be heading to Johannesburg, South Africa, and Maputo, Mozambique to spend four months as  a fellow with <a href=""www.kiva.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kiva</a>.</p><p>As the video above describes,<strong> Kiva is a micro-financing nonprofit whose mission is to alleviate extreme poverty through connecting entrepreneurs in economically disadvantaged communities with willing lenders, like you or I.</strong>  </p><p>To make this lending possible, Kiva works with 230 field partners, or micro-finance institutions, in 73 different countries.  Because of the large size of this network, Kiva depends largely on volunteers and fellows, like me, to work in the field with Kiva's field partners.  As Kiva describes, “the <strong><a href=""http://www.kiva.org/fellows"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kiva Fellowship</a></strong> is an<strong> unpaid, volunteer position</strong> designed to increase Kiva's impact and to offer participants a unique insider experience to the world of micro finance”.  As a fellow, I will provide critical training, program software, and technical updates to field partners as well as ensure that processes are running smoothly and efficiently in the field.  Kiva Fellows remain to be the strongest connection between Kiva and its field partners and are an essential part of Kiva's success. </p><p></p><h3>Why Kiva?</h3><p>Growing up in a middle-class family of 6 children, money always held an intrinsic value to me, and birthdays didn't get much better than receiving a fresh-faced $100 bill.  I would save it to put towards a new bike, or some trivial material good that wouldn't actually make a difference in my quality of life.  However, after studying abroad in both Brazil and Indonesia, the meaning of money changed drastically.  The same amount of money that can buy me a new pair of running shoes in urban America can serve as two months' rent for a college student in East Java, Indonesia.  20 cents, which can't even get me a decent gumball at a diner, can mean the difference between having a nourishing meal and going hungry to a working mom in Jakarta.  I Kiva because by giving up my coffee habit for a week, I can invest $25 in an entrepreneur in need, and all too easily help them break above the poverty level and have a better quality of life.</p><p>Moreover, while working to alleviate poverty in Los Angeles' most disadvantaged community on Skid Row, I was exposed first-hand to the lack of financial resources available to those living in poverty, decidedly the ones who need them the most.  With Kiva, these financial resources are made available to the most impoverished areas of the world, having a direct impact on combatting global

</ul></div>","The Kiva FellowshipOn February 1st, I will be heading to Johannesburg, South Africa, and Maputo, Mozambique to spend four months as  a fellow with Kiva.As the video above describes, Kiva is a micro-financing nonprofit whose mission is to alleviate extreme poverty through connecting entrepreneurs in economically disadvantaged communities with willing lenders, like you or I.  To make this lending possible, Kiva works with 230 field partners, or micro-finance institutions, in 73 different countries.  Because of the large size of this network, Kiva depends largely on volunteers and fellows, like me, to work in the field with Kiva's field partners.  As Kiva describes, “the Kiva Fellowship is an unpaid, volunteer position designed to increase Kiva's impact and to offer participants a unique insider experience to the world of micro finance”.  As a fellow, I will provide critical training, program software, and technical updates to field partners as well as ensure that processes are running smoothly and efficiently in the field.  Kiva Fellows remain to be the strongest connection between Kiva and its field partners and are an essential part of Kiva's success. Why Kiva?Growing up in a middle-class family of 6 children, money always held an intrinsic value to me, and birthdays didn't get much better than receiving a fresh-faced $100 bill.  I would save it to put towards a new bike, or some trivial material good that wouldn't actually make a difference in my quality of life.  However, after studying abroad in both Brazil and Indonesia, the meaning of money changed drastically.  The same amount of money that can buy me a new pair of running shoes in urban America can serve as two months' rent for a college student in East Java, Indonesia.  20 cents, which can't even get me a decent gumball at a diner, can mean the difference between having a nourishing meal and going hungry to a working mom in Jakarta.  I Kiva because by giving up my coffee habit for a week, I can invest $25 in an entrepreneur in need, and all too easily help them break above the poverty level and have a better quality of life.Moreover, while working to alleviate poverty in Los Angeles' most disadvantaged community on Skid Row, I was exposed first-hand to the lack of financial resources available to those living in poverty, decidedly the ones who need them the most.  With Kiva, these financial resources are made available to the most impoverished areas of the world, having a direct impact on combatting global poverty levels.  I am very excited to use my extensive training background to serve Kiva's field partners in South Africa and Mozambique, creating a more efficient lending cycle and ensuring critical financial resources to over 2,500 borrowers in need.Who will I work with?As a Kiva Fellow, I will spend 3 months working with Hluvuku-Adsema, a micro-finance institution in Maputo, Mozambique.  Although Mozambique's economy has been largely improving over the last couple of years, Mozambique remains to be one of the poorest countries in the world.  Hluvuku has 8 branches in the Maputo area and since partnering with Kiva, has provided over 2,500 loans to borrowers in need in order to combat poverty levels in this part of the country.  To learn more about how Kiva loans have impacted Hluvuku clients, please click here.I will also spend 1 month of my Kiva fellowship working with Maharishi Institute in Johannesburg, South Africa, a vocational educational institute that provides critical training and work experience to students. This greatly strengthens students' marketability in a country where the unemployment rate has stubbornly plateaued around 25% in the past few years.  (To learn more about South Africa unemployment rates, click here.)  Kiva partners with Maharishi to provide micro-loans to students, helping combat the cycle of generational poverty and allowing them access to a higher education and eventually, stable employment.  To learn more about Maharishi students that are positively impacted by Kiva's loans, please click here. How can you join the cause?After talking to past Fellows in the region and doing extensive research, my estimated budget for my fellowship will be at least $6,000 for my 4 months in Africa.  This estimate includes airfare, in-country transportation to visit borrowers/field offices, visa costs, required vaccinations, and food and accommodations, among other costs. The budget breakdown is as follows: 
Airfare: $1,500
Accommodations for 4 months: $2,500

Attendees are encouraged to put flyers, brochures and business cards on the “Table of Shameless Plugs” to help spread the word about their doings - we are big fans of sharing and support! There is also a Raffle of Fabulous Prizes <tm> featuring delicious offerings from all over the Tarot world, the proceeds of which go to various local and national charities, including bat conservation groups.  
The SF BATS Programme is at the printer, so although our gratitude for contributions made after August 12th  is every bit as deep, those names will not be included.

<h1><strong><strong><strong>Q: What is the concept for the collaboration?</strong></strong></strong></h1></span><strong>A: </strong>There are hair and nail salons where you can get your hair done; boutiques for buying clothing and home goods; and lounges or cafe's where you can have drinks with your friends. Su'juk weaves facets of these distinct environments together to create a lifestyle boutique offering one extraordinary experience!<p></p>
<p><img alt=""Our Idea!"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/726/703/4e1641161ff5b483387fa320be30362a_large.jpg?1373216633"" src="""" style=""""/>Our Idea!</p>
<p></p>
<h1><strong>Q: Who is Su Beyazit?</strong></h1>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I'm Su Beyazit; I currently own a clothing and home goods store called Su'juk in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, New York. I was born in Adana, Turkey, a region just above the eastern Mediterranean. I left Turkey at the age of five and spent the rest of my youth in North Carolina in a non-traditional Turkish-American household. In the summer of my junior year in high school, I attended Rhode Island School of Design and finished a prestigious summer program focusing on Fashion illustration which led me to attend Parsons The New School For Design in New York City. I graduated college in 2010 with a degree in sustainable Fashion Design. After college I worked as a stylist and continued selling vintage online which led me to opening my own boutique in the fall of 2012. You can find out more about my personal work at <a href=""http://www.subeyazit.com/SU_BEYAZIT/HOME.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.subeyazit.com</a>.</p>
<h1><strong>Q: Who is Elena Ruiz?</strong></h1>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I'm Elena Ruiz, and I've been a hair colorist for 10 years, working both in Beverly Hills and New York City. At the age of 19, I received my cosmetology license at Paul Mitchell, Cosmetology School. Within the first three years of my graduation, I worked at two prestigious salons in Beverly Hills, California: Giuseppe Franco and Umberto. Eager to take my career to the next level, I decided to move to New York where I set my goal for the city's top celebrity salon for color, Rita Hazan. During my five years at Rita Hazan, I worked frequently with clients including: Jennifer Lopez, Thalia, and Jessica Simpson. My signature style hones in on a client's unique natural beauty and enhancing it with with a look that is at once sexy and sophisticated.</p>
<h1><strong>Q: What is the reason to expand the current Su'juk space?</strong></h1>
<p><strong>A:</strong> I’ve had my current space for almost a year and I can feel the need for expansion and growth. I’ve partnered up with Elena to create a lifestyle boutique that’s a fun, relaxed venue where you can take care and beautify yourself and your home in an environment that is more social than traditional salons or boutiques. We're striving to re-make the way we shop for ourselves and our homes. Our first step towards this is expanding our home goods and furniture products by partnering up with <a href=""http://nomadictrading.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Nomadic Trading Company.</a> Step two is transforming part of the boutique to comfortably offer designer hair cuts, color, brow shaping, manicures and pedicures in a neighborhood that currently lacks a Salon that cater to the 20-40 young and mid-career professionals, students, and artists that make this community what it is.</p>
<h1><strong>Q: Why do you need this much money?</strong></h1>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Our vision requires more space than what my current boutique, Su'juk, offers. Most of the spaces we've looked at would need to be built from the ground up. The creative freedom we would have excites us, but it also requires great care and a huge up-front investment. The initial work includes: breaking down walls, adding track lighting, buying paint and wood to build all of our display cases, racks and salon space. We also need help covering our awning and creating additional signage + a applying for a salon license. Any additional money (if we have any) will go towards buying new merchandise for the store.</p>
<p>Here is a Pie Chart of how the money will be distributed:</p>

<h1>Q: What kind of services will the Salon be offering?</h1>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We will initially offer hair color and styling by Elena Ruiz; Gel manicures by Mei Kawajiri; and men's grooming by Josh Livingston. We will eventually add a women's hair cutter, a makeup artist and eyebrow groomer. This will take some time however we plan on offering a full salon service for women and men!</p>
<h1><strong>Q: Do you plan to ship internationally?</strong></h1>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Sure do! Please just add an additional $8 dollars for international shipping!!</p>
<h1><strong>Q: What are some of the incentives offered? <br/></strong></h1>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We have an exciting array of fun gifts to treat yourself to! Donors can choose from: personalized USA state charm bracelet, a free blow out, keratin treatment, a gel manicures by Mei; or a color job (highlights, ombre or full head) by Elena!

<h2 class=""dotty""><span>Risks and challenges</span></h2>
<p>Our main challenge right now modifiying our current space or finding a space big enough, in a good part of the neighborhood, that's in our budget! We have given many local business and friends the low down of what we are interested in. So we have many eyes out for us:) As of now we have only found 1-2 spaces that meet that criteria. That said, we don't want to settle on any location since we plan on being there for a long time. However we are also negotiating a deal with our current landlord to expand our current space. In that case we will break down walls and revamp the space to be both a boutique and salon!</p>
<p>Another challenge for us is construction. One of the main spaces we are interested in needs a lot of modular work. So we are trying to figure out how to build out a space that can be the most economical. We are interested in making it look amazing but we also know that we can always over time improve aesthetics. So our main goal is to make it function and capture the essence of the concept!

Historical Memory ProjectMy name is Ebony Pleasants. I
have been involved in social justice work and advocating for youth, women, LGBTQ, survivors of abuse and
the homeless since I was 15 years old. I am currently in El Salvador, volunteering for Voices on the Border; a US
nonprofit organization
dedicated to promoting just and sustainable development in El Salvador. The Objective: To raise support and funds for the invaluable process of collecting and reconstructing the historical memory of a community that has lived through many trials and tribulations. Stories of extreme poverty, war, exile and collective development will be shared, heard and used to create a book, a digital library and a video documentary. The community will work together to lead this project, emotional supportive resources will be available throughout and in the end the community will have practical materials it can use to demonstrate the past and educate the future.Three Methods of Memory Collection:
Personal Testimonies
Collective Memory Workshops
Material Archive
Community-led Commissions:
Workshop Facilitators

Interviewers
Archival
Emotional Support
Youth
PROJECT DEADLINE: NOVEMBER 2014 (25th Anniversary of the return from exile)1. Follow the Money 
$1,500
5 Collective Memory Workshops (Meals and Materials)

4 Emotional Support Workshops (Transport, Meals and Materials)

Voice Recorders ($$ or Donations)

Post-Production Committee (Meals and Materials)
Publishing of the book with Equipo Maiz in El Salvador

It's important to demonstrate each and every act of solidarity and for that reason we will mention your generous support on our finished material. If we don't reach our goal we will use what has been donated to ensure the continuation of the process. Going beyond our goal will allow us to increase the community involvement, offer them more opportunities to reflect and amplify the distribution.2. The Social ImpactsThis is more than a project for the production of media. The impact
of memory work can have a variety of effects on survivors when they
choose to remember and publicly document, assess and recognize the past
and the particularly violent acts that have violated international
humanitarian law and human rights.The reconstruction of historical memory has
the potential to rebuild social networks and facilitate the healing
process through contributing to the psychosocial well-being of the
community. Allowing different voices to describe and explain the history of facts can help identify the responsible parties, what happened and (at times) the reasons which hopefully has the potential to eliminate a survivor's guilt.Rebuilding history allows recovery of the biographies of the dead and the rescuing of their dignities.3.

 Es importante demostrar a todos y cada acto de solidaridad y por eso vamos a mencionar su generoso apoyo en nuestro material terminado. Si no llegamos a nuestro objetivo vamos a utilizar lo que se ha donado para asegurar la continuación del proceso. Yendo más allá de nuestro objetivo nos permitirá aumentar la participación de la comunidad, les ofrecemos más oportunidades para reflexionar y ampliar la distribución.Esto es más que un proyecto para la producción de medios de comunicación. El impacto del trabajo de memoria puede tener una variedad de efectos en los sobrevivientes, cuando optan por recordar y documentar públicamente, evaluar y reconocer el pasado y los actos particularmente violentos que han violado el derecho humanitario internacional y los derechos humanos. 2. Los Impactos Sociales 

La reconstrucción de la memoria histórica tiene el potencial para reconstruir las redes sociales y facilitar el proceso de curación a través de contribuir al bienestar psicosocial de la comunidad. Permitir que diferentes voces para describir y explicar la historia de los hechos puede ayudar a identificar a los responsables, lo que pasó y (a veces) las razones que se espera tenga el potencial de eliminar la culpabilidad de un sobreviviente. La reconstrucción de la historia permite la recuperación de las biografías de los muertos y el rescate de sus dignidades.3. Otras maneras de ayudar

</div><h2>Our Campaign</h2>Freelance Photographic is a small Edinburgh based photography company run by Matthew Crisp and Robin Jeffries, two photographers with over 12 years of combined experience in art photography.<br/><p>We’re looking for a little financial assistance to start something we’re calling “FP:Teach” - an initiative aimed at getting the Edinburgh community more in touch with the photos they’re taking. These days a photo has become a throw-away thing - something to post on Facebook and then forget about - but we don’t think this is how things need to be. A photo can be a work of art and something to be proud of. Imagine if all your Facebook photos were like this. Imagine printing and hanging your own work on your living room wall, or even being approached by friends and family for prints of your art.</p><br/><p>Simple costs like rent, stationery and educational materials for our courses need to be paid up front before we can start running FP:Teach as a viable project, so we thought we’d ask you guys for help. In return we’ll give you all something to show for your generous donations. Be it a voucher for some of our excellent courses or a piece of beautiful artwork for your home; you’ll be getting something well worth your money and we’ll be one step closer to our goal of brightening the Edinburgh community with new skills and creativity. Not to mention helping keep this beautiful art form alive through the digital age.</p>  <br/><br/><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><br/><p>We’ve worked out that all we need to get ourselves off the ground is £800 to pay for educational handouts, studio rent and insurance to run our classes. As a stretch goal, we have a target budget of an additional £400 to pay for advertising material throughout the city and in local media in order to spread the word. None of the money you donate will go towards paying ourselves. We just need to raise the start-up capital to get this project underway.</p><br/><p>As a thank you for your contributions to our work, we’re offering a selection of hand-signed framed prints of your choice from our portfolio, as well as postcards, canvas prints and even a framed monster print for our first donation exceeding £150! For our backers in and around the Edinburgh area, we’re offering bundle packs of our photography courses, allowing you to come along and fuel your creative side at a significant discount on the standard rates! Please note that our classes will be held in Central Edinburgh and your own transport will need to be arranged!</p><br/><p>Know someone with a passion for photography? Why not feed their fire by buying them a voucher for our classes?

<h2>The issue is that we do not have a meeting-point to share
our divergent thinking ideas and designs, a place where we can find supporters,
producers or investors for our proposals and innovative suggestions.</h2>
<h3>Our current social structure, is based on companies. So to
accomplish our aims, we have to speak the language of commerce, we have to sell
our ideas in a store. On display in that store will be concepts and ideas that
could be useful to business owners and marketers. People who want to grow their
business, break into new markets and launch innovative new products that make a
social impact.</h3>
<h2>The “Divergent Store” will become an online meeting point,
where designers who create innovative product prototypes and services will come
together with producers/investors/companies that share the same vision of
making a positive social impact. This online global platform will also be
accessible to anyone interested in finding out about divergent ideas and
socializing through them.</h2><h2>The mission is to inspire the creation of new projects and
brief life into old ones in topics that we support. We will get those product
prototypes on to the market and use them as tools to enrich Education and
support the Arts on a whole new global way. </h2><h2>The shared philosophy of the investors and the product
creators using this store, will be a wish to make a positive social impact.</h2>
<h2>How will the Divergent Store work?</h2>
<p>There will be two major activities/sections on the Store:</p>
<h2>1. “Competitions”</h2>
<p>A Production company may
publish on the Divergent Store a brief about a need that they have. Creators
will receive notifications about new briefs and will be invited to post their
“proposals”. The best proposal will be the winner of the “Competition” and
his/her proposal will be sold to the producer in order for it to move into
production. The Divergent Store creative team will assist creators through this
process. </p>
<h2>2. “Showroom” </h2>
<p>At the “Showroom” we will showcase ideas and product
prototypes by creators from all around the world after having gone through a
process of selection and improvement by our team of experts. Here proposals
from Competitions will also be showcased. Finally, we will make the
communication between them and the right production companies of our network.</p>
<h2>Final Goal:</h2>
<h3>Basic Divergent
Organization structure, Inspiring-Teaching-Directing-Hosting-Helping Culture to
thrive</h3>
<p>Our final goal is to become
a widely recognized Creative Organization that will drive Creators, Companies
and Buyers <i>Divergently</i> to the betterment of society, as a <i>Marketing
tool, an Educational platform and a Research and Development department.</i></p>
<p>We aspire to re-design
the product development process. People will work and educate themselves while

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<div>
<p>I founded Buddha's Belly Smoothie Cafe after being a raw vegan for the past 2 years. Changing my diet changed my life- it made me happier, healthier, and gave me more passion for life. About 6 months ago, I decided that I wanted to dedicate myself to bringing health and awareness to as many people as possible.</p>
<p>Denver is a perfect place for a raw, vegan restaurant since SO many people are vegan and enjoy eating healthy food! Everyone I talk to about Buddha's Belly Smoothies is so passionate about the mission because they realize that we desperately need a restaurant like this in Denver.</p>
<p><strong>Our goal:</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to bring the most delicious, healthy food to people that are on the go. Instead of being a sit-down restaurant, we decided to brand ourselves as a ""fast food"" cafe and smoothie bar. We realize that restaurants like McDonald's and Burger King are extremely popular for people with busy, hectic lifestyles- but when people eat such unhealthy food, they are not able to perform to their highest ability. We want Buddha's Belly to be able to compete with these fast food chains, while at the same time only delivering organic, raw, vegan, gluten and soy free, and non-GMO food.</p>
<p>Food quality and health are our HIGHEST priorities. Buddha's Belly will never sacrifice the quality of the food we serve in order to bring down prices or add to the taste of our food. We believe that organic, raw food brings out the most delicious flavors, and no added fillers or preservatives are ever needed!!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><span>We need $10,000 for the following items:</span></p>

</div>

<ul>
<li>Professional Food Dehydrator</li>
<li>Juicers</li>
<li>Blenders</li>
<li>A fridge</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>The reason why the goal is set to only $7,000 is because if we get less than $10,000 we will take out a loan to pay for the rest and we did not want to risk us not reaching our goal. But if we could raise $10,000 in 15 days, that would be amazing!</p>
</div>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Buddha's Belly is a company dedicated to bringing healthy, farm-to-table, Non GMO food to its customers. By supporting us, you will be welcoming a new business to Denver that will strive every day to bring awareness to health, nutrition, permiculture, and eco-concious living.</p>

<p>A lot of folks, especially millennials, are
finding meaning and belonging outside traditional religious communities. In
April 2015, we published <a href=""https://caspertk.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/how-we-gather.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">How We Gather</a>, a report about the rise of
new forms of community that are helping us to live better lives. The reception
was fantastic - we even got covered in the <a href=""http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/human-contact-for-the-digital-age-loner/?_r=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">New York Times</a>! </p>
<p><span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></span></p>
<p>The best part of
the project has been getting to know the folks leading these innovative

to help make that happen. </p>

A lot of folks, especially millennials, are
finding meaning and belonging outside traditional religious communities. In
April 2015, we published How We Gather, a report about the rise of
new forms of community that are helping us to live better lives. The reception
was fantastic - we even got covered in the New York Times! 

The best part of
the project has been getting to know the folks leading these innovative
communities. And the more conversations we have, the more we realize how
much the leaders want to be in conversation with each other. So we've decided
to help make that happen. 

This November, we're
bringing together 40 community leaders from around the country - to
share with each other what they've learned, what they're struggling with, and
how they might collaborate. 

Some of these
communities are well known and have the ability to sponsor travel. Others are
less financially secure and need our help to bring their leaders to
Boston. We believe passionately in the work they're doing for us all.
We hope you'll join us in supporting it!

What We Need



We need two things to make this gathering happen:


Local hosts for guests from out of town - sign up here!
Money to subsidize travel costs for community leaders
who have requested help. 

A big thanks to The Crestwood Foundation, Ryan, and HDS for
putting in place the necessary finances for food, space, and all the materials
for the gathering. Thanks to The Crestwood Foundation, all donations are tax-deductible. We're so grateful!

The Possibilities

We don't yet know
what will come out of this gathering. It may end up being a one-time meeting.
It may be that these groups are too different to be of value to one another. Or
they might thread together to form the new community fabric in our country. At
the very least, we know how much the leaders want to be with others doing
similar work. 

Leadership is
lonely and the challenges each community faces are big: How do they survive

<div>I'm Susie Johnson.</div><div><br/></div><div>
<p>It has taken me seven children to realize that moms are
missing something. We are missing a resource that would benefit all of us.</p>
<p>There are plenty of platforms out there.</p>
<p>Plenty of sites out there that show you how to make the
perfectly decorated house. The perfect meal. The perfect wardrobe. The perfect
birthday party. The perfect child. The perfect… EVERYTHING.</p>
<p>But there aren’t many that let you know that nothing about
life is perfect. That it’s very often messy and challenging and overwhelming.</p>
<p>That’s why I first started Not Your Average Mom. I wanted to
write some funny stuff to 1) let moms know that it’s okay for your life to be
completely imperfect, and 2 ) to share 
stories about my failures and challenges as a mother, wife, and human
being so that moms (and dads) would know that they are not alone in their
struggles.</p>
<p>There aren’t a whole lot of websites out there that do that. That paint an accurate picture of parenthood and life in general. </p>
<p>So I’ve succeeded in accomplishing that!</p>
<p>Now I want to take care of the other stuff!</p>
<p>You know what’s missing from the internet?</p>

<div>This place reassures you that you are not alone in your struggles.

<p>But now I want to give you more.</p>
<h2>Because motherhood shouldn't just be about survival. </h2>
<p>We shouldn't just be striving to make it through the day.</p>
<div>I want to build a place where moms have resources... and plenty of them.</div><div><br/></div>
<div>Moms <b>need </b>resources. <i>All </i>moms. Young moms, old moms, expectant moms, moms of 1, moms of 10, moms of young kids, and moms of older ones. </div><div><br/></div>
<div>Moms need a relatable place to go where they can get reassurance that they are doing enough. But they also need resources to be able to do better.</div><div><br/></div>
<div>Because sometimes you just want to know your kids are not the only ones pulling their own poop out of their pants, other times you could really use some advice from another mom, and other times what you <i>really</i> need is an expert.</div><div><br/></div>
<div>Moms need a place where they can laugh, cry, get help, share ideas, and where they can find ways to give their families what they need while also keeping themselves on the priority list.</div><div><br/></div>
<div>Because when they can do all that, then they will really have all the tools necessary to be the moms they envisioned themselves being before all the not-so-pretty, unexpected, and unpredictable realities of motherhood set in!</div>
<h2>Your small investment will make this a reality.</h2>
<div>By investing in this campaign, we will build a seriously kick ass platform. We will give you and every other mom a one-stop site that not only entertains and reassures, but that teaches  and guides, and educates and connects. <b><i>An authentic place</i></b> that gives us an abundance of tools to improve the quality of our families' lives and our own.</div><div><br/></div>
<div>Your investment into Not Your Average Mom is an investment into your sanity, yourself and your family. </div><div><br/></div><div>Your investment into this campaign will give you access to the things you <i>need. </i>Its whole entire mission is<i> </i>to help you and every other mother like you to truly <b>enjoy </b>motherhood instead of merely survive it.</div>
<h2>Where does your contribution go?</h2>
<div></div>
<p>Your contribution directly facilitates the development of the new NYAM platform, which will allow for the access of all of the brand new NYAM resources to anyone and everyone. It enables the gathering of resources, educational tools, professional &amp; expert advice, and it empowers us to launch from a place of usefulness and value.</p>
<p>The current Not Your Average Mom site simply <b>cannot </b>support the vision for the platform. So, it's time to grow.</p><p>And growth requires investment. It requires saying goodbye to the old and making space for the new.</p>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></div>
<h2><span style=""background-color: initial;"">So what will your investment give you?</span></h2>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Remember your first time reading one of my posts? </span><br/>
</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>Remember what made you <i>love </i>NYAM— the honesty, the laughs, the comfort of knowing you aren't alone in any of your experiences?</div><div><br/></div>
<div>All of that same stuff that made you fall in love with Not Your Average Mom will still always be there. It's what makes the site what it is, and the <i>last </i>thing I would ever want to do is change that.</div><div><br/></div>
<div>This new platform is going to take everything that NYAM already is, and take it to <b>the next level. </b>
</div><div><b><br/></b></div>
<div>Easier navigation, community forums, expert financial advice, meal planning advice, fitness courses, webinars, parenting advice, not losing your mind advice, book clubs, a store full of useful products that will make life better and easier. </div><div><br/></div>
<div>Honestly, once the new platform is built, the sky is the limit. I'll be able to provide you with just about anything you need to make this journey through motherhood easier.</div>
<div><h2>How can you help?</h2></div>
<div>The most impactful way you can help is to invest! There are lots of great perks available to you for your investment! Check them out!</div><div><br/></div>
<div>And if you're not in a position to invest, I'm <i>certain </i>that you know someone who could use this platform. In fact, I'm sure you know many people who could. </div><div><br/></div>
<div>So if you can't invest, I'd strongly encourage you to spread the word! The more people we get behind this, the more expansive and helpful the platform will be for you and other parents everywhere!</div><div><br/></div>

</div>","Hi!

I'm Susie Johnson.
It has taken me seven children to realize that moms are
missing something. We are missing a resource that would benefit all of us.
There are plenty of platforms out there.
Plenty of sites out there that show you how to make the
perfectly decorated house. The perfect meal. The perfect wardrobe. The perfect
birthday party. The perfect child. The perfect… EVERYTHING.
But there aren’t many that let you know that nothing about
life is perfect. That it’s very often messy and challenging and overwhelming.
That’s why I first started Not Your Average Mom. I wanted to
write some funny stuff to 1) let moms know that it’s okay for your life to be
completely imperfect, and 2 ) to share 
stories about my failures and challenges as a mother, wife, and human
being so that moms (and dads) would know that they are not alone in their
struggles.
There aren’t a whole lot of websites out there that do that. That paint an accurate picture of parenthood and life in general. 
So I’ve succeeded in accomplishing that!
Now I want to take care of the other stuff!
You know what’s missing from the internet?
A website that helps us navigate all aspects of parenting
without making you feel like a complete failure or total dumbass.
There are plenty of websites showing you perfection.
But how many entertain and reassure
you while also offering you realistic, manageable, reasonable solutions?
Um….
NONE!
And that is the impetus for this Indiegogo campaign.
But first, a little bit more about who I am.

I'm a 47-year-old mom, stepmom, wife, divorcee, daughter, sister, coach, business woman, runner, writer, blogger, mental health advocate, failure and success, all wrapped into one.
I have a lot of kids but I'm not super religious. I'm a former elementary school teacher, but I enjoy using the f-word. A lot.
I'm married but I've been divorced. I love to laugh but I've been hospitalized for depression (more than once).
I know what it's like to file for bankruptcy, be on food stamps, and almost lose a home to foreclosure, but I've also raised over $30,000 for charity.
There have been highs and lows and I've shared them all. 
For the past four years I have been examining, contemplating, broadcasting, enjoying, surviving, and navigating these ups and downs of my life with seven kids at not-your-average-mom.com.
What started out as an idea and a desire to create an open, honest and fun outlet for moms has grown into something bigger than I had ever imagined.
In four years, the Not Your Average Mom Community has grown from a small audience of less than 100 people made up of my close family and friends, to almost 1 million readers last year.

And now we're taking it to the next level.

Why?
Because being a mom is f***ing hard.
Because there are plenty of websites out there that show you how perfect your life could  look on the outside and how other moms from all over the place seemingly have picture-perfect lives on the internet.

But most moms aren't looking for perfection. Quite often, we are looking for a place where we feel we belong.

And that's why Not Your Average Mom has become so popular. Because I prefer to show it and tell it like it is. I like to talk about the good and the bad. 

The pretty:

and the ugly:

I talk about these moments:

But I also talk about these:


Because I think it's so important that we all know we are not alone in the bad and the ugly. Because so often we all think that we are.


If you're a mom who has ever contemplated getting in the car and driving far, far away for, um, EVER, then you may have already landed on the Not Your Average Mom site.

And if you have landed on the site, you know that this is a site for the real mom. The mom who loves her kids to death but who also questions her parenting abilities. The mom whose goal is sometimes (or often) just to make it to bedtime. 
This place reassures you that you are not alone in your struggles. That there are plenty of other moms out there who haven't showered for days, whose sinks are always full of dishes, who can't remember the last time they brushed their kids' hair (or teeth), and whose kids are not the only ones still wearing a Pull Up to bed at night when they are in first grade.
Now, with your help, we can do so much more.

The new platform will provide moms with more resources. Real resources. To help you not just make it through the day, but to enjoy it. Or at least part of it.


I have provided you with a place to come where you know you are not alone. Where you know someone else is living it. And gets it.

Hundreds of thousands of women have already come together here.
But now I want to give you more.
Because motherhood shouldn't just be about survival. 
We shouldn't just be striving to make it through the day.
I want to build a place where moms have resources... and plenty of them.
Moms need resources. All moms. Young moms, old moms, expectant moms, moms of 1, moms of 10, moms of young kids, and moms of older ones. 
Moms need a relatable place to go where they can get reassurance that they are doing enough. But they also need resources to be able to do better.
Because sometimes you just want to know your kids are not the only ones pulling their own poop out of their pants, other times you could really use some advice from another mom, and other times what you really need is an expert.
Moms need a place where they can laugh, cry, get help, share ideas, and where they can find ways to give their families what they need while also keeping themselves on the priority list.
Because when they can do all that, then they will really have all the tools necessary to be the moms they envisioned themselves being before all the not-so-pretty, unexpected, and unpredictable realities of motherhood set in!
Your small investment will make this a reality.
By investing in this campaign, we will build a seriously kick ass platform. We will give you and every other mom a one-stop site that not only entertains and reassures, but that teaches  and guides, and educates and connects. An authentic place that gives us an abundance of tools to improve the quality of our families' lives and our own.
Your investment into Not Your Average Mom is an investment into your sanity, yourself and your family. Your investment into this campaign will give you access to the things you need. Its whole entire mission is to help you and every other mother like you to truly enjoy motherhood instead of merely survive it.
Where does your contribution go?

Your contribution directly facilitates the development of the new NYAM platform, which will allow for the access of all of the brand new NYAM resources to anyone and everyone. It enables the gathering of resources, educational tools, professional & expert advice, and it empowers us to launch from a place of usefulness and value.
The current Not Your Average Mom site simply cannot support the vision for the platform. So, it's time to grow.And growth requires investment. It requires saying goodbye to the old and making space for the new.

So what will your investment give you?

Remember your first time reading one of my posts? 

Remember what made you love NYAM— the honesty, the laughs, the comfort of knowing you aren't alone in any of your experiences?
All of that same stuff that made you fall in love with Not Your Average Mom will still always be there. It's what makes the site what it is, and the last thing I would ever want to do is change that.
This new platform is going to take everything that NYAM already is, and take it to the next level. 

Easier navigation, community forums, expert financial advice, meal planning advice, fitness courses, webinars, parenting advice, not losing your mind advice, book clubs, a store full of useful products that will make life better and easier. 
Honestly, once the new platform is built, the sky is the limit. I'll be able to provide you with just about anything you need to make this journey through motherhood easier.
How can you help?
The most impactful way you can help is to invest! There are lots of great perks available to you for your investment! Check them out!
And if you're not in a position to invest, I'm certain that you know someone who could use this platform. In fact, I'm sure you know many people who could. 
So if you can't invest, I'd strongly encourage you to spread the word! The more people we get behind this, the more expansive and helpful the platform will be for you and other parents everywhere!
And when you share about it, be sure to use the hashtag #NotYourAverageMom! I'll be watching for it!


You can also help by staying up to date and sharing my blog posts online and with friends and family that you think would enjoy them. 

Let other moms out there know what you love about Not Your Average Mom.

Together we will build a seriously kick ass site for moms. And dads. And everyone else. And I'm so excited that you want to be a part of it.

 unimaginable destruction caused by flooding due to a heavy rain,

completely flooded, people are left without water and electricity, 
lacking even basic things like food, blankets, clothes, shoes,

getting even worst, since it is really cold and these people are 
freezing. Although Bosnians are really sympathetic, there are ongoing 
campaigns for help and a number of donations have been made so far, it's
 going to be hard, since people are facing even more problems when the
