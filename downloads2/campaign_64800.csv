The internal gears are tightly attached and durable. Top quality is guaranteed and the product comes with a full one-year warranty.
 This screwdriver uses an all-metal gearbox that's both compact and powerful. The torsion is up to 0.9N.M for electric and 3N.M for manual use.Note that the electric torque cannot always be applied: for example, a high level of torque is required in the initial state and in the final tightening of a screw. In this case, do not release the switch, but continue to hold down the switch while swinging the screwdriver to left and right. The host will then immediately start the self-locking function, and increase the electric torque.
 The handle is only 31mm in diameter, which means the screwdriver is suitable for most people to hold comfortably. It can be used for a wide variety of household tasks, such as disassembly and assembly of small furniture, tables and chairs, door handles, various types of lamp, switches, etc.
 The screwdriver has an Automatic-Manual design, which means it can easily be switched between electric and manual usages. If you enjoy the fun of taking things apart, then it can be a traditional manual screwdriver. If you're after speed, the automatic function can help you to install or remove screws in seconds.
 Ordinary gun-type screwdrivers tend to require a manual direction change, but this unique screwdriver has only a single button on its entire body. You can start it with one click and control the direction of rotation without switching buttons. And it's battery-powered, so that screws can be easily turned with just a light touch – no major effort required!
 Three shadow-less LED lights are also installed where the cutter head is connected. The lights can be automatically activated when you turn on the screwdriver, providing maximum illumination of your workspace and allowing you to operate in dimly-lit environments.
 The screwdriver uses magnetic suction mounting between the bits and the body, so that no additional tools are required for installation. Just place the replacement tool head close to the body of the screwdriver to complete the installation. Continuing suction ensures that bits don't loosen during use, making the screwdriver very safe and convenient.
 This is a fully complete and practical screwdriver set for home use: assembling beds and cabinets, repairing electrical appliances, etc. It has varying sizes of screwdriver bits that will easily meet your every need, with bit hardness of up to 60hrc. It is also equipped with 36 different screwdriver heads to handle varying types and sizes of screws. 
   The 67mm operating shaft allows you to rotate the screw easily, even if it's in a deep groove. In this way, this handy electric screwdriver can be seen as a robotic assistant that professionally disassembles anything screwed, allowing you to complete a job without any effort.
 The screwdriver is powered by a lithium battery and can be recharged via Type-C. Charging takes only 2 hours. The unit displays a red light during charging status and a green light when fully charged. With its large capacity 1300mAh battery, the screwdriver is both cordless and portable. It has great endurance, lasting for more than 180 days of standby on a single charge, and it can be used for 10 to 30 days (non-continuous usage).
 Ever been unable to manipulate a screwdriver due to sweaty hands? The electric screwdriver's accessories also include a soft anti-slip mat that ups friction, greatly increasing your productivity.Thanks for the comments from backers all over the world. We are very glad that our previous Wowstick has made your lives more convenient and helped with such a variety of tasks!

<h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
<div>
<p><i><b>Can I put it in the dishwasher</b>?</i></p>
<p>The tumbler body is not dishwasher safe. The reason is the high temperatures in a dishwasher, particularly during the heated dry part of the cycle when the mug is near the heating element at the bottom of the dishwasher. The high temperatures reached in a dishwasher might degrade the vacuum insulation with time.</p>
<p>The cover and sleeve are dishwasher-safe though, and are designed to be easily disassembled for cleaning by hand or in the dishwasher.</p>
<p><b><i>Does the lid provide a leak-tight seal?</i></b></p>
<p>The lid on these mugs is not designed to be leak tight; it is intended to keep your drink hot and to keep it from sloshing out when you are walking with the mug, or when the mug is in your car (offroading, or on the typical Chicago city street, for instance). If the mug is inverted with coffee in it, it will leak, though slowly.</p>
<p><b><i>What do the temperature-time measurements look like?</i></b></p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>With explosive, year-over-year increases in online sales leading to more and more deliveries everyday, package theft has become one of the fastest growing crimes in the world.  ""Porch Pirates"" are exploiting this situation and with carriers delivering over 7 billion packages a year, they are finding plenty of opportunities.  Today, everything from food to personal items to prescription drugs are delivered to homes and offices daily.  Theft of these parcels leads to increased costs, massive inconvenience and potentially dangerous situations.  With this in mind, we challenged ourselves to create a modern solution to solve these problems and in the process contribute positively to individual happiness, general productivity and the global economy as a whole, all at once.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519253982/jk4tm8p8zuy4l6sfmkgt.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Lock-Pod team is dedicated to providing a smart, elegant, easy-to-use solution to help online and local shoppers safeguard deliveries of their purchased goods.  It was important to us that it was portable, removable and could be adapted to work in just about any environment or situation.  Our goal is to bring this product to all households, businesses and organizations at an affordable price to help deter theft, reduce crime, create safer delivery situations and ease the minds of consumers (and drivers) everywhere.</p>
<ul>
<li>A secure and reliable solution to prevent criminals from stealing your deliveries</li>
<li>A smart and intuitive system that works with existing technology and all major platforms</li>
<li>A solution that is easy to use and easily controlled from your computer or mobile device</li>
<li>An ""outside the home"" solution for receiving deliveries without having to allow strangers to enter your home when you're not available</li>
<li>A personal mailbox and storage system for friends and family dropping off or picking up items for you.  Great for renters or Airbnb, no more leaving your keys under the door mat...</li>

</div></div>","Lock-Pod at a Glance:


Full Control All in One App:
 

 
Take complete control of your Lock-Pod via our proprietary, patent-pending mobile app on your Wi-Fi connected smartphone, tablet or computer.  Here are some of the functions that the app allows you to do:

Engage or disengage either lock separately, or both locks together, from virtually anywhere.
View your active Lock-Pod integrated camera or view your other network-synced cameras.
Adjust the temperature inside Lock-Pod's Thermoelectric condition-controlled compartment.
Allow access to one or both compartments, specifically designed for Rx, CE and standard package deliveries.  Lock-Pod accommodates all standard size FedEx, UPS and USPS boxes.
Receive email or app notifications for status including: Unlocked, Locked, Opened, Closed, Delivery Completed and more via Preferences.  The integrated Motion Activated Camera automatically turns on the camera and records whenever movement is detected.
Schedule when the compartments are unlocked during the day for friends or family to drop off items, or give them a digital code to manually lock/unlock whenever they arrive.
Sync with all major carriers for pre-delivery notices, tracking number cross-referencing, complete process scanning and automated delivery completed notifications.  Set preferences for ""e-signatures"" to never get a re-delivery notice again!



Lock-Pod Compatibility:
 
Our patent-pending app is specifically designed to utilize the most current API technology.  This allows us to ensure integration and compatibility with all major platforms from both carriers and manufacturers of home automation products. Implementing API technology that is flexible and adaptable gives our Lock-Pod users full, reliable integration with a universe of smart devices.
 



Why Lock-Pod?
 
With explosive, year-over-year increases in online sales leading to more and more deliveries everyday, package theft has become one of the fastest growing crimes in the world.  ""Porch Pirates"" are exploiting this situation and with carriers delivering over 7 billion packages a year, they are finding plenty of opportunities.  Today, everything from food to personal items to prescription drugs are delivered to homes and offices daily.  Theft of these parcels leads to increased costs, massive inconvenience and potentially dangerous situations.  With this in mind, we challenged ourselves to create a modern solution to solve these problems and in the process contribute positively to individual happiness, general productivity and the global economy as a whole, all at once.

The Lock-Pod team is dedicated to providing a smart, elegant, easy-to-use solution to help online and local shoppers safeguard deliveries of their purchased goods.  It was important to us that it was portable, removable and could be adapted to work in just about any environment or situation.  Our goal is to bring this product to all households, businesses and organizations at an affordable price to help deter theft, reduce crime, create safer delivery situations and ease the minds of consumers (and drivers) everywhere.

A secure and reliable solution to prevent criminals from stealing your deliveries
A smart and intuitive system that works with existing technology and all major platforms
A solution that is easy to use and easily controlled from your computer or mobile device
An ""outside the home"" solution for receiving deliveries without having to allow strangers to enter your home when you're not available
A personal mailbox and storage system for friends and family dropping off or picking up items for you.  Great for renters or Airbnb, no more leaving your keys under the door mat...



What the experts have to say:
 
“People who are relying on a camera to protect their packages are probably kidding themselves”

“You never know who’s going to recognize the person. 
Then, if we get that person’s ID, we put out a warrant for their address.”

“Thieves are going from house to house to house.  They just follow a UPS truck,

<p>Tupuca means to indulge, a word derived from a local Angolan

think of how to efficiently bring this vision to the masses, while using

<p>Through our interactive application, we create a

will look to solve daily inconvenient situations where staff has high food
demands with very little time between breaks and traffic constricts movement,
Tupuca will deliver nutritious meals to people in the workplace that might
otherwise pass up lunch due to constraints and ultimately be less productive.</p>
<p>Job opportunities for young biker boys will be created
through the demand for an adequate logistic network, getting them off the
streets performing informal taxi work into being paid staff and professionals.</p>
<p>Addressing the bigger issue has never been easier, Tupuca’s

<p></p>
<p>With any innovation comes great risk especially in a
developing country. Tupuca is taking into account the internal risk such as low
technology adoption by the employees, miss-communication, and miss handling of
funds. Our goal is to mitigate these risks by training our employees using the
best practices from well-established industries.<b>Convenience,
innovation, efficiency, transparency, and honesty </b>is embedded to our core believe and
mission.</p>
<p>Externally,
the major risks that we have to take into account are malfunction and high data usage of the
application and website, failure of method of payment, low market acceptance,
non-compliance by the restaurants, copyrights violations, and lawsuits. Malfunction
and high data usage risks will be tackled from the design and creation stage
during the prototype-testing phase. By providing different payment options such
as cash, credit cards, mobile banking, and rechargeable membership cards will
be able to serve a greater target market. Restaurants compliance will be
improved by providing them a ready to use software in a tablet where they see
and respond to the orders and reservation with minimum effort. Lawsuits and
copyright infringement will be mitigated by hiring a lawyer which will help to
create detailed copyrights, terms and agreements conditions that will protect
our business.</p>

would see us get across the line and successfully launch our app.
We have come up with exciting perks for our potential
investors: these perks aim to make the donor/investor feel part of our journey.
Tupuca will guarantee that your donation will find its way to the intended
hands that need it the most. 

The Impact 


Through our interactive application, we create a
comprehensive platform that aims to connect the users with multiple
restaurants, ensuring them timely delivery of quality foods or pick up. Tupuca
will look to solve daily inconvenient situations where staff has high food
demands with very little time between breaks and traffic constricts movement,
Tupuca will deliver nutritious meals to people in the workplace that might
otherwise pass up lunch due to constraints and ultimately be less productive.
Job opportunities for young biker boys will be created
through the demand for an adequate logistic network, getting them off the
streets performing informal taxi work into being paid staff and professionals.
Addressing the bigger issue has never been easier, Tupuca’s
built function for optional donation, we can make sure that you and I start
taking steps towards solving pressing matters when it comes to child
starvation.    Risks & Challenges  



With any innovation comes great risk especially in a
developing country. Tupuca is taking into account the internal risk such as low
technology adoption by the employees, miss-communication, and miss handling of
funds. Our goal is to mitigate these risks by training our employees using the
best practices from well-established industries.Convenience,
innovation, efficiency, transparency, and honesty is embedded to our core believe and
mission.
Externally,
the major risks that we have to take into account are malfunction and high data usage of the
application and website, failure of method of payment, low market acceptance,
non-compliance by the restaurants, copyrights violations, and lawsuits. Malfunction
and high data usage risks will be tackled from the design and creation stage
during the prototype-testing phase. By providing different payment options such
as cash, credit cards, mobile banking, and rechargeable membership cards will
be able to serve a greater target market. Restaurants compliance will be
improved by providing them a ready to use software in a tablet where they see
and respond to the orders and reservation with minimum effort. Lawsuits and
copyright infringement will be mitigated by hiring a lawyer which will help to
create detailed copyrights, terms and agreements conditions that will protect
our business.

  

Other Ways You Can Help 

We appreciate your support towards making our dream come
true and to brighten the day of so many other people that make part of the
Tupuca circle. 
Please spread the word and have it at the back of your mind
that through your effort, someone will have a chance to donate to the less fortunate
when they use TUPUCA. You are a big difference maker.

Fighting energy poverty





In collaboration with the organisation AI4D (Africa Investment For development), our aim is to bring light into these people’s lives thanks to a simple and eco-friendly solution which promotes
local economic development.

How do we make a difference ? 

We have created lighting systems
which illuminate streets, households, shops, schools, medical centers at all
time of day and night. This solution is:

Fighting energy poverty the simplest way, with a plastic bottle

Our lighting systems are made of a simple circuit, a battery, an LED, a plastic bottle and a small solar panel.The simplicity of this solution allows anybody to build it from scratch. 

An eco-friendly solution
Besides reducing and reusing plastic waste, our lighting systems use renewable energy for better environmental value and social impact.

A south-south innovation, created by the poorest for the poorest

We share our open-source technology with local communities. Once they own the know-how they can take care of all the maintenance and install new lighting systems. Hence, they become totally independent from us and can create their own micro enterprises.






Our impacts











Where the money goes ?

With 27.000$, we can ensure the project in Ivory Coast!


The money will be used to:


buy the required materials to build the lighting systems;

finance human and material logistic;


install the lighting systems both in people's homes and in the streets (2.000 villagers involved);


train the local community in order to guarantee the economic sustainability of their actions;

measure the impact of our installation and our trainings with the help and support of our local partners.

With 50.000$, we can ensure the replicability of our actions!
The money will be used to:



support the micro entrepreneur with the organisation of the maintenance as well as the new installation of the new lighting systems;


support the microentrepreneur in reinforcing connections with local suppliers;


organize new projets in the region with the support of Mr. Ehouman Oi Ehouman, Tiémélékro's mayor.

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Peter is a Hungarian
designer with over 17 years of experience in sports management. The story began with the production of a folding bike. He wanted to keep his office wear clean, so
decided to build a chainless commuter bicycle equipped with carbon belt drive
system. The idea to upcycle the spare parts not used for the bike was the first
step...</span><br/></p>

<p></p>
<p>The bike desk lamp was
originally created by Peter as a solution when his daughter started school in 2013 and did not like sitting at the desk.
Some friends asked him to create a lamp for their kids so he started to make
them in different colours. In 2015 Peter founded Industrial Kid to improve the original design and launch the bike desk lamp
internationally.<br/></p>

OUR STORY 
Peter is a Hungarian
designer with over 17 years of experience in sports management. The story began with the production of a folding bike. He wanted to keep his office wear clean, so
decided to build a chainless commuter bicycle equipped with carbon belt drive
system. The idea to upcycle the spare parts not used for the bike was the first
step...


The bike desk lamp was
originally created by Peter as a solution when his daughter started school in 2013 and did not like sitting at the desk.
Some friends asked him to create a lamp for their kids so he started to make
them in different colours. In 2015 Peter founded Industrial Kid to improve the original design and launch the bike desk lamp
internationally.

FEATURES AND BENEFITS
 
Industrial Kid’s bicycle-inspired, contemporary design lamps offer the customers the freedom of choice by participating in the creative process. Each piece is unique because individual owners customize the lamp by playing with the colour of the spare parts.

The
economic LED bulb can be switched on and off with a gentle pull
of the brake levers. The LED bulb included. To enjoy Industrial Kid experience just follow these 3 steps:

SPARE PARTS AND MATERIALS
BRAKE LEVERS AND STEM

Brake levers and stem available in 10 different colours to make the desk lamp compliment any interior. The brake levers are made of aluminum, the stem is made of steel. We have a variety of different colour concepts and will continue to develop imaginative and innovative designs and finishes, offering you complete freedom of expression.
BOWDEN CABLE HOUSING AND GIPS



The grips made of soft rubber. Bowden cable housing and grips also available in 10 different colours.

WOODEN PARTS

The base and the arm of the lamps are made of birch. Due to the hardness of the material, we shape it with power tools. As its colour range is fairly wide with a light grain that may be straight, wavy, or curly, the number of variations are unlimited. The wooden parts treated and finished with natural preservatives (linseed oil) only.




BETA TESTING

Bike desk lamp underwent a long design process. A lot has changed since the first lamp was produced.

The current version of the lamp is the result of multiple iterations. Challenges were multifold: finding the right shape for the base and arm, ensuring good balance without creating a heavy product. We pay attention to the selected materials to provide a child-friendly product and user experience. In order to present you unique and exquisite artwork throughout the production we have very rigorous quality control. We insist that every single detail of our product is perfect.




We also pay special attention to the tecnical standards and regulations. The base product (regular desk lamp switching method) bears the EC declaration of conformity. The production is in compliance with the relevant safety requirements of certain electrical equipment.

Since William Pemberton founded us, our name has been synonymous with exquisitely wrought, fine architectural hardware and bespoke fixtures, fittings and furnishings. Today, our bronze, brass and silverwork can still be seen in the world's finest interiors, showcasing our mastery of the ancient process of Lost Wax Casting.Why should you care?Because we are passionate about keeping rare artisan tradition alive.Lost Wax Casting is a meticulous and highly skilled technique. First a model is crafted from wax, which is then enveloped in a heatproof substance. The wax is then melted away, leaving a perfectly shaped mould into which to pour the molten metal. This process takes time and care, but the results are startlingly intricate.With your help our artisans will be able to practice under one roof, acting as the custodians of a tradition that dates back thousands of years of experience.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We’re BobaBoxes, the bubble tea loving company. Just to give you a quick run-down on who we are and what we do. We’re a brand new subscription box company put together by two bubble tea lovers myself and Dan. We’re currently working on building up a buzz around our name in advance of our official launch in October.</p>
<p>Me and Dan have spent the last couple of months ordering flavouring, tapioca and bursting balls from all around the world to make sure we got the closest we could to making a commercial quality tea from home. We plan on offering these ingredients in two different size BobaBoxes, the first is our standard 4 flavour 8 cup box. The second a 2 flavour 4 cup box. Box boxes will of course come with jelly, straws, bursting bubbles, our own recipes and recommendations and anything else you’ll need for that month (bring your own milk and water).</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're currently working our socks off to get the first box out to you guys. So far we've been taking preorders for the box and we're getting a slow and steady turn around but we think it's high time you got some boba! The money raised here will mainly go towards the cost of our box packaging and a couple of things for us to add inside.</p>

Brilliant!!</div>Hiddenbed was born of necessity. The patented mechanism was first developed because the inventors son moved in with him after finishing school and there was simply not enough room in the small house they lived in. A small section of the main living area was sectioned off and the 5'x 8' area needed to house a bed and some room for his son to work. After much trial and error the Hiddenbed was born.  </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>Although we currently provide mechanisms to manufacturers of finished furniture, it has been a long road to bring the Hiddenbed to the masses both in quality and price. The problem is that retailers make the price of this excellent piece of furniture out of reach for most people. </div>
<div>We decided to make the drawings and mechanisms available to the masses and need to re-tool our manufacturing facility in order to make this happen. We need to increase our manufacturing capabilities in order to make the complete furniture available at direct to consumer prices.  We've designed Hiddenbeds that are reasonably simple for the DIY'er to make themselves with easily obtained raw materials.</div>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact of Hiddenbeds</h3> Whether it's in a small or ""Tiny"" house, or a spare bedroom or a student housing, everyone has found themselves in need of more space. Many of us are downsizing our homes and even moving into Tiny Homes or have to share with friends or family. The Hiddenbed provides a very innovative solution for any space problem you have.  </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Starting a manufacturing facility for making RTA furniture is very expensive and has many risks because of the large competitors that are manufacturing inferior quality furniture at very high prices.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>This product can help grow the world!</strong></p>
<p>Vertical and non-horizontal gardening techniques have demonstrated benefits and are considered highly desirable, especially in urban environments which tend to have limited access and or high value physical space. Despite the challenges with urban cultivation, there is a growing awareness of most major metropolitan and urban areas as being proverbial “food deserts,” whereby agricultural inputs are required to be transported into the urban area, from outside resources. Users can also use this product as an option for a decorative resource for infertile environments, in order to improve visual aesthetics. Most users and target audiences have found that the Annual Explosion Quad Panel is comparably cost effective to similar products and resources.</p>
<p>Nestled in North Central FL, Natalia Pegg and Russ Anderson met first as educators within a school for challenged youth. Working day in and day out together, they bonded over plants, business, and innovation. With Natalia's background in business and education and Russ' experience as a Master Gardener and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/UHeirlooms/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Edible Landscaper</a>, ideas started turning into reality. Two years of testing and 4 designs later, they've put together a pretty cool product!</p>
<p>Russ had been seeking affordable vertical growing options for his client base and wasn't impressed with the options available. Natalia shared her vision for what was affectionately dubbed a ""tree skirt."" and with some collaborative analysis of textiles and systems available, they slowly figured out an affordable vertical gardening system that is easy to set up for almost any space, level or experience, or range of mobility. </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Please, Help Us Reach Our Goal!</h3>
<p>We are seeking $30,000 for additional startup costs and to sustain our contracts with our U.S. based manufacturers. Some of these costs include both online and traditional marketing strategies, additional legal fees, new product development and design, as well as, supporting the current manufacturing of our first shipment due Mid to Late May.  We've teamed up with a great (U.S.) based textile manufacturer and have built a solid relationship with many  industry resources over the past two and a half years. We have spent a significant amount of time and money on this project and look forward to the next phase of building this company with your support. </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>A Bit About Our Perks!</strong></h3>
<p>We are fully invested in our company and products and are prepared to  meet our goals during this campaign. Our financial outlook has been structured to continue manufacturing for all our current and future customers through direct pre-sales resulting from continued marketing efforts. We have strategic relationships being built which poise our company for growth through various financial avenues, including private investors, retail investors, and direct sales through Independent Contractor networks. </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3>
<p>Affordability: This product makes it affordable for every household or commercial property to take part in vertical gardening. There are other options on the market that have been around that just are not affordable for everyone. This poses a barrier that the Annual Explosion Outdoor Vertical Garden System breaks down by keeping a fair price for its Quad Panel System. </p>
<p>Versatility:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mobility: Set up is incredible easy and transfer between locations is even easier. </li>
<li>Great for a range of ages, experience, and styles.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>A major challenge we have faced is our dedication to remaining a 'Made in America' company. In our attempt to create and deliver high quality and durable products while maintaining affordability for the consumer, we have chosen to overcome this challenge by offering value added service and social media content to our line of products to offset any perceived lack of value.  A strong rapport with our major consumer bases should prove to be effective in building a brand that commands a respectable price for its product. We feel it is important to support our domestic economy, but we need our potential customers to support our cause and our commitment. </p>
<p>Another challenge is building a social media following quickly enough to gain momentum during our Indiegogo campaign to ensure success.</p>
<ul><li>Our networks and communities are really important to us and social media provides a great avenue to showcase our innovation. A strong support base and commitment to sustainable and strategic marketing will hopefully help us to overcome these hurdles.</li></ul>

In our attempt to create and deliver high quality and durable products while maintaining affordability for the consumer, we have chosen to overcome this challenge by offering value added service and social media content to our line of products to offset any perceived lack of value.  A strong rapport with our major consumer bases should prove to be effective in building a brand that commands a respectable price for its product. We feel it is important to support our domestic economy, but we need our potential customers to support our cause and our commitment. 
Another challenge is building a social media following quickly enough to gain momentum during our Indiegogo campaign to ensure success.
Our networks and communities are really important to us and social media provides a great avenue to showcase our innovation. A strong support base and commitment to sustainable and strategic marketing will hopefully help us to overcome these hurdles.

It features 8 smart access methods for convenience and versatility. Combined with the optional Wi-Fi bridge, you can remotely manage permissions and users or check the access logs in-app from anywhere. Approved by multiple international standards and regulations, S1 provides industry-leading safety performance with a tamperproof all-in-one structure and bank-level encryption built-in, to protect your home and properties 24/7.    Powered by the most cutting-edge techs, S1 has a fast (less than 0.5s) and accurate fingerprint reader with the ability to store up to 50 different fingerprints. In addition, there are multiple password modes to suit any situation.

Permanent Password – Works as an admin password or for immediate family members.

Dynamic Password – Is valid for 5 minutes and useful for visitors to a store or property.

Virtual Password – Combine any digit with the right password for added security, to prevent any possible peep.

Temporary Password – Highly versatile method to set entry time periods by minutes, hours, and dates. Such as: valid from 10:05 am - 11:30 for a specific date or each Monday in a set period. It is an excellent method for employees, service people, or Airbnb guests.
  As an internet-enabled smart lock, the S1 makes remote access easier than ever with the smart Wi-Fi bridge. Entry can be controlled from anywhere in two ways. Remotely unlock the door with your phone for family or visitors, and ensuring that you will never be locked out. Additionally, the app has robust permission management that can instantly grant or revoke permissions remotely so that other users can unlock the door with their own phone.For each access, you will receive the notification on your phone and the app will record the log, making it a convenient yet safe access method for services people or rental guests!  S1 Smart Lock uses convenient yet secure physical entry methods as well. It is NFC compatible with smart devices including phones and smartwatches that can act as an electronic key for entry. The S1 package also includes 3 NFC badges for durable, portable, and reliable entry. People with unshaped or blurred fingerprints can use the NFC badge to easily unlock for faster entry. S1 Smart Lock is fully compatible with Google and Amazon Alexa voice assistants that can open the door using voice commands and it neatly integrates into a smart home system for the ultimate in modern convenience and security.However, in some instances, a mechanical key may be helpful as a redundant backup system. The S1 uses a hidden key cylinder design that accepts a mechanical key as access.  Simply remove the shell and insert your key to get access instantly.   The included YEEUU app is a powerful way to fully manage access for any door. It maintains a complete log of entries that can be reviewed anytime, anywhere. If any change in protocol is needed the app permission manager provides total control of each visitor’s entry permissions. Change passwords, set limits, adjust time periods and grant or revoke permissions instantly using the in-app features.   For any door, security is the primary goal. The S1 Smart Lock is designed for rock-solid security and durability. It is constructed with a B-class cylinder and aluminum alloy shell that is tamper-proof. Its all-in-one cylinder design has a separated motor structure that makes it electromagnetic hack-proof and impossible to manipulate. It meets the approval rating of all essential international safety standards including FCC, CE, & ROHS.Data stays safe with AES 128-bit bank-level encryption. AES, is a symmetric encryption algorithm and one of the most secure used by financial institutions and governments. For further data security, all the data is stored locally using methods approved by European GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) and CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) regulation. Automatically Locks Unlike a typical doorknob, S1 always stays locked until the access is authenticated, which will unlock the door for 5 seconds before lock again. There is no worry of leaving a home or property unlocked by accident when leaving the location. When you leave the home, the S1 automatically locks without the need to turn the knob, to prevent any unwanted visitors slipping into your home.By placing the authenticated fingerprinter on the identifier for 8 seconds, the lock will be switched between always-lock and always-unlock to meet your requirements in different situations. Auto-deactivation & Alarm System For added security, S1 Smart Lock has systems to prevent manipulation or password hacks. The system Auto-deactivates after too many failed entry attempts. After 15 unsuccessful fingerprint attempts or 6 unsuccessful password attempts, the system will deactivate for 15 minutes and send an instant in-app alert to the administrator. Enable or Disable the Ability of Locking from the Inside One of a kind, S1 brings the most customizable experience for the door entry control. By simply install or remove the rotary knob, you can enable or disable the capability of locking from the inside, to meet different requirements of your different rooms.  The S1 Smart Lock is designed for low-maintenance convenience and simple battery changes. It uses 3 triple-A alkaline batteries for 12 months of working time, much longer than the common products on the market. Battery percentage remaining is shown in-app along with a low battery indicator in the device & in-app reminder. Even in the case of battery outage, you can still use the mechanical key for entry. S1 is durable and made for exposure to the elements. The metal surface has an anti-corrosion treatment with mat finish for durability and delivers the most deluxe feeling for door entry. The device is IP55 rated for water and dust resistance that withstand various environments.   The S1 Smart Lock is designed to fit any door. S1 can be directly used in the standard single-cylinder deadbolt lock and split-cylinder deadbolt lock. Combined with our optional front panel and 5572 lock body(see below), S1 can be also used in the integrated-cylinder lock.Note: Add-on option is available after you choose your perk.   Step 1. Check the picture below to see if your lock type is included.Note: For type 1-4 (the cyan part), S1 smart lock can be used directly without any optional add-on.For type 5-6 (the gray part), the optional add-on is needed. A 5572 lock body is needed for type 5. A 5572 lock body and a front panel are needed for type 6.If you are not sure about the compatibility or your lock type, you can also contact us at yeeuu.ujia@gmail.com for help. Step 2. Measure and check if the clearance meet the requirements below(For single bolt lock, only the center-to-edge clearance (>50mm) is required.):If your lock meets all the requirements above, you can use S1 on your door. For perk choosing, please check the picture in step 1.      Note: The only difference between Basic and Deluxe is the Fingerprint access function.

<p>We are excited to participate and present <a href=""http://partyspotgreetings.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>PartyBoxGreetings</b></a> at <a href=""http://innovatesocal.com/event-info.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>InnovateSoCal 2015</b></a> as an exhibitor. InnovateSoCal 2015 is a platform to showcase and connect today's most inspiring <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>&amp;</b> <b>
innovators</b> in the USA. Innovators who are 
dedicating themselves and their ventures to transform their industry, 
community and/or business practice. In fact, <b>we'd love you to come and visit us at our booth, March 26, 2015.</b></p>
<p>The innovate!SoCal 2014 Conference was the first symposium that brought 
together <b>disruptive thinkers</b> in economic development to work together to
 find solutions to building the entrepreneur ecosystem in Southern 
California and beyond. The day features panels and renowned speakers sharing their 
perspectives on tools and models that help establish a powerful, 
self-sustaining, nurturing environment for high growth start-ups.</p>
<p>This <i>prestigious</i> event is sponsored by The <a href=""http://www.kauffman.org/what-we-do/entrepreneurship"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation</b></a>. The <b>EMKF</b>
 is dedicated to entrepreneurship and innovation. In fact, Kauffman's 
entrepreneurship work is national in scale and global in reach. Their 
entrepreneurship strategy
 supports entrepreneurs in the U.S. by expanding signature education 
programs, notably Founders School, FastTrac, and 1 Million Cups, and 
investing in proven education models. <b>They also seek to foster start-up 
communities</b> and develop challenges to <b>spur entrepreneurial activity</b> in 
select metropolitan areas.</p>
<p><i>""By casting a wider net to ensure  the broadest possible participation 
in innovative entrepreneurship, as well as  better understanding how 
entrepreneurs learn and grow their startups, SoCal is  going to be a 
model for entrepreneurial ecosystems everywhere, and a breeding  ground 
for many of our country's next great ventures.""</i> – <b>Thom Ruhe, Vice  President of Entrepreneurship, The Kauffman Foundation</b></p>
<p>With that said, our <b>INDIEGOGO</b> <b>EVENT</b> is aimed at a modest monetary target leading to the larger goal of <b>PROOF OF CONCEPT (POC).</b> POC may lead to, and is intended for a substantially higher <i>investment offering</i>.</p>
<h1>Challenges...<br/>Create Strength In Character &amp; Reward</h1>
<p>Some
 of the risks and challenges are obvious, some not. ""To me, failure is 
not an option; in this case, I have immense staying power. Some call it 
strength, some say intestinal fortitude; in either case, it's a lot like
 this scene from <b>ROCKY BALBOA</b>."" <b>Vincent Medina</b>, <i>Managing Director, PartyBoxGreetings. Google Search Domination &amp; Visibility Expert</i></p>

PartyBoxGreetingsProudly Exhibiting @ Innovate!SoCal 2015
We are excited to participate and present PartyBoxGreetings at InnovateSoCal 2015 as an exhibitor. InnovateSoCal 2015 is a platform to showcase and connect today's most inspiring entrepreneurs & 
innovators in the USA. Innovators who are 
dedicating themselves and their ventures to transform their industry, 
community and/or business practice. In fact, we'd love you to come and visit us at our booth, March 26, 2015.
The innovate!SoCal 2014 Conference was the first symposium that brought 
together disruptive thinkers in economic development to work together to
 find solutions to building the entrepreneur ecosystem in Southern 
California and beyond. The day features panels and renowned speakers sharing their 
perspectives on tools and models that help establish a powerful, 
self-sustaining, nurturing environment for high growth start-ups.
This prestigious event is sponsored by The Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation. The EMKF
 is dedicated to entrepreneurship and innovation. In fact, Kauffman's 
entrepreneurship work is national in scale and global in reach. Their 
entrepreneurship strategy
 supports entrepreneurs in the U.S. by expanding signature education 
programs, notably Founders School, FastTrac, and 1 Million Cups, and 
investing in proven education models. They also seek to foster start-up 
communities and develop challenges to spur entrepreneurial activity in 
select metropolitan areas.
""By casting a wider net to ensure  the broadest possible participation 
in innovative entrepreneurship, as well as  better understanding how 
entrepreneurs learn and grow their startups, SoCal is  going to be a 
model for entrepreneurial ecosystems everywhere, and a breeding  ground 
for many of our country's next great ventures."" – Thom Ruhe, Vice  President of Entrepreneurship, The Kauffman Foundation
With that said, our INDIEGOGO EVENT is aimed at a modest monetary target leading to the larger goal of PROOF OF CONCEPT (POC). POC may lead to, and is intended for a substantially higher investment offering.
Challenges...Create Strength In Character & Reward
Some
 of the risks and challenges are obvious, some not. ""To me, failure is 
not an option; in this case, I have immense staying power. Some call it 
strength, some say intestinal fortitude; in either case, it's a lot like
 this scene from ROCKY BALBOA."" Vincent Medina, Managing Director, PartyBoxGreetings. Google Search Domination & Visibility Expert

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>- How does it work?</b></p>
<p>A capacitive sensor is used for the circuit design, it will be activated by the capacitance from the human hands and generated an electronic signal to turn the light on.</p>
<p><b>- How long time the battery will last for continuous lighting?</b></p>
<p>With the fully charged 2000mAh battery, it will light up for 15 hours, each time the light will keep lighting for 14 seconds, that is to say, the light will light up 3800 times (14 seconds each time) with a fully charged battery.</p>
<p><b>-Can I shut off the light when I am using Phoebe as power bank?</b></p>
<p>Yes, by keep pressing the power button for 3 seconds, the auto-sensing function can be shut off, and another 3 seconds pressing to turn it on.</p>
<p><b>- Does it detect human hands only?</b></p>
<p>The main purpose of using a capacitive sensor for the circuit design is to detect the human hands.  There are several other capacitive objects, which will be detected to make the lights up, however, the light is designed to be automatically turn off after 14 seconds to make sure it won't draw the power all the way out. Also, the auto sensing function can be manually shut off by pressing the power button.</p>

<h3>Meet Mos Eco</h3>
<p>Hi, we're Lauren &amp; Emilie, an Irish 31year old and a Dutch 29year old on a mission to create less trash. We are launching a range of eco-swaps to make it easy to live a lower waste lifestyle, swapping out every day plastic items for sustainable and compostable alternatives that are not only less trashy, they are high quality, durable and good looking too. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Everyone works hard for their money. That's why we're not just asking you to invest but we propose a win-win solution: If you help us fund our first production round, we give you a discount on the products. It's essentially a pre-order discount in exchange for a slightly longer shipping time. </p>
<p>This is what we'll need and what will happen with the funds;</p>
<ul>
<li>We're looking to get €4500 for our first production round, which will cover the production of the products, the shipping &amp; the import costs. We've already covered the design, pre-production and sampling part ourselves. </li>
<li>If this funding round is successful, we'll be able to produce our first round of razors, dish brushes, replacement heads, pot brushes and silicone lids. </li>
<li>If we don't get to the full amount, we will take out a loan instead, to cover the additional costs. So either way you will receive your products if you've placed a pre-order during this funding round. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As we've said in our video, two billion razors are estimated to be thrown away each year in the US alone. That's a huge amount of plastic that isn't recycled and ends up in landfills. Add the amount of cling film, sponges and dish brushes that we throw away each year to the equation and you'll realise it's time for some swaps. Because they're everyday items, the swaps are easily made.</p>
<h3>The Razors</h3>
<p>Instead of using and throwing out razors, we've created a range of stainless steel razors that will last for years, feel luxurious and heavy in your hand and that have double edged blades for an incredibly clean cut. When it does reach the end of its life it’s fully recyclable, so it creates no waste.</p>
<p>We also just quickly want to touch on your wallet for a second here, because the initial investment of a zero waste razor is going to pay off so quickly. The replacement blades come in packs of ten and are only €3, so imagine how much you can save in a lifetime with this single swap. </p>
<h3>The Dish Brush &amp; Pot Brush</h3>
<p>Those normal, bright coloured plastic dish brushes and scourers are a thing of the past. They can't be recycled by recycling plants and they are also pretty ugly. So we sat down to create our own wooden dish brush with replaceable head so you can keep using your handle, lowering your waste &amp; footprint even further. The dish brush is made entirely out of wood, metal, a bit of cotton for the string and plant bristles. The pot bruhs is made entirely out of wood and coconut bristles, making it fully biodegradable.</p>
<h3>Biodegradable Sponges</h3>
<p>Our biodegradable sponges are made with hemp for the soft side and coconut fibres for the scouring pad. It’s the first fully biodegradable kitchen sponge that has both a soft side and a scouring pad. And where normal kitchen sponges are made with plastic, shed microplastics into the environment and are not recyclable, our Mos Eco sponges are made with plant fibres only and are fully biodegradable.</p>
<h3>Silicone Lids </h3>
<p>Cling film is a huge polluter. It’s used a lot, it is single use by nature, recycling plants don’t recycle it and it sheds microplastics into the environment. SIlicone on the other hand reverts back into its harmless ingredients when burned: amorphous silica, carbon dioxide, and water vapor (unlike plastic which releases toxins when burned). Whilst still being able to endure extreme fluctuations in temperatures from very cold to very hot, but without melting, cracking or otherwise degrading and shedding. It's the perfect swap for cling film. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We fully understand that not everyone is in a position (right now) to help fund our production round. That's absolutely fine! Here are some other ways you could help us in the right direction: </p>
<ul>

We gave it our all and our last.  We maxed out credit cards and shook our heads many days trying to figure out how we were ever going to make the monthly payments, but we kept pressing forward because we believed otherwise.

We will make public our measured progress so that you can see the impact you are making around the globe. As a project of the United Nations Business Hub, we believe if every person and every nation unites to combat the climate crisis, we can successfully fulfill the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.SNEAK PEAK @ The Future of WHOLEROLL in many different colors. We are ""Earth Conscious and People Committed"" preserving nature and the future of the next generation.             THE VISION OF WHOLEROLL. WHY IS USING ENVIROFRIENDLY TISSUE SO IMPORTANT?RECYCLE10 is our vision to mobilize a global community.  Our goal is to educate the population on the benefits of using WHOLEROLL and to transition 10% of the global population from using virgin pulp and to begin using WHOLEROLL 100% recycled Eco-bath tissue. When we reach our goal we will have saved and planted hundreds of millions of trees. Why is using ecofriendly toilet paper, saving trees and keeping the oceans clean so important? It is important because deforestation is a contributor to global warming and climate change. Our planets oceans and forests are key to a sustainable future for all life on Earth. Trees are valuable resources for the planet because they absorb carbon emissions out of the air.  When we take care of Mother Earth, this leads to a future that includes breathable air, dependable weather patterns, drinkable water and the survival of ecosystems. Saving the Environment-Our mission is to help end deforestation and combat climate change using WHOLEROLL. We will plant a tree for every subscription box purchased. The next generation is the future and we intend to be apart of preserving their future.                        Saving you time and money- Grocery shopping can be a task and we definitely realize that.  WHOLEROLL will be delivered to your front door saving you money, saving you time while we are also saving the environment and We think that's pretty cool.  Our product is not about bears, kittens and flying babies. Our product is about people, the moms and dads and their children, this planet and our mission to preserve it for future generations. WHOLEROLL is an ecofriendly 2 ply 500 count septic safe bathroom tissue that is affordable, soft, beautifully embossed and Made in America. Each roll is individually wrapped in an emerald green world map paper representing our global mission to reach the world with our tissues.WHOLEROLL means to ""completely move forward"" and that is what our team at WHOLEROLL has done. We surveyed people all over the globe to find out what is most important to them in a bathroom tissue. We gathered data and information that was important to us and in line with the sustainable mission of the company. Our product is made from high quality fibers sourced from pre and post consumer materials.Tested and approved. We're leaving no stone unturned  in order to bring you the best on the market and best for the planet.Sustainability is the cornerstone of the culture of WHOLEROLL and sustainability is not something we do. It's who we are. We were very selective in developing a partnership with a manufacturer. We decided to only partner with a manufacturer that held the same values, commitment and practices that we hold on sustainability. A manufacturer that is LEED certified and whose tissues are Green Seal approved. We aim to be one of the responsible consumer goods companies that will ensure that the products we are selling are not contributing to deforestation or to any type of environmental damage.                  Thank you for joining us and embracing the vision.  When you receive your reward, remember its not just about tissue. Every movement needs pioneers and that is who you are. You are a pioneer in the country in which you live making early waves by choosing a sustainable solution that benefits the planet, your country and the future of the next generation. Limited Edition ""Camouflage Collection"" (only for backers never to be made again) - We are creating a one of a kind limited edition World Map Combat Collection for all of our backers.  The combat collection represents the fight we are in to help end deforestation and combat climate change. It represents you as a pioneer believing in the global vision to preserve the earth.          OUR BHAG-Big Hairy Audacious Goal-Yes ""WE GO APE TO SAVE THE PLANET""-We have established a project called Recycle10. Our goal is to transition 10% of the global population from using virgin pulp tissue( 98% of the tissues on retail market shelves) which is made from full grown mature trees that manufacturers chop down and to begin using WHOLEROLL; Our sustainable brand that will be delivered to your front door saving you money, saving you time while saving the environment.   Check out the growth of our tree below.  See how the idea for our product has grown. How did it begin? It began with a mom who had a house full of boys who never put the roll on the spool. She knew there had to be a better way and that's when she had an ""Aha"" moment. She thought what if there was a quick way to insert the roll. Convenience is what they needed. So she looked at the spindle and the tissue roll and said what if they were made together as one piece.  So she decided to call the new product ""WHOLEROLL."" Needless to say WHOLEROLL is now patent pending. But, while in product development, she learned that 98% of the bathroom tissue on retail shelves was made from the virgin pulp of mature full grown trees that were being chopped down, and she also learned that the average family of four chops down three trees a year for bathroom tissue usage. Shocked by that percentage, she decided to give up her own favorite brand and create a brand that would be more beneficial to the earth and the next generation.  FROM THE TEAMWe are so excited to share our project with you that we have been working on for 2 years now. And yes we learned a lot on this journey. There is no project ever worth attempting that will not go unchallenged, and yes we were challenged. We were ignored by investors, laughed out of meeting rooms and even challenged by some manufacturers who thought we were biting off more than we could chew. But we didn't quit. We gave it our all and our last.  We maxed out credit cards and shook our heads many days trying to figure out how we were ever going to make the monthly payments, but we kept pressing forward because we believed otherwise. We are here today against the odds committed to making a difference and regardless of the bumps in the road, as you can see we still had fun making and bringing our project to you. We are creating a very unique bathroom tissue made with the perfect blend of high quality post consumer fibers. It is a one of a kind bathroom tissue that is uniquely soft, beautifully embossed with the WHOLEROLL logo and some will be in a world map print that speaks ""Good for me and Good for the planet.""  If we are successfully funded, the funds will go towards our very first production run of WHOLEROLL. With your support, this will be possible and we say ""Thank you for believing in us and for investing in the planet and the future of the next generation.""  Also a special thanks to
 family and friends who gave us much encouragement and feedback, 
 to the people we surveyed all over the globe who told us what they wanted in a bathroom tissue-softness, sustainability and affordable 
 a special thanks to the UN Business Hub(our project connector on the Hub)for their commitment to the SDG's 
and to ""The Arbor Day Foundation"" who we look forward to working with in our ""One Box One Tree"" Commitment to help fulfill the Sustainable Development Goals and tackle the crisis of climate change.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>After my son suffered a fall from his crib, I was desperate to find a way to keep him safe, if he ever tried to climb again. He was too young to transition to a bed, and I couldn't bear the idea of doing nothing. I scoured the internet for a way to cushion any future fall, and to my dismay, there was nothing available.  </p>
<p>We were obviously very concerned about our son after he fell, and even the doctors at the hospital were unable to recommend anything to help us.</p>
<p>I created the DreamCatcher to give parents an option to keep their child safer, without using unsafe crib tents or makeshift tools.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">We need clean indoor air</h3>
<p>That's why we, Terry and Megan developed Ventcenters. Together we have 30 years of construction experience in both new and remodel. We are a mother and daughter team and family is our priority. A major issue facing our health is air quality, especially in our homes . Frustrated by the current filtration that we have available for our homes we came up with a no brainer way to fix it. Our product is a simple replacement part for the current vent register you currently have in your house. But wait, this vent cover has a basket that contains a medical grade filter and a re-designed top vent that actually pushes air into the room where you need it.</p>
<p>No Apps, Batteries, or Computers<strong>....It's Important to Be the Smartest Thing In Your House.</strong></p>
<p>We need your help! Buy making a contribution or pre purchasing a vent you will help us fund additional sizes of vents and filter baskets. The molds needed to produce our product are very expensive and limit the sizes we can offer. We will also be able to advertise and let everyone know that such an easy, affordable and beneficial product exists. </p>
<p>You can be part of an amazing revolution in healthy indoor air. Air purifiers only clean the air that finds its way to the purifier. Let's not even talk about how expensive they are, the additional electricity, or maintenance. By installing our vents, 99.9% of air passing though our antimicrobial filter is purifying  pollutants as small as 0.6 Microns every time your HVAC system is running!</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Why is this filter better?</h2>
<p>Our proprietary filter contains an <strong>antimicrobial</strong> that will prevent  mold, spores or mildew from growing inside you vents and stop them dead in their tracks.The loftiness of the filter design also allows air to pass through effortlessly while providing  99.9% filtration at a medical level. Our filter will catch pollutants as small as<strong> .06 Microns</strong>, The standard furnace filter only traps pollutants at<strong> 8 microns</strong>, that's if you can keep your furnace filter in place. Current furnace filters flop around and do a poor job of filtration. Since filtration is only as good as it's containment, we developed our Ventcenters basket to hold the filter in place for premium filtration.The top of the filter has a slightly tacky substance that will hold all the debris and pollutants that fall in your vents and prevent them from recirculating when the air is introduced. The sides of the filter will not be encased providing even more filtration. By changing the Ventcenters filter every 3-4 months you will be providing your family with the purist air available.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">The Ventcenters Basket System</h2>
<p>Unlike current vent covers today that push air to the side and down, our newly angled top directs air at a 45 degree angle up and out into the room to be conditioned. Our new Ventcenters design is also easy to open and close when needed.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1510798568/lwrjmprlae3znahr42hk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our patent pending design for the 'Lesich Vent' was created to hold our filter in place with minimal interference. This system has performed so well in testing we are just leaving the prototypes in our homes until we can make more! The <strong>Lesich Vent</strong> will be constructed out of a FLAX Poly resin. After the flax seeds are harvested and the flax oil is made, there is enormous waste of this fiber in America. We will be using this fiber because of its renewability, eco friendliness, and natural antimicrobial properties. Flax fiber is also incredibly strong which we need for the vent top. The top of the Lesich Vent will be a strong as the metal ones currently in homes. The benefit our material is we will be able to offer a selection of colors, eliminate the rust and flaking paint associated with the old metal vents, and be able to open and close the vents with ease.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">It's a great idea, just make it!</h2>
<p>We are asking for this funding to move forward with the manufacturing of the molds for all of the different sizes of vents in your home. By supporting us you will learn more about the air system in your home, be one of the first to own one of these life changing Ventcenters, and begin the movement for better and healthier indoor air quality at an affordable price!

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Impact with your help</h2>
<p>The fact is we are spending more time indoors. Allergy, asthma rates and weird killer viruses are at an all time high. The average house size has increased by an average of 1000 sq. ft. since 1972 but nothing has been done to address the HVAC system. The building code was also changed that year making our houses harder to ventilate. It's like hitting the recirculation button in your car. Gross! We have launched a campaign to educate everyday people on how their homes work and the issue of poor indoor air quality but, we need your help to make sure that all people can afford to have purified air in their homes.<strong> 1 in 11 children and 1 in 12 adults</strong> suffer with breathing issues.

<p>Q:Women developing construction products, that's a mans world.</p>
<p>A:We have a combined  experience level of 30years in construction and we are respected and considered experts in our fields.</p>
<p>Q:If it's that simple, why hasn't anyone invented this yet?</p>
<p>A:Innovations in construction have been stagnant for many years, you may say ""it's a rusty bolt to turn"". Innovations usually come from perfecting the way it's been done versus the way it should be done. Everyone that has been involved or heard of our product has been helpful and enthusiastic. From Lawyers to Engineers we are supported. Now we need you!</p>
<p>Q:Why Terry and Megan?</p>
<p>A:Above all our professional training, we are mothers, pet owners and we clean our own homes. Kids out sick from school, doctors appointments, MEDICATIONS (so expensive!), We are driven and passionate about this new way to help us all breathe easier and better. We don't take NO for an answer and we will work day and night,(or until we fall asleep at the table and hit the floor, that actually happened) to bring this to market! </p>
<p>Q: Where are you going to make these fantastic vents?</p>
<p>A:AMERICA,that's right! All material from the Flax sourced from Wisconsin to the filters made in Indiana to the Vent basket fabricator here in Colorado. As a Veteran this is extremely important to us.</p>

From Lawyers to Engineers we are supported. Now we need you!
Q:Why Terry and Megan?
A:Above all our professional training, we are mothers, pet owners and we clean our own homes. Kids out sick from school, doctors appointments, MEDICATIONS (so expensive!), We are driven and passionate about this new way to help us all breathe easier and better. We don't take NO for an answer and we will work day and night,(or until we fall asleep at the table and hit the floor, that actually happened) to bring this to market! 
Q: Where are you going to make these fantastic vents?
A:AMERICA,that's right! All material from the Flax sourced from Wisconsin to the filters made in Indiana to the Vent basket fabricator here in Colorado. As a Veteran this is extremely important to us.

<p><span>As we sit in the air-conditioned comfort of our homes and vehicles, across the globe our brave and often heroic American men and women serving in the US Armed Forces are sacrificing their lives and comforts to protect and defend us and this nation day and night.  They never consider themselves heroes they do it out of love for this country, and for each other.  In today’s combat environment the conditions are always extreme.  From 115 plus degrees in the desert on one side of the world, to hot and humid environments that would melt you and me on the other side, not to mention the hard and harsh conditions of training.  It is just unbelievable what they go through beyond being fired at. They never ask for anything in return.  </span></p>Heat is something that our troops struggle with.  Safety and effectiveness in extreme heat is a constant topic of discussion. Our troops are at risk all the time due to heat exhaustion.  In the combat environment they have to push themselves to the limit for us all.<p></p> </div><div>

<p><span>As stated in the video above.  While at Fort Bragg NC, home of the 82nd Airborne Division and Special Forces, this spring we got to meet many of our military heroes.  We were invited there by the 82nd Airborne Division Association.  After a few hours of military training out at Sicily Drop Zone our team got to meet these troops and had the opportunity to pass out Frosty Towels®.  After an initial macho reticence, the reception of this simple gift was outstanding and unbelievable,  If you could have seen their eyes like we did.  If you could have seen the excitement on their faces and heard it in their voices, you would have done anything to help them.  You would stop reading right now and make a donation. </span></p>
<p>Here are some of the things they said over and over: <b>""Wow these are amazing!"",  ""How do we get them?"",  “Where do we get them?"", ""When can we get more?""</b></p>I left there with an emotional determination and one thought:  “If these men and women can sacrifice their lives for me and my family, if they can put themselves through these kinds of conditions, then we can figure out a way to get these towels into the hands of the troops”.  To make this happen, We need you! They need you!</div><div>

82<sup>nd</sup>
Airborne Division Association, Inc. is chartered by congress to be the
preeminent Airborne Association for all serving and veteran troopers, their
families, and friends of the Airborne Brotherhood. <br/>

</div>
<div>Frosty Towel® is the only patented natural instant cooling towel in the market place. It uses special technology to cool you down in moments and help with your core body temperature as well.  We use natural plant oils and extracts infused into a cotton towel that lowers the temperature of the towels to 64 degrees on average to begin with.  It comes in a re-sealable package and is reusable. To learn more we have provided two short videos below.</div>

</div></div>","The Need 
As we sit in the air-conditioned comfort of our homes and vehicles, across the globe our brave and often heroic American men and women serving in the US Armed Forces are sacrificing their lives and comforts to protect and defend us and this nation day and night.  They never consider themselves heroes they do it out of love for this country, and for each other.  In today’s combat environment the conditions are always extreme.  From 115 plus degrees in the desert on one side of the world, to hot and humid environments that would melt you and me on the other side, not to mention the hard and harsh conditions of training.  It is just unbelievable what they go through beyond being fired at. They never ask for anything in return.  Heat is something that our troops struggle with.  Safety and effectiveness in extreme heat is a constant topic of discussion. Our troops are at risk all the time due to heat exhaustion.  In the combat environment they have to push themselves to the limit for us all. 



As stated in the video above.  While at Fort Bragg NC, home of the 82nd Airborne Division and Special Forces, this spring we got to meet many of our military heroes.  We were invited there by the 82nd Airborne Division Association.  After a few hours of military training out at Sicily Drop Zone our team got to meet these troops and had the opportunity to pass out Frosty Towels®.  After an initial macho reticence, the reception of this simple gift was outstanding and unbelievable,  If you could have seen their eyes like we did.  If you could have seen the excitement on their faces and heard it in their voices, you would have done anything to help them.  You would stop reading right now and make a donation. 
Here are some of the things they said over and over: ""Wow these are amazing!"",  ""How do we get them?"",  “Where do we get them?"", ""When can we get more?""I left there with an emotional determination and one thought:  “If these men and women can sacrifice their lives for me and my family, if they can put themselves through these kinds of conditions, then we can figure out a way to get these towels into the hands of the troops”.  To make this happen, We need you! They need you!


 Letter from the Desert 
Here is a letter from a 1st Lieutenant after coming back from a mission in the desert: 

I hope you can see that this is a very special campaign.  You can put a smile on the face of an active duty military hero and make their day a little more comfortable.  I believe it is the least we can do for them...
  
We need YOU!



 
We need you. Our troops need you.  We cannot do this without you.  You are vital to getting these Frosty Towels into the hands of our troops. 
Please support our troops.  Please help them get a Frosty Towel®. 
Here is how: 

Make a donation - (you can donate any amount you feel led to or choose one of the donation perks to the right)
Email all of your family, friends, and associates to share how they can support our troops
Post on your FACEBOOK page several times over the next few weeks
Encourage others you know to donate
Share this campaign using the Indiegogo sharing tools
Use the hashtag #coolourtroops on Instagram and Twitter
Over the next two weeks re-email all of your family, friends, and associates several times
For all that our heroes do for you and all of us please take the time to share this campaign with as many people as you can….it will only take you a few minutes...it is the least we can all do. 
  



  How this will Benefit You  
When you make a donation today you will know in your heart that you have done something very special to bless one or more of our brave men and women who are willing to lay down their lives for us.  
When they are somewhere on this planet in the worst of conditions; hot, sweaty, and exhausted, thanks to you, they will get a Frosty Towel®.  Once they open it up, it will get super cold.  At that point they will wipe down and put it on their neck or head.  As soon as they do, they will get a huge smile on their face and they will know that you appreciate them.  I promise you, they will be grateful.  So please donate today. 


How Frosty Towel® Gets to the Troops
82nd Airborne Division Association and their chapters around the USA.
82nd
Airborne Division Association, Inc. is chartered by congress to be the
preeminent Airborne Association for all serving and veteran troopers, their
families, and friends of the Airborne Brotherhood. 
  The Goals
To build a team with all of you to help get Frosty Towels into our hero's hands and make their lives a little better by helping to bring a level of cooling comfort to our troops, and reduce the stress of heat. 
We want to raise enough funds over all to donote over 100,00 Frosty Towels to our US Military Heroes over the next 10 months (with the ability to ship some as soon as September).  If we can get to 50,000 towels plus, we will also be donating to the Warrior Alliance in Atlanta, GA. that works with wounded verterans, to the 82nd Airborne Division Association (See below to learn more).


It is important to us that we give back.  The initial funds raised will go to the production of Frosty Towels for our troops.  As people donate more the cost of production will go down and we will be able to donate even more towels. Remaining excess funds will be donated to the Warrior Alliance of Atlanta, GA. and to the 82nd Airborne Division Association.  (for more information about these organizations please go to the bottom)

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Introducing the patented Simple Stir, the world’s first microwave food cover that uses the motive power of your microwave turntable to stir your meal! The Simple Stir is designed to sit on the floor of your microwave outside the turntable. A detachable stirring paddle is held motionless by the rectangular cover and the turntable does all the work for you. Your food is now just as hot in the middle as on the sides.</p>
<p>For dishes that don’t require stirring, simply use the Simple Stir like a regular microwave food cover. Since the Simple Stir doesn’t sit on top of your plates and bowls like a typical cover, you won’t have to clean it as often.</p>
<p>The Simple Stir works great for:</p>
<p>- Sauces<br/>- Soups<br/>- Cheese and Bean dips<br/>- Pasta<br/>- Frozen Corn and Peas<br/>- Pizza<br/>- Anything you microwave!</p>
<p>We are raising funds to start our business. This money will allow us to produce the first round of Simple Stirs, properly test the market, and set us up to approach the large retail distributors. We intend to have the first round of production complete within three months of our successful Indiegogo campaign.</p>
<p>This company currently consists of one person. I am an accountant by day and inventor by night, an active member of Mensa, a Rotarian, and an Eagle Scout. I have worked on this design for the last few years, spending whatever time and money I could scrape together to make this happen. I believe that our newest design will make a useful and stylish addition to your kitchen.</p>
<p>Thank you for helping me bring my idea to life!</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I have spent several years designing the Simple Stir to be an elegant, sturdy, and convenient kitchen tool. I received a utility patent on the design in 2015. I have secured several quotes from manufacturers to prevent delays in production.

all those that contributed to the success of the Living Shelter campaign PART 1 (<a href=""https://igg.me/at/living-shelter"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://igg.me/at/living-shelter</a>).
</p>
<p>We are
honoured to announce that, with the great support of our backers, the first <b>1:1 Living Shelter prototype</b>
is now exhibited at the <b>Architecture Venice
Biennale 2016</b>. </p>
<p>Until
November 2016, more than 200,000 visitors will be able to
experiment the capsule at <b>Palazzo Mora,
terrace level 1</b> within the exhibition <i>Time
– Space – Existence</i> hosted by the Non-Profit Organization <i>Global Art Affairs Foundation</i>. </p>

<p>Along
the prototype construction process and the opening of the <b>Architecture Venice Biennale</b>, our team received fantastic feedbacks.
Institutions, NGO, communities, designers, engineers and the public trust
Living Shelter to be a smart solution for disaster relief.</p>
<p>Our
team is <b>even more determined</b> to
bring its innovative solution in the disaster relief market and start to help
the communities in need.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>WHAT IS LIVING SHELTER?</b></p>
<p>Check-out
the Living Shelter PART 1 campaign to learn more about the genesis and features
of the Living Shelter: <a href=""https://igg.me/at/living-shelter"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://igg.me/at/living-shelter</a>.</p>
<p>The
prototype process and installation at the Venice Biennale is also documented on
the Facebook page: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Living-Shelter-855235037955574/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/Living-Shelter-855235037955574/</a></p>
<br/>
<p><b>IMPROVE THE FIRST VERSION OF THE PROTOTYPE</b></p>
<p>Prototyping
process helped us to identify where systems can be improved: better concealed
hinges and track system, optimization of primary structure, adjustment of the overall
height for more efficiency while deploying the shelter. Our team of designers
and engineers is already working on an <b>upgraded
and lighter version</b>. </p>
<br/>
<p><b>USE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY FOR FURNITURE </b></p>
<p>We
are convinced that the Living Shelter should provide what is currently the best
in term of innovation and design. With this mind, we have already started
exploring further the portable furniture system currently part of the flat-pack.
New technology such as <b>3D-printed and
light-weight composite materials</b> will increase stability without adding
extra weight. Design and systems will focus on ergonomic to meet the end-users
usages.<a href=""#_msocom_1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a></p>
<p>Our
team is currently revising the design of the portable set of furniture
including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>2 chairs<span></span>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>1 foldable bed<span></span>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>1 table for 6 pax,<span></span>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>1 kitchen counter<span></span>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>1 ladder to access to the rows of

</ul>

Those elements will
be <b>patented in Singapore</b> alongside the

<p><b>SHARE THE KNOWLEDGE WITH THE COMMUNITY</b></p>
<p>It’s crucial
to <b>enable people to work together
towards a common goal</b>. During the transitional phase, our team envisions to
transfer the 3D printing knowledge to the community. </p>
<p>Computer, software,
3D printer and materials could be sponsored with partners. Through workshops,
the community could <b>learn how to create
three-dimensional objects of everyday life and furniture</b>. Templates of
design could be provided as well as basics skills to create their own design. This
initiative could be part of a NGO program post disaster relief as a case study.
</p>
<br/>
<p><b>OUR GOAL</b></p>
<p>We’re
asking US $5,000 for: </p>
<ul><li>Portable furniture:<span></span><span><span></span></span>
</li></ul><ol>
<li>3D print samples of innovative
systems<span></span>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Prototyping to confirm the ergonomic
design<span></span>
</li>
<li>
<span><span></span></span>Produce 1 copy of each furniture</li>

all those that contributed to the success of the Living Shelter campaign PART 1 (https://igg.me/at/living-shelter).

We are
honoured to announce that, with the great support of our backers, the first 1:1 Living Shelter prototype
is now exhibited at the Architecture Venice
Biennale 2016. 
Until
November 2016, more than 200,000 visitors will be able to
experiment the capsule at Palazzo Mora,
terrace level 1 within the exhibition Time
– Space – Existence hosted by the Non-Profit Organization Global Art Affairs Foundation. 

Along
the prototype construction process and the opening of the Architecture Venice Biennale, our team received fantastic feedbacks.
Institutions, NGO, communities, designers, engineers and the public trust
Living Shelter to be a smart solution for disaster relief.
Our
team is even more determined to
bring its innovative solution in the disaster relief market and start to help
the communities in need.
WHAT IS LIVING SHELTER?
Check-out
the Living Shelter PART 1 campaign to learn more about the genesis and features
of the Living Shelter: https://igg.me/at/living-shelter.
The
prototype process and installation at the Venice Biennale is also documented on
the Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/Living-Shelter-855235037955574/

IMPROVE THE FIRST VERSION OF THE PROTOTYPE
Prototyping
process helped us to identify where systems can be improved: better concealed
hinges and track system, optimization of primary structure, adjustment of the overall
height for more efficiency while deploying the shelter. Our team of designers
and engineers is already working on an upgraded
and lighter version. 

USE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY FOR FURNITURE 
We
are convinced that the Living Shelter should provide what is currently the best
in term of innovation and design. With this mind, we have already started
exploring further the portable furniture system currently part of the flat-pack.
New technology such as 3D-printed and
light-weight composite materials will increase stability without adding
extra weight. Design and systems will focus on ergonomic to meet the end-users
usages.
Our
team is currently revising the design of the portable set of furniture
including:


2 chairs


1 foldable bed


1 table for 6 pax,


1 kitchen counter


1 ladder to access to the rows of
hammocks above the double bed


Those elements will
be patented in Singapore alongside the
overall Living Shelter©.
SHARE THE KNOWLEDGE WITH THE COMMUNITY
It’s crucial
to enable people to work together
towards a common goal. During the transitional phase, our team envisions to
transfer the 3D printing knowledge to the community. 
Computer, software,
3D printer and materials could be sponsored with partners. Through workshops,
the community could learn how to create
three-dimensional objects of everyday life and furniture. Templates of
design could be provided as well as basics skills to create their own design. This
initiative could be part of a NGO program post disaster relief as a case study.


OUR GOAL
We’re
asking US $5,000 for: 
Portable furniture:

3D print samples of innovative
systems


Prototyping to confirm the ergonomic
design


Produce 1 copy of each furniture
Sharing session with the community

Communication and research to find
partners and NGO to develop the workshop



Design and engineering
works are self-founded by our companies.

<p>When you press a button, it’s natural for the hand to shake a little. However, this phenomenon will become unignorable if you are trying to measure the distance to places such as a ceiling corner. You’ll have to focus on one particular point, which can be a little hard.</p>

<p>Fortunately, P7 features a <u>continuous measurement function</u>, it can rapidly get a series of distances and pick out the maximum and minimum measurements.

<p><b></b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>How does the technology work?</b></p>
<p>When the electrical supply is switched on, the liquid crystal molecules align themselves and the glass becomes instantly clear. When the power is off, the liquid crystal molecules scatter the light for a frosted effect.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Do Smart Section Blinds completely block the light?</b></p>
<p>Smart Section Blinds are translucent white or “frosted” when turned off. Switchable glass is never actually opaque. During the off state, Smart Section Blinds let in over 50% of visible light, but still block the view. It’s an ideal choice for small spaces like offices, bedrooms and bathrooms because it provides privacy on demand while allowing natural light to filter in.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>What is the difference between Smart Section Blinds and Smart Blinds (Smart Film)?</b></p>
<p>The only difference is the degree of control. Smart Section Blinds virtually divide glass into stripes and blocks, and each section can be controlled separately, including their degree of opacity. Smart Blinds (Smart Film) block or adjust the opacity of an entire window. </p>
<p>

Smart Film instantly transforms transparent glass into a frosted blind with a simple on – off switch. Our electronic smart film applies to any glass window or partition to provide privacy and security.
Smart Film gives you a richer and more vibrant view of your environment, eliminating the need for traditional window coverings that collect dust and germs and clutter up your space.Smart Section Blinds use Smart Film technology to create unique, customizable blinds. Unlike Smart Blinds that cover your entire window all at once, Smart Section Blinds divide your glass surface into stripes that can be controlled independently. You can create horizontal stripes, vertical strips, or any variation to provide the perfect setting for any occasion.










Converts
your existing glass into Smart Glass


Delivers
instant privacy control automatically or with the touch of a button


Helps
make the most of your space


Improves
your view and enhances natural light


Reduces
the need for heating and cooling by up to 40%


Matches
your setting to your mood to suit any occasion


Boosts
the value of your home and improves the status of your business





Smart Section Blinds take Smart Film to a whole new level by adding an impressive degree of control. While Smart Film blocks an entire window at once, Smart Section Blinds virtually divide glass into stripes and blocks. Each section can be controlled separately, including their degree of opacity, so you have complete control over your smart glass.












You can control Smart Blinds with a simple switch, WiFi, timer, temperature, or a motion sensor. It also works with your existing home automation system.









This technology can also transform any glass into a high-definition television. In its opaque state it works as a rear projection screen to display video or images. 




This radical concept re-imagines how you can realize the potential of your space. Convert your entire window into an HDTV to showcase your products and tell stories about your company, your vision, and your community.


1) We have completed our final Smart Section Blinds prototype, and we’re ready to move into mass production. 
2) We are in the final stage of developing the control system that you’ll be able to operate by smart phone, timer, physical gestures, and a motion sensor.
3) We’ve created a low-voltage prototype, reducing voltage from 110 to 30 volts, dramatically increasing the product’s energy efficiency and ensuring optimal safety in all applications.Crowdfunding dollars will help us develop a wireless power supply that works over Wi-Fi, eliminating the need for traditional wiring that clutters up your space.

Wireless transmission technology transmits power via electromagnetic fields, which is perfect for a minimalist installation that looks great on windows, sliding doors, and glass doors.






For the past months we have been hard at work developing smart film, with the goal to bring natural light, privacy and security  to everyone.  
We launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds so that we can develop wireless power transfer technology, produce smart film in higher volumes, and bring the price down.  
Not in the position to make a financial contribution? Spread the word and share this idea with your friends and family. You can like us on Facebook, share the campaign on social media, or let others know about us by word of mouth. You can also become a distributor. This is a great option for existing window tinting companies who want to add to their product arsenal. 















We took the risk up front and delayed the launch of our campaign until we believed it was ready because we wanted to lessen the risk to our backers. We have a great team in place so we aren’t anticipating a lot of obstacles. When it comes to new technologies, nothing is certain, but we will face every challenge with the same tenacity and perseverance we’ve had from the start.







How does the technology work?
When the electrical supply is switched on, the liquid crystal molecules align themselves and the glass becomes instantly clear. When the power is off, the liquid crystal molecules scatter the light for a frosted effect.


Do Smart Section Blinds completely block the light?
Smart Section Blinds are translucent white or “frosted” when turned off. Switchable glass is never actually opaque. During the off state, Smart Section Blinds let in over 50% of visible light, but still block the view. It’s an ideal choice for small spaces like offices, bedrooms and bathrooms because it provides privacy on demand while allowing natural light to filter in.


What is the difference between Smart Section Blinds and Smart Blinds (Smart Film)?
The only difference is the degree of control. Smart Section Blinds virtually divide glass into stripes and blocks, and each section can be controlled separately, including their degree of opacity. Smart Blinds (Smart Film) block or adjust the opacity of an entire window. 


Why be an early adopter? What’s in it for me? 
Early adopters are the key initial supporters that help us make this project possible, and we’re ready to say thanks any way we can.





You get to purchase Smart Section Blinds at the lowest possible price


We’ll provide a guaranteed warranty to compensate for any possible faults


You will receive your product before we sell it anywhere else


You’ll become a preferred customer and receive lifetime preferences, including discounts of up to 40% on all future orders




What if I want to be a distributor or reseller? 
We’d love for you to get in touch. You can purchase our distributor pack for initial samples by emailing us at social@smartglasscountry.com. Please note that there will be a limited number of resellers for each territory, so act fast!


How many controllers do I need?
One controller can control up to 50 square ft.  
What is the
average price per window?




Most windows range from 32-36” in width and between 54-62” in height, which is approximately 9-14 square ft. per window. The average window would need 2-3 perks.

How many square metres is 5 square feet?
5 square feet=0.46 square metres. One square metres=10.74 square feet. 

How do I measure my required quantity?
Measure the height and length of the glass, allowing for a 1/8” (3.175 mm) installation tolerance.


Can Smart Section Blinds technology be applied to my existing windows?
Smart Section Blinds are manufactured with a self-adhesive cling layer on one side, so you can easily apply it to your window just like the screen protector on your phone. We prepare the Smart Film for your specific glass size, you just need to peel and stick.


Can the level of opacity in Smart Section Blinds be adjusted?
Yes, you can adjust opacity by using a dimmer or our controller.


Can I get Smart Section Blinds in different colors?
A variety of colors and tints may be incorporated into Smart Section Blinds to achieve a decorative effect. We have white and dark grey as our base colors.


How do you clean Smart Section Blinds?
Smart Section Blinds should be cleaned with a soft cloth and gentle cleanser. Avoid harsh chemicals and sharp instruments. Be sure to remove liquids from any edges that may have collected during the cleaning process.


Can you cut holes in Smart Section Blinds?
Yes, you can cut holes, cut-outs, and create custom shapes.


How do I convert my glass into a high-definition TV?
Two technologies are available: rear projection (using a projector and Smart Section Blinds as a screen), and transparent LED display. Please contact us for more information.


How does this technology save energy and the earth?
Smart Section Blinds save energy in a few different ways:





Provides privacy without blocking natural light


Reduces heat gain due to sunlight, lowering air conditioning costs to save on electricity


Easy to clean with no chemicals required




How do I set it up?
Similar to any electronic device, you plug Smart Section Blinds into a power outlet and it’s ready to go. You can also connect to the controller or download our app from the Apple Store or Google Play to control it from your smartphone.


How can you make this technology so affordable?
We can keep our costs low based on volume. Because we’re selling directly to consumers, we don’t need to build in retail margins that substantially add to the product cost.


How do I integrate this technology into my existing home automation?
We have documented our API and it should be ready for release sometime later in 2016 for existing home automation developers to develop on our system. 


What platform does Smart Section Blinds support?
Smart Section Blinds support iOS, Android, and iWatch. These platforms will be ready before delivery. 


Where can Smart Section Blinds be shipped?
Smart Section Blinds will be shipped worldwide as long as United States Postal Service (USPS) or Canada Post supports delivery to that location.


What is the warranty for Smart Section Blinds?
Smart Section Blinds will include a one-year limited warranty. We will do a one-for-one exchange for any faulty product within a one-year period.",17.0,2,"1 Campaign

No more screen time conflicts! Are you, like us, parents who experience conflicts about your child’s screen time and looking for solutions? In today’s increasingly connected and digital world, the answer is most likely ‘yes’. Search no more, the SCRIIN WiFi router is coming to town to solve these conflicts and help every family member be aware of their screen time and achieve a healthy balance. The SCRIIN WiFi removes the conflict - When the agreed screen time budget is up, the Internet at home shuts down for that individual. It’s time to take a break and do something else, like being physically active.  We ❤️ the internet and smartphones. Technology is amazing, and the technology of the modern age has made our lives overwhelmingly richer. The development of smartphones combined the Internet is a revolution that the SCRIIN team have been part of developing throughout our careers.   But there is a dark side. The technology revolution and the personalized screens we engage with the Internet make us lazy, sitting still too long. Making a generation unhealthy. Previous generations literally moved a marathon or more every week while today us and our children sit still in front of our screens during far too many of our waking hours. It is becoming a serious health problem both for children and adults. We need to develop a better balance between screen time and physical activity in our lives.   Balance screen time with physical activity. SCRIIN WiFi is built to help you and your children balance screen time with physical activity. This is how it works:1. Give your child (and yourself) a daily budget of screen time.Create accounts for all your family members and give each family member a daily screen time budget. Depending on age, the amount of screen time can differ.  2. Enable the device in the SCRIIN AppWhen your child wants to use a device at home, like the PS4, Xbox, or using the iPad or any device connected to SCRIIN WiFi, they can only enable the device or multiple devices through the SCRIIN App.  3. Get notifications before screen time is upThe SCRIIN App will notify your child when their screen time is coming to an end and finally shut down access to the Internet. The first notification comes 15 minutes before time is up, followed by warnings 5 minutes and then 1 minute before screen time is up. We think it is important to prepare for shutdown so children have time to say goodbye to their online friends.  4. Track your physical activityWith the SCRIIN App or the optional Activity Tracker, you can track you or your child’s physical activity. Use it to achieve balance between screen time and physical activity, and even unlock your Internet connection when you have reached a better balance. Progress circles show you how much time you have been physically active, and how much time you have spent with all your screens during a day.  For all family members. SCRIIN WiFi is built for all family members who have a smartphone. There are no complex settings. We make it simple for you and your children to manage your screen time in your own home.  Plug it in. Download the SCRIIN App. Go. We aim to make everything as easy as possible for you. Installation of the SCRIIN WiFi router is built for everyday people, not technicians. When you receive the SCRIIN WiFi router, plug it in and connect it easily with the SCRIIN App. The App will take you through some simple steps to get your whole family connected.  It is stable and secure. Built to the highest technical standards. Made for high-speed connectivity.   Screen addiction - it really is a ‘thing’! Recent studies show a common thread - Screen time among children after school is dangerously high. Here in Sweden, 40% of adolescents use a screen 3 or more hours every day after school. We still do not know the full effects of increased screen time, but it makes us sit still too many hours per day and these leads to health problems through inactivity. Recent studies also show a correlation between the overuse of social media and anxiety and depression. Social media and video games are designed to make us addicted. They give us instant gratification and our brains love it, while we all understand rationally that delayed gratification is what is good for us. Exercise gives us delayed gratification while eating sweets gives us an instant kick. Which one is really better for us and our children?  Children are the future. Let's make them smarter. Our children are the future. Yeah, it’s a cliché, but it doesn’t make it any less true. Every generation seems to be a bit smarter than the previous one.

Two of the first corian AnZas arrived in the studio last week! We have been testing the performance of one of them, and wanted to share the unboxing of the other machine. 

 


Welcome to AnZa! The AnZa espresso machine is the lovechild of two not-so-strange bedfellows: a professional design studio and an espresso repair shop, both sharing the same space in Berkeley, California.Born out of passion for good coffee and boredom with the default espresso machine vernacular, the AnZa brings new life and love to your countertop. The AnZa is not your typical appliance, collecting dust on your countertop. Concrete. corian. Wood. Steel. Brass. Glass. These largely ordinary materials are not often found on espresso machines. But their application shows you don’t need to look far to find design elements that create a dramatically new experience—emotional, practical, or otherwise. The result is a spectacular espresso machine, and an unparalleled conversation piece.AnZa in ConcreteAnZa in Concrete offers Brutalist overtures at once softened by contrasting white ceramic accents.   AnZa in corian In corian, AnZa playfully extends the ubiquitous kitchen counter material to a countertop appliance itself.  Whatever you choose, both models offer the same streamlined user-experience, resulting in a beautifully pulled espresso shot.There has been surprisingly little innovation in the world of espresso machines, despite our obsession with interior architecture and kitchen design. Anza’s added value comes from its material choices and accessible functionality. AnZa delivers a cafe-quality experience in a fashion unlike any other appliance—truly earning its bit of valuable real estate on your kitchen countertop. The AnZa might not be technically unique, but the design and material choices of the AnZa make it something completely new, a conversation piece that aims to refashion the industry of home espresso machines.Globally Featured Publications:   Our HistoryA few years ago, designers at Montaag set out on a creative experiment. What could it look like to treat an appliance like a work of art—without sacrificing quality? Based on the design team’s love of coffee, and our shared office space with an espresso repair shop, the AnZa design process kicked off.   Our team sought inspiration from the many workshops and salvage yards surrounding us in the San Francisco Bay Area. We played endlessly with material, color, and tactility. Ultimately, we landed on product design principles that emphasize honest materials and intuitive functionality.Design process After many rounds of prototypes (and a display of our working model at Selfridges department store in London), we have fine-tuned the technical specs, and secured a full-scale manufacturer overseas. How easy is it to use AnZa? Concerned about the specs? Not to worry. In partnership with the espresso repair shop that shares our office, the AnZa team has benchmarked technical quality against other high-end espresso machines. The AnZa works as beautifully as it looks. The AnZa offers an intuitive interface to deliver delicious espresso shots every time. If you’ve never pulled a shot of espresso before and want to learn, here is a short tutorial that will show you the gist from one of our working AnZa prototypes.

We worked diligently with coffee experts throughout the product design process to create the best product for coffee, but at the same time we wanted to make sure we built something that worked well for our tea loving friends too!The Thero Magic Mug uses some of the same technology that keeps rocket ships from overheating on launch and reentry to control the temperature of your coffee. Our special space-grade material is designed to absorb excess heat while your drink is above 140 degrees Fahrenheit, quickly bringing it down to that perfect drinking temperature. Then, when your hot drink falls below that perfect temperature, it will release that stored up heat back into your drink. This way you get to savor and enjoy your drink instead of gulping it down. The coolest thing about this aerospace material is that it does this all on its own. No sensors or electricity required! Just rinse with cool water in between uses to reset the material and let it get rid of any heat it might still be holding on to. Risks and ChallengesBringing any product to market can present challenges and unfortunately, delays can occur due to unforeseen circumstances. One possible reason for the potential delay is the holiday rush. We have already identified several manufacturers and wish to complete our order before the holiday season in the OEM's country. Our current timeline has 1-2 months of wiggle room for potential delays and we are trying our best to bring Thero to you ASAP.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p style=""font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', 'Myriad Pro', 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: lighter; font-size: 14px;"">Why the name Soap</p>
<p style=""color: #000000; font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', 'Myriad Pro', 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: lighter; font-size: 12px;"">The name Soap came from the early days of the product, when we originally were designing a product that helped parents keep their home networks clean. We soon came to the realization that this was a much too narrow  concept as the market continued to tell us that the time for a universal network management app had arrived. But everyone loved the name Soap so much that we decided to keep it. </p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', 'Myriad Pro', 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: lighter; font-size: 14px;"">Directional Change </p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', 'Myriad Pro', 'DejaVu Sans Condensed', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-weight: lighter; font-size: 12px;"">As many of you know we originally were going to build a router running Android with a touch screen display.  We ended up having to make a difficult business decision due to cost and the length of time it was going to take to develop the product.  We of course are taking care of  our original backers, but we strongly believe that the path we are taking now is the right path to meeting the market demands for a universal network management application. We have humbly conceded our orignal  router manufacturing plans to those who do it best and have decided to partner with them instead of compete with them.This change is a win for everyone. </p>

Timeline 

About us
Why the name Soap
The name Soap came from the early days of the product, when we originally were designing a product that helped parents keep their home networks clean. We soon came to the realization that this was a much too narrow  concept as the market continued to tell us that the time for a universal network management app had arrived. But everyone loved the name Soap so much that we decided to keep it. 
Directional Change 
As many of you know we originally were going to build a router running Android with a touch screen display.  We ended up having to make a difficult business decision due to cost and the length of time it was going to take to develop the product.  We of course are taking care of  our original backers, but we strongly believe that the path we are taking now is the right path to meeting the market demands for a universal network management application. We have humbly conceded our orignal  router manufacturing plans to those who do it best and have decided to partner with them instead of compete with them.This change is a win for everyone. 
Where were located 








Our Soap office is located in Monument, CO just north of Colorado Springs and south of Denver.

<br/><h3>The Campaign

 </h3>
<p>My name is Meiyi Chen and I'm based in Scotland. I'm currently 
working together with Jacob raising funds to begin production of the 
Thumbs Up Brewer. The minimum production quantity for the first batch of the Thumbs Up Brewer is 1000 units. The prototypes have been made, tested and refined. All is left is to raising enough money to fund the production!</p>

</h1>
<p>The core concept of the Thumbs Up 
Brewer was inspired when Jacob was visiting Stock Bridge during a trip 
to Edinburgh. He fell in love with second hand charity shops dotted 
through out the street and went back there over and over again through 
out his visit. Although I can never get my head around on how second 
hand shops can lead to inspiration, but then again, I'm not an inventor 
or an artist...</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>I have had numerous discussions with Jacob regarding the risks and 
challenges with the production of the Thumbs Up Brewer. Jacob is very 
confident as the manufacture process and production line have already 
been fully tested and refined in the initial limited trial production of
 Thumbs-up Mini Brewers. But there is still the concern with large scale
 production of the larger Thumbs-up Brewer, it will be more prone to 
risks and process failures, which could delay production.
<br/>Thus in our case, the biggest risk and challenge will be meeting the promised deadlines. 
<br/>We believe that we have given ourselves plenty of time with our 
promised delivery dates. But if we do run in to any problems which will 
result in possible delays, what we can promise is that it will be 
CLEARLY COMMUNICATED to all the backers, and no one will be left in the 
dark wondering when will they ever get their rewards :)</p>

challenges with the production of the Thumbs Up Brewer. Jacob is very 
confident as the manufacture process and production line have already 
been fully tested and refined in the initial limited trial production of
 Thumbs-up Mini Brewers. But there is still the concern with large scale
 production of the larger Thumbs-up Brewer, it will be more prone to 
risks and process failures, which could delay production.
Thus in our case, the biggest risk and challenge will be meeting the promised deadlines. 
We believe that we have given ourselves plenty of time with our 
promised delivery dates. But if we do run in to any problems which will 
result in possible delays, what we can promise is that it will be 
CLEARLY COMMUNICATED to all the backers, and no one will be left in the 
dark wondering when will they ever get their rewards :)



Any questions or thought? Please leave a comment or send me a message :)",19.0,2,"1 Campaign

Our cashmere blend includes cashmere mix with three versatile fabrics - Rayon, Nylon, and Acrylic - which allow this specific cashmere-blend to have stretch (for ease of comfort and movement), smoothness, and enable easy-care properties (machine-washable, dryer-safe on low, wrinkle resistant). For this blend, we use 12gg (gauge) premium cashmere to make our clothing yarn finer, smoother, and more tense for durability. As a comparison, most mass-market brands use 7gg - 9gg cashmere to reduce cost. At SOFIE & NATE, we use 12gg to 16gg designer-grade cashmere in our products. Hence, our proprietary cashmere-blend fabric will feel wonderfully soft and luxe for hand feel.Our cashmere-blend fabric has been registered with the Application of Design Registry on 9 August 2016.  This process takes 60-90 days for the certification.  Until we get the certification, we cannot share the material composition percentage due to fear of copies.  Thank you for your kind understanding with regards to intellectual properties matters.If you need sizing help, please feel free to email us directly at customercare@sofieandnate.com We will be glad to help! HOW DO WE KEEP OUR PRICES LOW?At SOFIE & NATE, we work directly with a cashmere farm family in Inner Mongolia, and avoid any middleman.  Therefore, we deliver our high-quality cashmere-based products to you at a fraction of the traditional luxury price.  No middleman takes a cut.  All the savings go directly to you. Our cashmere farm family partner is located in Inner Mongolia, China. They have been around for 70+ years and it's a family business passed down several generations. The farmers comb the hair (no shearing), hand-sort, and clean the hair at their own farm. They also spin the yarn there too. From there, it goes to our manufacturer in China who knows and has worked with the cashmere farm family for a long time. Our manufacturer is a WRAP-certified (Worldwide Responsible Accredited Production) factory in China. WRAP is an independent, objective, non-profit team of global social compliance experts dedicated to promoting safe, lawful, humane and ethical manufacturing around the world through certification and education.Please kindly rest assure that despite being a small start-up, Sofie & Nate takes great care and pride in working with people who care. OUR STORY  Based in sunny Los Angeles, California, SOFIE & NATE offers luxurious cashmere-based products at friendly prices. By combining our modern design aesthetics with HLS Cashmere™ fabric innovation in our products, SOFIE & NATE strives to create a new standard in cashmere clothing and accessories for cashmere-lovers worldwide.  Cashmere is our fabric of choice due to its softness and warmth properties, coupled with being light-weight and having a luxe hand feel. But… We really hate the way cashmere is traditionally designed and distributed. Our mission is to re-design cashmere-based products for our generation. We design with the modern women in mind. Afterall, at SOFIE & NATE, we are those women as well.  From eco-conscious, 100% dye-free natural cashmere to exceptionally easy-care cashmere-blends, we aim to make SOFIE & NATE’s luxurious cashmere products a staple for our everyday life. PRODUCTION & DELIVERY SCHEDULE    IMPORTANT:  WORLDWIDE SHIPPING – We ship worldwide through a 3rd-party courier.

<p>On the other hand, the method of turning the magnetic field into a wave of certain frequency has been proved to be effective. </p>
<p>There are many huge and expensive medical appliances using the high gauss magnetic wave, and those appliances are not available to many people because of their expensive cost. </p>
<p>However, the Super brain is not a medical appliance but a portable brain wave learning device using single 1.5 voltage battery. It is very economic because the battery consumption is slow and at the same time, it is an outstanding device for brain wave stimulation.</p>

No more old-age brain wave device using light and sound!
REX Super brain Unlike previous brain wave learning devices that indirectly induce the brain wave using sound and light, it turns the magnetic field as minute as the terrestrial magnetism into a wave of certain frequency and directly stimulates the brain wave into alpha, theta, or delta wave. 





REX Super brain Unlike previous brain wave learning devices that indirectly induce the brain wave using sound and light, it turns the magnetic field as minute as the terrestrial magnetism into a wave of certain frequency and directly stimulates the brain wave into alpha, theta, or delta wave. 

Previous brain wave learning devices using sound and light are going down due to their lack of effectiveness. 
On the other hand, the method of turning the magnetic field into a wave of certain frequency has been proved to be effective. 
There are many huge and expensive medical appliances using the high gauss magnetic wave, and those appliances are not available to many people because of their expensive cost. 
However, the Super brain is not a medical appliance but a portable brain wave learning device using single 1.5 voltage battery. It is very economic because the battery consumption is slow and at the same time, it is an outstanding device for brain wave stimulation.

If you want deep sleep, peace in mind, stress relieve, studying, concentration, and creativity, press a button and choose the mode you need. 
Sound and light brain wave learning devices were popular in 1990s and there were countless products released all over the world.
But now, after their lack of performance was found out, those devices are being kicked out from the market. Instead of sound and light, use the Super brain that directly and effectively stimulates the brain wave by using the magnetic wave.


REX super brain was introduced several press as below.








Deep sleep

Are you suffering from insomnia?    
Try out the delta wave.  





Meditation

Are you anxious because of uncertain future, overwhelming work, or mental stress?
Get some help from the alpha wave.  







 
 Rest






Learning

Studying, concentration, creativity...and do you want to use your brain to its maximum potential capacity? 
Try out the high-alpha wave.







Before using the super brain (almost no alpha wave)

five minutes after using the super brain (rapidly increased alpha wave status)


REX Super brain is crafted based on Dr. Robert O. Becker’s theory that both human beings and animals significantly react to the magnetic field.



 Super brain stimulates the brain wave by producing a specific harmless magnetic field from the main device to head band and creating high alpha wave, low alpha wave theta wave, and wave of delta wave

Even Albert Einstein, known as the biggest genius of all time, could not use his brain to the full potential.    
Then how can a human being use his/her brain to the maximum capability? 
The answer is in transforming the brain wave to alpha wave with the power of science. 


 Once the brain wave is changed into alpha wave with science.. it is easier to extract the unlimited potential that a brain has.. The brain of a human being, when the brain wave turns into alpha wave.. extracting the limitless hidden capability that was given by god is possible.


 When a brain wave becomes an alpha wave, not only concentration, creativity, studying capability, and memory power significantly develops but also mental stress goes away and peace in mind is created.


 A status that the brain is extremely active and studying capability, intuition, and creativity is increased to the maximum, is the alpha wave status.  


When the brain wave is in alpha wave status, the brain can demonstrate the maximum potential capability and when the brain wave changes into theta wave, brain goes into a sleeping mode.  


In a normal situation, human being’s brain wave is in beta wave status. If the brain wave is in beta wave, tension, agitation, anxiety and worries accumulate, and with such mental stress, they often damage your body and mind.  

However, once the brain wave turns into alpha wave, anti-stress hormone called beta-endorphin increases two to three times.
 As a result, it is scientifically known that the mental stress quickly goes away.    
And the brain wave turns into slow alpha wave and the brain enters the meditation status. 


The alpha status of brain is the best status for an ideal life of a human being. 

Therefore, no matter Western or Asian, the purpose of all meditation practices is about changing the brain wave to alpha wave. 


However, it is extremely difficult to freely control and get to such active status of the brain. 

Therefore, the research on how to reach the alpha status whenever we want to in a short amount of period has been practiced from long time ago. 


After different endeavors, several products were invented. Some of them, even though it is weak, actually succeeded in activating the brain.  Nevertheless, all of them use the method of stimulating either the user’s hearing or sight.   

Super brain has an outstanding efficiency because it stimulates the brain wave by creating a specific frequency wave in safe and harmless.

 Super brain is an outstanding portable brain wave learning device.Unlike a humongous medical machine that uses strong magnetic field.. it is NOT a medical purpose machine..small in size and uses a magnetic field as minute as the terristrial magnestim.. and it is an outstanding brain wave learning device for deep sleep, studying, concentration, and meditation.Super brain is an outstanding portable brain wave learning device.Super brain is an outstanding portable brain wave learning device. Because it directly stimulates the brain wave by covering the magnetic field with frequency and releasing certain frequency, it has an exceptional performance compare to other previous brain wave learning devices that use sound and light.    Recently, as a depressive disorder therapy using frequency-carrying magnetic field came up, it is being used for many patients who suffer from depression. However, even though they want the magnetic field wave therapy, due to the expensive cost, the patients are hesitant about it.  Depression therapy appliance uses a strong magnetic field to cure. However, our product, since it is NOT a medical appliance, uses single 1.5 voltage battery and has a magnetic field as minute as the terrestrial magnetism. Since our product is not a medical appliance, it cannot create a strong magnetic field like the therapy machine. However, it has an incomparable performance as a brain wave learning device.  With Super brain, instant alpha wave stimulation is possible with single button press. Once the brain wave goes into the alpha wave state, studying, concentration, learning capability, and creativity increase and develop. Since our product is not a medical appliance, it cannot create a strong magnetic field like the therapy machine.

My career background is in areas of Electrical Panel manufacturing, I'm working as a wiring technician in a regular basis. During weekends I spent my time reading books about technology and related topics about green and renewable energy.Like many of us, I'm just an ordinary man who lives my everyday life just like anybody else.Dreaming of big things sometimes, like managing my own Company someday (I'm looking forward to have it fulfilled before I turn 50 years old hopefully). What inspires me to take a stand and make this campaign is the thought of making a difference especially when it will benefit the many.Everyone of us can influence change in our own little ways.Thinking about the natural disasters that always hit the Philippines every year, mark by the recorded strongest typhoon HAIYAN and flooding to most part of the globe. I became increasingly concern about the continuously evolving climate change caused by global warming.I felt like I want to do something but  I'm just a very small dot and what can I do to change things?...but eventually I felt that taking action one step at a time voluntarily on our own, we can influence change.Bringing out our concern about Global warming and make people aware and understand whats happening in the environment presently.I believe we're not too late, if we collect our efforts we can make a bigger change...that's what encourage me to do this campaign.The Campaign is to promote a product that will help lessen the effect of global warming and look for beneficiaries who will use this product.In my campaign I'm are looking forward to build a Portable solar generator to light a two to three classroom village for O.L.S.O.T.S, a volunteer missionary founded school in Cambodia.The high spirit of the Founder who is trying to make a difference on his own gives me even a stronger motivation that I can make a difference as well, if I chose to...and this is my very first charity project...to build and donate a clean and green energy to a village classroom for Cambodia school children.the main OBJECTIVE behind the campaign is to make use of already unearthed solution to the progressing effect of climate change, and that is for us to use the solar energy and any other form clean energy as a source or alternative energy source.
it had been calculated that a degree of increase in earths temperature will eliminate fresh water from one third of the world land surface by 2100 that is only eighty five years from now. time fly so fast... the time is now to take our action...we must not waste every single second of our opportunity to bring back mother nature's health.
I am appealing to every individual around the globe who is reading my campaign please support this cause for mother nature while we still have the chance.
please follow my tweet as well for more updated details, my i.d, @alcantara1971.
HOW CAN DONORS/CONTRIBUTORS HELP THE PROJECT? Donors plays the most important role in this campaign because like any other project we need donors to make our campaign bring forth to reality.I am appealing to every viewers of this campaign to become a donor for this project, myself alone can't do much to fund the project, I can only give what is within my capacity and to physically attend to the progress of the campaign.WHAT BENEFIT DONORS CAN GET FROM THEIR DONATION?In return the campaign is offering some PERKS that you can choose from.Apart from that ...like anybody else I am a donor myself, I cant offer any physical gain but rest assured you will gain intangible returns like healthier environment, cleaner planet to live in...just imagine... if the effect of climate change will continue and nobody care to take a stand... would it be fine for our family's to live in a planet of TYPHOON, HURRICANE, FLOOD , EARTHQUAKE, TSUNAMIS?definitely NO!What I can assure is ...you will gain the feeling of fulfillment and joy because you care as much as I do, you will gain happiness in your heart because you share your love to charity cause, this is what you and me will gain if you donate for this campaign. JOIN AND DONATE FOR CHARITY AND TOGETHER LETS MAKE A STAND TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE, ALONE WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCETOGETHER WE CAN MAKE WONDERS!THE BENEFICIARYI choose to work with O.L.S.O.T.S (Ongoing Learning Studies Outstanding and Talented School). A school founded by Mr.Cyril Pushpanathen. I have known him for more than two years now and he is also my landlord. Cyril spend most of his life in helping the community specially the youth.He used to be a guidance counsellor to Singapore's Prison ministry during his younger days. By the time he retired from service he continued his community service by doing a voluntary mission in Cambodia.He funds most of his charity work from his own pocket together with the help of friends. This man's magnanimous spirit gives me the motivation to make a stand and do something that will make a difference in the community and accomplish something good that will benefit others.and that's why I created this campaign.If a single person can make a good cause to his community, two or more people can accomplish excellent change toward the benefit of many, I can say it is a very simple idea but putting it to life is the hard part.with you my dear viewers out there, I believe that we can achieved our goal with you supporting my campaign. I aim to start small now... lets observed the outcome then we will look forward to a bigger accomplishment in the future.please DONATE FROM THE HEART and join me in my campaign.WHAT IS OUR ACCOMPLISHMENT IF WE SUCCESSFULLY ACCOMPLISH OUR CAMPAIGNMost of us may not be aware that most of the natural disaster and calamities that is happening around the globe is a product of climate change due to Global warming.Global warming cause by extensive use of burning fossil like the crude oil that mostly fueled our car and generators. Fossil fuels run our factories everyday, an energy source that is most use in all parts of the globe.burning this fuels creates an extensive amount of carbon dioxide that blankets the atmosphere and traps the heat that needs to be return to the atmosphere.Heat that wasn't emitted back creates a green house effect bouncing it back to the earth causing imbalance to nature, like melting the glaciers in the arctic, causing oceans to rise, as a result of extensive flooding , typhoon and hurricane to most part of the Globe.THE IMPACT OF OUR CAMPAIGNBy using green energy like the used of solar panels we are minimizing the burning of this fossil fuels and though we can not eliminate right away the global warming effect, we can slow down its progress until such time nature heals herself.That is the main idea of the campaign... saving the globe from climate change.On the other hand we will help our chosen beneficiary charity to have a better and brighter environment by letting them use our green energy,in our case by giving solar generator, in such case we have accomplish two areas of our objective by doing just one campaign.First, we are helping to save the planet from global warming by minimizing the emission of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, Second we have help children of charity. I believe that is a great accomplishment for every kind of campaign.THE PROJECT - PORTABLE SOLAR GENERATOR FOR O.L.S.O.T.S The project is to built a customized wheeled portable solar generator made from available resources from a D.I.Y shop.The concept is to make it handy that it be can easily push or pulled, making it mobile and flexible to be brought to any areas of the school campus. APPROXIMATE PROJECT COST - $1500.00MATERIALS: Solar Panel with connectorDC TO AC INVERTERCharge controller500 watts 8Ah BatteryFuseWooden boardwheelsScrews and Nutslight bulbs with extension wiresMISCELLANEOUS:TransportationShipment costLabor costOthersRISK AND CHALLENGESGenerating the fund is the most difficult challenge of all.Getting donors to support the cause is not easy at all, and I know I will be facing all this during the campaign.But my faith  in all the people and viewers who are reading my story is bigger than any challenges that the campaign may be facing.I believe that all of us yearns to save our environment from being destroyed and this is the biggest hope that I had.I will make every possible way using videos to keep donors updated with the campaign.With this being said, Im looking forward to the funders support.Thank you very much.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","A-4RM is a product development & prototyping company based in The Bay Area. We are committed to creating and producing quality well crafted products using SUSTAINABLE, RECLAIMED, RECYCLABLE, and LOCAL materials in the US. We have over 20 years of experience.
We also help startups,  entrepreneurs, and established companies with CAD modeling, Industrial Design, Renderings, Structural Packaging Engineering, High Fidelity Prototyping, Graphic Illustrations, and UX/UI. 
The Design:The A-4RM (#001) Clock is made of 100% local San Francisco Bay Area redwood cutoffs purchased at a local mill that would otherwise go to waste in a landfill. Other wood species are available (via email for special orders) and they all have a unique pattern which makes each one-of-a-kind. The geometric hexagonal symmetrical facets are sculpted in 3D CAD, CNC machined, and processed by hand. 
Size: The dimensions are 7.25"" x 7."" x 1.5"" and delivered with a silent clock mechanism. The clock mechanism is included with a ⅞ shaft for the hands.
NEW PERK!
Get a Free A-4RM solid redwood business card/Pen/cellphone holder to match your clock when you are among the first 15 buyers.

Wood species: Custom requests can be made with Elm, Redwood, Cypress, Maple, Sycamore, Poplar, and Walnut. Lead time depends on availability. Please send inquiries to: a4rmstudio@gmail.com to receive a quote. 
Environmentally friendly: When you use reclaimed lumber, you decrease the demand for newly sourced lumber, which helps curb deforestation. If harvested responsibly, reclaimed wood is a renewable resource that reduces landfill waste as well as the use of environmental hazards to manufacture new products.
All funds will be used to grow the business facility, purchase machines for more local production and stock reclaimed wood. 
Help us continue to make useful well crafted sustainable products using local materials made in-house as a way to decrease transportation emissions and cost. We promote good design and US production!

</div></div>","A powerful, affordable, easy to use water filter that is perfect for every home. 
Aquatella is a 4-stage countertop water filter that eliminates over 99% of all harmful pathogens, heavy metals, pesticides, and chemicals from your drinking water.






Tap water is treated with a large number of chemicals to kill bacteria and other microorganisms. Plus, even if the source of the water is pure, that water must travel through pipes (sometimes very old pipes) to finally reach your home. These chemicals are routinely added to our water:
 Aquatella will filter out all those things and purify your water! Keep your water clean and your body healthy!



Who’s ready for delicious, clean water? Aquatella comes equipped with the latest nanofiltration filters. It works even with low water pressure and boasts the highest removal rate in its class.


Using a micro high-quality sediment filter, this stage removes small particles including dust, dirt, rust, grit, and particles that are 15 times smaller than a grain of sand. 


Removes Pesticides, Formaldehyde, Chlorine, Heavy Metals, and Odors.


The nano-membrane filter is a unique system possessing removal capabilities well beyond the scope of conventional filtration technologies. This stage is capable of removing a wide range of waterborne contaminants including bacteria, macro-molecules, colloids, and micro-sediment. 


Enhances the fresh taste of water, providing a natural taste by removing dissolved gases and odors through a high quality granular activated bituminous filter. Also removes residual chlorine, pesticides, heavy metals, organic pollutants, and odors.



The process of removing fluoride also lightly alkalizes your water (a natural side effect of the fluoride removal process). Enjoy fluoride-free, alkaline water with the Optional Fluoride Filter!
Oh and guess what…as a thank you for being a Kickstarter backer, we’re including the Fluoride Filter (Compare at $60 with other filters) for FREE!
The Fluoride Filter is an upgrade of the Activated Carbon filter (replaces it) and removes everything the Carbon Filter filters just as well along with fluoride.

When we say these filters last, they REALLY Last. Aquatella was built to handle the nastiest tap water.

That’s 200x more than a single Brita filter! To put that in perspective, if you drank half a gallon of water a day - you wouldn’t need to replace your filter for almost 44 years!

We still recommend changing the filter every year to keep the flow rate high, but in a doomsday scenario, one Aquatella will provide you fresh water for a long time. The secret is in the quality of the filters and the out valve. By dumping the contaminants, the filter is able to stay cleaner longer and prevent clogging. 

Since you’ll be changing filters much less often, you’ll be significantly reducing waste from discarded filter cartridges!




 Aquatella is extremely easy to install when used as a counter-top filter. Attach it to almost any counter-top faucet without hassle!

They have three basic tasks to complete: dry our bodies, dry themselves  and look good while doing it.  Why Moso Towel? So, given their simple purpose, why is it so hard to find one towel that combines softness and absorbency, hygiene and style?We often think little of what towel to choose and why. Moso is a towel with presence. Designed to look, feel, perform and last better and longer Features 
50% More absorbent than 100% cotton and at the same time ultralight and thick (because bamboo fiber is lighter and more absorbent than any other fiber).
Luscious softness and silky texture.
Highly breathable.
Dries faster - Anti odour.
Naturally antibacterial.
Naturally hypoallergenic and free of chemicals.
Thermoregulating.
Strong and durable.
Wrinkle resistant.
Colorfast.
Simple, elegant and minimalist design.
600+ GSM (in comparison with cotton, a 600 GSM bamboo towel is equivalent to a 800 GSM cotton towel).
30% larger than the standard bath sheet.
Certified by Oeko-Tex®.
1 - Year warranty.
Fully biodegradable.
   The Bamboo Factor We use a towel multiple times a day. After a shower or a soak in the tub, after we wash our hands, at the beach or the pool.However, when shopping for a good towel, the abundance and differences in quality and price can be confusing and overwhelming.Budget towels get scratchy after a couple of washes, take forever to dry and are germ factories. You have to spend quite a lot to make sure that your towel really will be worth its price tag. But we don’t think it has to be so.  In our search for materials we came across the bamboo fiber and thought it was amazing how beneficial its properties were. Working with it was a revelation as we found all the qualities we were looking for. It’s naturally antibacterial, lightweight and fast drying, and is one of the most sustainable raw materials on earth.  In a recent test, a culture of bacteria was placed on bamboo yarn and cotton yarn. Within 24 hours, 99.8% of the bacteria in the bamboo yarn had died, while the bacteria number increased in the cotton yarn.  Towels That Will Last   Comparative studies of properties of bamboo viscose versus cotton fiber in polyester blended knitted fabrics, demonstrate a higher tensile and bursting strength achieved by bamboo fibers. Because of these qualities, Moso Towel doesn't lose its shape and it doesn't shrink.     Ultra Absorbent  By weight, bamboo towels absorb 50% more water than cotton ones do in almost half the time.  Bamboo fiber has microscopic holes and gaps, making it more absorbent than any other fiber, which means our towel is highly breathable and also dries quickly. 600 GSM means a lot more absorption capacity in a bamboo towel. In comparison with cotton, a 600 GSM bamboo towel is equivalent to a 800 GSM cotton towel.  Less Dye & Vibrant Colors Bamboo fabric takes organic and natural dyes more rapidly and thoroughly. It doesn’t need to be mercerized to improve luster.     Design Moso Towel has a modern minimalist design that blends easily with your bathroom decor.   The Moso Towel is 100% bamboo yarn weaved through a 100% premium organic cotton sheet: 75% high quality bamboo double terry over 25% twisted yarn organic cotton sheet.   Color Chart We chose a diverse color palette, including both bright and neutral shades.   Sizes Available   We Are Backed by Science Here are links to websites with articles about recent research that support many of the qualities that we enjoy in bamboo fabrics:    As customers, we can make a difference by trusting ecologically aware producers and manufacturers and choosing organic products.  Who’s Talking About This?    Certifications We are committed to only work following regulations under the OEKO-TEX 100 standard at every stage of the process.      Risks & Challenges Our supply chain is ready to go and we've had production samples made.

<h1>Did you know?</h1>
<p>Americans spend 90% of their time indoors breathing stale air. We strive to make our homes energy efficient, but in doing so trap all of the toxins inside with no way for them to escape. Compounding this problem, studies have found that indoor pollutants can be more harmful to our bodies than outdoor pollutants, with some health effects not noticeable until years later.</p>
<h1>That's where brēth comes in.</h1>

<h1>How does brēth help?</h1>
<p>The technology is pretty straight forward. brēth actively feeds the plants all of the toxins and carbon dioxide in the air around it. The plants then use this as fertilizer to grow stronger. These health-giving plants only need light from the lamp above, and water to create filtered, fresh, and clean air.</p>

<p>We’re especially excited about this product because it also gives parents the chance to provide clean air to their young children. Babies breathe about 40 times per minute, which is 2x as much as an adult, and brēth is helping us give these little ones the purest air for their healthy development.</p>
<h1>What's the science behind brēth?</h1>
<div data-href=""https://youtu.be/zVTOahDCth4?rel=0""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""344"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/zVTOahDCth4?feature=oembed&amp;wmode=transparent"" width=""612""></iframe></div></div>
<p>First, we developed the patented technology behind brēth in 2013 in the form of giant indoor green walls that force air toxins in a building through the plants to clean the air. In 2016, our green wall system successfully passed air purification tests run by Staffordshire University in England.</p>
<div data-id=""22400134""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/022/400/134/c2da13b275e19ecccbcb15e3a5c5ec1a_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1535673823&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=bdd896b2ab1a107bfdde9fa153b7def8"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>Then, in 2017, we had the idea to develop a table-top version of our green wall. The idea of the smaller unit is to bring the same air purification of a green wall to your personal space. <strong>Thus, brēth was born.</strong></p>
<div data-id=""22400193""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/022/400/193/cc0cde7dde93334f8d425af4f67dc7f9_original.png?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1535674382&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;lossless=true&amp;s=563a304a49ea144f4162acf74a311b7a"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>In August, we contracted a 3rd party research team, Ambient Group Inc., to run official air purification tests on the brēth prototype. After running the initial test, the research team insisted that the results must be wrong - but brēth produced the same amazing results again and again. Even we were astounded at the breakthrough!</p>
<div data-id=""22400297""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/022/400/297/d16f42560c82553390b478d347615126_original.jpg?ixlib=rb-1.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1535675257&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=e9e28bc80561d5a265750e2bbb0b94aa"" src=""""/></figure></div>

<p><em>This graph illustrates the culmination of testing experiments where formaldehyde was introduced directly into the air intake of the brēth™ Unit. The gas, at the dosing point, was allowed to reach a steady state concentration (blue). Note that the proportional concentrations of formaldehyde within chamber (green) and the outlet from the chamber (red) do not increase appreciably during the dosing experiment. This equates to an approximate seventy percent formaldehyde removal rate from the airstream. </em></p>

<p>With brēth’s technology, air is purified naturally using photosynthesis and bacteria cleaning processes in plants. The brēth unit uses a fan to capture indoor airflow and deliver it back to the plants, who convert toxins into organic compounds that they can use as food. The sugars plants produce in photosynthesis assist in this process by breaking down harmful bacteria into useful compounds. Using this active process versus the passive photosynthesis plants usually undergo, brēth has the bacteria-cleaning power of approximately 200 houseplants.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>No one wants to see a good idea executed poorly, especially the inventors. We have worked extremely hard to ready this product for Kickstarter as well as for full-scale manufacturing and fulfillment. But here are what we see as the risks and challenges:<br/><br/>MANUFACTURING: The great news is that we’re already ahead of the game. The mold for brēth is created. We are now producing and testing brēth units to ensure that they are ready for our backers. However, unforeseen revisions to the mold can happen. We want to ensure that our supporters are receiving a product that will last and that they will love. To minimize the possibility of unforeseen revisions, we’ve already begun manufacturing testing before our kickstarter launch. This gives us additional time in case of unforeseen delays. We are also working with experienced and professional manufacturing partners who have a track record for efficiency and quality.<br/><br/>We are also in the process of finalizing the brēth app. After kickstarter, we’ll be making final touches on the app development as well as fine-tuning the app’s performance to ensure the best customer experience and the best accuracy of the sensor data. Then the app needs to be approved by Android and Apple, which can take time. In order to minimize any delays concerning the app, we have involved experienced app development partners that know this process forwards and backwards.<br/><br/>PRODUCT ADJUSTMENTS: As brēth gears up for production, there will likely be some minor adjustments to improve the final product. We have already made a pre-production prototype to test and refine brēth and allow us to incorporate our adjustments. This will always be beneficial for you, the consumer, and we will keep you up to speed if any changes are made and why.<br/><br/>FULFILLMENT: Even with greatest foresight and planning, unexpected circumstances can arise: a supplier misses a deadline, a machine breaks down, or a shipment gets lost. Those things could cause a delay. To minimize the possibility of manufacturing setbacks, we have already begun the process and partnered with a reliable and efficient manufacturer, and just in case, we will have at least one back-up supplier for each component pre-located. We also have product commercialization experts who will help ensure smooth sailing from our suppliers and factories.<br/><br/>Regarding plant shipping, especially international shipping, please take into consideration that there are shipping restrictions on soil and plants from the U.S. to certain countries. To handle this challenge effectively, we will be working with plant suppliers in those specific areas of the world that don’t allow U.S. plant and soil exports.<br/><br/>Also, based on country and availability, actual plant types may vary. We assure you that if plant substitutes are needed, we will personally reach out to each of our customers to notify them of the acceptable plant substitution(s). We will always choose the best plant substitutions that adhere to brēth’s air purification standards, so that you still have the best product we can provide.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION:<br/>In the event that things don't go as planned, whether it's a delay in the manufacturing timeline, shipping date, or something else, we promise to communicate honestly with you and work around the clock until we correct the issue.<br/><br/>THANK YOU:<br/>Any pledge amount brings us one step closer to our goal. Help brēth make a difference in air quality and plant care enjoyment by clicking the ‘Back This Project’ button at the top of the page, or by helping us spread the word by sharing our page.<br/><br/>We thank you for your support on our mission to help others grow simply, live healthy &amp; breathe easy!</p>

Did you know?
Americans spend 90% of their time indoors breathing stale air. We strive to make our homes energy efficient, but in doing so trap all of the toxins inside with no way for them to escape. Compounding this problem, studies have found that indoor pollutants can be more harmful to our bodies than outdoor pollutants, with some health effects not noticeable until years later.
That's where brēth comes in.


 
How does brēth help?
The technology is pretty straight forward. brēth actively feeds the plants all of the toxins and carbon dioxide in the air around it. The plants then use this as fertilizer to grow stronger. These health-giving plants only need light from the lamp above, and water to create filtered, fresh, and clean air.


Turbo-charges real plants for 100% natural purification (non-natural air purifiers and ionizers can actually be more harmful to your airflow )
Purifies the air in a 10×10 ft room more than 4x per day
Removes upwards of 70% of air toxins with a single pass through the unit
Is engineered with a perfect and sleek design - all your friends will wish they had one
Tells you via app when to water or not, never needs fertilizing - perfect for those who don't have a green thumb!
Grow light automatically turns on/off every 12 hours or with a custom timer
Water reservoir lasts for 10 days and the sensor tells you exactly when to add more water


Simply download the brēth app to monitor how much air is being purified at any given time. brēth measures the plant’s water level and alerts you when you need to add more. The unit's sensors make sure the water levels are always at an optimal level to keep you from over-watering or under-watering your plants. Zero plant care skills needed.


 


We’re especially excited about this product because it also gives parents the chance to provide clean air to their young children. Babies breathe about 40 times per minute, which is 2x as much as an adult, and brēth is helping us give these little ones the purest air for their healthy development.
What's the science behind brēth?

First, we developed the patented technology behind brēth in 2013 in the form of giant indoor green walls that force air toxins in a building through the plants to clean the air. In 2016, our green wall system successfully passed air purification tests run by Staffordshire University in England.

Then, in 2017, we had the idea to develop a table-top version of our green wall. The idea of the smaller unit is to bring the same air purification of a green wall to your personal space. Thus, brēth was born.

In August, we contracted a 3rd party research team, Ambient Group Inc., to run official air purification tests on the brēth prototype. After running the initial test, the research team insisted that the results must be wrong - but brēth produced the same amazing results again and again. Even we were astounded at the breakthrough!

Here's a chart of the test results from the official study that shows brēth removes upwards of 70% of air toxins with just 1 pass through the unit! You can view the full study release here.

This graph illustrates the culmination of testing experiments where formaldehyde was introduced directly into the air intake of the brēth™ Unit. The gas, at the dosing point, was allowed to reach a steady state concentration (blue). Note that the proportional concentrations of formaldehyde within chamber (green) and the outlet from the chamber (red) do not increase appreciably during the dosing experiment. This equates to an approximate seventy percent formaldehyde removal rate from the airstream. 

With brēth’s technology, air is purified naturally using photosynthesis and bacteria cleaning processes in plants. The brēth unit uses a fan to capture indoor airflow and deliver it back to the plants, who convert toxins into organic compounds that they can use as food. The sugars plants produce in photosynthesis assist in this process by breaking down harmful bacteria into useful compounds. Using this active process versus the passive photosynthesis plants usually undergo, brēth has the bacteria-cleaning power of approximately 200 houseplants.
This is awesome! Now what?

<p>Remocam is the world’s first <b>IoT security camera</b> that you can place at home or in the office. This easy-to-setup, high quality IP camera delivers crystal clear surveillance straight to your smartphone so you can see what’s happening at your home or office anytime, anywhere.  Talk to your pets or check in on the babysitters who are taking care of your baby.  </p>
<p>Remocam is also the first security camera that has ever integrated IoT technology. While you are away from home, you can still feed your pet on time with a remote-controlled pet feeder. Just watched your baby fall asleep on your Remocam app? Turn on his favorite lullabies as your baby sleeps. </p>
<p>We design, program, manufacture and assemble Remocam all in-house.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>

<span><p></p>
<p>Well, you can look it up on Wikipedia, but it's too hard to understand. <br/>Here's our version of IoT:</p>
</span>
</div>
<p>Internet of Things (IoT) is a network environment, in which different<br/>electronic devices can exchange data and interact with each other.</p>
<p>How does Remocam use this? With IoT technology, Remocam is able<br/>to operate any electronic device that comes with a remote-control.</p>
<p>Now you can, not only monitor the house while you are away, but also <br/>control different electronic devices remotely.</p>

The app will suggest popular drinks based on the customer's selections, while also introducing many options that the customer has probably never heard of. The user can also rate drinks and save their favorites. Manufacturers and suppliers are able to utilize this app by getting rebates to consumers and show new products coming soon, while also telling manufactures or suppliers how many times their products are scanned. This app is able to be shared on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter or by email so people can send their friends drinks to try or great party drink ideas. More great features and benefits will come from user feedback and suggestions through updates. Our goal is to have a completely functional, easy to use, and very user friendly tool.
We have been creating and documenting this concept for quite some time. The app has unique features not presently available in the marketplace. 
The only real challenges we currently face involve the programming and coding that's required to build such a complex database with so many unique features. Once that's successfully completed, the initial product launch will take place and consumer feedback will determine what added features will come via product updates.
Setbacks are virtually inevitable, and the only real way to handle them is to be immediately reactive and to make it a priority to make things roll as smoothly as possible. This is our primary starting venture of this kind, so it has our complete and individual attention.

FEATURES AND BENEFITS of App! 
1). Try new recipes with old and new products 
2). Get more familiar with many types of products
3). Save money at liquor stores from instant rebates on products
4). Never pay full retail for select products at liquor stores 
5). Build a profile and share any party pics or events 
6). Let suppliers send you cool merchandise for buying or scanning their products
7). Be able to scan and build drinks at resturaunts and bars 8). More features and benefits to come on updates!9). Get updates and early promotions on new products coming soon Please look at the gallery of pics to see the App and some different brands and flavors that are out there.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Who we are:</strong></p>
<p>We are Beau Burns and Matt Bielski, two Californians with an
idea on how to solve our water shortage needs. 
Not just here in the western United States, but across the globe.  </p>
<p><strong>What we’re doing:</strong></p>
<p>We are using 100% solar energy to create clean water AND
electricity.  We can create clean water
from salt water, grey water, even waste water. 
The solution goes from the reservoir into the pressure tank.  Here it is then heated to boiling using concentrated solar
energy and pressurized.  The pressurized
steam then turns a turbine which creates electricity.  The steam is then condensed into clean,
fresh, pure drinkable water.</p>
<p>The only input our system needs is salty or dirty water and sunlight.</p>
<p><strong>Why it’s better:</strong></p>
<p>According to the U.N., by 2025 20% of the world will need to
rely on desalinated water for their fresh water needs.  Current desalination methods require A LOT of
energy.  Even in reverse osmosis systems,
up to half of the cost of the water coming out is electricity costs.  That’s a lot coal and oil going to be needed
to burn!  </p>
<p>The Re<sub>2</sub>O
system uses ONLY solar power.  And it
even creates clean electricity in the process!</p>
<p>Also, a lot of people don’t realize that the salt left over
is actually up to a 22% brine solution. 
Actual seawater is around 3% salt. 
And it’s often just dumped back into the environment.  That’s not good for the plants and animals in
the area of desal plants.  </p>
<p>The Re<sub>2</sub>O system
can cook off ALL of the water in the pressure tank, leaving only salt, which
can then be removed and used instead of poisoning the surrounding area.</p>
<p>So to sum up, our Re<sub>2</sub>O system
creates drinkable water from nearly any source using only solar energy, clean
renewable electricity, and salt that our friends in the northeast can use
during the winter.</p>
<p><strong>What we need:</strong></p>
<p>We need $500,000 to finish research and development for
our production model.<span>  We have the proof
of concept done, as you can see.  Now we
need to hire a few engineers and maybe a physicist or two, rent some factory space, and buy a lot of different
materials.  We have the plans and calculations
for a few different, much bigger and efficient versions.  But we need money to get those designs off
the page and into a working model.  So
please, donate if you can, or just share this with as many people as
possible.  California, the western United
Sates, at least a fifth of the people on our planet need cheap, reliable,
eco-friendly drinking water.</span></p>

</div><h1><b>What Our Campaign Is For</b></h1>
<p>My
whole life I've loved Star Wars. I think I had every Star Wars toy made as a
kid. And sadly got rid of them a long time ago. 
I was searching online for Star Wars figures one night and discovered a
customized figure.  I looked at my fiancée
and said “I could do that” she agreed so I decided to learn how to make my own
figures and vehicles. As I began to customize, I started to need waterslide
decals, but couldn't really find any online. Everyone said make your own, and I
did. It was kind of a disaster! I wound up wasting so much money and so many
materials trying to get it right, that I wished I could have just bought some. </p>
<p>So
I decided to make a place to buy them. I bought a high quality photo printer,
made up some designs, and perfected waterslide decal making. I started offering
them on eBay and on Facebook and people went wild! That is also how we created
Galactic Plastics.  We've been blessed to
sell a lot of great looking decals, but I have a limitation. A question asked
by many people is ""Can you do white (or silver or gold)?"" I have to
answer ""Sorry, not on clear paper.""</p>
<p>The
problem is that most consumer grade printers, even the highest quality ones,
lack the option of white or metallic ink or toner. They print based on CMYK (cyan,
magenta, yellow and black) color scale and use the media (background/paper) for
white. So far, we have been able to make some really good decals using this
method.  There are printers out there
that can print with white on clear paper, but they are extremely expensive!  So that’s where you guys and gals come in.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1433380/files/20150501133222-DECAL_SHEET_4_IMPERIAL_ASSORTED_3_WATERMARK.jpg?1430512342"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<h2><b>What
We Need &amp; What You Get</b></h2>
<p>I've
found another option. A Japanese company called ALPS used to make a thermal ink
printer that used white ink, but they discontinued it. The printers can be
found in the secondary market and the toner is still readily available. They
can be purchased for a far more reasonable price than a commercial printer. I
am a certified printer repair technician, so I can maintain a used printer
myself. And since it's a thermal ink style printer, I will be able to use the
same decal paper I use now.</p>
<p>Our
goal is to raise $2,000 for the ALPS printer and stock of ink cartridges.  Buying the ink cartridges for this printer
will be about $400 cheaper than buying just one white toner cartridge for a
comparable laser printer. This savings will be for each time the ink needs to
be replaced. This will allow us to keep our prices at their current level with
significant improvement to our product.  I think you can see the benefits!</p>
<p>Our
perks range from our eternal gratitude all the way up to you receiving 5
awesome decal sheets (3 pre-designed and 2 customized just for you). </p>
<p>If
we happen to not make it to our goal, you will still receive a decal sheet
printed with our current technology (without white on a clear background or
metallic colors) and still get a good deal on them! Anything extra will go
toward growing our business and into our “printer fund”.  Did I mention that white on a clear
background and metallic decals are in high demand? </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1433385/files/20150501133252-DECAL_SHEET_12_-_COBRA_DECAL_SHEET_1_WATERMARK.jpg?1430512372"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<h2><b>The
Impact</b></h2>
<p>We will be able to fill a void in a market and help out
many fellow action figure customizers find the decals they have searched high
and low for to complete a restoration or custom project.  Also our customized decal sheets come with an
almost endless possibility of designs. </p>
<p>Ladies it’s your turn now!  With the waterslide decals you can get
customized you can add awesome designs to your home projects including but not
limited to furniture, arts and crafts, and much more!  There is endless possibilities. Also you can
get custom nail art designs.  My fiancée
loves using them!  </p>

<h2><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges</b></h2>
<p>Though
there are risks involved with anything, the risks for this campaign are
actually pretty low. If we don’t reach full funding we will still have decals
to deliver. Our decals are already high quality and we have some pretty damn
cool designs! We just won’t be able to deliver designs with white on a clear
background or metallic colors. </p>
<p>As
with any campaign, one of the biggest challenges is promotion. We need to get
the word out! This is where you can help out, even if you can’t make a monetary
contribution. Please spread the word about our campaign! Share it with your
friends on social media. Tell your friends at work. Call your cousin across the

<li>Every second thousands of plastic water bottle are thrown away or just toss out.</li>
<li>That adds up to millions every day, and exactly 63 BILLION plastic water bottles are thrown away each year.</li>
<li>The fact that we do not see this makes it seem OK.</li>
<li>However, the cold truth is, this crisis is getting out of control.</li>
<li>Not only does it affect marine life and wildlife, it is also affecting our home planet, Earth.</li>
<li>This crisis has grown 10 folds or more over the last decade.</li>
<li>It is a real environmental problem, not only here in the US but worldwide.</li>
<li>Plastic bottles are super cheap to produce, we mean little to nothing!</li>
<li>Water is even cheaper! (Look at your electric bill VS. water bill, it is almost 10X cheaper!)</li>
<li>Big companies are making 10 to 100 times profit on water from us.</li>
</ul><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Sub Xero is the ultimate solution to this worldwide disaster</h2><ul>
<li>5 GL bottles or even glass bottles (glass is much better) will save you so much more than plastic bottles.</li>
<li>It can fit 37 regular 16.9 oz bottles.</li>
<li>That can easily last a week for a family of 4.</li>
<li>It only cost $1.50 to $2 to refill a 5 GL at your nearest grocery store.</li>
<li>A case of 4pk water bottle is $5 to $8. (You can literally save over $500 a year, if that does not convince you then I don't know what does?)</li>
<li>Imagine if 10% of the people in the world stop drinking from plastic bottles (I myself do not), then we can reduce 630 million plastic bottles each year.</li>
<li>10% can make a huge different especially if it is a world wide.</li>
<li>5 GL bottles also produce no waste or plastic.</li>
<li>Plastic bottles can get warm within minutes and if left out in the sun for too long and can actually be carcinogenic. Yikes.</li>
<li>Sub Xero keeps your water cold all day, so there is no need to refill your cup with ice every time you get a drink.</li>
<li>Even if you do not the idea of Sub Xero, at least drink from a reusable water bottle.</li>
</ul><h3>Image all the benefits of an electric water cooler but on a whole new level</h3><p><img alt=""ezgif.com-gif-maker-173793aa3d7db729f.gif"" border=""0"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://gifyu.com/images/ezgif.com-gif-maker-173793aa3d7db729f.gif"" src=""""/></p><h2>  Sub Xero VS. Electric Water Coolers</h2><ul>
<li>Cost 1/10 to 1/20 of the price.</li>
<li>100% Waterproof and Washable.</li>
<li>Superb craftsmanship and quality.</li>
<li>Long lasting, 10 years +/- 5 years, reusable.</li>
<li>Portable, users can take it literally anywhere.</li>
<li>Aesthetically attractive no matter where you put it.</li>
<li>No wires, electric components, metal or plastic pieces.</li>
<li>Flexible, will not tear, break, nor rip no matter how hard you try.</li>
<li>Maintenance , costly fixes, troubleshooting problems does not exist.</li>
<li>Takes up virtually no space at all, it is just a thermal insulating cover.</li>

<li>Millions of people refill 5 GL bottles on a daily/weekly basic. Yet, no one has even though of the idea of Sub Xero. We (Future BuyZ) know for a fact that at least 90% of water drinkers prefer cold water over warm water any day. Especially in the south where the weather is like the surface of out Sun. </li>
<li>We have a small office and drink out of the 5 GL bottles all day. After years of drinking room temperature water (winter was the best season since the water was natural cold), we just got fed up with the taste. </li>
<li>We are located in Florida and Florida wins the hottest state in the USA, beating out all other 49 contestants! Probably the worst award for 1st place and not an award to be happy about. So you get the picture, hot weather and warm water is a double negative, which does not make it a positive, it makes it a quadruple negative.</li>
<li>Millions of people have 5 GL bottles in there home. The ones that can afford an electric water cooler will get one. BUT for the rest of us, we just have to deal with room temperature water. BUT not anymore, Sub Xero is here and its ready to assist your hydration needs!</li>

<li>Back in July, we made 2 colors, white and blue.</li>
<li>The blue was kind of ugly, but the white was attractive.</li>
<li>We changed the color from medium blue to neon and boy did that make  a huge difference.</li>
<li>We decided the logo should go on top next to the opening of the zipper and make it big enough so anyone can see it. Small logos are really meant for electronic devices.</li>
<li>We did not even think about the carrying strap. Thank goodness we made the carrying strap. Imagine how hard it would be carrying Sub Xero with a handle or strap.</li>
<li>This was the bare minimum we had thought of. No retail packaging or bar-codes. Our main focus was just to make a prototype and test it out to see if it even works. If it does not work, then there was no point in making Sub Xero.</li>
</ul><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Testing Sub Xero out (Still in prototype)</h2><ul>
<li>We tested Sub Xero in 3 different control variations.</li>
<li>It was done in the shade but control # 3 (No ice or Sub Xero cover) was left in the shade for 6 hours and then in the sun for 6 hours.</li>
<li>Miami, Florida was perfect for testing grounds since the run rises early and sets late.</li>
<li>The weather was even better because its so hot during the summer and still hot in the winter. (It's literally 85F outside in November as we are typing this!)</li>
<li>We use the 2 prototype of Sub Xero for testing. If this experiment/testing fail, then of course we would have never mass produced Sub Xero.</li>
<li>However, that was not the case. As you can Sub Xero did quite well and we were more than impress. It was then we started producing the logo, carrying straps and the final Sub Xero.</li>

<li>
<i><strong>June 2017</strong></i> - The idea of Sub Xero was actually though of in April 2017 by Future BuyZ. It was not actually 100% thought out and confirm for production until June 2017.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>July 2017</strong></i> - It took less than 1 week to make the prototype which included the zipper. That was all. The bare minimum to see how it looks and perform.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Mid July 2017</strong></i> - Intensive 3 day testing begins.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>August 2017</strong> </i>- The preparation and designing of the retail box, logo, branding, and packaging is all set.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Mid August 2017</strong></i> - The final product of Sub Xero is 100% complete and is ready for sale.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>September 2017</strong></i> - Close friends and family members are given a free Sub Xero for testing.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>November 2017</strong></i> - Indiegogo project is launched! (What happened in October?, We decided to take a 2-3 week break from all the hard work).</li>

<h2><strong>Funding Sub Xero. $10K is the minimum we are asking. Your support is truly appreciated.</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Like most or all projects, the minimum just covers for the cost of the product itself.</li>
<li>Sub Xero was made possible by a team, a company, not just one person.</li>
<li>The cost of production, assembly line, designing, video/photo editing, testing, packaging, shipping, and everything in order to make an idea come to life is very rewarding but at the same time truly difficult.</li>
<li>It takes a big risk to commit to your passion and make it a reality.</li>
<li>Creating something from nothing truly gives one the sense of accomplishment , wisdom, and knowledge.</li>
<li>We have learn so much through this journey about how to make an idea to a reality.</li>
<li>On the other hand. It would be  a great disappoint if our pledgers/backers were not impressed by our invention.</li>
<li>It truly pains us to know that after all the hours, sweat, blood, tears, and hard work we put into Sub Xero as a team, was all for nothing because the audience/consumers was not impress nor care about such product. </li>
<li>If you can not pledge anything, that is fine, your support and sharing is all we need.</li>
<li>We just ask you, your family, friends, and coworkers to share and tell others about Sub Xero. That would be more than enough and invaluable to us.</li>
<li>Anything really helps. Thank you!</li>

Every second thousands of plastic water bottle are thrown away or just toss out.
That adds up to millions every day, and exactly 63 BILLION plastic water bottles are thrown away each year.
The fact that we do not see this makes it seem OK.
However, the cold truth is, this crisis is getting out of control.
Not only does it affect marine life and wildlife, it is also affecting our home planet, Earth.
This crisis has grown 10 folds or more over the last decade.
It is a real environmental problem, not only here in the US but worldwide.
Plastic bottles are super cheap to produce, we mean little to nothing!
Water is even cheaper! (Look at your electric bill VS. water bill, it is almost 10X cheaper!)
Big companies are making 10 to 100 times profit on water from us.
Sub Xero is the ultimate solution to this worldwide disaster
5 GL bottles or even glass bottles (glass is much better) will save you so much more than plastic bottles.
It can fit 37 regular 16.9 oz bottles.
That can easily last a week for a family of 4.
It only cost $1.50 to $2 to refill a 5 GL at your nearest grocery store.
A case of 4pk water bottle is $5 to $8. (You can literally save over $500 a year, if that does not convince you then I don't know what does?)
Imagine if 10% of the people in the world stop drinking from plastic bottles (I myself do not), then we can reduce 630 million plastic bottles each year.
10% can make a huge different especially if it is a world wide.
5 GL bottles also produce no waste or plastic.
Plastic bottles can get warm within minutes and if left out in the sun for too long and can actually be carcinogenic. Yikes.
Sub Xero keeps your water cold all day, so there is no need to refill your cup with ice every time you get a drink.
Even if you do not the idea of Sub Xero, at least drink from a reusable water bottle.
Image all the benefits of an electric water cooler but on a whole new level  Sub Xero VS. Electric Water Coolers
Cost 1/10 to 1/20 of the price.
100% Waterproof and Washable.
Superb craftsmanship and quality.
Long lasting, 10 years +/- 5 years, reusable.
Portable, users can take it literally anywhere.
Aesthetically attractive no matter where you put it.
No wires, electric components, metal or plastic pieces.
Flexible, will not tear, break, nor rip no matter how hard you try.
Maintenance , costly fixes, troubleshooting problems does not exist.
Takes up virtually no space at all, it is just a thermal insulating cover.
The birth from passion to innovationEvery time you walk into a grocery franchise/store, whats the first thing you see (usually)? 5 GL water bottles and the water machine dispenser for it. 
Millions of people refill 5 GL bottles on a daily/weekly basic. Yet, no one has even though of the idea of Sub Xero. We (Future BuyZ) know for a fact that at least 90% of water drinkers prefer cold water over warm water any day. Especially in the south where the weather is like the surface of out Sun. 
We have a small office and drink out of the 5 GL bottles all day. After years of drinking room temperature water (winter was the best season since the water was natural cold), we just got fed up with the taste. 
We are located in Florida and Florida wins the hottest state in the USA, beating out all other 49 contestants! Probably the worst award for 1st place and not an award to be happy about. So you get the picture, hot weather and warm water is a double negative, which does not make it a positive, it makes it a quadruple negative.
Millions of people have 5 GL bottles in there home. The ones that can afford an electric water cooler will get one. BUT for the rest of us, we just have to deal with room temperature water. BUT not anymore, Sub Xero is here and its ready to assist your hydration needs!
Sub Xero in its prime/prototype stage (July 2017)
Back in July, we made 2 colors, white and blue.
The blue was kind of ugly, but the white was attractive.
We changed the color from medium blue to neon and boy did that make  a huge difference.
We decided the logo should go on top next to the opening of the zipper and make it big enough so anyone can see it. Small logos are really meant for electronic devices.
We did not even think about the carrying strap. Thank goodness we made the carrying strap. Imagine how hard it would be carrying Sub Xero with a handle or strap.
This was the bare minimum we had thought of. No retail packaging or bar-codes. Our main focus was just to make a prototype and test it out to see if it even works. If it does not work, then there was no point in making Sub Xero.
Testing Sub Xero out (Still in prototype)
We tested Sub Xero in 3 different control variations.
It was done in the shade but control # 3 (No ice or Sub Xero cover) was left in the shade for 6 hours and then in the sun for 6 hours.
Miami, Florida was perfect for testing grounds since the run rises early and sets late.
The weather was even better because its so hot during the summer and still hot in the winter. (It's literally 85F outside in November as we are typing this!)
We use the 2 prototype of Sub Xero for testing. If this experiment/testing fail, then of course we would have never mass produced Sub Xero.
However, that was not the case. As you can Sub Xero did quite well and we were more than impress. It was then we started producing the logo, carrying straps and the final Sub Xero.
The Real Deal is RealThis is the final product of Sub Xero, 2 Colors for now.In the future, we will improve on Sub Xero & fixing/adding to it as the consumer suggest. 

INNOVATION: The very first and only insulating thermal cooler cover for 5 gallon glass or plastic bottle container.
Get ready for cold, refreshing, hydrating, and delicious H2O.
Warm, nasty, tasteless water is a thing of the past.
It is far superior to foam or plastic koozies/coolie.
   
 THE NEW COOLER: Step aside electric water coolers.
They're costly, take up valuable space, heavy, require yearly maintenance, breaks down easily, last a few years top, and aren't portable.
Sub Xero is the exact opposite.
It can keep the water 15F to 20F degrees lower than its surrounding temperature (or warmer).
It's a one-of-a-kind nonelectric water cooler.
The elastic material is top quality, and well-built. Craftsmanship at its finest.  


ALL IN ONE: Neoprene is almost as effective as any stainless steel insulator at 1/10 of the cost!
Neoprene is a synthetic rubber/fiber that maintains its insulation, the thicker the better.
It's extremely flexible, durable, but most importantly long lasting and does its job effectively.
Exact same fiber that deep sea scuba divers wear. Sub Xero is almost 1/4 inch thick.
(It's so portable, weightless, and compact. One can fit it virtually anywhere.) ULTRA PERFORMANCE: The unique zig-zag stitching on our neoprene insulating coolie gives it added durability. Thus, results in a tighter fit, keeps water cold(er) longer, and traps the cold particles from escaping. 
Want the best and long lasting coldness?
Fill the 5 gallon water bottle 80-90% to the top.
Leave it in the fridge overnight or in the freezer for 5-6 hours. 
Fill with 5-10 pounds of ice before or after you arrive at your destination. 
(Note: Having ice in the 5 gallon water bottle really does help maintain the coldness for a very long time. Neoprene fiber will trap cold air particles as oppose to regular room temperature water. More more ice the better, can last for days!)
                   (Great for watching games, tv, movies, playing video-games without pausing the moment)Sub Xero Was Made For Everyone
Put any 5 gallon bottle on.
Zip it up.
Fill it with water and ice, and that's it!
You never have to take off Sub Xero.
Once you put it on, just leave it on your 5 gallon.
It is simple as that.
100% Water proof, super durable, high quality neoprene fiber, and last up to 10+ years!

Sub Xero is perfect for many events.
After an intense workout, nothing taste better than cold water.
Having friends over drinking while Sub Xero keeps everyone cool and hydrated.
In your office, when you feel sluggish and tire, a glass of cold water will surely wake you up and keep you focus.
No more having to drink warm nasty water when cold, fresh, and hydrating water is right by your side.
And many more including camping, outdoor field practice, at the church, fundraisers, outdoor cooking, BBQs, meeting events, and whatever makes you happy. 
 
Heavy duty carrying strap included for free!
Easily fits and can support any 5 gallon plastic or glass water bottle. (Over 50 pounds)
You will really appreciate these straps because carrying a 45 pound bottle just for a few seconds can be draining and your back with hate you for it!
Carry the trap with one hand and with the other hand hold the neck of the water bottle.
   
Quick and easy to put on. We highly recommend you to put Sub Xero on an empty 5 gallon bottle before refilling it with water.
However, you can put on Sub Xero with a full bottle. Please be careful (Kids should not handle Sub Xero cover) as a 5 gallon bottle can be 45+ pounds.
 (Durable, it can even stand up on its own with no support. All materials are made with the highest standard quality!)  (Enjoy water, the way its meant to be. Cold and refreshing!)    From Pure Imagination to Creation

June 2017 - The idea of Sub Xero was actually though of in April 2017 by Future BuyZ. It was not actually 100% thought out and confirm for production until June 2017.

July 2017 - It took less than 1 week to make the prototype which included the zipper. That was all. The bare minimum to see how it looks and perform.

Mid July 2017 - Intensive 3 day testing begins.

August 2017 - The preparation and designing of the retail box, logo, branding, and packaging is all set.

Mid August 2017 - The final product of Sub Xero is 100% complete and is ready for sale.

September 2017 - Close friends and family members are given a free Sub Xero for testing.

November 2017 - Indiegogo project is launched! (What happened in October?, We decided to take a 2-3 week break from all the hard work).
Why you should drink cold water?Here is a small list of why cold water is beneficial and healthy to your diet and life.
  


Funding Sub Xero. $10K is the minimum we are asking. Your support is truly appreciated.

Like most or all projects, the minimum just covers for the cost of the product itself.
Sub Xero was made possible by a team, a company, not just one person.
The cost of production, assembly line, designing, video/photo editing, testing, packaging, shipping, and everything in order to make an idea come to life is very rewarding but at the same time truly difficult.
It takes a big risk to commit to your passion and make it a reality.
Creating something from nothing truly gives one the sense of accomplishment , wisdom, and knowledge.
We have learn so much through this journey about how to make an idea to a reality.
On the other hand. It would be  a great disappoint if our pledgers/backers were not impressed by our invention.
It truly pains us to know that after all the hours, sweat, blood, tears, and hard work we put into Sub Xero as a team, was all for nothing because the audience/consumers was not impress nor care about such product. 
If you can not pledge anything, that is fine, your support and sharing is all we need.
We just ask you, your family, friends, and coworkers to share and tell others about Sub Xero. That would be more than enough and invaluable to us.
Anything really helps. Thank you!

(Our team in Ningbo, China having dinner after a very long and busy week)

Tyler Cranston, the owner of Future BuyZ and the leader of this project. 
There were more people that contributed to the making of Sub Xero. (Mainly the designers, packaging people, and the shippers)
We did not include them for this project but their work was very valuable. 
It takes more than guts and passion to make an idea come to life.
To make and idea a reality, requires a team, talented minds, determination and dedication.

Risks/Obstacles/Hardships/Challenges

Without risk there is no reward. The same can be said vice versa.
The greater the risk, the greater the reward, and the greater the downfall.
Quality was our #1 priority. We wanted to create a genuine product that could compete with an electric water cooler for a fraction of the cost.
Restless nights, not going out or getting exercise really took a toll on our health. We wanted to complete Sub Xero in time for the Holidays.
We only had a couple people contribute to this project, a small team.
We spend quite a substantial amount of funding(of our own) to make Sub Xero. If we can't raise the funds then our future projects and this one will be in jeopardy. 
It takes many days or years to build something. It only takes a minute to bring it down.
This was our first project/invention. We had to learn how to prepare and market Sub Xero. Everything must be done at the right time, place, and moment in order for a project to succeed. 
Time. Patience is the key to success. If we mess up on one part, we had to fix redo it until it was perfect. It takes many trials and error to make something perfect, or almost perfect.

About us, Who we are.

Thank you for checking us out.

If you like what you have read and seen could you please let your family and friends know.
We have put 1000's of hours and restless nights to make Sub Xero a reality.
It is already here. We are waiting for eager pledgers and enthusiastic people to contribute to our project. Our success depends 100% solely on our backers and consumers.
If Sub Xero does not get the minimum funding, we will only ship out the those who have back us and will liquidate the excessive inventory and continue on with another project.
We are very confident and know Sub Xero will succeed.
That is why we have produce 4400 units. In the summer time, Sub Xero will be a huge hit and so convenient.
Get yours today because the next shipment is not due for another 2 to 3 months. Thank you again for your support and viewing us.",49.0,2,"1 Campaign

A similar-quality Bluetooth device, while having its evident drawbacks, costs several times more than our solution. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441963058/o2a3icqbht0nrtn2in5f.jpg"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""/></p><p>

<p>Together, we committed to create a product that would protect EpiPen Auto-Injectors from hot and cold temperatures. We are driven by the goal of saving lives by enabling people to take their EpiPen Auto-Injectors wherever they go, even if it’s hot or cold outside. </p>
<p>After three years of work, we have patented the invention, successfully tested prototypes, and are on the brink of starting mass production.  <span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>We need your help to collect enough pre-orders to make mass production possible. </b></span></p>

After my son almost died from a severe allergic reaction, I became determined to keep epinephrine with my son wherever he goes. 
I just can't bear the thought of epinephrine not being there to save him when he has another allergic reaction.  The problem is that EpiPen Auto-Injectors need to be stored at about room temperature (""68° to 77° F"" according to the manufacturer*). My son regularly goes outside (e.g., to the park, swimming, hiking, skiing). The outdoors are typically not room temperature. 

How could I follow the doctor's advice to make sure my son always has EpiPen Auto-Injectors and follow the manufacturer's advice to keep his EpiPen Auto-Injectors at about room temperature?
 
I recruited the technical help of my husband, who happens to be a Stanford-educated engineer who has invented other products you might have used before.  (Hint – You can buy some of his inventions in the Apple Store.)  
Together, we committed to create a product that would protect EpiPen Auto-Injectors from hot and cold temperatures. We are driven by the goal of saving lives by enabling people to take their EpiPen Auto-Injectors wherever they go, even if it’s hot or cold outside. 
After three years of work, we have patented the invention, successfully tested prototypes, and are on the brink of starting mass production.  We need your help to collect enough pre-orders to make mass production possible. 
Thanks in advance,
Sandy Wengreen, Inventor & Founder, EpiShell, Inc.

EpiShell is not just an insulated container. 
The heart of EpiShell is the patented EpiHeat System. This system releases heat when it’s cold outside and absorbs heat when it’s hot outside. It doesn’t use any batteries. Instead, it uses advanced EpiCells that “reset” to room temperature when indoors and then release or absorb heat as necessary when outdoors.  
 

Our patents explain the science behind EpiShell:
https://patents.google.com/patent/US9151531B2 
 

But, yes ... It includes a pretty amazing insulated container.



Deluxe Stainless Steel - Provides extreme durability ... Don't worry about accidental drops 

Ultra-Vacuum Insulation - Blocks sweltering summer temperatures and chilly winter temperatures 

Unique Lid - Thermally speaking, lids are typically the Achilles' heel of vacuum flasks, so we focused on making an exceptional lid to protect your EpiPen Auto-Injectors

 

Two versions


Regular EpiShell protects one EpiPen Auto-Injector (and also fits the carrier tube that comes with the EpiPen).  
Double EpiShell protects two EpiPen Auto-Injector​s (and carrier tubes).

<h3>Why we did this </h3>
<p>Most of us live very stressful lives and often find our professional world interfering with our private life. Over the years I have taken steps to try to break the stress cycle; first it was putting together a standing desk to minimize the damage to my body from sitting most of the day, then it was putting time aside every day to prepare meals and be active. All of these changes have a common theme: I was making sure to take time for myself. This isn't always easy as Dave, Vince, Bob, and I often find ourselves working 80+ hour weeks on top of taking care of our families and loved ones. We hope the ZenScape can serve as a reminder to take some much needed time for yourself. </p>
<p><u><strong>Have you ever:</strong></u><br/>Forgotten to eat due to work?<br/>Put off going to the gym because you were finishing a project?<br/>Struggled with chronic colds that you just couldn't shake?<br/>Neglected relationships?<br/>Had trouble breaking through a problem or mental block?</p>
<p>The ZenScape can help break the cycle! </p>
<p>It's a difficult pill to swallow but WE are often the major cause for these problems. We are all guilty of wasting valuable time surfing the internet, playing with our phones, or going in mental circles due to frustration. Taking a few moments to yourself helps you to refocus, take a look at a problem in a different way, or even just de-stress enough to handle difficult challenges. We hope to help everyone find a sense of calm and remind themselves that taking time for YOU is not only important, but can keep you on track to finish your challenges and free up time to spend doing the things you love. </p>

<h2>Stretch Goals:</h2>
<h3>If we reach $25,000 in funding we will launch with the additional modes below </h3>
<p><strong><u>Music Visualizer -</u></strong>Turn your ZenScape into a music equalizer and watch the LEDs come alive to your favorite beats. You have full control over the color and behavior of the EQ, or set it into a random color mode to watch it truly come alive. </p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/202674007?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p><strong><u>Lightning -</u></strong> Randomized streaks of light create a lightning like effect that transitions across the ZenScape. Combined with the sound sensor this mode is a great way to add ambiance to music or a thunderstorm. Select from multiple color palettes ranging from natural white, blue, or even rainbow lightning; use the mobile application to create your own custom color pallet. </p>
<p><strong><u>FireFlies -</u></strong> Watch as random pixels illuminate around the ZenScape to simulate fireflies. This mode is great to use as a night-light slowly lulling you to sleep with the soothing gentle glow of simulated fireflies. The real fireflies will thank you!</p>
<h3>If we reach $45,000 in funding we will finish the mobile app to control your ZenScape:</h3>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>With deep roots in manufacturing and engineering we are ready to kick off production at the conclusion of the campaign. Having built multiple high-tech product lines in the past has equipped us with the skills, network, and tools to get this product built quickly while maintaining a high level of quality. </p>
<ul>
<li>In addition to working out of Tech Shop we already own a CNC router for manufacturing the wooden bodies of each ZenScape. With multiple machines at our disposal we will be able to produce product with minimal service interruptions. We have also received quotes from local woodworking supply shops for high quality sustainably sourced wood at the volume we need to support this campaign. </li>
<li>We will be manufacturing the Acrylic top display plates using Universal Laser brand CNC machinery. These are high quality machines and their reliability means we will have minimal machine down-time. Universal Laser is also located 20 miles to our North meaning any replacement parts or support is a short drive away. </li>
<li>All Components are sourced through a proven supply chain stemming over 10 years in development. PCB's are built and assembled in San Francisco, California or in Tempe, Arizona from proven and trusted suppliers. Plastic is sourced from Houston, Texas where it is manufactured. Machining and Laser cutting will be done in our home town of Chandler, Arizona. </li>
<li>All final assembly and shipping logistics will be performed at EpiHab in Phoenix, Arizona, a non-profit group providing meaningful employment for individuals with Epilepsy or other challenges. We are committed to providing high quality US jobs and supporting individuals with specific challenges or life requirements. </li>

</div></div>","Why we did this 
Most of us live very stressful lives and often find our professional world interfering with our private life. Over the years I have taken steps to try to break the stress cycle; first it was putting together a standing desk to minimize the damage to my body from sitting most of the day, then it was putting time aside every day to prepare meals and be active. All of these changes have a common theme: I was making sure to take time for myself. This isn't always easy as Dave, Vince, Bob, and I often find ourselves working 80+ hour weeks on top of taking care of our families and loved ones. We hope the ZenScape can serve as a reminder to take some much needed time for yourself. 
Have you ever:Forgotten to eat due to work?Put off going to the gym because you were finishing a project?Struggled with chronic colds that you just couldn't shake?Neglected relationships?Had trouble breaking through a problem or mental block?
The ZenScape can help break the cycle! 
It's a difficult pill to swallow but WE are often the major cause for these problems. We are all guilty of wasting valuable time surfing the internet, playing with our phones, or going in mental circles due to frustration. Taking a few moments to yourself helps you to refocus, take a look at a problem in a different way, or even just de-stress enough to handle difficult challenges. We hope to help everyone find a sense of calm and remind themselves that taking time for YOU is not only important, but can keep you on track to finish your challenges and free up time to spend doing the things you love. 

Working on artwork has always been a soothing creative outlet for all of us on the project, combining technical expertise with creative artistic methods helps us to take a few moments to ourselves and beautify our lives in the process. We hope that you will enjoy bringing our art and light into your everyday life so that we can all breathe a little more, stress a lot less, and work together towards a better future. 

What We Need


Referrals! Scroll down to the Referral section to find out more!
We need to purchase material for our first run of this product and to produce tooling / fixtures to machine and assemble the finished product. We already own or have direct access to the manufacturing equipment we need, now it's just a matter of materials.

Vendors - we are looking for anyone interested in selling this product at events or in a retail setting. Vendors will allow us to reach a wider audience and create a greater variety of artwork.

Artists - We will be holding quarterly competitions for new projection plates. Winning artists will be given a cash prize, royalty, and their designs will be available for sale.  

What You Get:

One ZenScape of your choice: Choose the color for your mirror, the engraved pattern (Including custom patterns), and your cord color. 
Bluetooth LE compatible - can connect up to 4 ZenScapes and 1 SmartphoneUpdate your ZenScape firmware through the mobile app, easily add modes and features as they become available, or change settings/Color Palettes to customize your ZenScape. Every ZenScape comes with free lifetime firmware updates so as we come up with new features you can update your ZenScape. 

Internal Lithium Battery - Charged via USB the battery will give you up to 8Hrs of continuous run-time on max settings and up to 7 days in eco mode. 
Multiple Power options - Plug the ZenScape into any USB port or the included wall adapter to charge the batteries. The ZenScape can run off of the wall-adapter indefinitely for a permanent installation. You can use your portal while it's charging. 
On-board Buttons- Change colors, brightness, and modes using the included buttons; Mobile app is not required for use. 




Mounting Hardware - We provide a way for you to wall mount your ZenScape. If you've ever hung a picture or clock on your wall you can handle this!

USB Cord - A durable high quality 10' [3m] USB-Micro cable with high strength nylon braiding included. Available in 3 colors [Black, White, Gold] to match your environment. 

You can choose from 3 different ZenScape sizes [12 Inch, 18 Inch, 24Inch] Shown below:



Modes
Every ZenScape comes with free lifetime firmware updates meaning as we launch new features, add modes, and fix bugs you will always be up-to-date. Right now each ZenScape comes equipped out of the box with 12 modes including 4 different breathing exercises. Example modes can be found in the campaign Gallery!
Stretch Goals:
If we reach $25,000 in funding we will launch with the additional modes below 
Music Visualizer -Turn your ZenScape into a music equalizer and watch the LEDs come alive to your favorite beats. You have full control over the color and behavior of the EQ, or set it into a random color mode to watch it truly come alive. 

Lightning - Randomized streaks of light create a lightning like effect that transitions across the ZenScape. Combined with the sound sensor this mode is a great way to add ambiance to music or a thunderstorm. Select from multiple color palettes ranging from natural white, blue, or even rainbow lightning; use the mobile application to create your own custom color pallet. 
FireFlies - Watch as random pixels illuminate around the ZenScape to simulate fireflies. This mode is great to use as a night-light slowly lulling you to sleep with the soothing gentle glow of simulated fireflies. The real fireflies will thank you!
If we reach $45,000 in funding we will finish the mobile app to control your ZenScape:


Risks & Challenges
With deep roots in manufacturing and engineering we are ready to kick off production at the conclusion of the campaign. Having built multiple high-tech product lines in the past has equipped us with the skills, network, and tools to get this product built quickly while maintaining a high level of quality. 

In addition to working out of Tech Shop we already own a CNC router for manufacturing the wooden bodies of each ZenScape. With multiple machines at our disposal we will be able to produce product with minimal service interruptions. We have also received quotes from local woodworking supply shops for high quality sustainably sourced wood at the volume we need to support this campaign. 
We will be manufacturing the Acrylic top display plates using Universal Laser brand CNC machinery. These are high quality machines and their reliability means we will have minimal machine down-time. Universal Laser is also located 20 miles to our North meaning any replacement parts or support is a short drive away. 
All Components are sourced through a proven supply chain stemming over 10 years in development. PCB's are built and assembled in San Francisco, California or in Tempe, Arizona from proven and trusted suppliers. Plastic is sourced from Houston, Texas where it is manufactured. Machining and Laser cutting will be done in our home town of Chandler, Arizona. 
All final assembly and shipping logistics will be performed at EpiHab in Phoenix, Arizona, a non-profit group providing meaningful employment for individuals with Epilepsy or other challenges. We are committed to providing high quality US jobs and supporting individuals with specific challenges or life requirements.

HOW IT WORKS



 


Your hands stay clean when discarding the entire take-up assembly. Earth-friendly materials biodegrade in most landfills. Replacement rolls and subscriptions can be ordered online once we start shipping.
 


Systems made with factory produced parts have been in use since November 2016. Here is what some of our testers have to say:

""Yvette loves BrilliantPad! Now that she can relieve herself any time, walking now feels more like playtime and less of a chore.""

""Rory used to wake me up in the middle of the night when she had to go outside. Now I can sleep longer, and Rory can go whenever she needs to!""

""When BrilliantPad is soiled, there is no odor – even before being advanced. Dramatic improvement from traditional pads!""
 

""After a month, I finally finished a roll... during that time, there was no smell!"" - Animal Radio (Listen to the 7-minute broadcast here)

Replacement Rolls Available Online

You can get replacement rolls on our website right after the Indiegogo campaign ends.
Replacement rolls start as low as $19.99 and free shipping with subscription.
With 27 pads per roll, that's just about 1 month per roll per dog!

 

BrilliantPad production sample in action:

BrilliantPad also works well with solids:


“BrilliantPad provides a healthy alternative when you can't walk your dog due to unforeseen circumstances such as extreme weather, heavy traffic or illness. BrilliantPad makes homes cleaner and more hygienic for both pet parents and their dogs.”  – Dr. Brett Shorenstein, VMD
“Most dogs can be trained to adopt new behaviors with sufficient time and patience, and the BrilliantPad Training Guide is consistent with the advice and protocols we use in our veterinary clinic.” – Dr. Carlo Siracusa, DVM, PhD, Dip. ACVB, Dip. ECAWBM, Veterinary Behaviorist
""I worked with the BrilliantPad team to develop the Training Guide, which is well thought out and provides tips to help anyone train their dog to use BrilliantPad.""  – Dr. Margaret Gruen, Board-Certified Veterinary Behaviorist
 



80% thinner and use 33% less material without compromising absorption or durability. 


Disposable rods and end-caps are made with EcoPure® to breakdown 80% in less than 12 months* in most landfills.
* Lab testing in process to quantify rate and amount of degradation. Final amount and rate of decomposition TBD.
 

Many thanks extend to dozens of dogs, pet parents, animal behaviorists, veterinarians, and researchers. BrilliantPad could not have been created without you!

 

Don’t worry, we will help you train your dog to use BrilliantPad. Our Training Guide was developed by Animal Behaviorists from four university-based Veterinary clinics and includes easy-to-follow instructions. Training generally takes anywhere from a few days to several weeks.  
Additional resources include:
(1) Transition pads to help acclimate your dog.
(2) Online training center and help desk.
 


 

We invented the ScoopFree self-cleaning litter box and FroliCat family pet toys. We are experts at making pet waste easier to handle and dispose of, and our experienced team is passionate about developing innovative and useful products.

What is making a “contribution""?
By contributing to our campaign you are helping us bring this product to life. We've finished all of the steps to create and test BrilliantPad, and now we just need to know how many to order for next batch!


Who created it?
The inventors of the ScoopFree automatic, self-cleaning litter box and FroliCat family of pet toys created BrilliantPad.


Why should we use it?
BrilliantPad lets you spend less time cleaning and more time loving. It's easier, cleaner and more sanitary than traditional pads.


What are the main benefits?
BrilliantPad provides freedom and flexibility, promotes health and hygiene, and is better for the environment than traditional pads.


Is BrilliantPad right for me and my dog?
With your commitment and our guidance, you can enjoy the benefits of BrilliantPad. BrilliantPad works best if your dog is under 35 pounds, comfortable around noises made by household appliances, and generally accepting of new items in your home. By pre-ordering, you are letting us know that you're willing and able to invest some time and effort to train your dog to use BrilliantPad.


How much does it cost? 
BrilliantPad will retail at $199.99. Buy on IGG for up to 50% off. Replacement rolls (equal to 27 pads) work out to less than $1 per pad.


What do we get when we order?
One (1) BrilliantPad at the lowest price it will ever be, one (1) replacement roll, and training materials to help teach your dog to use BrilliantPad.


When will I receive my order?
The first 5,000 backers will receive their BrilliantPad systems in August.


Where can I buy replacement rolls?
You can get replacement rolls on our website right after the Indiegogo campaign ends.


How much are replacement rolls?
Replacement rolls start as low as $19.99 and includes free shipping with a subscription. With 27 pads per roll, that's just about a dollar per pad!


Where did the idea for BrilliantPad come from?
One of our co-founders had two dogs and often came home to soiled, shredded pads. He figured there could be a better way.


How did the team come together?
Brett went to Vet School at the University of Pennsylvania. Alan graduated from the M&T program. Brett found Alan through the alumni network.


How did you create the machine?
After coming up with initial plans, we continued to iterate, test and refine our design to ensure it worked with most small dogs.


Does BrilliantPad really work?
20 dogs participated in the development of Brilliant Pad. Tester and animal behaviorists confirm it works reliably and promotes dog health.


 



How does BrilliantPad work?
A super absorbant polymer soaks up urine and begins to dry out solids after a dog goes potty on the pad.


Then what happens?
BrilliantPad's system automatically wraps and seals waste to eliminate odors, and replaces the soiled pad with a fresh one.


Where does the waste go?
Soiled pads are wrapped and sealed at one end of the machine to lock away odor.


Umm, what about poop?
All taken care of! Solid waste fits through an opening in the locked waste cover and is wrapped and sealed.


Hold on. Doesn't that smell?
No! We know this is hard to believe, but testers report that odor is effectively sealed and the system does not smell. Phew!


Will it replace it as soon as they step off?
The system has an adjustable timer. You can set the pad to advance automatically 1, 2 or 3 times a day or manually, at the touch of a button


How often do I have to empty the waste?
Leave it alone for days or weeks at a time. Each roll is like 27 pads. When the supply roll is empty discard the entire take-up assembly.


What is disposal like?
Fast, easy and clean. The plastic backing provides a clean grasp surface for your hands, and the end caps prevent leaks and odors.


What is the environmental impact?
Our pads use one-third less material than traditional pads, and the disposable rods and caps biodegrade in most landfills.


 



What colors do you offer?
The BrilliantPad system is slate grey. Pads are white with a blue/green backing.


What sizes do you offer?
System comes in one size for dogs up to 35 pounds. 24"" x 23"" pad area is comparable to regular pads. System footprint is 34"" x 24"".


Will it fit in my home?
BrilliantPad's compact, attractive design fits comfortably in most homes, even in small spaces.


How big are rolls?
Each roll is equivalent to twenty-seven (27) large 24"" x 23"" pads. Pad roll is 22"" wide and 3.5"" diameter, about the same as a hockey puck!


How many rolls come with the pre-order?
Each pre-order comes with 1 pad roll. After the campaign, you can purchase an auto-delivery subscription or buy rolls in 2, 4 and 9-packs.


 



How many layers are in each pad?
Each pad has five layers that combine to provide durability, absorption, and cleanliness. The top layer is a non-woven fabric that provides superior scratch and tear resistance. The middle three layers quickly absorb liquids. The bottom layer is a barrier lining to prevent leaks and provide a clean grasp surface.


What is the absorbent technology?
BrilliantPad pad rolls are 80% thinner and use 33% less material than traditional pads without compromising absorption or durability. A super-absorbent polymer soaks up liquids, begins to dry out solids and absorbs 50x its weight in liquid.


What is under each pad?
A plastic lining is under the pad. It protects against leaks, seals in odor and provides a clean surface to touch during disposal.


What are the black marks for?
Marks under the pad roll tell the machine how much paper to advance, when the system is out of paper, or if there is a tracking error.


Are the pads strong?
Our pads are 80% thinner and use 33% less material than traditional pads without compromising absorption or durability.


How is BrilliantPad better for the environment?
Our pads use one-third less material than traditional pads, and the disposable rods and caps biodegrade in most landfills.


When does the motor turn on?
The system has an adjustable timer. You can set the pad to advance automatically 1, 2 or 3 times a day or anytime, at the touch of a button.


What if my dog is on the platform when the timer activates?
BrilliantPad has an animal sensor, which prevents the motor from automatically turning on if a dog is on the machine.


Is the system safe?
BrilliantPad is designed for safety starting with a safe, low-voltage UL-approved power supply. Sensors ensure the automatic timer will not start the motor when an animal is present. The waste roll and take-up assembly is covered, and a current limiter will turn off the motor if a paw or hand gets caught in the mechanism.


Are there any other sensors?
A pad sensor reads marks on the rolls for 3 functions: advancing a full pad, detecting finished rolls, and monitoring pad tracking issues.


Does the system need an electrical outlet?
Yes, BrilliantPad requires an electric outlet, and the safe, low-voltage power supply is UL-rated.


Will there be updates to it in the future?
The system has a modular design. Users will be able to obtain new features by purchasing upgraded control modules in the future.


What are the dimensions?
Machine footprint is 34"" x 24"" with pad area of 24"" x 23"". Step-up height for dogs is approximately 2"".


How much does the machine weigh?
BrilliantPad system weighs less than 10 pounds. Replacement rolls are approximately 2 pounds.


Where is it manufactured?
BrilliantPad is designed in Chicago. Replacement pad rolls are made in the USA. The machine is made in China.


Is it patented?
BrilliantPad has multiple patents pending. We vigorously enforce intellectual property rights.


 



Will my dog fit on the machine?
Most dogs under 35 pounds should be able to use BrilliantPad successfully.


What dogs can use BrilliantPad?
BrilliantPad works best with dogs who already use potty pads, or when training puppies less than 3 months old.


What if my dog does NOT already use pads?
Most dogs can be trained to use BrilliantPad. Training requires a consistent investment of time, patience, lots of affection and treats! 


How do I transition my dog from using regular pads to BrilliantPad?
A Training Kit with transition pads, easy-to-follow instructions, and online resources is included to help most dogs adapt to using BrilliantPad.


Can you help me with the training?
You bet. Transition pads, easy-to-follow instructions, and online resources are included to help most dogs adapt to using BrilliantPad.


Can I use any pad with BrilliantPad?
Place your current pad on top of BrilliantPad only to help your dog acclimate to the system. Then only use BrilliantPad replacement rolls.


What if my dog likes to scratch or dig after going potty?
BrilliantPad rolls are very strong with a tear-resistant top sheet made with non-woven spun-bond fabric.  


How long will it take to train my dog to use BrilliantPad?
Most dogs that already use pads can transition to using BrilliantPad within a few weeks. If your dog does not use pads it will take more time, but generally no longer than it would to train a dog to use traditional pads.


What if my dog is often afraid of new experiences and new objects? 
If your dog is fearful of noises and new things, you will have to commit to following our training plan and invest extra time and effort to train your dog to use BrilliantPad.


What if I don’t have time to train my dog?
If you don’t have the time or patience necessary to train your dog, then BrilliantPad may not be right for you. Every dog needs at least several days to several weeks of training to acclimate to BrilliantPad.   


 



How do I set it up?
BrilliantPad is easy to setup. Attach covers, insert control module, add power and insert roll. Setup usually takes less than 10 minutes.


How do I manually advance the pad?
Press and hold the ""Pad Advance"" button to advance the paper, or double-click the same button to advance a full sheet.


How do I automatically advance pad?
Press ""automatic timer"" to replace pad automatically 1x, 2x or 3x per day -- that is once every 24, 12 or 8 hours, respectively.


How do I maintain the machine?
The entire take-up assembly is disposable. Just lift and remove. Everything soiled or dirty is discarded.


What about more extensive cleaning?
Little cleaning is required. Simply unlock and remove the control module. Then wash or hose away!


Can I put machine outside?
Only clean BrilliantPad outside. BrilliantPad is designed for indoor use only.

VentiFresh Eco Plus UVC Odor Eliminator is our answer to the call. Combining the same NASA inspired odor eliminating technology with the power of UV-C rays, this is the ultimate portable air purifier. Together we saw our respective life styles disrupted in the year 2020. While we’ve all worked diligently coping with the changes, some help from vibrant technologies may make things easier. Once again, the +UVC new model would not happen without your supports and encouragement. Thank you, all backers in this team VentiFresh!  How the technology works within the device.  The VentiFresh ECO device purifies indoor air by oxidizing the VOCs (ie. ammonia, formaldehyde etc.) and airborne microbes (ie. mold and bacteria) as they pass through the internal UV-photocatalyst core. However, it is not a conventional air purifier that is designed to clean up the air in large spaces or entire rooms by filtering the air. Instead of specifying a suitable room size or spatial dimensions for this product (such as the CADR index, which is the cubic feet per minute (CFM) of air that has all the particles of a given size distribution removed), this device does NOT use any filter to capture dirty particles in the air. The technology used is a natural photocatalyst process that breaks down harmful organic compounds into CO2 and water, rather than a filter that traps particles.  UVC lighting module joined force with the cleaning power of photocatalysis core, sanitizing strength tested and proven showing a 99.99% bactericidal activities, all packed into the compact unit that you can take anywhere by plugging into a USB power bank.  **The UV-C power designed in the VentiFresh products has been tested with anti-bacterial efficacy such as e. Coli. As the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, testing protocols are under development and medical devices have priority in laboratories. At this time, we are waiting for our partner laboratories to develop tests to confirm commercial products’ effectiveness against the novel virus. Upgraded germicidal efficiency with UV-C to the original UV-photocatalyst power.  VentiFresh significantly reduces the amount of molds growing on a controlled dish.

 
We put VentiFresh to the time-lapse test - the rotting slows down!


 
VentiFresh effectively reduces the amount of Formaldehyde concentration.

VentiFresh ECO Plus UVC model comes in 2 control modes to accommodate your usage needs, whereas the Turbo Mode runs in 30% higher speed meant for a ""quick fix"", and the Quite Mode runs softly in the background for long-hour use.  Based on previous user feedback, we developed new electronic design and assembly techniques to reduce the audible wind noise.

 

 

Weighted only 2.5oz!
Design to be compact (2x2.4 in/51x63mm) and lightweight (2.5oz/70g), VentiFresh devices may be installed on any smooth and clean surfaces using the enclosed gel-pad or double-sided stickers. You may choose to pair the device with a USB battery bank to allow for portable use, or pair with a USB adopter to plug into wall sockets. There is no battery inside the VentiFresh device. Power plug or power bank is not included in this product package.  We recommend using a qualified USB power plug or power bank that specified minimum DC5V/1A output, same like when you charge a mobile phone.
 


Regardless of the room size, we recommend installing the device within 1-2 ft (30-50 cm) of the source of indoor pollution, such as a toilet, cat litter box, trash cans and more. All VentiFresh devices come with a motor fan that draws in the nearby air and releases the clean breeze processed by the UV-photocatalyst core. The product functions to clean up microbes/odors close to the source before they pervade the entire room.

*VentiFresh test shows visible gas reduction      VentiFresh ECO combines the semiconductor deodorizer technology and air ventilation techniques, in such a compact function that has never been seen before.The applied semiconductors consists of photocatalyst and UV LED. A photocatalyst is a natural or synthetic substance that accelerates the rate of a molecular reaction using energy from light, without consuming itself. Chlorophyll of plants is a typical nature photocatalyst. We used a compound mainly consisted of titanium dioxide (TiO2). Simply speaking, our technology reversed the process of how plants breathe, and was used  to deodorize stinky molecules in the air. While chlorophyll captures sunlight to convert water and carbon dioxide into oxygen and glucose, our nano-grade substance at contact breaks down volatile organic compounds (VOCs), also known as odors in gas form, into carbon dioxide and water. Using a dust-resistant, low-noise motor fan, bad odor molecules in the air are pressured to flow inside an air compartment, get processed with a photocatalyst energized by UV light, then clean air flows out of VentiFresh ECO through air vents on the sides. Since the reaction is chemistry at the molecular level, odor compounds here are decomposed rather than captured by a filter, so there’s nothing to be replaced or refilled. VentiFresh ECO only needs energy from UV light to activate the cleaning process.The use of effective ventilation with photocatalyst and UV lighting for indoor air treatment has been a well-established application used in many places such as factories, hospitals, labs and homes. Such systems usually cost thousands of dollars to start with, and often are installed inside the existing air ventilation by professional services. **VentiFresh ECO is not an affiliate or associate with NASA.

It also has improved nano-material compounds (photocatalyst we used is a nano substance), specialized custom-made fiber carrier to form stronger, durable bonds with the photocatalyst, which results in improved processing power and 50% more efficiency decomposing VOCs (Variable Organic Compounds, odors) and molds. Mood lighting is incorporated to add a nice touch to your living space.Quiet mode - minimum fan noise while in use.Turbo mode - 30% more processing speed for faster results.Standby mode - calming mood lighting at power plug-in, standing by for operation. New silicone ring is added to protect the shiny and elegant housing.    FAQ Q: Can I use any USB power bank with VentiFresh ECO?Yes, VentiFresh ECO can pair with any DC5V power bankQ: How long do I need to turn it on every day? Depending on where you use VentiFresh ECO, the time needed to deodorize the air varies and can be decided by yourself. Just plug in when you feel the need to freshen up the air. For more stinky places, you may keep it running for more than 10 hours a day.  Q: Does the product need maintenance? How do I clean it? VentiFresh ECO is hassle free. There is nearly no maintenance required, there’s no replacing ﬁlter or reﬁll parts.  See the Product Specs above for care instructions.   Q: Will it use much electricity? If you keep a VentiFresh ECO running for 24 hours, it would cost less than $0.40 (residential rate at 2.16KW running 24/7) per month in most American states. Power costs refer to the latest average price of electricity by the US Department of Energy.   https://www.eia.gov/electricity/monthly/epm_tab...Q: Is the product safe to use?The product has passed Photobiological Safety Testing (IEC62471), which tested UV lighting reaction with animal eyes. Our product is classiﬁed as no hazard “exempt class”. It is safe to you and your pets. There are speculations on various types of photocatalyst products producing harmful by-products (chemicals). It is not related to our product design and usage because the product runs on low power DC5V and it’s used in the residential environment, not in the industrial environments where toxic chemicals are already present, and by-products may be possibly generated from processing these chemicals. The UV photocatalyst process of VentiFresh ECO mainly converts odor compounds into water vapor and carbon dioxide, in very small, almost undetectable amounts. The capacity of VentiFresh ECO yields much less water and carbon dioxide comparing with a human for the same period of time. Animals also breathe in air (a mixture of compounds) and exhale mainly water vapor and carbon dioxide.  Q. How much is shipping?The shipping cost is different for every perk and shipping location. Please select the perk you want, enter your shipping location, and a shipping cost will be calculated.Q. Will I have to pay customs and VAT?Contributors are generally responsible for assuring the product can be lawfully imported to the destination country. The recipient is the importer of record and must comply with all laws and regulations of the destination country. Orders may be subject to import taxes, customs duties, and fees which are levied once a shipment reaches the recipient's country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be fulfilled by the recipient. We have no control over these charges.Q. How long is the warranty?VentiFresh ECO comes with 1-year limited warranty for Indiegogo backers. We also ensure that every unit is free from manufacturer defects and handled with the utmost care during shipment. Q: Have any questions not listed here? Send us a message through the Ask a Question link above.Q: Interested in writing about us? Our press kit is available for download here.",49.0,8,"3 Campaigns

<br/>The main hardware consists of the <b>Server</b> (PC x86-64bit architecture yet)
 and the <b>Modules</b>. Some of the modules are bridges from one type of buses
 to the other type. Some of them are  input (digital or analogue)/output
 devices. The last but not least members of these hardware family are <b>Remote Sensors</b> (temperature, humidity, movement, pressure, access) and outputs for relay or RGB light-controller.<br/><p>Extension of
the system in terms of hardware is in certain cases the development
of additional hardware, such as a local switch or module RGB
lighting.</p>
<p><span>The system components are connected by wire, so that Sofia is suitable for newly constructed houses or renovated houses. But even already completed houses do not lose the comfort which Sofia provides. The wiring of Sofia is really not complicated. For majority of applications, the existing unused <span>structured wiring (originally designed for PC LAN) can be used</span>. In some future version of Sofia, we would like to focus especially on communication of individual components in the LAN network, That allows utilization of cables of home LAN that are already in use</span>.<br/></p>

<br/><p>Nowadays the
project has completed the prototype phase. At this stage, we tested the
complete system, which controls directly the heaters in the family
house, so we can say that currently Sofia supports the control and

to develop additional modules  of lighting and fire alarm system. And
rework the web interface for multilingual version.</p>
<p><b>UPDATE:We made the first step towards the transition to multi-language Sofia. We inserted support of selection and displaying different language versions into the WEB GUI.

<br/><h3>
<b>What
We Need </b>&amp; What You Get<br/>
</h3>
<p>We need financial
support mainly for the extension of Sofia's modules that were
mentioned,  system transformation to multilingual, subsequently the
start of serial production.<br/>Part of collected finance will be used
to full-time employment of hardware and software technicians that will
implement other hardware and software modules in Sofia – such as
access control (security system), fire protection systems, lighting
and air conditioning.<br/>We have created the prototype in the mother
language, but for the success of the project is very important that
Sofia must be available to the general public not only because low
prices, but also in proper language, so some of the money will be
used for the translation of texts used in Web GUI, and for the
adaptation of software to support language setup.</p>
<p><br/>It is fact
that the biggest is serial production the cheapest is one piece of the
final product.<br/>Therefore, we need huge amount of finances, so that
we could begin bigger serial production.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
With 100 pcs the price would be almost comparable to much larger
series (1000pcs series) but also production of 25pcs cheapens the
product enough that it is interesting for the beginning....<br/>Other
finance we need to buy additional development
hardware resources such as multichannel digital oscilloscope
with memory, PC pluggable and operating under Linux. And also
hardware development kit for the ARM architecture, and a draft of
hardware that is optimized for this architecture ....</p>
<p>If we won't get enough amounts of money, from what we gain, we
will mainly finance the transition to a multi-language, change to arm,
and the start of serial production ....<br/><br/><b>Perks  
:</b></p>
<p>We have two types of rewards:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Perks that are some <b>modules from
our production</b>. With these perks you support serial production, what allows reduction of prices and fulfillment of the main aim - the affordability for everyone. <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Perks which are <b>gifts</b> that makes support to
our project so we can achieve our aims. In these rewards the perk value is lower than the value of your gift (eg  15€ - LED USB flashlight,
50 € - frost effect mug with owlet - Sofia motive... etc...).  With this gifts you support further development of Sofia. Mainly the support for the multilinguality, movement to ARM and further creation of modules that expand the use of Sofia. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>The price of perks already includes shipping around the world. We will send packages by Slovak Postal Service, that can reach you almost anywhere.  In the specific case that you are on the place where it can't reach you, we'll contact you to decide further action.</p>

<br/>
<h3>
<b>Risks</b><br/>
</h3>
<p>The only problem in this stage of the
project is the lack of funding. If we have enough of Finance to
launch x piece series, it may happen that the cost per unit will be
too large to start the project in large-scale. We could get into a
vicious circle from which it is very difficult to escape: little
capital =&gt; small series =&gt; relatively high price =&gt; few
products sold (and  failure of one of the main objectives - to get
modern technology among ordinary people) =&gt; little capital for
further development.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>
<b>If you find our project interesting,
but you do not have funds</b>...<br/>
</h3>
<p>If you find our project interesting,
but you do not have funds that you can help us, you can help us with
translations. One of the aims is <b>multilanguality</b>, and any help with
translation into different languages will be welcomed.<br/>It is
possible that  if there was enough interest in helping us with the
translation, we'd do some system designed to manage the translation of texts, or some
forum where only the registered ones have access, and communicate
there with each other and manage the goals.</p>

Schematic representation of involvement Sofia Modules - specifically control of heating, lighting and access control systems:Sofia consists of two
main parts - the hardware and the software. Hardware consist of the Sofia Server and the Modules. Software consists of the core of the
system, who provides running of system and Web
GUI (Graphical User Interface).The substential part of the system
is software running on Debian, so the extension of the system is the
matter of  additional programming of other software modules. Web GUI
is built into the server. So on any client device is not
necessary to install or set anything. You can do complete setting on
each device with a modern web browser that supports HTML5. This
graphic interface has two levels - service and users level. Service
level is used to configure the foundations of the system so that
factory default system gets into a fully functioning state. The User
level is allowed to set the function settings, and programs such as
temperature, color or intensity of light.Home screen (only in Slovak language yet):UPDATE:And now in english:Screen from service level - hardware tree with hardware information and  ""search button"" (this button can find new hardware or hardware's changes): UPDATE:And now in english:Installation / circuit screen  - this is where ""service man"" can map sensors to right relay outputs and thus creating  the circuit:

UPDATE:And now in english:Circuits assignments - contains settings which user can control which circuits: UPDATE:And now in english:Regulation - the users can set how those regulated areas should behave:UPDATE:And now in english:The Sofia interface can be accessed directly as to any other website. Within a home Local Area Network you enter corresponding IP address to browser, and you can set. Of course thanks to OpenVPN technology and Internet you can access from anywhere in the world. Using this technology will establish a direct encryption tunnel leading from your device (PC, laptop, tablet, mobile phone ...) directly to your home  Sofia Server. This allows you to check from everywhere whether you remembered to turn off the lights or turn down heating when you're not there or raise the temperature when you're about to return home.Sofia connection with the outside world:Access through the Internet is possible directly and indirectly via encryption VPN tunnel.



Indirect tunnel is being redirected from your device through the VPN server to your Sofia Server. For such redirection you can use our VPN servers,
 as well as third-party (or your own) OpenVPN server. This method is independent of the type of Internet connection in your house. It is suitable for everyone, so it's recommended way of remote connection.


Direct tunnel is routed directly from your device to your Sofia Server. To establish a direct tunnel is necessary to have on your home Internet connection public IP address. Also you must be able to set up your home router to redirect one port directly to Sofia Server. If your public IP address is static, it is not necessary to do anything more. If
 your public IP address is dynamic (varies under some conditions) it is 
appropriate to use some of available free services  to pursue changes of your 
IP and update that address assigned with your domain. Such service offers for example noip.org.


Various options to access Sofia server via Internet:


The main hardware consists of the Server (PC x86-64bit architecture yet)
 and the Modules. Some of the modules are bridges from one type of buses
 to the other type. Some of them are  input (digital or analogue)/output
 devices. The last but not least members of these hardware family are Remote Sensors (temperature, humidity, movement, pressure, access) and outputs for relay or RGB light-controller.Extension of
the system in terms of hardware is in certain cases the development
of additional hardware, such as a local switch or module RGB
lighting.
The system components are connected by wire, so that Sofia is suitable for newly constructed houses or renovated houses. But even already completed houses do not lose the comfort which Sofia provides. The wiring of Sofia is really not complicated. For majority of applications, the existing unused structured wiring (originally designed for PC LAN) can be used. In some future version of Sofia, we would like to focus especially on communication of individual components in the LAN network, That allows utilization of cables of home LAN that are already in use.
Example of the hardware module - relay module (homemade prototype):



Nowadays the
project has completed the prototype phase. At this stage, we tested the
complete system, which controls directly the heaters in the family
house, so we can say that currently Sofia supports the control and
the regulation of heating.In the following months, we would like
to develop additional modules  of lighting and fire alarm system. And
rework the web interface for multilingual version.
UPDATE:We made the first step towards the transition to multi-language Sofia. We inserted support of selection and displaying different language versions into the WEB GUI. And we also prepared first lingual version- English. With this first language we would like to - with your kind help - make translations into many other languages.
First homemade tested prototypes:



Real In-House prototype - This is our first testing house where Sofia is based on classic PC architecture, and controls only heating:




What
We Need & What You Get

We need financial
support mainly for the extension of Sofia's modules that were
mentioned,  system transformation to multilingual, subsequently the
start of serial production.Part of collected finance will be used
to full-time employment of hardware and software technicians that will
implement other hardware and software modules in Sofia – such as
access control (security system), fire protection systems, lighting
and air conditioning.We have created the prototype in the mother
language, but for the success of the project is very important that
Sofia must be available to the general public not only because low
prices, but also in proper language, so some of the money will be
used for the translation of texts used in Web GUI, and for the
adaptation of software to support language setup.
It is fact
that the biggest is serial production the cheapest is one piece of the
final product.Therefore, we need huge amount of finances, so that
we could begin bigger serial production.



With 100 pcs the price would be almost comparable to much larger
series (1000pcs series) but also production of 25pcs cheapens the
product enough that it is interesting for the beginning....Other
finance we need to buy additional development
hardware resources such as multichannel digital oscilloscope
with memory, PC pluggable and operating under Linux. And also
hardware development kit for the ARM architecture, and a draft of
hardware that is optimized for this architecture ....
If we won't get enough amounts of money, from what we gain, we
will mainly finance the transition to a multi-language, change to arm,
and the start of serial production ....Perks  
:
We have two types of rewards:


Perks that are some modules from
our production. With these perks you support serial production, what allows reduction of prices and fulfillment of the main aim - the affordability for everyone. 

Perks which are gifts that makes support to
our project so we can achieve our aims. In these rewards the perk value is lower than the value of your gift (eg  15€ - LED USB flashlight,
50 € - frost effect mug with owlet - Sofia motive... etc...).  With this gifts you support further development of Sofia. Mainly the support for the multilinguality, movement to ARM and further creation of modules that expand the use of Sofia. 


The price of perks already includes shipping around the world. We will send packages by Slovak Postal Service, that can reach you almost anywhere.  In the specific case that you are on the place where it can't reach you, we'll contact you to decide further action.



Risks

The only problem in this stage of the
project is the lack of funding. If we have enough of Finance to
launch x piece series, it may happen that the cost per unit will be
too large to start the project in large-scale. We could get into a
vicious circle from which it is very difficult to escape: little
capital => small series => relatively high price => few
products sold (and  failure of one of the main objectives - to get
modern technology among ordinary people) => little capital for
further development.


If you find our project interesting,
but you do not have funds...

If you find our project interesting,
but you do not have funds that you can help us, you can help us with
translations. One of the aims is multilanguality, and any help with
translation into different languages will be welcomed.It is
possible that  if there was enough interest in helping us with the
translation, we'd do some system designed to manage the translation of texts, or some
forum where only the registered ones have access, and communicate
there with each other and manage the goals.",24.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>It is the newest, easiest and most compact way of grinding herbs in the 21st century.</p>
<p>Twisting and turning a grinder can be tough. Anyone who uses current hand grinders or a Mortar &amp; Pestle can tell you herb grinder technology is outdated and outmoded. With our Patent Pending design allows for ease of use and efficiency. GrindE is the replacement to the thousands year old Mortar and Pestle. </p>
<p>Recognizing this, we have developed GrindE as a major leap forward for the field, pioneering automated, cutting-edge design concepts that will make it easier for you to grind your herbs and spices. </p>
<p>Unlike traditional grinders, GrindE works automatically, its grind function turning on whenever you push the button at the top of the grinder. That means you will no longer need to throw your back and your shoulders into rotating the grinder blades, and running on a powerful battery, GrindE charges through a USB, just like all your favorite devices.</p>

</div></div>","What is GrindE?


 
It is the newest, easiest and most compact way of grinding herbs in the 21st century.
Twisting and turning a grinder can be tough. Anyone who uses current hand grinders or a Mortar & Pestle can tell you herb grinder technology is outdated and outmoded. With our Patent Pending design allows for ease of use and efficiency. GrindE is the replacement to the thousands year old Mortar and Pestle. 
Recognizing this, we have developed GrindE as a major leap forward for the field, pioneering automated, cutting-edge design concepts that will make it easier for you to grind your herbs and spices. 
Unlike traditional grinders, GrindE works automatically, its grind function turning on whenever you push the button at the top of the grinder. That means you will no longer need to throw your back and your shoulders into rotating the grinder blades, and running on a powerful battery, GrindE charges through a USB, just like all your favorite devices.

<h3>Our Why &amp; The Wiscloud Story</h3>
<p>Wiscloud is the brainchild of a team of entrepreneurs who realized the potential of home automation. In 2007, Wiscloud was formed with one purpose: to connect the world to the Internet of Things.</p>
<p>The patented technologies the system runs on a closed-circuit, meaning only you can access and control your devices. </p>
<h3>Cloud Computing &amp; The Internet Of Things</h3>
<p>Why we started Wiscloud and developed Nebula protocol and 7 other technologies in the first place is because the current smart home products on the market have many issues that make it a negative experience and not the seamless automation we set out to create:</p>
<ul>
<li>The different brand devices do not communicate and require different apps (too many apps are needed to control an entire home).</li>
<li>WiFi and Bluetooth networks are not reliable, have a short connecting distance and not secure enough against hacking. Zigbee and Z-Wave also have many cons.</li>
<li>Most systems still need users to give commands each time with a voice-enabled device or phone app, and that is not the fully automated/ A.I we envisioned.</li>
<li>Most home systems do not have the ability to handle smart business, the commercial industry or the potential of <strong>Smart Communities</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We think outside the box only to create a better solution for the average person to control their space conveniently and securely to maximize their technology's potential. </p>
<p>____________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>So we developed Wiscloud Smart system to be the most reliable, stable, secure Artificial Intelligence.</h2>

<h3>The system is compatible with many other brands' smart devices - letting you control them all in one place.</h3>
<p>While our company is a decade in business, our staff and innovative technological experts encompass over two decades of technology and computing platform experience.

The different brand devices do not communicate and require different apps (too many apps are needed to control an entire home).
WiFi and Bluetooth networks are not reliable, have a short connecting distance and not secure enough against hacking. Zigbee and Z-Wave also have many cons.
Most systems still need users to give commands each time with a voice-enabled device or phone app, and that is not the fully automated/ A.I we envisioned.
Most home systems do not have the ability to handle smart business, the commercial industry or the potential of Smart Communities.

We think outside the box only to create a better solution for the average person to control their space conveniently and securely to maximize their technology's potential. 
____________________________________________________________________________
 
So we developed Wiscloud Smart system to be the most reliable, stable, secure Artificial Intelligence.

The system is compatible with many other brands' smart devices - letting you control them all in one place.
While our company is a decade in business, our staff and innovative technological experts encompass over two decades of technology and computing platform experience. Our CEO John Hu, alone comes from an extensive background as an IOT Master, bringing his experience and his innovation to Wiscloud to help connect the world and maximize the potential of our technology.

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>A solution to this problem my family is using is our Ultimate Sock Organizer with a simple way of numbering socks of the same pair. By ironing a numbered Sticker to the bottom of a sock, each sock gets a number – the same number as it's pair. There is also a pocket reserved in the Sock Holder (a wardrobe organizer bag) for that pair of socks. Once you have washed and ironed a sock, put it in the Sock Holder's pocket marked with the matching number. Later in the day (or maybe another day!) you will have stumbled upon the other sock from that pair. After washing it, as you are putting it in its pocket in the Sock Holder, you'll notice that the other sock was there already! Now you can fold them both together in a little sock-ball and return them to their pocket.</p>
<p>When choosing the socks to wear for the day, choose from the pockets that have paired balls in them, and not the single ones. If you do not fold your socks into balls, let the single socks stick out of their pockets a little bit to set them apart from the paired ones.</p>
<p>My name is Stjepan Lucic. I have been working for a major international telecommunications vendor for over 20 years now. My experience there has thought me the importance of doing things in a time-efficient manner or money gets lost. But this is not about the time I could save for work, as much as it is about the precious free time I have available for spending with my family having fun. Which is why I am often finding myself pondering how to reduce the time we are wasting on reoccurring tasks nobody in our family likes to do?</p>
<p>The Ultimate Sock Organizer I am asking your support for is a helping tool we are finding so useful I have decided to try and turn into an actual product.</p>
<p>Our Ultimate Sock Organizer product will consist of a Sock Holder and an accompanying set of iron‑on transferrable Stickers with protection paper for ironing.</p>
<p>The Sock Holder will be a dual-sided, closet-hanging transparent storage with approx. 50 pockets, each pocket holding one pair of socks. The pockets will be optimized for size so that they fit a pair of folded socks just neatly to save space. Each pocket will be clearly numbered, starting from 1 up to the number of pockets.</p>
<p>The Sticker Set will contain as many pairs of Stickers as there are pockets in the Sock Holder. Each Sticker Pair will also be numbered, starting from 1 up to the number of pockets. Stickers in a pair will be labeled by the same number. The Sticker Set will be accompanied by a transparent protection paper that is to be used for ironing Stickers to socks.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We need the funds to kick-start the production of first 1.000 of our Ultimate Sock Organizers. And if within the first 1.000 of our $30 USD supporters, you'll get one to help you solve your own sock-pairing conundrums!</p>
<p>We also hope you will help us realize this innovative product promptly, as now that the idea has been put in the open, anyone can swoosh by and start the production before we do. If you cannot contribute, then spread the word out and make some noise about our campaign. Or simply use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>
<p>If you will support us, please also indicate your suggestion about where would you like the funds to go if the campaign does not reach the entire goal and if we do not succeed going into production.</p>
<p>The market price for two-sided general organizers containing over 40 pockets is about 20 USD. Our Sock Holders will have approx. 50 numbered pockets. The market price for general purpose iron‑on transfer sticker package with the required number of stickers is approx. 10 USD. We estimate the shipping costs to 10 USD (they are dependent on destination).</p>
<p>Although a household should have one Ultimate Sock Organizer for each family member, we aim at 1.000 of you to support us by choosing to pre-order a single Sock Organizer. So we have set the funding required to 1.000 x 30 USD = 30.000 USD.</p>
<p>With the funds raised we will start the production of our Ultimate Sock Organizer.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Let’s make the world a more fun place: instead of losing time for pairing socks, we could gain hundreds of millions of months for fun!!!</p>
<p>And instead of being frustrated when half of pair is missing, you personally could frolic each time the other sock is already waiting in its pocket for the one you have just washed.</p>

<p>Formed in late 2013, Soundtronics is a relatively new
division of the Technobots Online Group, passionate about making quality
analogue synths more widely available and affordable. Technobots Online is well established,  having supplied mechanical and electronic components to hobbyists, education,
and trade since 2001. This means that ideal component suppliers, manufacturing
equipment, and delivery services are already in place for the modular synths.  </p>
<p>Located in Warwickshire, the Technobots Online
team consists of technology enthusiasts, each with their own particular passions.
Soundtronics, and the DIY MFOS Synth module project, have the benefit of being

<p>Music From Outer Space is run by another
synthesiser enthusiast, Ray Wilson, in the USA. Back in 2003, Ray began
publishing synth designs that have continued to evolve and gain credibility
over the years. If you are not familiar with Ray’s superb designs, we cannot
stress enough how essential it is that you visit his website <a href=""http://www.musicfromouterspace.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">musicfromouterspace.com</a>, where you will
find a complete library of information on each and every module we are offering
here. </p>
<p>We will also mention that you can purchase PCBs
direct from Ray, along with some front panels and other hard to find parts.</p>
<p><b>Important Update</b></p>
<p>Last November, just around the time we were going to launch this campaign, we learnt of the sad news that Ray had been diagnosed with cancer. In order for Ray and his family to fully concentrate on beating this, he stopped taking retail orders through the MFOS website. We are deeply appreciative of Ray finding the energy during these 
difficult times to keep us stocked with PCBs, so that we in turn keep 
them available online to MFOS builders around the world.</p>
<p>Since postponing this campaign, we have had the opportunity to discuss the essential role of MFOS in this Soundtronics' campaign, and Ray has encouraged us to move forward.  We shall therefore be working with Ray over the coming months to not only ensure the availability of the MFOS product range, but make it the most complete DIY synth range on the market.</p>
<p>Many of us have been directly or indirectly affected by cancer, so we would like to take this opportunity to ask that you consider visiting Ray's <a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/raywilson"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">crowd funding site</a> where you can directly contribute to Ray's medical expenses. <br/></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445274407/ixqbungc9g4yehifctwc.png"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p>Without sounding cliché, Soundtronics is quickly
becoming a one stop shop for all modular synth products. Our buying power
enables us to source difficult to find components at good prices, passing the
savings on to you and, of course, saving you all of the hassle of sourcing them
yourself. </p>
<p>Our current range of in-house manufacturing
equipment means we can produce our front panels and provide a full assembly
service to those who do not wish to partake in the DIY element. </p>
<p>Again, it is worth mentioning that we fully
support and appreciate all of Ray’s work, so we continue to pay the full retail
value for all PCBs.</p>

<p>Over the last 18 months, we’ve supplied
kits to enthusiasts across Europe and received excellent feedback. Our

<br/><span></span><p><span>However, as with all new products, some customers have kindly suggested
some improvements for us to make. Now, that’s where your support comes in.</span></p>
<p>Firstly, we’d love to continue receiving
feedback, good or bad, as it really helps us to understand exactly what you
want from our products. Therefore, at the end of this campaign we’ll be setting
up a forum for you to chat to us, help each other out with
projects, and benefit from our technical resources.</p>
<b>What are we funding?</b><br/>The first improvement we will to put into action,
is the introduction of a machined aluminium reinforcement layer, opposed to the
current acrylic panel, behind the laser engraved laminate panel. This will
allow us to reduce the depth of the modules, thus opening up a raft of
opportunities for additional formats such as Euro Rack. Aluminium panels are
are also the perfect solution for producing panels for the single boards
synths, so the extra equipment and investment in design time will be well utilised. <br/><br/><p>We have already invested in a CNC router to
produce the machined aluminium panels and a laser to engraver to cut out the
front laminate panels. We will therefore use funds raised from this campaign to invest in
PCB production for panel controls, and to design and produce front panels for new formats
and single board synths.</p>
<p>Secondly, we want to produce a range of PCBs for
panel controls, in order to reduce panel wiring and speed up assembly. Paul will be our lead
R&amp;D expert on this, and has already begun building prototypes.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447965442/kx2ggojhr9mvoqf6v1e8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Essentially, we’d like to invest in further
research, design and development, manufacturing equipment, and up-front manufacturing
runs.</p>

<li>Main PCB - The official PCB manufactured by MFOS, no other components included. Ideal for the DIY builder who has access to their own components and wishes to create their own front panel.</li>
<li>Wiring PCB Set - Bare PCBs manufactured by Soundtronics to simplify construction. These PCBs are used to reduce the amount of panel wiring by soldering most, if not all, of the pots and connectors directly on the PCBs. These PCBs have various solderable options, i.e. creating common ground connections. Each PCB has a JST socket into which is plugged a cable, the other end of each cable is then soldered to the main PCB. Each Wiring PCB Set includes PCBs, JST connectors, cable assemblies  and pot brackets.</li>
<li>Components Kit - All electronic components required to complete the build of the corresponding main PCB.  Top quality components from metal film resistors upwards. Excludes panel mount potentiometers, sockets and switches.</li>
<li>Pots &amp; Sockets - Includes all panel mount potentiometers, Switchcraft 1/4"" sockets, switches and our Cliff KM20B knobs. These are most suitable for MOTM 5U size panels, but we will change the contents on request to suit Euro rack formats i.e. 3.5mm jack sockets.</li>
<li>Engraved Panel - Our own laser engraved laminate panels available as white on black, black on brushed aluminium plus other colours on request. These engraved panels really look the part and are hard wearing, no screen print rubbing off! The engraved panels are about 1.5mm thick but do require a rigid backing sheet to provide the necessary rigidity. To date, we have used an acrylic framework that also accommodates the PCB, however our new design uses an aluminium panel behind.</li>
<li>Aluminium Chassis Plate - A 6082 T6 aluminium panel 3mm thick (2mm for Euro rack) with all holes routed out to match the engraved front panel. Being aluminium, it also provides electrical screening. Also includes an acrylic panel and brackets to which the main PCB is mounted to.</li>
<li>Full Kit - Basically all of the above, everything the DIYer needs to build the module / noise box / sequencer / single board synth, even down to the wiring.</li>
<li>
Fully Assembled - For those without the necessary tools / equipment / experience / time. We will build the kit and fully test it so it's ready to use.<br/>
</li>
</ul>

<p>As well as supporting through the purchase of
Perks, there are other ways you can help us in achieving our aims.</p>
<p>Please let other similar minded builders and
musicians know about this campaign through forums and social media. </p>

<b>What happens if you don't get all of the funding?</b><br/>
<p>Our business model is such that even if we don't
reach our goal, we will be able to honour all perks purchased thanks to our
in-house capabilities. It will mean that we will not be able to bulk buy PCBs
and it may constrain future development of our synth products.</p>
<p><b>What are the risks?</b><br/>
As with all projects, there will be challenges to
overcome in fulfilling this campaign. Fortunately for us, we have a great
support structure in place in the form of the Technobots infrastructure, and a
team of experienced project managers and engineers. <br/></p>

but to give you a heads up:<br/><br/><p>Manufacturing: Being a small team, we’ve only invested in one
each of larger manufacturing equipment such as the CNC cutter and laser
engraver.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447443062/dmagy7udmz6t00rcb5xe.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>This does leave us vulnerable to machine failure, but we make sure we
maintain our equipment regularly so as to reduce the probability of issues. <br/><br/><p>The Team: Of course, in a smaller team, there is little
room for illness or loss of working hours. However, we operate the same
strategy as we do with our machinery – don’t overwork them and keep them
properly oiled (perhaps with a beer or two on a Friday afternoon!)</p>
<p>Supply chain: We depend on MFOS for the main PCBs and, without going into detail here, we have a number of contingency options available to ensure the continued supply. Unfortunately, this particular mitigation strategy has already been put to test. If you have not already, please read the section 'MFOS - Who are they?' above. All other components in the kits are available from multiple sources, so we are still able to use the original specified components. A small number of components are becoming obsolete, and are thus quite rare, however substitutes are possible.  We also share our stock holding with that of Technobots to ensure a ready supply.</p>

Music From Outer Space is run by another

We will also mention that you can purchase PCBs

Important Update
Last November, just around the time we were going to launch this campaign, we learnt of the sad news that Ray had been diagnosed with cancer. In order for Ray and his family to fully concentrate on beating this, he stopped taking retail orders through the MFOS website. We are deeply appreciative of Ray finding the energy during these

Since postponing this campaign, we have had the opportunity to discuss the essential role of MFOS in this Soundtronics' campaign, and Ray has encouraged us to move forward.  We shall therefore be working with Ray over the coming months to not only ensure the availability of the MFOS product range, but make it the most complete DIY synth range on the market.
Many of us have been directly or indirectly affected by cancer, so we would like to take this opportunity to ask that you consider visiting Ray's crowd funding site where you can directly contribute to Ray's medical expenses. 

Without sounding cliché, Soundtronics is quickly
becoming a one stop shop for all modular synth products. Our buying power
enables us to source difficult to find components at good prices, passing the
savings on to you and, of course, saving you all of the hassle of sourcing them

service to those who do not wish to partake in the DIY element. 
Again, it is worth mentioning that we fully
support and appreciate all of Ray’s work, so we continue to pay the full retail
value for all PCBs.



Over the last 18 months, we’ve supplied
kits to enthusiasts across Europe and received excellent feedback. Our
laser engraved laminate front panels look great, and generally last much longer
than their screen printed counter parts.  


However, as with all new products, some customers have kindly suggested
some improvements for us to make. Now, that’s where your support comes in.

mix voucher, to spend however you wish. Don't worry if the amount you want to spend finishes between Perk values, simply purchase the nearest value below your spend, and we will then request the difference at the end of the campaign through PayPal.
We have, of course, listed some Early Bird specials
where you get that bit extra to spend on us!
Check out the info-graphics below for an overview
of our perks and module options.
For more detailed information, please download the order
form in Excel format or PDF.
Please note that all pricing is inclusive of VAT, delivery addresses outside of the EU will have the VAT element refunded prior to dispatch.



 Kit Options
Main PCB - The official PCB manufactured by MFOS, no other components included. Ideal for the DIY builder who has access to their own components and wishes to create their own front panel.
Wiring PCB Set - Bare PCBs manufactured by Soundtronics to simplify construction. These PCBs are used to reduce the amount of panel wiring by soldering most, if not all, of the pots and connectors directly on the PCBs. These PCBs have various solderable options, i.e. creating common ground connections. Each PCB has a JST socket into which is plugged a cable, the other end of each cable is then soldered to the main PCB. Each Wiring PCB Set includes PCBs, JST connectors, cable assemblies  and pot brackets.
Components Kit - All electronic components required to complete the build of the corresponding main PCB.  Top quality components from metal film resistors upwards. Excludes panel mount potentiometers, sockets and switches.
Pots & Sockets - Includes all panel mount potentiometers, Switchcraft 1/4"" sockets, switches and our Cliff KM20B knobs. These are most suitable for MOTM 5U size panels, but we will change the contents on request to suit Euro rack formats i.e. 3.5mm jack sockets.
Engraved Panel - Our own laser engraved laminate panels available as white on black, black on brushed aluminium plus other colours on request. These engraved panels really look the part and are hard wearing, no screen print rubbing off! The engraved panels are about 1.5mm thick but do require a rigid backing sheet to provide the necessary rigidity. To date, we have used an acrylic framework that also accommodates the PCB, however our new design uses an aluminium panel behind.
Aluminium Chassis Plate - A 6082 T6 aluminium panel 3mm thick (2mm for Euro rack) with all holes routed out to match the engraved front panel. Being aluminium, it also provides electrical screening. Also includes an acrylic panel and brackets to which the main PCB is mounted to.
Full Kit - Basically all of the above, everything the DIYer needs to build the module / noise box / sequencer / single board synth, even down to the wiring.

Fully Assembled - For those without the necessary tools / equipment / experience / time. We will build the kit and fully test it so it's ready to use.



As well as supporting through the purchase of
Perks, there are other ways you can help us in achieving our aims.
Please let other similar minded builders and
musicians know about this campaign through forums and social media. 
Share your experience and expertise on our user
group after the campaign ends.

What happens if you don't get all of the funding?
Our business model is such that even if we don't
reach our goal, we will be able to honour all perks purchased thanks to our
in-house capabilities. It will mean that we will not be able to bulk buy PCBs
and it may constrain future development of our synth products.
What are the risks?
As with all projects, there will be challenges to
overcome in fulfilling this campaign. Fortunately for us, we have a great
support structure in place in the form of the Technobots infrastructure, and a
team of experienced project managers and engineers. 

We’re not too worried about any of these risks,
but to give you a heads up:Manufacturing: Being a small team, we’ve only invested in one
each of larger manufacturing equipment such as the CNC cutter and laser
engraver.

This does leave us vulnerable to machine failure, but we make sure we
maintain our equipment regularly so as to reduce the probability of issues. The Team: Of course, in a smaller team, there is little
room for illness or loss of working hours. However, we operate the same
strategy as we do with our machinery – don’t overwork them and keep them
properly oiled (perhaps with a beer or two on a Friday afternoon!)
Supply chain: We depend on MFOS for the main PCBs and, without going into detail here, we have a number of contingency options available to ensure the continued supply. Unfortunately, this particular mitigation strategy has already been put to test. If you have not already, please read the section 'MFOS - Who are they?' above. All other components in the kits are available from multiple sources, so we are still able to use the original specified components. A small number of components are becoming obsolete, and are thus quite rare, however substitutes are possible.  We also share our stock holding with that of Technobots to ensure a ready supply.


Thank you for reading and we sincerely do hope you can support us in taking DIY synth building to this new level.",25.0,1,"1 Campaign

</p><h3><b>What is the GECCO?</b></h3>
<p><b>The GECCO is a wireless tank water heater control unit</b>. It attaches directly to your
water heater and connects to your smart devices enabling you to automate your water heater
so that it is only on when you need it.</p>
<p>Did you know that <b>one storage tank water heater </b>puts out as
much as <b><a href=""http://www.co2list.org/files/carbon.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">1,000 lbs. of carbon</a> </b>into the air <b>every single year</b>? Now imagine <b>tens of millions
of water heaters </b>doing the same every single day and night. It is estimated
that in the <b>US alone</b>, nearly <b><a href=""http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/product.aspx/productid/27"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">170 million metric tons of</a> </b><a href=""http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/product.aspx/productid/27"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>carbon </b></a>is emitted! No
matter what your take is on environmental sustainability, <b>this can’t be good.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On top of the carbon emissions, water heating constitutes <a href=""http://energy.gov/articles/new-infographic-and-projects-keep-your-energy-bills-out-hot-water"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>14% - 18% </b></a><b>of your monthly energy bill.
</b>In order to keep your water hot all day, your
water heater must keep reheating the water to the desired temperature, <b>which is why it costs so much. </b>While the
water heater keeps the water hot, it also loses heat due to what is called <a href=""http://energy.gov/energysaver/articles/storage-water-heaters"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>stand-by heat loss </b></a>– <b>the
heat seeps out through the walls of the tank</b>. It is possible to wrap your water heater, <b>but why
even have it on at all when you’re not using it?</b></span></p>
<p>Why do water heaters emit so much carbon and cost so much? Well, the <b>average
family uses hot water only 2-3 hours a day</b>, and for the most part, <b>never adjusts the temperature gauge or turns it off</b>. The water heater stays on <b>24 hours a day </b>even
when one leaves home for work, school, errands or even vacation. Leaving
your water heater constantly running <b>wastes the planet’s natural resources… and, of course, your money!</b></p>
<p>The <b>GECCO </b>addresses this problem by
helping you <b>use your water heater smartly without sacrificing your comfort</b>.
The <b>GECCO </b>allows you to <b>preset the times </b>that you know you will need hot water; and should you need
hot water at an unscheduled time, our“<b>On-Demand</b>”
system can activate your water heater by simply turning on your hot water
anywhere in the house. <b>Five minutes before you need it,
it’s ready to go!</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3>GECCO Mission Statement:</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>Our mission is to
empower property owners with water heater control technology that helps users lower their energy costs, reduce their carbon emissions and enjoy piece of mind.</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p>
<h3><b>Why is Now the Right Time for the GECCO?</b></h3>
<p>The world at large is learning more and more about how and why <b>environmental sustainability matters</b>.
Engineering on cars and trucks now universally <a href=""http://energy.gov/articles/infographic-road-fuel-efficiency"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>prioritizes
fuel efficiency</b></a>. <a href=""http://www.solarcity.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>SolarCity</b></a>, the <b>#1 leading provider of solar power panels </b>for home and business, is
proving that clean energy is <b>increasingly more </b><a href=""http://solar.solarcity.com/salestools/solarcity.aspx?rep=00514000009tEsk"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>attractive</b></a>. And if you have heard of the <a href=""https://nest.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>NEST Learning Thermostat</b></a>, you know that this type of
technology is <a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/google-closes-3-2-billion-purchase-of-nest/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>really taking
off</b></a>. Why? Because the value is
clear and people everywhere are
joining in to help do their part to improve the environment.</p>
<p>The <b>GECCO </b>is one more step in that direction. If we currently
emit <b><a href=""http://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/appliance_standards/product.aspx/productid/27"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">170 million metric tons</a> </b>of carbon into the atmosphere by leaving
our water heaters on 24 ours a day, imagine the reduction in pollution by
turning them off for <b>20 of those hours</b>? We’re talking potentially <b>120 million </b>tons of
carbon taken out of the atmosphere! <b>That feels good</b>.</p><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><h3><b><span>How Does the GECCO Work?</span></b></h3>
<p>The
<b>GECCO </b>comes equipped with the
following <b>capabilities</b>:</p>
<p>· <b> Control
your water heater using the GECCO from your computer, smart-device and control box (included
with GECCO purchase).</b></p>
<p><b>·<span>  </span>Turn the water heater on when you need it
and off when you don't.</b></p>
<p><b>·<span> 
</span>Preset
desired times that you will need hot water.</b></p>
<p><b>·<span>  </span>""On
Demand” capability for unscheduled heating.</b></p>
<p><b>·<span>  </span>Measure water heater use with informative analytics.</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>· Configure the GECCO for battery or solar power. </b></p><p><b>· Hot water re-circulation control ready. </b></p><p><b></b></p><p><b>· GECCO automatically responds to outside air temperature fluctuation. </b></p><p><b>·  No installation assistance needed! The
GECCO is VERY simple to install and use. Older units may require tools that will come with the GECCO. </b></p><p><b><br/></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>What does this mean for you?
Here is how you benefit:</p>
<p>·<span>  </span><b>Enjoy
peace of mind knowing that you are making an effort to be more energy efficient.</b></p>
<p><b>·<span>  </span>Remotely control the water heater from anywhere.</b></p>
<p><b>·<span> 
</span>Preserve
natural resources.</b></p>
<p><b>·<span>  </span>Reduce the amount of carbon emitted into
the atmosphere.</b></p>
<p><b>·  Save anywhere from an estimated $0.50 to
$1.50 per day!</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>The <b>GECCO
</b>comes in <b>3 great designs</b>: <b>Rainbow, Jungle Camouflage and Desert Camouflage</b>. Since our company is  <b>100% owned by veterans</b>, of whom <b>80% are combat disabled</b>, we felt that
the camouflage units would be a nice touch.</p>
<h3>Remember, because
the GECCO saves you so much money off your heating bill, the GECCO pays itself off in less than a year!</h3><div><br/></div>
<h3><b>How Do We Know That the GECCO Works?</b></h3>
<p>With
the current prototype, we ran a few tests to see just how valuable the GECCO
could be. We ran tests on three
houses, a restaurant and a shopping center with five stores in it.</p>
<p><b>Home 1: </b>Two adults. Their water
heater was automated to run one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening. <b>The GECCO saved them about $1.00 a day.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Home 2: </b>Two adults, two children.
Their water heater was automated to run one hour in the morning and three
in the evening. <b>The GECCO saved them
about $0.75 cents a day.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>
</p><p><b><span>Home 3: </span></b>This
house had 1 adult and there was a re-circulation pump in use. Their circulation pump cools the water down more so the water heater runs more.
Their water heater was automated to
run one hour in the morning and one in the evening. <b>The GECCO saved them about $1.30 a day.</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The Restaurant: </b>The
restaurant was open from 6 am to 2 pm, 7 days a week. Their water heater was
automated to run 8 hours on and 16 hours off. <b>The GECCO saved the restaurant nearly $2 a day!</b></p>
<p><b>The shopping center: </b>It had a re-circulation pump, but the stores were closed on the weekend so the water heater ran 40 hours a
week instead of 168 hours a week. <b>The
GECCO saved the shopping center
$2.50 a day.</b></p>
<p>To
measure the gas usage, we used the <b>Elster
Gas Meter bk-g4</b>. These savings are approximate and could vary depending on gas rates,
location of water heaters indoors or out and weather conditions.</p>
<p>We
calculated the gas usage for one month with the GECCO on and a month with it off.</p>
<h3>These savings range from $200 - $900 per year!</h3><div><br/></div>
<h3><b>The GECCO Works With…</b></h3>
<p>The <b>GECCO </b>works with <b>storage tank water heaters</b>. Because
water is held in the tank <b>24 hours a day</b>, the <b>standby heat loss </b>and <b>sheer
non-stop energy usage </b>makes the <b>GECCO </b>the smart option. To be
fair, however, you could go with other options such as…</p>
<p>· <b>
Instantaneous
“Tankless”/ “On-Demand” Water
Heater: $175 - $1200 for each water
fixture</b></p>
<p><b>·<span>  </span>Wi-Fi Enabled Heat Pump Water Heater:
$900 - $2500</b></p>
<p><b>·  Wi-Fi Enabled Conventional Storage Water
Heater: $500 -$900</b></p><p><b>With the GECCO, you get the value of these three for only $75 during the campaign! </b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Clearly, going these alternative routes will indeed achieve what the GECCO offers, but the cost is prohibitively expensive. These costs don’t include
shipping, installation and taxes.</p><p><b>The three types of control valves that the GECCO fits look like this:</b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1420527/files/20150427191520-valve-model-1.jpg?1430187320"" src="""" style=""width: 515.874587458746px; height: 290px;""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1416657/files/20150426131207-110-206-5.jpg?1430079127"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; width: 263px; height: 263px; background-color: initial;""/>         <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1420553/files/20150427192607-gascontrol.jpg?1430187967"" src="""" style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; width: 291.15671641791px; height: 270px; background-color: initial;""/></p><p>          </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1420546/files/20150427192406-Icon-Honeywell-1500.gif?1430187846"" src="""" style=""width: 211.393805309735px; height: 195px;""/>               <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1383638/files/20150414174201-Control_Valve_2.jpeg?1429058521"" src="""" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; width: 206.107594936709px; height: 195px; background-color: initial;""/></p><br/><p><br/></p>

So in trying to do my share I would turn off my water heater when I was away from my house. It was a manual process, but worth doing. Several years ago, my wife and I went on a trip and, as always, turned off our water heater. The next morning, after returning back late, I heard some rough words coming from the bathroom where my wife was taking a shower!</blockquote><blockquote>
<b>I soon learned that I had forgot to turn the water heater back on the night before.</b>  At that point I realized that I needed to develop a remote capability for my water heater. After some simple research I realized that we only needed hot water several hours a day.<b> I did not leave my cars running all night  because we needed them the next day, why was my water heater keeping water hot 100% of the time when I only needed it 10% of the time.</b> </blockquote><blockquote>So over the last couple of years I have developed and built several prototypes and developed the one that finally meets all my needs. You can program it to go on and off when you need or do not need hot water. So no more cool showers for my wife! It has an on demand capability, so you can turn it on by just turning on the hot water anywhere in the house for a second. It runs on batteries, solar or household voltage. It can be controlled by any smart device and it can even detect a leak in your water heater. The latest prototype requires no tools and can be installed in less than a minute. I have named this unit the GECCO, Green, Energy, Efficient, Cost, Conservation, Optimizer.""</blockquote><blockquote><p style=""text-align: right;""><b>Bo Hayner, Inventor of the GECCO  </b>   </p></blockquote><h3><b>Testimonials</b></h3><div><b><br/></b></div><div>

</div></div>","We are excited to introduce you to an innovative product that will lower your energy cost, reduce your carbon footprint, and enable you to leave a greener planet for the future. Meet the GECCO - Green Energy Efficient Cost Conservation Optimizer. Desert Camouflage                                                        Jungle Camouflage                                                        Rainbow                                                                    Smart Device App Screen                                                  
















What is the GECCO?
The GECCO is a wireless tank water heater control unit. It attaches directly to your
water heater and connects to your smart devices enabling you to automate your water heater
so that it is only on when you need it.
Did you know that one storage tank water heater puts out as
much as 1,000 lbs. of carbon into the air every single year? Now imagine tens of millions
of water heaters doing the same every single day and night. It is estimated
that in the US alone, nearly 170 million metric tons of carbon is emitted! No
matter what your take is on environmental sustainability, this can’t be good.


On top of the carbon emissions, water heating constitutes 14% - 18% of your monthly energy bill.
In order to keep your water hot all day, your
water heater must keep reheating the water to the desired temperature, which is why it costs so much. While the
water heater keeps the water hot, it also loses heat due to what is called stand-by heat loss – the
heat seeps out through the walls of the tank. It is possible to wrap your water heater, but why
even have it on at all when you’re not using it?
Why do water heaters emit so much carbon and cost so much? Well, the average
family uses hot water only 2-3 hours a day, and for the most part, never adjusts the temperature gauge or turns it off. The water heater stays on 24 hours a day even
when one leaves home for work, school, errands or even vacation. Leaving
your water heater constantly running wastes the planet’s natural resources… and, of course, your money!
The GECCO addresses this problem by
helping you use your water heater smartly without sacrificing your comfort.
The GECCO allows you to preset the times that you know you will need hot water; and should you need
hot water at an unscheduled time, our“On-Demand”
system can activate your water heater by simply turning on your hot water
anywhere in the house. Five minutes before you need it,
it’s ready to go!
GECCO Mission Statement:

Our mission is to
empower property owners with water heater control technology that helps users lower their energy costs, reduce their carbon emissions and enjoy piece of mind.
Why is Now the Right Time for the GECCO?
The world at large is learning more and more about how and why environmental sustainability matters.
Engineering on cars and trucks now universally prioritizes
fuel efficiency. SolarCity, the #1 leading provider of solar power panels for home and business, is
proving that clean energy is increasingly more attractive. And if you have heard of the NEST Learning Thermostat, you know that this type of
technology is really taking
off. Why? Because the value is
clear and people everywhere are
joining in to help do their part to improve the environment.
The GECCO is one more step in that direction. If we currently
emit 170 million metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere by leaving
our water heaters on 24 ours a day, imagine the reduction in pollution by
turning them off for 20 of those hours? We’re talking potentially 120 million tons of
carbon taken out of the atmosphere! That feels good.


How Does the GECCO Work?
The
GECCO comes equipped with the
following capabilities:
·  Control
your water heater using the GECCO from your computer, smart-device and control box (included
with GECCO purchase).
·  Turn the water heater on when you need it
and off when you don't.
· 
Preset
desired times that you will need hot water.
·  ""On
Demand” capability for unscheduled heating.
·  Measure water heater use with informative analytics.· Configure the GECCO for battery or solar power. · Hot water re-circulation control ready. · GECCO automatically responds to outside air temperature fluctuation. ·  No installation assistance needed! The
GECCO is VERY simple to install and use. Older units may require tools that will come with the GECCO. 

What does this mean for you?
Here is how you benefit:
·  Enjoy
peace of mind knowing that you are making an effort to be more energy efficient.
·  Remotely control the water heater from anywhere.
· 
Preserve
natural resources.
·  Reduce the amount of carbon emitted into
the atmosphere.
·  Save anywhere from an estimated $0.50 to
$1.50 per day!

The GECCO
comes in 3 great designs: Rainbow, Jungle Camouflage and Desert Camouflage. Since our company is  100% owned by veterans, of whom 80% are combat disabled, we felt that
the camouflage units would be a nice touch.
Remember, because
the GECCO saves you so much money off your heating bill, the GECCO pays itself off in less than a year!
How Do We Know That the GECCO Works?
With
the current prototype, we ran a few tests to see just how valuable the GECCO
could be. We ran tests on three
houses, a restaurant and a shopping center with five stores in it.
Home 1: Two adults. Their water
heater was automated to run one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening. The GECCO saved them about $1.00 a day.

Home 2: Two adults, two children.
Their water heater was automated to run one hour in the morning and three
in the evening. The GECCO saved them
about $0.75 cents a day.


Home 3: This
house had 1 adult and there was a re-circulation pump in use. Their circulation pump cools the water down more so the water heater runs more.
Their water heater was automated to
run one hour in the morning and one in the evening. The GECCO saved them about $1.30 a day.

The Restaurant: The
restaurant was open from 6 am to 2 pm, 7 days a week. Their water heater was
automated to run 8 hours on and 16 hours off. The GECCO saved the restaurant nearly $2 a day!
The shopping center: It had a re-circulation pump, but the stores were closed on the weekend so the water heater ran 40 hours a
week instead of 168 hours a week. The
GECCO saved the shopping center
$2.50 a day.
To
measure the gas usage, we used the Elster
Gas Meter bk-g4. These savings are approximate and could vary depending on gas rates,
location of water heaters indoors or out and weather conditions.
We
calculated the gas usage for one month with the GECCO on and a month with it off.
These savings range from $200 - $900 per year!
The GECCO Works With…
The GECCO works with storage tank water heaters. Because
water is held in the tank 24 hours a day, the standby heat loss and sheer
non-stop energy usage makes the GECCO the smart option. To be
fair, however, you could go with other options such as…
· 
Instantaneous
“Tankless”/ “On-Demand” Water
Heater: $175 - $1200 for each water
fixture
·  Wi-Fi Enabled Heat Pump Water Heater:
$900 - $2500
·  Wi-Fi Enabled Conventional Storage Water
Heater: $500 -$900With the GECCO, you get the value of these three for only $75 during the campaign! 

Clearly, going these alternative routes will indeed achieve what the GECCO offers, but the cost is prohibitively expensive. These costs don’t include
shipping, installation and taxes.The three types of control valves that the GECCO fits look like this:                                  
This Campaign is About More Than just Water Heaters
There is a deeper dimension to
this campaign. While we are very excited about the benefits the GECCO has to offer society and the environment,
we are also focused on sending love to our Veterans. We are giving back to our
vets by donating 25% of ANNUAL
profits to a very worthwhile program:
The Veteran’s Transition Center of Monterey County is a powerful organization located on the historic
Fort Ord military base in Marina, California. Their mission is to help veterans
and their families adjust to normal life after they leave military service.
The VTC is responsible for providing housing
assistance, life skills courses, legal assistance and special events for veterans all throughout Monterey County.
Eventually we
want to give to many more veteran focused non-profits. And since our product will
be built here in the USA, our plan
is to employ as many veterans as
possible in the manufacturing, marketing, management, sales
and distribution of the GECCO.How Did We Get Here?""Over the past few years I became more and more aware of pollution and conservation of natural resources in our country. So in trying to do my share I would turn off my water heater when I was away from my house. It was a manual process, but worth doing. Several years ago, my wife and I went on a trip and, as always, turned off our water heater. The next morning, after returning back late, I heard some rough words coming from the bathroom where my wife was taking a shower!
I soon learned that I had forgot to turn the water heater back on the night before.  At that point I realized that I needed to develop a remote capability for my water heater. After some simple research I realized that we only needed hot water several hours a day. I did not leave my cars running all night  because we needed them the next day, why was my water heater keeping water hot 100% of the time when I only needed it 10% of the time. So over the last couple of years I have developed and built several prototypes and developed the one that finally meets all my needs. You can program it to go on and off when you need or do not need hot water. So no more cool showers for my wife! It has an on demand capability, so you can turn it on by just turning on the hot water anywhere in the house for a second. It runs on batteries, solar or household voltage. It can be controlled by any smart device and it can even detect a leak in your water heater. The latest prototype requires no tools and can be installed in less than a minute. I have named this unit the GECCO, Green, Energy, Efficient, Cost, Conservation, Optimizer.""Bo Hayner, Inventor of the GECCO     Testimonials

<h2>Superhero Polish</h2>
<p><i><strong>**DO NOT USE the polish on porous objects such as untreated marble, frosted chrome, unfinished wood etc..</strong></i></p>
<p>Now that the warning is out of the way...</p>
<p>Superhero Polish is a nontoxic environmentally safe finish restore polish that will leave everything once dull, all shiny and smooth.</p>
<p>When mixed with either water or olive oil it removes tarnish with very little effort, can polish water stains off of finished wood and can be used to polish pretty much anything with a gloss.  You'll even see your reflection after you're done!</p>
<p>Using the dry powder removes sticky or gunky spots in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p><strong>But I ALREADY Have A Polish!</strong></p>
<p>I am sure you do. But most store brand polishes are stinky and/or toxic. Not a lot of fun to use. Think of almost any silver tarnish remover... BLECH. </p>
<p>Superhero Polish has virtually no smell and is 100% toxin free. If you ate some the worst that would happen is you might get a bit healthier from the Magnesium Oxide ingredient. But it tastes like sand mixed with water, so eating it is not recommended.</p>
<p>It's made with very basic ingredients: Magnesium Oxide (as mentioned earlier) and very hard particles of Carbon, in nano and micron form, and very super fine diamond dust.</p>
<p>The teeny tiny particles are extremely dense because they are made through an explosive detonation synthesis process.  Super fine and super small and super hard means, well, Superhero Polish!</p>
<p><strong>What's That Mean To Me? </strong></p>
<p>It means a little goes a long way.  Because the particles ARE super-dense they are hardy and last a long time. Once the polish has soaked into your designated polishing cloth you can use that cloth over and over  - only rarely adding more polish. So, when we send you your 25 grams of Superhero Polish, it could literally last you a lifetime. It really depends on how gungy your stuff is and how much stuff you've got. </p>
<p><strong>How Do I Use It?</strong></p>
<p>The polish requires two dedicated cloths. One for polishing and one for burnishing. Even if you wash the cloths the polish will still be embedded in the material, so don't use any cloths that have personal meaning to you. Once you are done a polishing job, you can store your cloth for future use.</p>
<p>Dab the cloth in water or olive oil depending on what you are polishing.</p>
<p>Dab into the polish. Rub in small circles and coat the area.  The more you polish the smoother the result.</p>
<p>Take the burnishing cloth - the cloth with nothing on it - and burnish away the Superhero Polish.</p>
<p>Voila! It's as simple as that.</p>
<p><strong>Wait a Minute, You Said This Polish Is Environmentally Friendly. How Can That Be If You Use EXPLOSIVES to Make it?</strong></p>
<p>Because Superhero Polish is made with an environmentally safe explosive!  Inventor, Daren Swanson, patented a new explosive formula that produces LOADS of this polishing powder when it detonates.

**DO NOT USE the polish on porous objects such as untreated marble, frosted chrome, unfinished wood etc..
Now that the warning is out of the way...
Superhero Polish is a nontoxic environmentally safe finish restore polish that will leave everything once dull, all shiny and smooth.
When mixed with either water or olive oil it removes tarnish with very little effort, can polish water stains off of finished wood and can be used to polish pretty much anything with a gloss.  You'll even see your reflection after you're done!
Using the dry powder removes sticky or gunky spots in the blink of an eye.
But I ALREADY Have A Polish!
I am sure you do. But most store brand polishes are stinky and/or toxic. Not a lot of fun to use. Think of almost any silver tarnish remover... BLECH. 
Superhero Polish has virtually no smell and is 100% toxin free. If you ate some the worst that would happen is you might get a bit healthier from the Magnesium Oxide ingredient. But it tastes like sand mixed with water, so eating it is not recommended.
It's made with very basic ingredients: Magnesium Oxide (as mentioned earlier) and very hard particles of Carbon, in nano and micron form, and very super fine diamond dust.
The teeny tiny particles are extremely dense because they are made through an explosive detonation synthesis process.  Super fine and super small and super hard means, well, Superhero Polish!
What's That Mean To Me? 
It means a little goes a long way.  Because the particles ARE super-dense they are hardy and last a long time. Once the polish has soaked into your designated polishing cloth you can use that cloth over and over  - only rarely adding more polish. So, when we send you your 25 grams of Superhero Polish, it could literally last you a lifetime. It really depends on how gungy your stuff is and how much stuff you've got. 
How Do I Use It?
The polish requires two dedicated cloths. One for polishing and one for burnishing. Even if you wash the cloths the polish will still be embedded in the material, so don't use any cloths that have personal meaning to you. Once you are done a polishing job, you can store your cloth for future use.
Dab the cloth in water or olive oil depending on what you are polishing.
Dab into the polish. Rub in small circles and coat the area.  The more you polish the smoother the result.
Take the burnishing cloth - the cloth with nothing on it - and burnish away the Superhero Polish.
Voila! It's as simple as that.
Wait a Minute, You Said This Polish Is Environmentally Friendly. How Can That Be If You Use EXPLOSIVES to Make it?
Because Superhero Polish is made with an environmentally safe explosive!  Inventor, Daren Swanson, patented a new explosive formula that produces LOADS of this polishing powder when it detonates. The ingredients are simply frozen Carbon Dioxide and Magnesium. What comes out of the detonation is Nanodiamond, and Nano-Magnesium Oxide as well as larger micron stuff. Pure, simple and safe elements, uniquely combined into an ultra-fine powder.

<h3>About</h3>
<p>The history of wooden utensils is rooted in the distant past. Our ancestors carved many household items from wood - benches, tables, barrels, wooden spoons of different sizes and much more. At the beginning of the 20th century, the popularity of such dishes significantly decreased.But tired of everything artificial, the modern inhabitants of our planet crave environmentally friendly household goods, that is why we considering that projects can help people to choose more healthy and modern utensils at the same time. We all want to be healthy, to live in harmony with nature, so that household items will bring exclusively joy and health benefits, as well as will be environmentally friendly.</p>

<p> The table served by wooden utensils looks cosy and warm, what makes any modern kitchen interior irresistible.</p>

<h3>Introducing Avedo eco kitchen utensils</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568619105/rwi1yxak1feffvfd4zly.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>In addition to beauty and practicality, utensils have several advantages:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Environmental friendliness. People began to take care of their health more often and wooden kitchen appliances will help at that. You can be sure that in the composition of natural walnut wood, there are no harmful chemical compounds that destroy human body. The big benefit of wooden spoons is that even the smallest members of your family can use them, insofar as wood utensils are absolutely safe.</li>
<li>Healing properties. It is no secret that wood has healing properties. When heated, and even during normal use, wooden utensils release useful essential oils, that benefits our body.</li>
<li>Cooking food with wooden tools, help to save its natural flavour and food are enriched with useful enzymes by absorbing the woody aroma, it unleashes foods full flavour.</li>
<li>Strength. Wooden utensils are highly durable. If you drop a wooden tool on the floor, it will not crash or bend. Utensils are absolutely safe at high temperatures and in dishwashers.</li>
<li>Zero thermal conductivity. The wood does not conduct heat at all, which means that you can try your favourite dishes with such devices without bothering to get burned.</li>
<li>Safe to all dishes. The use of wooden tools completely eliminates damage to the non-stick coating in pans and pots. It is also very convenient to mix salads in glass bowls with wooden spoons with long handles. This method will not allow you to chop or scratch the walls of the salad bowl, and the dish looks very stylish in such a serving.</li>
<li>Good compatibility. Wood utensils go well with porcelain sets and glass dishes. The main thing here is to observe the unity of style.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Avedo eco design </h3>
<p>We have been investigated all types and styles of wooden utensils on the market, and it became clear why majority of people  prefer tools from artificial materials rather than natural. The main reason for this is small variety of wooden and natural tools, as well their similarity and nondescript old-fashioned look. Nobody wants to  ruin kitchen view and buy something what isn't harmonised to festive table.  </p>
<p>Thus, considering all mentioned factors, we decided to create something special, what will be absolutely natural, fashionable, durable and lovely.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568619364/qndekzmdcmmguxezitdh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>First sketches of Avedo eco utensils were drawn by hand and pencil, we tried to display as much as we could, how should durable and stylish kitchen utensils look like and which we would like to use ourselves on a daily basis. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568619387/igd0s3aohkyc9flee9ys.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Later on, considering all necessary preferences, utensils were redesigned in computer modulation. Avedo eco utensils turned out to be looking well. We believe that many housewives would like to have such an assistants along them at the kitchen everyday. </p>
<p>To create absolutely comfortable utensils for kitchen use, were taken into account all essential kitchen, dishes and human parameters. Accordingly Avedo eco kitchen utensils are in the following shapes and sizes: </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568619435/vzcyusmlnwmwr4z7xyt8.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We have already prototyped our Avedo eco utensils, but will continue our enhancement process over the next few weeks to get everything done right. That means there may be some slight changes on carving style or utensil sizes. But you don't have to worry about that, as soon as we will have any changes, we will keep you updated, so there are no surprises on a delivery day.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>The making of Avedo eco</h3>
<p><strong>Manufacturer</strong></p>
<p>To support local UK manufacturing, reduce time and expenses on project implementation and to control Avedo eco utensils production process, we have chosen small local wood manufacturer, which is located here in Greater Manchester.</p>
<p>By hearsay present manufacturer is famous for good and experienced work. He is specialized in producing small furniture for home such as tables, chairs, shelves and etc, thus we consider this as a good idea to cooperate with local wood masters with a good reputation. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568619907/nbzfjagnhq0bfvlmnsyv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Also one important aspect of choosing where Avedo eco utensils will be produced is production region. We would like to make it in Europe region, namely in England, what is enough valuable for customers worldwide. </p>
<p>Cooperation system already was agreed with manufacturer, was discussed what kind of raw material will be used, quantity and processing method. Manufacturer will consider all our requirements of item parameters and its features. As well based on our preferences and sketches we have developed trial prototype of 6 piece set.</p>
<p><strong>Material</strong></p>
<p>We want to make Avedo eco items entirely from environmental friendly material, what will be durable during many years and what will be absolutely harmless, we decided to use sustainable nutwood namely walnut wood. Walnut wood is considered as valuable material among all wood. Walnut has many benefits such as density, resiliency, durability, which help tools remain in the same original condition for a long time. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Funding and Fulfillment</h3> <p>Estimated target is 10.000£ due to the following costs for the project implementation:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568619958/qetvio7qtra31wljo5wt.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are raising the amount required for a minimum production of 300 units. This amount covers the cost of items manufacturing, material expenses, shipping costs and all required fees. </p>
<p>Worldwide shipping costs are already included into a pledge price, thus there will not be any extra fees.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Timeline </h3>
<p>We have ensured both our material suppliers and manufacturers are ready to go.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568621046/ewsojieldygjyipfwywj.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Our Story </h3>
<p>Hey Indiegogo, I am Anastasia cooking enthusiast and nature lover. I always try to use non-toxic, non-artificial, eco-friendly, natural products, because they are not harmful for the health, good for the nature and environment. That's why I recommend to use eco-friendly and safe household products.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1568620054/wwk3hjdzpzxyizywr0uf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>By developing eco-friendly wooden utensils for cooking, I tried to take into account all necessary factors for making it absolutely safe for human health and environment, as well as inalienable and beautiful part of kitchen interior. </p>
<p>Just a few decades ago my family inherited the remaining wooden appliances from our grandparents. That was really old dishes and utensils painted by Russian folk drawings, but after awhile my family decided to get rid of that old fashioned appliances and to replace it with new and modern items. </p>
<p>Due to its plain appearance, wooden dishes are considered as last century fashion, and because of it nobody wants to use it regardless of benefits and advantages comparing with new and modern inventions. Everybody wants to go with the times forgetting about own health and our planet, insofar as mostly behind new inventions stands chemicals, synthetics, non-recycling materials, what cause harm to our bodies and earth. Manufacturers have to reduce their costs, thus often produce low-quality, cheap, harmful products.</p>
<p>I would like to dispel myths, to combine advantages, safety and beauty at once, to give people opportunity enjoy old-fashioned items nowadays, by giving a chance and preferences to natural eco-friendly utensils.  Avedo eco items will decorate any modern kitchen interior, will benefit your health and environment, as well as it will create a cosy and warm atmosphere at any home.</p>
<p>After successful Indiegogo campaign I plan to bring Avedo eco products in UK market and later worldwide, as I am sure people will love them all around the world. </p> <h3>Thank you Indiegogo</h3>
<p>We appreciating your help and support, you help us to bring that wonderful project to life and we are excited to finish that project as soon as possible by making everyone's home and kitchen a little bit more eco-friendly and closer to nature.</p> <h3>Rewards</h3>

The history of wooden utensils is rooted in the distant past. Our ancestors carved many household items from wood - benches, tables, barrels, wooden spoons of different sizes and much more. At the beginning of the 20th century, the popularity of such dishes significantly decreased.But tired of everything artificial, the modern inhabitants of our planet crave environmentally friendly household goods, that is why we considering that projects can help people to choose more healthy and modern utensils at the same time. We all want to be healthy, to live in harmony with nature, so that household items will bring exclusively joy and health benefits, as well as will be environmentally friendly.

 The table served by wooden utensils looks cosy and warm, what makes any modern kitchen interior irresistible.

 
Introducing Avedo eco kitchen utensils

In addition to beauty and practicality, utensils have several advantages:

Environmental friendliness. People began to take care of their health more often and wooden kitchen appliances will help at that. You can be sure that in the composition of natural walnut wood, there are no harmful chemical compounds that destroy human body. The big benefit of wooden spoons is that even the smallest members of your family can use them, insofar as wood utensils are absolutely safe.
Healing properties. It is no secret that wood has healing properties. When heated, and even during normal use, wooden utensils release useful essential oils, that benefits our body.
Cooking food with wooden tools, help to save its natural flavour and food are enriched with useful enzymes by absorbing the woody aroma, it unleashes foods full flavour.
Strength. Wooden utensils are highly durable. If you drop a wooden tool on the floor, it will not crash or bend. Utensils are absolutely safe at high temperatures and in dishwashers.
Zero thermal conductivity. The wood does not conduct heat at all, which means that you can try your favourite dishes with such devices without bothering to get burned.
Safe to all dishes. The use of wooden tools completely eliminates damage to the non-stick coating in pans and pots. It is also very convenient to mix salads in glass bowls with wooden spoons with long handles. This method will not allow you to chop or scratch the walls of the salad bowl, and the dish looks very stylish in such a serving.
Good compatibility. Wood utensils go well with porcelain sets and glass dishes. The main thing here is to observe the unity of style.



 
Avedo eco design 
We have been investigated all types and styles of wooden utensils on the market, and it became clear why majority of people  prefer tools from artificial materials rather than natural. The main reason for this is small variety of wooden and natural tools, as well their similarity and nondescript old-fashioned look. Nobody wants to  ruin kitchen view and buy something what isn't harmonised to festive table.  
Thus, considering all mentioned factors, we decided to create something special, what will be absolutely natural, fashionable, durable and lovely.

First sketches of Avedo eco utensils were drawn by hand and pencil, we tried to display as much as we could, how should durable and stylish kitchen utensils look like and which we would like to use ourselves on a daily basis. 



Later on, considering all necessary preferences, utensils were redesigned in computer modulation. Avedo eco utensils turned out to be looking well. We believe that many housewives would like to have such an assistants along them at the kitchen everyday. 
To create absolutely comfortable utensils for kitchen use, were taken into account all essential kitchen, dishes and human parameters. Accordingly Avedo eco kitchen utensils are in the following shapes and sizes: 

We have already prototyped our Avedo eco utensils, but will continue our enhancement process over the next few weeks to get everything done right. That means there may be some slight changes on carving style or utensil sizes. But you don't have to worry about that, as soon as we will have any changes, we will keep you updated, so there are no surprises on a delivery day.

 
Features 
The set consists of the 6 most important appliances for preparing various daily dishes. Despite the use showed below, each device can be used at its discretion.
Mixing Spoon

This spoon is the smallest and most versatile, spoon is used in food preparation to measure, mix, stir and toss ingredients. Mixing spoon makes it easier to cook and prepare meals. Whether you need a tool to combine ingredients for cooking or baking, or need something to scrape the bottom of the sauce pan with after you prepare dinner, a mixing spoon is an essential tool at every kitchen.
 Serving Spoon

Serving spoon is used to serve or mix dishes. Generally it can be used together with Pasta/Salad fork.
Salad or Pasta Fork

Flat spatula

 A spatula is a hand-held tool that is used for lifting, flipping, or spreading. Spatulas have a handle that is long enough to keep the holder's hand away from what is being lifted or spread, as well as away from a hot surface. The blade of the spatula is wide and thin.

The making of Avedo eco
Manufacturer
To support local UK manufacturing, reduce time and expenses on project implementation and to control Avedo eco utensils production process, we have chosen small local wood manufacturer, which is located here in Greater Manchester.
By hearsay present manufacturer is famous for good and experienced work. He is specialized in producing small furniture for home such as tables, chairs, shelves and etc, thus we consider this as a good idea to cooperate with local wood masters with a good reputation. 

Also one important aspect of choosing where Avedo eco utensils will be produced is production region. We would like to make it in Europe region, namely in England, what is enough valuable for customers worldwide. 
Cooperation system already was agreed with manufacturer, was discussed what kind of raw material will be used, quantity and processing method. Manufacturer will consider all our requirements of item parameters and its features. As well based on our preferences and sketches we have developed trial prototype of 6 piece set.
Material
We want to make Avedo eco items entirely from environmental friendly material, what will be durable during many years and what will be absolutely harmless, we decided to use sustainable nutwood namely walnut wood. Walnut wood is considered as valuable material among all wood. Walnut has many benefits such as density, resiliency, durability, which help tools remain in the same original condition for a long time. 
 
Funding and Fulfillment Estimated target is 10.000£ due to the following costs for the project implementation:

We are raising the amount required for a minimum production of 300 units. This amount covers the cost of items manufacturing, material expenses, shipping costs and all required fees. 
Worldwide shipping costs are already included into a pledge price, thus there will not be any extra fees.
 
 
Timeline 
We have ensured both our material suppliers and manufacturers are ready to go.

Our Story 
Hey Indiegogo, I am Anastasia cooking enthusiast and nature lover. I always try to use non-toxic, non-artificial, eco-friendly, natural products, because they are not harmful for the health, good for the nature and environment. That's why I recommend to use eco-friendly and safe household products.

By developing eco-friendly wooden utensils for cooking, I tried to take into account all necessary factors for making it absolutely safe for human health and environment, as well as inalienable and beautiful part of kitchen interior. 
Just a few decades ago my family inherited the remaining wooden appliances from our grandparents. That was really old dishes and utensils painted by Russian folk drawings, but after awhile my family decided to get rid of that old fashioned appliances and to replace it with new and modern items. 
Due to its plain appearance, wooden dishes are considered as last century fashion, and because of it nobody wants to use it regardless of benefits and advantages comparing with new and modern inventions. Everybody wants to go with the times forgetting about own health and our planet, insofar as mostly behind new inventions stands chemicals, synthetics, non-recycling materials, what cause harm to our bodies and earth. Manufacturers have to reduce their costs, thus often produce low-quality, cheap, harmful products.
I would like to dispel myths, to combine advantages, safety and beauty at once, to give people opportunity enjoy old-fashioned items nowadays, by giving a chance and preferences to natural eco-friendly utensils.  Avedo eco items will decorate any modern kitchen interior, will benefit your health and environment, as well as it will create a cosy and warm atmosphere at any home.
After successful Indiegogo campaign I plan to bring Avedo eco products in UK market and later worldwide, as I am sure people will love them all around the world.  Thank you Indiegogo
We appreciating your help and support, you help us to bring that wonderful project to life and we are excited to finish that project as soon as possible by making everyone's home and kitchen a little bit more eco-friendly and closer to nature. Rewards
