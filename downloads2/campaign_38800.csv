<h3>Our Story  (Climate Change- From Sea Birds to Polar Bears)<br/>
</h3>The film follows the story of one man, one island and 40 years of dedication as he returns to the same Arctic outpost to study the area's wildlife. <br/><br/>As much of the Arctic is now ice free in the summer, what started out as a sea bird project has evolved. Cooper Island has now become a refuge for the Arctic's most charismatic inhabitant, the polar bear. As a consequence of this change, biologist Dr George Divoky's research has grown into a dramatic study of climate change in the polar regions. It is an indicator of the problems now facing the entire of the planet.<br/><br/>Much of the film is already shot and this campaign is being run to help fund the completion of the project through editing and the building of a website to host the film. It would be available free of charge and provide a great educational resource to anyone.<br/>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact  (Help spread the word)<br/>
</h3>Climate change is perhaps the biggest challenge facing our planet. Not only does it impact wildlife, but as weather becomes more extreme and unpredictable, it has already begun to have dramatic consequences for people across the world as devastating floods, drought, storms and wildfires become more common. It poses huge challenges for food production, safety and political instability.<br/><br/>Although scientists from around the world have strong evidence that the process is well underway and that we need to change our living habits to save the planet, there are many people that still don't understand what is happening to the world's climate. As a consequence they have not joined the movement for change. This compelling story is a great vehicle to help spread the word to a wider audience and to make people care enough to want to make a difference. <br/>
</div><div>
<h3>The Help We Need<br/>
</h3>The film's producers, biologist George Divoky, Friends of Cooper Island and others that have assisted by providing over $30,000 in production costs and enabled the team to already shoot most of the film. We need your help to complete the editing and delivery of the project.<br/><br/>We are hoping to raise a minimum of $8,000 to finish the film and present it on its own website. Our donors will recieve a range of perks from a DVD of the film to being able to spend time with the filmmaker (David Wright) in Maine to discuss the project and have a personalized day of tuition in documentary film making.<br/><br/>David is an award winning documentary filmmaker specializing in 
wildlife and environmental stories. He has particular interest in the 
Arctic and is responsible for producing the Emmy awards winning National
 Geographic film ""Realm of the Great White Bear"", following the first 
year of life of a polar bear.  He first met George Divoky while shooting
 a story for the new BBC / Discovery series 'Frozen Planet'. <br/>

<br/>White Horse Mountain is a 1,700 acre forested mountain in Hampshire County, WV. It is the last remnant of what was once tens of thousands of acres of former timber company land - much of it public access. These timber lands have been systematically sold off as residential subdivisions, degrading the local character, wildlife habitat and water quality of this rural region. White Horse was also purchased by a developer but the housing crash has forced them to place the property back on the market, providing us a rare opportunity to protect this land and return it to public access - forever.<br/> <br/><p>Potomac Conservancy has negotiated an option to purchase the mountain but we must raise more than $3 million to make it happen. If we are able to exercise our option by the end of March, we can purchase the property and transfer it to the WV Division of Natural Resources (DNR) to become the State's newest public Wildlife Management Area. This land, rather than divided into 70 residential lots as proposed by the current owner, will instead be opened to the public for hunting, hiking, wildlife viewing and other enjoyment. </p>

for a loan to finance the remainder. We have a goal of bringing at least $600,000 in cash to the April, 2015 closing - 94% of which we have already secured. You can help us raise the remaining $35,000 to take us across the finish line. We are also pleased to say that a local family foundation matched the first $20,000 of donations dollar for dollar AND another generous supporter pledged an additional $4,000 challenge on April 13. <span style="""">  </span></p>

Any funds raised beyond the immediate cash-in-hand goal of $35,000 additional dollars will go directly toward filling the remaining $350,000 funding gap (dark blue above).

White Horse Mountain is a 1,700 acre forested mountain in Hampshire County, WV. It is the last remnant of what was once tens of thousands of acres of former timber company land - much of it public access. These timber lands have been systematically sold off as residential subdivisions, degrading the local character, wildlife habitat and water quality of this rural region. White Horse was also purchased by a developer but the housing crash has forced them to place the property back on the market, providing us a rare opportunity to protect this land and return it to public access - forever. Potomac Conservancy has negotiated an option to purchase the mountain but we must raise more than $3 million to make it happen. If we are able to exercise our option by the end of March, we can purchase the property and transfer it to the WV Division of Natural Resources (DNR) to become the State's newest public Wildlife Management Area. This land, rather than divided into 70 residential lots as proposed by the current owner, will instead be opened to the public for hunting, hiking, wildlife viewing and other enjoyment. 
         Their Plan - Private Subdivision          Our Plan - Public Conservation Land

   What We Need & What You Get We have already raised more than half of the needed funds to purchase the land and have arranged 
for a loan to finance the remainder. We have a goal of bringing at least $600,000 in cash to the April, 2015 closing - 94% of which we have already secured. You can help us raise the remaining $35,000 to take us across the finish line. We are also pleased to say that a local family foundation matched the first $20,000 of donations dollar for dollar AND another generous supporter pledged an additional $4,000 challenge on April 13.   

White Horse Mountain Fundraising To-Date ($3.2M goal)


Any funds raised beyond the immediate cash-in-hand goal of $35,000 additional dollars will go directly toward filling the remaining $350,000 funding gap (dark blue above). We don't need these 'extra' funds to close - that's what the loan is for! But they will allow us to take a smaller loan and help ensure that we can quickly transfer the property to the DNR and get it into your hands to enjoy.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Tony Croasdale and I am the program coordinator for the Cobbs Creek Junior Docent Program. This program is training seven inner-city Philadelphia high school students to serve as naturalists and tour guides for the park. Cobbs Creek Park is a beautiful forested stream corridor in economically depressed West Philadelphia. Of the city's two other stream corridor parks (the major parks of the city) this is the only one without a city funded environmental center, and coincidentally the park surrounded by the lowest income neighborhoods of the three parks. Cobbs Creek Community Environmental Education Center is a non-profit organization founded to fill that void. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Currently Cobbs Creek Environmental Center has several programs that provide supplementary environmental education to hundreds of Philadelphia students. What the center is lacking is a way to provide ongoing public programs. The Junior Docent program is a way to provide the public with a free and fun environmental education experience while giving these high school students valuable work experience. <br/><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Currently the program is funded through May 31st and the stipends to pay the students for their guide services in earmarked for the summer, however after May 31st there are no funds to pay for personnel to open and staff  the center and supervise the students and ensure their safety while conducting the tours. Also, there is currently no funding to promote this program. The Junior docents have been training since November and while they will receive their training stipends it looks like they may not be actually get to be paid to lead the tours they worked so hard to prepare for. This program provides an invaluable resource to the community. On our first public nature walk in November 28 people attended!  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise $5,000 to pay for staff to keep the environmental center open to the public and to supervise the docents during June, July and August. This will be a salary of $15.00 per hour for ten hours a week. The balance will be to pay for promotional materials, add space and binoculars. For a small amount of money dozens of people a week from a low income neighborhood will receive free guided nature walks in a beautiful park. This will enable these high school students who have worked so hard during training to demonstrate their skills to the public and gain valuable paid work experience. <br/></p>

<p>Before we tell you more, we'd like to talk about why we're doing this campaign and why it's such a critical time for shark conservataion. </p>
<h3>Sharks in Danger</h3>
<p>Sharks have roamed our planet’s oceans for almost 450 million years ago, yet today these perfect predators are in extreme peril. Each year, up to 73 million sharks are killed to support the global shark fin soup industry. Many shark populations have suffered declines of up to 90% in only a few decades. The effects of this decline are far reaching. Sharks are key top predators that regulate the structure and function of marine ecosystems: their disappearance threatens the health of the whole ocean. </p>
<p>However, as awareness of the threats to these magnificent creatures increases, the tides are starting to shift. The next critical moment is fast approaching and will be the first global campaign for Shark Stanley. In March 2013, 176 countries will convene in Bangkok for the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (<a href=""www.cites.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CITES</a>) meeting. Three endangered sharks, including the iconic hammerhead and two manta rays species are proposed for protection. We are going to make sure that CITES reps vote YES!  </p>
<p>Using viral social media, our goal is to partner with 50 organizations, aquariums and NGOs internationally to gather at least 5000 photos from 176 countries. We'll compile these an give them directly to those responsible for voting in each country as creative petition ""signature,"" showing them that there are thousands of passionate supporters, in their country and globally, that demand shark protection!</p>
<p>The campaign won't stop there. Shark Stanley will not only continue to advocate on the global stage, but will provide a charismatic character that young people can build their own relationship with while making meaningful links with youth around the world as they share their own Shark Stanley adventures.</p>
<p>With that, we invite you to join us: <strong>Shark Stanley Needs Your Help!</strong></p>

We'll compile these an give them directly to those responsible for voting in each country as creative petition ""signature,"" showing them that there are thousands of passionate supporters, in their country and globally, that demand shark protection!
The campaign won't stop there. Shark Stanley will not only continue to advocate on the global stage, but will provide a charismatic character that young people can build their own relationship with while making meaningful links with youth around the world as they share their own Shark Stanley adventures.
With that, we invite you to join us: Shark Stanley Needs Your Help!

Leah Meth with Shark Stanley 


What We Need
We need $10000 for our project:
$3000 - Honorarium for the talented Daniel Yagmin Jr. who is doing the watercolor illustrations for the book and the cut-out characters 
$3000 - For the graphic design and printing of the Book
$3200 - To run the symposium, bring in our fantastic guest speakers and professionally film the talks and distribute them globally
$500 - To run the children's events, covering printed materials, crafts, life size Shark Stanley cut-outs and shark artifact displays
$300 - To design, create and deliver the photo ""petitions"" to all 176 CITES representatives; press release in Bangkok at CITES which Leah and Onon will be attending.


Other Ways You Can Help


Even if you can't contribute funding, there are still ways that everyone can help Shark Stanley:


You can send us your photo with him and get your friends and family to do the same!

<p><strong>We are concerned with climate change and the impacts it is already having on communities in the South Pacific. Over the last ten years strong ties have been made with government, non-governmental and community groups in Vanuatu and awareness has been raised on the issues of coastal erosion and sea level rise. Communities have been displaced in Vanuatu owing to changes in the coastal zone. Through a strong and committed team of concerned people in Vanuatu, New Zealand and the Philippines a coastal adaptation plan has been put into place. One of the key elements in the plan is rehabilitation of the coastal vegetation zone through the planting of native coastal plant species that are known to be saltwater tolerant and sand binding.</strong></p>
<p><strong>One of the key plant species that has been lost to the system is <em>Spinfex littoreus. </em>It needs to be returned to the islands so that the people of Vanuatu can have the best possible chance to support their own drive toward coastal zone stability in the face of rising seas.</strong></p>
<p><strong>With your support a team from Vanuatu, New Zealand and the Philippines with expertise in plant ecology, coastal rehabilitation and climate change will secure <em>Spinifex littoreus</em> seeds in the Philippines and bring them to Vanuatu for propagation and dissemination to threatened coastal communities. They are ready to protect their coastlines using vegetative means. The technology is well advanced and proven with kilometres of coastline protected in New Zealand and elsewhere around the world through community inititiaves. The Government of Vanuatu is strongly committed to the process and will support the nurseries and community groups for implementation. They just need the seed to start.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your contribution will support an international team in traveling to source seed in the Philippines through a relationship with the University of the Philippines-Los Banos. The members of the team have worked together on numerous climate change risk assessment projects and have known each other for many years. They are a committed team of practical ecologists, scientists and community organisers.</strong></p>
<p><strong>When completed this project has the potential to revolutionise and rapidly accelerate coastal adaptation activities across the Pacific. As is well known, this region is already experiencing the impacts of climate change. Through the reintroduction of a critical coastal plant species to Vanuatu the country is keen to become the model for other Pacific nations and the community-based teacher and provider of plant material for those nations.</strong></p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p><strong>We need your contribution to support the time and travel for the team to source seed from <em>native Spinifex littoreus</em> plants still found in the Philippines. The experts from the University of Los Banos will assist the team from New Zealand who will process the seed and carry it back to Vanuatu where it will be turned over to the Vanuatu Department of Forestry for propagation. All government processes and procedures will be met for the export/import of biological material. As the plant variety is native to the region there is no biosecurity risk.</strong></p>
<p><strong>If the funding goal is not met all funds will support nursery development in Vanuatu for the propagation of other native plants for environmental rehabilitation. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your contribution and the successful implementation of this reintroduction of <em>Spinifex littoreus</em> will have an enormous impact on mitigating coastal erosion not only in the Vanuatu but in other nations of the region. Not only will coastal environments be better protected but the surrounding reef systems will have less stress and be more resilient to climate change owing to the control of coastal erosion that has been impacting negatively.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our team has the experience in such work with hundreds of kilometers of coastal environments having been rehabilitated with native species in New Zealand. With strong community support beaches have grown in size and have become highly resistant to storm  damage. In fact, storms have aided in the growth of the once highly eroded dune system. The key team member Mr. Greg Jenks is a leader in his field and he has also travelled to Vanuatu to advise on opportunities for extending the methods. The other team member Dr. Peter Urich has over 20 years experience in community environmental projects and has been involved in climate change risk assessments and adaptation planning in Vanuatu for many years. Peter also has extensive experience in the Philippines where he conducted socio-environmental research for his master and PhD. His links and strong working relationship with the Chancellor of the University of Philippines – Los Banos and the Dean of the School of Forestry means that the country’s best people will be involved. In Vanuatu Dr. Chris Bartlett formerly of GIZ and now affiliated with the Government of Vanuatu and a speaker of ni-Vanuatu will coordinate with the various government departments who will manage the propagation and dissemination of the resulting plants.

<p>My name’s Kate, and I spent the past couple of years building my own permaculture farm from scratch. I started out with a 3 acre plot of woods, and through natural building techniques, grafting native trees into more productive fruit trees, cover cropping, and using animal rotations, built a productive and sustainable small farm. Before that, I spent years interning with the most innovative, creative and knowledgable people I could find all around the country. I have had the pleasure of working with those on the cutting edge of sustainable farming. That experience taught me a lot, but I realized that one of the things I loved most was teaching other people the skills I have learned.  And now, I’m looking to take the knowledge and resources I’ve gained, and try to make it accessible for more people, in the form of a farm that is also a community center. With your help, I am trying to buy the perfect farm to do this with.</p>
<p>What are you trying to do?</p>
<p>Specifically, things that will be demonstrated/taught on the farm:</p>
<ul>
<li>Home Solar Power (both passive and active, including passive solar house design)</li>
<li>Grafting/budding fruit and nut trees (and grafting native trees into more productive trees)</li>
<li>Plant Propagation</li>
<li>The Integrated Orchard (growing trees, animals, and mushrooms in concert organically)</li>
<li>Permaculture Design classes (and other sustainable land use classes)</li>
<li>Horsepower on the Farm (using horses for mowing, driving, hauling, etc)</li>
<li>Artisan Cheesemaking (and how to start a home dairy)</li>
<li>In addition to on-farm demos, I intend to have speakers come give classes on other sustainable topics</li>
</ul><p> </p>
<p>Many of these skills are dying arts (such as grafting, horsepower, and cheesemaking) while others are just emerging (solar technology and permaculture design). It is my belief that taking the “good” from the past and the “good” from the present and combining them can help create a sustainable and beautiful future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Where will the farm be? What will you grow?</p>
<p>The farm will be in upstate South Carolina, which has a wonderful climate for growing a huge array of productive crops. It also has a great social climate, with both Greenville, SC and Asheville, NC having a broad base of communities interested in sustainable living. Geographically, it is easily reached from GA, NC, TN, and lowcountry SC, which makes it a nice “hub” for drawing folks here.</p>
<p>As far as what will be grown for food crops, one can expect the following (grown organically and biodynamically, meaning no chemical sprays):</p>
<p>Indian Runner Ducks, Dairy Sheep (St. Croix), Guineas, Turkeys, Mules, Oyster mushrooms, Apples, Pears, Mulberries, Kiwis, Jujube, Figs, Kumquats and other hardy citrus, Gooseberry, Medlar, Almond, Peach,  Pecans, Asian persimmon, American Persimmon, Butternut, Shagbark Hickory, Persian Walnut, Blackberries, Raspberries, Pawpaws, Plums, Loquat, Hazelnuts, Elderberry, and various annual crops including rye and wheat grain.</p>
<p>What will this money do?</p>
<p>The funds will go to paying for the land, as it is by far the biggest expense. I am able to propagate most of the plants, and cover the cost of building structures and earthworks (ponds, swales, berms, etc) but gathering funds for 10 acres has been challenging. In addition, I want this farm to be more of a community educational center, and less of a “private farm”, so asking for funding from the public makes sense.</p>

<h2>""What's on Your Sleeve?""</h2>
<h3><strong>OUR PROJECT</strong></h3>
<p>Out of a simple design improvement a product is born, in  this case, the next evolution of beverage sleeves. To date, coffee sellers  supply a disposable one time use cardboard sleeve as a courtesy for the  customer. On each is a printed company logo for branding purposes and/or other  advertisements. Unfortunately, this creates tons of extra waste in the world’s  landfills. Our products, which we refer to as “Green Sleeves”, are  easy-grip beverage sleeves that can be used over and over.</p>
<p>With this innovation, our product can be sold directly to  those very coffee houses AND retailers on a wholesale level. This will help  reduce and eliminate the daily waste of the 50 Billion cardboard sleeves disposed of annually around  the world while becoming a point of revenue for retailers. </p>
<p>In essence we are creating a fun and useful product while  designing a print-on-demand business model for online customers. </p>
<p>At Planet Green Sleeves, action, purpose and a cause to  reduce the billions of wasteful corrugated cardboard sleeves is what drives us  to bring an exciting and sustainable product to the world!
  Since our product involves the  sharing of ideas from others around the world we thought why not let our  backers give it a name and logo, the one/s that best represents the products  image and message will be chosen at the end of the campaign and be rewarded at  the $500.00 level. We look forward to seeing your great ideas!</p>

<p><strong>What is Planet Green Sleeves? </strong>Our mission is to  promote environmental consciousness through the use and sale of reusable  beverage sleeves fashioned in an ergonomically designed sense made with green  technology and or recyclable products. <strong> </strong></p>
<p>Planet  Green Sleeves will carry a full line of reusable sleeves that is safer for hot  and cold liquids. Its ergonomic shape fits perfectly into the hand of the end  user. The sleeve keeps the temperature comfortable for holding, thereby preventing  potentially harmful incidents and providing a long needed improvement of corrugated  cardboard sleeves in use today.  </p>
<p>It helps protect the  environment and people love because of its eco-friendliness and its endless  personalized customization possibilities. Every individual can express their  unique personalities by simply uploading an image on our consumer website for  print and delivery. What’s going to be on your sleeve?</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How did you come up with such a great idea? </strong>The inspiration for Planet  Green Sleeve’s first came to me from the repeated annoyance of getting coffee  cups from the local barista that were too hot to handle even with a corrugated  cardboard sleeve. I would find myself using additional cardboard sleeves along  with paper napkins to cool down my cup, simply put… wastefulness in its truest  form. I decided to create my own solution and the idea for Planet Green Sleeves  was born.</p>
<p><strong>What's so cool and unique about it?</strong><br/>
Good  question! </p>
<p>Here is why we think Planet  Green Sleeve’s is so special: It possesses the following qualities<strong>… extremely light, US Manufactured,  Customizable, Heat/Cold Stable, Superior Strength and Performance.</strong></p>
<p><img alt=""Green Sleeve Renders with Corporate Logos"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.planetgreensleeves.com/cfund/Image0003.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>First considered were the 4 questions below</strong><br/><strong>1. Do you have an idea, innovation or invention?</strong><br/><strong>2. Do you think it has commercial value?</strong><br/><strong>3. Can it be made, marketed and sold at a profit?</strong><br/><strong>4. Do you want to get it into the  center of its marketplace so it can serve humankind and make you money?</strong></p>
<p>Stats are relevant and warrant consideration for any  products success so here’s a few eye popping mind boggling figures for you to  digest. Initially we are targeting an industry that has the distinction of  being the number one consumed beverage on the planet. There are 400 Billion  cups consumed annually worldwide, wherein 50 Billion are takeaway cups (with cardboard  sleeves on them).</p>
<p>We’re # 1!  The US population consumes about 400 Million cups of coffee per day or  equivalent to 146 Billion cups per year making the United States the world’s  largest coffee consumer, 54% of the population of the US drinks coffee daily  spending an approximated 9.2 Billion dollars in the retail sector. </p>
<p>Studies  reveal the average consumer holds on to their cup for 49 minutes. The message  on the sleeve is seen by six people and the retention rate of the information  on the sleeve is 65%, business owners are sure to choose this form of  advertising over disposable sleeves thus by default contributing towards  sustainability.</p>
<p><strong>It's truly Reusable.</strong> We engineered it to last for <em>thousands</em> of uses.  It is made from a sturdy substrate that is pliable, malleable, bendy and soft  to the touch, not a dry chalky cardboard associated with the cardboard sleeves.  It folds into a carry pouch for easy storage and transport too.</p>

<p><strong>Could the saying…”Good advertising dollars gone to waste” be more  literal?</strong> One  company alone in the United States prints over 200 Million corrugated cardboard  sleeves with advertising/logo designs. Sadly, those cardboard sleeves help generate 45 million pounds of  landfill waste. That's enough sleeves to circle the Earth 18 times! If  by developing a simple product that can help prevent the untold daily waste of <strong>hundreds</strong> <strong>of  millions</strong> of corrugated cardboard sleeves, would it be worth further  efforts to bring to the market? Even if Planet Green Sleeves products can  replace 1% of the world’s cardboard sleeve waste, that is still <strong>45,000 pounds </strong>of waste kept out of the landfills.</p>

<p><strong>Creation  of a product that stimulates awareness on a global scale. </strong>In truth, it is long  overdue for not only a design improvement but an engineering innovation towards  comfort and functionality that surpasses its predecessor. Our projected retail  price point under $10.00 and wholesale pricing much less will not challenge  consumers buying decisions, and will lead them to (“go green”). This will  foster a sense of contribution without having to purchase large ticket items  such as solar panels or hybrid automobiles. </p>
<p><strong>It's  sustainable. </strong>To us, sustainable  means a responsible product that actually reduces your “carbon foot print” on  the planet. Planet Green Sleeve’s products will last you for thousands of uses.  We are committed to being eco-friendly!</p>
<p><strong>Proudly  Made in the USA!</strong> After extensive  research and many bids from overseas manufacturers we turned to the USA and  found a reputable manufacturing company right here in Denver Colorado. They are  committed to bringing this eco-friendly product to the masses.</p>

<p><strong>What  happens if the Planet Green Sleeves project is over-funded? </strong>By all accounts an additional  $50,000.00 above our target goal of $7,500.00 would expedite the creation on  our full line of products. With more, we can also turn our attention towards  immediately instituting the print on demand digital image transferring for  personal customizing. The initial $7,500.00 will take us in the direction to  build the prototype and build the business in a manner that will allow us to do a first run of manufacturing  and introduce Green Sleeves to over 30,000 distributor chains. Exceeding our  funding goal will only help us to grow stronger and faster. Don't worry, we  will consistently keep you updated and informed on our progress!

<h3><strong><em><u>Join the conspiracy and be a steward of the Earth!</u></em></strong></h3></div>","PLANET GREEN SLEEVES
""What's on Your Sleeve?""
OUR PROJECT
Out of a simple design improvement a product is born, in  this case, the next evolution of beverage sleeves. To date, coffee sellers  supply a disposable one time use cardboard sleeve as a courtesy for the  customer. On each is a printed company logo for branding purposes and/or other  advertisements. Unfortunately, this creates tons of extra waste in the world’s  landfills. Our products, which we refer to as “Green Sleeves”, are  easy-grip beverage sleeves that can be used over and over.
With this innovation, our product can be sold directly to  those very coffee houses AND retailers on a wholesale level. This will help  reduce and eliminate the daily waste of the 50 Billion cardboard sleeves disposed of annually around  the world while becoming a point of revenue for retailers. 
In essence we are creating a fun and useful product while  designing a print-on-demand business model for online customers. 
At Planet Green Sleeves, action, purpose and a cause to  reduce the billions of wasteful corrugated cardboard sleeves is what drives us  to bring an exciting and sustainable product to the world!
  Since our product involves the  sharing of ideas from others around the world we thought why not let our  backers give it a name and logo, the one/s that best represents the products  image and message will be chosen at the end of the campaign and be rewarded at  the $500.00 level. We look forward to seeing your great ideas!

What is Planet Green Sleeves? Our mission is to  promote environmental consciousness through the use and sale of reusable  beverage sleeves fashioned in an ergonomically designed sense made with green  technology and or recyclable products.  
Planet  Green Sleeves will carry a full line of reusable sleeves that is safer for hot  and cold liquids. Its ergonomic shape fits perfectly into the hand of the end  user. The sleeve keeps the temperature comfortable for holding, thereby preventing  potentially harmful incidents and providing a long needed improvement of corrugated  cardboard sleeves in use today.  
It helps protect the  environment and people love because of its eco-friendliness and its endless  personalized customization possibilities. Every individual can express their  unique personalities by simply uploading an image on our consumer website for  print and delivery. What’s going to be on your sleeve?
 
How did you come up with such a great idea? The inspiration for Planet  Green Sleeve’s first came to me from the repeated annoyance of getting coffee  cups from the local barista that were too hot to handle even with a corrugated  cardboard sleeve. I would find myself using additional cardboard sleeves along  with paper napkins to cool down my cup, simply put… wastefulness in its truest  form. I decided to create my own solution and the idea for Planet Green Sleeves  was born.
What's so cool and unique about it?
Good  question! 
Here is why we think Planet  Green Sleeve’s is so special: It possesses the following qualities… extremely light, US Manufactured,  Customizable, Heat/Cold Stable, Superior Strength and Performance.

First considered were the 4 questions below1. Do you have an idea, innovation or invention?2. Do you think it has commercial value?3. Can it be made, marketed and sold at a profit?4. Do you want to get it into the  center of its marketplace so it can serve humankind and make you money?
Stats are relevant and warrant consideration for any  products success so here’s a few eye popping mind boggling figures for you to  digest. Initially we are targeting an industry that has the distinction of  being the number one consumed beverage on the planet. There are 400 Billion  cups consumed annually worldwide, wherein 50 Billion are takeaway cups (with cardboard  sleeves on them).
We’re # 1!  The US population consumes about 400 Million cups of coffee per day or  equivalent to 146 Billion cups per year making the United States the world’s  largest coffee consumer, 54% of the population of the US drinks coffee daily  spending an approximated 9.2 Billion dollars in the retail sector. 
Studies  reveal the average consumer holds on to their cup for 49 minutes. The message  on the sleeve is seen by six people and the retention rate of the information  on the sleeve is 65%, business owners are sure to choose this form of  advertising over disposable sleeves thus by default contributing towards  sustainability.
It's truly Reusable. We engineered it to last for thousands of uses.  It is made from a sturdy substrate that is pliable, malleable, bendy and soft  to the touch, not a dry chalky cardboard associated with the cardboard sleeves.  It folds into a carry pouch for easy storage and transport too.

Could the saying…”Good advertising dollars gone to waste” be more  literal? One  company alone in the United States prints over 200 Million corrugated cardboard  sleeves with advertising/logo designs. Sadly, those cardboard sleeves help generate 45 million pounds of  landfill waste. That's enough sleeves to circle the Earth 18 times! If  by developing a simple product that can help prevent the untold daily waste of hundreds of  millions of corrugated cardboard sleeves, would it be worth further  efforts to bring to the market?

 the non-profit organizing the Climate Stick project with 350.org (getting 20%)

have no ""official"" connection with them.<br/><br/><h3>The Impact  

</h3><p>(A personal message from the developer of the Climate Stick for Climate Action project)</p>
<p>Many people are very worried about how fast our climate
is changing and how soon these changes will dramatically affect our ability to
feed the 7 billion plus people who now inhabit the Earth (not to mention
increasingly severe floods, fires, storms and other major climate related
events we see weekly now on our TV screens).</p>
<p>But conversation about these issues is so filled with
half-truths and competing technologies that as yet we have not been able to
create a consensus with the political will to overcome the strength of the
fossil fuel industry and its supporters.</p>
<p>I have been giving presentations about climate change for
more than six years, and have engineering,  educational and business
experience in changing how organizations function. The facts and focus of the climate debate have changed over time but it is
still difficult to convey quickly and clearly what is at a stake as we burn
more carbon.  Ten weeks ago I discovered
a way to make the complete picture clearer with a simple picture – the Climate
Stick as I call it. In my last
presentations many people “got it” in ways they had not before.  </p>
<p>The Climate Stick for Climate Action project is an attempt
to bring the use of the Climate Stick to the national conversation of how we
turn the corner and start to directly address the climate crisis. We all know
that a mass movement is needed to free up the money that subsidizes coal and
oil so that the green energy sources (including energy conservation and
efficiency) we need can be brought to implementation a lot sooner that the year
2050 that is given lip service in current debate.</p>
<p>The Climate Stick for Climate Action will bring 20,000
(40,000 if we significantly overachieve our fundraising goal of $22,000)
Climate Stick Pendants to the Peoples Climate March on September 21 in New York
City to be distributed at no cost by a Street Team of 30-40 people engaging
marchers in Manhattan.  Our web-site
(cs4us.org) will allow for additional Climate Stick Items
to be available to support the building of a mass movement to stop the burning
of fossil fuel by 2022.  Yes, a goal all
reasonable people think is just impossible. A mass movement could change that.
More on this in the Risks &amp; Challenges section.</p>
<p>Our video shows you the Climate Stick and how you can
use it in your discussions. <br/></p><p>Our Perks will let you get Climate Stick 
related
educational, clothing and jewelry that also convey the story of the 
Climate
Stick.  You are also making a symbol for the
mass movement to stop burning carbon as you support the Climate Stick

Climate Action project and use the items you receive as Perks to inform 
your
relatives, co-workers and friends.</p><p> Bill
McKibben has said “Very few people on earth ever get to say: ""I am

This statement directs what I do in my life.  Living it produced the 
Climate Stick.  If you think the Climate Stick would help you

carbon,
then Bill might just be right.</p><br/><h3>What you get</h3>First, a tool to help you communicate the issues of the climate debate clearly and powerfully.
<p>Second, a connection to the movement that will ban the burning of

<b>Additional Details of the Project</b>
<p>The Basic Story: Green,
Black, Yellow, and Red</p>
<p>After 60 plus presentations
about climate change that included up to 50 slides, and taking 40 minutes, I
have reduced the story about climate change to a two minute discussion with the
Climate Stick as my visual aid.</p>
<p>My hope is that each person
masters the short version and uses it to expand the number of people who will
help us get to a sane energy policy.</p>
<p><u>The Green</u></p>
<p>The green represents the last
11,000 years up to 1804 CE (estimated date of reaching one billion people on
the planet).<span>  It is the time when humans
developed agriculture and during that time the CO2 in the atmosphere was about
275ppm and the average earth temperature was about 55 °F.  The total CO2 in the atmosphere was about
2300 Gigatons.  The greenhouse effect
from the CO2 was beneficial.  It helped
keep the climate consistent enough for us to develop agriculture in many places
on the globe, and allowed for the human population to grow to 1 billion people.</span></p>
<p>The beginning of the
Industrial Age starts sometime after 1750 CE and between then and 1850 CE there
was little addition of CO2 by humans to the atmosphere.<span>  Choosing 1804 when the population was
estimated to reach one billion is a convenient, but arbitrary, date for the
change from Green to Black.</span></p>
<p><u>The Black</u></p>
<p>The black represents the
additional CO2 in the atmosphere that has mostly been added by humans burning
coal, oil and natural gas.<span>  What began
with the steam engine has continued until 2011 with the result of having 396ppm
of CO2 in the atmosphere which added an additional 1,852 Gigatons of CO2.  The average Earth temperature increased 1.5
°F because of this increase in CO2 and in methane which comes from increased milk
and meat production.</span></p>
<p>Within the Black section is a
Yellow Stripe showing when the CO2 in the air reached 350ppm – the amount that
is believed to be the maximum amount of CO2 that can exist in the atmosphere
without beginning to change the general climate patterns of the last 11,000
years.<span>  This level was passed in 1988.
And since then in ever increasing ways the climate has started to change,
causing more and stronger floods, droughts and more destructive hurricanes. And
of course: expanding oceans, melting Greenland and Antarctic ice and increasing
ocean, land and air temperatures.</span></p>
<p>For discussion purposes the
line between the Black and Yellow band represents now (2014) and the current
level of CO2 is about 400ppm.<span>  You can
use the Climate Stick from the Yellow through the Red to represent the future
and the Green and the Black represent the past.</span></p>
<p><u></u></p>
<p><u>The Yellow</u></p>
<p>The Yellow represents the
estimated amount of 565 Gigatons of additional CO2 that can be placed in the
atmosphere before causing the surface temperature to increase by 3.6°F.<span>  At this temperature much of agriculture will
be disrupted by changes in the climate and the minimum need for food to feed
the 7-9 Billion people on the planet will not be met.  As we move forward in time more people will
have a harder time getting the food they need to sustain themselves.  Some scientists believe that we have 15 years
before major food shortages occur; others think that 30 to 40 years is left
before the 3.5°F limit is reached.  The
Yellow represents both the additional CO2 that can be added before major
disruptions of the food growing capacity occur, and at the same time it
represents 25% of the total amount of fossil fuel that the fossil fuel industry
has on its books to burn by 2050.</span></p>
<p><u>The Red</u></p>
<p>The large oil and coal
companies and the petro/fossil fuel states such as Saudi Arabian, Russia, USA
and Venezuela have $28 Trillion worth of carbon in the ground that they intend
to burn by 2050.<span>  Only $7 Trillion of
that can be burned without the temperature exceeding a 3.6°F increase.  The Red section is three times as large as
the Yellow section.</span></p>
<p><b>So what</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Noted scientists and
activists, like James Hansen, Bill McKibben and others have written books,
hundreds of articles and made thousands of presentations.<span>  They are so fearful of the future their
grandchildren will inherit that they have been arrested multiple times at the
White House to bring attention to the climate crises.  What will you do <b>now</b> to help eliminate the BURNING OF CARBON FOR ENERGY?</span></p>
<p>Background: How the Climate Stick Came to
Be</p>
<p>By
late April 2014 I had given 50 to 60 presentations on climate change.  I
had developed or borrowed close to seventy slides that illustrated the science,
economics and politics of the ""climate crisis.""  I was invited
to give a presentation to a student group at a church in Essexville, Michigan
on April 27th, 2014.  As I prepared for the presentation, I decided to
simplify certain slides by representing several concepts and values on a
2"" x 2"" piece of lumber that was 5 feet long.  The information
was written with black marker in sections marked off with green tape.  The
presentation was given and those present seemed to like the ""climate
stick.""<br/><br/>
The next week as I prepared for a presentation at the Bay County Commission
(BCC)<span>  on 5/13/2014, I revised the data
on the original climate stick and decided to use color and a full 2"" x
4"" piece of wood six feet in length.  As I was making these changes,
it occurred to me that smaller versions of the colored climate stick could be
used in informal situations to make discussion about climate change more
understanding and vivid.  I made several smaller versions about 18” long
(with my nephew B.J. Race doing the painting) and took three climate sticks to
the Lone Tree Council meeting on May 2, 2014.  After my presentation, one
of the members made a donation to obtain one of the climate sticks.<br/><br/>
I took the six foot long, color climate stick to the BCC meeting on May 13th,
2014.  After about a six minute presentation that was videotaped by a
community access TV station, several commissioners asked questions and the
taped session was about 8 minutes long. 
When I put the video on my Facebook page I received many positive
comments and five or six people shared it with others.</span></p>
<p>As
I used the shorter version of the stick at several events leading up to our May
17, 2014 350 Picture event, it seemed just a little too long - so I drilled a
hole in one end and hung it with a cord around my neck to keep my hands
free.<span>  I used the six foot version at the
May 17, 2014 event and more than twenty people made it a point to tell me how
effective the Climate Stick was.  Several
of them said that they would like a smaller version for their own use in
discussion with friends.  As I thought
about making it shorter the idea of making if a pendant to wear around the neck
came into my mind and I asked a clay artist to see if he could make a pendant
using the colors of the Climate Stick. 
We produced four different sizes and the 2” long version was the
preference of 90% of the women who made up the rolling “focus group”.  Using clay was a time consuming effort. I had to look for a way to mass produce the
Climate Stick so that it was economically feasible to provide them to many
people. The pendant in its mass produced form is a variation on the tags which
are used for security and identification on more expensive clothing and jewelry
items.</span></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>There are three significant problems that can make the
realization of the Climate Stick Pendants  project difficult: </p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>production of the Climate Stick pendants</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>assemble and management of the distribution team,
and </p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>logistics of getting the Climate Stick pendants to the
distribution team.</p>
<p>In addition there is a set of very unlikely possibilities
that could affect the “special event” that is one of the main elements of the
project.  Should the Peoples Climate
March in New York be postponed, cancelled or disrupted then the main
distribution activity needed could be diminished significantly.  Since these possibilities would most likely
happen only a day or two before the event, the only plan possible is to regroup
and choose another event to distribute the Climate Stick pendants.</p>
<p>Possible Solutions to Risks and Challenges</p>
<p>Production of the Climate Stick Pendants</p>
<p>Production is currently scheduled for the supplier to
deliver the Climate Stick Pendants on September 12, 2014.  The supplier has a strong record of on-time
delivery.  Weekly checking of the
delivery schedule is planned for each week until delivery.</p>
<p>Assemble and management of the distribution team</p>
<p>The estimated is that 40 people are needed to distribute 20,000
climate sticks in 6 hours. And provide and explain the climate stick. They will
be the Climate Stick Street team. The Street Team is to be made of two
organizations that will provide the majority of the needed volunteers.</p>
<p>Logistics to New York City</p>
<p>Multiple hotel rooms have been reserved for the four days
before the September 21 event and the shipments of the Climate Stick pendants to the hotel should
be no problem. Getting the Climate Stick pendants to the Street Team in New York will require
coordination.</p>
<p>Another risk associated with the use of the Climate Stick is that it is not a precise instrument.  People will say ""about"" and ""almost"" when talking about the science and economics it helps them discuss.  This gives those who hold the view that only the most pristine science could ever influence them to accept that the status quo needs to change.  Most regular people get it, so don't worry about those who don't.  There are enough of us if we just get into organized action. And if we do then the actual state of what our scientist and engineers know and can invent will change the perception and reality of how fast we can eliminate the burning of carbon.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>You can make your own Climate stick with a piece of wood and colored markers in 5 minutes. Using what is in the Extras and the video, you could be doing a Climate Stick presentation in an hour.  So do it, and help your audience  go to Indiegogo and help support this project.</p>
<p>If you live in the New York City area, here are two ideas we would like to implement as Perks.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Meet the Climate Stick organizers in a 2 hour small party in
an apartment that has a view of NYC.<span> 
$400 donation for you and a friend to attend.  10 possible slots. This could be Friday, September
19 or 20 at 6, 7, 8 or 9PM.</span></p>
<p>Meet the Climate Stick organizers on a 2 Hour boat trip on
the Hudson River viewing the Manhattan Skyline.<span> 
$600 donation for you and a friend. 
5 possible slots.  This could be
Friday, September 19 or 20 anytime in the 2PM to 8PM time period.</span></p>
<p><span>If you know someone who is interested in the Climate Change movement and has either of these assets, ask them about the possibility, and if they say ""possible"", go to <a href=""http://www.cs4us.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.cs4us.org</a> and sign in with your phone or e-mail and I will contact you to see how we might approach them.<br/></span></p>And Of Course<ul>

(A personal message from the developer of the Climate Stick for Climate Action project)
Many people are very worried about how fast our climate
is changing and how soon these changes will dramatically affect our ability to
feed the 7 billion plus people who now inhabit the Earth (not to mention
increasingly severe floods, fires, storms and other major climate related
events we see weekly now on our TV screens).
But conversation about these issues is so filled with
half-truths and competing technologies that as yet we have not been able to
create a consensus with the political will to overcome the strength of the
fossil fuel industry and its supporters.
I have been giving presentations about climate change for
more than six years, and have engineering,  educational and business
experience in changing how organizations function. The facts and focus of the climate debate have changed over time but it is

Additional Details of the Project
The Basic Story: Green,
Black, Yellow, and Red
After 60 plus presentations
about climate change that included up to 50 slides, and taking 40 minutes, I
have reduced the story about climate change to a two minute discussion with the
Climate Stick as my visual aid.
My hope is that each person
masters the short version and uses it to expand the number of people who will
help us get to a sane energy policy.
The Green
The green represents the last
11,000 years up to 1804 CE (estimated date of reaching one billion people on
the planet).  It is the time when humans
developed agriculture and during that time the CO2 in the atmosphere was about
275ppm and the average earth temperature was about 55 °F.  The total CO2 in the atmosphere was about
2300 Gigatons.  The greenhouse effect
from the CO2 was beneficial.  It helped
keep the climate consistent enough for us to develop agriculture in many places
on the globe, and allowed for the human population to grow to 1 billion people.
The beginning of the
Industrial Age starts sometime after 1750 CE and between then and 1850 CE there
was little addition of CO2 by humans to the atmosphere.  Choosing 1804 when the population was
estimated to reach one billion is a convenient, but arbitrary, date for the
change from Green to Black.
The Black
The black represents the
additional CO2 in the atmosphere that has mostly been added by humans burning
coal, oil and natural gas.  What began
with the steam engine has continued until 2011 with the result of having 396ppm
of CO2 in the atmosphere which added an additional 1,852 Gigatons of CO2.  The average Earth temperature increased 1.5
°F because of this increase in CO2 and in methane which comes from increased milk
and meat production.
Within the Black section is a
Yellow Stripe showing when the CO2 in the air reached 350ppm – the amount that
is believed to be the maximum amount of CO2 that can exist in the atmosphere
without beginning to change the general climate patterns of the last 11,000
years.  This level was passed in 1988.
And since then in ever increasing ways the climate has started to change,
causing more and stronger floods, droughts and more destructive hurricanes. And
of course: expanding oceans, melting Greenland and Antarctic ice and increasing
ocean, land and air temperatures.
For discussion purposes the
line between the Black and Yellow band represents now (2014) and the current
level of CO2 is about 400ppm.  You can
use the Climate Stick from the Yellow through the Red to represent the future
and the Green and the Black represent the past.

The Yellow
The Yellow represents the
estimated amount of 565 Gigatons of additional CO2 that can be placed in the
atmosphere before causing the surface temperature to increase by 3.6°F.  At this temperature much of agriculture will
be disrupted by changes in the climate and the minimum need for food to feed
the 7-9 Billion people on the planet will not be met.  As we move forward in time more people will
have a harder time getting the food they need to sustain themselves.  Some scientists believe that we have 15 years
before major food shortages occur; others think that 30 to 40 years is left
before the 3.5°F limit is reached.  The
Yellow represents both the additional CO2 that can be added before major
disruptions of the food growing capacity occur, and at the same time it
represents 25% of the total amount of fossil fuel that the fossil fuel industry
has on its books to burn by 2050.
The Red
The large oil and coal
companies and the petro/fossil fuel states such as Saudi Arabian, Russia, USA
and Venezuela have $28 Trillion worth of carbon in the ground that they intend
to burn by 2050.  Only $7 Trillion of
that can be burned without the temperature exceeding a 3.6°F increase.  The Red section is three times as large as
the Yellow section.
So what

Noted scientists and
activists, like James Hansen, Bill McKibben and others have written books,
hundreds of articles and made thousands of presentations.  They are so fearful of the future their
grandchildren will inherit that they have been arrested multiple times at the
White House to bring attention to the climate crises.  What will you do now to help eliminate the BURNING OF CARBON FOR ENERGY?
Background: How the Climate Stick Came to
Be
By
late April 2014 I had given 50 to 60 presentations on climate change.  I
had developed or borrowed close to seventy slides that illustrated the science,
economics and politics of the ""climate crisis.""  I was invited
to give a presentation to a student group at a church in Essexville, Michigan
on April 27th, 2014.  As I prepared for the presentation, I decided to
simplify certain slides by representing several concepts and values on a
2"" x 2"" piece of lumber that was 5 feet long.  The information
was written with black marker in sections marked off with green tape.  The
presentation was given and those present seemed to like the ""climate
stick.""
The next week as I prepared for a presentation at the Bay County Commission
(BCC)  on 5/13/2014, I revised the data
on the original climate stick and decided to use color and a full 2"" x
4"" piece of wood six feet in length.  As I was making these changes,
it occurred to me that smaller versions of the colored climate stick could be
used in informal situations to make discussion about climate change more
understanding and vivid.  I made several smaller versions about 18” long
(with my nephew B.J. Race doing the painting) and took three climate sticks to
the Lone Tree Council meeting on May 2, 2014.  After my presentation, one
of the members made a donation to obtain one of the climate sticks.
I took the six foot long, color climate stick to the BCC meeting on May 13th,
2014.  After about a six minute presentation that was videotaped by a
community access TV station, several commissioners asked questions and the
taped session was about 8 minutes long. 
When I put the video on my Facebook page I received many positive
comments and five or six people shared it with others.
As
I used the shorter version of the stick at several events leading up to our May
17, 2014 350 Picture event, it seemed just a little too long - so I drilled a
hole in one end and hung it with a cord around my neck to keep my hands
free.  I used the six foot version at the
May 17, 2014 event and more than twenty people made it a point to tell me how
effective the Climate Stick was.  Several
of them said that they would like a smaller version for their own use in
discussion with friends.  As I thought
about making it shorter the idea of making if a pendant to wear around the neck
came into my mind and I asked a clay artist to see if he could make a pendant
using the colors of the Climate Stick. 
We produced four different sizes and the 2” long version was the
preference of 90% of the women who made up the rolling “focus group”.  Using clay was a time consuming effort. I had to look for a way to mass produce the
Climate Stick so that it was economically feasible to provide them to many
people. The pendant in its mass produced form is a variation on the tags which
are used for security and identification on more expensive clothing and jewelry
items.

  Risks & Challenges  
Risks and challenges
There are three significant problems that can make the
realization of the Climate Stick Pendants  project difficult: 
· 
production of the Climate Stick pendants
· 
assemble and management of the distribution team,
and 
· 
logistics of getting the Climate Stick pendants to the
distribution team.
In addition there is a set of very unlikely possibilities
that could affect the “special event” that is one of the main elements of the
project.  Should the Peoples Climate
March in New York be postponed, cancelled or disrupted then the main
distribution activity needed could be diminished significantly.  Since these possibilities would most likely
happen only a day or two before the event, the only plan possible is to regroup
and choose another event to distribute the Climate Stick pendants.
Possible Solutions to Risks and Challenges
Production of the Climate Stick Pendants
Production is currently scheduled for the supplier to
deliver the Climate Stick Pendants on September 12, 2014.  The supplier has a strong record of on-time
delivery.  Weekly checking of the
delivery schedule is planned for each week until delivery.
Assemble and management of the distribution team
The estimated is that 40 people are needed to distribute 20,000
climate sticks in 6 hours. And provide and explain the climate stick. They will
be the Climate Stick Street team. The Street Team is to be made of two
organizations that will provide the majority of the needed volunteers.
Logistics to New York City
Multiple hotel rooms have been reserved for the four days
before the September 21 event and the shipments of the Climate Stick pendants to the hotel should
be no problem. Getting the Climate Stick pendants to the Street Team in New York will require
coordination.
Another risk associated with the use of the Climate Stick is that it is not a precise instrument.  People will say ""about"" and ""almost"" when talking about the science and economics it helps them discuss.  This gives those who hold the view that only the most pristine science could ever influence them to accept that the status quo needs to change.  Most regular people get it, so don't worry about those who don't.  There are enough of us if we just get into organized action. And if we do then the actual state of what our scientist and engineers know and can invent will change the perception and reality of how fast we can eliminate the burning of carbon.

Other Ways You Can Help You can make your own Climate stick with a piece of wood and colored markers in 5 minutes. Using what is in the Extras and the video, you could be doing a Climate Stick presentation in an hour.  So do it, and help your audience  go to Indiegogo and help support this project.
If you live in the New York City area, here are two ideas we would like to implement as Perks.


Meet the Climate Stick organizers in a 2 hour small party in
an apartment that has a view of NYC. 
$400 donation for you and a friend to attend.  10 possible slots. This could be Friday, September
19 or 20 at 6, 7, 8 or 9PM.
Meet the Climate Stick organizers on a 2 Hour boat trip on
the Hudson River viewing the Manhattan Skyline. 
$600 donation for you and a friend. 
5 possible slots.  This could be
Friday, September 19 or 20 anytime in the 2PM to 8PM time period.
If you know someone who is interested in the Climate Change movement and has either of these assets, ask them about the possibility, and if they say ""possible"", go to www.cs4us.org and sign in with your phone or e-mail and I will contact you to see how we might approach them.And Of Course
Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!

<p style=""margin-top: .1pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: .1pt; margin-left: 0in;"">We are the Everitts (Anthony and Kriscinda). We were married about a year ago and shortly afterwards, we found the perfect house/property to start our lives together. We moved from the city to a rural area with the hopes of living a slower-paced life, closer to the land, more self-sufficiently, and with the ability to pretty much do what we want (and neither of us are unreasonable people). Since moving here (really, since the weather got nice), we've put most of our energy into constructing a 23-raised-bed vegetable garden. It was a tremendous amount of work, but as of this writing, things are growing! We plan on canning and freezing enough to take us through the winter.</p>
<p style=""margin-top: .1pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: .1pt; margin-left: 0in;"">Unfortunately, our neighbors don't share our enthusiasm, or our aesthetic, despite the fact that this land and this property in particular has been used for farming since the late 1700s.

<p style=""margin-top: .1pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: .1pt; margin-left: 0in;"">The short version is that one neighbor in particular has tried passive-aggressiveness, intimidating us via the mail, and now he's dragging us before the township Board of Supervisors in order to force us to maintain <em><span style=""font-family: Times;"">our</span></em> property the way <em><span style=""font-family: Times;"">he</span></em> wants to see it, which is a little like a golf course (with a barn on it).</p>

<p style=""margin-top: .1pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: .1pt; margin-left: 0in;"">We're fighting this. We'll fight it with the township and if that doesn't succeed, we'll get a lawyer. The fact is that we didn't spend most of our savings just to act as caretakers for a pretty suburban parkland for our neighbors to admire. We bought this place in order to make it functional and to please us in terms of <em><span style=""font-family: Times;"">our</span></em> aesthetic. There's a lot at stake here, including whether or not we stay or sell, which would be devastating for us. We're also afraid that fighting this is going to rapidly deplete the remainder of our savings, and this leaves little room to take this measure...</p>

We'd need a solid fence between our house and his house, because he's also a bit of a peeping Tom. But he's not the only neighbor who has issues with us (for the same reasons, though), and so we'd like to put a fence up along the rest of that side of our property as well. We're thinking a cheaper wire fence on which we could grow thick vines. We have a total of 5.38 acres, with a total of about 1,175 feet we'd like to fence in, 3'-8' in height, in accordance with township ordinances. $10,000 won't even touch all of that, but if we could get the solid fence up between us and our most immediate problem, that would be a <em><span style=""font-family: Times;"">huge</span></em> relief and then we could see what we could do about the rest of it on our own.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
We are the Everitts (Anthony and Kriscinda). We were married about a year ago and shortly afterwards, we found the perfect house/property to start our lives together. We moved from the city to a rural area with the hopes of living a slower-paced life, closer to the land, more self-sufficiently, and with the ability to pretty much do what we want (and neither of us are unreasonable people). Since moving here (really, since the weather got nice), we've put most of our energy into constructing a 23-raised-bed vegetable garden. It was a tremendous amount of work, but as of this writing, things are growing! We plan on canning and freezing enough to take us through the winter.
Unfortunately, our neighbors don't share our enthusiasm, or our aesthetic, despite the fact that this land and this property in particular has been used for farming since the late 1700s. Around us is a little rural suburbia. It's too much to get into here, but it you'd like the ugly details of what we've been dealing with, please get yourself a cup of coffee and click this link:
 
http://heavymetalhomesteading.wordpress.com/2013/06/25/us-and-our-neighbors/
 
The short version is that one neighbor in particular has tried passive-aggressiveness, intimidating us via the mail, and now he's dragging us before the township Board of Supervisors in order to force us to maintain our property the way he wants to see it, which is a little like a golf course (with a barn on it).
 
We're fighting this. We'll fight it with the township and if that doesn't succeed, we'll get a lawyer. The fact is that we didn't spend most of our savings just to act as caretakers for a pretty suburban parkland for our neighbors to admire. We bought this place in order to make it functional and to please us in terms of our aesthetic. There's a lot at stake here, including whether or not we stay or sell, which would be devastating for us. We're also afraid that fighting this is going to rapidly deplete the remainder of our savings, and this leaves little room to take this measure...
 
...in order to preserve our sanity, we would like to build a fence. We'd need a solid fence between our house and his house, because he's also a bit of a peeping Tom. But he's not the only neighbor who has issues with us (for the same reasons, though), and so we'd like to put a fence up along the rest of that side of our property as well. We're thinking a cheaper wire fence on which we could grow thick vines. We have a total of 5.38 acres, with a total of about 1,175 feet we'd like to fence in, 3'-8' in height, in accordance with township ordinances. $10,000 won't even touch all of that, but if we could get the solid fence up between us and our most immediate problem, that would be a huge relief and then we could see what we could do about the rest of it on our own.


What We Need & What You Get
$10,000 will cover the solid fence in the most needed section, and its installation. It's amazing how expensive this stuff is. If there is anything left over from what we've raised, it will go towards more fencing, extending it further along the property line.
 
What will you get in return? First and foremost, you'll get the satisfaction that you're helping a couple of pretty decent folk make a complete jerk extremely unhappy. You'll also make those two people extremely happy by finally being able to walk out of their house without feeling harassed.
 
You'll also get things! Thanks to the generous donations of friends and family, you could receive a monster bunny, a conpany logo design, and more! I myself (Kriscinda) will be happy to make a lovely, warm afghan throw in the colors of your chosing! We'll keep adding perks as we find them...
Most importantly, you will get the satisfaction that you are helping irritate some folks who don't know how to mind their own #$%^&* business.
 
If we don't reach $10,000, whatever money we can raise will still go to the cost of the fence. Any help is help we need.


Other Ways You Can Help
If you cannot contribute financially to this campaign, please share it in any way you can. The more eyeballs that see it, the closer we will be to living with a little peace here. We think---we certainly hope---that in the end, we'll prevail, even if it means bringing them into court and citing the Constitution. In the meantime (and forever, really), we'd like to at least not have to watch them, watching us, and waiting for them to pick apart the next thing they become fixated on...",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><b><br/>The Problem...</b></h3>
<p>Some of the main causes of tropical forest loss and fragmentation include clearing areas of forest to make way for crops, roads and human settlements, all driven by a growing human population. In Uganda, this rate of forest loss is alarming, leaving the chimpanzees (as well as all the other species!) that live in the now-cleared forest exposed to these human activities and potentially prone to local extinction. The situation is urgent to find ways for humans and chimpanzees to coexist peacefully and to protect them in the long-term. </p>

LE PROJET :
Développer un procédé qui va dans le sens du Développement Durable, un procédé qui profitera à tous et fournira au marché un produit utile. Comme cela a été souvent exposé, la « guerre de l’eau » a commencé. L’avenir, c’est aujourd’hui et nous nous devons d’en faire quelque chose de bien. Chacun, à sa façon, a le devoir d’y participer.
 
COMMENT REALISER CE PROJET
Prouver le concept - Cela a été fait par le programme R&D qui a été appliqué ces 6 dernières années
Des spécifications techniques de conception, et plans de fabrication,  ont été réalisés pour des unités de taille diverses
Identifier le Marché : de nombreux contacts nationaux et internationaux ont exprimé  leur intérêt pour le produit
La conception a été améliorée au cours de la R&D. Il s’agit maintenant d’obtenir le capital nécessaire à la fabrication de plusieurs unités de démonstration et à leur implantation sur site dans diverses régions du Monde.
Nous avons les clients potentiels, un prototype fonctionnel qui nous a permis de produire 720 Litres/jour en France
Il nous reste maintenant à produire les unités de démonstrations qui reprennent l’ensemble des conclusions de nos études.

Le « capital » nécessaire afin de poursuivre le développement de ce projet est de 200 000 € qui seront utilisés selon tableau ci-après. Des clients potentiels ont demandé qu’une unité de démonstration soit présentée avant de passer des commandes fermes et/ou d’acheter des licences.

Since its monumental launch, Bamboo Skateboards has grown in recognition and popularity and is found online, as well as in skate shops across the country and around the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Our vision is to inspire others to take an active interest and responsibility in helping others and our environment with the goal of leaving the planet better than we found it."" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i1303.photobucket.com/albums/ag143/Jacquelyn219/ourvision_zpsf1e30790.png"" src="""" style="""" title=""Vision""/></p>

<p>Fundamental to Bamboo Skateboards are two principal factors: <strong>Sustainability</strong> and <strong>Philanthropy</strong>.</p>
<p>With an estimated <strong>6+ million skateboards produced annually</strong>, this industry has now become one of the <strong>leading causes of maple deforestation</strong> throughout the world. By using bamboo - which is a grass, not wood - as an alternative material for producing skateboards, we will be able to help preserve our forests, reduce soil erosion, and improve the air &amp; water quality of our planet.</p>
<p>Philanthropy is at the forefront for Bamboo Skateboards. We partner with many charities and non-profit organizations that benefit from every sale we make.  <b>Grind for Life, Red Cross, World Wildlife Fund and Musicares</b> are just a few of our alliances. In 2012, Bamboo Skateboards also launched an in-house charitable program known as <strong><em>""100 decks for 1""</em></strong> through which a portion of deck sales are given back to local at-risk youth in the form of complete skateboards. Can you imagine the difference a free skateboard could make for a child who is unable to afford one?</p>

<p></p></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div>","Bamboo Skateboards, located in Oceanside, CA, is an eco-friendly skateboard brand and manufacturer of high quality skateboards and longboards made of sustainable bamboo from managed forests. In 2008 a team of skaters and entrepreneurs decided to accept the challenge of coming up with an environmentally-friendly alternative to maple decks that they could introduce into the short board market; a feat that was virtually untouched at the time. Since its monumental launch, Bamboo Skateboards has grown in recognition and popularity and is found online, as well as in skate shops across the country and around the world.
 


 
Fundamental to Bamboo Skateboards are two principal factors: Sustainability and Philanthropy.
With an estimated 6+ million skateboards produced annually, this industry has now become one of the leading causes of maple deforestation throughout the world. By using bamboo - which is a grass, not wood - as an alternative material for producing skateboards, we will be able to help preserve our forests, reduce soil erosion, and improve the air & water quality of our planet.
Philanthropy is at the forefront for Bamboo Skateboards. We partner with many charities and non-profit organizations that benefit from every sale we make.  Grind for Life, Red Cross, World Wildlife Fund and Musicares are just a few of our alliances. In 2012, Bamboo Skateboards also launched an in-house charitable program known as ""100 decks for 1"" through which a portion of deck sales are given back to local at-risk youth in the form of complete skateboards. Can you imagine the difference a free skateboard could make for a child who is unable to afford one?




By contributing to our campaign, you will help a small company with a unique product and powerful message compete with highly established pro skateboard brands. This funding will allow us to raise awareness about global deforestation, expand our eco-friendly product line and become a force in the industry. Everyone loves the underdog!

In this first round of funding, we need $15,000. This money will help us raise awareness of global deforestation and the growing environmental issues caused by skateboard manufacturing, expand our eco-friendly product line and ultimately evolve the skateboard industry. $15,000 will allow us to purchase approximately 2 months of traditional advertising in the major skate magazines such as Transworld.  This will allow approximately 100,000 new skateboarders to learn about our company.  We have worked tirelessly to come up with a brilliant marketing campaign, and it is time we unleashed it!

<h3>THE PROJECT</h3>
<p>Henry David Thoreau is going off the grid once again, 168 years after his famous experiment in living deliberately in a simple cabin at Walden Pond! Thoreau Farm needs $25,000 to fund a solar photovoltaic system for the birthplace of Henry David Thoreau, America’s first and most influential environmentalist.<br/></p>

In 2010, we opened this important landmark to the public for the first time in its history. Today the house is visited from people from around the globe who are inspired by Thoreau’s timeless ideas on life, nature, and civic responsibility.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p><b><i>“What is the use of a house if
you haven't got a tolerable planet to put it on?”</i> <i>Henry David Thoreau</i></b></p></span><p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p>In honor of Thoreau's standing as father of the environmental movement and in the spirit of living deliberately, the Thoreau Farm Trust carefully integrated “green” materials and technology into the restoration of Thoreau’s birthplace while carefully maintaining the historic integrity of the building. We now have one final project…</p>
<p></p>
<p><b><i>“No sun illuminates me.”</i> <i>Henry David Thoreau</i></b></p>
<p></p>
<p>Our dream is to install a solar photovoltaic system at Thoreau’s birthplace and produce our own electricity. The system has been already been specced out and approved by the organization's Board of Directors. Preliminary permissions have been obtained from all relevant parties for the system's installation. Thoreau Farm has experience managing a capital project such as this, having successfully raised $900,000 and overseen significant work to the site already. We just need the funding to move it forward!<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>We urgently need your help to accomplish this goal! We need to raise $25,000 in the next 30 days to have the system installed by the end of the year because:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We want to have the system up and running before another cold New England winter when we rack up a majority of our electric use</span></li>
<li><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Rebates and credits for solar energy will be considerably less favorable in 2014</span></li>
</ul>
<p></p>You can help us reach our goal - and get cool perks! Please take a look at the giving levels to the right and make your gift today!<p></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><b><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">THE IMPACT</span><br/></b></p>
<p></p></span><p></p>
<p>The solar pv system will have the following impact on our organization:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i>Economic</i></b><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""> - by being able to generate our electricity we will save $2,000-$3,000 in operating costs per year.</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i><b>Environmental</b></i></span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b> </b>- we will no longer have to use electricity generated from non-renewable sources (we use a low temp heat pump for climate control, which needs electricity to operate so a solar pv system will enable us to be completely non-dependent on any fossil fuels, even for our heating and cooling needs).</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><i><b>Education</b></i> - we use all the green features at Thoreau's birthplace to educate visitors on how we can all be more environmentally conscious.</span><br/>

Today the house is visited from people from around the globe who are inspired by Thoreau’s timeless ideas on life, nature, and civic responsibility.

“What is the use of a house if
you haven't got a tolerable planet to put it on?” Henry David Thoreau

In honor of Thoreau's standing as father of the environmental movement and in the spirit of living deliberately, the Thoreau Farm Trust carefully integrated “green” materials and technology into the restoration of Thoreau’s birthplace while carefully maintaining the historic integrity of the building. We now have one final project…

“No sun illuminates me.” Henry David Thoreau

Our dream is to install a solar photovoltaic system at Thoreau’s birthplace and produce our own electricity. The system has been already been specced out and approved by the organization's Board of Directors. Preliminary permissions have been obtained from all relevant parties for the system's installation. Thoreau Farm has experience managing a capital project such as this, having successfully raised $900,000 and overseen significant work to the site already. We just need the funding to move it forward!

We urgently need your help to accomplish this goal! We need to raise $25,000 in the next 30 days to have the system installed by the end of the year because:


We want to have the system up and running before another cold New England winter when we rack up a majority of our electric use
Rebates and credits for solar energy will be considerably less favorable in 2014

You can help us reach our goal - and get cool perks! Please take a look at the giving levels to the right and make your gift today!

THE IMPACT

The solar pv system will have the following impact on our organization:



Economic - by being able to generate our electricity we will save $2,000-$3,000 in operating costs per year.


Environmental - we will no longer have to use electricity generated from non-renewable sources (we use a low temp heat pump for climate control, which needs electricity to operate so a solar pv system will enable us to be completely non-dependent on any fossil fuels, even for our heating and cooling needs).


Education - we use all the green features at Thoreau's birthplace to educate visitors on how we can all be more environmentally conscious.





You Can Help
A donation of any amount is welcome, and all donations make a difference. Take a look to the right for the unique perks we're offering. Whether you make a donation or not, please spread the word by sharing this campaign with your friends and contacts.

I am an avid science fiction reader since I was in primary school. When I was young I saw sci-fi as a window onto new, wonderful worlds. I gravitated to economics as a way to understand human societies, and figure out pathways to get from the world we have to some of those SF worlds: better, fairer, more humane ones.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571394514/bfspfr0p2dpocrcxe8z2.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>I am part of <strong><a href=""https://edgeryders.eu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Edgeryders</a></strong>. We are a global community and a post-capitalist enterprise trying to build the infrastructure for a more humane, fairer, greener society. We came together as we figured out that the society we have is badly broken, and that no help is coming.</p><p><strong>So, we started trying out new ways.</strong></p><p>In our <a href=""https://youtu.be/ABPNRbeQtd4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>unMonastery</strong></a> prototype we drew inspiration from 10th-century monks for serving local communities… </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571394533/um8hqmbp2rniexosdkov.png"" src=""""/></p><p>…and our experimental approaches to co-living and co-working are modelled on coral reefs (<a href=""https://edgeryders.eu/t/6239"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>The Reef</strong></a>).</p><p>Our past and ongoing experiments are connecting different paths into a shared collective journey. It is leading us through everything from experimenting with off-grid living, radical transparency, community driven - solutions for health and social care to street protests and institutional lobbying. Everything, everywhere at the same time.</p><p><strong>We want to build a new society, because we see that the house is on fire.</strong></p><p>But no society can work without an economy to support it. Economists would, in principle, be the right people to assist us in designing new economic models to support new kinds of society. They did it, in the past. Famous economists like Marx and Keynes dominated the academic debate, and visionary entrepreneurs and politicians like Charles Fourier, Robert Owen and Adriano Olivetti attempted to turn their ideas into viable businesses and policies, sometimes with spectacular successes.</p><p>But in recent times <strong>economics has let us down</strong>. Economists have major influence, but they use it to recommend preserving the status quo, with a few minor tweaks. They are not thinking about radical, system-level reorganizations, that could potentially preserve the planet’s ecological balance, and include everyone in a meaningful effort to be a successful, fair civilization.</p><p>But that work is necessary. Someone has to do it. So, it falls to us.</p><p>We are not alone in this.

 What if the future of economics is invented in science fiction?To discover it, participate in the first Sci-Fi Economics Lab, which will be held on 11 November 2019 in Brussels and on the internet (livestreaming)!The situation is clear. An economy’s inaction based on its certainties is creating a global deadlock. Permanent micro-adjustments are no longer enough. Fortunately, intellectuals on all sides reject the status quo and imagine more desirable futures. Among them, science fiction authors are now proposing radically new models and shaking up the established order.To highlight the synergies between SF and the economy, the Edgeryders community supported by EIT Climate-KIC is organising a major day of debates, workshops and celebrations open to all.
Take part in a large workshop. (14h30 - 16h30) Extinction Rebellion is joining forces with the Sci-Fi Economics Lab to discuss and create positive progress.
Discuss with figures from SF and the economy. (18h - 20h) Science fiction author Cory Doctorow, economist Tom Bauler, and the CEO of EIT Climate-KIC Kirsten Dunlop discuss how sci-fi and economics can give revamp our ability to rethink our economy.
Meet with academics to brainstorm topics for academic articles to be published in 2020 (next day at the Solvay Brussels School of Economics & Management.
By contributing to this crowdfunding campaign you do two things:

Make the Science Fiction Economics Lab possible - We need your support to help cover the costs of organising this year’s edition. If we do manage to meet the crowdfunding goal, then we can continue doing this work and organize more SciFI Econ activities with you.

Show us, and the world, that you support this effort - If the Sci-Fi Economics Lab is successful, its impact would show in directly influencing the political agenda, at least in Europe. Please do not pass on this opportunity. We may never get another.
What do you get if you contribute to the campaign?5 € or More - {OUR GRATITUDE} Thank you for coming on board and showing us your support.

Ethical + sustainable production (sourced locally). Hoodie will be available for you to pick up at the venue. If you cannot make it in person let us know which address to ship it to. Where does this come from?My name is Alberto Cottica. I am an avid science fiction reader since I was in primary school. When I was young I saw sci-fi as a window onto new, wonderful worlds. I gravitated to economics as a way to understand human societies, and figure out pathways to get from the world we have to some of those SF worlds: better, fairer, more humane ones.I am part of Edgeryders. We are a global community and a post-capitalist enterprise trying to build the infrastructure for a more humane, fairer, greener society. We came together as we figured out that the society we have is badly broken, and that no help is coming.So, we started trying out new ways.In our unMonastery prototype we drew inspiration from 10th-century monks for serving local communities… …and our experimental approaches to co-living and co-working are modelled on coral reefs (The Reef).Our past and ongoing experiments are connecting different paths into a shared collective journey. It is leading us through everything from experimenting with off-grid living, radical transparency, community driven - solutions for health and social care to street protests and institutional lobbying. Everything, everywhere at the same time.We want to build a new society, because we see that the house is on fire.But no society can work without an economy to support it. Economists would, in principle, be the right people to assist us in designing new economic models to support new kinds of society. They did it, in the past. Famous economists like Marx and Keynes dominated the academic debate, and visionary entrepreneurs and politicians like Charles Fourier, Robert Owen and Adriano Olivetti attempted to turn their ideas into viable businesses and policies, sometimes with spectacular successes.But in recent times economics has let us down. Economists have major influence, but they use it to recommend preserving the status quo, with a few minor tweaks. They are not thinking about radical, system-level reorganizations, that could potentially preserve the planet’s ecological balance, and include everyone in a meaningful effort to be a successful, fair civilization.But that work is necessary. Someone has to do it. So, it falls to us.We are not alone in this. A small super-brainy patrol of science fiction authors has paved the way: Cory Doctorow. Bruce Sterling. Neal Stephenson, Ursula K. Le Guin, and others. We decided to build on their work, and forge from it a new alloy of science fiction world-building and economic thinking. Building the LabAcademia, tied down in publish or perish, is uninterested: we need a new space.

<h3>Danish version below</h3>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who, what, why and how?</h3>
<h3><strong>Who will benefint:</strong></h3>
<p>We are Jan and Kirstine, owners of Dambækgaard<ins cite=""mailto:James%20Phelan"" datetime=""2020-08-02T10:24"">,</ins> a small-scale family farm in Stevns, Denmark where we for the past three years have run a small farmstay and bnb. By supporting our project, we will benefit by being able to fulfill our dream to inspire visitors to live a more sustainable lives. The support will also benefit our holiday guests who would like to live more sustainable and climate friendly, because the support will provide better facilities to teach, accommodate and serve food to more people.</p>
<h3><strong>What:</strong></h3>
<p>Our intention is to transform the farm’s old stables into a centre for sustainable life. We have recently received funding from the EU to cover 30% of the project costs and now hope to use this crowdfunding campaign to help raise the remaining 70% of funding. You can read more about how the donations will be spent below in ”What We Need &amp; How we Use the Funds</p>
<h3><strong>Why:</strong></h3>
<p>Making your daily life climate friendly can be quite a challenge, especially if you are unfamiliar with what it entails.  Living sustainably does not have to be all about abstinence. It also involves creativity and intention. The challenge comes in finding alternatives to your current lifestyle and avoiding old bad habits along the way.</p>
<p>What we are offering is for people to join us at our living lab – either as students for masterclasses or simply visiting guests – to provide them the inspiration and knowledge required to make small or large changes in their lives.  Efforts like this are needed if we want to make a positive impact on climate change for our own household and for future generations</p>
<h3><strong>How:                                                  </strong></h3>
<p>We believe in setting a positive example. Therefore, we aim to motivate visitors and teach students rather than give lectures.</p>
<p>During their stay, guests are surrounded by</p>
<ol>
<li>sustainable building</li>
<li>sustainable family life</li>
<li>sustainable food</li>
<li>sustainable farm life</li>
</ol>
<p>They will see how animals live in their natural habitat and have informative conversations with the family, farm volunteers<ins cite=""mailto:James%20Phelan"" datetime=""2020-08-02T11:05"">,</ins> and other guests. Our home will encourage guests to be more aware and open to sustainable lifestyle changes and, hopefully, inspire them to learn and do more.</p>
<p>Additionally, we will provide masterclasses for students or families who stay at the farm for a week/weekend as part of a the traditional Danish “Højskole” programme (a vocation-based school available for anyone with the desire to expand their knowledge and abilities). These longer and more intensive opportunities will give a more thorough insight into our sustainable living approaches.</p>
<h3><strong>Our story: </strong></h3>
<p>Ten years ago, we took the bold decision and moved from Copenhagen to the farm with an ambition of fulfilling a life-long dream and becoming a self-sufficient family. After five years, we almost gave up the project. We could not maintain the farm while also being a functional family of five, raising livestock, and organically growing our produce. However, as parents we still felt an obligation to show our children the best possible example and inspire them to protect and live in respect with nature. Not knowing where to turn, we were suggested by a friend to become WWOOFing (World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms) hosts, a programme that matches volunteers and organic farm owners together. In exchange for free food accommodation provided by the hosts, volunteers work 25-30 hours per week.</p>
<p>Opening our home to (mostly) young people searching for knowledge about sustainability and ecology – and sometimes, also searching for more purpose in their lives – has changed everything for us. The extra help meant we could begin to think about developing the farm further. Our children also became English-speaking world citizens with knowledge of cultures from all seven continents. And we  gained a constant, meaningful reminder of just how important it is to pass on knowledge to the next generation.</p>
<p>For the past five years, we have hosted more than 100 volunteers from all over the world, and for the past two and a half years, we have accommodated more than 500 paying guests in a rent-out caravan, a self-made flat, and at a campsite space on our farm. Many of them have left the farm expressing how inspired they have been to sustainably improve their own habits and knowledge.</p>
<p>We were already living a life which focused on self-sufficiency, minimizing food waste, and, in general, the values of our grandmothers, so we were surprised by the impact we had on so many people, of all ages, from across the globe. Seeing that impact is what inspired us to extend our vision and expand our facilities and, accordingly, to be able to host even more people and offer more educational courses in all aspects of sustainability.</p>
<p>Our confidence  in this idea grew alongside the encouragement we received from different volunteers. Some had experience in marketing for BnBs in France. Others could share their knowledge about crowdfunding campaigns, help film the campaign video, or simply give testimonials about the environment we have been cultivating at Dambækgaard for the last half decade. They gave us the confidence we needed to realize our ambitions and succeed in creating real, lasting impact. Sustainability is, after all, not just something we value, but it is a way of life others are searching for as well.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>What We Need &amp; How we Use the Funds</h2>
<p>We need 250.000 DKK for seven different parts of the building project: </p>
<ul>
<li>Building advisors</li>
<li>A professional kitchen</li>
<li>Dinning and teaching room</li>
<li>Accommodation</li>
<li>Water solutions</li>
<li>Insulation materials</li>
<li>Building materials</li>
</ul>
<p>All of the above focus on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). </p>
<p>If we do not reach our entire goal, funds given will be used to pay for the water solutions. Ensure clean water is becoming more and more urgent and having a good water solution is crucial if we are to continue building ourselves without further funding.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Building advisors</strong></h3>
<ul><li><strong>Paying for expert advice  to ensure we utilize the right sustainable solutions during the building project</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>WHY? </strong>Although we have been living a sustainable life for many years now and have gathered experience on how to build sustainably, we are not experts and our skills have their limitations. Therefore, we have arranged for professional building advisors to make sure we choose the right method and materials in our building projects. For security and insurance reasons, authorized personnel must make some of the solutions, such as electricity and sewerage, which is part of the expenditure.</p>
<p><strong>SDG 7 (7.2), SDG 9 (9.2 and 9.5), SDG 9.B (9.B.1)</strong></p>
<h3><strong>A professional kitchen</strong></h3>
<ul><li><strong>Upcycling materials from demolished buildings</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>WHY? </strong>Today most of the inventory and materials in development construction projects goes into the dumpster. However, much of it is suitable for recycling toward new construction work – it just requires additional time and the right kind of treatment. It is our philosophy that we should stop acting as if this planet has unlimited resources and a shortage of working hands. We believe it is reverse; there are so many people on this planet but only a limited reservoir of resources. For us, taking the time to clean bricks and carefully remove tiles from an old industrial abattoir rather than produce new ones seems to be an obvious solution to lowering our carbon footprint. <strong>SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.5)</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Laying clay and linoleum flooring</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>WHY? </strong>Making floors out of clay reduces the need for concrete, which is responsible for about 8% of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions. Clay is a natural and recyclable resource, which is also more durable and less expensive than wood. However, kitchens need a washable surface be approved for professional cooking purposes. Therefore, we have decided use linoleum in the kitchen, a natural, sustainable product that biodegrades once it no longer serves as flooring.</p>
<p><strong>SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.4)</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Purchasing appliances and inventory approved for professional cooking</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>WHY? </strong>If we want to upscale the number of people we can host, feed, and accommodate, we also need to upscale our cooking facilities to comply with Danish food law. However, most professional kitchen appliances are made to be extremely durable, so we will be able to buy of our kitchen appliances second hand.</p>
<p><strong>SDG 12 (12.5)</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Installing removable windows </strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>WHY? </strong>We would like to show that sustainable construction work does not necessarily require that you have to make aesthetic compromises. The stable dates back to the 1920’es and the existing windows are typical for that time. They add a charming look, but they unfortunately do not comply with Danish building regulations and will require either changing or further insulation. By using removable windows inside of the building, we can maintain the original windows of the stable so it still matches the rest of the farm buildings.</p>
<p><strong>SDG 12 (12.5), </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Dining and teaching room</strong></h3>
<ul><li><strong>Installing clay floors</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>WHY? </strong>Making floors out of clay reduces the need for concrete, which is responsible for about 8% of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions. Clay is a natural and recyclable resource<del cite=""mailto:James%20Phelan"" datetime=""2020-08-02T12:26"">, </del> which is more durable and cheaper than wood.</p>
<p><strong>SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.4)</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Building a masonry heater from recycled bricks</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>WHY? </strong>The rooms of the restored building will have heated floors drawn from a central heating system. However, a masonry heater will also be needed to reduce the use of wood pellets and to serve as a baking and pizza oven for the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.5)</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Constructing chairs and tables from removed floor separation</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>WHY? </strong>The former floor separation was too worn down to keep as floor separation, but it is still suitable for use as furniture with the right kind of treatment. Making furniture out of the recycled wood will reduce the need to cut down trees and minimize our costs by avoiding purchasing new furniture.</p>
<p><strong>SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.5)</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Purchasing and installing panorama windows </strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>WHY? </strong>Being in touch with nature is a unique stress reducing activity and is one that allows us to recharge our batteries. Having a panoramic view over the fields and animals in their natural habitat will help inspire guests and students to re-evaluate how they regard animal life.</p>
<p><strong>SDG 3 (3.D.1)</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Purchasing AV-equipment for educational lectures </strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>WHY? </strong>Being able to teach sustainable living, cooking, growing, and building is one of the essential reasons why we are crowdfunding. It is one thing to inspire visitors to a more sustainable lifestyle by setting an example, but we would also like to be able to teach those that are interested in getting the deeper knowledge by giving lectures. Of course, there is much to learn by doing, but sometimes you also need to engage with more specific information, something especially valuable since visitors and students will not see the farm’s full annual cycle first hand.</p>
<p><strong>SDG 4 (4.7), 13 (13.3)</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>2 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms and 5 toilets</strong></h3>
<ul><li><strong>Purchasing new beds and mattresses</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>WHY? </strong>Most of the inventory for the rooms are made from re- or upcycled materials. Beds, however, will either need to be bought new or have their mattresses replaced so guests can sleep comfortably. We of course aim for the option of finding old beds and replace the mattresses.</p>
<p><strong>SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.5)</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Acquiring sinks and toilets from demolished building or home renovations</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>WHY? </strong>Sanitary inventory rarely wears down and, provided they can function well, it is a waste to dispose of them rather than making the required adjustments to make them more eco-friendly. We could also make compost toilets – but, unfortunately, they are time consuming to maintain and empty, which is why we are opting for a grey water flush solution instead (see under biological wastewater cleaning system for more information).</p>
<p><strong>SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.5)</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Acquiring removed tiles from demolished buildings</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>WHY? </strong>As we wrote in the paragraph about a professional kitchen, we believe producing new things is unnecessary when recycled materials are available. Therefore, we aim to build as much of the bathrooms from materials obtained from demolished buildings.</p>
<p><strong>SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.5)</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Water solutions</strong></h3>
<ul><li><strong>Establishing rainwater collection in the former manure tank and putting up a sand filter</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>WHY? </strong>Rainwater drawn from the roofs can be stored and used for animal water and for watering the garden in dry seasons. Additionally, we can use cleaned rainwater to do the laundry. This way we avoid using tap water, which is drinkable, unnecessarily. At the same time, we are able to keep the washing machines longer, because the tap water in our local area is so full of limestone that it wears the machine out quicker than average.</p>
<p><strong>SDG 6 (6.4)</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Building a grey water collection tank</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>WHY? </strong>We would have loved to use the collected and cleaned rainwater for use in the showers, but unfortunately, that does not comply with Danish environmental regulations. Therefore, we had to come up with some other way of minimizing our use of tap water, as clean drinking water is a worldwide sparse resource. Instead, we will dig out a water tank to collect all the grey water from the washing machines as well as showers to use for flushing toilets.</p>
<p><strong>SDG 6 (6.3 and 6.4)</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Designing and installing a biological wastewater cleaning system</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>WHY? </strong>Situated in open land, the farm is not connected to any public sewer system, so we have various options when choosing a system for cleaning the wastewater going out of the building. The most widely known solution would be to use a  ‘willow’ cleaning system, which requires a lot of space. Another option would be to use a chemical cleaning system, which is not compatible with our no chemistry beliefs. We’ve chosen to use a biocleaning system</p>

</div><h2><strong>Hvem, hvad, hvorfor og hvordan.</strong></h2><p> </p><h3>Hvem får glæde af donationen?</h3><p>Vi er Jan og Kirstine ejere af Dambækgaard, et lille familie landbrug på Stevns, hvor vi de sidste tre år har haft bondegårdsferie og bnb. Din støtte vil give os mulighed for at udleve vores drøm om at inspirere gæster til at leve mere bæredygtigt. Støtten vil også være til gavn for vores gæster, der vil leve mere bæredygtigt og klimavenligt, fordi støtten vil gøre det muligt at forbedre overnatnings- og undervisningsfaciliteter samt bedre muligheden for at servere måltider for flere gæster.</p><h3><strong>Hvad:</strong></h3><p>Vores intention er at omdanne gårdens gamle stalde til et center for bæredygtigt liv. Vi har for nylig modtaget LAG-midler, EU-midler til landdistriktsudvikling, til at dække 30% af projektets omkostninger og nu håber vi, at denne kampagne kan hjælpe med at rejse nogle af de resterende 70% af projektets finansiering. Du kan læse mere om, hvordan de rejste midler bliver brugt i afsnitten ""Hvad har vi brug for, og hvordan bruger vi pengene"" nedenfor. </p><h3><strong>Hvorfor:</strong></h3><p>At få vores hverdag til at være mere klimavenlig kan være en udfordring, især hvis du ikke helt er klar over, hvad det betyder. At leve bæredygtigt behøver ikke udelukkende at handle om afholdenhed.  Det handler også om kreativitet og intention. Udfordringen er at finde alternativer til din eksisterende livsstil og at undgå at falde tilbage i gamle dårlige vaner.</p><p>Det vil tilbyder er, at besøgende ken besøge os på vores living lab – enten som studerende i masterclasses eller ganske almindelige feriegæster og besøgende - for at kunne give dem den inspiration og viden de har brug for for at kunne lave små eller store ændringer i deres livsstil. Tiltag som disse er nødvendige, hvis vi skal påvirke klimaforandringerne positivt for vores egen såvel som for fremtidige generations skyld.</p><h3><strong>Hvordan:                                                  </strong></h3><p>Vi tror på at vise det gode eksempel. Derfor tilstræber vi at motivere og inspirere vores og studerende fremfor at give foredrag. I løbet af deres ophold vil vores gæster være omgivet af:</p><ol>
<li>bæredygtige byggeløsninger</li>
<li>bæredygtigt familie liv</li>
<li>bæredygtig mad</li>
<li>bæredygtig bondegårdsliv</li>
</ol><p>De får at se, hvordan dyr lever i naturlige omgivelser og føre informative samtaler med familien, gårdens frivillige og andre gæster. Vores hjem opfordrer gæster til at have en større bevidst-  og åbenhed overfor at lave bæredygtig livsstilsændringer og - forhåbentlig - inpirere dem til at lære og gøre mere.</p><p>Derudover vil vi tilbyde en slags højskoleophold for studenter eller familier, der bor på gården i en uge eller en weekend. Disse længere og mere intensive ophold vil give mulighed for en mere dybdegående indsigt og tilgang til bæredygtig livsstil. </p><div>
<h3><strong>Vores historie: </strong></h3>
<p>For ti år siden tog vi den dristige beslutning at flytte fra København til gården med en ambition om at udleve en vedvarende drøm om  at blive en selvforsynende familie. efter fem år, var vi meget tæt på at give op. Vi kunne ikke selv vedligeholde gården, hvis vi samtidig skulle være en velfungerende familie på fem, opdrætte dyr og dyrke økologiske grøntsager. Men som forældre følte vi stadig en forpligtelse til at være det bedste eksempel for vores børn og inspirere dem til at beskytte og leve i respekt for naturen. Vi vidste ikke, hvor vi skulle søge hjælp, da en god ven foreslog vi blev WWOOF (World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms) værter, et udvekslingsprogram der matcher frivillige og økologiske, bæredygtige producenter. Mod fri kost og logi fra værternes side arbejder de frivliige 25-30 timer pr. uge.</p>
<p>at åbne vores hjem for - overvejende - unge mennesker på jagt efter viden om bæredygtighed og økologi - og nogle gange også søgende på mere indhold i deres eget liv - har forandret alt for os. Den ekstra hjælp har gjort, at vi begyndte at tænke på at udvikle gården endnu mere.Vores børn blev engelsk talende verdensborgere med viden om kulturer fra alle verdensdele, og vi fik en vedvarende og meningsfuld påmindelse om vigtigheden af at videregive viden til den næste generation.</p>
<p>Gennem de sidste fem år har vi været værter for mere end 100 frivillige fra hele verden og igennem de sidste tre år, har vi huset mere end 500 betalende gæster i en campingvogn, en lejlighed, vi selv har bygget og en campingplads på gården. Mange af dem har givet udtryk for, hvor inspireret de er blevet til at forbedre deres egne vaner og viden på en mere bæredygtig måde</p>
<p>Vi levede allerede et liv, der fokuserede på selvforsyning, minimere madspild og - generelt - værdierne fra vores bedstemødre, så vi blev overraskede over, hvor meget vi indvirkede så mange forskellige mennesker i alle aldre fra hele verden. At få øje på en indvirkning inspirerede os til at udvide vores vision og udvide vores faciliteter og dermed få mulighed for at være værter for endnu flere mennesker og tilbyde kurser i alle aspekter af bæredygtighed.</p>
<p>Vores tro på ideen blev forstærket af den opmuntring, vi fik fra forskellige frivillige. Nogle havde erfaring med marketing for BnBs i Frankrig. Andre kunne dele deres erfaringer om crowdfunding, hjælpe med at filme og redigere videoen eller ganske enkelte bidrage med anbefalinger omkring stemningen, vi har skabt på Dambækgaard igennem det sidste halve årti. De gav os den selvtillid, vi behøvede for at realisere vores ambition og fortsætte med at skabe, en reel vedvarende indvirkning. Bæredygtighed er trods alt ikke bare noget, vi værdsætter, men en livsstil andre også søger.</p>

<h2>Hvad har vi brug for, og hvordan bruger vi pengene</h2>
<p>Vi har brug for 250.000,- til syv forskellige dele af byggeprojektet: </p>
<ul>
<li>Buyggerådgivning</li>
<li>Industrikøkken</li>
<li>Spise- og undervisningslokale</li>
<li>Værelser</li>
<li>Spildevands og gråtvandsløsninger  </li>
<li>Isoleringsmateriale</li>
<li>Byggemateriale</li>
</ul>
<p>Alle ovenstående dele fokuserer på FNs verdensmål (SDG). </p>
<p>Hvis vi ikke når vores mål, vil de givne donationer, blive brugt til at betale for bæredygtige spildevands- og gråtvandsløsninger. At sikre rent drikkevand bliver mere og mere presserende og især sikring af en god spildevandsløsning  er afgørende for, at vi selv kan færdiggøre byggeriet uden yderligere finansiering.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Byggerådgivere</strong></h3>
<ul><li><strong>at betaler for ekspert rådgivning for at siker, at vi anvender de rette bæredygtige løsninger i løbet af byggeprojektet</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>Hvorfor? </strong>Selvom vi har har levet bæredygtigt i mange år og har fået erfaring med, hvordan man bygger bæredygtigt, er vi ikke eksperter og vores evner har deres begrænsninger. Derfor har vi entreret med professionelle byggerådgivere for at sikre, vi vælger de rette metoder og materialer. Af hensyn til sikkerheden og forsikringen skal der naturligvis også autoriserede håndværksmester til at tilslutte elektricitet og kloak, hvilket er en del af udgiften til byggerådgivere. <strong>SDG 7 (7.2), SDG 9 (9.2 og 9.5), SDG 9.B (9.B.1)</strong></p>
<h2><strong>Industrikøkken</strong></h2>
<div>
<ul><li><strong>Genanvendte materialer fra nedrevne bygninger</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>Hvorfor? </strong>I dag bliver størstedelen af det inventar og materialer fra nedrevne ejendomme smidt i containeren. Men meget af det er stadig egnet til at blive genanvendt i nyt byggeri  – det kræver bare ekstra tid og den rette behandling. Det er vores filosofi, at vi bør stoppe med at opføre os, som om planeten har uanede ressourcer og mangler hænder. Vi mener, det er omvendt; der er så mange mennesker på planeten, men kun begrænsede ressourcer. For os er det oplagte løsninger at bruge tid på at rense mursten eller forsigtigt fjerne klinker fra nedlagte slagterier fremfor at producere nye, hvis vi vil mindske vores CO2 aftryk. <strong>SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.5)</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Lægge ler- og linoleumsgulve </strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>Hvorfor? </strong>At lave lergulve reducerer bruget af beton, som er ansvarlig for ca. 8% af verdens CO2 udledning. Ler er et naturligt og genanvendeligt, og det er mere holdbart og mindre dyrt end fx træ. Industrikøkkener kræver dog en vaksbar overflade, hvis de skal godkendes. Derfor påtænker vi at lægge linoleumsgulve i køkkenet, da det er et naturligt bæredygtigt produkt, der kan nedbrydes i naturen, når det ikke længere skal fungere som gulv.<strong>SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.4)</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Indkøb af godkendte køkkenmaskiner og inventar </strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>Hvorfor? </strong>Hvis vi gerne vil øge antallet af personer, der kan bo og spise på gården er vi også nødt til at opskalere vores madlavningsfaciliteter til et godkendt køkken. De fleste godkendte køkkenmaskiner er som regel meget langtidsholdbare, så vi satser på, at vi kan købe størstedelen af dem brugt. <strong>SDG 12 (12.5)</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Forsatsruder</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>Hvorfor? </strong>Vi vil gerne vise, at bæredygtigt byggeri ikke behøver at betyde, der skal indgås for mange æstetiske kompromiser. Stalden, der skal ombygges, stammer fra 1920'erne og vinduerne er typiske for den tid. De giver stalden et charmerende og autentisk udseende, men de overholder ikke ligefrem bygningsreglementet og vil enten kræve udskiftning eller efterisolering. Ved at sætte forsatsruder inden for i bygningen, kan vi bevare de originale vinduer, så udseendet stadig passer til resten af gårdens bygninger. <strong>SDG 12 (12.5), </strong></p>
<h3><strong>Spise- og undervisningslokale </strong></h3>
<ul><li><b>Lergulve</b></li></ul>
<p><strong>Hvorfor? </strong>At lave lergulve reducerer bruget af beton, som er ansvarlig for ca. 8% af verdens CO2 udledning. Ler er et naturligt og genanvendeligt, og det er mere holdbart og mindre dyrt end fx træ. <strong>SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.4)</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Masseovn af brugte mursten</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>Hvorfor? </strong>Værelserne får gulvvarme fra et centralvarmesystem, men en masseovn vil også blive anvendt for at mindske behovet for øvrig opvarmning og så den kan bruges som pizza- og bageovn for køkkenet. <strong>SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.5)</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Lave stole og borde af den gamle etageadskillelse</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>Hvorfor? </strong>Den tidligere etageadskillelse var for slidt til at kunne holde, men er med den rette behandling stadig anvendelig til møbler. At lave møbler af genanvendt træ mindsker behovet for at fælde træer og minimerer udgifterne til at købe nyt. <strong>SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.5)</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Skaffe og installere panoramavindue</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>Hvorfor? </strong>At være tæt på naturen er en enestående måde at reducere stress, som tillader dig at genoplade batterierne. Ved at indsætte et panoramavindue med udsigt over markerne og dyrene i deres naturlige omgivelser, inspirerer vi desuden gæster og frivillige til at genoverveje deres tilgang til dyreliv og dyrevelfærd. <strong>SDG 3 (3.D.1)</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Skaffe AV-udstyr til foredrag</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>Hvorfor? </strong>At få muligheden for at undervise i bæredygtig livsstil, madlavning, dyrkning og byggeri er en af de væsentligste grunde til at vi kører denne kampagne. Det er en ting at inspirere besøgende til en mere bæredygtig livsstil ved at vise det gode eksempel, men vi vil også gerne kunne underviser dem, der er interesseret i at få et dybere kendskab ved at kunne give foredrag. Selvfølgelig kan man nå langt med erfaringsbaseret læring, men nogle gange er man nødt til at beskæftige sig med mere specifik viden, noget der især er vigtigt, fordi besøgende og frivillige ikke på første hånd vil komme til at se gårdens fulde årlige cyklus. <strong>SDG 4 (4.7), 13 (13.3)</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>2 værelser, 4 badeværelser og 5 toiletter</strong></h3>
<ul><li><strong>Skaffe nye senge og madrasser</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>Hvorfor? </strong>Det meste inventar i værelserne er lavet af genanvendte materialer, men senge vil enten skulle købes nye eller som minimum få deres madras udskiftet, så gæster kan sove komfortabelt. Vi tilstræber selvfølgelig at finde gamle senge, hvor vi udskifter madrasserne. <strong>SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.5)</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Skaffe håndvakse og toiletter fra nedrivningsbygninger eller renoveringer</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>Hvorfor? </strong>Sanitetsinventar bliver sjældent slidt helt ned og forudsat, de stadig er velfungerende, er det et spild at bortskaffe dem fremfor at lave de fornødne ændringer, så de bliver mere miljøvenlige. Vi kunne selvfølgelig lave komposttoiletter, men desværre er det ret tidskrævende at vedligeholde og tømme dem, hvorfor vi i stedet satser på en gråtsvandløsning, hvor vi genanvende badevandet til toiletskyl. (se under biologisk spildevandsanlæg for mere information). <strong>SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.5)</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Skaffe gamle klinker fra nedrivningsfirmaer</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>Hvorfor? </strong>Som vi skrev under industrikøkken, mener vi, det er unødvendigt at købe nyt, når der er genbrugelige materiale til rådighed. Derfor tilstræber vi at bygge mest muligt af materialer, vi har skaffet fra nedrivningsfirmaer. <strong>SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.5)</strong></p>
<h3><strong>Vandløsninger</strong></h3>
<ul><li><strong>Establering af regnvandopsamling i den gamle ajlebeholder og opsætning af sandfilter</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>Hvorfor? </strong>Regnvand fra tagene kan opbevares og anvendes til at vande dyr og planter i tørre perioder. derudover kan vi bruge renset regnvand i vaskemaskinerne. På den måde undgår vi at bruge drikkevand unødigt. Samtidig mindsker det slitagen på vaksemaskinerne, da vandet på Stenvs er meget hårdt, og kalkindholdet slider maskinerne hurtigere op end gennemsnittet. <strong>SDG 6 (6.4)</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Gråtvandsløsning</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>Hvorfor? </strong>Vi ville rigtig gerne bruge opsamlet, renset regnvand til badevand, men desværre er det ikke tilladt i Danmark. Derfor har vi været nødt til at finde andre måder at mindske brugen af drikkevand, da rent drikkevand på verdensplan er en mangelvare.  Vi graver i stedet en rvandtank ned til opsamling af det grå vand fra bade og vaksemaskiner, som vi kan bruge til toiletskyl. <strong>SDG 6 (6.3 and 6.4)</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong>Designe og installere et biologisk rensningsanlæg til håndtering af spildevand</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>Hvorfor? </strong>Da gården ligger i det åbne land og er derfor ikke tilknyttet den offentlige kloakering, har vi flere andre muligheder for håndtering af spildevandet. En populær løsning er et pilerensningsanlæg,  som er temmelig pladskrævende - især hvis det skal håndtere spildevand fra 30 mennesker, der kan bo på gården. En anden løsning er et kemisk rensningsanlæg, som ikke rigtig passer med vores værdier om ingen kemikalier. Vi har derfor besluttet at benytte et biologisk rensningsanlæg. <strong>SDG 6 (6.3 and 6.4)</strong></p>

Who, what, why and how?
Who will benefint:
We are Jan and Kirstine, owners of Dambækgaard, a small-scale family farm in Stevns, Denmark where we for the past three years have run a small farmstay and bnb. By supporting our project, we will benefit by being able to fulfill our dream to inspire visitors to live a more sustainable lives. The support will also benefit our holiday guests who would like to live more sustainable and climate friendly, because the support will provide better facilities to teach, accommodate and serve food to more people.
What:
Our intention is to transform the farm’s old stables into a centre for sustainable life. We have recently received funding from the EU to cover 30% of the project costs and now hope to use this crowdfunding campaign to help raise the remaining 70% of funding. You can read more about how the donations will be spent below in ”What We Need & How we Use the Funds
Why:
Making your daily life climate friendly can be quite a challenge, especially if you are unfamiliar with what it entails.  Living sustainably does not have to be all about abstinence. It also involves creativity and intention. The challenge comes in finding alternatives to your current lifestyle and avoiding old bad habits along the way.
What we are offering is for people to join us at our living lab – either as students for masterclasses or simply visiting guests – to provide them the inspiration and knowledge required to make small or large changes in their lives.  Efforts like this are needed if we want to make a positive impact on climate change for our own household and for future generations
How:                                                  
We believe in setting a positive example. Therefore, we aim to motivate visitors and teach students rather than give lectures.
During their stay, guests are surrounded by

sustainable building
sustainable family life
sustainable food
sustainable farm life

They will see how animals live in their natural habitat and have informative conversations with the family, farm volunteers, and other guests. Our home will encourage guests to be more aware and open to sustainable lifestyle changes and, hopefully, inspire them to learn and do more.
Additionally, we will provide masterclasses for students or families who stay at the farm for a week/weekend as part of a the traditional Danish “Højskole” programme (a vocation-based school available for anyone with the desire to expand their knowledge and abilities). These longer and more intensive opportunities will give a more thorough insight into our sustainable living approaches.
Our story: 
Ten years ago, we took the bold decision and moved from Copenhagen to the farm with an ambition of fulfilling a life-long dream and becoming a self-sufficient family. After five years, we almost gave up the project. We could not maintain the farm while also being a functional family of five, raising livestock, and organically growing our produce. However, as parents we still felt an obligation to show our children the best possible example and inspire them to protect and live in respect with nature. Not knowing where to turn, we were suggested by a friend to become WWOOFing (World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms) hosts, a programme that matches volunteers and organic farm owners together. In exchange for free food accommodation provided by the hosts, volunteers work 25-30 hours per week.
Opening our home to (mostly) young people searching for knowledge about sustainability and ecology – and sometimes, also searching for more purpose in their lives – has changed everything for us. The extra help meant we could begin to think about developing the farm further. Our children also became English-speaking world citizens with knowledge of cultures from all seven continents. And we  gained a constant, meaningful reminder of just how important it is to pass on knowledge to the next generation.
For the past five years, we have hosted more than 100 volunteers from all over the world, and for the past two and a half years, we have accommodated more than 500 paying guests in a rent-out caravan, a self-made flat, and at a campsite space on our farm. Many of them have left the farm expressing how inspired they have been to sustainably improve their own habits and knowledge.
We were already living a life which focused on self-sufficiency, minimizing food waste, and, in general, the values of our grandmothers, so we were surprised by the impact we had on so many people, of all ages, from across the globe. Seeing that impact is what inspired us to extend our vision and expand our facilities and, accordingly, to be able to host even more people and offer more educational courses in all aspects of sustainability.
Our confidence  in this idea grew alongside the encouragement we received from different volunteers. Some had experience in marketing for BnBs in France. Others could share their knowledge about crowdfunding campaigns, help film the campaign video, or simply give testimonials about the environment we have been cultivating at Dambækgaard for the last half decade. They gave us the confidence we needed to realize our ambitions and succeed in creating real, lasting impact. Sustainability is, after all, not just something we value, but it is a way of life others are searching for as well.
 

What We Need & How we Use the Funds
We need 250.000 DKK for seven different parts of the building project: 

Building advisors
A professional kitchen
Dinning and teaching room
Accommodation
Water solutions
Insulation materials
Building materials

All of the above focus on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). 
If we do not reach our entire goal, funds given will be used to pay for the water solutions. Ensure clean water is becoming more and more urgent and having a good water solution is crucial if we are to continue building ourselves without further funding.
 
Building advisors
Paying for expert advice  to ensure we utilize the right sustainable solutions during the building project
WHY? Although we have been living a sustainable life for many years now and have gathered experience on how to build sustainably, we are not experts and our skills have their limitations. Therefore, we have arranged for professional building advisors to make sure we choose the right method and materials in our building projects. For security and insurance reasons, authorized personnel must make some of the solutions, such as electricity and sewerage, which is part of the expenditure.
SDG 7 (7.2), SDG 9 (9.2 and 9.5), SDG 9.B (9.B.1)
A professional kitchen
Upcycling materials from demolished buildings
WHY? Today most of the inventory and materials in development construction projects goes into the dumpster. However, much of it is suitable for recycling toward new construction work – it just requires additional time and the right kind of treatment. It is our philosophy that we should stop acting as if this planet has unlimited resources and a shortage of working hands. We believe it is reverse; there are so many people on this planet but only a limited reservoir of resources. For us, taking the time to clean bricks and carefully remove tiles from an old industrial abattoir rather than produce new ones seems to be an obvious solution to lowering our carbon footprint. SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.5)
Laying clay and linoleum flooring
WHY? Making floors out of clay reduces the need for concrete, which is responsible for about 8% of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions. Clay is a natural and recyclable resource, which is also more durable and less expensive than wood. However, kitchens need a washable surface be approved for professional cooking purposes. Therefore, we have decided use linoleum in the kitchen, a natural, sustainable product that biodegrades once it no longer serves as flooring.
SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.4)
Purchasing appliances and inventory approved for professional cooking
WHY? If we want to upscale the number of people we can host, feed, and accommodate, we also need to upscale our cooking facilities to comply with Danish food law. However, most professional kitchen appliances are made to be extremely durable, so we will be able to buy of our kitchen appliances second hand.
SDG 12 (12.5)
Installing removable windows 
WHY? We would like to show that sustainable construction work does not necessarily require that you have to make aesthetic compromises. The stable dates back to the 1920’es and the existing windows are typical for that time. They add a charming look, but they unfortunately do not comply with Danish building regulations and will require either changing or further insulation. By using removable windows inside of the building, we can maintain the original windows of the stable so it still matches the rest of the farm buildings.
SDG 12 (12.5), 
Dining and teaching room
Installing clay floors
WHY? Making floors out of clay reduces the need for concrete, which is responsible for about 8% of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions. Clay is a natural and recyclable resource,  which is more durable and cheaper than wood.
SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.4)
Building a masonry heater from recycled bricks
WHY? The rooms of the restored building will have heated floors drawn from a central heating system. However, a masonry heater will also be needed to reduce the use of wood pellets and to serve as a baking and pizza oven for the kitchen.
SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.5)
Constructing chairs and tables from removed floor separation
WHY? The former floor separation was too worn down to keep as floor separation, but it is still suitable for use as furniture with the right kind of treatment. Making furniture out of the recycled wood will reduce the need to cut down trees and minimize our costs by avoiding purchasing new furniture.
SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.5)
Purchasing and installing panorama windows 
WHY? Being in touch with nature is a unique stress reducing activity and is one that allows us to recharge our batteries. Having a panoramic view over the fields and animals in their natural habitat will help inspire guests and students to re-evaluate how they regard animal life.
SDG 3 (3.D.1)
Purchasing AV-equipment for educational lectures 
WHY? Being able to teach sustainable living, cooking, growing, and building is one of the essential reasons why we are crowdfunding. It is one thing to inspire visitors to a more sustainable lifestyle by setting an example, but we would also like to be able to teach those that are interested in getting the deeper knowledge by giving lectures. Of course, there is much to learn by doing, but sometimes you also need to engage with more specific information, something especially valuable since visitors and students will not see the farm’s full annual cycle first hand.
SDG 4 (4.7), 13 (13.3)
 
2 bedrooms, 4 bathrooms and 5 toilets
Purchasing new beds and mattresses
WHY? Most of the inventory for the rooms are made from re- or upcycled materials. Beds, however, will either need to be bought new or have their mattresses replaced so guests can sleep comfortably. We of course aim for the option of finding old beds and replace the mattresses.
SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.5)
Acquiring sinks and toilets from demolished building or home renovations
WHY? Sanitary inventory rarely wears down and, provided they can function well, it is a waste to dispose of them rather than making the required adjustments to make them more eco-friendly. We could also make compost toilets – but, unfortunately, they are time consuming to maintain and empty, which is why we are opting for a grey water flush solution instead (see under biological wastewater cleaning system for more information).
SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.5)
Acquiring removed tiles from demolished buildings
WHY? As we wrote in the paragraph about a professional kitchen, we believe producing new things is unnecessary when recycled materials are available. Therefore, we aim to build as much of the bathrooms from materials obtained from demolished buildings.
SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.5)
Water solutions
Establishing rainwater collection in the former manure tank and putting up a sand filter
WHY? Rainwater drawn from the roofs can be stored and used for animal water and for watering the garden in dry seasons. Additionally, we can use cleaned rainwater to do the laundry. This way we avoid using tap water, which is drinkable, unnecessarily. At the same time, we are able to keep the washing machines longer, because the tap water in our local area is so full of limestone that it wears the machine out quicker than average.
SDG 6 (6.4)
Building a grey water collection tank
WHY? We would have loved to use the collected and cleaned rainwater for use in the showers, but unfortunately, that does not comply with Danish environmental regulations. Therefore, we had to come up with some other way of minimizing our use of tap water, as clean drinking water is a worldwide sparse resource. Instead, we will dig out a water tank to collect all the grey water from the washing machines as well as showers to use for flushing toilets.
SDG 6 (6.3 and 6.4)
Designing and installing a biological wastewater cleaning system
WHY? Situated in open land, the farm is not connected to any public sewer system, so we have various options when choosing a system for cleaning the wastewater going out of the building. The most widely known solution would be to use a  ‘willow’ cleaning system, which requires a lot of space. Another option would be to use a chemical cleaning system, which is not compatible with our no chemistry beliefs. We’ve chosen to use a biocleaning system
SDG 6 (6.3 and 6.4)
 

The difference your donation makes
Your donations will help us:

choose the most sustainable solutions
inspire even more people to live sustainably and climate friendly
make travelling more sustainable and reduce the waste usually associate with travelling
offer you the facilities to travel and learn sustainably
 


Is there a risk and how do you handle it? 
If we don't reach our target, we will have to build more ourselves and less by hired help. Building on your own is always a risk, because there are no guarantees that you have the required skills.
To make sure we choose the right solutions we have established a teamwork with local craftsmen and constructors to provide advice and guidance for free and give us a paid hand when we have the means to pay them.
I don't have any money, but I'd really like to help

We can use all the help we can get, so if you don't have the means to contribute financially there are other ways:

a helping hand in exchange for plenty accommodation and plenty of good food is always welcome.

Hvem, hvad, hvorfor og hvordan. Hvem får glæde af donationen?Vi er Jan og Kirstine ejere af Dambækgaard, et lille familie landbrug på Stevns, hvor vi de sidste tre år har haft bondegårdsferie og bnb. Din støtte vil give os mulighed for at udleve vores drøm om at inspirere gæster til at leve mere bæredygtigt. Støtten vil også være til gavn for vores gæster, der vil leve mere bæredygtigt og klimavenligt, fordi støtten vil gøre det muligt at forbedre overnatnings- og undervisningsfaciliteter samt bedre muligheden for at servere måltider for flere gæster.Hvad:Vores intention er at omdanne gårdens gamle stalde til et center for bæredygtigt liv. Vi har for nylig modtaget LAG-midler, EU-midler til landdistriktsudvikling, til at dække 30% af projektets omkostninger og nu håber vi, at denne kampagne kan hjælpe med at rejse nogle af de resterende 70% af projektets finansiering. Du kan læse mere om, hvordan de rejste midler bliver brugt i afsnitten ""Hvad har vi brug for, og hvordan bruger vi pengene"" nedenfor. Hvorfor:At få vores hverdag til at være mere klimavenlig kan være en udfordring, især hvis du ikke helt er klar over, hvad det betyder. At leve bæredygtigt behøver ikke udelukkende at handle om afholdenhed.  Det handler også om kreativitet og intention. Udfordringen er at finde alternativer til din eksisterende livsstil og at undgå at falde tilbage i gamle dårlige vaner.Det vil tilbyder er, at besøgende ken besøge os på vores living lab – enten som studerende i masterclasses eller ganske almindelige feriegæster og besøgende - for at kunne give dem den inspiration og viden de har brug for for at kunne lave små eller store ændringer i deres livsstil. Tiltag som disse er nødvendige, hvis vi skal påvirke klimaforandringerne positivt for vores egen såvel som for fremtidige generations skyld.Hvordan:                                                  Vi tror på at vise det gode eksempel. Derfor tilstræber vi at motivere og inspirere vores og studerende fremfor at give foredrag. I løbet af deres ophold vil vores gæster være omgivet af:
bæredygtige byggeløsninger
bæredygtigt familie liv
bæredygtig mad
bæredygtig bondegårdsliv
De får at se, hvordan dyr lever i naturlige omgivelser og føre informative samtaler med familien, gårdens frivillige og andre gæster. Vores hjem opfordrer gæster til at have en større bevidst-  og åbenhed overfor at lave bæredygtig livsstilsændringer og - forhåbentlig - inpirere dem til at lære og gøre mere.Derudover vil vi tilbyde en slags højskoleophold for studenter eller familier, der bor på gården i en uge eller en weekend. Disse længere og mere intensive ophold vil give mulighed for en mere dybdegående indsigt og tilgang til bæredygtig livsstil. 
Vores historie: 
For ti år siden tog vi den dristige beslutning at flytte fra København til gården med en ambition om at udleve en vedvarende drøm om  at blive en selvforsynende familie. efter fem år, var vi meget tæt på at give op. Vi kunne ikke selv vedligeholde gården, hvis vi samtidig skulle være en velfungerende familie på fem, opdrætte dyr og dyrke økologiske grøntsager. Men som forældre følte vi stadig en forpligtelse til at være det bedste eksempel for vores børn og inspirere dem til at beskytte og leve i respekt for naturen. Vi vidste ikke, hvor vi skulle søge hjælp, da en god ven foreslog vi blev WWOOF (World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms) værter, et udvekslingsprogram der matcher frivillige og økologiske, bæredygtige producenter. Mod fri kost og logi fra værternes side arbejder de frivliige 25-30 timer pr. uge.
at åbne vores hjem for - overvejende - unge mennesker på jagt efter viden om bæredygtighed og økologi - og nogle gange også søgende på mere indhold i deres eget liv - har forandret alt for os. Den ekstra hjælp har gjort, at vi begyndte at tænke på at udvikle gården endnu mere.Vores børn blev engelsk talende verdensborgere med viden om kulturer fra alle verdensdele, og vi fik en vedvarende og meningsfuld påmindelse om vigtigheden af at videregive viden til den næste generation.
Gennem de sidste fem år har vi været værter for mere end 100 frivillige fra hele verden og igennem de sidste tre år, har vi huset mere end 500 betalende gæster i en campingvogn, en lejlighed, vi selv har bygget og en campingplads på gården. Mange af dem har givet udtryk for, hvor inspireret de er blevet til at forbedre deres egne vaner og viden på en mere bæredygtig måde
Vi levede allerede et liv, der fokuserede på selvforsyning, minimere madspild og - generelt - værdierne fra vores bedstemødre, så vi blev overraskede over, hvor meget vi indvirkede så mange forskellige mennesker i alle aldre fra hele verden. At få øje på en indvirkning inspirerede os til at udvide vores vision og udvide vores faciliteter og dermed få mulighed for at være værter for endnu flere mennesker og tilbyde kurser i alle aspekter af bæredygtighed.
Vores tro på ideen blev forstærket af den opmuntring, vi fik fra forskellige frivillige. Nogle havde erfaring med marketing for BnBs i Frankrig. Andre kunne dele deres erfaringer om crowdfunding, hjælpe med at filme og redigere videoen eller ganske enkelte bidrage med anbefalinger omkring stemningen, vi har skabt på Dambækgaard igennem det sidste halve årti. De gav os den selvtillid, vi behøvede for at realisere vores ambition og fortsætte med at skabe, en reel vedvarende indvirkning. Bæredygtighed er trods alt ikke bare noget, vi værdsætter, men en livsstil andre også søger.
 

Hvad har vi brug for, og hvordan bruger vi pengene
Vi har brug for 250.000,- til syv forskellige dele af byggeprojektet: 

Buyggerådgivning
Industrikøkken
Spise- og undervisningslokale
Værelser
Spildevands og gråtvandsløsninger  
Isoleringsmateriale
Byggemateriale

Alle ovenstående dele fokuserer på FNs verdensmål (SDG). 
Hvis vi ikke når vores mål, vil de givne donationer, blive brugt til at betale for bæredygtige spildevands- og gråtvandsløsninger. At sikre rent drikkevand bliver mere og mere presserende og især sikring af en god spildevandsløsning  er afgørende for, at vi selv kan færdiggøre byggeriet uden yderligere finansiering.
 
Byggerådgivere
at betaler for ekspert rådgivning for at siker, at vi anvender de rette bæredygtige løsninger i løbet af byggeprojektet
Hvorfor? Selvom vi har har levet bæredygtigt i mange år og har fået erfaring med, hvordan man bygger bæredygtigt, er vi ikke eksperter og vores evner har deres begrænsninger. Derfor har vi entreret med professionelle byggerådgivere for at sikre, vi vælger de rette metoder og materialer. Af hensyn til sikkerheden og forsikringen skal der naturligvis også autoriserede håndværksmester til at tilslutte elektricitet og kloak, hvilket er en del af udgiften til byggerådgivere. SDG 7 (7.2), SDG 9 (9.2 og 9.5), SDG 9.B (9.B.1)
Industrikøkken

Genanvendte materialer fra nedrevne bygninger
Hvorfor? I dag bliver størstedelen af det inventar og materialer fra nedrevne ejendomme smidt i containeren. Men meget af det er stadig egnet til at blive genanvendt i nyt byggeri  – det kræver bare ekstra tid og den rette behandling. Det er vores filosofi, at vi bør stoppe med at opføre os, som om planeten har uanede ressourcer og mangler hænder. Vi mener, det er omvendt; der er så mange mennesker på planeten, men kun begrænsede ressourcer. For os er det oplagte løsninger at bruge tid på at rense mursten eller forsigtigt fjerne klinker fra nedlagte slagterier fremfor at producere nye, hvis vi vil mindske vores CO2 aftryk. SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.5)
Lægge ler- og linoleumsgulve 
Hvorfor? At lave lergulve reducerer bruget af beton, som er ansvarlig for ca. 8% af verdens CO2 udledning. Ler er et naturligt og genanvendeligt, og det er mere holdbart og mindre dyrt end fx træ. Industrikøkkener kræver dog en vaksbar overflade, hvis de skal godkendes. Derfor påtænker vi at lægge linoleumsgulve i køkkenet, da det er et naturligt bæredygtigt produkt, der kan nedbrydes i naturen, når det ikke længere skal fungere som gulv.SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.4)
Indkøb af godkendte køkkenmaskiner og inventar 
Hvorfor? Hvis vi gerne vil øge antallet af personer, der kan bo og spise på gården er vi også nødt til at opskalere vores madlavningsfaciliteter til et godkendt køkken. De fleste godkendte køkkenmaskiner er som regel meget langtidsholdbare, så vi satser på, at vi kan købe størstedelen af dem brugt. SDG 12 (12.5)
Forsatsruder
Hvorfor? Vi vil gerne vise, at bæredygtigt byggeri ikke behøver at betyde, der skal indgås for mange æstetiske kompromiser. Stalden, der skal ombygges, stammer fra 1920'erne og vinduerne er typiske for den tid. De giver stalden et charmerende og autentisk udseende, men de overholder ikke ligefrem bygningsreglementet og vil enten kræve udskiftning eller efterisolering. Ved at sætte forsatsruder inden for i bygningen, kan vi bevare de originale vinduer, så udseendet stadig passer til resten af gårdens bygninger. SDG 12 (12.5), 
Spise- og undervisningslokale 
Lergulve
Hvorfor? At lave lergulve reducerer bruget af beton, som er ansvarlig for ca. 8% af verdens CO2 udledning. Ler er et naturligt og genanvendeligt, og det er mere holdbart og mindre dyrt end fx træ. SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.4)
Masseovn af brugte mursten
Hvorfor? Værelserne får gulvvarme fra et centralvarmesystem, men en masseovn vil også blive anvendt for at mindske behovet for øvrig opvarmning og så den kan bruges som pizza- og bageovn for køkkenet. SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.5)
Lave stole og borde af den gamle etageadskillelse
Hvorfor? Den tidligere etageadskillelse var for slidt til at kunne holde, men er med den rette behandling stadig anvendelig til møbler. At lave møbler af genanvendt træ mindsker behovet for at fælde træer og minimerer udgifterne til at købe nyt. SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.5)
Skaffe og installere panoramavindue
Hvorfor? At være tæt på naturen er en enestående måde at reducere stress, som tillader dig at genoplade batterierne. Ved at indsætte et panoramavindue med udsigt over markerne og dyrene i deres naturlige omgivelser, inspirerer vi desuden gæster og frivillige til at genoverveje deres tilgang til dyreliv og dyrevelfærd. SDG 3 (3.D.1)
Skaffe AV-udstyr til foredrag
Hvorfor? At få muligheden for at undervise i bæredygtig livsstil, madlavning, dyrkning og byggeri er en af de væsentligste grunde til at vi kører denne kampagne. Det er en ting at inspirere besøgende til en mere bæredygtig livsstil ved at vise det gode eksempel, men vi vil også gerne kunne underviser dem, der er interesseret i at få et dybere kendskab ved at kunne give foredrag. Selvfølgelig kan man nå langt med erfaringsbaseret læring, men nogle gange er man nødt til at beskæftige sig med mere specifik viden, noget der især er vigtigt, fordi besøgende og frivillige ikke på første hånd vil komme til at se gårdens fulde årlige cyklus. SDG 4 (4.7), 13 (13.3)
 
2 værelser, 4 badeværelser og 5 toiletter
Skaffe nye senge og madrasser
Hvorfor? Det meste inventar i værelserne er lavet af genanvendte materialer, men senge vil enten skulle købes nye eller som minimum få deres madras udskiftet, så gæster kan sove komfortabelt. Vi tilstræber selvfølgelig at finde gamle senge, hvor vi udskifter madrasserne. SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.5)
Skaffe håndvakse og toiletter fra nedrivningsbygninger eller renoveringer
Hvorfor? Sanitetsinventar bliver sjældent slidt helt ned og forudsat, de stadig er velfungerende, er det et spild at bortskaffe dem fremfor at lave de fornødne ændringer, så de bliver mere miljøvenlige. Vi kunne selvfølgelig lave komposttoiletter, men desværre er det ret tidskrævende at vedligeholde og tømme dem, hvorfor vi i stedet satser på en gråtsvandløsning, hvor vi genanvende badevandet til toiletskyl. (se under biologisk spildevandsanlæg for mere information). SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.5)
Skaffe gamle klinker fra nedrivningsfirmaer
Hvorfor? Som vi skrev under industrikøkken, mener vi, det er unødvendigt at købe nyt, når der er genbrugelige materiale til rådighed. Derfor tilstræber vi at bygge mest muligt af materialer, vi har skaffet fra nedrivningsfirmaer. SDG 12 (12.2.2 and 12.5)
Vandløsninger
Establering af regnvandopsamling i den gamle ajlebeholder og opsætning af sandfilter
Hvorfor? Regnvand fra tagene kan opbevares og anvendes til at vande dyr og planter i tørre perioder. derudover kan vi bruge renset regnvand i vaskemaskinerne. På den måde undgår vi at bruge drikkevand unødigt. Samtidig mindsker det slitagen på vaksemaskinerne, da vandet på Stenvs er meget hårdt, og kalkindholdet slider maskinerne hurtigere op end gennemsnittet. SDG 6 (6.4)
Gråtvandsløsning
Hvorfor? Vi ville rigtig gerne bruge opsamlet, renset regnvand til badevand, men desværre er det ikke tilladt i Danmark. Derfor har vi været nødt til at finde andre måder at mindske brugen af drikkevand, da rent drikkevand på verdensplan er en mangelvare.  Vi graver i stedet en rvandtank ned til opsamling af det grå vand fra bade og vaksemaskiner, som vi kan bruge til toiletskyl. SDG 6 (6.3 and 6.4)
Designe og installere et biologisk rensningsanlæg til håndtering af spildevand
Hvorfor? Da gården ligger i det åbne land og er derfor ikke tilknyttet den offentlige kloakering, har vi flere andre muligheder for håndtering af spildevandet. En populær løsning er et pilerensningsanlæg,  som er temmelig pladskrævende - især hvis det skal håndtere spildevand fra 30 mennesker, der kan bo på gården. En anden løsning er et kemisk rensningsanlæg, som ikke rigtig passer med vores værdier om ingen kemikalier. Vi har derfor besluttet at benytte et biologisk rensningsanlæg. SDG 6 (6.3 and 6.4)

Hvilken forskel gør dit bidrag?
Dit bidrag vil hjælpe os med at:

vælge de mest bæredygtigt løsninger
inspirere endnu flere mennesker til at leve mere bæredygtigt og klimavenligt
gøre rejsende mere bevidste om bæredygtighed og reducere den CO2 udledning, der normalt er forbundet med overnatninger 
give dig faciliteterne til at overnatte og lære bæredygtigt 



Er der en risiko, og hvordan håndterer I den? 
Hvis vi ikke når vores mål, er vi nødsaget til at bygge alting selv med mindre hjælp fra håndværkere. At bygge selv er altid en risiko, fordi der ikke er nogen garanti for, du har evnerne.
For at sikre vi træffer de rigtige valg har vi etableret et samarbejde med lokale håndværkere, der har tilbudt at vejlede og rådgive os gratis og få betaling efterhånden, som vi oparbejder kapital til at betale dem.
Jeg har ikke nogen penge, men vil stadig rigtig gerne hjælpe


Vi kan bruge al den hjælp, vi kan få, så hvis du gerne vil hjælpe, men ikke lige har råd til et kontant bidrag, er der også andre muligheder:

en hjælpende hånd i bytte for overnatning og rigelig mad er altid velkomment

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>We, Vols for VMC, are raising money for the Volunteer Ministry Center (VMC) to provide bedding and pillows to the Foyer, a low-barrier overnight shelter opening in downtown Knoxville in late fall of 2019. The Foyer will house individuals who are currently not accessing services from the traditional overnight shelter.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>We are a group of University of Tennessee students raising money to provide bedding and pillows for the new low-barrier shelter, the Foyer. Our group was formed through a Public Writing class at the university. All members of Vols for VMC believe that housing is a basic human need.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What is the Foyer?</h2>
<p>The Foyer will provide 40-45 beds to accommodate individuals who are currently not accessing the traditional overnight shelter. “Reasons may include mental illness, which can cause a fear of large crowds, as well as those who have linked up with a companion and need to stay with that person or, in some cases, a pet,” explains Mary Beth Ramey, VMC Chief Development Officer. Street Outreach workers will meet with these at-risk individuals and make referrals to the Foyer based on their vulnerability.</p>
<p>While the Foyer is considered “low-barrier” compared to the nearby traditional shelter, those admitted will still follow certain rules. Weapons and substance use are not allowed on the premises, and respect and civility towards neighbors will be emphasized. The Foyer will be located in the Salvation Army thrift store (pictured below) and will therefore be easily accessed by the homeless who gather under the nearby I-40 overpass. In collaboration with the Salvation Army, the shelter will be named “The Foyer” as it is designed to be an “entrance” to securing permanent housing.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570752292/tnbinnralcd8uj19ldc8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The VMC has studied the local homeless population and has been brainstorming ways to help every individual experiencing homelessness. The solution was the Foyer, which provides a roof and bed to individuals who would otherwise be left out in the elements.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why You Should Care</h2>
<p>By donating to our campaign, not only will you help supply bedding for the shelter, but you will also help individuals in need who are unable to stay at a traditional shelter. With cold weather quickly approaching, helping these individuals is crucial. Symptoms of hypothermia arise when temperatures fall under 50℉, which is typical of late fall in Knoxville. As you turn up the heat in preparation for cold nights, turn your thoughts to those sleeping under the bridge who would benefit from the Foyer. Every $25 donated to our campaign will provide warm bedding to an individual in extreme need.</p>
<p>According to the Knoxville-Knox County Homeless Coalition (KKCHC) Biennial Study, 64% of the homeless population in Knox County reported a history of mental health treatment. Out of that group, 48% are currently receiving mental health treatment. These statistics highlight why the Foyer is such a great solution to provide shelter to individuals who are currently sleeping in the streets; this is the first step in the journey to end homelessness. By donating, you are improving the quality of life of a group that is currently underserved in downtown Knoxville.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Breaking It Down</h2>
<p>In October 2017, partners of KKCHC surveyed individuals sleeping under the I-40 Overpass to better understand how to link the people “under the bridge” to social services. These surveys were conducted after a noticeable increase in those who congregate or sleep under the I-40 overpass on Broadway Avenue. The questionnaire was administered to one hundred respondents with the results shown below:</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570752540/ao8fknum6pf4h8flilrw.png"" src=""""/><p>The main takeaway from this survey was that 54% of the respondents identified as using some type of social services. However, 43% of them were not making use of services that assist in escaping homelessness. This data shows that there is a significant group that can be reached through implementation of the Foyer. The Foyer gives shelter to the individuals who are currently not accessing traditional shelters and provides assistance in permanently escaping homelessness.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>About Volunteer Ministry Center</h2>
<p>The Volunteer Ministry Center is a non-profit organization that provides special services to individuals experiencing homelessness. The VMC was founded by downtown churches in 1987 in response to the need for a daytime shelter for the increasing population of homeless people. VMC’s two-fold mission includes providing permanent supportive housing for those experiencing homelessness and providing services to prevent homelessness.</p>
<p> </p>

By donating to our campaign, not only will you help supply bedding for the shelter, but you will also help individuals in need who are unable to stay at a traditional shelter. With cold weather quickly approaching, helping these individuals is crucial. Symptoms of hypothermia arise when temperatures fall under 50℉, which is typical of late fall in Knoxville. As you turn up the heat in preparation for cold nights, turn your thoughts to those sleeping under the bridge who would benefit from the Foyer. Every $25 donated to our campaign will provide warm bedding to an individual in extreme need.
According to the Knoxville-Knox County Homeless Coalition (KKCHC) Biennial Study, 64% of the homeless population in Knox County reported a history of mental health treatment. Out of that group, 48% are currently receiving mental health treatment. These statistics highlight why the Foyer is such a great solution to provide shelter to individuals who are currently sleeping in the streets; this is the first step in the journey to end homelessness. By donating, you are improving the quality of life of a group that is currently underserved in downtown Knoxville.
 
Breaking It Down
In October 2017, partners of KKCHC surveyed individuals sleeping under the I-40 Overpass to better understand how to link the people “under the bridge” to social services. These surveys were conducted after a noticeable increase in those who congregate or sleep under the I-40 overpass on Broadway Avenue. The questionnaire was administered to one hundred respondents with the results shown below:
The main takeaway from this survey was that 54% of the respondents identified as using some type of social services. However, 43% of them were not making use of services that assist in escaping homelessness. This data shows that there is a significant group that can be reached through implementation of the Foyer. The Foyer gives shelter to the individuals who are currently not accessing traditional shelters and provides assistance in permanently escaping homelessness.
 
About Volunteer Ministry Center
The Volunteer Ministry Center is a non-profit organization that provides special services to individuals experiencing homelessness. The VMC was founded by downtown churches in 1987 in response to the need for a daytime shelter for the increasing population of homeless people. VMC’s two-fold mission includes providing permanent supportive housing for those experiencing homelessness and providing services to prevent homelessness.

<div>PET Cup is a trophy made of PET (polyethylene-terephthalate) bottles collected from one of the most heavily polluted river in Europe: the Tisza. It's the main award of a long-distance boat-race aka the PET Cup - the only boat race in the world we know of where boats are built partly or completely from environmental pollution. The mission of the PET boats is to collect plastic from the river, to raise awareness, to educate and to entertain. The first PET Cup held in 2013 was a great success. PET boats collected nearly 10.000 bottles from the Tisza and a 3 part television series was produced. In 2014 we want to launch a second attack against the pollution wave and we want to turn the PET Cup into a tradition.</div>

<div>Each year, tons of domestic and industrial waste is deposited into the ﬂood basin of the Upper Tisza and its afﬂuent rivers. There are regions in Ukraine and Romania where people cannot afford to pay for the transportation of domestic waste. The nearby Tisza offers an easy option. The flood basin stores the garbage and the spring flood takes away most of it - for free. The situation is very depressing at places like at the connection of the White and the Black Tisza. The countless PET bottles, plastic bags and other garbage are swept away by the annual ﬂood of the river and turns the otherwise beautiful Tisza into a moving dumpsite. Tens of thousands of PET bottles are drifting on the surface. In severe cases more than 50 percent of the surface is covered with trash, a phenomenon aka the annual PET Bottle Flood. After the flood the shorline is covered with plastic bags and PET bottles. Some places - like the Jandi Island in Hungary - are so badly affected that the height of plastic piles can reach several meters and increasing. <br/>

<h3>What we're up to?</h3>
In 2013 altogether 4 PET boats covered more than 100 kilometres on the river, collected nearly 10.000 PET bottles, a 3 part documentary series was produced and the event was covered in two languages (<a href=""http://facebook.com/petkupa"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hungarian</a> and <a href=""http://facebook.com/petcup"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">English</a>) on Facebook. In 2014 we want to cover the same distance, but we want more PET boats to build, more bottles to collect, more videos to make and reach a bigger audience than ever before. The 2nd PET Cup will be held between 15-23 of August, 2014. During and after the event a small film crew is about to produce short videos for the Internet.<br/><p style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-attachment: initial; background-color: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><span style=""line-height: 30px;""><b><br/></b></span></span></p>

<p>For the 2nd PET Cup we need a total amount of 6500 USD. Feeding the PET Pirates and guaranteeing their safety are the two main costs we have to count with. To document the PET Cup a 2-member camera team is also needed which will produce short videos on and after the event. If our budget allows we will invite artists and musicians who can show the PET pirates and the local audience how many ways garbage can be used. Before launching the PET boats we need to get permissions and we need a bit of money for building and construction materials as well. If we do not reach the required amount, the funds will go into securing the PET pirates while on water and into filming activities. If we over-reach the goal we will start to edit the hundreds of hours of HD footage obtained during the 1st and 2nd PET Cup into a feature documentary.</p>

</div><div><ul></ul></div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul>
<li>
<b>Cleaning the Tisza:</b> with your help we will collect more than 10.000 bottles out of the river and make sure they will get recycled - just like the entire PET fleet (approx. 15 thousand PET bottles).</li> <li>
<b>Bringing closer communities:</b> by visiting villages and inviting local people to join our efforts PET Cup offers a unique opportunity to do something against the pollution.</li> <li>
<b>Public awareness:</b> the aim of the PET Cup is to direct public attention towards the Tisza river in Eastern Europe where pollution have grown too big for us to ignore. We believe that short videos, the social media - along with feature articles and television documentaries - will spread the message through borders.</li>
<li>

PET Cup is a trophy made of PET (polyethylene-terephthalate) bottles collected from one of the most heavily polluted river in Europe: the Tisza. It's the main award of a long-distance boat-race aka the PET Cup - the only boat race in the world we know of where boats are built partly or completely from environmental pollution. The mission of the PET boats is to collect plastic from the river, to raise awareness, to educate and to entertain. The first PET Cup held in 2013 was a great success. PET boats collected nearly 10.000 bottles from the Tisza and a 3 part television series was produced. In 2014 we want to launch a second attack against the pollution wave and we want to turn the PET Cup into a tradition.
NOTE: This project was written by Hungarians. Sorry for spelling and grammatical mistakes. Köszönjük! (Thanks - in Hungarian).







Pollution is depressing 
Each year, tons of domestic and industrial waste is deposited into the ﬂood basin of the Upper Tisza and its afﬂuent rivers. There are regions in Ukraine and Romania where people cannot afford to pay for the transportation of domestic waste. The nearby Tisza offers an easy option. The flood basin stores the garbage and the spring flood takes away most of it - for free. The situation is very depressing at places like at the connection of the White and the Black Tisza. The countless PET bottles, plastic bags and other garbage are swept away by the annual ﬂood of the river and turns the otherwise beautiful Tisza into a moving dumpsite. Tens of thousands of PET bottles are drifting on the surface. In severe cases more than 50 percent of the surface is covered with trash, a phenomenon aka the annual PET Bottle Flood. After the flood the shorline is covered with plastic bags and PET bottles. Some places - like the Jandi Island in Hungary - are so badly affected that the height of plastic piles can reach several meters and increasing. 


Tisza is a river. It's here:




We think it should look like this:




Instead, in many places it looks like this:


PET Cup is inspiring
When seeing this, we knew that something can be done to stop this repeating wave of pollution. The collection of the trash however, is a depressing and sad activity. How to turn it into something more useful, inspiring and entertaining? How to reach an impact big enough to change people's mind on this issue in Hungary and abroad? We think the answer is to turn it's own weapon against the pollution, which is - 
the PET bottle itself:


With the strong support of local communities PET Cup starts with well-organized ""hunts"" for PET bottles and other items made of plastic and thrown in the river:


The PET Cup continues with a boat-building competition where PET boats are built from the garbage:




As soon as they're on the water, PET pirates raise the battle against PET pollution to another level:



They attack the strongholds of PET bottles sometimes several meters high:



Collecting thousands of PET bottles in the course of a single day: 



Or a bit less, but still they do their best:

At the end of the one-week long boat race the best PET boat is about to win the not-so-beautiful trophy made of garbage:


The PET Cup:



And of course, every PET boat is to be recycled:




Who we are and what we do?We are environmental filmmakers working for a Budapest-based NGO called the Filmjungle Society. Funded in 1996 Filmjungle Society had become the most productive production unit in the country making award-winning wildlife and conservation documentaries for national and international audience. Filmjungle Society happens to be the brainparent of the PET Cup. Our knowledge in edutainment seems to be very useful when it comes to bringing together communities and directing public attention to important issues. Oohhh, that sounds sooo official. 



Cutting the long story short, we make film(s) about the whole thing:

We are professionals:

We have the equipment and determination:

And we always put the camera in the best possible hands:




What we're up to?
In 2013 altogether 4 PET boats covered more than 100 kilometres on the river, collected nearly 10.000 PET bottles, a 3 part documentary series was produced and the event was covered in two languages (Hungarian and English) on Facebook. In 2014 we want to cover the same distance, but we want more PET boats to build, more bottles to collect, more videos to make and reach a bigger audience than ever before. The 2nd PET Cup will be held between 15-23 of August, 2014. During and after the event a small film crew is about to produce short videos for the Internet.



Where the funds will go








For the 2nd PET Cup we need a total amount of 6500 USD. Feeding the PET Pirates and guaranteeing their safety are the two main costs we have to count with. To document the PET Cup a 2-member camera team is also needed which will produce short videos on and after the event. If our budget allows we will invite artists and musicians who can show the PET pirates and the local audience how many ways garbage can be used. Before launching the PET boats we need to get permissions and we need a bit of money for building and construction materials as well. If we do not reach the required amount, the funds will go into securing the PET pirates while on water and into filming activities. If we over-reach the goal we will start to edit the hundreds of hours of HD footage obtained during the 1st and 2nd PET Cup into a feature documentary.
Your donation will be received by Filmjungle.eu Society. This non-profit NGO have been producing conservation documentaries and wildlife films for more than 15 years. It's award winning list of films include titles such as 'Sharks in my Viewfinder', 'Invisible Wildlife Photographer', 'Budapest Wild', 'Wolfwatching', 'Antarctica - Life in the Frozen Oasis'. Filmjungle has its own channel on Vimeo with a wide collection of VOD content. If you decide to support the PET Cup, Filmjungle can provide you personal access to some of its contents, including the doc-series on the 1st PET Cup (with English subtitles). 
  The Impact 

Cleaning the Tisza: with your help we will collect more than 10.000 bottles out of the river and make sure they will get recycled - just like the entire PET fleet (approx. 15 thousand PET bottles). 
Bringing closer communities: by visiting villages and inviting local people to join our efforts PET Cup offers a unique opportunity to do something against the pollution. 
Public awareness: the aim of the PET Cup is to direct public attention towards the Tisza river in Eastern Europe where pollution have grown too big for us to ignore. We believe that short videos, the social media - along with feature articles and television documentaries - will spread the message through borders.

Entertaining and educating: by combining the environmental actions with a boat-race PET Cup can set up an example. How can we treat a serious environmental issue and have fun at the same time.

<p>EcoValuePoints carbon-based coupons earn you money and lower the CO2 footprint with each $ you spend. It pays to save the planet.</p>
<p>Technology alone is not going to solve the problem of global warming. It will take culture change and incentives that motivate everyone, and that can be done best with the help of commerce and industry.</p>
<p>Currently, individuals can make only small, almost symbolic efforts to lower their carbon footprint: buying a carbon offset here, buying an energy-saving product, riding a bike there. While businesses have focussed their efforts on reducing the carbon impact of their supply chains and processes, their marketing departments have no real tools that can harness their customers' desire to be ecologically effective, and most are ""greenwashing"" -- offering a veneer of ""green"" talk.</p>
<p><b>EcoValuePoints changes all that, for both consumers and businesses.</b><br/>If we succeed and create the thriving coalition of businesses and individuals we seek, we can offset the carbon footprint of a city the size of San Francisco or Boston every year -- and maybe more.</p>
<p>EcoValuePoints is the only program that pays consumers for reducing carbon emissions. It is tied to their buying habits (whether or not their purchase is ""green"").</p>
<p>We buy tons of carbon “emission credits” and offsets in bulk at auctions and remove them from markets as “permits to pollute."" We convert them into redeemable Points (coupons). Points are sold to OEM, service enterprises, and marketers (EcoSponsors) to be attached electronically to their offers to increase sales, retain customers, and to support their social responsibility missions. Points are an alternative form of currency, each worth $0.02 to the consumer, while removing two pounds of C02 from the atmosphere.</p>
<p><b>1 Point = at least $.02 AND removes 2 pounds of CO2 per dollar of retail sale</b></p>
<p>EcoSponsors can award multiple Points, for special sales and promotions. Consumers can earn, accumulate and track their EVP Points at our website, and redeem them for future savings, products, or donate their value to charity.</p>
<p><b>A Tested, Award-Winning &amp; Patented Program</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Pilot-tested at Boston University, Babson College, and Harvard Business School </li>
<li>Won a finalist position in the international MassChallenge Accelerator program (<a href=""http://www.masschallenge.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.MassChallenge.org</a>)</li>
<li>Finalist in Harvard Business School New Venture Competition</li>
<li>Granted U.S. Patent No. 8527335 for the process </li>
</ul>
<p>The EVP process is completely transparent and verifiable -- no hint of greenwashing. Every ton of offset we buy at Government regulated Cap &amp; Trade auctions has a unique serial number, and each 2-pound coupon we create can be tracked back to the original offset. In all cases, the carbon is removed from the offset market and can never be used by utilities and manufacturers exceeding pollution standards to avoid making the investments needed to clean up their dirty operations.</p>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to <br/>1) Fund the development of the database needed to manage all these tons, pounds and transactions. <br/>2) Fund the development of a world-class e-commerce website that will allow consumers and businesses to track their Points, and to post EcoSponsor offers and redemption options.<br/>3) Fund the development of mobile apps to access that website on the go.</p>
<p>Please pledge today so we can all breathe easier tomorrow!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>The technology involved in this project is the easy part. We will outsource the initial website, database, and mobile development to highly accomplished vendors in the field who have provided us with quotes, and require about six weeks to build... but this needs your funding help in the amount of $80,000. The largest challenge is building the EcoSponsor coalition to purchase our Points to promote their offers, thus expanding your redemption options beyond the existing limited network of Affiliates.</p>
<p>We have assembled a stellar team of experienced executives and marketers, and are pitching many retailers, manufacturers, service providers, and direct marketers to become EcoSponsors. While there is no guarantee of success, given the social merit of the program, the imperative to reduce carbon emissions, our successful startup track record, and our patented process, we expect to prevail.</p>
<p>We all will breathe easier because carbon will be removed for every dollar you pledge.</p>

Won a finalist position in the international MassChallenge Accelerator program (www.MassChallenge.org)
Finalist in Harvard Business School New Venture Competition
Granted U.S. Patent No. 8527335 for the process 

The EVP process is completely transparent and verifiable -- no hint of greenwashing. Every ton of offset we buy at Government regulated Cap & Trade auctions has a unique serial number, and each 2-pound coupon we create can be tracked back to the original offset. In all cases, the carbon is removed from the offset market and can never be used by utilities and manufacturers exceeding pollution standards to avoid making the investments needed to clean up their dirty operations.
The goal of this campaign is to 1) Fund the development of the database needed to manage all these tons, pounds and transactions. 2) Fund the development of a world-class e-commerce website that will allow consumers and businesses to track their Points, and to post EcoSponsor offers and redemption options.3) Fund the development of mobile apps to access that website on the go.
Please pledge today so we can all breathe easier tomorrow!

Risks and challenges
The technology involved in this project is the easy part. We will outsource the initial website, database, and mobile development to highly accomplished vendors in the field who have provided us with quotes, and require about six weeks to build... but this needs your funding help in the amount of $80,000. The largest challenge is building the EcoSponsor coalition to purchase our Points to promote their offers, thus expanding your redemption options beyond the existing limited network of Affiliates.
We have assembled a stellar team of experienced executives and marketers, and are pitching many retailers, manufacturers, service providers, and direct marketers to become EcoSponsors. While there is no guarantee of success, given the social merit of the program, the imperative to reduce carbon emissions, our successful startup track record, and our patented process, we expect to prevail.
We all will breathe easier because carbon will be removed for every dollar you pledge.

Rarely can he afford to take the bus to other towns and must either walk or hitchhike. He is one the poorest residents in our village. His wife has left him, and he is raising one boy by himself.<br/><br/>Diario's shack is delightfully breezey in summer with the all the gaps between the sticks. In Winter, however, the cracks just let in the wind and cold air. His shack does not have a proper door or windows, just tarps hung over the openings. Diario has colds and/or bronchitis most of the Winter. We give him paracetamol and cough syrup, but they are hardly a subsitute for a more substantial and warm place to live. <br/><br/>He is a simple soul with a heart of gold and a smile so big and so genuine that it warms you from head to toe. He is a very friendly guy and just loves to chat. He keeps a watchful eye on our place and alerts us immediately if anything is out of the ordinary. A dearer or more loyal friend we could not have.<br/><br/>We are uniquly qualified to build an inexpensive, natural house.  Before coming to Mexico, we built our own staw bale house and lived off the grid with solar and wind power. </strong></p>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://indiegogopics.solarhaven.org/SolarHavenPanorama1X.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>We ran weekend workshops and had a live-in internship program for two years. Our home was featured on the the ""National Solar Home Tour"" for four years. <a href=""http://solarhaven.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Our web-site,</a> which sees about 800 visitors a day, has a huge amount of do-it-yourself information on natural building techniques and renewable energy systems. <br/><br/>We were surprised when we got to Mexico to find that virtually every house in towns big and small is built with concrete blocks.  Cement is not an earth-friendly building material and takes enormous amounts of energy to produce... <br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://indiegogopics.solarhaven.org/OUCH.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>The building budget of a family here is often used up with just the cost of the blocks and the supporting concrete posts and rebar. It makes us very sad to see so many unfinished houses, usually with just the foundation and walls standing. They are everywhere -- so much time and energy and money wasted and dreams shattered.<br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://indiegogopics.solarhaven.org/Unfinished%20house,%20walls%20only%20-%20edited.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/>Building a small ""earthbag"" house for Diario will demonstrate a much less expensive and earth friendly alternative. Earthbag building is becoming common in many countries and uses free materials from the family land itself (earth) for the walls and roof. With so little cash invested in materials and with a Mexican family doing most of the work themselves, there can be more money available to finish the house with a doors and windows, plumbing and wiring. A plastered earth-bag house, with its two-foot thick walls, will withstand hurricanes and earthquakes and is far better insulated than a concrete block house. <br/><br/>By building a dome structure, there is no need for buying separate roofing materials like tin sheets. Many roofs here are flat poured-concete but they add a huge expense to building the house. They then sag, and eventually leak after a few years. Tin roofs don't insulate at all and are easily blown off in a strong wind. We don't know of a single tin roof in town that doesn't leak in a heavy rain. A dome house also provides room for installing a sleeping loft. This is a big plus for large Mexican families though the kids will probably squabble over who gets the groovy bedroom. <br/><br/>Earthbag construction lends itself to both conventional houses with vertical walls and to dome houses...</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://indiegogopics.solarhaven.org/Earth%20bag%20house.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://indiegogopics.solarhaven.org/Kelly%20Harts%20place.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 4px; margin-right: 4px;""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>A conventional house is most suited to Diario's land which is long and narrow.<br/><br/>An earth bag home is constructed from bags filled with earth from land on or near the proposed house or in the case of our project with the local “gravel” which is a lightweight volcanic rock called “scoria”. Because of the countless air pockets in the gravel, an earthbag house built with scoria has the very high insulation value (R-45), equivalent in fact to a straw bale house! </strong></p>
<p> <strong>With </strong><strong>double-strands of barbed wire laid between the courses to stabilize them, </strong><strong><strong><strong>each course well tamped, an</strong></strong>d a heavy finish coat of plaster to cover the walls and roof... </strong></p>

<p>  <strong>... the resulting house is strong, energy efficient, and uses much less of the earth's resources to make.  It is much more likely to be finished given the limited financial resources of our neighbors and is the kind of construction virtually everybody in the family can lend a hand with.<br/><br/>The main expenses for this project house are:<br/><br/>- two large dump-truck loads of scoria gravel<br/>- 2 rolls of barbed-wire<br/>- gunny sacks from the local feed store<br/>- custom-welded heavy iron tamping tools (2)<br/>- 20 sacks of lime for plastering<br/>- dump truck load of sand, also for plastering<br/>- windows and a door<br/>- electrical supplies<br/>- plumbing supplies<br/>- wages for four locals for two months:  to build the foundation, to fill the bags, stack up courses of bags and tamp them, to lay out double strands of barbed-wire between courses, to set in the doors and windows in place, and to plaster both the inside and outside of the house.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Please help fund this earth-bag house for Diario. You will be giving him a house he badly needs and one he never dreamed he could have. You will be giving him a house we think he truly deserves. <br/><br/>AND you will be helping our neighbors see for themselves that there really IS a way to build a great little house of their own and not run out of money before finishing it.  Ideas don't make much of an impression on the local folks. They must SEE it and experience it -- find out the walls really won't fall down and in fact are hell-for-stout and find out that it really is cool inside an earthbag house while all the other houses in town are not.  They will learn that we built the place for way less than any other house in town. Perhaps they may have even gotten curious and helped us fill and stack a bag or two and realized how easy it is.</strong></p>

<p><strong>An earthbag house is far stronger and would still be standing.</strong></p>
<p><strong>There is no reason to continue building houses with expensive concrete blocks which require so much energy to produce and are so destructive to the environment -- not when there is still earth and gravel and sand to be used instead and many hands available to do the work. An earthbag house just makes sense for the needs of the people of Mexico, for the environmental needs of our planet, and of course for our dear neighbor Diario.<br/><br/>Here are kids at Project Somos in Guatemala where a large earthbag center has recently been completed for abandoned or orphaned children.<br/><br/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://indiegogopics.solarhaven.org/Childrens%20village%20in%20Ghuatmala.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;""/><br/><br/></strong></p>

He says he has always wanted to visit Mexico and over the years has gradually taught himself to speak Spanish. He has now created a sizable web site devoted to tips on how to learn Spanish (<a href=""http://www.alwaysspanish.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.alwaysspanish.com</a>).  He will be taking primary responsibility for supervising the local workers as they respond so much better to taking directions from a male, and his superior Spanish will come in mighty handy.

Diario has colds and/or bronchitis most of the Winter. We give him paracetamol and cough syrup, but they are hardly a subsitute for a more substantial and warm place to live. He is a simple soul with a heart of gold and a smile so big and so genuine that it warms you from head to toe. He is a very friendly guy and just loves to chat. He keeps a watchful eye on our place and alerts us immediately if anything is out of the ordinary. A dearer or more loyal friend we could not have.We are uniquly qualified to build an inexpensive, natural house.  Before coming to Mexico, we built our own staw bale house and lived off the grid with solar and wind power. 

We ran weekend workshops and had a live-in internship program for two years. Our home was featured on the the ""National Solar Home Tour"" for four years. Our web-site, which sees about 800 visitors a day, has a huge amount of do-it-yourself information on natural building techniques and renewable energy systems. We were surprised when we got to Mexico to find that virtually every house in towns big and small is built with concrete blocks.  Cement is not an earth-friendly building material and takes enormous amounts of energy to produce... The building budget of a family here is often used up with just the cost of the blocks and the supporting concrete posts and rebar. It makes us very sad to see so many unfinished houses, usually with just the foundation and walls standing. They are everywhere -- so much time and energy and money wasted and dreams shattered.Building a small ""earthbag"" house for Diario will demonstrate a much less expensive and earth friendly alternative. Earthbag building is becoming common in many countries and uses free materials from the family land itself (earth) for the walls and roof. With so little cash invested in materials and with a Mexican family doing most of the work themselves, there can be more money available to finish the house with a doors and windows, plumbing and wiring. A plastered earth-bag house, with its two-foot thick walls, will withstand hurricanes and earthquakes and is far better insulated than a concrete block house. By building a dome structure, there is no need for buying separate roofing materials like tin sheets. Many roofs here are flat poured-concete but they add a huge expense to building the house. They then sag, and eventually leak after a few years. Tin roofs don't insulate at all and are easily blown off in a strong wind. We don't know of a single tin roof in town that doesn't leak in a heavy rain. A dome house also provides room for installing a sleeping loft. This is a big plus for large Mexican families though the kids will probably squabble over who gets the groovy bedroom. Earthbag construction lends itself to both conventional houses with vertical walls and to dome houses...

A conventional house is most suited to Diario's land which is long and narrow.An earth bag home is constructed from bags filled with earth from land on or near the proposed house or in the case of our project with the local “gravel” which is a lightweight volcanic rock called “scoria”. Because of the countless air pockets in the gravel, an earthbag house built with scoria has the very high insulation value (R-45), equivalent in fact to a straw bale house! 
 With double-strands of barbed wire laid between the courses to stabilize them, each course well tamped, and a heavy finish coat of plaster to cover the walls and roof... 

  ... the resulting house is strong, energy efficient, and uses much less of the earth's resources to make.  It is much more likely to be finished given the limited financial resources of our neighbors and is the kind of construction virtually everybody in the family can lend a hand with.The main expenses for this project house are:- two large dump-truck loads of scoria gravel- 2 rolls of barbed-wire- gunny sacks from the local feed store- custom-welded heavy iron tamping tools (2)- 20 sacks of lime for plastering- dump truck load of sand, also for plastering- windows and a door- electrical supplies- plumbing supplies- wages for four locals for two months:  to build the foundation, to fill the bags, stack up courses of bags and tamp them, to lay out double strands of barbed-wire between courses, to set in the doors and windows in place, and to plaster both the inside and outside of the house.
 
While Jim is partially disabled now and can not assist with the physical labor of filling earthbags, he is an able organizer, supervisor, correspondent, writer, videographer, and web designer. Mindy, having worked for seven years building Solar Haven in the U.S. is experienced in carpentry, plumbing, electrical work, and plastering. 
Please help fund this earth-bag house for Diario. You will be giving him a house he badly needs and one he never dreamed he could have. You will be giving him a house we think he truly deserves. AND you will be helping our neighbors see for themselves that there really IS a way to build a great little house of their own and not run out of money before finishing it.  Ideas don't make much of an impression on the local folks. They must SEE it and experience it -- find out the walls really won't fall down and in fact are hell-for-stout and find out that it really is cool inside an earthbag house while all the other houses in town are not.  They will learn that we built the place for way less than any other house in town. Perhaps they may have even gotten curious and helped us fill and stack a bag or two and realized how easy it is.
We should mention that Hurricane Karl two years ago took down concrete block houses that were poorly constructed and, in fact, removed all or part of every tin roof in our village including Diario's of course.
An earthbag house is far stronger and would still be standing.
There is no reason to continue building houses with expensive concrete blocks which require so much energy to produce and are so destructive to the environment -- not when there is still earth and gravel and sand to be used instead and many hands available to do the work. An earthbag house just makes sense for the needs of the people of Mexico, for the environmental needs of our planet, and of course for our dear neighbor Diario.Here are kids at Project Somos in Guatemala where a large earthbag center has recently been completed for abandoned or orphaned children.
""THE PROJECT TEAM""
 JIM AND MINDY PHYPERS
 Long before Jim and Mindy married 31 years ago, they both loved animals and wild places, exploring and hiking. Through out their marriage they dreamed of living simply and self-sufficiently and as close to the natural world as possible. Out on four remote acres in the desert of Arizona and then in the mountains of Veracruz, Mexico they got their chance and have dedicated themselves to living sustainably and trying to guide others to do the same.
 AMIT SCHANDILLIA
 Amit currently lives in Mumbai, India. He will be joining us soon as our first SolarHaven2 intern. This is an un-paid, six-month volunteer position, but we provide all meals and lodging.  He is very eager to get started with building the earthbag demonstration house and help us install the first componets of our solar electric system. He says he has always wanted to visit Mexico and over the years has gradually taught himself to speak Spanish. He has now created a sizable web site devoted to tips on how to learn Spanish (www.alwaysspanish.com).  He will be taking primary responsibility for supervising the local workers as they respond so much better to taking directions from a male, and his superior Spanish will come in mighty handy. He is hoping to take what he will learn about earthbag building back to India and become involved in a similar project there.  
 RODRIGO COOPER 
 Rodrigo presently lives in Portland, Oregon but until recently lived in Veracruz, Mexico for 19 years and ran a free medical clinic in another small mountain town in our area. While he needs to remain in the U.S. now for medical reasons, his heart is still in Mexico. He is like a brother to Jim and is 1000% behind the goals for SolarHaven2. He is an absolutely invaluable resource for everything about the Latino culture and to help us determine the best ways to approach our neighbors with our admittedly radical ideas. Once the earthbag project is underway, he plans to visit for awhile and ""start barking orders"" as he put it. These will be most welcome, however, as Rodrigo has a life-time of building experience.

IF WE EXCEED OUR PROJECT GOAL OF $6500: 

First we want to buy Diario some furniture. He has only two matts on the floor for he and his son at present. Outside there is a small table to prepare food on and a fire-pit. 
Then we would like to introduce simple efficient ""rocket stoves"" in our village and place one in as many homes as funds permit. Right now everyone wastes large amounts of wood cooking in an open fire-box. Many hours a week are spent scrounging for it. Housewives scour the hills locally while the men go far out into the countryside with their burros (or mules) to cut wood and haul it home.
  The wood is burned in an open elevated firebox with bricks at the side to support a grill and cooking pots. Much of the heat goes out, not up, and wastes much firewood. 
   A rocket stove is a simple device to direct the heat of a fire directly to the cooking pots. They also burn the wood more completely with less smoke and ashes. Less smoke means healthier families and clearer air. They are very inexpensive to make.
Far less wood is required for cooking which translates into less time collecting firewood and more family time. It also means fewer trees cut down and burned and thus less denuding of the forest cover. We must mention that deforestation was one of the main reasons for the collapse of the Mayan civilization as well as that of the Anasazi people and the Easter Islanders. (see: ""Collapse: How societies choose to fail or succeed"" by Jared Diamond, 2005).
There is a big job for us to do in our village but we can't do it without your help!!

The Sanctuary is an exceptional model for preserving Sacred lands for the purposes of spiritual transformation and ecological preservation.
The Sacred Land Sanctuary is unquestionably beautiful. And while all land is inherently sacred, the Sanctuary's 200+ acres holds a history that goes back to the Ancients. Evidence shows that native peoples utilized this land for meditation, wilderness quests, and spiritual transformation -- exactly what the Way of Nature Fellowship programs founded by the world-renowned environmentalist and spiritual teacher John P. Milton aim to provide to modern people.
Help us pay off the loan on the land so that the Sacred Land Sanctuary can continue to be used to expand consciousness and support spiritual growth and transformation!

What We Need & What You Get

$80,000 is needed to prevent the loan from defaulting by December 1st, 2013!

Perks include fine art photography, energetic essences, energy work sessions, and a range of Way of Nature Trainings and Passages!

Even if we don't reach our entire goal, we plan to use the funds as a payment on the loan in good faith that our continued fundraising efforts will be enough to pay off the entire balloon payment. 

Any funds over the loan amount will be used to purchase an adjoining parcel and to improve infrastructure on the land including repairs on the rustic care-taker cabin, a kiva for dark retreat and placing boundary flags to facilitate continuity with the community.

PROJECT 
ADOPT A
MEDICINAL PLANT!
OFFICIAL CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN FOR THE REALIZATION OF “AMARUMAYO” ETHNOBOTANIC RESERVATION IN
SOUTH EAST PERUVIAN AMAZONIA, AIMING AT PROMOTING THE SAFEGUARD OF LOCAL MEDICAL CULTURE
AND LOCAL POPULATION. 
Amarumayo is a project
that safeguards and promotes traditional Amazonian medicine and its related
human and natural environment that is nowadays considered as an extraordinary
example of cultural and natural setting at the highest risk of destruction. ITALIANOESPAÑOLWho we are. Etnopharmakon is a no profit organization with legal residence in Busto Arsizio (Italia) and in Calafell (Spain), born at the beginning of 2014 with the aim to preserve and promote practices deriving from traditional and unconventional medicine and people's cultures bounded to them, through environmental conservation projects, research, education, information.
Amarumayo (literally
“snakes river”) is the name given by Inca people to the river “Madre de Dios”,
that gives the name also to the whole region of south east Peru, close to
Brazil and Bolivia border. 
Nowadays the “Madre de Dios” is one of the
places in the world with the higher biodiversity level but it is also a region
with the highest rate of environmental risk that turns into cultural emergency
because in this place culture and nature are strongly connected. The link
between nature and culture is particularly clear in traditional medical
practices, based on the use of unique local plants. 
In the last years, the irresponsible and
indiscriminate depletion of local resources – first of all wood and gold – has
been becoming a devastation that is irreparably compromising the amazing
biological equilibrium and the humane culture that is manifestation and example
of harmonious bond between man and nature in this place. 
Our aim is to give back to this desecrated
land its dignity, protecting and valuing its amazing human, cultural and
environmental richness. Adopting a plant you can help
us at build the “AMARUMAYO RESERVATION”, around 5 hectares ethnobotanic
protected garden located in the namesake region of Perù, near the city of Puerto Maldonado.
Amarumayo will be a
safe area where grow plants to be employed in traditional medicine practices
meanwhile giving to the new local generation the possibility of rediscover and
strengthen their cultural identity through formative projects aiming at leading
young people to the knowledge
and awareness of their culture conceived not only as a richness of the past but
also as a strength with a great value in modern life.
Local curanderos of verify
reliability will take care of the garden and of the plants that will be used
for their practices, giving to other people the possibility of knowing this way
of “taking care” based on a deep knowledge of human beings in their connection
with natural environment. 
“Adoption of a plant” means: 
•                  
contribute to the safeguard of Amazon forest 
•                  
protect an ancient knowledge of natural
therapeutic practices 
•                  
contribute to the fight against indiscriminate
depletion of human and natural resources (in this area the traffic of human
beings , particularly children, is very widespread) 
•                  
take a concrete action against human rights
disregard 
•                  
create an example of “virtuous circle”
promoting social economic and cultural self determination 
•                  
Be active part involved in the project, not
only a passive viewer 
 
Thanks to your contribution we will manage to: First goal: 55% of the funds raised
•                  
buy the
land (about 2,000$ for hectare, 10,000$ for 5 hectares, if we do not reach the full amount we start buying less land )•                 create gardening spaces freely used by local approved curanderos for their practices •                 create the ethnobotanic gardenSecond goal:25% of the funds raised
•                  
create a covered garden for storage of
necessary tools and to guest the beneficiaries of projects of training,
information and research that will be enhanced both al local and global level. (1,500$ for a maloca; 4,000$ for dormitories, kitchen, bathrooms, tambos, storage plants)
•                  Support a continuous campaign of information,
research and rising awareness.

<p>Hi all.  Ok, we’re now into the final campaign push to fund this project. With the money pledged up to now I started production several weeks ago .... here’s what I’ve come up with so far:</p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F7hTPmKe7FYk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D7hTPmKe7FYk&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F7hTPmKe7FYk%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>Remember that this is still a <b>work in progress</b> and there are still changes to be made (for example: the music is still tentative). A key concern from feedback received up to now has been “<i>it sounds too good to be true</i>” ... <i>“what’s the catch?"" </i> To address this issue I’m going to need slightly more funding to cover travel costs for going to Phoenix and videotaping the prototype METROL equipment in successful operation. </p>
<p>Another concern has been that if the promise of Metrol is so great, <i>why isn’t there already abundant seed-money investment available for it?</i>  While I can’t go into details on this, it should be said that there are specific reasons why METROL has been ‘under the radar’ ... and that this situation is fortunately about to change.</p><b>Project Overview</b><div>
<br/><p>We're at a turning point in history. Growing numbers of people are feeling frustrated and anxious about escalating climate change (CC), but feel powerless do anything about it.  At the same time, clean, sustainable, and now <b>affordable</b> <i>'fossil-fuel-replacement'  </i>technologies have emerged that could make a major impact on the CC problem and are ready to go, but—for a variety of reasons—remain relatively unknown and unused. </p>
<p>One particularly intriguing new development—and one that very few know about—is a hydrogen-based liquid fuel for cars and trucks called <b>Metrol</b> that does not require fossil fuels, but can instead be made in massive amounts from garbage, sewage, farm waste, forest waste ... as well as from solar &amp; wind energy. Unlike other hydrogen fuels that require high pressure or extreme refrigeration, Metrol is a liquid at room temperature and can thus utilize existing gasoline and diesel-fuel infrastructure: ...i.e. tanker trucks, existing gas stations, pipelines, and standard vehicle gas tanks.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459611521/textBox_AvoidInfrastructure2_igksdc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Metrol is different from other biofuels.  Instead of simply extracting methane (CH4)  from biomass and then burning it as a fuel, the making of Metrol goes one critical step further:<p><b><i>      — the methane is separated into solid CARBON and pure HYDROGEN— </i></b></p>
<p>The carbon can then be sold to industry for large profits to make revolutionary new carbon-based manufacturing materials that are stronger than steel and lighter than aluminum. The gaseous hydrogen is combined with nitrogen and carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to make a liquid fuel that's easy to handle, transport, and store in a standard internal-combustion-engine (ICE) car.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>Once the liquid Metrol is inside a car—and after leaving the gas tank—the mixture is vaporized and pressurized utilizing waste heat from the engine. The hydrogen is then typically separated out from the carbon dioxide and the nitrogen (which return to the atmosphere from where they originated) so that the engine itself is typically burning only pure hydrogen, which is much cleaner than burning methane.  A car running on Metrol actually cleans the air that it drives through by capturing nitrous oxide (a key component of smog) from its intake air.  Fortunately, only minor changes are required to convert a standard ICE car (of which there are now over 1.2 billion in the world) so that it can burn Metrol.  Even better, that car could still run on gasoline if Metrol wasn't yet locally available.</p>

What We Need & What You Get
The production budget of $12,000 covers mostly labor costs involved in both scriptwriting (instructional design & testing) as well as media production ( planning, 3-D modeling; 2-D & 3-D animation; live action videography, post production, and soundtrack design).
For each level of contribution, donors will receive a ‘perk’ that is proportionate in value to their donation. Such perks range from customized postcards, posters, and tee-shirts to—on the high end—opportunities to appear in the film production itself.
The Impact


The most important use of the video will be for investor presentations to raise funds for the next key step in bringing METROL to market: .... the conducting and paying for exhaustive 3rd-party field testing of the METROL system to prove its reliability.The finished piece will also be used for internet video, science-museum exhibits, and possibly television.  It will additionally be incorporated into a feature-length documentary film now in production called  “Keys to the Cage”  by Michael Henning (director of ""Hempsters; Plant the Seed”) that chronicles  the now-in-progress emergence of the hydrogen economy.
In all cases, when people see, from my short  film, the unique practical, environmental, and economic benefits of using METROL, they’ll likely do one or more of the following: 
(a) realize for the first time that phasing off of fossil fuel is not an impossible task; (b) begin talking with friends, colleagues, and public officials about developing and encouraging Metrol infrastructure; (c) invest in businesses devoted to supporting Metrol use; (d) have their own car converted to Metrol;
Ideally this all leads to a groundswell movement and  ‘tipping-point’ phenomenon suitable in scale for effectively altering the course of climate change. When we as a society genuinely believe that something like this can realistically happen, it can.
Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge is being clever and persuasive enough on the instructional design to motivate action that overcomes the considerable ‘inertia’ (resistance to change) that exists in our society around energy use and motor-vehicle use. The biggest risk is not collecting enough funding to do the animated film project justice.

<hr/><p>
</p><h2>Our Story</h2>
<p><a href=""http://rawbotanicals.com/join-the-refill-movement"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Raw Botanicals</a> is a 12-year-old company, born in Costa Rica.
We produce high quality, organic and natural amenities and cosmetics that are
used by individuals, spas and hotels around the world.</p>
<p><span style="""">An Eye Opening Challenge…</span><br/></p>
<p>As the company grew, we were approached by hotels
interested in using Raw Botanicals organic amenities  - soap, shampoo and conditioner – for their
clients. Always up for a challenge, we soon discovered, with
horror, what was taking place in the hotel industry in Costa Rica – a country
known for its environmental preservation and heritage. Hotels were buying tiny
(2 oz) plastic bottles of bathroom amenities for their guests and then simply
throwing them away.</p>
<p>It wasn’t hard to do the math: <b>one 150-room hotel could
expect to use 400 or more of these bottles every day. That’s over 150,000
bottles every year, in just one hotel! And, Costa Rica has almost 1000 hotels.</b>
The waste was staggering.</p>
<p>Acting upon the company’s commitment to the environment,
we set out to change things. We created a simple, attractive and cost-saving dispenser system for bathrooms that can be refilled again and again. Now,

<p>With the success of the hotel refill system and its impact
on the problem of waste from plastic bottles, we saw an opportunity
to massively increase the breadth and depth of this impact by providing
individuals with a similar system for use in their homes.</p><p>
</p><hr/><h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>We’ve designed Raw Botanicals Refill System with our <a href=""http://www.rawbotanicals.com/product/papaya-tangerine-body-wash/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Papaya Tangerine Body Wash </a>to ensure it
saves time and money, and reduces waste from plastic bottles.</p>
<h3>A better use of your time and money.</h3>
<p>Everyone uses products like body wash, shampoo and
conditioner everyday. It’s not uncommon for these products
to run out quickly (the average person goes through a 10 oz bottle of body wash
in 30 days). And, for those of us who insist upon natural and organic products,
its no secret these products can be expensive!</p>
<p>The Refill System saves you time by eliminating the need to
go to the store to purchase more. Simply refill the bottles you use in just a
few seconds at home. Also, because the Refill System provides high quality, natural and
organic products in bulk quantities, there is a significant cost savings.</p>
<h3>Reducing waste from plastic bottles.</h3>
<p>Our true passion for the Refill System comes from its
ability to empower YOU to have real, substantial impact on the waste created
from plastic bottles, without leaving your home.</p>

<p>The bottles provided with the Refill System have a life span
of more than three years. By refilling these bottles, we’re giving individuals
a simple and easy way to keep 1000s of bottles out of recycle bins, landfills (or worse –
oceans, rivers and habitats!). Just consider the waste created from body wash

The Raw Botanicals Refill System empowers YOU to create
change in the world.
How? The Refill System provides you with a simple, effective
and money-saving way to refill body products at home, helping reduce the number of plastic bottles that pollute
oceans and rivers, fill up garbage dumps and destroy habitats.
Stop Recycling. Start Refilling.
The Raw Botanicals Refill System is more than just natural,
organic bathroom amenities. It’s a system designed to empower individuals with
a simple, effective and money-saving method for reducing waste from plastic
bottles.


Our Story
Raw Botanicals is a 12-year-old company, born in Costa Rica.
We produce high quality, organic and natural amenities and cosmetics that are
used by individuals, spas and hotels around the world.
An Eye Opening Challenge…
As the company grew, we were approached by hotels
interested in using Raw Botanicals organic amenities  - soap, shampoo and conditioner – for their
clients. Always up for a challenge, we soon discovered, with
horror, what was taking place in the hotel industry in Costa Rica – a country
known for its environmental preservation and heritage. Hotels were buying tiny
(2 oz) plastic bottles of bathroom amenities for their guests and then simply
throwing them away.
It wasn’t hard to do the math: one 150-room hotel could
expect to use 400 or more of these bottles every day. That’s over 150,000
bottles every year, in just one hotel! And, Costa Rica has almost 1000 hotels.
The waste was staggering.
Acting upon the company’s commitment to the environment,
we set out to change things. We created a simple, attractive and cost-saving dispenser system for bathrooms that can be refilled again and again. Now,
hotels in Costa Rica use this refill method as a way to provide a high quality
experience, save money, and protect the environment.

But don't take our word for it - check out this video featuring one of our luxury villa clients here in Costa Rica:The Next Step…

This is a <i>positive</i> story, making positive change in a revolutionary way -- combining tradition with science.   Learn more about us and our affiliations below, and read on to learn about and support this effort!</p><p>As many of us know, coral reefs around the world are suffering declines.  But what many of us don't often think about is that traditional cultures, which have been stewards of many of these systems for centuries, are also in peril.  And that's part of the problem. People and their environment are intimately linked, especially in places where people depend on their immediate environment everyday -- for everything from building materials to daily sustenance.  In the Micronesian outer islands, climate change, overfishing (not commercial fishing, we are really dealing with subsistence fishing), and cultural change (much of it initiated during and following World War II, are having negative effects.  Yet the reefs we have looked at in this region are relatively healthy (Yap state), which gives us all an excellent starting place.  So what's going on?  In a nutshell:</p><p>1.  Reefs are beginning to stress due to climate change as well as local impacts.</p><p>2.  People are still only subsistence fishing, and overall population has not increased much, but what used to be over 70 different kinds of fishing has been reduced to far fewer methods, including some new ones, such as night spearfishing, newer nets, motor boats etc.  This is increasing impact on fewer fish types.  Loss of diverse methods is leading to loss of diversity (and abundance) of fish.  On stressed reefs, this leads to problems.</p><p>3.  Overfishing of some fish, such as parrotfish (e.g.. from night spearfishing), is leading to negative ecological impacts -- parrotfish eat algae (a good thing for reefs), and with fewer parrotfish, algae starts to overgrow reefs, leading to larger declines.  A sort of downward spiral.</p><p>4.  Some traditional management, which has been effective for years, has either been lost, or is not being enforced, or has not been adapted to the changing times.</p><p>5. The people of the outer islands have a tremendous amount of knowledge about their reefs and how to manage them, they just need assistance with how to adapt that to these rapidly changing times.  We help provide knowledge about the reefs, and the impacts of fishing and other problems, and they can develop the management plans.  And they are.  And it is working.</p><p>We are combining science and tradition to achieve sustainable ocean management.</p><p></p><p><b><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/533821/files/20140425125739-P7040683.JPG?1398455859"" src="""" style=""""/></b><br/></b></p><p><b>The key</b></p><p>Outer islanders have been sustainably managing their oceans for centuries, probably millennia.  Part of their success lies in the unique governance structure they still have today -- they are autonomously (self) governed.  They make their own decisions, community by community with their own councils.  They can implement management immediately if they need to, and each community can adopt a plan that is unique to their needs and environmental context.  In addition, they have a deep historical knowledge of management and traditions that have protected their ocean resources over time.  Currently, a loss of tradition combined with introduction of new and more impactful fishing methods, and the effects of climate change, are creating an imbalance leading to declines.  The key is their knowledge, which can be revived, new knowledge which we can help provide, and their governance, which allows them to implement adaptive management NOW.</p><p></p><h3>Some background</h3><p> There are many ways to approach conservation and management.  Yet the vast majority of efforts focus on only a few methods.  We are doing it differently -- letting communities lead, and focusing on combining tradition with modern science. In 2010, recognizing a decline in reef health and fish populations, islanders from the remote Micronesian
outer islands of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulithi"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ulithi Atoll</a>, Yap State realized that their health,
their communities, and their future were being threatened by rapid
environmental and cultural change.  They
asked for help to learn how to manage a sustainable food supply from their oceans, a critical
issue for their present and future wellbeing. 
We are a team of scientists who came together to respond to the
islanders' call for assistance.  This project is realizing unprecedented success.  You can learn
more about us and read our reports at: <a href=""onepeopleonereef.ucsc.edu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">onepeopleonereef.ucsc.edu</a></p><p></p><p>Other organizations that have been instrumental include the <a href=""http://www.oceanicsociety.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Oceanic Society</a> (also organizes natural history and research expeditions to Ulithi and other places) and <a href=""http://www.bluecology.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Bluecology</a> (works with Pacific Islanders with a special interest in students), <a href=""http://www.cfr-west.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">and CFR-West</a> (organizes collaborative fisheries programs).  Our program follows another successful conservation effort on Ulithi, the Ulithi Marine Turtle Project (learn about this on our website).</p><p><b></b></p><h3><b></b></h3><p><b></b></p><b></b><p><b><b></b></b></p><p><b><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/533837/files/20140425130257-teachingaboutfish.JPG?1398456177"" src="""" style=""""/></b></b></p><p><b>A unique approach</b></p><p>We are doing things differently.  Our project has both a reef ecology as well as a social science component.  We talk extensively with people from all demographics and roles in the community to better assess the nature of fish and reef declines (including changes in fishing practices), historical context, and the role that traditions -- and the loss of them -- may play.   We also conduct extensive ecological surveys of the reefs, and share what we find with the communities.  We discuss specific findings, such as the link between parrotfish declines, night spearfishing, and algal overgrowth on reefs and how traditional management could address this.  We are encouraging both a reconnection to traditional ways, as well as an embracing of modern techniques -- such as motor boats (rather than abandoning them which is not practical) to address problems in resource abundance and reef health.  This project is achieving rapid success and support.   Our task is to listen to, learn from, and provide information to the islanders so they can make their own decisions, not to push any outside agenda or to represent external interests. We need funds to expand this project across the Caroline archipelago to additional outer islands in Yap state -- at their request.  Word of the project is spreading fast, and the people are requesting assistance.</p><h3><b>Who we are</b></h3><p></p><p>We are a team of dedicated scientists and community leaders, coming together with outer island people to effect positive change in how their marine systems are managed, their way.</p><p>I am Nicole Crane, one of the project leaders.  My own childhood growing up overseas in developing countries (my parents were with USAID and world hunger), and on sailboats, gave me a love of the sea, and also an appreciation of the importance of cultural diversity and traditional knowledge.  My science background has given me the tools to better understand our Planet's marine systems, and the impacts that are altering them today.  My background has also helped me understand the critical link between traditional knowledge and environmental sustainability -- a key to effective management for many communities.  </p><p>John Rulmal Jr. is also a project leader, community leader, and organizer from Ulithi Atoll (Yap outer islands).  He is helping to make this project a success in the outer islands -- uniting communities around tradition and management.  He engages Chiefs, Leaders and community members to come together around this central issue -- maintaining sustainable food supplies by ensuring healthy reefs and fish populations.  <i>Hofag (Unity)!</i></p><p><b>Our team of scientists and organizers consists of</b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/533799/files/20140425125136-P7080376.JPG?1398455496"" src="""" style=""""/></p>From right to left above:<p></p><p>Nicole Crane, Oceanic Society and Cabrillo College - reef ecology and community engagement</p><p>Dr. Giacomo Bernardi, University of California Santa Cruz - fish genetics and diversity</p><p>Dr. Peter Nelson, Collaborative Fisheries Research West - community-based fisheries management and fish ecology<br/></p><p>Dr. Michelle Paddack, Oceanic Society and Santa Barbara City College - reef ecology and herbivorous fish dynamics<br/></p><p>Dr. Avigdor Abelson, Tel Aviv University - coral reef ecology and restoration</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/533803/files/20140425125258-nicoleandjunior.jpg?1398455578"" src="""" style=""width: 574.6666666666666px;

This is a positive story, making positive change in a revolutionary way -- combining tradition with science.   Learn more about us and our affiliations below, and read on to learn about and support this effort!As many of us know, coral reefs around the world are suffering declines.  But what many of us don't often think about is that traditional cultures, which have been stewards of many of these systems for centuries, are also in peril.  And that's part of the problem. People and their environment are intimately linked, especially in places where people depend on their immediate environment everyday -- for everything from building materials to daily sustenance.  In the Micronesian outer islands, climate change, overfishing (not commercial fishing, we are really dealing with subsistence fishing), and cultural change (much of it initiated during and following World War II, are having negative effects.  Yet the reefs we have looked at in this region are relatively healthy (Yap state), which gives us all an excellent starting place.  So what's going on?  In a nutshell:1.  Reefs are beginning to stress due to climate change as well as local impacts.2.  People are still only subsistence fishing, and overall population has not increased much, but what used to be over 70 different kinds of fishing has been reduced to far fewer methods, including some new ones, such as night spearfishing, newer nets, motor boats etc.  This is increasing impact on fewer fish types.  Loss of diverse methods is leading to loss of diversity (and abundance) of fish.  On stressed reefs, this leads to problems.3.  Overfishing of some fish, such as parrotfish (e.g.. from night spearfishing), is leading to negative ecological impacts -- parrotfish eat algae (a good thing for reefs), and with fewer parrotfish, algae starts to overgrow reefs, leading to larger declines.  A sort of downward spiral.4.  Some traditional management, which has been effective for years, has either been lost, or is not being enforced, or has not been adapted to the changing times.5. The people of the outer islands have a tremendous amount of knowledge about their reefs and how to manage them, they just need assistance with how to adapt that to these rapidly changing times.  We help provide knowledge about the reefs, and the impacts of fishing and other problems, and they can develop the management plans.  And they are.  And it is working.We are combining science and tradition to achieve sustainable ocean management.The keyOuter islanders have been sustainably managing their oceans for centuries, probably millennia.  Part of their success lies in the unique governance structure they still have today -- they are autonomously (self) governed.  They make their own decisions, community by community with their own councils.  They can implement management immediately if they need to, and each community can adopt a plan that is unique to their needs and environmental context.  In addition, they have a deep historical knowledge of management and traditions that have protected their ocean resources over time.  Currently, a loss of tradition combined with introduction of new and more impactful fishing methods, and the effects of climate change, are creating an imbalance leading to declines.  The key is their knowledge, which can be revived, new knowledge which we can help provide, and their governance, which allows them to implement adaptive management NOW.Some background There are many ways to approach conservation and management.  Yet the vast majority of efforts focus on only a few methods.  We are doing it differently -- letting communities lead, and focusing on combining tradition with modern science. In 2010, recognizing a decline in reef health and fish populations, islanders from the remote Micronesian
outer islands of Ulithi Atoll, Yap State realized that their health,
their communities, and their future were being threatened by rapid
environmental and cultural change.  They
asked for help to learn how to manage a sustainable food supply from their oceans, a critical
issue for their present and future wellbeing. 
We are a team of scientists who came together to respond to the
islanders' call for assistance.  This project is realizing unprecedented success.  You can learn
more about us and read our reports at: onepeopleonereef.ucsc.eduOther organizations that have been instrumental include the Oceanic Society (also organizes natural history and research expeditions to Ulithi and other places) and Bluecology (works with Pacific Islanders with a special interest in students), and CFR-West (organizes collaborative fisheries programs).  Our program follows another successful conservation effort on Ulithi, the Ulithi Marine Turtle Project (learn about this on our website).A unique approachWe are doing things differently.  Our project has both a reef ecology as well as a social science component.  We talk extensively with people from all demographics and roles in the community to better assess the nature of fish and reef declines (including changes in fishing practices), historical context, and the role that traditions -- and the loss of them -- may play.   We also conduct extensive ecological surveys of the reefs, and share what we find with the communities.  We discuss specific findings, such as the link between parrotfish declines, night spearfishing, and algal overgrowth on reefs and how traditional management could address this.  We are encouraging both a reconnection to traditional ways, as well as an embracing of modern techniques -- such as motor boats (rather than abandoning them which is not practical) to address problems in resource abundance and reef health.  This project is achieving rapid success and support.   Our task is to listen to, learn from, and provide information to the islanders so they can make their own decisions, not to push any outside agenda or to represent external interests. We need funds to expand this project across the Caroline archipelago to additional outer islands in Yap state -- at their request.  Word of the project is spreading fast, and the people are requesting assistance.Who we areWe are a team of dedicated scientists and community leaders, coming together with outer island people to effect positive change in how their marine systems are managed, their way.I am Nicole Crane, one of the project leaders.  My own childhood growing up overseas in developing countries (my parents were with USAID and world hunger), and on sailboats, gave me a love of the sea, and also an appreciation of the importance of cultural diversity and traditional knowledge.  My science background has given me the tools to better understand our Planet's marine systems, and the impacts that are altering them today.  My background has also helped me understand the critical link between traditional knowledge and environmental sustainability -- a key to effective management for many communities.  John Rulmal Jr. is also a project leader, community leader, and organizer from Ulithi Atoll (Yap outer islands).  He is helping to make this project a success in the outer islands -- uniting communities around tradition and management.  He engages Chiefs, Leaders and community members to come together around this central issue -- maintaining sustainable food supplies by ensuring healthy reefs and fish populations.  Hofag (Unity)!Our team of scientists and organizers consists ofFrom right to left above:Nicole Crane, Oceanic Society and Cabrillo College - reef ecology and community engagementDr. Giacomo Bernardi, University of California Santa Cruz - fish genetics and diversityDr. Peter Nelson, Collaborative Fisheries Research West - community-based fisheries management and fish ecologyDr. Michelle Paddack, Oceanic Society and Santa Barbara City College - reef ecology and herbivorous fish dynamicsDr. Avigdor Abelson, Tel Aviv University - coral reef ecology and restorationLeft above is John Rulmal, Jr., Ulithi Falalop Community Action Program, Ulithi Atoll, FSM - community liaison, local project management, community activator!Affiliated scientists Kristin Precoda, statistician (Oceanic Society), and Sara Cannon, undergraduate student (University of California Santa Cruz), and Dr. Steve Moore (ecology robotics, and instrumentation)Kelsey Doyle produced our video!  Kelsey Doyle (Hawks Peak Productions) is a documentary filmmaker and journalist from Santa Cruz,

(below from left to right, Basco-Asor Island, Alex-Falalop Island and Mario-Mog Mog Island)What your support will help achieveWe have successfully worked with communities on Ulithi Atoll (the 4th largest atoll in the world).  Your support will help move this project out across the other outer islands.  It will help us conduct a workshop this summer where we will bring together representatives from across the outer islands to help develop management plans and share knowledge about reef ecology and fish life histories.  They are asking for this.Your funds will contribute to an effort that will enhance conservation, sustainability, and livelihoods across a vast area of the Western Pacific ocean -- these islands autonomously govern over 100,000 square miles of ocean in one of the most biodiverse regions on Earth.  This is an unprecedented ocean sustainability opportunity: working together to protect oceans, people, and culture.  You can help make a difference.SpecificallyWe need funds to be able to move this project forward quickly. We want to take advantage of the momentum in the region.  Grant funds (see our supporters below) have enabled us to work on Ulithi for the past 3 years, and to establish the method and get the word out.  Now we are ready to move forward at the request of outer islanders. We plan to hold a sustainable ocean management workshop for outer islanders in the summer 2014 on Ulithi Atoll. Examples of what your donation would cover:$30 will pay for informational materials for 2 people, or will buy one ship passage for one person to the summer 2014 workshop on Ulithi Atoll.$50 will pay for food for one week for one person during the 2014 workshop.$200 will buy a digital camera for one island community so they can photograph their fish catch and send it us as data so we can inform them of fishing pressures and management success.$500 will fund one local science team from an island community to participate in training to learn how to collect data to inform themselves of management success.$1,000 will support four local high school and college students to join the project and help develop the plans, encouraging youth participation.$2,000 will send one science team member to Ulithi to meet with communities, participate in the workshop, and conduct surveys.$25,000 will fund a summer field expedition for both local and US/Israel based science teams to conduct surveys, and work with specific communities (up to 3 islands) to develop management plans.**Funds will be used where they are most needed. The more funds we raise, the more we can do and the more islands we can include.See the perks for contributing!!The ImpactThis project has already achieved unprecedented success in the region.  These outer island communities have not been involved directly in a program like this -- designed to assist them to better understand and manage their reefs.  We have been able to involve more communities, more quickly, and with concrete plans, than any other program in the region -- and it will serve as a model beyond the region.Some quotes:""We need to sacrifice and plan today to ensure a healthy food source and healthy reefs for the future.

We have been doing our best to educate people about the issue and to encourage them to go to these meetings, speak out against offshore oil, and reach out to their representatives and state governors to express their opinion. 
We have also been launching a marketing campaign in order to have a wider reach and hopefully influence more people to get involved, and to let the decision makers know how we feel.
We are specifically seeking funding for two billboards currently in the works that will be located on the two major highways leading to and from the Outer Banks, NC, I-64 going west to Raleigh and US 158 going north to Virginia.
We have enough to cover about 2 - 3 months, but this fight could last a year or two, or longer! We need your help to keep these billboards up so that the millions of people that visit the Outer Banks every week from spring to fall understand what's at stake and can help us influence the decision makers.
Any contribution is greatly appreciated!

For 25 years I operated my own contracting enterprises. My companies performed demolition and asbestos abatement on major projects in the New York/New Jersey area.</p><h3>
<strong><u>Development of the ABCOV</u></strong><strong><u>® Method of Asbestos Destruction:</u></strong>
</h3><p><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">While in the asbestos abatement industry I realized the magnitude of worldwide asbestos contamination and of the horrific, devastating terminal health consequences borne by individuals exposed to asbestos and asbestos-containing materials. Billions of tons of asbestos-containing materials have been installed throughout the 20th century in factories, power industries, homes, refineries, automobiles, airplanes, railroad cars, military ships, private ships, military bases, government buildings, commercial buildings, office buildings, and schools, making everyone susceptible to lung cancer and Mesothelioma. </span>Fact: There is no safe level of asbestos exposure, causing the permeation of asbestos contamination to become the largest environmental and health debacle facing our world today and many years in the future. <span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">Landfill space is quickly diminishing and there are more asbestos, asbestos-containing materials and asbestos-contaminated materials in the world than landfill space to store these asbestos materials. I knew something had to be done about the deadly hazards of asbestos. This motivated me to search out new methods and technologies for removing and permanently disposing of asbestos, asbestos-containing materials, </span> and<span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif;""> asbestos-contaminated materials. I initiated and underwrote research and development of the project known as the ABCOV Method of Asbestos Destruction at Battelle Memorial Laboratories in Columbus, Ohio, and Materials Science Laboratories of the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia. During the 30 years developing the non-thermal; Federal Environmental Protection Agency approved ABCOV Method of Asbestos Destruction I encountered and treated a myriad amount of asbestos, asbestos-containing materials, and asbestos-contaminated materials. I discovered that no two asbestos-containing materials are alike, i.e. the percentage and type or types of asbestos, Serpentine or Amphibole or a combination of both, </span>embedded<span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif;""> in the matrix/ binder, the inconsistency of the matrix/binder and the contamination of the asbestos-containing materials by external hazards, such as, but not limited to, heavy metals, radionuclides, and volatile organics. Gaining this knowledge fostered the creation of various chemical formulas and the development of the most robust equipment needed to efficiently and completely destroy all forms of asbestos. </span></p><h3><strong><u>IMPORTANCE of DESTROYING ASBESTOS AND YOUR CONTRIBUTION:</u></strong></h3><p>As of January 2014, <strong>55 nations</strong> have banned asbestos, with an additional <strong>16 nations</strong> placing restrictions on its use. Although all <strong>28 countries</strong> of the European Union have banned the use of asbestos, the toxic mineral remains legal in the U.S. and Canada</p><p>Even though asbestos has been restricted and banned, there are billions of tons of asbestos remaining in our built environment, including landfills built to store asbestos. (<strong>EPA: ""All Landfills Will Fail""). </strong>The asbestos in our built environment is a ticking time bomb that is ominous to our health and will remain so until it is permanently taken out of our environment.   </p><p><span style=""font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"">I have dedicated the past 30 years filing original patents, acquiring Federal Environmental Protection Agency and State approvals and refining the ABCOV® Method of Asbestos Destruction to full commercial availability. It's very important to those who suffer from lung cancer and Mesothelioma, their friends and loved ones to accomplish full implementation of the ABCOV Method of Asbestos Destruction to permanently remove asbestos from our environment to protect and prevent future generations from contracting and suffering from the fatal diseases lung cancer and Mesothelioma.  </span></p><ul></ul><h3><u><strong>What Is Mesothelioma and What Are The Symptoms?</strong></u></h3><p><strong><u>Mesothelioma:</u> A<u> </u>rare cancer of the membrane that covers the lungs and chest cavity (pleura), the membrane lining the abdominal cavity (peritoneum), or membranes surrounding other internal organs.  Signs of mesothelioma may not appear until 30 to 40 years after exposure to asbestos.</strong></p><h3><strong><u>Symptoms:</u> </strong></h3><ul>
<li><p><strong>Shortness of Breath;</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tightness in the</strong><strong> Chest;</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Constant Dry Cough;</strong></p></li>

<li>More than <span style=""font-weight: 700;"">125 million people</span> worldwide encounter asbestos in the workplace.</li>

</h3><p> </p><p><br/> </p></div>","Tony Nocito Biography:  I have spent my adult career working in the construction industry in the Greater New York area. For 25 years I operated my own contracting enterprises. My companies performed demolition and asbestos abatement on major projects in the New York/New Jersey area.
Development of the ABCOV® Method of Asbestos Destruction:
While in the asbestos abatement industry I realized the magnitude of worldwide asbestos contamination and of the horrific, devastating terminal health consequences borne by individuals exposed to asbestos and asbestos-containing materials. Billions of tons of asbestos-containing materials have been installed throughout the 20th century in factories, power industries, homes, refineries, automobiles, airplanes, railroad cars, military ships, private ships, military bases, government buildings, commercial buildings, office buildings, and schools, making everyone susceptible to lung cancer and Mesothelioma. Fact: There is no safe level of asbestos exposure, causing the permeation of asbestos contamination to become the largest environmental and health debacle facing our world today and many years in the future. Landfill space is quickly diminishing and there are more asbestos, asbestos-containing materials and asbestos-contaminated materials in the world than landfill space to store these asbestos materials. I knew something had to be done about the deadly hazards of asbestos. This motivated me to search out new methods and technologies for removing and permanently disposing of asbestos, asbestos-containing materials,  and asbestos-contaminated materials. I initiated and underwrote research and development of the project known as the ABCOV Method of Asbestos Destruction at Battelle Memorial Laboratories in Columbus, Ohio, and Materials Science Laboratories of the Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia. During the 30 years developing the non-thermal; Federal Environmental Protection Agency approved ABCOV Method of Asbestos Destruction I encountered and treated a myriad amount of asbestos, asbestos-containing materials, and asbestos-contaminated materials. I discovered that no two asbestos-containing materials are alike, i.e. the percentage and type or types of asbestos, Serpentine or Amphibole or a combination of both, embedded in the matrix/ binder, the inconsistency of the matrix/binder and the contamination of the asbestos-containing materials by external hazards, such as, but not limited to, heavy metals, radionuclides, and volatile organics. Gaining this knowledge fostered the creation of various chemical formulas and the development of the most robust equipment needed to efficiently and completely destroy all forms of asbestos. IMPORTANCE of DESTROYING ASBESTOS AND YOUR CONTRIBUTION:As of January 2014, 55 nations have banned asbestos, with an additional 16 nations placing restrictions on its use. Although all 28 countries of the European Union have banned the use of asbestos, the toxic mineral remains legal in the U.S. and CanadaEven though asbestos has been restricted and banned, there are billions of tons of asbestos remaining in our built environment, including landfills built to store asbestos. (EPA: ""All Landfills Will Fail""). The asbestos in our built environment is a ticking time bomb that is ominous to our health and will remain so until it is permanently taken out of our environment.   I have dedicated the past 30 years filing original patents, acquiring Federal Environmental Protection Agency and State approvals and refining the ABCOV® Method of Asbestos Destruction to full commercial availability. It's very important to those who suffer from lung cancer and Mesothelioma, their friends and loved ones to accomplish full implementation of the ABCOV Method of Asbestos Destruction to permanently remove asbestos from our environment to protect and prevent future generations from contracting and suffering from the fatal diseases lung cancer and Mesothelioma.  What Is Mesothelioma and What Are The Symptoms?Mesothelioma: A rare cancer of the membrane that covers the lungs and chest cavity (pleura), the membrane lining the abdominal cavity (peritoneum), or membranes surrounding other internal organs.  Signs of mesothelioma may not appear until 30 to 40 years after exposure to asbestos.Symptoms: 
Shortness of Breath;
Tightness in the Chest;
Constant Dry Cough;
Chest Pain;
Appetite Loss;
Enlarged Fingertips;
Nail Deformities.
 ASBESTOS STATISTICS: 
Your Contribution to The ABCOV® Method of Asbestos Destruction Will Help to Prevent Asbestos Exposure:
More than 3,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with Mesothelioma each year.
More than 125 million people worldwide encounter asbestos in the workplace.

Every five minutes someone in the world dies from asbestos-related illnesses, 100,000 people a year and 5 to 10 million people by 2030.

Every year there are more people killed by asbestos than in road accidents.
For the past 34 years, asbestos has been removed, although not eliminated, but simply bagged, tagged and stored in landfills.


What happens when asbestos is landfilled: bags break allowing asbestos to become airborne and migrate into the water table.

Risks and Challenges 
Every production has inherent risks and challenges, thankfully we have done this many times before and understand the risks involved and how to avoid them, and how to use challenges to our advantage when we can't bypass them. We gathered a small team of seasoned adventurers, ready to face any road blocks.
With our combined years of experience and expertise in all aspects of this production, we feel confident that we will deliver an outstanding film that will help shape water policy and management in California.

<p><span style="""">Overlook Mountain, in Woodstock New York, may well be one of the most important and sacred mountains in the Catskill region, if not arguably all the northeast United States. The mountain acts as a major gateway to Catskill Forest Preserve, half a million acres and is also the closest Catskill Mountain trailhead to the New York City metropolitan area. Overlook Mountain is also the center of Tibetan Buddhism in North America and was recognized as a sacred site by the Iroquois Confederacy at the Council at Onondaga in 1979.

<p>The Jolly Rovers are an independent organization of volunteer trail builders, from all walks of life, specializing in traditional stonework. Without the use of mortar, heavy machinery or imported materials, our volunteers transform highly damaged paths in public parklands into aesthetic works of art, using nothing but native materials found onsite and construction techniques that date back to antiquity.  <br/></p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Many paths and trails that receive heavy visitation are in need of repair work due to erosion from heavy use. The resulting erosion creates unsightly scars, negative impacts on the ecosystem and sometimes worsens to the point where safety itself becomes an issue. <br/></span></p>

Stone survives the test of time, and when constructed with care, structures built with it can be inviting and inspiring, welcoming people that might not otherwise venture into the woods. We believe this increase in accessibility directly affects the well being of a community as well as the preservation of such open space for future generations; after all, the more people that are able to identify with open space, the more they will fight to keep it.</span></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; Why</h3>
<p>To this end we seek to grow so we can expand our volunteer efforts. We've been successful in testing out this growth over the past 4 years, with volunteer service hours growing by 25% annually and membership increasing at roughly the same rate. In order to sustain this growth and expand our reach to more regions we'll need to take the next step in officially forming as a tax exempt non-profit organization. </p>
<p></p>

<p>There will be legal and accounting fees associated with the process of getting us through the strict state and federal requirements for tax exemption.  We will also need to insure the Jolly Rover organization and its members with a general liability policy for this upcoming growth year. Finally, we'll need to create outreach and promotional materials along with making numerous upgrades to our <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/support-volunteer-stoneworkers-in-public-parks/edit/jollyrovers.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>. These website upgrades and outreach materials will allow us to describe our accomplishments of the past and detail our vision for the future.</p>

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We are humbly asking the public to help support these start up expenses in this campaign, the results of which will set us up as a fully independent organization capable of sustaining itself for the long term. The total estimate of $16,015 has been reached by obtaining quotes from professionals in each field. Unfortunately, since we are not yet a tax exempt organization, taxes will have to be paid on all donations received, so a percentage has been added on to each item listed above to help cover this requirement.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Should we be fortunate enough to raise more funds than the costs outlined above, they will be put into the organization's bank account and used to help support the Rover's next goal after achieving its tax exempt status, the hiring of a full-time Executive Director. With this Director we will be able to sustain the administration and logistics of our current scope of activity while also setting us up</span> strategically to execute our Board of Directors desire to grow in the future.<br/></p>

<h3>Sustaining Ourselves Into the Future</h3>
<p>As a tax exempt non-profit organization several opportunities will open up to us that will allow us to sustain our activities well into the future. All proceeds from these sources will be used to sustain and further the mission of the Jolly Rovers into the future.</p>
<p><b>Tax Deductible Donations</b> - Through our growing network of friends and supporters, we will finally be able to accept gifts from donors in all the states we work in. </p>
<p><b>Contracts</b> - Through our years of work in the parks and forest system, we have made a name for ourselves as one of the most capable and technically advanced volunteer trail crews in the country. As a result, contracts with the United States Forest Service have been offered to us but we have been unable to pursue them due to us lacking tax exempt status with the IRS. Once obtained, we will be able to take advantage of these long term agreements which will help fund portions of our work for years to come. </p>
<p><b>Workshop Fees</b> - One of the ways we will be able to support our volunteers need for tools, equipment and gear maintenance will be to accept fees for the workshops we teach throughout the eastern United States. As our reputation increases so does the amount of workshop offers we get.</p>
<p><b>Grant Eligibility</b> -  There are several annual funding opportunities through both the state and federal government which finance trail and park rehabilitation projects. With our tax exempt status, we would be eligible to apply for these.</p>

<h3>History of the Jolly Rovers<span><br/></span>
</h3>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p>The Jolly Rovers began with a small group of ten volunteers who met on the Appalachian Trail; these ten were veterans of a unique multi-year educational program with <a href=""www.nynjtc.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">New York-New Jersey Trail Conference</a> and the Appalachian Trail Conservancy at Bear Mountain State Park, NY, where professional trail builders from all over the country trained volunteers in the craft of traditional stonework for the benefit of the legendary Appalachian Trail.  </p>
<p>In 2011, three of these ten got together over dinner to develop an idea; <i>to take the traditional stone working skills learned in one park and spread them to all parks in need, not just in New York, but all over the country. </i> When the three approached the ten with the idea, all were in. This jolly group of friends who committed themselves to rove became the Jolly Rovers. </p>

Each of these members is trained over a four day period, free of charge, and apprenticed over ten additional days before gaining full membership. Collectively, these volunteers contribute a total of 5,000 hours of skilled service annually. With our recruitment interest remaining strong for next year, we fully expect these numbers to increase. </div>

Jolly Rover gear is fun to wear. It never ceases to amaze us just how many people look twice anytime they see the skull and crossed hammers, it's a definite conversation starter. The Jolly Rover emblem is a play off of the legendary ""Jolly Roger"" flag of pirate lore. We promise all donors that the Rovers do not employ the traditional practices of piracy associated with its original symbolism. Rather, its adaptation refers to the fact that the Rovers, by nature of our specialized work, are different, tackling every project with an independent spirit and sense of adventure. </div><div>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Stickers and Patches ($10-$25) </b>- Both sport our emblem of the skull and crossed hammers. Stickers and patches are 3"" X 3"" circles with our white emblem on a black background. (Sticker is not pictured above, but is the same layout as the patch.) Donors that give $10 will get a sticker and $25 will get both a sticker and a patch.</p>
<p><b>Bandanna ($50)</b> - Made in the USA from 100% American cotton, these have become very popular with our crew to wear or keep handy in ones pack; it's comfortable and keeps the sweat out of your eyes on active days of labor or recreation. Donors that give $50 will also get one of each item listed above.</p>

<br/>
</div><div><br/></div></div>","What We Do and Why






""There is something elementally satisfying about the challenge of this work, both personally and as a group.""                                                                  -Bob Chapel - Jolly Rover Volunteer - Warwick, NY                                          


The Jolly Rovers are an independent organization of volunteer trail builders, from all walks of life, specializing in traditional stonework. Without the use of mortar, heavy machinery or imported materials, our volunteers transform highly damaged paths in public parklands into aesthetic works of art, using nothing but native materials found onsite and construction techniques that date back to antiquity.  









Our growing family of 30 volunteers contributes over 5,000 hours of skilled service  every year through building and teaching workshops in public parks and forests, with each individual volunteering an average of 150 hours annually. These volunteers employ their craft at the request of state, federal and nonprofit land managers on some of the most heavily trafficked and ecologically damaged paths in the northeastern United States.  





Many paths and trails that receive heavy visitation are in need of repair work due to erosion from heavy use. The resulting erosion creates unsightly scars, negative impacts on the ecosystem and sometimes worsens to the point where safety itself becomes an issue. 
The work we leave behind aims to inspire those that use it long after we are gone, proving that sustainability and beauty can be crafted into something of practical use for the public benefit. What we create proves that the spirit of volunteerism can still build beautiful things that will last for generations, allowing for increased access to both the experienced hiker and the novice individual, family or school group interested in enjoying a regions natural treasures.








Like similar stone structures from the ancient world that survive to this day, our work strives to continue the legacy of aesthetic and sustainable principles achieved by these early builders. Stone survives the test of time, and when constructed with care, structures built with it can be inviting and inspiring, welcoming people that might not otherwise venture into the woods. We believe this increase in accessibility directly affects the well being of a community as well as the preservation of such open space for future generations; after all, the more people that are able to identify with open space, the more they will fight to keep it.
""It’s my way of giving back to the community by improving our parks with structures that will outlive me, and doing that work with the greatest bunch of people I know.""                                                                             -Bob Ricci - Jolly Rover Volunteer - Easton, PA




What We Need & Why
To this end we seek to grow so we can expand our volunteer efforts. We've been successful in testing out this growth over the past 4 years, with volunteer service hours growing by 25% annually and membership increasing at roughly the same rate. In order to sustain this growth and expand our reach to more regions we'll need to take the next step in officially forming as a tax exempt non-profit organization. 


There will be legal and accounting fees associated with the process of getting us through the strict state and federal requirements for tax exemption.  We will also need to insure the Jolly Rover organization and its members with a general liability policy for this upcoming growth year. Finally, we'll need to create outreach and promotional materials along with making numerous upgrades to our website. These website upgrades and outreach materials will allow us to describe our accomplishments of the past and detail our vision for the future.


- Insurance - $750 - General liability policy for all members. 
- Legal Services  - $7,500 - Incorporation and tax exemption.
- Web and Outreach Development - $6,375 - Upgrades to our existing website and the creation of outreach materials.
- Accounting - $625 - General accounting fees for the upcoming year. 
- Indiegogo - $765 - Indiegogo charges a 9% fee on all funds raised if we don't reach our goal, but only 4% if we do. Please help us reach our goal. 
We are humbly asking the public to help support these start up expenses in this campaign, the results of which will set us up as a fully independent organization capable of sustaining itself for the long term. The total estimate of $16,015 has been reached by obtaining quotes from professionals in each field. Unfortunately, since we are not yet a tax exempt organization, taxes will have to be paid on all donations received, so a percentage has been added on to each item listed above to help cover this requirement.
Should we be fortunate enough to raise more funds than the costs outlined above, they will be put into the organization's bank account and used to help support the Rover's next goal after achieving its tax exempt status, the hiring of a full-time Executive Director. With this Director we will be able to sustain the administration and logistics of our current scope of activity while also setting us up strategically to execute our Board of Directors desire to grow in the future.




Sustaining Ourselves Into the Future
As a tax exempt non-profit organization several opportunities will open up to us that will allow us to sustain our activities well into the future. All proceeds from these sources will be used to sustain and further the mission of the Jolly Rovers into the future.
Tax Deductible Donations - Through our growing network of friends and supporters, we will finally be able to accept gifts from donors in all the states we work in. 
Contracts - Through our years of work in the parks and forest system, we have made a name for ourselves as one of the most capable and technically advanced volunteer trail crews in the country. As a result, contracts with the United States Forest Service have been offered to us but we have been unable to pursue them due to us lacking tax exempt status with the IRS. Once obtained, we will be able to take advantage of these long term agreements which will help fund portions of our work for years to come. 
Workshop Fees - One of the ways we will be able to support our volunteers need for tools, equipment and gear maintenance will be to accept fees for the workshops we teach throughout the eastern United States. As our reputation increases so does the amount of workshop offers we get.
Grant Eligibility -  There are several annual funding opportunities through both the state and federal government which finance trail and park rehabilitation projects. With our tax exempt status, we would be eligible to apply for these.


History of the Jolly Rovers



The Jolly Rovers began with a small group of ten volunteers who met on the Appalachian Trail; these ten were veterans of a unique multi-year educational program with New York-New Jersey Trail Conference and the Appalachian Trail Conservancy at Bear Mountain State Park, NY, where professional trail builders from all over the country trained volunteers in the craft of traditional stonework for the benefit of the legendary Appalachian Trail.  
In 2011, three of these ten got together over dinner to develop an idea; to take the traditional stone working skills learned in one park and spread them to all parks in need, not just in New York, but all over the country.  When the three approached the ten with the idea, all were in. This jolly group of friends who committed themselves to rove became the Jolly Rovers. 


""Building with stone, building friendships, both to last a lifetime and longer; building them in tough conditions only makes them stronger.""    -Alicia Mandelkow - Jolly Rover Volunteer, New York, NY        




                                                          

Now, in our fourth year of operation, we have begun to take the steps necessary to form as a fully operational nonprofit organization. A board of directors has been elected, bylaws have been written and the Rovers numbers have expanded to 30 full time crew members. Each of these members is trained over a four day period, free of charge, and apprenticed over ten additional days before gaining full membership. Collectively, these volunteers contribute a total of 5,000 hours of skilled service annually. With our recruitment interest remaining strong for next year, we fully expect these numbers to increase. 







Apart from our efforts to directly improve parklands in the northeast directly through our construction projects, another key part to our mission is to spread the knowledge to other volunteer groups across the country. We seek out organizations and government agencies in need of affordable training opportunities to enhance the skill sets of their own local volunteer communities. Our volunteer instructors currently travel from North Carolina to New Hampshire at the invitation of these host organizations and agencies, some of which include the United States Forest Service, the Appalachian Trail Conservancy, the New York-New Jersey Trail Conference, the Wilderness Society, the Monadnock Conservancy and the Vermont Youth Conservation Corp.   


""The Jolly Rovers team provided not only one of the most sought out courses during the Wilderness Skills Institute, they provided one of the most highly rated segments of training. Their energy and enthusiasm for the craft was infectious and noted by just about everyone who took the course.""                                                                                                                   -Bill Hodge - Director - Southern Appalachian Wilderness Stewards, The Wilderness Society                                                                                    

Through these workshops we aim to build a lot more than just works in stone, in every community we visit we strive to build the culture of camaraderie and volunteerism that has brought us together and keeps us coming back for more. 



     The Jolly Rovers will always be a small organization close to its roots, but through education initiatives our small organization can enhance the way volunteers do work in our public parks and forests across the country. Through our volunteer instructor program we can bring top quality instruction and inspiration to organizations and park agencies whose budgets are becoming increasingly tight every year.




What You Get!
NOTE: Indiegogo does not allow you to put a size or color down for certain perks below. If you choose a perk that does require a size or color you can email us that information at jollyrovertrailcrew@gmail.com or we will get in touch with you via email after the campaign is over.

Jolly Rover gear is fun to wear. It never ceases to amaze us just how many people look twice anytime they see the skull and crossed hammers, it's a definite conversation starter. The Jolly Rover emblem is a play off of the legendary ""Jolly Roger"" flag of pirate lore. We promise all donors that the Rovers do not employ the traditional practices of piracy associated with its original symbolism. Rather, its adaptation refers to the fact that the Rovers, by nature of our specialized work, are different, tackling every project with an independent spirit and sense of adventure. 

Stickers and Patches ($10-$25) - Both sport our emblem of the skull and crossed hammers. Stickers and patches are 3"" X 3"" circles with our white emblem on a black background. (Sticker is not pictured above, but is the same layout as the patch.) Donors that give $10 will get a sticker and $25 will get both a sticker and a patch.
Bandanna ($50) - Made in the USA from 100% American cotton, these have become very popular with our crew to wear or keep handy in ones pack; it's comfortable and keeps the sweat out of your eyes on active days of labor or recreation. Donors that give $50 will also get one of each item listed above.





Hat ($100) - The Jolly Rover baseball cap is made from 100% cotton and sports the embroidered skull and crossed hammers on the front with the ""Jolly Rovers Trail Crew"" lettering on the back. Donors that give $100 will also get one of each item listed above.



Organic T-Shirt ($200) - ""Adventurous. Rigorous. Creative. Constructive."" These words symbolize the Jolly Rovers volunteer effort and what you're supporting. A slight variation of the shirt our crew members wear in the field, these shirts are made from 100% organic cotton and carry the skull and crossed hammer emblem on the front and our Rover seal on the back. It's hard to find a more  comfortable shirt! Sizes run from small - 2X large. Donors that give $200 will also get one of each item listed above. 









Aurorae Yoga Mat Combo ($300) - Yoga is a great way to keep everything in line after a day of work or pleasure on the trail. This Aurorae Classic Yoga Mat is ultra-thick, extra-long with a focal point icon. Biodegradable and free from Phthalates, Latex & Silicone. It's one of the top selling yoga mats on Amazon.com.

Aurorae Multi Purpose Back Pack Combo ($300) - This Aurorae sport bag/multi purpose cross body sling backpack is great for yoga, hiking, biking, travel, gym, school and  the office. Donors that give $300 will also get one of each item listed above, that includes the Jolly Rover shirt, hat, bandanna, patch and sticker, a $100 value! Special thanks to our supporters at Aurorae Yoga for their support in this campaign. Donors, please state which of the above colors you want when you place your order. (Left to right) Taupe, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Red, Ebony, Grey.
""Behind the Steps"" Tour - ($1,000) The Jolly Rovers will organize and lead a day hike tour for you or a group to a Jolly Rover project of your choosing.  From the volunteers that swing the hammers and set the stones, you'll hear what goes into shaping a stone from a boulder to how it travels hundreds of feet to its final and precise destination using techniques that date back to antiquity. Donors will also receive the Jolly Rover shirt, hat, bandanna, patch and sticker along with the yoga mat and bag of their choosing!

Workshop ($3,000) - The Jolly Rovers will organize and execute a 2 day training workshop for 12 people with an organization of your choosing. The workshop course will be tailored to the needs of that organization and will teach volunteers and/or staff how to split, shape and build with stone in their given location. Courses will be organized for the 2015 calendar year. We ask that the organization chosen be one that the donor has an affiliation with so that proper introductions can be made.

<p>... to place at least 10 motion-triggered cameras deep inside Virachey National Park, Cambodia in January 2014 to <strong>proof existence of endangered species and justify limiting concessions to land already granted</strong>.

<h3>The Dilemma</h3>
<p><span>Virachey National Park is located in the extreme Northeast of Cambodia in an area also known as ""The Dragon's Tail"" of the Kingdom. At 3,325 sq. km is Cambodia's largest national park and it is bordered by protected areas in Laos to the north and Vietnam to the east -Nam Kong PPA and Chu Mom Ray, respectively. <span>According to the highlander people who live in the park's buffer zone along at the Sesan River</span><span>, tigers, elephants and possibly even rhinoceros make their homes in Virachey, however their existence is not verified and no conservation group or NGO is currently protecting them.</span></span></p>
<p>In 2008, the World Bank abandoned their conservation and ecotourism programs at Virachey. <a href=""http://cfdt52x.googlepages.com/Jupiter_SmallCCC.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">read more</a> Sections along the Vietnamese border have been sold off to rubber developers, and illegal loggers and poachers penetrate the park with exemption from punishment. Upwards of 90% of Virachey has been made available for mining exploration, however according to unofficial reports, there are simply not enough valuable mineral deposits to justify extraction by the company that holds the exploration license.</p>

<h2> </h2>
<h3>The Opportunity</h3>
<p><span>An ineffective moratorium on logging is currently in place in Virachey and elsewhere in the region, yet illegal logging and land sales continue unabated. Nevertheless it offers</span> a last hope for discovery and conservation in a place <strong>where scientific work has never been done</strong>. There are <strong>140 mammal species</strong> likely to live in the park, at least <strong>15 among them are rated endangered, critically endangered or probably exstinct</strong> according to the <a href=""http://www.iucnredlist.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species"">IUCN Red List</a>. If we<strong> </strong>can capture images of this wildlife, it will provide positive proof that the park retains biodiversity that should be preserved, and justify limiting concessions to land already granted. If the cameras can capture the image of tiger, or snap a photo of a rhino, we can change the destiny of the endangered species that may still call Virachey home.</p>
<p>Small proof excists that the biodiversity of the park is extraordinary. But this is by far not enough.</p>

<p>Virachey National Park is one of the largest protected areas in Cambodia, covering 3,325 square kilometers of tropical forests and grasslands streching east to Vietnam, north to Laos and west to Stung Treng Province. It is bordered by an equally-large wilderness to the north on the Laos side called Nam Kohng Provincial Protected Area (NKPPA), a 55,000 hectare jungle in Ratanakiri called the Vuen Sai-Siem Pang Protected Forest. To the east, it connects to Chu Mom Ray National Park in Vietnam. And Virachey is the vital link wedged in between.</p>

With your support we can truly Save the Virachey National Park in Cambodia.
Für Deutsch bitte nach unten scrollen !
The Plan
... to place at least 10 motion-triggered cameras deep inside Virachey National Park, Cambodia in January 2014 to proof existence of endangered species and justify limiting concessions to land already granted. A team of local rangers picks them up 2 months later, before the onset of the rainy season. The expedition will take around 2-3 weeks.
Have a closer look at this previous GPS recorded trek to Veal Thom grassland inside the park. We will go another 10-20 km north than what you can see on the map close the Lao border and place the cameras on the holy Haling Halang mountain.
 Small gifts for small donations ;). Look to the right    -->

The Dilemma
Virachey National Park is located in the extreme Northeast of Cambodia in an area also known as ""The Dragon's Tail"" of the Kingdom. At 3,325 sq. km is Cambodia's largest national park and it is bordered by protected areas in Laos to the north and Vietnam to the east -Nam Kong PPA and Chu Mom Ray, respectively. According to the highlander people who live in the park's buffer zone along at the Sesan River, tigers, elephants and possibly even rhinoceros make their homes in Virachey, however their existence is not verified and no conservation group or NGO is currently protecting them.
In 2008, the World Bank abandoned their conservation and ecotourism programs at Virachey. read more Sections along the Vietnamese border have been sold off to rubber developers, and illegal loggers and poachers penetrate the park with exemption from punishment. Upwards of 90% of Virachey has been made available for mining exploration, however according to unofficial reports, there are simply not enough valuable mineral deposits to justify extraction by the company that holds the exploration license.

 
The Opportunity
An ineffective moratorium on logging is currently in place in Virachey and elsewhere in the region, yet illegal logging and land sales continue unabated. Nevertheless it offers a last hope for discovery and conservation in a place where scientific work has never been done. There are 140 mammal species likely to live in the park, at least 15 among them are rated endangered, critically endangered or probably exstinct according to the IUCN Red List. If we can capture images of this wildlife, it will provide positive proof that the park retains biodiversity that should be preserved, and justify limiting concessions to land already granted. If the cameras can capture the image of tiger, or snap a photo of a rhino, we can change the destiny of the endangered species that may still call Virachey home.
Small proof excists that the biodiversity of the park is extraordinary. But this is by far not enough.

Siamese Crocodile ""critically endangered""                      
This Siamese crocodile captured near Jark Village on the O Lai Lai River in the park's buffer zone. The Siamese croc has been written off by NGOs as extinct in Virachey. This picture proves the opposite.

<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<h2><strong><span>Help save sea turtles and contribute to the conservation of marine biodiversity</span></strong></h2>
<p><strong><span> </span></strong></p>
<h2><strong>Problem</strong></h2>
<p>Sea turtles have been around for over 150 million years. Despite their terrestrial origin they evolved and became adapted to the ocean, unlike other reptiles. There are 5 species of sea turtles occurring in Portuguese waters, all listed on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species as “endangered” or “critically endangered”. The survival rate of sea turtles is decreasing, largely due to anthropogenic actions that destroy their nesting habitats, and also due to poor coastal management plans, pollution, and accidental capture by fisheries.</p>
<p>In order to avoid the extinction of these species, more research on their behavior and habitats is needed, so that we can promote their survival. Some sea turtles travel 10 thousand miles each year crossing the territorial waters of different countries. Therefore, considering these wide ranging species, biodiversity conservation must be seen as a priority that concerns us all, not just one country or region.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Who are we?</strong></h2>
<p><strong><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/57272/indiegogo-turtles/cramq.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/>CRAM-Q</strong> (Rehabilitation Center of Marine Animals of Quiaios),  is managed by SPVS (Portuguese Wildlife Society), a nonprofit Non-Governmental Organization which <strong>main objective is to boost and encourage research on Wildlife. </strong>Our mission at CRAM-Q focuses on the <strong>rescue, rehabilitation and return of marine animals back to nature</strong> (birds, mammals and reptiles) while <strong>increasing the scientific knowledge about these animals and their habitats</strong>. We are a team of technicians and researchers, rescuing animals from more than 500 km of the Portuguese coast with an average of five hundred interventions each year. Although cetaceans and seabirds are also admitted to CRAM-Q, with respect to turtles we have already rehabilitated common-turtles (<em>Caretta caretta</em>), green turtles (<em>Chelonia mydas</em>) and leatherback turtles (<em>Dermochelys coriacea</em>).</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Our objective</strong></h2>
Presently our main objective is to acquire the necessary transmitters to monitor sea turtles after their release back to the ocean. Tracking rehabilitated turtles is very important. <strong>Monitoring turtles after their release is the best way to ultimately evaluate the success of the rehabilitation process. By using post-release monitoring we are able to know where the turtle is travelling to, what type of dives are made, etc. Most importantly, it is the only way to find out what regions of the ocean (migration corridors, feeding areas, etc.) are actually important for their overall conservation</strong>. Until 2009 marine turtles were thought to have a “marginal occurrence” in Portuguese waters. Since then our research team was already able to demonstrate that sea turtles are much more frequent in our waters. In fact, in 2011 alone we collected 150 stranded turtles and 60 turtles were observed during a 4-day aerial census.At this point and because we have been struggling financially, we cannot meet the budget needed to purchase the necessary sea turtle transmitters. Presently, all available funding supports operational costs only, such as medication and food, specific analysis and veterinary care, staff salaries, maintenance of facilities (water, electricity, repairs), fuel for animal rescuing and releases.</div>
<div>
<strong>The rehabilitation process of each sea turtle is often very long, expensive, involving many people. Without transmitters, not only do we lose the real outcome of the turtle rehabilitation process</strong> (did the turtle survive or not after release?), <strong>we also lose extremely valuable information on their needs and threats across the ocean</strong>. <strong>These devices are vital to the continued study of these animals, largely contributing to the conservation of sea turtle species</strong>.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<h2>Placing transmitters</h2>
<div>The attachment process is also harmless to the sea turtle.</div>

</div></div>","Summary
Help save sea turtles and contribute to the conservation of marine biodiversity
 
Problem
Sea turtles have been around for over 150 million years. Despite their terrestrial origin they evolved and became adapted to the ocean, unlike other reptiles. There are 5 species of sea turtles occurring in Portuguese waters, all listed on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species as “endangered” or “critically endangered”. The survival rate of sea turtles is decreasing, largely due to anthropogenic actions that destroy their nesting habitats, and also due to poor coastal management plans, pollution, and accidental capture by fisheries.
In order to avoid the extinction of these species, more research on their behavior and habitats is needed, so that we can promote their survival. Some sea turtles travel 10 thousand miles each year crossing the territorial waters of different countries. Therefore, considering these wide ranging species, biodiversity conservation must be seen as a priority that concerns us all, not just one country or region.
 
Who are we?
CRAM-Q (Rehabilitation Center of Marine Animals of Quiaios),  is managed by SPVS (Portuguese Wildlife Society), a nonprofit Non-Governmental Organization which main objective is to boost and encourage research on Wildlife. Our mission at CRAM-Q focuses on the rescue, rehabilitation and return of marine animals back to nature (birds, mammals and reptiles) while increasing the scientific knowledge about these animals and their habitats. We are a team of technicians and researchers, rescuing animals from more than 500 km of the Portuguese coast with an average of five hundred interventions each year. Although cetaceans and seabirds are also admitted to CRAM-Q, with respect to turtles we have already rehabilitated common-turtles (Caretta caretta), green turtles (Chelonia mydas) and leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea).
 
Our objective
Presently our main objective is to acquire the necessary transmitters to monitor sea turtles after their release back to the ocean. Tracking rehabilitated turtles is very important. Monitoring turtles after their release is the best way to ultimately evaluate the success of the rehabilitation process. By using post-release monitoring we are able to know where the turtle is travelling to, what type of dives are made, etc. Most importantly, it is the only way to find out what regions of the ocean (migration corridors, feeding areas, etc.) are actually important for their overall conservation. Until 2009 marine turtles were thought to have a “marginal occurrence” in Portuguese waters. Since then our research team was already able to demonstrate that sea turtles are much more frequent in our waters. In fact, in 2011 alone we collected 150 stranded turtles and 60 turtles were observed during a 4-day aerial census.At this point and because we have been struggling financially, we cannot meet the budget needed to purchase the necessary sea turtle transmitters. Presently, all available funding supports operational costs only, such as medication and food, specific analysis and veterinary care, staff salaries, maintenance of facilities (water, electricity, repairs), fuel for animal rescuing and releases.

The rehabilitation process of each sea turtle is often very long, expensive, involving many people. Without transmitters, not only do we lose the real outcome of the turtle rehabilitation process (did the turtle survive or not after release?), we also lose extremely valuable information on their needs and threats across the ocean. These devices are vital to the continued study of these animals, largely contributing to the conservation of sea turtle species.
 
 
Placing transmitters
The attachment process is also harmless to the sea turtle.

<p>   The main goal of the campaign “<strong><em>A documentary for Mayflower”</em></strong> is to create a documentary film about the Mayflower Bocawina National Park in Belize. <br/><br/>    My name is Duarte Dellarole and I’m currently taking a degree in <strong>Ecotourism (BSc.)</strong> at Escola Superior Agrária de Coimbra (Coimbra, Portugal). As part of my <strong>curricular Internship</strong> I’ve proposed to make a documentary film about the Mayflower Bocawina National Park in Belize, where I will be staying for 3 months.</p>
<p>This Internship will be made with the support of both the <strong>Mama Noots Eco Resort</strong> (located inside the Park) and the <strong>Friends of Mayflower Bocawina </strong>NGO and community based organization that co-manages the Park.</p>
<p>    Filming nature has always been one of my passions and this will be a great opportunity to dedicate this passion to a more serious project.    </p>
<p>    In addition to the documentary I’ve also proposed to make a<a href=""http://mayflowerbocawina.tk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong> free website for the Park</strong></a> since they are a low-budget organization.</p>

<p>Here is the short story of Wounded Nature’s organization and its purpose:<br/>As a result of 5 years of economic depression, funding for waterway and beach clean-<br/>ups has been either drastically cut or totally eliminated in the federal, state, and local<br/>budgets. As a result, the only beaches being cleaned are the main public areas where<br/>voters have easy access. These beaches happen to be areas that wildlife avoids because<br/>of the number of humans occupying this area. The areas that wildlife has migrated to,<br/>used for breeding and raising their young, failed to be acknowledged by the government.<br/>This results in an accumulation of trash that wildlife eats, becomes entangled in, and is an aesthetic eyesore to what should be a pristine and natural area.</p>
<p>The campaign is very important to me, because I grew up with the simple, yet<br/>unfortunately common mentality that we can always be dependent upon our oceans for<br/>water and food supply. However, as I continue to learn more about our marine life,<br/>I have quickly learned how easily we could lose those seemingly endless resources.<br/>If we can find the right ways in which to preserve the environment through simple<br/>recycling methods and alert others of their environmental impact, we could really make a difference.</p>
<p>With the help of contributions, our organization will form a photographic journal<br/>of litter and trash wash-up on beaches in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North<br/>Carolina. This type of journal would enable others to see what is affecting our marinelife and would inspire many to change their routines to lend a hand in the restoration process, instead of continuing to pollute it.  This grant will be used to scout beaches prior to beaches being scheduled for clean up.  The money will be used to cover equipment, travel, survey, and marketing costs.</p>
<p>In order to produce such a journal, we will<br/>need $15,000. To get people excited and motivated to help our environment,<br/>items like this journal need to be constructed or people will always lack understanding<br/>of the harm they impose on our marine life. If we do not reach this goal, we will use our funds to cover as much of this area as the raised funding will allow.</p>
<p>We will be launching five 50-55ft Victory Vessels each with a primary sponsor.<br/>Currently we have a sponsor for one of the boats and are seeking other sponsors for the<br/>remaining four.

<h3>About the cookbook</h3>
<p>The Disco Soup cookbook is an activist tool dedicated to global eaters who want to be actively part of the fight against climate change and food waste.  </p>
<p>Through insights on the worldwide food waste situation, about 100 recipes by activists of World Disco Soup Day and inspiring stories of special products, farmers and fishermen, the reader is invited to rediscover the value of food, its cultural heritage. Food is not a commodity and it cannot be wasted.</p>
<h3>What is World Disco Soup Day? </h3>
<p>On World Disco Soup Day, organizers, attendees, and chefs will collect, chop, and cook leftover food or any food that would otherwise go to waste, such as ‘ugly’ fruits and vegetables (the products which do not conform to commercial aesthetic standards). During the preparations, and for a long while after, music will be pumping and everyone will be dancing! It is a fun, gastronomic and musical event that brings together young people, students, children, seniors, cooks, and all the supporters of this battle against food waste. It is also a transformation tool that brings together diverse knowledge for education and awareness.</p>
<h3>Why this book?</h3>
<p>This book is an ode to the worldwide gastronomic heritage, in particular to those traditional recipes which use the leftovers of the previous meal and transform it into something delicious. To be able to gather these recipes, most of the volunteers reached out to their grandparents and to elderly people in their communities, whose generation didn’t conceive waste and in particular food waste. </p>
<p>We have thought of this book as an inspirational tool to reduce food waste and fight climate change in a simple and fun way, while gathering the inputs of a global community of change makers. </p>
<h3>Your contribution</h3>
<p>With your help, we will bundle the amazing recipes we have received from our network into a book, supplemented with illustrations, interviews and essays. You will be able to pre-order your Disco Soup cookbook copy. Straight after World Disco Soup Day 2021, we will send you your hard copy of the book. </p>
<h3>Who made the book?</h3>
<p>This book is made in cooperation with the Slow Food Youth Network, the World Disco Soup Day Task Force and a great number of volunteers from the past editions of World Disco Soup Day. After last year's World Disco Soup Day, we gathered food rescuing recipes from all over the world, which we now brought together in this book!</p>

</div><b>My Story</b><br/>Hello, my name is Ronny Steen, and I am an animal behaviorist conducting environmental research at a Norwegian University. I specialize in video monitoring to study animal behavior, meaning I use digital cameras to remotely monitor wildlife. I am currently working with a Greek marine research institute called <a href=""http://archipelago.gr/en/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Archipelagos</a> to observe the Eleonora’s falcons (<i>Falco eleonorae</i>), a beautiful falcon whose nesting habitat is in danger. <br/><br/>Outside the breeding season, they live in Madagascar, although in the summer they travel to breed in the Mediterranean. About 80% of the world’s population of Eleonora’s falcons are located in Greece, they breed in colonies in Islets and coastal cliffs. <br/><br/>My research team and I travel to these cliffs to place special motion-activated cameras at their nests. Our job is to record the daily activity of the Eleonora’s falcons to determine their parenting habits and diet, which in turn can help us predict the migratory patterns of other birds, and even charter environmental climate changes. <br/><br/>One of the biggest treats is invasive rats staying at the Islets, they aggressively devour the falcon eggs before they could hatch. Further, their breeding grounds being threatened by modern expansion.

<h2>Lear More About ""Estamos Aqui""<br/>
</h2>
<h3></h3>
<p><i>Estamos Aqui! We are here! The Latino population is the fastest growing American demographic. They are also among the most under-represented groups in conservation, outdoor recreation, and environmental education organizations. What are the causes and consequences of this divide? What are the challenges and opportunities? In this feature-length documentary film we will uncover and celebrate the little-known but beautiful and vibrant Latino heritage for conservation and outdoor recreation. Latino families and individuals from all over the United States are already connecting with their history, their culture, their communities and the planet through powerful, meaningful and culturally relevant interactions with nature. In Estamos Aqui we will meet these inspiring people, hear their stories and discover how our connection to nature simultaneously makes us unique and brings us together.</i></p>
<p><i>Estamos Aqui is co-directed and co-produced by Kenny Ballentine and Jose Gonzalez. Ballentine is the director of the award-winning documentary film, “Nature Kids” and is the founder of The Nature Kids Institute. Gonzalez is the founder of Latino Outdoors and is a member of the Latino Conservation Alliance. </i></p>
<p><i>Filming has taken place all over America, including a kayak trip down the LA River, a family hike in Central Park in New York City, lobbying Congress in Washington DC, and a rare “”day at the park” for families from California's’ agricultural Central Valley.

Meet The Authors
 Kenny Ballentine


Kenny
  Ballentine is a family-man, award winning filmmaker, author, public  
speaker and nature guide. He is the creator of the feature-length 
documentary film ""Nature Kids"", the author of ""The Nature Connection 
Pyramid"" and the founder of The  Nature Kids Institute.  Kenny’s mission
 in life is to bring the wonders  of the natural world into the lives of
 children everywhere.  He  envisions a future where our everyday lives 
will be as immersed in  nature as they are in technology and where 
children are outside,  healthy, and deeply connected to the planet they 
will inherit.  The  primary focus of Kenny’s films, workshops, speeches 
and outings is to  turn that vision into a reality. Kenny currently 
lives in beautiful  Northern California with his wife and three 
children.

Tania Moloney

Tania is passionate  about helping families connect with nature and with each other. Her
  childhood was filled with opportunities for outdoor adventures and she
  made (and ate) LOTS of mud pies. She has a head and heart full of  
cherished childhood memories of family camping trips, building 
""cubbies"",  sleeping under the stars and playing with sticks.
 Now  with her own young family, Tania desperately wants those memories 
and  experiences for her children too. As a result she has happily 
embraced  that her kids will have perpetually dirty feet and her  
pockets/car/washing machine/handbag will be permanently filled with  
nature’s treasures. Tania  
will share with you how she and her family make the choice for nature  
(more often than not anyway) despite their busy life, and you’ll take  
away lots of ideas, practical tools and resources to help you and the  
families you support choose nature more often too.

Lear More About ""Estamos Aqui""


Estamos Aqui! We are here! The Latino population is the fastest growing American demographic. They are also among the most under-represented groups in conservation, outdoor recreation, and environmental education organizations. What are the causes and consequences of this divide? What are the challenges and opportunities? In this feature-length documentary film we will uncover and celebrate the little-known but beautiful and vibrant Latino heritage for conservation and outdoor recreation. Latino families and individuals from all over the United States are already connecting with their history, their culture, their communities and the planet through powerful, meaningful and culturally relevant interactions with nature. In Estamos Aqui we will meet these inspiring people, hear their stories and discover how our connection to nature simultaneously makes us unique and brings us together.
Estamos Aqui is co-directed and co-produced by Kenny Ballentine and Jose Gonzalez. Ballentine is the director of the award-winning documentary film, “Nature Kids” and is the founder of The Nature Kids Institute. Gonzalez is the founder of Latino Outdoors and is a member of the Latino Conservation Alliance. 
Filming has taken place all over America, including a kayak trip down the LA River, a family hike in Central Park in New York City, lobbying Congress in Washington DC, and a rare “”day at the park” for families from California's’ agricultural Central Valley. In September 2015 the film will have wrapped production and will be moving into post production.  The first screening of the work in progress will be shown at the Americas Latino Eco Festival in Denver Colorado this October. It is anticipated that Estamos Aqui will begin public exhibitions in the Spring of 2016.

<h1><b>The Inspiration</b></h1>
<blockquote><i>It woke us up, that

<p>The first Earth Day in 1970 brought attention to the

1990, environmental groups and progressive companies launched initiatives to
support the “green economy.” But since then, environmental causes have moved to

<p>Now, as we approach Earth Day 2020, we have the opportunity
and the momentum to put the planet back on the front page. <b>To do that, we need to start using Earth Day, a woefully underused

<h1><b>How EdayX Works in Connection

<p>The 2020 Earth Day Global Event is a huge opportunity for

event, the Super Bowl of events for 2020, and will put a spotlight on the green
economy and recent environmental innovations.</p>
<p>EdayX will help maximize public participation in the green
movement, leading up to 2020 Earth Day. Each year, EdayX will exponentially
build momentum and interest up to the worldwide event, and then beyond.</p><p><br/></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>IWP started as a twinkle in Kelly and Ricardo's eyes. During our
Environmental Planning graduate program we focused on developing holistic water
management strategies that balance human and ecological need and support
thriving communities. Around the world, rapid urbanization, industrialization,
and the<span> development
of environmentally sensitive areas like floodplains and
stream and river corridors, are damaging the worlds watersheds. Traditional
water management</span><span> strategies are costly to maintain and
destroy numerous ecosystem services provided by a naturally functioning
watershed. These strategies often disproportionately
 impact disadvantaged </span><span>communities, particularly in the developing world,
whose needs for safe drinking water, adequate sanitation,
protection from natural disasters, and access to quality </span><span>open
space are not being met. However, new holistic approaches, things like rain
gardens, floodplain parks, and wetland water treatment facilities,that are often
simple and comparatively inexpensive to implement and maintain, are being
utilized more and more, mostly in North America and Europe. </span></p>

</div><p>Since the success of Ricardo's work
in Quito, IWP has helped four more environmental professionals, called IWP
Fellows, to work on watershed plans and designs in three different communities
in Ecuador and Cuba. In addition to providing our our Fellowswith small stipends for travel to their project sites, IWP helps them
to navigate the often confusing and intimidating process of working
in another country. We also build relationships with local organizations working on watershed issues who are open to these
new technologies but who may not have the resources
or expertise to pursue them on their own. We then connect them
 with interested Fellows and leverage our experiences  to
help the Fellow successfully work with communities to find solutions tailored
to their needs. IWP has helped to facilitate the following projects:</p>
<ul>
<li>A watershed assessment to identify  impacts on
     water quality and provide recommendations on landuse practices around a new airport for protecting and restoring the local streams in a poor
     community on the outskirts of Quito, Ecuador.</li>
<li>A wetland water treatment facility design for treating
     sewage in a impoverished community in Cuba.</li>
<li>Training city workers in holistic management of
     the urban forest in Cuenca, Ecuador.</li>
</ul>
<p>We've recently been invited to
collaborate on two more projects in Ecuador, and so we're now looking to OUR community for support in sending two more IWP Fellows to work.</p>
<h2><b>What We Need </b></h2><p><span>The funding you will help us raise
for this campaign will allow us to accomplish three major goals:

</span></p><ol>
<li><span>Send 2 new IWP Fellows to work on important projects in
     Ecuador ($2500).</span></li>
<li>Hire a web designer to revamp our website so we can
     reach more young professionals looking for real world experience and reach
     more disadvantaged communities looking for environmental planning expertise
     ($1650).</li>
<li>Pay our 501(c)3 Tax Exemption application fee ($850).</li>
</ol>
<p>All funding raised from
this campaign will be paid to our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Walls.
 Once we have received Tax exempt status IWP will be able to
open a bank account of our very own and all donations will from then on will be
tax exempt. We appreciate your support through this transition.</p>
<h2><b>Your
Impact</b></h2>
<p>By donating to our campaign you will
help fund students to travel to remote places and gain experience working with
real people. From personal experience, we know what kind of impact this can have in making one a better, more compassionate environmental
professional. You will also be helping disadvantaged communities find
affordable solutions to complex water related problems such as floods and
landslides, lack of potable water, poor sanitation, pollution, lack of habitat
for culturally important species, and lack of open space.</p>
<p>Concretely, in the short term, your
help will send 2 IWP Fellows down to Ecuador to work with our partner, Dr.
Blanca Ríos Touma of the Center for Biodiversity and Climate Change Research
of Universidad Tecnológica Indoamérica, on the following exciting
projects:</p>
<p>1) An analysis of land use impacts
on Andean tropical stream ecology and biodiversity</p>
<p>&amp;</p>
<p>2) An analysis of how
bioaccumulation of petroleum pollutants in fish pose a risk to the local Amazon
communities who depend on these freshwater resources for food.</p>
<p>$2500 of our target will be spent on
flights, lodging and any equipment the Fellows
will need to assist Dr. Touma in her research.</p>
<p>In the long term, we'd like to grow
our capacity to find new projects and continue building our relationship with
the communities we've already helped. To help us do this, we'd like to develop a more robust and eye-catching IWP
website that will enable us to:</p>
<ul>
<li>better connect with communities and young professionals
     looking for the kinds of opportunities we're offering,</li>
<li>better communicate our Fellows' successes,</li>
<li>provide a place for others to learn from our projects
     and experiences implementing and developing holistic watershed
     technologies in new and diverse places, and</li>
<li>create a space for a community of compassionate and
     experienced professionals just starting out in their careers.</li>
</ul>
<p>$1650 of our target will go to
hiring a web designer to help us develop our webpage to meet our vision.</p>
<p>So far, with the support of local
organizations on the ground at our project sites in Ecuador and
Cuba, we've been able to accomplish so much solely on grit, ""off the
grid"" (without tax exempt non-profit status).  We've learned a ton
and have been proud of our accomplishments, but we'd like to be able to do
more! We have a long term plan to fund our work which includes donations as
well as taking advantage of the numerous grants offered by
philanthropic organizations that support missions like ours. To do accomplish
this we need to get legit with Uncle Sam, so in 2015 we will finally be filing
for 501(c)3 Tax Exempt Status for Public Non-Profit Organizations. This status
will provide us with the following benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Income we earn is exempt from federal income tax</li>
<li>Donations are tax deductible for donors</li>
<li>Qualification to receive private and public grants</li>
<li>Lower postage rates on corporate mailings</li>
<li>Reduced rates for radio and public service
     announcements in the local media</li>
<li>Credibility in the nonprofit community</li>
</ul>
<p>The fee to apply for 501(c)3 Tax
Exempt Status is $850.</p>
<h2><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges</b></h2>
<p>Our experiences have given us unique
insights into the challenges and obstacles we face. For instance, it will be
important to find and enlist Fellows who have the language skills in addition
to the appropriate technical skills to  effectively help the communities
they will be working for and to communicate their findings. Additionally, in
order to meet the needs of the communities we work in, we will need to build
trust within these communities. To be persuasive in advocating for our
Fellows recommendations, we also need to be able to navigate their local
bureaucracies.  To meet these challenges we have brought together a world
class Advisory Board and have sought out organizations and professionals based
in the communities where we work. </p>
<h2><b>Other
Ways You Can Help</b></h2>
<p>Some people just can't contribute,
but that doesn't mean they can't help. Spread the word! Ask folks to make
some noise about our campaign and the great work we're doing. And don't forget
to use the Indiegogo share tools!</p>
<p>That's all there is to it. </p>

IWP started as a twinkle in Kelly and Ricardo's eyes. During our
Environmental Planning graduate program we focused on developing holistic water
management strategies that balance human and ecological need and support
thriving communities. Around the world, rapid urbanization, industrialization,
and the development
of environmentally sensitive areas like floodplains and
stream and river corridors, are damaging the worlds watersheds. Traditional
water management strategies are costly to maintain and
destroy numerous ecosystem services provided by a naturally functioning
watershed. These strategies often disproportionately
 impact disadvantaged communities, particularly in the developing world,
whose needs for safe drinking water, adequate sanitation,
protection from natural disasters, and access to quality open
space are not being met. However, new holistic approaches, things like rain
gardens, floodplain parks, and wetland water treatment facilities,that are often
simple and comparatively inexpensive to implement and maintain, are being
utilized more and more, mostly in North America and Europe. 




We wanted
to champion these types of low impact, affordable solutions in
disadvantaged communities in other parts of the world. We saw
an opportunity to use our time in school to look for ways local
communities in Latin America could utilize them and tailor them to
address the environmental problems they face.


It wasn't
as easy as we thought. We found it difficult to make connections with local
groups that could champion our ideas and the bureaucratic and logistical roadblocks seemed insurmountable.
Fortunately, our fearless leader, Ricardo da Cruz
e Sousa, persevered. He connected with a water district managing a creek in a poor neighborhood on the
edge of the city of Quito who liked his ideas and offered to work with him
on a demonstration project. The success of the project gained media attention from the local news, triggering
a city ordinance to protect and restore all the creeks in the metropolitan
area. 

Excited with this result, we founded International Watershed
Partners (or IWP) to work to pave the way for other young professionals to
utilize their burgeoning expertise on real world projects. We saw the
opportunity for other students to have a similar impact while gaining
experiences that will help them be better, more compassionate environmental
planners and designers.

<h2>Heal the Earth</h2>
<h3>Microbes are the key</h3>
<p>Naturally occuring microbes in soil produce organic acids including humic and fulvic acid. Fulvic acid cleans chemicals from the soil and makes nutrients water soluable so plants can absorb them. Fulvic acid is nature's clean up and plant feeding mechanism. It increases natural sugar levels in plants which feed microbes at the root level. Those microbes in turn increase root mass, break down nutrients in the soil and feed nutrients back to the plant. That synergistic process worked well until we overwhelmed our soil with chemicals, including synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and fungicides. Now the health of our soil has become critical.</p>
<h3>Nature has the answer</h3>
<p>Four years ago, while testing different sources of compost for a municipal landfill mitigation project, we discovered a specific compost which tested very high in organic acids. A small group of trusted friends collaberated on finding an extraction method. We discovered a process to extract fulvic acid and over 70 micro nutrients in a liquid without using any chemicals. The patent on this method is pending.</p>
<h3>Does it really work?</h3>
<p>We have tested the liquid, Fulvic Buffet and Fulvic Bloom, for three years and have proven that it does in fact improve the environment for microbes, and it helps feed plants nutrients critical to good plant health. When applied to plants our product can increase sugars in as little as thirty minutes, measured by refractometer.</p>
<p>We won third place in the Invented in Utah competition in 2010 for the extraction method we developed. We also won the 2012 Best of State for Business Innovation in Utah award.</p>
<p><img alt=""Grass Test"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/51453149/grass.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Why is it important?</h3>
<p>Healthy soil supports high levels of microbes so it cleans itself and grows healthy plants which produce fruits and vegetables that taste better and have a much longer shelf life. Sixty years ago it was common for people to store garden produce in a root celler all winter and into the next summer. Now if produce is not sold in a couple of weeks from the time it is removed from cold storage it is ""outdated"" and must be put in a landfill. The short shelf life of fruits and vegetables is a symptom of low nutrient value.</p>
<h3>Reduces need for synthetic fertilizers</h3>
<p>Microbes break down mineral nutrients, and fulvic acid feeds those nutrients into the roots of plants. High levels of microbes and fulvic acid allow plants to more easily uptake all nutrients, even synthetic fertilizers, so less fertilizer needs to be applied. Applying less fertilizer saves the environment by reducing nitrate and phosphate leaching into our water and air.</p>
<h3>Reduces need for pesticides and fungicides</h3>
<p>Healthy plants and soil tend to repel insects and disease so fewer pesticides and fungicides are needed to maintain yields. Abundant beneficial microbes also crowd out pests and fungi so they can't access roots.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img alt=""Pine Test"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://dl.dropbox.com/u/51453149/pinev.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Saves water</h3>
<p>Adding Fulvic Bloom to plants results in greater root mass and higher microbe counts in the soil. This means plants utilize water better, and the soil retains water longer, which reduces drought stress on plants.</p>
<h3>Higher yields</h3>
<p>Healthy soils and healthy plants lead to higher yields. Farmers from Georgia to Wisconsin who have added our product to their fertilizer programs have achieved five new state records for corn production in just the past  two years. Fulvic Bloom improves germination and gives young tender plants a jumpstart.</p>

<h3>Help us heal the earth</h3>
<p>We have proven the product and now we need capital to expand to give more people access to our product. Market testing our liquid fulvic in Home and Garden Shows indicates consumers are looking for a natural product which will reduce or eliminate the need for chemicals which may harm animals and children.

<p>Water scarcity is one of the biggest issues facing our society today - did you know that 1 in 8 people in the world don't have access to safe drinking water? This number will only increase over time. Despite this and other shocking statistics, most people remain woefully uneducated about the impending global water crisis - our goal is to change that.</p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://static.squarespace.com/static/50a2f224e4b02ef0e0dbd295/t/50b92a75e4b05b20d2d9c111/1354312311344/cam001.jpg?format=1000w"" src="""" style=""""/> </p>
<p>We want to create a mobilized water filtration system that serves as a functioning laboratory and educational outreach center. We're teaming up with University of Florida at Gainesville students who are currently in the process of designing an innovative and sustainable water filtration system. We design the mobile platform - they engineer the scientific components.<strong> Our plan is to raise enough money to purchase a box truck that we can then renovate and turn in to a mobile, interactive education center about water scarcity, water security and water conservation. </strong></p>
<h3><strong>What We Need </strong></h3>
<p>To do this we need your help - <strong>we need about</strong> <strong>$11,500</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>$4,500 for the purchase of a used, but adequate box truck with a little over 100,000 miles</li>
<li>$3,000 for parts and materials to retrofit the truck</li>

Water scarcity is one of the biggest issues facing our society today - did you know that 1 in 8 people in the world don't have access to safe drinking water? This number will only increase over time. Despite this and other shocking statistics, most people remain woefully uneducated about the impending global water crisis - our goal is to change that.
 
We want to create a mobilized water filtration system that serves as a functioning laboratory and educational outreach center. We're teaming up with University of Florida at Gainesville students who are currently in the process of designing an innovative and sustainable water filtration system. We design the mobile platform - they engineer the scientific components. Our plan is to raise enough money to purchase a box truck that we can then renovate and turn in to a mobile, interactive education center about water scarcity, water security and water conservation. 
What We Need 
To do this we need your help - we need about $11,500.

$4,500 for the purchase of a used, but adequate box truck with a little over 100,000 miles
$3,000 for parts and materials to retrofit the truck
$2,500 for the vehicle wrap and decal to brand the truck
$1,500 for printing costs to develop our first print run of handouts and fliers

EVERYBODY</b></p>
<p>When Jeff Wallin,
founder of The Biochar Company, became a father, his perspective entirely
shifted. He found himself wondering what life would look like for his children
after a few decades of the climate crisis.</p>
<p>As any good
entrepreneur would do, Jeff found a solution he believed could help shape a
better future: biochar—a tool that simultaneously helps heal the soil and
atmosphere, while growing better plants.</p>
<p>Today, Jeff’s
company--The Biochar Company-- is one of 11 finalists in Sir Richard Branson’s
$25 million Virgin Earth Challenge and is launching a new soil-building
system that unlocks the power of biochar to help gardeners create soil rich in
carbon-based organic matter that can capture and contain vital nutrients,
bacteria, and other microorganisms critical to plant life, and our own! </p>
<p><b><i>Why biochar?</i></b></p>
<p>Biochar was first
used by Amazon natives to transform thin, low-nutrient soil, into productive
fields for crops and grazing. Over eons, these people perfected an ecologically
sound system for converting organic material, such as wood and plant waste,
into a carbon-rich, powerful soil amendment that captures carbon in the soil
and puts it to work growing plants instead of releasing it into the
atmosphere. </p>
<p>The
reason the people behind The Biochar Companyget up in the morning is to
create products that enable you to grow life from soil better than ever before,
while at the same time, being part of the solution for a better future. Each
time someone buys one cubic yard of biochar, they are eliminating the same
amount of carbon emissions from 3.4 cars on the road. The Biochar Company
believes that a connection with the soil is important—without it, life does not
exist. Biochar helps protect our soil, food, and atmosphere – critical elements
of environmental awareness  and our existence! </p>
<p><b><i>Soil Reef and the
Virgin Earth Challenge</i></b></p>
<p>Biochar’s ability
to sequester carbon is why The Biochar Company was named a finalist in the
Virgin Earth Challenge, established by Virgin Chairman Sir Richard Branson to
incent and reward sustainable and scale-able solutions to remove greenhouse
gases from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The contest is
ongoing with only 11 companies still in the running. This campaign is one more
step in proving the commercial viability of biochar as a carbon sequestration
technology that benefits the consumer and the planet, while hopefully moving
Soil Reef closer to winning the $25 million prize. </p>
<p><b><i>How you can help</i></b></p>
<p>The thought of
combating climate change can be overwhelming. It’s easy to feel like there
isn’t much we can do on an individual level. But, using biochar <b><i>is </i></b>something you <b><i>can</i></b> do to make a long-term difference by
removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>This
campaign aims to raise a minimum of $30,000 dollars to develop and market the Soil Reef
Biochar System, an all-natural, organic biochar soil-building system that
creates dark and rich productive soil for the backyard gardener. Anyone who
contributes $100 will receive the three-part Soil Reef Biochar System
conveniently delivered to their doorstep. Those supporters who contribute $150
will also buy an Estufa Finca stove for a less-fortunate family in the
Dominican Republic. The stove, created by local craftspeople, prepares food,
discharging substantially less carbon and particulates into the air compared to
an open fire, using less wood, while creating biochar as an end product. </p>

S.A.F.E. Earth is a first of its kind, website based and fully social media linked program designed to support the growth of a global grass roots sustainability movement.  The online portal will put all of the necessary tools to save Mother Earth right at your fingertips. 
The
S.A.F.E. Earth Team will roll out the comprehensive sustainability support
program featuring an on-line Sustainability Resource Center.   It will
offer a wide range of affordable green tech support apps, introductory guides
to sustainable action, on-line webinars, subscription-based support services,
and much more.  All tools and resources will be offered in the 2 major global Climate Zones: 1) Cold / Temperate, and 2) Tropical.  Further, most apps will uniquely address issues that are particular to urban & rural settings.
S.A.F.E Earth will also be home to the  “1-1” Action Program, a 3-Step program designed to guide
small groupings of individuals, families, and organizations - working together
- toward successful pursuit of sustainable action.  
S.A.F.E. Earth On-line Resource Center 
""Get-It-Right-The-First-Time” © Tech Support Apps

These colorful, user-friendly guide apps will provide an overview of the essential “do's
and don’ts” of sustainable green technology application, as well as step-by-step tutorials addressing proper project
planning, start-up, operations, maintenance, monitoring, and ""finished product"" harvesting –
all designed to help all users avoid the most commonly made mistakes by those
pursuing sustainable actions. The first in the multiple series of Apps include in the first phase: Solar Electric-PV, Organic Composting, Rainwater Harvesting, Waste water Re-use, Energy Efficiency Upgrade, and Renewable Energy Technology Selection.
  








The Sustainability Master Framework App
The Sustainability Master Framework app introduces the user to truly sustainable actions by presenting model reference projects and encouraging the user to explore the integrated nature of the five (5) main “green” technology areas.


The “1-1” Action Program:  Small Groups -- Together -- Making Global Sustainability Progress 
The Program steps include:
Step 1: Get Inspired … Get Started!  Watch the Intro Video & Get Ready to Start,
Step 2: Get Organized … Get Going! Complete a Sustainable Action Plan and implement the plan;
Step 3:  Share Your Results.  Get Connected!  Complete a simple results survey; link on-line w/ other ""1-1"" Program participants in your area ... & around the world!
The SAFE Earth Website will also be the home of the “1-1” Action Program, a 3-Step program designed  to guide small groupings of individuals, families, and organizations - working together - toward successful pursuit of sustainable action.  We at SAFE Earth expect the ""multiplier effect"" resulting from these small group actions pursued locally, regionally, and, ultimately, globally, will help turn short term mobilizations - such as the recent global network of Climate Control mass marches - into long-term action toward achieving global sustainability.

The S.A.F.E. EARTH rallying cry is “One-One,
Bring the Balance, Save Mother Earth!”, borrowing from the name of the
traditional mutual aid program of St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands: “One-One

This includes the preliminary design of support apps and a website framework.  The app and website design work enabled us to complete a realistic budget for final development, beta testing and release.  

We estimate the final cost of app and website production alone to be approximately $282,000 or 72% of the total  $395,000 required. The remaining costs include  operations and legal services.  The pie chart illustrates where the funds will go to open and launch S.A.F.E. Earth portal, apps and service program.
PERKS: Power of One and Legacy

The Impact
 
Together  —  We Can Meet Our Biggest Global Challenge Yet…But Right Now We Need Your Help!
Sustainability: More than a Theory — A Movement!
No longer just a theoretical concept, sustainability -- The Balancing of “3-Ps” : People / Planet /  Productivity , or in business terms, “The Triple Bottom Line”, is now the cause and potential global movement that can finally bring together the global environmental/“climate action”, the equity-“99%”, and the poverty alleviation movements -- all towards creating a future that enjoys a balanced global climate AND socially balanced and healthy global communities.  

Tracking and Celebrating Our Progress!

""Its easy to be discouraged by today's dire predictions of worsening climate and economic challenge around the world -- but not if you are taking stock of progress right in your own backyard!""    Onaje Jackson, S.A.F.E. Earth founder
What is our “1-1” Team’s carbon footprint and  social benefit index today — and what improvements will we achieve after we implement  our sustainable action plans? S.A.F.E. Earth addresses this very important question and helps individuals take stock of and celebrate their progress through a number of program mechanisms, two such initiatives include:
·The Annual Sustainability Progress Report.  
All ""1-1"" Teams will be asked to share evidence of their progress by filling out a simple on-line survey. The data collected will be compiled throughout the year and published in an Annual Sustainability Progress Report. 
·Annual Sustainability Achievement Awards.  
Global and regional awards for top achievement in sustainable action will be awarded annually and celebrated widely.

FAQs·


Q:  When will the entire S.A.F.E. Earth program, products and web portal be complete and available to the public?
A:  The Development Team's goal is to complete the design and development of all apps within 6 months of the release of Indiegogo funds and then complete Beta Testing and final preparation for commercial release within a 2 month period following final design and development.  Therefore, our plan is to have the web portal and all apps ready for full commercial ""launch"" within 8 months, and no more than 10 months from release of Indiegogo funds.
Q:  Will your tech support app products be designed and available for different climate zones?


A: Yes, all tools and resources will be offered in the 2 major global Climate Zones: 1) Cold/Temperate, and 2) Tropical.  Further, most apps will uniquely address issues that are particular to urban & rural settings.


Q: What will be the price range for the various support app products once they are made available for sale?

A: Exact prices for all support products have not been set yet, given that price setting is difficult until final product design and development phase is underway (and we hope to raise sufficient crowd funds to move through this phase quickly). Nevertheless, our Team is committed to keeping all prices  affordable, and offering a wide range of product pricing -- including very low cost for introductory tools, such as the Sustainability Master Framework App.

<h3>Our Story</h3>My name is Sara and I am a student who has been offered an opportunity I have wanted to do for many years but haven't had the time or money. I decided upon graduation this would be the perfect opportunity for me to do something I always wanted to do before I start working on a full-time basis.<br/><br/>I have decided to join the mission created by Volunteer Eco Student Abroad (VESA) and aid indigenous communities in Ecuador.<br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>VESA has previously connected with many different communities around the world to discover what the people need most. The communities have requested the aid with building washrooms, creating a filter treatment system for fresh water, and teaching English in elementary schools. I plan to be doing all of this while my stay there.<br/><br/>The people in these communities live by a river and use it for everything, bathing, drinking, eating, washing etc. They are in dire need of washrooms for sanitary reasons.<br/><p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>In order for me to volunteer with VESA and provide these basic necessities the villages have asked for I need the funds to join. All of the money will be going towards paying for my flights, board and room, and food (program fees). If I do not reach my goal of $4,000 I will not be going this year, but perhaps another year when I have saved enough money to travel.<br/><br/>If I make over 50% of what my goal funds are, I will continue to work over-time and if I can make enough to pay for the rest I will.<br/><br/>If you have always wanted to contribute to helping a community far away but never had the time or money to do so I can share this experience with you.<br/><br/>Even a donation of a $1 would be very helpful! A collective power is much stronger then one large sum, and better for everyone.<br/><p><br/></p>

Hello and Welcome to Cajun/Creole Country!
NUNU'S Arts and Culture Collective is a 501(c)(3) non-profit arts organization dedicated to providing a stage/platform/gallery for creative living by facilitating community, economic, and artistic/cultural development. We are located in Arnaudville, Louisiana and our goal is to educate the public about the importance of the arts and the positive effects it has on preserving and promoting the culture of the Greater Acadiana area. 
        This is NUNU's now, but...
We need your support for the development of Village d' Art et Eco Parc, an expansion of our partnership with Nu Nu's.
The location is on the banks of Bayou Fuselier across the road from Nu Nu's Gallery on a pristine 1.75 acres site. 


The land opens up to fields with gorgeous views of sunrises and sunsets. Along Bayou Fuselier is a dense jungle of tropical vegetation providing the ideal setting for eco tent camping.
Your funds will restore this historical Singleton Lumberyard built in the early 1900'sthat joins the pristine terrain and bayou banks for the park. 

The former Singleton Lumberyard

<p>Our Intent­<br/><br/> We, Revolutionary Gardens and OASIS Project Development Group, are building a fully off-grid, solar heated, thermal-bubble insulated greenhouse, to produce fresh, organic fruits, vegetables and fish all year round. Beyond just growing food, we would like to educate and showcase to everyone how they can sustainably produce nutritious and yummy food for themselves. Our current commercialized food system is not sustainable. The cost of food production in this system is tied directly with the price of fossil fuels through transportation costs, chemical pesticides, and chemical fertilizer production. The burning of fossil fuels, and the use of chemical pesticides and chemical fertilizer are polluting the air, our land, our food and our water. Our OASIS greenhouse project, is one of the many solution focused approaches, to producing urban or near-urban agriculture, and paving the way to a cleaner and less wasteful economy.<br/><br/><br/> Who We Are<br/><br/> Please allow us to introduce ourselves, we are Revolutionary Gardens CSA Greenhouses. Welcome to our sustainable organic world of low-impact, high-intensity, near-urban food production. We have a passion for fresh, sustainable and locally grown food. If you are curious about where food comes from, or why it travels so far to get to our table, or you are interested in eating and living healthier or you love fresh produce, this is where you need to be. Gardening and food sharing builds stronger communities by bring friends and neighbours together for a common cause! Regardless of how you found us, we are living in dangerous times, where healthy, pesticide and chemical free food is uncommon. Join us to start a movement, that allows everyone to produce delicious, healthy, super-nutritious food, all year round!<br/><br/><br/> Our Vision<br/><br/> At Revolutionary Gardens, we believe that small diverse market farms are the answer to high quality produce for all. Because of their smaller size, these markets, can produce well cared for crops and distribute food locally. They can also respond to the needs of communities more quickly. Our long term vision is not only to produce fresh organic produce for local markets and food hubs, but also to educate, through an urban agricultural learning center where we showcase the latest advanced methods in food cultivation, and technology for efficient use of water, energy and time in producing organic vegetables and animal protein. We will be demonstrating the use of aquaponics, bioponics, and aeroponics in our learning centre. Aquaponic growing systems are shown to take half the time to grow crops to harvest with 10% as much water as traditional farming - yielding the most animal protein production recorded of all livestock commercially raised. On average 1 pound of fish protein is produced for every 1 ½ pounds of fish feed invested.<br/><br/><br/> Our Project<br/><br/> Revolutionary Gardens is a leading partner in the OASIS Project Development Group. OASIS stands for Organic Aquaponic Sustainable Integrated System. This project is a collaborative effort, whose mission is to increase local food security and to bring back local food sovereignty. We plan to achieve this by developing urban organic food growing communities and increasing urban food production through outreach, education and access to urban agriculture technology, training and support. Our other partners include Photonics (specialize in Renewable energy), Urban Crops (low cost, open source, urban agriculture technology), and LIFT (Low-Income Families Together), a Non-Profit Resource and Education Centre working on food security and social enterprises in vulnerable urban communities. Our latest project is a pilot test model greenhouse. This state-of-the-art passively heated Solaroof design consists of a 28ft x 56ft tunnel structure nestled inside a 32ft x 60ft structure to create a roughly 2ft thick void filled as needed, with biodegradable, non-toxic soap bubble foam. This allows the OASIS greenhouse to retain thermal energy captured from the sun during the day, and help maintain the system’s dynamic equilibrium throughout the night. This climate control technology will make it possible to grow organic plants and fish year round with minimal energy input. This leading edge technology, provides high-efficiency, high value, and long-term return on investment. In this final phase of building, we plan to install the solar cells, set up the bubble generator and to install the aquaponic systems. To make this fully off-grid and resilient pilot model a success, we need your assistance to raise $15,000, technically $16,129 to cover the fees deducted by Indiegogo.<br/><br/><br/> The Problems with Centralized Food and the Impending Crisis<br/><br/> We as a global community, desperately need to engage in a public discourse on the unsustainable practices of our current commercialized food system.  This system is always under threat for potential disruption and contamination. As a result of the lack of accountability, food poisoning, food shortages, and food wastes incidences occur on a regular basis. In this system food security is always an issue. For example, “trucked” in produce could exorbitantly increase in price with the price of fossil fuels, seasonal changes and natural disasters could interrupt our food supply, traditional mono crop farming year after year depletes the nutrients in soil leading to erosion and the need for artificial chemical fertilization which is also ""trucked"" in, and commercial ""conventional"" greenhouses burn massive amounts of fossil fuels to heat.<br/><br/> The irony is that greenhouses are now contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Is it nonsensical that the typical Canadian meal is transported 2000 km? The current global economy supplies an incredible array of foods to all corners of the earth, but does so at a high cost to the environment.<br/><br/> In today’s modern industrialized world, we have lost our once intimate relationship with food. I have come to realize that community starts with fundamentals of living, and nothing is more fundamental than food. In our fast paced, busy, urban life, we’ve not only become alienated from each other, but also from our food. With all this convenience, technology, abundance and prosperity, most of us don’t even know our neighbours by their first name. When is the last time your shook the hand of the person that raised the chicken you ate for lunch? It’s no wonder so many people take food security for granted, thinking there will always be plenty of it in the supermarket, or their favourite restaurant. Technology undoubtedly makes our lives easier, and connects us in ways our distant ancestors could only have dreamed of, yet most don’t realize that those same ancestors were connected by the food they produced and shared while celebrating life and kinship, in community.<br/><br/><br/> Our Solution<br/><br/> Technology has been referred to as a double edged sword. Like many things in life, it can be beneficial in some respects yet damaging in others. What if someone you’ve never met in person, connected with you through this new virtual community on the internet, and told you there was a way to bring back that connection with our food and our local community. Would you believe them? Would you even be aware of the need for it?  What you are about to discover is that agricultural equipment technology may have contributed to getting us in this predicament, but it’s shaping up to be our saving grace in these rather uncertain times. There is currently a greenhouse technology that allows your local food producers to supply you with fresh, nutritious, and amazingly, out of season, fruits and vegetables with virtually no fossil fuels or environmental impact. In fact, there are a myriad of emergent technologies that are making their way into workshop basements, backyards, and greenhouses in urban locales everywhere. These technological innovations are paving the way to a cleaner and less wasteful economy, and hopefully a cleaner ecosystem too. Some experts are calling this the new “green” economy. The most effective lifestyle choice you can make to promote this emergent economy, a cleaner environment <em>and</em> bill of health, is to choose wisely what you put on your plate. <br/><br/><br/> What do we mean by a green economy, you ask? Simply put, a green economy is low-carbon, resource efficient, and socially inclusive local to global management system. A few distinguishing features are :<br/><br/><br/> 1)  Efficient use of energy and other resources. For example, huge economic and environmental gains could be made if we had more energy efficient buildings and transportation.<br/> 2)  Use of renewable resources, like wind and solar, instead of non-renewable resources, such as coal and oil<br/> 3)  Application of greener manufacturing which is resource efficient and avoids the use of use toxic chemicals.<br/><br/> Urban Agriculture innovators like rooftop gardeners, aquaponic gardeners, and Small Plot Intensive (or Spin) farmers are working hard to reshape our local food growing, production and distribution. These innovators are not acting alone, they are simply the first ones reacting to a groundswell of different ideological shifts in public perception. Terms like foodie or “locavore” describe these trends, and are not only hip sounding, but are part of a whole new language being spawned by the need for food security. The Slow Food movement founded by Carlo Petrini, became an international association in 1989. It now boasts 85,000 members and offices in dozens of countries. Slow Food stresses the need for taste education as the best defense against poor quality and food adulteration, and incursion of fast food into our diets. It helps to safeguard local cuisines, traditional products, vegetable and animal species at risk of extinction. It supports a new model of agriculture, essentially permaculture, which is less intensive and healthier, founded on the knowledge and know-how of local communities. This is the only type of agriculture able to offer prospects for development to the poorest regions on our planet.<br/><br/><br/> Please help this dream manifest into a reality. Contribute today and tell your friends about us too! You can be sure your contribution will go towards supporting local urban and near-urban agriculture. Those who contribute $1000 or more will receive 15% discounts for life on all workshops or gala events to be hosted at this first OASIS greenhouse.<br/><br/> Thanks in advance for your support</p>

There is currently a greenhouse technology that allows your local food producers to supply you with fresh, nutritious, and amazingly, out of season, fruits and vegetables with virtually no fossil fuels or environmental impact. In fact, there are a myriad of emergent technologies that are making their way into workshop basements, backyards, and greenhouses in urban locales everywhere. These technological innovations are paving the way to a cleaner and less wasteful economy, and hopefully a cleaner ecosystem too. Some experts are calling this the new “green” economy. The most effective lifestyle choice you can make to promote this emergent economy, a cleaner environment and bill of health, is to choose wisely what you put on your plate.  What do we mean by a green economy, you ask? Simply put, a green economy is low-carbon, resource efficient, and socially inclusive local to global management system. A few distinguishing features are : 1)  Efficient use of energy and other resources. For example, huge economic and environmental gains could be made if we had more energy efficient buildings and transportation. 2)  Use of renewable resources, like wind and solar, instead of non-renewable resources, such as coal and oil 3)  Application of greener manufacturing which is resource efficient and avoids the use of use toxic chemicals. Urban Agriculture innovators like rooftop gardeners, aquaponic gardeners, and Small Plot Intensive (or Spin) farmers are working hard to reshape our local food growing, production and distribution. These innovators are not acting alone, they are simply the first ones reacting to a groundswell of different ideological shifts in public perception. Terms like foodie or “locavore” describe these trends, and are not only hip sounding, but are part of a whole new language being spawned by the need for food security. The Slow Food movement founded by Carlo Petrini, became an international association in 1989. It now boasts 85,000 members and offices in dozens of countries. Slow Food stresses the need for taste education as the best defense against poor quality and food adulteration, and incursion of fast food into our diets. It helps to safeguard local cuisines, traditional products, vegetable and animal species at risk of extinction. It supports a new model of agriculture, essentially permaculture, which is less intensive and healthier, founded on the knowledge and know-how of local communities. This is the only type of agriculture able to offer prospects for development to the poorest regions on our planet. Please help this dream manifest into a reality. Contribute today and tell your friends about us too! You can be sure your contribution will go towards supporting local urban and near-urban agriculture. Those who contribute $1000 or more will receive 15% discounts for life on all workshops or gala events to be hosted at this first OASIS greenhouse.

I have seen the highs and lows of what it is like to stand up for people and the Earth through my efforts. I hope to enlighten people through a TV series that I have written, <em>Environmental Presence, </em>on ways to help our Earth and our people aside from the justice system. Through explorations of religious and other spiritual methods derived through history as well as through scientific methods we will explore ways to heal the Earth and the people from man-made as well as natural contaminations and Earth's natural happenings.  Possibly we can even get confirmation that their are spirits that exist whom are interested in giving their thoughts to us on Earth's happenings that may match what the professionals of the scientific world tell us.</p>
<p>This campaign is very important to me as I hope to educate others through the episodes concerning the Earth, health, and religious/spiritual beliefs on how we are connected to the Earth and how different cultures have chosen to heal the Earth in their views.</p>
<p>Your contributions toward this project will allow us to continue forward in filming. We are featuring the band MR SPOON with their song written by Joel Heslop titled ""Shadow"" in the pilot.  We have extras of which need to be paid for their presence.

<h2>What is Simply Adventure?</h2>
<p>Niko and Katie are two climbers, spending 2013 living in a van and traveling around the country to advocate for<strong> conservation and positive land stewardship within the climbing and outdoor community</strong> - all while promoting the experience of adventure. </p>
<p>We've noticed two trends in the outdoor industry - first, that there is an exploding population of folks interested in getting outside and exploring the land (which is great). The second is a growing population of adventurers who don't quite understand how to treat the land (which isn't so great).</p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://themorningfresh.com/simplyadventure/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Simply Adventure</a> is going to create an engaging, interactive, inspiring resource to educate adventurers about how to form sustainable relationships with the outdoors.</strong> Rather than discouraging anyone from enjoying the outdoor space, we hope to help create a new generation of outdoorsmen who feel as strongly about protecting the land as they do about exploring it. </p>
<p>With strong social media influence in the outdoor industry, we have the experience and tools neccesary to reach a wide audience and achieve our goal of inspiring others to embrace a lifestyle that prioritizes sustainability and conservation - <em>but we need <strong>your</strong> help to fund our mission. </em></p>
<p>Over the course of the next year, we'll be aggregating the content and experiences needed to<strong> create the ultimate source of information for aspiring outdoor adventurers</strong>. First through real-time documentation via social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, as well as daily blog posts on <a href=""http://themorningfresh.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TheMorningFresh.com</a>.

<p>The costs of living on the road for a year are pretty hefty - but we've got that covered.

We've also been hoarding change in a glass jar we call, ""The Sushi Fund."" </p>
<p>But in order to achieve our goal of creating a digital and print resource for the adventure lifestyle, we need the technical equipment to fuel our mission. Your contributions will go directly towards camera and computer equipment, publication fees, and any costs associated with the promotion of our campaign to gain visibility. <strong>With $5000, we can confidently create a lasting movement to shape the future of the outdoor community. </strong></p>

<p>In return for your generous contributions, we want to reciprocate the love with a series of contributor perks, including personalized postcards from the road, limited edition t-shirts, and even the chance to come adventure with us during our journey.

<p>In order to combine the spirits of exploration and throwing caution to the wind, we are (perhaps regrettably) Team Marco Yolo. We are three dudes who live in New York City, who by the time of the rally will have each just turned 30, and who spend a lot of time cooking up harebrained ideas over platters of oysters. This time, we’re following through with one such idea.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>Mike</b></p>
<p>Mike Abdul is a recent transplant to New York City from Chicago. He is an intellectual property attorney and stand up comic. Mike used his legal expertise to draft the silly napkin contract that got this whole journey started. During the Rickshaw Run, he hopes to find at least $20 on the ground and shake hands with “Tunak Tunak” singer Daler Mehndi.</p>
<p><b>Brett</b></p>
<p>Brett Harmon is a New York City transplant by way of Chicago. He will have been 30 for just two weeks at the start of this adventure. Professionally, he is a real estate agent in Brooklyn, though he spends the vast majority of his time accruing and hoarding airline miles, driving across the country, riding his bicycle to the beach, and consuming raw and undercooked seafood.</p>
<p><b>Brendan</b></p>
<p>Brendan Sund very recently moved to New York City from the arid wastelands of Los Angeles. One night after a few drinks and a plate of oysters at the local bar, he signed a legally binding napkin contract and now has no choice but to go to India. He is not thrilled.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3><b>The Charity: Cool Earth</b></h3><p><b></b></p><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/661097/files/20140619133313-coolearthlogo.jpg?1403209993"" src="""" style=""""/></b></p><p></p>
<p>Cool Earth is the charity that works alongside indigenous villages to halt rainforest destruction.</p>
<p>We know that saving the rainforest isn’t a new idea. Managing to do it is.</p>
<p>Over the last 40 years, half the world’s rainforests have been destroyed. That’s why Cool Earth decided to go about things differently.</p>
<p>Cool Earth doesn't create reserves or put up fences. They don’t buy land. Instead, they put indigenous people back in control of the world’s most endangered rainforest.</p>
<p>These people have lived in the forest for countless generations. Their homes are now on the  frontline of deforestation. They have the most to lose from deforestation.</p>
<p>By building better incomes, better schools and better clinics, Cool Earth gives their partner villages the resources they need to keep their forest intact.</p>
<p>Cool Earth is now working alongside 65 rainforest villages throughout the world.</p>
<p>These partner villages are protecting over 350,000 acres of forest that lie directly in the path of chainsaws and bulldozers.</p>
<p>The clever part is that this forest is forming a shield to make the neighbouring forest inaccessible  to loggers – saving millions of acres of further forest.</p>
<p>At least 90% of each donation to Cool Earth goes directly to their projects. With this support, Cool Earth can put in place the simple steps that change the fate of at-risk rainforest and the lives of their indigenous partners.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3><b>What We Need</b></h3>
<p>In order to participate in the Rickshaw Run, we must first raise a minimum of $1,700 for the Cool Earth charity. That's our first big hurdle. But we could also use, and would much appreciate, your help with some of the other costs of the trip, which are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Registration fee</li>
<li>Flights to and from India</li>
<li>Visas</li>
<li>Lodging</li>
<li>Fuel</li>
</ul><p>The first $1700 we raise will go toward the minimum charity goal. Thereafter, we will use some of the funds for charity and some to help us turn this insane idea into reality.</p><p><br/></p>
<h3><b>How Else You Can Help</b></h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help. Here are some other ways we would love for you to lend a hand:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share! There are links on this campaign page to our various social media pages. All the exposure we can get helps, and we're sure you know somebody who would be interested in supporting and/or following along as we progress to and through India.</li>
<li>If you think you have any gear or supplies to donate, by all means, let us know. We will be traveling very light, but a camera or a tarp or anything else you think of may come in extremely handy.</li>
<li>We hope to hold a fundraising event of some kind between now and the end of the year. Follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for updates on our trip and upcoming parties.</li>
</ul><p>Tell your friends. Tell your family. And that's all there is to it. Thank you so much for reading, especially if you made it all the way down here. See you in India!</p>

The Charity: Cool Earth
Cool Earth is the charity that works alongside indigenous villages to halt rainforest destruction.
We know that saving the rainforest isn’t a new idea. Managing to do it is.
Over the last 40 years, half the world’s rainforests have been destroyed. That’s why Cool Earth decided to go about things differently.
Cool Earth doesn't create reserves or put up fences. They don’t buy land. Instead, they put indigenous people back in control of the world’s most endangered rainforest.
These people have lived in the forest for countless generations. Their homes are now on the  frontline of deforestation. They have the most to lose from deforestation.
By building better incomes, better schools and better clinics, Cool Earth gives their partner villages the resources they need to keep their forest intact.
Cool Earth is now working alongside 65 rainforest villages throughout the world.
These partner villages are protecting over 350,000 acres of forest that lie directly in the path of chainsaws and bulldozers.
The clever part is that this forest is forming a shield to make the neighbouring forest inaccessible  to loggers – saving millions of acres of further forest.
At least 90% of each donation to Cool Earth goes directly to their projects. With this support, Cool Earth can put in place the simple steps that change the fate of at-risk rainforest and the lives of their indigenous partners.
What We Need
In order to participate in the Rickshaw Run, we must first raise a minimum of $1,700 for the Cool Earth charity. That's our first big hurdle. But we could also use, and would much appreciate, your help with some of the other costs of the trip, which are as follows:

Registration fee
Flights to and from India
Visas
Lodging
Fuel
The first $1700 we raise will go toward the minimum charity goal. Thereafter, we will use some of the funds for charity and some to help us turn this insane idea into reality.
How Else You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help. Here are some other ways we would love for you to lend a hand:

Share! There are links on this campaign page to our various social media pages. All the exposure we can get helps, and we're sure you know somebody who would be interested in supporting and/or following along as we progress to and through India.
If you think you have any gear or supplies to donate, by all means, let us know. We will be traveling very light, but a camera or a tarp or anything else you think of may come in extremely handy.
We hope to hold a fundraising event of some kind between now and the end of the year. Follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for updates on our trip and upcoming parties.
Tell your friends. Tell your family. And that's all there is to it. Thank you so much for reading, especially if you made it all the way down here. See you in India!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>After coming back from COP 17, we will start working on creating a National Youth Advisory Board on Climate Change in India which will be the launchpad for several climate change activists to pursue climate policy and advocacy. Also, it will serve as the youth board to make policy recommendations to the Ministry of Environment in India in conjunction with other civil society organizations. India is one of the most vulnerable to climate change in Asia and we need many young people to fight and advocate for protecting the rights of  people affected and vulnerable to climate change in India.</p>

COMMUNITY | SUSTAINABILITY | ENVIRONMENT |  ARTS . . .Through application of these core concepts I will continue to build upon a pilot project launched in 2011 by planning and leading a hands-on long-term community development effort to alleviate poverty, food insecurity and environmental degradation in the rural areas of Takeo Province, Cambodia. This third campaign (version 3.0) will allow me to go back to Cambodia to serve the Wat Opot Children's Community (WOCC), the people in the rural villages surrounding WOCC, and - this time around - focus on building farmer training centers in adjacent villages.  All of which will be conducted within a 5 week timeframe starting mid to end of February 2013.  The initial fundraising campaign (version 1.0) and subsequent follow-up (version 2.0) results and progress may be viewed via my blog at http://briancambodiasustainability.tumblr.com/. I will continue to conduct three specific, on-going, long-term programs aimed at bolstering the viability of a rural population disenfranchised by the rapid development of a Cambodia shifting towards modernity:
Sustainable Agriculture and Food Security Training and Education benefiting ~30 adult village leaders and educators living with HIV/AIDS and in poverty 
Environmental and Teen Leadership Day benefiting children and teens (K-12) of WOCC and the surrounding villages living with HIV/AIDS and in poverty
Dance (Hip-Hop, Break-dancing, Jazz, Contemporary, etc.) Competition benefiting children and teens (K-12) of WOCC and the surrounding villages living with HIV/AIDS and in poverty
The three programs were developed after a needs assessment and follow-up performed in 2011 -2012 (v1.0) and 2013 (v2.0), bolstering this region by:Providing training for the rural communities to adopt small-scale subsistence sustainable agricultural techniques and knowledge sharing forum to share best practices; hence, alleviating food insecurity and achieving food sovereignty free from external conventional agriculture forces (i.e. multi-national corporate chemical and/or GMO seed companies)Engaging the youth of the rural communities through the arts (dance) and crafts (fun environmental related acitivities), which not only makes them stewards of their communities in the near term, but, also, provides leadership, planning and organizational skills supplementing their primary and secondary education, all of which is necessary for their success in the medium and long-termIn other words, together we can and are ""CHANGING THE COURSE""FUNDING AND TRANSPARENCYFOR AS LITTLE AS $10 YOU COULD FUND:

Get Byoearth to the home to do workshops, consulting, and help us launch
Bring documentarian Cameron Zohoori to the home to film and photograph the project and the kids
Acquire most of the materials needed to build the infrastructure
If we reach $4,500, we will be able to:

Get all of the building materials and worms needed for the project at the intended scale
Get our first wave of packaging materials for product distribution
Begin placing collection bins around the community and in homes

We're almost there!
[ CVoH ]                  [ Facebook ]                 [ Twitter ][ Background ]Finca, meaning farm, is the first of the Raising Esperanza project series - a series of well-designed small business initiatives, managed and run by a Honduran staff to put Children's Villages of Honduras (CVoH), a home for the displaced children of Honduras, closer to its goal of self-sustainability. Agriculture is at the cultural and economic core of Honduran daily life, so we decided to look there first for potential impact and change.  After some research and initial legwork in Valle de Ángeles, where CVoH is located, we discovered the following:
Rural food systems are largely self-contained in Honduras, which means most produce of Valle de Ángeles comes from within a 20-mile radius.
Aerable land is very limited, so common practice is to strip land of nutrients, clear cut forests for fertile soil, and repeat.
Chemical pesticides and fertilizers are a relatively new phenomenon, and therefore are misunderstood, and vastly misused.
Beyond the negative health impact these chemicals have on food being eaten, they leech into waterways.
Trash is often collected in piles and indiscriminately burned, which produces unavoidable thick patches of black smoke.
The situation seems overwhelming, but after looking at the central issues surrounding harsh chemicals, pollution, and land depletion, something suddenly clicked, and we decided to turn to a technology that is cutting-edge and ancient all at once...  ...Enter the ever humble worm.Yes, you heard right.[ Worms ]Worms are hard workers, solving all kinds of problems one bite at a time.  When we provide them with an ideal environment (e.g., a pile of garbage), they in turn provide the following:
Nutrient rich, organic fertilizer
""Tea"" (fertilizer + water + oxygen) which is loaded with microbes and acts as an organic pesticide
More worms!
Worms can eat and process more than 1/2 their own weight in a day.  We know what you're thinking, and sure, a worm may not weigh much, but when we're talking about tens of thousands of pounds of worms, the trash-to-treasure potential is truly staggering.[ CVoH ]                  [ Facebook ]                 [ Twitter ][ Here's how it works ]
Build four worm compost containment bins.  These bins will house the worms and compost at different stages

Collect crop waste and other biodegradables from farmers, and the greater Valle de Ángeles area.

Recycle waste.  Send plastics and metals to the recycling center.  Convert biodegradables into products that restore and revitalize the soil that grows the food that feeds the children and the rest of Valle de Ángeles.

Sell compost, ""worm tea,"" and worm starter kits to nonprofit organizations that promote sustainable agriculture development.  Nonprofits distribute those products to farmers in the region.

Educate on composting methods and the benefits of compost through free workshops for the Valle de Ángeles community.

Document the whole project through film and photography.

Finca has already begun.  After successful gardening and composting for the past three years, we are ready to bring this service to the town. [ What We Need & What You Get ]

Project Director - Scroll down to learn more about Vahid.  This will cover travel, lodging, and the economic burden of leaving work for 6-8 months.  


Videographer - We have a documentarian who will be in Honduras to film and document the project launch and its impact on the community.  We need your help to cover travel, lodging, filming, and editing.


Construction Materials - We have to buy blocks, cement, and wheelbarrows to build four rectangular containment systems, 15'x5'x4', and a simple roof to keep rain and scavengers out.


Byoearth - Byoearth is an incredible company based out of Guatemala that has been operating large worm composting systems for the past 7 years.  They are a key component to getting Finca off the ground, and we need help getting them to CVoH from Guatemala.


Labor - We are hiring two people to help with construction of our containment systems - laying blocks, cement, building the roof, etc.


Chipper/Shredder - A chipper machine breaks down large waste into smaller pieces.  By increasing overall surface area of the waste, we can ultimately cut the trash to treasure time in half.


Misc. Equipment - Pitchforks, shovels, buckets, containers, etc.

<br/><div style=""text-align: justify;"">Dada mi preocupación y la de millones de personas en el planeta tierra de revertir esta tendencia, he decidido empezar el proyecto ""Un Millón Más"", cuyo objetivo principal es sembrar un millón de árboles con el apoyo de todas las personas a nivel mundial, mientras se genera un fondo para el desarrollo y estudio de soluciones ambientales.</div>

<p><i>Given my concern and the one of people all around the world to reverse this situation, I decided to start the project ""One Million more"", which consistent of planting one million trees with the support of the people inside and outside my country, while a fund for studies in environmental solutions is created.</i></p>
<div><i></i></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<br/><h3>¿Cómo Funciona?</h3>Cada persona alrededor del mundo tendrá la oportunidad de comprar un árbol (o varios) que será donado al proyecto, este dinero será utilizado para la siembra y mantenimiento de cada árbol hasta por un año, además, con un poco de conocimiento financiera se genera el aporte a nuevos proyecto.</div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">Expliquemos esto, el dinero entra a un fondo financiero (clasificación AAA) en donde se generan ganancias por rentabilidad entre 15 - 20 días mientras llega la oportunidad de sembrar tu árbol donado, esto se debe a que los sitios y los árboles deben tener unas preparaciones previas. A medida que el proyecto avanza y se van sembrando los árboles, el dinero generado a partir del fondo se empieza a acumular para que una vez se termine la siembra del millón de árboles haya suficiente capital para generar un centro de investigación en soluciones ambientales. </div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></div>
<div style=""text-align: justify;"">De esta forma, se logrará sembrar un millón de árboles con la ayuda de todos y, como una cascada, se generan ingresos para construir un nuevo centro de investigación cuyo nombre será Prograss (expuesto al final del vídeo).</div>

<div style=""text-align: justify;""><h3><i>How it Works</i></h3></div>
<p><i>Each person around the world will have the opportunity to buy a tree (or as many as they want) and this tree will be donated to the project. the money received will be use to plant and maintain the tree, and with little financial knowledge the donation will generate funds to new projects.</i></p>
<p><i>Let's explain this, the money is deposited in a financial fund of low risk (AAA Qualification) where will generate profit for 15 - 20 days while everything is prepared to plant the tree, the reason is that we need to organize the places and trees to be planted. While the project grows and more trees are planted, the money generated in the financial fund is being accumulated to create enough capital to create a research center of environmental solutions.</i></p>
<p><i>This way, the project will plant one million trees with the help of all of you and, like a waterfall, will generate income to build a new center for environmental research named Prograss.</i></p>

<h3>Qué Busco a Través de Indiegogo</h3>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">1. Con los recursos obtenidos se terminará de construir la plataforma virtual donde las personas podrán donar su árbol y tener el seguimiento de la campaña. </span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>2. Construir un vivero donde se germinen una parte de los árboles que se utilizarán en el proceso de re forestación. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>3. Conseguir los fondos para sembrar los primeros 2.000 árboles y darle fuerza en los medios a Un Millón Más. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>4. Recoger el dinero para que la compañía pueda sobrevivir el primer año y poder vincularme con empresas privadas que deseen invertir en campañas posicionadas y temáticas ambientales. </div>

<div>
<h3><i>What I am looking for through Indiegogo</i></h3>
<div></div>
</div>
<p><i>1. With the funds collected I will finish the web page of the project where the people will have the opportunity to donate and follow the progress of ""One Million More"".</i></p>
<p><i>2. Build a greenhouse to germinate some of the trees that will be used in the reforestation.</i></p>
<p><i>3. To get the donation to plant 2.000 trees and hire advertising.</i></p>
<p><i>4. What I want through indiegogo is to get the money needed to survived the first year of the project to create record to convince private companies to support ""One Million More"".</i></p>
<div></div>
<div> <h3>¿Dónde se realizarán las siembras?</h3>Las siembras se realizarán es espacios rurales y urbanos, previamente seleccionados en el departamento del Valle del Cauca, con las debidas autorizaciones de las instituciones respectivas, garantizando su existencia bajo el cuidado de la ciudadanía y sin que vayan a generar daños a causa del tipo de especie sembrada.

En las ciudades se busca devolver el verde a las carreteras, parques y lindero de ríos (que a falta de material vegetal suelen desbordarse en temporada de lluvias). </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Las siembras se realizarán junto a los Scouts, Voluntarios del proyecto y con los colegios de la región en forma de concienciar a los jóvenes sobre la temática ambiental.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Este proyecto es la base para poder empezar a cambiar el mundo. Si bien un millón de árboles requiere una gran cantidad de dinero (USD 11 x 1 MM = USD 11 MM), tan solo se requieren USD 10.000 para arrancar. Con este fondo se generarían los medios virtuales para la plataforma de donación y seguimiento de toda la campaña por parte de los ciudadanos del mundo, además de poder construir el vivero donde germinarán gran parte de los árboles a utilizar, la otra parte de los árboles se originarán de los viveros existentes en la ciudad que están dispuestos a vincularse.</div>

</div></div>","Mi nombre es Sebastian Zapata, ciudadano de Cali, Colombia. Este bello país, al igual que el resto del mundo, se está viendo afectado por la tala de árboles y la disminución de las áreas arborizadas. 
Dada mi preocupación y la de millones de personas en el planeta tierra de revertir esta tendencia, he decidido empezar el proyecto ""Un Millón Más"", cuyo objetivo principal es sembrar un millón de árboles con el apoyo de todas las personas a nivel mundial, mientras se genera un fondo para el desarrollo y estudio de soluciones ambientales.


My name is Sebastian Zapata and I live in Cali - Colombia. This beautiful country  just like all the world it's being affected for  the deforestation.
Given my concern and the one of people all around the world to reverse this situation, I decided to start the project ""One Million more"", which consistent of planting one million trees with the support of the people inside and outside my country, while a fund for studies in environmental solutions is created.



¿Cómo Funciona?Cada persona alrededor del mundo tendrá la oportunidad de comprar un árbol (o varios) que será donado al proyecto, este dinero será utilizado para la siembra y mantenimiento de cada árbol hasta por un año, además, con un poco de conocimiento financiera se genera el aporte a nuevos proyecto.

Expliquemos esto, el dinero entra a un fondo financiero (clasificación AAA) en donde se generan ganancias por rentabilidad entre 15 - 20 días mientras llega la oportunidad de sembrar tu árbol donado, esto se debe a que los sitios y los árboles deben tener unas preparaciones previas. A medida que el proyecto avanza y se van sembrando los árboles, el dinero generado a partir del fondo se empieza a acumular para que una vez se termine la siembra del millón de árboles haya suficiente capital para generar un centro de investigación en soluciones ambientales. 

De esta forma, se logrará sembrar un millón de árboles con la ayuda de todos y, como una cascada, se generan ingresos para construir un nuevo centro de investigación cuyo nombre será Prograss (expuesto al final del vídeo).

How it Works
Each person around the world will have the opportunity to buy a tree (or as many as they want) and this tree will be donated to the project. the money received will be use to plant and maintain the tree, and with little financial knowledge the donation will generate funds to new projects.
Let's explain this, the money is deposited in a financial fund of low risk (AAA Qualification) where will generate profit for 15 - 20 days while everything is prepared to plant the tree, the reason is that we need to organize the places and trees to be planted. While the project grows and more trees are planted, the money generated in the financial fund is being accumulated to create enough capital to create a research center of environmental solutions.
This way, the project will plant one million trees with the help of all of you and, like a waterfall, will generate income to build a new center for environmental research named Prograss.










Qué Busco a Través de Indiegogo
1. Con los recursos obtenidos se terminará de construir la plataforma virtual donde las personas podrán donar su árbol y tener el seguimiento de la campaña. 


2. Construir un vivero donde se germinen una parte de los árboles que se utilizarán en el proceso de re forestación. 

3. Conseguir los fondos para sembrar los primeros 2.000 árboles y darle fuerza en los medios a Un Millón Más. 

4. Recoger el dinero para que la compañía pueda sobrevivir el primer año y poder vincularme con empresas privadas que deseen invertir en campañas posicionadas y temáticas ambientales. 


What I am looking for through Indiegogo


1. With the funds collected I will finish the web page of the project where the people will have the opportunity to donate and follow the progress of ""One Million More"".
2. Build a greenhouse to germinate some of the trees that will be used in the reforestation.
3. To get the donation to plant 2.000 trees and hire advertising.
4. What I want through indiegogo is to get the money needed to survived the first year of the project to create record to convince private companies to support ""One Million More"".

 ¿Dónde se realizarán las siembras?Las siembras se realizarán es espacios rurales y urbanos, previamente seleccionados en el departamento del Valle del Cauca, con las debidas autorizaciones de las instituciones respectivas, garantizando su existencia bajo el cuidado de la ciudadanía y sin que vayan a generar daños a causa del tipo de especie sembrada.

En las ciudades se busca devolver el verde a las carreteras, parques y lindero de ríos (que a falta de material vegetal suelen desbordarse en temporada de lluvias). 

Las siembras se realizarán junto a los Scouts, Voluntarios del proyecto y con los colegios de la región en forma de concienciar a los jóvenes sobre la temática ambiental.

Este proyecto es la base para poder empezar a cambiar el mundo. Si bien un millón de árboles requiere una gran cantidad de dinero (USD 11 x 1 MM = USD 11 MM), tan solo se requieren USD 10.000 para arrancar. Con este fondo se generarían los medios virtuales para la plataforma de donación y seguimiento de toda la campaña por parte de los ciudadanos del mundo, además de poder construir el vivero donde germinarán gran parte de los árboles a utilizar, la otra parte de los árboles se originarán de los viveros existentes en la ciudad que están dispuestos a vincularse.

El excedente del dinero para mi meta en indiegogo es para poder sembrar los primeros 2.000 árboles y poder generar mercadeo en el lanzamiento de la campaña. Por tanto, cada centavo recogido en esta campaña irá destinado a sembrar árboles, así que se logre la meta o no, el mundo tendrá nuevos árboles sembrados.


Un árbol puede que no cambie el mundo, pero puede cambiar la vida de muchas personas... La mía cambió cuando mis padres me llevaron a sembrar mi primer árbol, historia familiar que hoy recuerdo con amor...

Un árbol es una historia, ayúdame a sembrar un millón!

<h2>Welcome to the Yunus Emre farm ! Bienvenue a la Ferme Yunus Emre ! Yunus Emre ciftligi'ne Hosh Geldiniz ! ..</h2>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<h3><strong>TEXTE EN FRANCAIS APRES LE TEXTE EN ANGLAIS - PLUS BAS :O))))) .</strong></h3>

<h3>THE FARM</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Situated in South Turkey, in the Mediterrannean area, in the country of Mevlana – Sufi master, the farm is a3 hectare wide space dedicated to NATURE.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It aims at experiencing and sharing the Ancient Knowlege of Yoga, as well as the powerful tools of Permaculture.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>THE AIM OF THIS CAMPAIGN</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>It concerns the LOTUS POND, our WATER RESERVOIR.</h3>
<p>As a permaculture farm, the Yunus Emre farm’s design is based on permaculture, and according to permaculture, each important energy should be supplied by at least 2 sources, even 3.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now we are trying to finalise the WATER subject.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzwM8UGI4fY&amp;feature=youtu.be"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""LOTUS POND VIDEO"">See the “LOTUS POND” VIDEO HERE</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In 2008 we received drinkable water from the village, but as there is shortage every summer this water is not allowed for watering.</p>
<p>So we digged a drilling and  found good amount of water, however this water revealed to be salty from time to time.</p>
<p>On the other hand another important source of water is simply RAIN.</p>
<p>In this area the annual amount of rain is superior to that of UK !!!!  BUT rain only falls (heavily) during 4 months in winter.</p>
<p>So we had to find a way to HARVEST and STORE this rain.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>That is where the LOTUS POND came.</p>
<p>Digged also in 2008, it would be the perfect tool both to HARVEST RAIN WATER, and to provide a POOL for DRILLING WATER to REST and MIX with rain water thus becoming proper for watering.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Yet the Lotus pond remained empty during 2 years because we could not find any proper solution to cover the inside.</p>
<p>Finally, we put a “nylon” as we say in Turkey, a big large plastic, because it was cheap and quickly done.</p>
<p>Of course .. unfortunately it didnt last much ...</p>
<p>After only one year, the plastic revealed to be torn everywhere... Probably due to burning sun, strong winds, and ... lovely cats :o))</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So this time, we searched eventually  a durable, sustainable and ecological solution for the LOTUS POND.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>And we found the EPDM – Geomembrane as a very much reliable material.</h3>
<p>Totally ecological, sun and heat resistant, very solid and durable, it appeared to the BEST solution.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And we have been very pleased when a good company based in Antalya accepted to do the work in very convenient conditions:</p>
<p>Bringing the material, covering the pond with it, fixing everything as it has to be, (it needs real professionnal people for such a work)  finally delivering a “fully ready water pond” in a 3- 4 day work.</p>
<p>And most of all, the company’s manager accepted to complete the work in the next weeks, with ONLY A SMALL DEPOSIT.... the remaining money being given .. on the completion of this campaign ! (25 JUNE dead line)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>So you see how precious will be YOUR HELP and SUPPORT.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The cost of the work should be between 4200 / 4600 USD.</p>
<p>The farm's financial situation does not allow such an expense yet. Although it starts to bring some little incomes, the farm is not yet self sustainable financially speaking..</p>
<p>That is why we searched for FUNDING solutions and STARTED THIS CAMPAIGN</p>
<p>Aiming at raising an amount of 5000 USD to cover all expenses related to the LOTUS POND's LAST STEP .... </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>We do COUNT ON YOUR SUPPORT to help the LOTUS POND to be FINALISED and fullfill its multi functions, like a good “permaculture pond” should do:</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>-- Water harvesting – Rain (may be up to1200 mm/ year – on the pond’s surface of around 100 m2: it may bring 120 tons of good rain water)</p>
<p>-- Water storage- Rain water and Drilling water will be mixed so that drilling water looses it salinity and rests under the sky and open air</p>
<p>-- Watering of the fields- for the time being around 700 plants have been planted in both Moon and Sun gardens. The uphill position of the reservoir allows watering of most of them by GRAVITY thus saving energy.</p>
<p>-- Shelter for life- As soon as possible we shall try to put water –plants in the pond, both to create LIFE and to provide SHADE thus limit evaporation.</p>
<p>-- Fire fighting reservoir- The farm being surrounded by pine tree forest the area in summer is highly fire sensitive... the forest road to the pond must always be open .. just in case ..</p>
<p>-- Pool for kids- why not to let kid have some fun and play in water at some stage .. (maybe grown ups too ! )</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>So we all COUNT ON YOUR HELP to finalise this last step and have a proper WATER RESERVOIR lasting many many many years, (20 year garanty :o)) providing WATER for many many many plants trees bushes, allow the Yunus Emre farm to become a green oasis providing ABUNDANCE TO ALL.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>If however the total goal of the campaign would not be reached, we would still pay the works with the available money and borrow from other sources, even from banks :o(   if mandatory ... and maybe organise another campaign to finish to pay.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>I am thinking totally POSITIVELY and want to believe YOUR WILL HELP US.</h3>
<p> </p>
<h2>MANY WAYS YOU CAN HELP</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Financial support:</h3>
<p>according to your possibilities, whatever you can give will be MORE THAN WELCOME.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Transmitting, sharing:</h3>
<p>the more people know about the Yunus Emre farm’s water pond, the BETTER .. and if you write a note to your friends, relatives, collegues then it will definitely HELP A LOT</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Personal involvement:</h3>
<p>in addition you may wish to help the farm by involving your self in it in a way that would suit your capacities, preferences, ambitions, etc...</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<p>-- VOLUNTEERING: nice way to share the life in the farm by helping and learning, giving and receiving</p>
<p>-- ADVANCED VOLUNTEERING: lets say you have come for volunteering and you like so much the project that you feel like joining us .. this is also possible and of course would have to be discussed in ""live""..</p>
<p>-- PARTNERSHIP: again . .lets say you have come here and found the place, the project and activities so wonderful that you wish to CREATE something HERE TOO, to REALISE YOUR OWN PROJECT here, well .. this could be also possible either in the farm itself (renting a part of the fields of ex) or in the neighborhood ... . there is a HUGE potential in this region , we just have to be CREATIVE, POSITIVE, INVENTIV, and Permaculture and Yoga's tools may HELP us a LOT in creating a beautiful community ...</p>
<p>For all these suggestions of course .. contact us.. come and we talk !! </p>
<p>Discussions are OPEN .. and we are happy to study any  case, and talk with you any time about any idea you may have :o)</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>PERKS</h2>
<h2> </h2>
<p>There is a Chinese saying iike:</p>
<h3>“if you want to live happy, walk with 2 bags: one to give, one to receive”</h3>
<p>So likewise you will maybe give something to the farm, and for sure you will also RECEIVE.</p>
<p>Detais about the perks are below.</p>
<h3><strong>One perk however is not mentionned, it is the one you will feel in your HEART.</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Because BY GIVING we actually RECEIVE.</strong></p>
<p>            <em>""Generosity brings happiness at every stage of its expression.<br/>              We experience joy in forming the intention to be generous.<br/>                 We experience joy in the actual act of giving something.<br/>                    And we experience joy in remembering the fact that we have given.""<br/>                                       -The Buddha</em></p>

<p> </p>
<p>Quelle que soit la situation il y aura toujours les pratiques de l’écologie du Yoga, telles que le<strong> HAVAN</strong> – Ancienne cérémonie du FEU, le Chant du <strong>Mahamrityunjaya mantra</strong>, le Mantra qui guérit, apportant énergie bienfaisante a tous les êtres... Ceci car ces pratiques véritablement accordent notre être vibratoire aux vibrations Cosmiques, créant ainsi  l’harmonie et la paix dans tout notre être.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>C’est pourquoi la ferme Yunus Emre est un lieu oula PAIX INTERIEURE peut être réellement ressentie, vécue. De plus on y apprend des techniques puisantes qui permettent de maintenir cette bonne énergie et une positivité inébranlable dans notre vie de tous les jours.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>La ferme Yunus Emre est un lieu qui donne une CHANCE POUR L’EVOLUTION et est dédiée aux GENERATIONS FUTURES qui devront gérer le monde de demain.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>LE BUT DE CETTE CAMPAGNE</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>C’est la finalisation du bassin du LOTUS, notre réservoir d’EAU.</h3>
<p>Dans une ferme <strong>PERMACULTURE</strong>,et  la ferme Yunus Emre est  conçue selon la permaculture,  chaque énergie importante ( et l<strong>’EAU VITALE</strong> en est vraiment une ! ) devrait être fournie par au moins<strong> 2 voire 3</strong> sources.</p>
<p>Ainsi nous essayons d’appliquer cette regle de redondance est source de stabilité et sécurité (comme en avion ou les circuits sont doublés ou triplés !!!)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzwM8UGI4fY&amp;feature=channel&amp;list=UL"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vous pouvez voirla VIDEOdu BASSIN DU LOTUS- BUT DELA CAMPAGNE ici. En anglais (tres facile !)</a></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Un bref historique :</p>
<p>En 2008 nous avons reçu l<strong>’EAU de la commune</strong>, mais comme tous les étés la sécheresse impose des restrictions, l’eau est souvent coupée, et si elle ne l’est pas, l’arrosage est de toutes façons interdit.</p>
<p>C’est pourquoi nous avons fait un<strong> forage</strong> qui a donné de l’eau vers80 m. L’eau est belle et abondante même en fin d’été, en revanche elle est souvent SALEE et impropre a l’arrosage..</p>
<p>Cela fait donc déja 2 sources pour l’EAU </p>
<p>La troisiéme sera la<strong> PLUIE.</strong></p>
<p>En effet dans cette région méditerrrannéenne qui souffre de sécheresse tous les étés, en fait il pleut .. plus qu’en Bretagne ! mais les pluies ne tombent (de façon torrentielle) que durant les 4 mois d’hiver.</p>
<p><strong>C’est pourquoi il faut un RESERVOIR pour COLLECTER cette eau et l’utiliser durant l’été.</strong></p>
<p>Ainsi nous avons creusé le<strong> BASSIN DU LOTUS</strong> également en 2008.</p>
<p><strong>A la fois pour recueillir l’EAU DE PLUIE, mais aussi pour permettre a l’EAU DU FORAGE (tirée avec une pompe électrique) de REPOSER a l’air et de se mélanger a l’eau de pluie ainsi perdant sa salinité.</strong></p>
<p>N’ayant rien trouvé de mieux, nous avons d’abord opté pour une bache de plastique afin de couvrir l’intérieur du bassin qui a ainsi fonctionné trés bien .. seulement Un an !! le plastique s’est retrouvé perforé en mille endroits.. probablement par le soleil, le vent , et surtout .. les petits  chats !! :o))</p>
<p>C’est pourquoi cette fois nous sommes décidés a mettre un revêtement <strong>DURABLE, ECOLOGIQUE, SAIN</strong> et c’est l<strong>’EPDM Géomembrane</strong> qui nous a été conseillée par tous les amis qui sont dans le milieu..</p>
<p>Alors tout s’est enchainé trés vite..</p>
<p>Curieusement alors que nous cherchions sans rien trouver depuis des mois, une compagnie de pose d’EPDM a surgi , basée a Antalya (tout prés) , acceptant de faire le travail rapidement AVANT L’ETE.</p>
<h3>Et SURTOUT SENSIBLE ALA SITUATION FINANCIERE DIFFICILE DE LA FERME, LE MANAGER DE LA COMPAGNIE A ACCEPTE UN PETIT ACOMPTE SEULEMENT (correspondant aux donations reçues) ET ATTENDRA LA FIN DE LA COLLECTE POUR RECEVOIR LE SOLDE !!!</h3>
<p>Le patron de cette compagnie, Monsieur Aziz Icke m'a dit être ""Touché"" par le projet de la ferme Yunus Emre, c'est pourquoi ce geste.</p>
<h3><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XIcVFVr-74"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Vous pouvez voir la seconde video sur le travail réalisé – la premiere partie : ICI</a></h3>
<p>Ce travail est une premiere partie en effet les BORDURES restent a aggrandir et fixer. Ceci se fera avant l’hiver.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Le<strong> cout total</strong> de cette étanchéité sera entre 4200 / 4600 USD ( équivalent a <strong>3200 /3600 €)</strong> l’incertitude restant a cause de la bordure non terminée.</p>
<p>Afin de couvrir les taxes et frais de cette campagne ... nous avons du poser l’objectif a 5000 USD soi<strong>t 3800 €</strong> </p>
<p>C’est une somme trés importante pour la ferme Yunus Emre.. et probablement pour la plupart d’entre nous ! Mais avec un tel revêtement qui est <strong>garanti 20 ans.</strong>.. le bassin du Lotus pourra remplir ses multi fonctions durant beaucoup plus que 20 ans ....</p>
<h3><strong>Et sera un vrai bassin permaculture permettant de :</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>-- RECUEILLIR ET STOCKER L’EAU DE PLUIE</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>-- STOCKER L’EAU DU FORAGE POUR QU’ELLE REPOSE ET PERDE SA SALINITE</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>-- ARROSER LES JARDINS DES DEUX TERRAINS DELA FERME</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>-- ETRE UN ABRI DE VIE AQUATIQUE (plantes poissons grenouilles ...)</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>-- SERVIR DE RESERVOIR D EAU CONTRE LE FEU</strong></h3>
<h3><strong>-- ET DE BASSIN DE BAIGNADE POUR LES ENFANTS !! (et peut etre aussi pour les grands ! :o)</strong></h3>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>‘C’est donc un important INVESTISSEMENT que ce BASSIN DU LOTUS, et nous comptons sur VOUS TOUS pour nous aider a rendrela FermeYunusEmre autonome au niveau de l’EAU, capable d’approvisionner toutes les plantations en eau, et espérons de devenir une OASIS de verdure qui apportera des BIENFAITS et ABONDANCE a chacun :o)</strong></p>
<p>Si toutefois le but final (5000 USD – 3800 €) n’était pas atteint, nous utiliserions l’argent récolter pour payer ce que nous pourrons payer, et si besoin emprunterons a d’autres sources.. et peut etre même des banques ...

TEXTE EN FRANCAIS APRES LE TEXTE EN ANGLAIS - PLUS BAS :O))))) .
 ------------------------------------------------------------
THE FARM
 
Situated in South Turkey, in the Mediterrannean area, in the country of Mevlana – Sufi master, the farm is a3 hectare wide space dedicated to NATURE.
 
It aims at experiencing and sharing the Ancient Knowlege of Yoga, as well as the powerful tools of Permaculture.
 
So like this you may come to the Yunus Emre farm for a Satyananda Yoga seminar,(next in MAY-  HERE)  for a yogic retreat (see HERE) .. you may also come for a Permaculture design course.(next in OCTOBER)
You may join the life of the farm as a volunteer, helping learning and sharing ...(info HERE)
You may also organise your own yoga seminar in the Yunus Emre farm. (see the flyer in the Gallery ""Guest seminars"" or here Guest Seminar )
 
Whatever the case there will always be Yogic Ecological practices like Havan, ancient fire ceremony, Chanting of Maha mrityun jaya mantra the “HEALING” mantra which provides healing energy for the benefit of all beings, for these  very practices attune our vibrations to the Cosmic vibrations, allowing harmony and peace in our entire being.
 
So Yunus Emre farm is a place where you can really experience INNER PEACE, as well as learn powerful tools which will help you to keep this positive healing ENERGY in your own life.
(A lot of pics may be found also in the GALLERY showing the farm from the very beginnings until now :o))
Yunus Emre farm aims at giving a CHANCE FOR EVOLUTION and is specially dedicate to the FUTURE GENERATIONS who will have to manage the world tomorrow.
 Here is an article by Theresa Day in TODAY ZAMAN in 2010 at the beginnings of the farm- things have evolved - but the spirit of the project remains same
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
THE AIM OF THIS CAMPAIGN
 
It concerns the LOTUS POND, our WATER RESERVOIR.
As a permaculture farm, the Yunus Emre farm’s design is based on permaculture, and according to permaculture, each important energy should be supplied by at least 2 sources, even 3.
 
Now we are trying to finalise the WATER subject.
 
See the “LOTUS POND” VIDEO HERE
 
In 2008 we received drinkable water from the village, but as there is shortage every summer this water is not allowed for watering.
So we digged a drilling and  found good amount of water, however this water revealed to be salty from time to time.
On the other hand another important source of water is simply RAIN.
In this area the annual amount of rain is superior to that of UK !!!!  BUT rain only falls (heavily) during 4 months in winter.
So we had to find a way to HARVEST and STORE this rain.
 
That is where the LOTUS POND came.
Digged also in 2008, it would be the perfect tool both to HARVEST RAIN WATER, and to provide a POOL for DRILLING WATER to REST and MIX with rain water thus becoming proper for watering.
 
Yet the Lotus pond remained empty during 2 years because we could not find any proper solution to cover the inside.
Finally, we put a “nylon” as we say in Turkey, a big large plastic, because it was cheap and quickly done.
Of course .. unfortunately it didnt last much ...
After only one year, the plastic revealed to be torn everywhere... Probably due to burning sun, strong winds, and ... lovely cats :o))
 
So this time, we searched eventually  a durable, sustainable and ecological solution for the LOTUS POND.
 
And we found the EPDM – Geomembrane as a very much reliable material.
Totally ecological, sun and heat resistant, very solid and durable, it appeared to the BEST solution.
 
And we have been very pleased when a good company based in Antalya accepted to do the work in very convenient conditions:
Bringing the material, covering the pond with it, fixing everything as it has to be, (it needs real professionnal people for such a work)  finally delivering a “fully ready water pond” in a 3- 4 day work.
And most of all, the company’s manager accepted to complete the work in the next weeks, with ONLY A SMALL DEPOSIT.... the remaining money being given .. on the completion of this campaign ! (25 JUNE dead line)
 
So you see how precious will be YOUR HELP and SUPPORT.
 
The cost of the work should be between 4200 / 4600 USD.
The farm's financial situation does not allow such an expense yet. Although it starts to bring some little incomes, the farm is not yet self sustainable financially speaking..
That is why we searched for FUNDING solutions and STARTED THIS CAMPAIGN
Aiming at raising an amount of 5000 USD to cover all expenses related to the LOTUS POND's LAST STEP .... 
 
We do COUNT ON YOUR SUPPORT to help the LOTUS POND to be FINALISED and fullfill its multi functions, like a good “permaculture pond” should do:
 
-- Water harvesting – Rain (may be up to1200 mm/ year – on the pond’s surface of around 100 m2: it may bring 120 tons of good rain water)
-- Water storage- Rain water and Drilling water will be mixed so that drilling water looses it salinity and rests under the sky and open air
-- Watering of the fields- for the time being around 700 plants have been planted in both Moon and Sun gardens. The uphill position of the reservoir allows watering of most of them by GRAVITY thus saving energy.
-- Shelter for life- As soon as possible we shall try to put water –plants in the pond, both to create LIFE and to provide SHADE thus limit evaporation.
-- Fire fighting reservoir- The farm being surrounded by pine tree forest the area in summer is highly fire sensitive... the forest road to the pond must always be open .. just in case ..
-- Pool for kids- why not to let kid have some fun and play in water at some stage .. (maybe grown ups too ! )
 
So we all COUNT ON YOUR HELP to finalise this last step and have a proper WATER RESERVOIR lasting many many many years, (20 year garanty :o)) providing WATER for many many many plants trees bushes, allow the Yunus Emre farm to become a green oasis providing ABUNDANCE TO ALL.
 
If however the total goal of the campaign would not be reached, we would still pay the works with the available money and borrow from other sources, even from banks :o(   if mandatory ... and maybe organise another campaign to finish to pay.
 
I am thinking totally POSITIVELY and want to believe YOUR WILL HELP US.
 
MANY WAYS YOU CAN HELP
 
Financial support:
according to your possibilities, whatever you can give will be MORE THAN WELCOME.
 
Transmitting, sharing:
the more people know about the Yunus Emre farm’s water pond, the BETTER .. and if you write a note to your friends, relatives, collegues then it will definitely HELP A LOT
 
Personal involvement:
in addition you may wish to help the farm by involving your self in it in a way that would suit your capacities, preferences, ambitions, etc...
Examples:
-- VOLUNTEERING: nice way to share the life in the farm by helping and learning, giving and receiving
-- ADVANCED VOLUNTEERING: lets say you have come for volunteering and you like so much the project that you feel like joining us .. this is also possible and of course would have to be discussed in ""live""..
-- PARTNERSHIP: again . .lets say you have come here and found the place, the project and activities so wonderful that you wish to CREATE something HERE TOO, to REALISE YOUR OWN PROJECT here, well .. this could be also possible either in the farm itself (renting a part of the fields of ex) or in the neighborhood ... . there is a HUGE potential in this region , we just have to be CREATIVE, POSITIVE, INVENTIV, and Permaculture and Yoga's tools may HELP us a LOT in creating a beautiful community ...
For all these suggestions of course .. contact us.. come and we talk !! 
Discussions are OPEN .. and we are happy to study any  case, and talk with you any time about any idea you may have :o)
 
PERKS
 
There is a Chinese saying iike:
“if you want to live happy, walk with 2 bags: one to give, one to receive”
So likewise you will maybe give something to the farm, and for sure you will also RECEIVE.
Detais about the perks are below.
One perk however is not mentionned, it is the one you will feel in your HEART.
Because BY GIVING we actually RECEIVE.
            ""Generosity brings happiness at every stage of its expression.              We experience joy in forming the intention to be generous.                 We experience joy in the actual act of giving something.                    And we experience joy in remembering the fact that we have given.""                                       -The Buddha

Bienvenue a la ferme Yunus Emre !
LA FERME
Située dans le sud de la Turquie, en région méditerrannéenne, dans le pays de Mevlana. Maître Soufi- createur des Derviches Tourneurs.
La ferme est un espace de 3 hectares dédicacés a la NATURE. 
Son rôle est d’offrir la possibilité de vivre et de partagerla Connaissance du Yoga, ainsi que les outils puissants dela Permaculture.
Ainsi vous pouvez venir a la ferme Yunus Emre pour un Séminaire de Satyananda Yoga (prochain trés bientot avec Sannyasis Atmatattwa et Brahmananda ICI) , pour une retraite « style de vie yoguique » (infos ICI) , aussi pour un cours de Design permaculture (PDC)(prochain en Octobre avec Saviana Parodi- ICI)
Vous pouvez également passer quelques jours ou plus en tant que volontaire, apprenant, partageant, échangeant avec nous l’expérience de la vie a la ferme Yunus Emre (voir les infos ICI)
Vous pouvez aussi organiser votre Propre Séminaire de Yoga, venir avec votre groupe.(voir documentation sur la ferme et info Séminaires invités ICI)
 
Quelle que soit la situation il y aura toujours les pratiques de l’écologie du Yoga, telles que le HAVAN – Ancienne cérémonie du FEU, le Chant du Mahamrityunjaya mantra, le Mantra qui guérit, apportant énergie bienfaisante a tous les êtres... Ceci car ces pratiques véritablement accordent notre être vibratoire aux vibrations Cosmiques, créant ainsi  l’harmonie et la paix dans tout notre être.
 
C’est pourquoi la ferme Yunus Emre est un lieu oula PAIX INTERIEURE peut être réellement ressentie, vécue. De plus on y apprend des techniques puisantes qui permettent de maintenir cette bonne énergie et une positivité inébranlable dans notre vie de tous les jours.
 
La ferme Yunus Emre est un lieu qui donne une CHANCE POUR L’EVOLUTION et est dédiée aux GENERATIONS FUTURES qui devront gérer le monde de demain.
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
LE BUT DE CETTE CAMPAGNE
 
C’est la finalisation du bassin du LOTUS, notre réservoir d’EAU.
Dans une ferme PERMACULTURE,et  la ferme Yunus Emre est  conçue selon la permaculture,  chaque énergie importante ( et l’EAU VITALE en est vraiment une ! ) devrait être fournie par au moins 2 voire 3 sources.
Ainsi nous essayons d’appliquer cette regle de redondance est source de stabilité et sécurité (comme en avion ou les circuits sont doublés ou triplés !!!)
 
Vous pouvez voirla VIDEOdu BASSIN DU LOTUS- BUT DELA CAMPAGNE ici. En anglais (tres facile !)
 
Un bref historique :
En 2008 nous avons reçu l’EAU de la commune, mais comme tous les étés la sécheresse impose des restrictions, l’eau est souvent coupée, et si elle ne l’est pas, l’arrosage est de toutes façons interdit.
C’est pourquoi nous avons fait un forage qui a donné de l’eau vers80 m. L’eau est belle et abondante même en fin d’été, en revanche elle est souvent SALEE et impropre a l’arrosage..
Cela fait donc déja 2 sources pour l’EAU 
La troisiéme sera la PLUIE.
En effet dans cette région méditerrrannéenne qui souffre de sécheresse tous les étés, en fait il pleut .. plus qu’en Bretagne ! mais les pluies ne tombent (de façon torrentielle) que durant les 4 mois d’hiver.
C’est pourquoi il faut un RESERVOIR pour COLLECTER cette eau et l’utiliser durant l’été.
Ainsi nous avons creusé le BASSIN DU LOTUS également en 2008.
A la fois pour recueillir l’EAU DE PLUIE, mais aussi pour permettre a l’EAU DU FORAGE (tirée avec une pompe électrique) de REPOSER a l’air et de se mélanger a l’eau de pluie ainsi perdant sa salinité.
N’ayant rien trouvé de mieux, nous avons d’abord opté pour une bache de plastique afin de couvrir l’intérieur du bassin qui a ainsi fonctionné trés bien .. seulement Un an !! le plastique s’est retrouvé perforé en mille endroits.. probablement par le soleil, le vent , et surtout .. les petits  chats !! :o))
C’est pourquoi cette fois nous sommes décidés a mettre un revêtement DURABLE, ECOLOGIQUE, SAIN et c’est l’EPDM Géomembrane qui nous a été conseillée par tous les amis qui sont dans le milieu..
Alors tout s’est enchainé trés vite..
Curieusement alors que nous cherchions sans rien trouver depuis des mois, une compagnie de pose d’EPDM a surgi , basée a Antalya (tout prés) , acceptant de faire le travail rapidement AVANT L’ETE.
Et SURTOUT SENSIBLE ALA SITUATION FINANCIERE DIFFICILE DE LA FERME, LE MANAGER DE LA COMPAGNIE A ACCEPTE UN PETIT ACOMPTE SEULEMENT (correspondant aux donations reçues) ET ATTENDRA LA FIN DE LA COLLECTE POUR RECEVOIR LE SOLDE !!!
Le patron de cette compagnie, Monsieur Aziz Icke m'a dit être ""Touché"" par le projet de la ferme Yunus Emre, c'est pourquoi ce geste.
Vous pouvez voir la seconde video sur le travail réalisé – la premiere partie : ICI
Ce travail est une premiere partie en effet les BORDURES restent a aggrandir et fixer. Ceci se fera avant l’hiver.
 
Le cout total de cette étanchéité sera entre 4200 / 4600 USD ( équivalent a 3200 /3600 €) l’incertitude restant a cause de la bordure non terminée.
Afin de couvrir les taxes et frais de cette campagne ... nous avons du poser l’objectif a 5000 USD soit 3800 € 
C’est une somme trés importante pour la ferme Yunus Emre.. et probablement pour la plupart d’entre nous ! Mais avec un tel revêtement qui est garanti 20 ans... le bassin du Lotus pourra remplir ses multi fonctions durant beaucoup plus que 20 ans ....
Et sera un vrai bassin permaculture permettant de :
-- RECUEILLIR ET STOCKER L’EAU DE PLUIE
-- STOCKER L’EAU DU FORAGE POUR QU’ELLE REPOSE ET PERDE SA SALINITE
-- ARROSER LES JARDINS DES DEUX TERRAINS DELA FERME
-- ETRE UN ABRI DE VIE AQUATIQUE (plantes poissons grenouilles ...)
-- SERVIR DE RESERVOIR D EAU CONTRE LE FEU
-- ET DE BASSIN DE BAIGNADE POUR LES ENFANTS !! (et peut etre aussi pour les grands ! :o)

‘C’est donc un important INVESTISSEMENT que ce BASSIN DU LOTUS, et nous comptons sur VOUS TOUS pour nous aider a rendrela FermeYunusEmre autonome au niveau de l’EAU, capable d’approvisionner toutes les plantations en eau, et espérons de devenir une OASIS de verdure qui apportera des BIENFAITS et ABONDANCE a chacun :o)
Si toutefois le but final (5000 USD – 3800 €) n’était pas atteint, nous utiliserions l’argent récolter pour payer ce que nous pourrons payer, et si besoin emprunterons a d’autres sources.. et peut etre même des banques ... (pas glop.. :o(  .. ou alors nous organiserons une autre campagne pour finir de payer.
JE VEUX RESTER RESOLUMENT POSITIVE ET CROIRE A VOTRE SOUTIEN ET VOTRE AIDE.
----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
VOICI LES DIFFERENTS MOYENS DE NOUS AIDER :  (Car il n’y a pas qu’avec l’argent !)
 
Apport financier en fonction de vos possibilités .. quoi que vous pourrez donner sera réellement BIENVENU !  (même 5 ou 10 euros !)
 
TRANSMETTRE – PARTAGER – FAIRE CONNAITRE : C’est aussi un moyen trés important en ce que d’une part cela permet a plus de gens de connaitre la ferme et sa situation périlleuse ( !) – en cela n’HESITEZ pas a transmettre.. faire connaitre .. rappellez vous toujours que LES GENS AIMENT AIDER . :o)
""La Générosité apporte le bonheur a toutes les étapes de son expression.
Nous ressentons de la Joie lorsque nous formons l'INTENTION d'être généreux,

Et l’autre aspect est que cela augmente le taux d’activité du site de la campagne (qui est appelé « gogofactor ») et qui permet d’avoir une meilleure PROMOTION de la campagne auprés des médias et autres sites...
INVESTISSEMENT PERSONNEL: Vous pourrez voir plus bas que différents niveaux de participation sont proposés, depuis le “volontariat” jusqu’au “partenariat” ou “volontaire avancé” ... ainsi il y a beaucoup de façons d’aider..
Et si vous avez d’AUTRES IDEES, n’hésitez pas a nous les faire connaitre, nous sommes ouverts a toutes discussions échanges partages..
 
CADEAUX (""perks"")
 
Il y a un proverbe Chinois qui dit:
« si tu veux vivre heureux, proméne toi avec deux sacs. L’un pour donner, l’autre pour recevoir. »
Ainsi, si vous donnez quelque chose a la ferme, c’est certain vous allez aussi RECEVOIR.
Et les détails sur les cadeaux qui vous seront offerts sont plus bas sous la rubrique « PERKS » aussi en français.
Ceci dit un « perk » n’est pas explicité : c’est ce que vous sentirez dans votre COEUR : car en DONNANT, en fait on RECOIT.

of Thousands</b></h1>
<p>For the past three
years, 1,000 farmers have been growing <i>hundreds</i>
<i>of thousands </i>of Jatropha trees in
southern Haiti.<span>  Why?  Because the seeds from these trees
produce oil so rich it serves as a straight replacement for diesel fuel.  Yes, that means you can run your car,
truck or farm machinery on it.  </span></p>
<p>These trees are now
mature and ready for harvest, and Darin and Kelly need you for the final step –
to bring the proper presses to Haiti to extract the oil.</p>
<p>Jatropha doesn’t just
produce clean fuel.<span>  It produces
jobs – thousands of them – plus, a cleaner atmosphere and dignity for the
farmers.  In a nation like Haiti that

<p>From previous research, we know that turtle doves changed their diet between the 1960s and the 1990s, from the seeds of arable plants to the grains of cultivated crops.  At the same time, the number of breeding attempts per pair of turtle doves per year has dropped.  Over the past four years, we have collected data from turtle doves breeding in the UK that will allow us to see whether this change in turtle dove diet is related to breeding success, and whether by providing food in the right way we can reverse the fortunes of this diminutive dove - but we need your help.</p>

</div><div> <p></p>
<p>Since the start of this research project in 2011, new molecular tools have been developed which will allow us to find out what turtle doves are eating by looking at the DNA in faecal samples.  But these state of the art techniques are expensive: £5,000 would allow us to analyse the 144 faecal samples collected over the four years of this research - samples from both adult and nestling turtle doves (92 samples), as well as small numbers of samples from other dove and pigeon species.  As well as what turtle doves are eating, we could then find out:</p>
<p>- whether certain foods help nestling turtle doves grow faster</p>
<p>- whether the switch in turtle dove diet observed in the 1990s has led to turtle doves sharing the same food resources as other (larger and more common) doves and pigeons</p>
<p>- whether certain foods are associated with infection by the protozoan parasite <i>Trichomonas gallinae</i>, which causes the disease trichomonosis and has been linked to mortality in both adult and nestling turtle doves.</p>

<p>Second, we will analyse the 144 faecal samples by extracting DNA from each sample, identifying the section of DNA in which we are interested, and submitting the samples to sequence this DNA using Next Generation ion torrent sequencing.  This will cost £3,500 and will allow us to compare the sequences from the faecal samples to our reference library so we identify the species of seed present within each faecal sample.</p>

What We Need & What You Get
 
Since the start of this research project in 2011, new molecular tools have been developed which will allow us to find out what turtle doves are eating by looking at the DNA in faecal samples.  But these state of the art techniques are expensive: £5,000 would allow us to analyse the 144 faecal samples collected over the four years of this research - samples from both adult and nestling turtle doves (92 samples), as well as small numbers of samples from other dove and pigeon species.  As well as what turtle doves are eating, we could then find out:

Laboratory analysis will take place at Cardiff University, in a laboratory with much experience of this type of research.  Use of reagents and consumables (pipette tips, plasticware, etc) will cost £300.
Firstly, we will need to build a reference library of DNA sequences from seeds available to turtle doves.  This will cost £1,200 for the 139 seed species we have identified. The reference library will be publicly available when we have completed our research so that other researchers can use it in the future.

If we don't reach our target of £5,000, we can still analyse some of our 92 turtle dove samples, providing valuable knowledge - but with your help, we can achieve our goal of analysing all 144 samples.

    The Impact By providing more information about what turtle doves are eating and whether certain foods are 'better' for turtle doves than others, we can recommend ways in which to provide this food.  This could be through large-scale deployment of certain plants within agri-environment options, which will guide farmers to provide good feeding habitats for turtle doves on their land.  It might be that householders can provide the food that turtle doves need, through supplementary feeding in gardens, or through smaller-scale planting of certain plants in a quiet corner of their garden.
The results of this research will be publicised via social media, and through press releases from all partners involved with this work (RSPB, Natural England, Cardiff University).
By funding this research, you can contribute directly to turtle dove research and conservation.

Risks & Challenges
 The samples we need in order to carry out this research have already been collected.  The laboratory within which this work will be carried out is the best in the country at carrying out this kind of research. The team involved in this work have the expertise to ensure that the results of the work have the maximum impact on policy, and that the results are publicised in order to reach the widest possible audience.

Here's a short film to give you a brief overview of the project and why it is important:


Palm Oil.....Can be Sustainable!

The palm oil industry is widely criticized for having serious impacts on the environment and its native inhabitants. Two of the most serious of these are deforestation to make way for plantations and the associated loss of habitat for endangered species. Other impacts include soil erosion, air pollution, soil and water pollution, and contribution to climate change (WWF, 2014). 
The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) is perhaps the most significant attempt to mitigate these impacts, aiming ""to promote the growth and use of sustainable palm oil through co-operation within the supply chain and open dialogue between its stakeholders"" (RSPO, 2014). Through their certification system which tackles the issues associated with palm oil, the product can gain a far more favorable image in the marketplace. Follow this link to read the RSPO Principles and Criteria for Sustainable Palm Oil Production (2013).
Whilst our product cannot single-handedly resolve all of the industry's environmental issues, it can go a long way towards helping. Through using the waste EFBs as opposed to letting them rot, methane emissions are reduced, as is potential contamination of waterways. If EFBs are burnt then their valuable energy content is wasted and there is the risk of uncontrolled fires. In the long term, it is hoped that our product can contribute to the reduction of deforestation, due to a change in the mindset of palm oil plantation owners, from profit through expansion, to profit through increased efficiency.
One major contribution we can make now, is to help the palm oil industry become a player in mitigating climate change through its potential to help provide a sustainable and cleaner alternative to fossil fuels.

Coal......Putting Instant Gratification Above the Future of the Planet

The graph below shows investment in fossil fuels continuing to dwarf investment in renewable energy. 'Investors are putting short-term rewards ahead of the long-term health of the planet' (Walsh, 2014). To avoid the potentially catastrophic and irreversible effects of raising the planet's temperature by just 2 degrees Celsius, the International Energy Agency estimates that another $10.5 trillion needs to be invested in clean energy by 2030 (Walsh, 2014).
(Global and U.S. investment in fossil fuels dwarfs investment in renewable energy, Walsh, 2014)Global coal consumption has never stopped increasing. Since the beginning of the 21st Century, it has been the fastest growing global energy source its use increasing 60% between 2000 and 2012 (International Energy Agency, 2014). Currently, over 40% of the world's electricity is produced by coal and 70% of all steel production depends on coal (World Coal Association, 2014). 
This growth has been driven largely by developing economies, in particular China and more generally Asia.This map shows the huge increase in coal use in Asia between 1980 and 2010 (US Energy Information Administration, 2014) (1 short ton = 0.90718 metric tons). 
In Malaysia, imports of coal grew nearly ten times between 1992 and 2012, from 1485 KTOE to 14,220 KTOE (Suruhanjaya Tenaga (Energy Commission), 2014, p.23) and coal's importance in Malaysia's electricty generation mix also grew. In 1992 coal provided 13% of total generation. In 2012 it had grown to providing 41% of generation (Suruhanjaya Tenaga (Energy Commission), 2014, p.30).
Despite this, there are still 1.3 billion people across the world without access to electricity (World Coal Association, 2014) and as population continues to rise, as will demand for energy. Pressures on agriculture to sustain the population will mean increasing agricultural waste products and further increasing pressure to enhance its sustainability. This all highlights the already vast, and growing opportunity for our product in the marketplace.

                                                                    (It's the real deal, BUT....it has a closed carbon cycle)Although the burning of bio-coal does release carbon dioxide (CO2) it works in a 'closed-loop' cycle. The biomass takes sunlight and CO2 from the atmosphere to grow and create energy. This is then eventually released back in to the atmosphere via decay or combustion. Our process simply speeds this cycle up and so long as the biomass keeps regrowing, the loop remains closed.  This is very different to the CO2 from fossil fuels which have been in the ground for millions of years. If we weren't to use them today, their carbon wouldn't naturally be released. Thus burning them increases the net amount of carbon in the atmosphere.
        (Our product has a 'closed-loop' carbon cycle)Whilst the energy content of our torrefied biomass is around the same as coal, it gives off no sulfur emissions and produces significantly less ash. Coal ash contains toxic heavy metals such as lead, mercury and arsenic, whereas biomass ash contains none of these.  As of 2010, it has been calculated that the biomass available from the palm oil industry in Malaysia holds the energy potential of 37,000 KTOE/Y (Kilo-Tons Oil Equivalent/Year, 1 KTOE = energy contained equivalent to 1000 tons of oil).
EFBs alone contribute over 9500 KTOE/Y to this figure (Pei Qin Ng et al., 2012, p.59) which is enough energy equivalent to replace over 13.5 million metric tons of coal every year - that's about two thirds of the coal Malaysia imports. Just think if we could use all the other kinds of waste too!
(EFBs at a Palm Oil Mill)Our process takes waste EFBs and uses torrefaction to upgrade them in to a highly calorific fuel source. The substance produced is then pelletised to form a product that is easy to ship, hydrophobic and energy dense.
The bio-coal produced can then be used in place of, or co-fired with coal, anywhere that coal is currently used, for example in power plants, or in boilers to create heat (Kiel et al., 2008). No modifications are needed to switch to this fuel allowing it to replace coal straight away with no additional investment by the end user.
The product has a calorific value of 20-24 Mj/kg, comparable to that of lignite coal (see table below for comparison) and, like coal, it is hydrophobic (Kiel et al., 2008). Bio-coal can be sold and traded on the open market, and has a value similar to that of coal, if not slightly higher due to its sustainable and renewable qualities.
(A Comparison of the Properties of Torrefied Biomass Pellets and Coal)Neither torrefaction nor pelletisation of biomass is a new concept. The process of torrefaction has been around since World War II but until now has not been an economically viable proposition. But we've finally got it! And used in combination with each other we can produce a fuel that could revolutionise the energy market!
With our engineering background and experience in designing energy efficient solutions for businesses we see this project as having far reaching potential once our first unit is up and running.

We need $280,000 to fund the construction of our initial torrefaction unit in Malaysia.  Around $200,000 of this will be used to purchase the actual components of the machine and have it constructed. The remainder of the funding would cover the costs of running the unit for the first few months, including rent of a warehouse and wages for local staff.
This unit will provide us with a turnover through sales of fuel and help us to generate sales of further units by enabling us to show other businesses and investors a commercial operation using their waste to produce a valuable commodity. Based on our conservative estimates, the unit should have a pay back period of just over one and a half years, and a break even analysis suggests we would need to sell around one third of our achievable output.Any funds that fall short of what we need will still go a long way towards construction.
We have the parts ready to be ordered in China where it will be built, and even
with partial funding we may still be able to go ahead. 
The unit will employ local staff, benefitting local communities and  as sales of units bring new income
streams to other businesses, further employment opportunities will be created. We already have a local engineer raring to go!
Previously, our group has successfully designed, built and installed a
coconut oil mill in a remote village in Sabah, Malaysia. 
(Constructing the Coconut Mill in Sabah)This has enabled the
local people to up-skill and be employed in a small industry that has increased
their standard of living.  
(Local Employees at the Coconut Mill)We have also completed a number of studies on
behalf of various NGOs and companies based in Asia and New Zealand.  
Our aim is for this to be the first of many projects, taking us wherever
agriculture creates vegetable waste...rice husks, sugar cane stalks, palm oil
fronds, empty fruit bunches... and 
bringing the world cleaner, sustainable fuels and more efficient
businesses.
Even if you cannot donate we would love to have you on board, spreading the
news about our project. 
We’re excited and we hope you are too!

<p><strong>Project Summary</strong></p>
<p>My name is Oksana Lane. For the past 20 years, I have been conducting wildlife research around the world through Biodiversity Research Institute. While working in marine and coastal environments (Mediterranean Sea, Long Island New York, Maine, Massachusetts, and Mexico), I have witnessed firsthand the startling amount of plastic and other trash floating in the ocean or accumulated on the shoreline, and the resulting consequences--dead birds, turtles, and other marine life from the plastic debris and chemical contamination from the toxic chemicals that leach out of the plastic debris.</p>
<p>The 2017 eXXpedition through the Caribbean Islands is the basis for a powerful, important, and timely research project with a strong outreach component. We will travel to five countries including Grenada, Barbados, St. Lucia, Dominica, and Antigua to coordinate meaningful events and activities including beach clean ups, workshops, school presentations, day sails for local residents, and meetings with government officials and conservation groups to work toward a healthier future for the region.</p>
<p>As part of the scientific team on the eXXpedition voyage, I will survey wildlife and collect samples to test for heavy metals and other toxic chemicals. In addition to the research conducted, I will help foster our relationships with local communities throughout the region.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $10,000 for scientific research, lab analysis, supplies, and outreach materials. Our activities on board the boat include: 1) manta trawl sampling and observations for plastic pollution; 2) water sampling to test for persistent organic pollutants (POPs); 3) nano plastic sampling; 4) sampling of human hair and market fish for mercury analysis; 4) surveys of marine mammals and seabirds.</p>
<p>eXXpedition creates the energy for change. The approach of taking novice sailors and a diverse range of skilled women to study ocean plastics and toxics is unique. Participating women on the voyage come from all over the world and will gain the experience to become an eXXpedition ambassador in their own country and community. The benefit to everyone includes cleaner oceans and beaches that we all can enjoy, healthier fish to eat, and greatly reduced wildlife casualties.</p>
<p>If you can't contribute financially, you can help in other ways: clean up your own local beaches, reduce your use of plastic products, spread the word to others about this crowdfunding site.

Why row the Arctic Ocean:
“Do not go where the path may lead; go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.” -Ralph Waldo Emerson
Because we want to show first-hand the impact that global warming has had on the Arctic Ocean (foreshadow: it's melting fast). Our film will chronicle this record setting expedition and showcase the effects of Arctic global warming. Each member of our team is doing the row for slightly different reasons, but we all agree that the exploratory nature of Arctic Row and the science associated with the expedition make it highly compelling and worthwhile.
Arctic Row's Science: 
For science, Arctic Row has partnered with Adventurers and Scientists for Conservation and Professor Russell Hopcroft of the University of Alaska Fairbanks to conduct research on the role of whale olfaction in feeding habits in the Arctic Ocean and collect plankton samples to increase understanding of this key food source for marine mammals.
For mankind, our team of four will set a Guinness Book Record and complete one of the world's last great firsts: A non-stop, unsupported crossing of the Arctic Ocean by rowboat in July 2012. We will explore the unknown and advance the mettle of man. Arctic Row is a 30-day expedition in July 2012 to row 1,100 miles across the Arctic Ocean.

Meet The Rowers:

from left to right: Collin, Scott, Paul, and Neal
 
Rower Collin West: breathes inspiration, eats adversity and smiles in the face of what others call danger.  (He simply calls it opportunity.) As a national champion adventure racer and Crossfit World Games competitor he fills his leisure time with an MBA from the Kellogg School of Management (same as Paul) and was recently awarded the prestigious Kauffman Fellowship. Later this year, Collin is marrying his soul-mate & sweetheart. His bride-to-be is a fellow brainiac and inspirational tour de force…also a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader & Miss Texas winner.  Enough said.
 
Rower Scott Mortensen: is an adventure filmmaker, marketing whiz and social entrepreneur who spearheads profitable ventures for stakeholders, people and the planet — the elusive, triple-bottom-line.  He's worked at orphanages in Russia, shot documentaries in Thailand, built community centers in Fiji, practiced social enterprise in Honduras and joined disaster relief teams in Haiti. Scott thinks that anyone can climb Mount Everest, bike across the US or row across an ocean. He's personally completed two of those three feats.  ""The real challenge is to inspire everyone around you while you do it.  Getting people to 'think different' isn't just a tagline, it's my life mission."" Scott has only two items left unchecked on his bucket list. One of them is to produce a film/book project that sparks lasting global change. The time is now. And this is the project.
 
Rower Paul Ridley: Our calm, capable, team leader and long-distance rowing mad-man. In honor of his mother, Katherine Raub Ridley, 25 year-old Paul rowed for hope across the entire Atlantic ocean in 87 days. He was the youngest American to ever pull off such a feat. ""I'm exhausted. Overwhelmed with all the excitement from my arrival,"" Ridley told CNN. ""Physically feeling good but will be feeling a lot better when the soreness starts to heal and once that happens I will be back to fundraising because cancer research is still in need of funding, so we still have a lot of work to do."" Surprisingly, Paul's motto is not, never give up.  It's give it all up.  Leave nothing behind.  Spare no reserve of body, mind or spirit in making this world a better place, right here, right now.
 
Rower Neal Mueller: is the closest thing to a real life Bruce Wayne aka Batman that we could find.  We'd love to tell you more but we can't.  Really, we can't.  Okay fine: Neal lives on one of the most famous streets in the world (Lombard Street in San Francisco).  Almost as famous as he is.  He works a full-time product management job yet was the 120th person in the world to climb all of the 7 Summits, including Mount Everest unguided.  He's also swam the English Channel, rowed from San Francisco to Sacramento and San Francisco to Petaluma.  He has over 3,000 mentions in the press but not one of them tells you who he really is, how he pulls everything off, or most importantly, where he parks the batmobile.

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>""Silango"" means 'a place where there is a natural collection of water'. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Changes in rainfall patterns in Kenya recently have resulted in alternating periods of heavy rains and sever drought. The droughts have lasted up to two years and devastated wildlife and the Samburu people. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Open Water Reservoirs will literally save the lives of people and animals for decades to come.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<p>You can read about the Francomb family and their wonderful local projects at Olmalo.org. We are specifically helping with their Silango Water Project, which aims to build 60 open water reservoirs over a ten year period, thereby providing clean water within a 30 minute walk of every Samburu homestead.  </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $25,000 to build one reservoir. If we raise $50,000, or if others take on our cause or trip later in the year and raise another 25k, we build another reservoir. The Samburu people are nomadic, and animals like to meander too.  The more reservoirs the better.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Our group is a little smaller than I'd hoped, so we each need to raise as much as possible. I've set a goal of $2500 here, but really I'm hoping to personally raise $10,000. Apparently, it's hard to get people to spend money and time on a risky difficult endeavor and require them to raise money while doing it. Who knew? I did not get that memo!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>No matter what you can donate, I will thank you personally. If you can donate $100, you'll be invited to Dumbo for a soiree. $500 will get you a video from the mountain, personally saying 'thanks!""</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>$1000 is the best deal, it will get you a weekend in Woodstock at one of my lovely rental homes in the spring of 2012. Spring fling!  </p>

The Impact
""Silango"" means 'a place where there is a natural collection of water'. 

Changes in rainfall patterns in Kenya recently have resulted in alternating periods of heavy rains and sever drought. The droughts have lasted up to two years and devastated wildlife and the Samburu people. 

Open Water Reservoirs will literally save the lives of people and animals for decades to come.

You can read about the Francomb family and their wonderful local projects at Olmalo.org. We are specifically helping with their Silango Water Project, which aims to build 60 open water reservoirs over a ten year period, thereby providing clean water within a 30 minute walk of every Samburu homestead.  


What We Need & What You Get
We need to raise $25,000 to build one reservoir. If we raise $50,000, or if others take on our cause or trip later in the year and raise another 25k, we build another reservoir. The Samburu people are nomadic, and animals like to meander too.  The more reservoirs the better.

Our group is a little smaller than I'd hoped, so we each need to raise as much as possible. I've set a goal of $2500 here, but really I'm hoping to personally raise $10,000. Apparently, it's hard to get people to spend money and time on a risky difficult endeavor and require them to raise money while doing it. Who knew? I did not get that memo!

No matter what you can donate, I will thank you personally. If you can donate $100, you'll be invited to Dumbo for a soiree. $500 will get you a video from the mountain, personally saying 'thanks!""

$1000 is the best deal, it will get you a weekend in Woodstock at one of my lovely rental homes in the spring of 2012. Spring fling!

<h2><strong>The Problem</strong></h2>
<p>As the world population increases and consumption accelerates, there is a significant and growing imperative for society to explore and develop new and innovative ways of constructing our homes and public buildings in such a fashion as to use our limited resources efficiently. Over the last few decades thousands of engineers, architects, designers and private inventors have been refining existing, or creating new, products and methods by which the construction industry overall can move towards more sustainable practices. As the industry moves forward however, the amount of information available grows exponentially and unfortunately many ideas go unnoticed because they can’t find a voice in the general tumult. What is needed is an open centralized source of information that is capable of creating organization where there is none and as a result helping users identify the products or ideas that most closely meet their needs for a new construction or renovation.</p>
<h2><strong>The Solution</strong></h2>
<p>At its most basic, what we propose to create is a directory listing of home construction products and ideas with links to the manufactures or distributors of those products. More accurately what we propose to build is a directory 2.0. Our website will be an organized listing of products; but will also incorporate informative aspects similar to a wiki site, allow for user reviews and questions similar to commercial sites like amazon.com orbackcountry.com and most importantly incorporate comparative metrics such as cost, warranties, or performance characteristics. Users will be able to filter the listings according to these comparative metrics in order to identify the products that fit their moral, economic, aesthetic and project specific needs.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 90px;""><img alt=""Users will be able to filter the listings in order to identify the products that fit their moral, economic, aesthetic, and project specific needs"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-qXXygPgSRa0/UFnlh-YoOdI/AAAAAAAAD5E/GIxaiqyo89I/s400/Grecoa%2520Quote.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Grecoa Quote""/></p>
<p>This idea was born out of frustration with the fact that there is no centralized site where this information can be had. Ultimately we want to see this become a resource that users can use to plan out their homes from the foundation up, take their preferences to a designer and / or architect and have them make all the pieces fit together to create high quality, environmentally friendly and beautiful structures.</p>
<h2><strong>The Website</strong></h2>
<p>We've been thinking about this site for the last six months putting together the list of features that will make it most useful.  First and foremost we want the information to be easy to access and understand.  That means the site will be only three layers deep.  Put another way, users can find the information they're looking for within three clicks.  Also, once on the product pages, the only information on display will be information about that product and user feedback &amp; questions. </p>
<p>Another core focus will be on maintaining a “clean” site aesthetic. Banner ads will be restricted to Founder's Messages. For the home page this means that the 10 major categories will be displayed on the left, and as the user moves their cursor over any of the categories a paragraph will be displayed in the center of the page to provide more information about that category along with a scrolling slide show of images illustrating the different products found within that category.  Below is a wirefram of the basic layout.</p>

<p>Finally, we want to make it easy to go from research to design and implementation.  This means customers will be able to tag products and ideas they like and share them with their architects, designers, or contractors.  If the user is a DIYer they'll be able to find a local distributor to buy the product(s) directly.</p>
<h2><strong>The Need</strong></h2>
<p>So we want to build this site, but we don't have the web development skills to create such a database heavy website nor the graphics design talent to create a truly beautiful and intuitive experience.  The $30,000 we are trying to raise will be used to build the website described above.  We need your help to make that a reality.</p>
<h2><strong>How You Can Help</strong></h2>
<p>Obviously if you are reading this, the primary reason you are here is to consider contributing to my idea.  If you do contribute; thank you very, very, very much!  I would ask you to go one step further regardless of whether or not you contribute.  Please help me spread the word about this idea so that others can learn about this idea and decide if they would like to donate.</p>
<p>If you dig the idea of my website and would like to make suggestions on features you would like to see, send me an email or post the comment here. If you are a web developer or graphics design artist I’d also like to hear from you.  I have talked with 3 different developers here in my local area but none of them have struck me as “perfect” for this project, I’m on the hunt for talent and vision!</p>
<h2><strong>The Future Website (aka Stretch Goal)</strong></h2>
<p>If we can raise more than $30,000, the next step in enhancing the site will be to create a simulation model that will use the performance criteria of each product selected to provide life cycle cost comparisons.  I would even like to build in the ability to use location specific data in the comparison.  </p>
<p>For example:  If you live in Arizona, and want to compare expected utility expenses for a conventional stick home with an adobe, or ICF home, all of which have different R-Values and construction costs.  How much will each hom cost initially, and what can you expect to pay in utlitities over the next 10 - 20 years if you keep the house at 70 degrees F year round?  </p>
<p>These estimations will be based on the information in the database and location specific temperature and utility rates.</p>
<p>Similar comparisons can be made for heating and air conditioning units, windows, insullations, even finishing surfaces in a home.  It's this kind of comparison that gets the engineer in me really excited.</p>
<p>In order to include this feature in the website from the get go, we will need hire additional coding / consulting services.  If we can raise $80,000 this feature will be added to the site within 12 months of launching the site.</p>
<p>Additionally, if we are able to hit the $80,000 funding mark, in addition to the perks listed, we will include everyone from the $50 level and up in an homage video where your name is said out loud, in public and / or in remote backcountry locations once a year for the next five years. </p>
