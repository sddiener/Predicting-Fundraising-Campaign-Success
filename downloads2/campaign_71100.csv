Overhead costs include but are not limited to: rental location, utilities and other bills, employee salaries, tools and equipment, etc.  Right now our resources are very limited. We have the manpower to make this possible but not all the tools that we need. Your donations will make this vision possible. We would be able to purchase the equipment we need and pay the overhead costs to keep this organization going. No donation is too small.The TeamOur team comprises nine individuals with diverse talents. We are college graduates with years of experience in the technical field. Our team consist of graduates holding degrees and numerous certifications in but not limited to Finance, Business Management, Computer Science, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Information Systems Management, Information Technology, System and Network Administration, and Information Security.Some of the Team Members – when we first got our locationGoalOur ultimate goal is to offer this service beyond the City of Orlando and the State of Florida. We would like to offer this service across the nation and eventually expand globally. We feel that everyone should focus on the important things that matter most to them while leaving the technical work to us. Together, we can truly make a difference.ServicesIf we meet our goal of $200,000, we’ll be able to offer the following services at no cost:

PC Repair

Remote Technical Support

Windows Desktop Support


Linux Desktop Support


OS X Desktop Support


Android Support on Mobile Devices


iOS Support on Mobile Devices


Data Recovery and Migration


Virus Cleanup


How-to Videos & Documentation

System and Network Monitoring


System and Network Administration


Repairs of Shipped Hardware


Web Design


Application / Software Development


Web Hosting and Email Services

Life After Campaign / GoalWhat happens after the campaign is met?The funding from our campaign will help us purchase the hardware and software we need to open up for business. The funding will also assist us in doing wholesale buy-ins for computing parts in order to repair the hardware that comes in for service. All profits obtained from the sale of any product goes towards supporting our mission and sustaining this organization. If your goal isn't met, what happens next?

Any funding we receive will assist us in many ways. We won't stop with our mission even if our goal isn't met. However, depending on the amount of funding received, only limited services will be offered until the appropriate funding can be allocated for future services.


How Else Can You Help?
Money isn't the only thing we need. Sure, it'll definitely help us purchase the items needed to offer the services we'd like to offer. However, we are open to accepting equipment as donations. We are in dire need of three new servers, network switches, workstations, two 1080p televisions for our ticketing queue and network monitoring, computer monitors, and more. Whatever you can do to help us is always appreciated!
Most importantly, spread the word!!! We don't only cater to our local community. We are looking forward to providing remote support as well. Share our campaign with as many people as  you can. 
Thank You!!!
Thank you in advance for allowing us the opportunity to serve you. We believe in our mission and we will move forward with our vision.

On the Edge Women In Business CLUB Founder - Margaret Jackson Small Business Coach and Silicon Valley/Bay Area Radio Show Host on AM 1220 KDOW Radio and AM 1100 KFAX .  ""My heart is sensitive toward the business and professional success of women throughout our world. I was compelled to do something that would give women access to a community, to business and professional resources 24/7, and platforms that I have the power and authority to share.  We are the Women Titans of the 21st century as we stand together, we win together through our business club support system.  It is our CLUB, your CLUB, and my CLUB""  


                                                        WATCH  OUR VIDEO


 Why we launched a Small Business WIB CLUB?  Women small business owners have lacked a consistent accessibility to much-needed business development resources and tools that would benefit their business and professional growth at an affordable cost, no cost, or very low cost on a day-to-day basis. The goal was to design an online/offline ecosystem of business resources, network activities & events, and advertising, marketing & branding, exposure, opportunities for women that own small businesses.  
The network center below is the current CLUB connection ecosystem of resources for club member access.  Each member receives a member number, login, and password providing them access to the entire CLUB's business resources & tools, direct networking opportunities, and building friendships with other professional women that face the same small business day-to-day challenges.  We are solving small business day-to-day challenges by keeping the CLUB website relevant.  

The On the Edge Women In Business CLUB is a model that provides online resources and activities for members-only through the club website portal.  The CLUB member benefits include but not limited to CLUB member discounts on event tickets, vendor booths, and opens the door to opportunities to, possibly, becoming presenters, radio guests, podcast presenters for additional reach and exposure. 
 CLUB Features include...  WATCH OUR VIDEO


When you become a member and are active using the above ecosystem you will begin to achieve new results for your business thereby developing your own ecosystem that provides support to your business and career.  If you want to improve your bottom-line join the club.    




                     




Access the CLUB resources anytime during the day or night.  Become a Local Chapter and enjoy local interaction and networking with women in your area (Board approval required).

Risks & ChallengesOur biggest risk and challenge is not meeting out 1000 membership goal.  If we cannot reach our expansion membership goal it will limit our ability to support women in small business and our next generation around the Nation.  Our target goal is not the finish line.  It is the beginning market, for us  to reach 10,000+ women within 3-5 years nationally and expand globally.  We began in Silicon Valley as a guide for us to examine our CLUB model.  It works for women in small business; if they work the CLUB and take full advantage of the resources.      If we can reach this goal it gives Business On the Edge Incorporated, and the On the Edge Women In Business CLUB a voice of leverage to advocate on behalf of the small business women of America and around the world.

“The Hybrid 3D Design Marketplace and 3D Printing Software Platform”    


Last November modelR was selected among thousands of projects to attend the Web Summit in Dublin, one of the biggest technology conferences in the planet. More than 30000 people  from all over the world. 

We are proud to say that our project had a warm welcome and many people showed interested in cooperating with us.


We had the chance to see other 3D printing related start-ups, to learn from them and the most important, to confirm that this field is growing rapidly.  




Currently the complexity of the software available to use a 3D printer makes it less appealing for a common user. Adding to that the fact that designers can not profit from their work and creativity. 

modelR simplifies the process to 3D print an object in few easy steps to bring this technology to everyone and makes it in a way that protects the designer, as the files are never downloaded from our servers.


                 
                   


























      

    
          

 
   





With modelR we will be giving to everyone, in a easy and intuitive way, the chance to use and enjoy the endless possibilities of a 3D printer. We will provide a 3D objects repository, designed by the best designers and, on the other hand, a repository of preset settings of the commercial 3D printers as well as its consumables.




In order to standardize modelR, and subsequently 3D printing, with need to count on the support of the 3D printer manufacturers as well as consumables manufacturers.





We have achieved a lot with very limited resources and we are very proud of that. We now come to a point where we need a final push to finalize and release. The funds we are requesting will be invested as follows:                        
             
                           

Even if we are unable to reach the target, the funds raised will still be invested in the project in the order  as shown in the chart above and the perks will be delivered as long as modelR becomes a tangible reality. 












3D printing world is the future now. The endless possibilities of this amazing technology will blow your imagination.
There is though a lot of work to do before we can consider this industry mature. And the main problems is the lack of standardization which keeps 3D printing out of reach of most of people. In order to overcome this obstacles we created ThinkR.
ThinkR is a company established by young entrepreneurs with a common vision: to develop a 3D printing system so intuitive that it will democratize the use of 3D printers and that can be utilized as the standard due to its potency, diversity of designs and its usability.

I've dedicated my entire life to skateboarding. It's not just a hobby or a fun way to blow off steam anymore. It grew beyond that long ago and has since become a way of life for myself and my friends. We eat, sleep, and breathe skateboarding. It's all we think of 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and we want to make Lexington's youth just as passionate about it. If you spend all of your spare time focused on skateboarding you don't have time to get into trouble and I'm living proof of that. I've been given many opportunities to mess my life up but because of skateboarding I was always too busy to bother.<br/><br/>I've been skateboarding for as long as I can remember and I realize how cliche that sounds but it's the truth. I honestly can't remember a time before skateboarding and it wasn't long after I discovered it that I realized I wanted to one day run my own skate shop. Everything about my life seems to draw me closer and closer to my passion. I want to run a successful business and this one has the potential to be something great but there's more to it than just that. Skateboarding saved me. It kept me out of trouble and gives me a reason to wake up every morning. I want to share my passion for skateboarding with a broader audience and that's why I started my YouTube channel (SkateSpeech) but it's still not enough. The digital connection with my subscribers is fantastic and I love interacting with them, giving them advice, and listening to their stories, but I crave something deeper and even more meaningful. I need real human interaction. I need to be able to see the way my advice affects people in real time. I want to help young skaters by providing them with a positive place to hang out, meet up with their friends, learn about skateboarding news and history, and buy quality skateboarding products from real skateboarders that respect their lifestyle. <br/><br/>With a skate park built by Team Pain coming to Lexington next year  there's no doubt in my mind that if I don't open up my shop soon someone else will open up their idea of a skate shop. I can't bear to think of what some suburban soccer mom looking for an afternoon job would bring to town so it's vital that I make this happen. I've made connections throughout my lengthy skateboarding and YouTubing careers that will allow for me to do great things for our community as a whole, not just the skateboarding community. There are several charitable organizations such as A.Skate an organization that uses skateboarding to help children with Autism that I'd like to work with as well as contests and demonstrations at the skate park when it opens. We fought for years to get this park built and the city has finally listened to us but free parks don't generate revenue. Skate shops on the other hand... do generate taxable income. For those that aren't aware Team Pain builds some of the best parks in the country and simply having one of their parks in your city makes it an instant road trip destination for skaters statewide, not just in our little city. It doesn't make sense to have such an amazing park without an equally awesome shop to keep the skaters on board.<br/><br/>That's where you come in. I jumped into this project feet first with a solid plan and plenty of money two years ago but things fell apart at the finish line. All I lack at this point is the inventory. I have literally everything else I need to open the doors tomorrow but because of some bad investments my money dried up and I got behind financially. Now I'm stuck in a lease and paying $400 a month on top of my personal bills and expenses and that makes it difficult to save enough money to buy what I need for the shop. I was hit and run literally days before selling the car to pay for my inventory. That left me with a totaled car that insurance wouldn't cover because highway patrol refused to follow up on the information I gave them AND a severe concussion. I lost all hope and quickly descended into a deep depression which was only worsened by a stressful living situation and roommates that could never pay their bills. The last straw was when I was unexpectedly fired from my job for standing up to a workplace bully in a respectful way. They claimed that I quit and because of that I wasn't able to collect unemployment. I searched for a job for 6 months scraping together what little money I could working odd jobs to get by and with the help from some amazing friends and my loving family I was able to get through it all without being homeless or missing too many meals, although many of them were just noodles. All the while I was uploading videos to YouTube in an effort to grow my audience because I knew this day was going to come eventually. I've got a good job now and I'm making decent money but I've dug my hole too deep and I can't afford to keep digging it deeper. I have a $500 loan to pay off which will come out of my tax money and then I'm officially back in the green, but with nothing to show for it because I've been paying $400 a month for the lease for 2 years and haven't made a penny yet. I can't afford to give up the location because it's perfect for what I'm doing. The size is right. The lease is right. The location is PERFECT. With $4,000 I could get my utilities turned on and stock the shop with enough product to get the ball rolling. This may be my last chance to make this happen. I'm getting discouraged after putting as much effort into this as I have. I know it will work because I have people contacting me about it on a regular basis. The kids want a shop and right now I'm letting them down which is breaking my heart. If you have the means to help get a small business up and running I urge you to contribute. If you can't contribute financially PLEASE take the time to share my campaign anywhere you think interested parties may be exposed to it. You can also check out my YouTube channel (SkateSpeech). Simply watching the videos helps me tremendously because I'm a YouTube partner (which means I make money off of the ads on my videos) and all of that money is going towards the shop as well. <br/><br/>Whether or not I meet the goal of $4,000 every penny will be going towards the shop. It's my main focus and I wont let anything stand in the way of getting it open. If I get more than $4,000 in contributions I'll simply buy more inventory or use the money to help me pay the lease. It's all going into my business account and 100% of it will be used to help me achieve my dream. <br/><br/>I haven't set up any perks yet but I do welcome you to suggest some to me. I'm just not feeling very creative after telling my story. <br/><br/><br/>Feel free to provide feedback and help me make this campaign more effective.<br/></p></div>","With an amazing skate park coming to town it only makes sense to have an awesome shop to match it and I'm the only guy in town for the job.

<p>My name is Jordan Hanson, I'm 28, a trans* woman living in Kansas City, and I'm here to talk to you about trans.report. I started with the idea to build a community site dedicated to amplifying the voices of trans*/gender non-conforming folk who'd like to share their stories. But then I got to thinking -- <b>why stop at building only a digital community?</b></p>
<p>I wonder about the businesses I patronize in Kansas City all the time: Do they have any transgender employees? If so, do they treat them well? What benefits are available to trans* folks in the Kansas City area? If they don't have any transgender employees, why not? Is it a problem of perspective? Are they discriminatory?</p>
<p>These kinds of questions are often difficult to report when it's limited to a single dinner reservation or otherwise. Perhaps because it was a bad experience, perhaps your server was having a bad night -- but in general, <b>people want to do business with businesses that share their values and ideas</b>.</p>
<p>While all of our efforts start here in Kansas City, consider what can happen with some time, attention, and the ability to expand further. Transgender/gender non-conforming folks deserve the opportunity to research businesses and things with the openness and transparency that the might look up a restaurant or research any other experience. Beyond functioning as a news site with commentary and stories, my goal has always been to find a functional way to give back to my community.</p>

<p>In order to get everything in motion, these are the <b>costs we're currently facing:</b></p>
<p><b>1. Getting registered. (Estimated Cost: $50) </b>Part of your donation will go toward registering trans.report as a non-profit entity in Missouri. </p>
<p><b>2. Reserving exhibit space at KC Pride 2016. (Estimated Cost: $325)</b> Another part of your donation will pay for the booth registration costs, electricity, and admission for our workers at the booth (KC pride fees listed <a href=""http://www.gaypridekc.org/exhibitor-food-vendor-and-sponsor-info/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>). These costs go towards registration ($50), nonprofit exhibit space ($200), and electrical service ($75).</p>
<p><b>3. Web hosting. (Estimated Cost: ~$200)</b> While our website is up and running (<a href=""http://www.trans.report"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.trans.report</a>), it costs more to pay someone else to host our domain/contact email than if we ran everything ourselves. We have some of the pieces already, but in order to get everything up and running we'll need to order the rest of the server bits.</p>
<p><b>4. Merchandise/Collateral. (Estimated Cost: $425+)</b> Signs! Banners! Shirts! Stickers! Glitter-speckled rainbows are a thing at Pride festivals all over the country for a reason. Visibility is the key ingredient to presenting a lasting message. With 90% of the brain's messaging being visual stimulus, we can process more with a good visual representation of who we are and what we want to do. Branded collateral (signs, banners, etc) will allow us to do just that. </p>
<p>The ability to offer some kind of tangible merchandise at our exhibit allows us the opportunity to raise funding for our future efforts while also raising awareness about our goals and ambitions to give back to the transgender/gender non-conforming communities.</p>
<p>Ideally, we'd like to offer a range of products, including t-shirts, magnets, stickers -- the sky's the limit, really. The only thing that holds us back is funding. Exactly what we'll be able to offer, however, depends on the success of our fundraising.</p>

<p>As anyone coming out in the transgender community can tell you, locating trans-friendly local resources is a challenge many face. These resources exist, but they're often scattered and disorganized; this leaves many in our community feeling like they have very few paths forward for support, or left to trust the anecdotal evidence of people they might randomly meet online. I think we can do better. <a href=""http://www.thetaskforce.org/static_html/downloads/reports/reports/ntds_report_on_health.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Consider</a>:</p>

I started with the idea to build a community site dedicated to amplifying the voices of trans*/gender non-conforming folk who'd like to share their stories. But then I got to thinking -- why stop at building only a digital community?
I wonder about the businesses I patronize in Kansas City all the time: Do they have any transgender employees? If so, do they treat them well? What benefits are available to trans* folks in the Kansas City area? If they don't have any transgender employees, why not? Is it a problem of perspective? Are they discriminatory?
These kinds of questions are often difficult to report when it's limited to a single dinner reservation or otherwise. Perhaps because it was a bad experience, perhaps your server was having a bad night -- but in general, people want to do business with businesses that share their values and ideas.
While all of our efforts start here in Kansas City, consider what can happen with some time, attention, and the ability to expand further. Transgender/gender non-conforming folks deserve the opportunity to research businesses and things with the openness and transparency that the might look up a restaurant or research any other experience. Beyond functioning as a news site with commentary and stories, my goal has always been to find a functional way to give back to my community.
   

In order to get everything in motion, these are the costs we're currently facing:
1. Getting registered. (Estimated Cost: $50) Part of your donation will go toward registering trans.report as a non-profit entity in Missouri. 
2. Reserving exhibit space at KC Pride 2016. (Estimated Cost: $325) Another part of your donation will pay for the booth registration costs, electricity, and admission for our workers at the booth (KC pride fees listed here). These costs go towards registration ($50), nonprofit exhibit space ($200), and electrical service ($75).
3. Web hosting. (Estimated Cost: ~$200) While our website is up and running (www.trans.report), it costs more to pay someone else to host our domain/contact email than if we ran everything ourselves. We have some of the pieces already, but in order to get everything up and running we'll need to order the rest of the server bits.
4. Merchandise/Collateral. (Estimated Cost: $425+) Signs! Banners! Shirts! Stickers! Glitter-speckled rainbows are a thing at Pride festivals all over the country for a reason. Visibility is the key ingredient to presenting a lasting message. With 90% of the brain's messaging being visual stimulus, we can process more with a good visual representation of who we are and what we want to do. Branded collateral (signs, banners, etc) will allow us to do just that. 
The ability to offer some kind of tangible merchandise at our exhibit allows us the opportunity to raise funding for our future efforts while also raising awareness about our goals and ambitions to give back to the transgender/gender non-conforming communities.
Ideally, we'd like to offer a range of products, including t-shirts, magnets, stickers -- the sky's the limit, really. The only thing that holds us back is funding. Exactly what we'll be able to offer, however, depends on the success of our fundraising.




Every donation will be credited on a thank-you page at our website, as well as featured at KC Pride. Know someone in the transgender/gender non-conforming community? Make a donation in their honor, if you'd prefer.
For donations $25 and above, we'll highlight your contribution on our social media accounts in addition to featuring your name in the 'Thank You' page at our website. Know someone in the transgender/gender non-conforming community? Make your donation in their honor!
For donations $50 or above, we'll also send you a copy of our t-shirt, created just for trans.report at KC Pride 2016. Not in Kansas City? We'll ship it to you, no problem.
Check out the shirt design!




For donations of $150 or above, we'll meet with you in person and do a feature piece on the website to highlight our donors for their generous contribution towards a happier, safer, friendlier Kansas City for the transgender/gender non-conforming community. You'll also get all the other perks as listed above.

    

As anyone coming out in the transgender community can tell you, locating trans-friendly local resources is a challenge many face. These resources exist, but they're often scattered and disorganized; this leaves many in our community feeling like they have very few paths forward for support, or left to trust the anecdotal evidence of people they might randomly meet online. I think we can do better. Consider:



28% of transgender individuals report harassment when accessing health resources.


19% of transgender individuals report being refused care based on their gender identity.


50% of transgender individuals report having to teach their providers how to provide them with adequate care


Your donation can help save lives. Scientific research demonstrates that having access to life-affirming care and support dramatically increases the overall health and wellbeing of transgender/gender non-confirming individuals.

    

I am blessed with a very skilled network of trans* positive individuals in the Kansas City community to whom I'll look for guidance, expertise, and advice in making sure we are able to accomplish our goals in a timely manner.

I'll be honest -- I've never run a nonprofit before. This is intimidating, but I'm not afraid of learning new skills and tricks to make this venture a success. I'm also personally vested in the success of this initiative, because I remember how alienating it felt to scrape around for resources on the internet on my own. 
    

Can't donate? Your help will still contribute to our success:
Share this page and our website (www.trans.report) to help us get the word out!
Remember, this campaign is first -- and foremost -- focused on raising awareness and increasing the visibility of the local transgender/gender non-conforming community.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

Good Grounds Coffee Co buys cherries from farmers and processes them into specialty coffee to sell in North America, creating stable income for farmers who used to fight in rebel groups and armies.
Each container we process provides $36,000 of income to farmers, and each dollar you contribute will be reinvested and multiplied - creating profit and income for Congolese men and women who have chosen peace, year after year.




Our mission: to transform the lives of former Congolese rebels by giving them the option to lay down their guns and grow coffee


your love for coffee + social enterprise = peace in Congo

Impact: without this income, many coffee farmers who have given up their guns to grow coffee will struggle to provide for their families.

Who is Good Grounds?


Good Grounds is a for-profit company that partners with existing cooperatives by financing, marketing and exporting specialty coffee in East Africa. Good Grounds is based in Rwanda, with operations in Eastern DRC (Congo) and North America. Our team consists of two Americans, a Brit and a Canadian with extensive business experience on the ground in East Africa.  

What are we trying to do?
Our vision is to transform the lives of former Congolese rebels by giving them the option to lay down their guns. In Congo employment is scarce, so men join rebel groups to provide for their families. Good Grounds brings lasting change in both the short and long run by providing cooperatives with cash to process cherries and export beans to roasters and consumers in North America. We also guarantee the purchase of all the coffee we pre-finance, eliminating risk for smallholder farmers. 
What is the risk? 

To ensure that we bear the most risk, Good Grounds is personally pre-financing the first container of coffee from Idjwi Island. However, in the interest of long-term sustainability, we’re looking to raise the pre-financing of our second container of coffee through this Indiegogo campaign.

<h3>Résumé du Projet</h3>
<p>Le <b>PROJET FELIX</b> est un organisme
communautaire à but non lucratif qui offre des services à des jeunes adultes
présentant des limitations fonctionnelles d'origine diverses (incapacités
intellectuelles, trouble du spectre de l'autisme ou autres
particularités). </p>
<p>Tout au long de l'année, nous effectuerons de
bonnes actions afin d'aider notre communauté. En août 2017, nous aimerions
effectuer un échange culturel en vue de pratiquer ces mêmes actions dans un
pays étranger. Il s'agit d'une expérience enrichissante que certains
participants du Projet Félix auraient la chance de vivre.</p>
<p>Nous aimerions briser les préjugés actuels en
lien avec ce type de clientèle en mettant de l'avant leurs nombreuses capacités
et habiletés. Les 18 membres du Projet Félix ont  des objectifs à
accomplir et souhaitent particulièrement réaliser un grand rêve. Nous
souhaitons prouver à la population que les difficultés vécues par cette
clientèle ne limitent pas l'accomplissement de ce projet. </p>
<p><b>Notre
objectif</b></p>
<p>Tous les mois,
nous travaillerons afin d'accomplir de bonnes actions auprès
d'un public cible. De plus,  nous réaliserons une
vidéo expliquant tout le processus. Ces vidéos seront publiées sur la
chaîne Youtube de Florennce99 qui est d'ailleurs,  éducatrice au sein
du Projet Félix : <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/florennce99"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>https://www.youtube.com/florennce99</u></a>
.</p>
<p>Pour réaliser ces bonnes actions, nous
souhaitons nous associer à des entreprises afin de recevoir des
dons en échange d'une visibilité positive sur notre chaîne Youtube ainsi que
sur notre page Facebook. </p>
<p>Nous avons décidé de créer une levée de
fonds afin d'inciter les gens à donner pour notre cause. Ce serait un
honneur pour nous d'avoir le support de tous pour ce projet qui nous
tient grandement à coeur . </p>
<h3>Répercussions
souhaitées</h3>
<p>Ce type de projet présente énormément de
répercussions positives ! Tout d'abord,  passer une semaine dans un
pays étranger, aiderait les participants à développer leur autonomie ainsi
que leur ouverture sur le monde.  Ils vivraient notamment, une
expérience enrichissante auprès d’une équipe à laquelle ils développent un
sentiment d’appartenance. Il s’agit ici de réaliser un rêve pour eux également.</p>
<p>Du point de vue de la société, nous souhaitons,
tel que mentionné précédemment, briser les stéréotypes, les préjugés auxquels
cette clientèle fait face tous les jours. Nous désirons mettre de l’avant leurs
forces, leurs qualités et leur joie de vivre. </p>
<p><b>Risques
&amp; Difficultés</b></p>
<p>S’exposer sur les médias sociaux comporte
toujours sa part de risques . Toutefois, nous visons à projeter une image
positive teintée d’acceptation de soi et des autres. </p>
<p>Le projet Félix nécessite près de 35 000$ pour sa
réalisation. Nous voulons réussir à amasser cette somme en vue de récompenser

We all grew up around communities saturated with Bodabodas (Motorcycle Taxis) a renown mode of public transport in East Africa. We want to apply our combined Bodaboda and business experience on Billboda.</p><p><strong>The Need</strong></p><p>Uganda has over 300,000 motorcycle taxis known as Bodabodas. One third of them are in Kampala- the capital. Statistically, this is the most common mode of public transport. These bodabodas are known to be unsafe. Often, riders lack safety gear and have a reputation of being rowdy on the streets. Amy Follan, a writer with the guardian in 2013 wrote an article referring to them as ""silent killers""<a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/aug/13/uganda-motorbike-deaths-road-safety-boda-bodas"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/aug/13/uganda-motorbike-deaths-road-safety-boda-bodas</a> . This and other articles tell us what we in Kampala already know: the bodaboda industry is unregulated and most often, drivers lack minimal safety requirements to be on the road.</p><p>To some, this is a great problem but for us it is a great opportunity as no business model has tapped into the potential of a huge fleet of these bodabodas out there every day.</p><p>We also know that in 2014, a survey of 20 medium and large companies in Uganda show that they spent over $180,000,000 in advertising. Billboards, TV and print medias were the main platforms that were used. This was published by IPSOS an international research organization,<a href=""http://mobile.monitor.co.ug/Business/Business/struggle-control-markets/2471012-2632740-format-xhtml-2pu6hi/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://mobile.monitor.co.ug/Business/Business/struggle-control-markets/2471012-2632740-format-xhtml-2pu6hi/index.html</a>.  </p><p>What if some of this money was leveraged to make the streets of Kampala and Uganda safer for all!</p><p><strong>Our Solution</strong></p><p>Billboda is a bodaboda-based advertising and motorcycle safety training provider that will radically help local businesses get their brand on the streets while making traffic safer for everyone.</p><p>Our goal is to mobilize and organize drivers in the capital first, train them in road safety and ensure that they get a riding license. This is aimed at giving them proper driving skills and improving their road etiquette.</p><p>We will thereafter equip each rider with safety gear such as a reflector jacket and two helmets, one for the driver and the other for the passenger. This will help to curb the increased traffic deaths and casualties that arise due to lack of safety gear.</p><p>Uganda's Bodaboda drivers are also known to be low income earners. We have innovated a way of fitting a Billboda (from Billboard) onto the motorcycle. This will help drivers to make extra money from providing advertising services.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508231417/es2pov1ssxyq7bjzhhiu.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Given the mobility of the Bodabodas, Billboda will be taking company brands even to the remotest places where other modes of advertising fail to reach.</p><p>This we know will be successful because many small and medium businesses are starting up and many other want their brand to be known. This is affirmed by the 2015/6 statistics from Approved Index which showed Uganda as the most entrepreneurial country in the world.</p><p>Billboda is already in the process of forming advertising contracts with local and multinational businesses. Signage will then be applied to bodabodas and driven in targeted areas shown to be of demographic interest.</p><p><strong>Fund</strong></p><p>We need your help to raise $45,000 to get our business off the ground with 250 initial Billbodas.</p><p><strong>Our Perks</strong></p><ol>

</ol><p><strong>Impact</strong></p><p>Every day, the National Referral Hospital, located in the capital, alone receives 50 to 60 bodaboda accident victims, according to Dr. Muhumuza in Mulago. Many of the patients are treated for life-threatening injuries that require extensive surgeries and hospital stays that last for many months. These surgeries and stays, while necessary to preserve life, are expensive. Accident victims often resort to taking out loans to pay their hospital bills.</p><p>Worse for drivers, because driving bodabodas are their primary source of income, victims do have to find means to pay back the loans while they recover from their injuries. Some never recover enough to be able to drive again. Not only are individual victims suffering from crippling medical debt, the Department of Health spends over $700,000 each year for their care. This financial burden is passed on to the public.<br/>Billboda has worked to help solve this problem through partnering with local businesses to provide driver’s training and safety gear. Professional driver’s training gives bodaboda operators the cognitive and technical skills to avoid accidents in the first place. This improves traffic for everyone. Despite efforts that significantly reduce the occurrence of accidents, some accidents are not 100% avoidable. In these cases, wearable safety gear such as helmets, gloves, and armored safety clothing, reduce impact on the body and protect drivers against debilitating injuries.<br/>Furthermore, our unique advertising partnership with local businesses, who pay to have their logos and advertisements on the gear and on the bodabodas, essentially pay bodaboda drivers to be safe while building revenue for drivers and for the business owners. The result is one that benefits the community as a whole on many levels: Accidents and injuries are reduced, traffic improves, the financial burden on individuals and the Department of Health is relieved, business owners get their brand on the streets, and bodaboda drivers earn extra income.</p><p>We have also identified a metal workshop to carry out our fabrication work for the Billbodas. This workshop has a continuous opportunity to do business with us. We believe that we will be improving their revenue stream significantly. This is important to us because this workshop has a goal of skilling youths especially the disadvantaged ones to enhance the socio-economic wellbeing.</p><p><strong>Our Risks</strong></p><p>As businesses and the community see the positive difference Billboda makes on the community as a whole, it is very important that we not only set a standard of responsibility and safety, but to maintain it.<br/><br/>One of the risks Billboda must assume is that not all drivers will be compliant with their training and with maintaining their branded safety gear. To reduce the negative impact of having to assume costs from damaged or lost gear, we are working towards partnering with insurance companies to provide coverage at a fair rate to defray cost for replacing gear that has been damaged or stolen, as well as to help protect business owners utilizing our service from financial liability.<br/><br/>Secondly, in order to maintain Billbodas commitment to safety, we must have in place a system by which to withdraw incentives from drivers who are not consistent in following our contractual code of conduct.

</ol></div>","IntroductionBillboda Ads is a start-up that uses the hundreds of thousands of motorcycle taxis in Uganda (bodabodas) to advertise, creating eye-catching ad opportunities to local and multinational businesses, while also creating a new stream of income for the bodaboda drivers.We are a team of four Ugandans who met at college at African Business Institute. We all grew up around communities saturated with Bodabodas (Motorcycle Taxis) a renown mode of public transport in East Africa. We want to apply our combined Bodaboda and business experience on Billboda.The NeedUganda has over 300,000 motorcycle taxis known as Bodabodas. One third of them are in Kampala- the capital. Statistically, this is the most common mode of public transport. These bodabodas are known to be unsafe. Often, riders lack safety gear and have a reputation of being rowdy on the streets. Amy Follan, a writer with the guardian in 2013 wrote an article referring to them as ""silent killers""https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/aug/13/uganda-motorbike-deaths-road-safety-boda-bodas . This and other articles tell us what we in Kampala already know: the bodaboda industry is unregulated and most often, drivers lack minimal safety requirements to be on the road.To some, this is a great problem but for us it is a great opportunity as no business model has tapped into the potential of a huge fleet of these bodabodas out there every day.We also know that in 2014, a survey of 20 medium and large companies in Uganda show that they spent over $180,000,000 in advertising. Billboards, TV and print medias were the main platforms that were used. This was published by IPSOS an international research organization,http://mobile.monitor.co.ug/Business/Business/struggle-control-markets/2471012-2632740-format-xhtml-2pu6hi/index.html.  What if some of this money was leveraged to make the streets of Kampala and Uganda safer for all!Our SolutionBillboda is a bodaboda-based advertising and motorcycle safety training provider that will radically help local businesses get their brand on the streets while making traffic safer for everyone.Our goal is to mobilize and organize drivers in the capital first, train them in road safety and ensure that they get a riding license. This is aimed at giving them proper driving skills and improving their road etiquette.We will thereafter equip each rider with safety gear such as a reflector jacket and two helmets, one for the driver and the other for the passenger. This will help to curb the increased traffic deaths and casualties that arise due to lack of safety gear.Uganda's Bodaboda drivers are also known to be low income earners. We have innovated a way of fitting a Billboda (from Billboard) onto the motorcycle. This will help drivers to make extra money from providing advertising services.Given the mobility of the Bodabodas, Billboda will be taking company brands even to the remotest places where other modes of advertising fail to reach.This we know will be successful because many small and medium businesses are starting up and many other want their brand to be known. This is affirmed by the 2015/6 statistics from Approved Index which showed Uganda as the most entrepreneurial country in the world.Billboda is already in the process of forming advertising contracts with local and multinational businesses. Signage will then be applied to bodabodas and driven in targeted areas shown to be of demographic interest.FundWe need your help to raise $45,000 to get our business off the ground with 250 initial Billbodas.Our Perks

<p>The question comes up - why a cat cafe?  If someone wants to be with a cat, they'll get one.  Not so fast!  As much as people would like to have their very own cat, they often don't.  Their lives are busy.  They're not home enough to have a cat in residence.  BUT!!! People still want to cuddle with a kitty - in a non-committal way.  How about just going to the shelter to visit kitties there - maybe even volunteer?  Well, that's a great idea, but for many people it makes them so sad.  You can volunteer at the shelter but you can also make yourself feel good. It's OK to take care of you.</p>
<p>We can fix that!  Feline Good Social Club looks like a family den - but with adoptable cats.  Voila!!! You can visit and cuddle and play with our kitties as often as you want with no pressure to do any more.  You don't have to be sad and the kitties are happy and relaxed in their big room with all the comforts.  Don't get nervous.  There's still no commitment - UNLESS, you want one!  All of the kitties will be up for adoption.  It's your decision when you're ready for a decision.  Take your time.</p>
<p>Now, you might ask if it's really all that good for the cats - and Gilbey will tell you about that:</p>

<p>""This is me at an adoption event in a crate in a noisy strange place.  If I wasn't here, I would be at Feline Good Social Club where I would feel safe and comfortable.  People could get to see my real personality - it's a doozy.  Plus, when I get adopted my peeps here will go back to the rescue group and get more kitties and that makes more room at the rescue for homeless kitties like I was.  I was lucky and found my forever home, but some cats are so upset at adoption events that it takes them a really long time to catch that forever home.""</p>
<p>An important question to answer for any contributor is what will the funds be used for.</p>
<p>Of course, any business that wants to attract people to come and stay a while will require a design to create that ambiance.  We want your experience in the Cat Lounge to be a memorable one.  It needs to be comfortable for the humans and the cats at the same time.  We believe we've created just that perfect balance and you'll love it.  This is where the contributions we receive from you will be spent.  The build out includes permitting, licensing, plans, and construction to comply with the City regulations.  We want Feline Good Social Club to be the best possible experience for everyone.</p>

Now, you might ask if it's really all that good for the cats - and Gilbey will tell you about that:

""This is me at an adoption event in a crate in a noisy strange place.  If I wasn't here, I would be at Feline Good Social Club where I would feel safe and comfortable.  People could get to see my real personality - it's a doozy.  Plus, when I get adopted my peeps here will go back to the rescue group and get more kitties and that makes more room at the rescue for homeless kitties like I was.  I was lucky and found my forever home, but some cats are so upset at adoption events that it takes them a really long time to catch that forever home.""
An important question to answer for any contributor is what will the funds be used for.
Of course, any business that wants to attract people to come and stay a while will require a design to create that ambiance.  We want your experience in the Cat Lounge to be a memorable one.  It needs to be comfortable for the humans and the cats at the same time.  We believe we've created just that perfect balance and you'll love it.  This is where the contributions we receive from you will be spent.  The build out includes permitting, licensing, plans, and construction to comply with the City regulations.  We want Feline Good Social Club to be the best possible experience for everyone.

 

It's pretty fabulous isn't it?!!!
We know that we can't do this alone.  Even though we are self-funding a fair portion of these costs, your contributions will help get us the rest of the way.
PSSSST - don't forget about all of the new cats you'll get to meet and hang out with!

We know that not everyone can afford to make an investment in a large way, but everyone can do something.  You can help us to get the word out about this campaign!  Make some noise!  Share the news far and wide in every way you can.  Indiegogo also has share tools to help you do this.

The bottom line is that every moment we are open, we will be working to save the lives of beautiful but homeless companion cats - and providing people with a respite from their busy stressful lives by relaxing in the company of cats - like these 3 kitties - Beamer, Opie and TuTee.

</div><ul> <li>I am starting this to raise money to get me started with the cars I need to start my business. It is a traveling rental car business, but not your typical traveling or rental car. I will be taking folks like me and folks that just want to drive a modified sports car on a traveling experience like you've never experienced before through the rocky mountains! We will travel in groups together and stop and see all the beauty that Colorado has to offer on a 3 day 2 night adventure for one of my packages. While also driving on some of the funnest and challenging roads there are all through the Rockies. </li>

<li>So with my knowledge and back round of cars I don't need to buy new cars but rather I can get myself cars with higher mileage for cheap while still retaining attractive and eye catching cars and repair them myself. I have a budget of $6500 per car now that is a maximum to buy and recondition each car. </li>

Hi my name is Andrew, I am a car enthusiast and a well rounded mechanic. I have always wanted to have a career around cars although after starting a family my passion and hobby was put on pause to take up a more practical career. I took up a career in digital media and digital printing and I am very comfortable and have a good job but I have always wanted to start a business since I was a kid and really want it to involve CARS. ""Liking what you have is not a good enough reason to not want something better""
 I am starting this to raise money to get me started with the cars I need to start my business. It is a traveling rental car business, but not your typical traveling or rental car. I will be taking folks like me and folks that just want to drive a modified sports car on a traveling experience like you've never experienced before through the rocky mountains! We will travel in groups together and stop and see all the beauty that Colorado has to offer on a 3 day 2 night adventure for one of my packages. While also driving on some of the funnest and challenging roads there are all through the Rockies. 
There will also be track days, and I will offer a 1 day drives to some of the closest and best winding roads near Denver and after we can stop by a brewery or local restaurant and dinner is on me!


   What We Need & What You Get Breaking it down!  I am asking for $30,000! Whoa! That's a lot but I am going to be starting with 5 cars and expand and grow from there with my middle goal being to double that to 10 cars and end goal of 25 different cars in my ""fleet"" but cars are not cheap things to acquire but I can get them cheaper and fix them better than the average Joe to cut back on costs.
So with my knowledge and back round of cars I don't need to buy new cars but rather I can get myself cars with higher mileage for cheap while still retaining attractive and eye catching cars and repair them myself. I have a budget of $6500 per car now that is a maximum to buy and recondition each car. 
A huge PLUS about this is I will have no overhead to start and don't need any employees besides myself and asking friends for some huge favors to help me fix the cars quickly to get the business rolling. 


    Impacting Wildlife and National Parks So the impact of this whole thing will be awareness to the wildlife and national parks conservation. I will be donating a percent of proceeds from my trips to the national parks around Colorado to help conserve and maintain the true natural beauty of our wonderful state.
 I also have a sickening work ethic. Since my best friend when I was younger pushed me to be better than I was I stopped feeling sorry for myself and began to become a hard working member of society. I am not one of the people to complain that something is too hard, I am the one when faced with more work rather then complain I go beast mode and work HARDER no pain no gain. That's what it's all about..believe in yourself and others will believe in you too.



    Risks So in this day and age that we all live in and especially in my booming state of Colorado everything is going up in cost. So if I can get my funding together I plan on devoting all of my time and  attention to detail and hard work into this business.  So that is very unnerving when having a family is going in 100% and hoping that I will succeed. But I will have to rely on myself and myself is someone I can gamble on. 
I am no stranger as I am sure very few are to social media to spread the word. I am already putting together a web page and will be using tools to get me advertised to the correct people through the internet as well as sales on the streets offering deals and incentives to fill up the cars every week. I will never stop working my tail off until I grow the business into what I want it to be and even then I have a ton more entrepreneurial ideas for when I have capitol to invest into other projects and I promise I will ALWAYS come back here to indiegogo and help people like me who just need someone to believe in them.


    Other Ways You Can Help Now if you break down the math I need 1200 people to make small donations and I will be at my goal in no time!   But if you guys out there took the time to watch my video and read about me and can't help me out with $$ that is okay I appreciate the time you spent with me!! But if you can share this to your social media and get me out there for hopefully more folks to see that is just as valuable!!  There are Indiegogo share tools to use as well!

We have taken the area on a typical residential lot and structured it to provide fresh organic produce through the use of edible landscaping. Printed information and viral documentation of this project is accessible to individuals worldwide to assist in educating them about the benefits of  becoming less dependent upon commercialized farming for sustenance. Our project consists of four phases, with its final goal being to provide free, locally grown produce to the working poor. Phase I included purchasing the 12,828 sq feet of land, testing the soil, and finally getting all of the insurance and permitting. Done! Phase II comprised of excavating the land and building the infrastructure. Done! We are currently working on Phase III, the subsistence agriculture. Our fencing, trellising, and irrigation system have all been successfully installed. Thus far, we have planted nineteen fruit bearing trees; eight grape vines, and thirty-three berry bushes. We built eleven grow beds, six of which are filled with vegetables such as lettuce, spinach, beets, carrots and herbs. Best of all, we have grown all of these items in the absence of harmful herbicides and pesticides! To enable <strong>Earthen Haven</strong> to be as productive as possible, we have also purchased two brood boxes and a Flow Hive with bees to increase pollination; five beautiful Silkie chickens to provide eggs and natural fertilizer, and our composting bin and worms to recycle our organics and in turn, amend our soil. Now, our family has decided we need to branch out to other humanitarians to bring <strong>Earthen Haven</strong> to fruition by asking you to help us complete our third phase so we may begin the fourth phase of giving!</p><h3>The Need</h3><p>Lower income families often feel constrained by false perceptions about the cost of eating healthy fresh fruits and vegetables. The astounding number of homes with hard working individuals who still fall below the poverty line is heart breaking. These families should have access to fresh produce every day.

Is this really a big deal when the qualitative loss in caloric and nutritional value of that retail food is shockingly insubstantial anyhow? YES!

<p>My name is Addison, and I am a homebrewer of 5 1/2 years. It all started with a 1 gallon kit my wife bought me on Christmas, and it has exploded from there. I have been doing all grain 5 gallon batches for a year. Before that it was extract with specialty grains.</p>
<p>I have built most every part of my homebrew setup, and all of it is 2nd hand. My mash tun is a cooler I found for $1, my hot liquor tank is a cooler I got form my in-laws for Christmas, my kettle and burner from a fellow brewer, and my most proud accomplishment is my brew stand I built out of pallets. It's not the prettiest set up, but by god it works!</p>
<p>What I am asking of you is to help me upgrade my equipment to become more efficient, more controlled and more reliable. I aspire to be a brewery owner one day in the not to distant future. Ask any brewer and they will tell you that the industry is ever evolving with lots of learning to be had. Friends, family, strangers and beer judges all like my beers, but there is room for improvement. I am my toughest critic, and I see a lot of potential in my beers.</p>
<p>To get down to it, the money raised will go to temperature controlled fermentation (my biggest issue), bigger brew kettle, counter flow wort chiller (my biggest waste of time and water), kegs and other bits and pieces.</p>
<p>While I currently have no rewards to offer, other than my scencerist gratitude, I will happily share pictures and information on my progress. If you are a local, you can even try some of the current homebrew.</p>
<p>I thank you for taking the time out of your busy day to read my proposal.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

What’s more, our data visualization can optimize sales strategies to help manufacturers target the most cost-effective strategies on the market.</p><p>We do this by allowing you to upload your products to our mobile application (for a small monthly fee).

That allows retailers to engage with and understand customers to sell more goods; all this while providing convenience for consumers and jobs for locals. Reasons to Invest
Small businesses deserve to have their products distributed and displayed without paying OUTRAGEOUS slotting fees.
The market for beauty, hygiene, and cleaning prdoucts continues to grow each year, and so does the demand for on-demand delivery.
Our goal is to become the largest distribution platform for small local businesses by scaling out our existing software through partnerships and acquisitions.
  “The one profiting off of your brands should be you""  80% to 90% of new products fail. Placing an untested product puts retailers at immense financial risk — slotting fees arose to mitigate sales losses. Slotting allowances became common in the 1980s, when new products were proliferating across the marketplace, and have remained a standard practice among retailers.For many vendors, slotting fees are just a price of doing business.The good news is that BeauDASH is the solution. At BeauDASH , we help businesses generate the most effective sales and reduce these costs. We empower businesses to get distribution and understand the value of their own products and participate in the resulting profit. What’s more, our data visualization can optimize sales strategies to help manufacturers target the most cost-effective strategies on the market.We do this by allowing you to upload your products to our mobile application (for a small monthly fee). We then curate a strategic marketing campaigns to help promote our partnership and your products. Lastly, we deliver your goods directly to your consumers in less than an hour for a super small delivery fee (the consumer pays for this). Since launch, we’ve focused on partnering with local business owners in South Florida  like L'amour Maternel & Gawdess Galore. We collected 1K in revenue for our Partners in our first week of operation, but our vision is much larger than than the sunshine state. We want all small businesses globally to have access to our distribution platform for their consumers. While automation and self-service is booming, 3 valuable segments of the retail economy are being left out!BeautyPersonal CareHouse CleaningWhy is it that we can shop for alcohol or a burger and have it delivered in two-hours or less, not toilet paper, cleaning products, or beauty essentials?!We live in a pandemic age where on-demand delivery has become a norm. In other words, the concept, which was in a nascent stage a few years ago, is now in limelight. And why not? People prefer to stay at home and order necessary items to get delivery at their doorstep in this quarantine period. Though movement restrictions and lockdown-like situations are eased gradually across the world, it seems that on-demand delivery is mainstreamed in the retail segment.On-demand delivery is at the heart of a colossal shift in the retail paradigm, and in the midst of this phenomenon deemed “CoVid-19”, the on-demand retail industry is EXPLODING. In fact, a recent reports of retail customers showed that the over 23 million users spend $57.6 billion annually and now prefer on-demand delivery experiences, as per Harvard Business.
Around 7.6 million Americans will act as providers in the on-demand economy by 2020
On-demand food delivery market will reach $161.74 billion by the year 2023
Instacart and Walmart Grocery have recorded a surge of 218% and 160% in the number of daily downloads in this corona age
  We deliver beauty, house cleaning, and personal care products from small businesses established in your local community, including major retailers you love, in under 1-hour.BeauDASH has created a distribution platform that flips the script and allows small businesses (our Partners) to grow exponentially without having to pitch to big box retailers or leave the comfort of their homes. We put the power back in the hands of the creators!By using our applications to sell their own products, our Partners can now get access to a broader market of consumers and marketing, dedicated to driving results. Concurrently, consumers gain access to their favorite products without having to drive to the store or wait in line.  We see ourselves becoming the future of product distribution between small local businesses and their consumers. As the on-demand economy grows, we plan to be there with our proprietary technology as the flagship option from B2C sales transactions.  We charge our Partners a monthly or annual annual subscription for access to our ecosystem. This costs businesses anywhere from $300 to $500 per year and gives growing companies an opportunity to enhance their existing sales, marketing strategies or supplement the very expensive shelving costs currently on availble. We also offer Service Level Agreements in exchange for more platform support from our team.We charge an monthly or annual subscription from our BeauDASH customers to receive access to FREE delivery with BeauDASH Boundless on every order over $12 for only $9.99 a month or $99.99 annually, get and receive FREE delivery.*Pricing disclosed above is subject to change depending on the customer and products outlined in each relationship.

<p>KUTULU BOXES: Curated boxes for unique experiences!</p>
<p>KUTULU is a company that designs curated boxes with different themes that will provide unique individual experiences for curious minds.</p>
<h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619803865/b5q7u3jfgvwiwpbcyifb.jpg"" src=""""/></h2>
<h2>OUR PROJECT</h2>
<h3><strong>Support our dream project KUTULU! </strong></h3>
<p>We are setting up a female-led art business that aims to support interdisciplinary works between arts, crafts, research and entertainment. KUTULU is a company that creates curated boxes for different themes. Each box is designed to provide a unique individual experience for curious minds. The boxes can provide personal as well as shared activities that you can participate with others. Through KUTULU you may learn new things, interact with other KUTULU followers and have a fun day/night curated specifically for you.  You may also participate in our private online events by which you will be supporting local artists, designers and business owners.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How KUTULU was born?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Kutu means box in our mother tongue, kutulu (with a box) is a reference to the Kutulu (Also known as Cthulhu) which is a fictional cosmic entity created by one of our favourite writers H. P. Lovecraft in his 1928 short story ""The Call of Cthulhu"". Kutulu is a hybrid creature with tentacles and dragon-like wings which was very inspirational for our company's hybrid vision. </p>
<p>The pandemic brought so many inconveniences and difficulties to our lives. But one of the things that we are so grateful for, is  that we found ourselves in a house of collaboration and creativity when most needed. We had endless nights where we created games and art projects for each other. We organised house exhibitions, screenings and movie nights, and while we tried to keep each other safe and entertained, we started sharing these ideas with our close friends and we have received incredible feedback. This creative environment helped us deal with the anxieties we had for  we felt our fields in arts &amp; education are becoming less accessible to the public. This awareness helped us become more grounded and productive in creating  our own business idea which would be helpful  for our community as well.</p>
<p>We are not only good friends but we are also excellent collaborators. We worked in related fields for more than eight years, and we are fully trained as researchers, curators and event organisers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Let us introduce you with some of the KUTULU boxes and ideas; </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Nail Art Box: </strong></p>
<p>We were always fascinated with the idea of using body parts as exhibition spaces. A couple of years ago, artist Funa Ye organised an open call for an exhibition in Nottingham where she asked participants to create an exhibition on nails. Since then, we are  thinking about how the nail art community expanded as a beauty trend. We are fascinated by how nail art can be an activity where you can express yourself, your art, your mood and even your dreams by using different mediums. With our nail art box, we are not aiming to give you a final cut manicure, but more of a DIY experience where you can use different materials to create your own art while having a great time with your friends. And yes, nail art is for all ages, all genders! We will support our nail art box with workshops and commissioned designs by incredible nail artists.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619803828/gzrhva6ajb6cla0w8xcr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Cabinet of Curiosity Box:</strong></p>
<p>Cabinets of curiosities, also known as 'wonder rooms', were small collections of extraordinary objects which inspired today’s museums. Historically, they were known to be places where people showcased their personal collections of natural findings, artworks, and curious objects with personal, scientific and mythical stories behind them. As a small replica of this unique collecting practice, which dates back to the 16th century, this box intends to revive similar interests by evoking your inner collector. With this box of wonders, you can be part of the stories that we have already started writing for you or you can also use it as a guide to create your own cabinet of curiosity.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619803943/df8hawp0enatxiuy1539.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Artist' Box:</strong></p>
<p>With the Artists' Box, we aim to introduce individual artists or art collectives by commissioning a box-based limited edition work. This box is just another way for us to show that we can use any platform to create and share art. Think this box as a portable art “space” where especially underrepresented artists could use to share their work. Each box owner will have a private link where they can reach artists' personal stories. Through this link they can also have online studio visits and access detailed information about the artists’ practice and upcoming/ongoing projects. Each year, we hope to work with at least four artists.</p>
<p>*Some of the artists that we are collaborating with have already started preparing their own boxes and we can't wait to share them.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Hex Box: </strong></p>
<p>Hex Box is a very daring box for us! Initially focusing on the traditions of occult sciences, offerings, and charms, this box is curated for you to channel whatever memory, feeling, concern you have into a custom-made doll made by a local artisan, and partake a ritual following the instructions that you will find in the box. </p>
<p>*As an extension to the Hex Box, you will have the chance to reach artists, researchers, and historians who are experts on the subject and will help you to explore the secret sides of occult sciences, practices and stories.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619803991/iaarz9wlkmnvf89qmjxj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Play Box:</strong></p>
<p>Well, we are kinky individuals, but awareness around sex and sex education came into discourse way later in our life; now, thanks to incredibly well connected online communities , this awareness could reach a wider audience. With play box you can experience an exciting erotic night where you can discover the history of sex and pleasure from different cultures and eras. You will have access to uniquely curated games which will offer you either a fun solo night or a kinky group activity ;)  It could also make a thoughtful gift for your loved ones or an open invite for exploration!  </p>
<p>*Each box will have a QR code that will lead you to a private video curated and prepared for you. This extended experience will range from instruction videos to artist studio visits and conversations with experts.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619815869/d5n05wghnwdrerhdqxwp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Our project KUTULU is based on:</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p><strong>Eda</strong>: I am a PhD researcher and a photographer who loves working with different materials, locations, archives and people. I consider the research process as a creative and collaborative experience. With KUTULU, we will not only provide a personal experience but connect people through collaborative projects where we share our research process and create together through online talks, workshops and events. <strong>Mine</strong>: I'm an independent curator and worked in arts for more than seven years; having organised various art events and projects in different countries; I tend to see where accessibility and transdisciplinarity is still an issue in our current system. With KUTULU, we hope to share our personal experiences while supporting artists, artisans and local businesses by promoting and selling their work and products.</p>
<p><strong>Knowledge production &amp; research: </strong>We are library and archive freaks! We love learning from each other, from our communities and sharing them with broader audiences. We treat our boxes as unique art projects that can be experienced collectively as well as privately. With your support, we  hope to continue our research to develop and produce our other box ideas.  </p>
<p><strong>Imagination:</strong> We are not afraid of expressing ourselves or think differently, and being willing to explore new perspectives.</p>
<p><strong>Financial independence:</strong> We aim to raise awareness on inequalities of creative industries, including arts and education. We will, however, need to build our supporting financial structures so that we can help others as well.</p>
<p><strong>Fun: </strong>Humour is a big turn on! So hopefully, KUTULU's core function will be just making people laugh while creating and learning something new!</p>
<p><strong>Resilience:</strong> Staying faithful to our mission and values is essential, but we will have the flexibility to adapt what the future will bring.</p>
<p>At the moment, we have the prototypes and supporting events for our first five boxes. Thanks to your generous help and support, we are hoping to produce the rest of our box ideas, improve our  design and find alternative ecological solutions for our packaging. With your support we will finalise our website and social media accounts where we can start launching our events with artists that will accompany our boxes at the end of this summer. Any support is highly appreciated, and we are so excited to share our journey with you all!</p>

During these financially tough times, the arts & culture industries have been impacted, so we aim to start our own project in East London to help support local artists and small businesses.
Our uniquely selected rewards are chosen to represent our projects. The rewards range from tote bags, selected boxes to  limited edition artworks.
With your kind support and contribution, we will fund and start our own dream company this summer! We are committed to finishing our project. even if we don't reach our target fund in Indiegogo.

 
Our team: 
Mine Kaplangı (1987, Istanbul) is an independent curator and arts writer based in London. She is the co-founder of the curatorial collective Collective Çukurcuma. She is passionate about transdisciplinary art practices and has been working on the idea of how to expand the accessibility of art. She believes that arts should be experienced daily, not only within the walls of institutions. Mine helps artists to develop their archives, publications and public art projects and also works as a freelance editor for the Berlin-based contemporary art platform Artfridge. She is a community builder, a big fan of DIY & zine & nail art culture.
Eda Sancakdar (1985, Samsun) is a London based photographer and researcher. For her photographic practices she collaborates with various queer collectives, performance artists and movers. She is currently a PhD student at the Winchester School of Art, University of Southampton and holds an MFA in Visual Communication and Design. Her academic interests involve 19th century visual history, archive building and memory studies as well as histories of occult practices and their relation to visual arts. Eda herself is a collector and an avid fan of oddities; everything that blurs the lines between the real  and imaginary.
 

Risks & Challenges
As with any dream project, there are risks and challenges that may arise over the course of the launch. We believe that with your generous support we can start our online events in the following weeks and launch our company at the end of this summer but we are aware that any unexpected delays might occur due to Covid-19 restrictions.
Also unexpected delays may occur for shipping our rewards due to Covid-19 but we will keep our international supporters fully updated regarding the situation and they will know well in advance if there is likely to be a delay. 
We can not wait to share KUTULU with you and also continue working on our additional ideas of how to turn this business idea into a sustainable community art project.

<p>Reader’s Legacy is a place where book lovers
can preserve the intimate relationships they have built over the years with
their books. The same books that taught them invaluable lessons, lifted them
out of dark times, transported them to places they could only dream about --
those same books hold deep value, both tangible and sentimental.</p>
<p>We are an online community where people who
love to read can come together -- the world’s largest bookclub, in a sense.</p>
<p>Independent authors will rely upon Reader’s
Legacy to promote their books and make more sales. Reading enthusiasts will
flock to our website for the chance to socialize with other readers and with
their favorite authors, and to build up their Litcoin™ accounts.</p>

<br/><p>Users of ReadersLegacy.com can
create a free account and use our smartphone app to scan the barcodes of every

<p><span>When books get added to your
bookshelf on ReadersLegacy.com, they aren’t the actual books themselves, but
advertorial pages of the books. These pages contain a picture of the book
cover, the author’s name, other works by that author, a trailer video of the
book, and thousands of comments by fellow lovers of that book, who are all
registered users of Reader’s Legacy.</span></p>
<p>With all this information at your fingertips, you would come across a
treasure trove of new book recommendations, either by the same author or
another user saying, “If you love this book, I know you’ll also love ____.”</p>
<p>In turn, you could also add your own notes and help your fellow book lovers

feed that a respected colleague, or maybe even just a friend who you know loves
the same types of books as you, just added a new book to their library. You’ve
never heard of this book but, trusting in this person’s tastes and judgement,
decide to check it out knowing it must be a good read.</p>
<p>You then check out the advertorial page for that book and see all the other
comments people have made about it. Within those comments, you see a comment by
Bill Gates or Oprah that cements your interest. On Reader’s Legacy, you are
naturally brought to the point where you want to buy that book.</p>

<p>Gamification is a powerful tool to build and sustain engagement and
enjoyment with a website. Litcoin™ credits are earned through creating an
account, adding books, engaging in the community, following authors and
publishers, posting comments, sharing comments to other social media networks,

<p>The idea for Reader’s Legacy started in 2011. Behind the work of our 29
full-time staff, we successfully launched the website on June 7, 2015. In the
first 10 days after launch, we had over 1,000 people join the community.</p>
<p>In fact, Cevin Bryenman, Publisher at Publishers Weekly and a go-to
authority in the publishing industry, called us, “one of the fastest growing
publishing companies in the U.S.” and Bryerman said, ""ReadersLegacy.com is
like adding gas to an already raging fire"".</p>
<p><strong>Infrastructure</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://ReadersLegacy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://ReadersLegacy.com</a> is built on the Python platform. Our partnership
with Ingram Content, the largest distributor in the world, gives us an embedded
API where all our data is housed -- this is the same setup that Amazon has with
Ingram for data feed and distribution.   </p>
<p><b>As many books as Amazon, better pricing then Amazon &amp; you get points!</b></p>
<p>From the day we launched, on June 7th, we have been selling over 15,000,000 books.  On October 1st, 2015, we will be launching the ability for independent authors to load their books, and set their own retail price.  When a book sells, the independent author will ship the book and we will pay them the revenue.  For the reading enthusiast, this means a facebook like experience with better service, pricing and perks then Amazon.</p>

A Virtual Home Library


Reader’s Legacy is a place where book lovers
can preserve the intimate relationships they have built over the years with
their books. The same books that taught them invaluable lessons, lifted them
out of dark times, transported them to places they could only dream about --
those same books hold deep value, both tangible and sentimental.
We are an online community where people who
love to read can come together -- the world’s largest bookclub, in a sense.
Independent authors will rely upon Reader’s
Legacy to promote their books and make more sales. Reading enthusiasts will
flock to our website for the chance to socialize with other readers and with
their favorite authors, and to build up their Litcoin™ accounts.
All users love the familiarity of
ReadersLegacy.com. We are built using the same technology as both Amazon and
Facebook, creating an enjoyable experience discussing and discovering books on
https://ReadersLegacy.com.
Our founder, Ken Dunn, recounts how it all started!



The team at Reader's Legacy are all authors and avid readers.  We have created the ultimate experience for those people who truly love books and those who write them.  The entire world of books is in the middle of the largest change in history - virtualization.  For many, the change has not been easy, for others it presents opportunity!
Now you can create a free account, build a virtual version of your home library and the books you love, connect with readers around the world and earn Litcoins to use on your next book purchase.  Here are some more details on what is waiting for you:
(after this, we will introduce you to our team and tell you how you can help)





Users of ReadersLegacy.com can
create a free account and use our smartphone app to scan the barcodes of every
book you’ve ever read. Those books then show up in your virtual bookshelf,
preserving your legacy. We also built in a search feature on the website
to find books and add them to your collection.



When books get added to your
bookshelf on ReadersLegacy.com, they aren’t the actual books themselves, but
advertorial pages of the books. These pages contain a picture of the book
cover, the author’s name, other works by that author, a trailer video of the
book, and thousands of comments by fellow lovers of that book, who are all
registered users of Reader’s Legacy.
With all this information at your fingertips, you would come across a
treasure trove of new book recommendations, either by the same author or
another user saying, “If you love this book, I know you’ll also love ____.”
In turn, you could also add your own notes and help your fellow book lovers
find new books, or even make sense of a specific passage or chapter in that
book.

As part of the world’s largest book
club, a mashup of Facebook, Amazon, GoodReads and Lulu, users also have the
ability to follow their favorite authors, publishers, and of course, their
friends and colleagues.
So, for example, you could be on Reader’s Legacy one day and see in your
feed that a respected colleague, or maybe even just a friend who you know loves
the same types of books as you, just added a new book to their library. You’ve
never heard of this book but, trusting in this person’s tastes and judgement,
decide to check it out knowing it must be a good read.
You then check out the advertorial page for that book and see all the other
comments people have made about it. Within those comments, you see a comment by
Bill Gates or Oprah that cements your interest. On Reader’s Legacy, you are
naturally brought to the point where you want to buy that book.

Litcoin™ credits are our own
virtual currency on ReadersLegacy.com. We created them to help you take your
virtual bookshelf to the next level. What good is having a bookshelf unless you
can keep adding to it after all?
Gamification is a powerful tool to build and sustain engagement and
enjoyment with a website. Litcoin™ credits are earned through creating an
account, adding books, engaging in the community, following authors and
publishers, posting comments, sharing comments to other social media networks,
etc.
Litcoin™ credits are easy to earn and make it so you may never have to buy
another book again. The more you
participate in this fun and social book club, the cheaper your new books
become.

On Reader’s Legacy, independent
authors -- all 50 million of them by some accounts -- can create an account for
them and for their book, fill in all the metadata, and start selling their book
straight from the website. By being part of this community, you also have the
rare opportunity to connect with your potential readers on a personal level.
You are simply book-loving peers on Reader’s Legacy. You can appeal to your
readers’ interests because you know them on a deeper level.

Additionally, the big players in self-publishing are all huge companies who
don’t care about the success of your book. Reader’s Legacy is different because
we take an active interest in helping you market and sell your life’s work. We help make your legacy, and your reader’s legacy,
one in the same.

Publishers now have an easy way to
contact authors, market their packages, and keep in touch with future or
potential readers. They can also create a complete list of all the authors they
have published, allowing them to collect a fan base. A user will be naturally
inclined to a publisher they see is responsible for all their favorite authors.
How many publishers can say they have fans? This will, in turn, inspire other
authors to use you as their publisher in the future.(Every single person who contributes, with a minimum contribution of 
$10, to our campaign will be entered into a random drawing for the 
following prizes:Grand Prize:  Trip for 2 to Las Vegas  for the 
2nd annual RCLA, June 4-6 2016 (flights in continental USA, Hotel for 3

The Official Launch of Reader's Legacy








The idea for Reader’s Legacy started in 2011. Behind the work of our 29
full-time staff, we successfully launched the website on June 7, 2015. In the
first 10 days after launch, we had over 1,000 people join the community.
In fact, Cevin Bryenman, Publisher at Publishers Weekly and a go-to
authority in the publishing industry, called us, “one of the fastest growing
publishing companies in the U.S.” and Bryerman said, ""ReadersLegacy.com is
like adding gas to an already raging fire"".
Infrastructure
https://ReadersLegacy.com is built on the Python platform. Our partnership
with Ingram Content, the largest distributor in the world, gives us an embedded
API where all our data is housed -- this is the same setup that Amazon has with
Ingram for data feed and distribution.   
As many books as Amazon, better pricing then Amazon & you get points!
From the day we launched, on June 7th, we have been selling over 15,000,000 books.  On October 1st, 2015, we will be launching the ability for independent authors to load their books, and set their own retail price.  When a book sells, the independent author will ship the book and we will pay them the revenue.  For the reading enthusiast, this means a facebook like experience with better service, pricing and perks then Amazon.

<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>not just a place to drink cider. </h3>
<div>Since the start of Texas Keeper, we dove headfirst into the incredible Central Texas food and farming community.  As a wholesaler, we try to take advantage of every opportunity that comes our way to support local food artisans, farms, and agricultural nonprofits by donating our time and cider to fundraisers and other events.  We've worked with Antonelli's and Epicerie to pair cheese and cider, several chefs to host cider and food pairings out at the cidery, including a fundraiser for Greengate Farms due to damages they sustained from the May flooding.  We've supported events benefiting Slow Food Austin, Farmshare, East Austin Urban Farms, and the Austin Fermentation Festival benefiting Central Texas farmers and ranchers.  </div>

</div>
<div>Supporting local small businesses and helping people to connect with their food system are both integral parts of our mission.  <span style=""background-color: initial;"">With the Cidery open to the public, we can expand on this community support, as a great opportunity to host tons of events and fundraisers on-site.   </span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>the challenges.</h3>
<ul> </ul>
<div>So far we have managed to rely on our own doggedness and the support of friends and family to get Texas Keeper off the ground.  We're pretty chuffed with ourselves for setting out goals in our initial business plan and sticking to them, and from learning from the past two years of startup and then sales.  </div>

<div>Now, the taproom is the next step.  While ""DIYing"" will continue to help us keep costs down, we'll need to raise funds for a few things out here that we can't do ourselves or that we have to purchase.<br/>
</div>
<div>Such as:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>We need a cool sign along the road so people know we're here! </li>
<li>We need to build tables and chairs, a bar, and our draught system </li>
<li>We need to rewire much of the old farmhouse</li>
<li>We need to do some roof repair </li>
<li>We are putting in a brand-spanking-new septic system (woo hoo!) </li>
<li>We're refurbishing the old market garden and chicken coop to supply produce to the Cidery </li>
<li>We're getting bees!!!  This spring we'll add 6 hives, harvesting the honey ourselves to make our own cyser (a honey and cider fermented beverage). </li>
</ul>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1445220244/iyme3hrq8kwbkmxjz7ep.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 584.599px; height: 389px;""/></p></div>
</div>
<div>Plus a variety of other bits and bobs we'll need to purchase - glassware, furniture, lighting, paint, etc. - all the little things that'll make the place even cooler than it already is.</div> </div> <div> <h3>we don't just want your money.</h3> <p>Hey, some people just can't contribute in dollars, but that doesn't mean we couldn't use your help!  First, helping us get the word out about our taproom campaign would be hugely useful.  Like us, share our posts on Facebook, instagram, Twitter, etc.  Tell people about us.  If you have any great ideas for the Cidery, we're all ears.  Shoot, just buying our cider helps (not to mention the perk therein for you!).</p>
<p></p>

<p>Also, we'll be holding a couple of workdays out at the Cidery in the next couple of months so if you have a spare Saturday morning, give us a shout.   Specifically, we'll need any willing participants to help clean up the little family cemetery on the property, build tables and benches, and to clean out the vegetable garden to get ready for planting.  We promise to make it worth your while (read: we will pay you in cider and breakfast tacos)!</p>

Check out this gem of land that our little cidery sits on.  Standing out here you wouldn't know it, but we're a mere 14 miles from the state capitol.  We want you to come out and see it!  
Just some of what you can look forward to when we open up to the public:



Right next to our cellar sits an old stone farmhouse that we've just started restoring.  It was once a schoolhouse, but for decades has sat vacant.  This will be our taproom.  Behind the bar we'll serve our own ciders, for the first time on draught, plus a handpicked selection of our favorite ciders from around the world.  We want the Cidery to be a place for you to explore the crazy, varied world of cider.  We'll also serve meads and wines, with special focus on the growing Texas wine industry.  


We personally think our ciders are at their best alongside a great meal, so we'll be offering snack plates made up of local craft foods (cheeses, charcuterie, jams, breads, etc.) AND we'll have a local chef out each weekend to prepare meals that pair great with cider.



Outside, lounge under the live oaks on the stone patio or out in the field, or wander around the grounds with a cold one.  In opening the land to the public, we're helping to preserve an old piece of undeveloped country amidst a part of Austin that's seen immense change in recent years.

Since we'll be selling ciders directly to the public, we'll have more flexibility to try out micro-batches exclusively available on-site ...and we have a lot of ideas fermenting 

In addition to normal taproom hours on the weekend, we'll regularly open up the Cidery for additional special events like food and cider dinners, agricultural and food preservation workshops, and movie nights.  




   not just a place to drink cider. 
Since the start of Texas Keeper, we dove headfirst into the incredible Central Texas food and farming community.  As a wholesaler, we try to take advantage of every opportunity that comes our way to support local food artisans, farms, and agricultural nonprofits by donating our time and cider to fundraisers and other events.  We've worked with Antonelli's and Epicerie to pair cheese and cider, several chefs to host cider and food pairings out at the cidery, including a fundraiser for Greengate Farms due to damages they sustained from the May flooding.  We've supported events benefiting Slow Food Austin, Farmshare, East Austin Urban Farms, and the Austin Fermentation Festival benefiting Central Texas farmers and ranchers.  



Supporting local small businesses and helping people to connect with their food system are both integral parts of our mission.  With the Cidery open to the public, we can expand on this community support, as a great opportunity to host tons of events and fundraisers on-site.   


    the challenges.
 
So far we have managed to rely on our own doggedness and the support of friends and family to get Texas Keeper off the ground.  We're pretty chuffed with ourselves for setting out goals in our initial business plan and sticking to them, and from learning from the past two years of startup and then sales.  

Now, the taproom is the next step.  While ""DIYing"" will continue to help us keep costs down, we'll need to raise funds for a few things out here that we can't do ourselves or that we have to purchase.

Such as:


We need a cool sign along the road so people know we're here! 
We need to build tables and chairs, a bar, and our draught system 
We need to rewire much of the old farmhouse
We need to do some roof repair 
We are putting in a brand-spanking-new septic system (woo hoo!) 
We're refurbishing the old market garden and chicken coop to supply produce to the Cidery 
We're getting bees!!!  This spring we'll add 6 hives, harvesting the honey ourselves to make our own cyser (a honey and cider fermented beverage). 



Plus a variety of other bits and bobs we'll need to purchase - glassware, furniture, lighting, paint, etc. - all the little things that'll make the place even cooler than it already is.   we don't just want your money. Hey, some people just can't contribute in dollars, but that doesn't mean we couldn't use your help!  First, helping us get the word out about our taproom campaign would be hugely useful.  Like us, share our posts on Facebook, instagram, Twitter, etc.  Tell people about us.  If you have any great ideas for the Cidery, we're all ears.  Shoot, just buying our cider helps (not to mention the perk therein for you!).


Also, we'll be holding a couple of workdays out at the Cidery in the next couple of months so if you have a spare Saturday morning, give us a shout.   Specifically, we'll need any willing participants to help clean up the little family cemetery on the property, build tables and benches, and to clean out the vegetable garden to get ready for planting.  We promise to make it worth your while (read: we will pay you in cider and breakfast tacos)!


Check out the great perks on the side.  Thanks to everyone who has gotten us this far, and we thank you all in advance for your continued support.  Can't wait to see y'all out here!",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Minda. My partner is Mandi, and together we own a whimsical, creative shop, called Distorted Utopia. We started out by finding we were more creative than we ever realized, and putting together a small shop. Over time, we have met people on this road, and found out that a lot of people share the same dream. We've met people who create things and want to connect with the people who appreciate what they can do. It's not only about money. There is a sense of accomplishment and sometimes wonder, when you find someone who loves your work, not to mention a huge boost in confidence.  In Springfield, MO, there isn't a lot of opportunity, and often, people lack the confidence, the financial backing, or the willingness to venture out and start a small business. Having done it, we do know the pitfalls and frustrations that come with business ownership. We also know the sense of accomplishment with each small victory. </p>
<p>We have had some events, attended others, and have met amazing artists, authors, makers, and creators. They are good at what they do, the people attending admire their work, and are happy to help them succeed, both with financial support, and a strong cheering section. I love their work too, and have found many times I wish I could do what they do, but lack time or money to learn how to do it, and hear other people say the same thing. But, I want what they made. I want to own it, to show it off, to take it home and be inspired by it. We have people tell us all the time, how much they love this artist, or that maker, or another creation they've seen.</p>
<p>We decided to grow our own business, hoping to have time to be more creative. That's a great goal, but it just didn't seem like enough. Knowing the people we do, the response we've seen, and feeling a strong desire to help other people reach their goals, we knew we were meant to do more. We can bring the artists together, under one roof, with a beautiful space, a snack area, fun, creative events, and grow our business, as well as help them. We can help them connect with the community, inspire others, and I would dare say, help the artistic community in Springfield gain even more of the attention it deserves. Heck, we'll even have a space for classes and table gaming, to bring even more people together. We just know we need some support from you.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>This move will be what we need, in order to keep growing, and sharing opportunities with other creative people! </p> <ul> <li><p>Our goal is to raise $15,000, in order to fund our move. We will use the money as deposits on the new building, shelving and display cases for the other merchants, advertising, signs, tables and chairs for the snack area, and a security system. </p></li>
<li><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our perks range from a downloadable poster of the original Creatopia, to an invitation to exclusive opening night party with the artists. There are cookies, naming a baked good, and even a cool steampunk lamp up for grabs. See our list of perks to find one that speaks to your inner Geek, steampunk, or even your heart.</span></p></li> <li>If we don't raise the entire amount, we will use what we do get, to start small at the new place. We hope to not have to take out any loans, so we can stay debt free.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <p>You can make such a huge impact, even with a small contribution. </p>
<ul>
<li>The more I read about artistic collectives, the more benefits I see to the community as a whole. Tourism is pretty good in this area, and this venue has potential to increase that even more. By having creative items for display and sale, people will become inspired, and can even learn how to do some of it, by taking the classes our makers will give. If you can inspire passion for the arts, you can change lives.</li>
<li>Our biggest event to date was called ""Creatopia"". We invited local artists, makers, authors, and creative types to set up a booth in our current shop. The event was short, just a few hours, but the shop was full. People were excited. Watching social media light it up was a huge thrill. The Springfield Newsleader and KOLR 10 showed up unexpectedly. We already have makers asking for more events, and more spaces. We had artists we couldn't fit into our shop. There is no doubt that this is a needed place for the artistic community, and the people who appreciate it.</li>
<li>We started out with just a small corner full of things at our shop last year. We have grown our inventory multiple times over. We're pretty proud of that, but it pales in comparison to the friends we have made. Since we attend local events, we meet people who support us, and are cheering for our success too. We've made some great connections, and love to bring those people together, so they can cheer for each other. We are not ready to stop.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>We're Doing This</h3>
<ul>
<li>As I said, we started out small. I mean VERY small. We're still pretty small. But we have grown, by using experiences and setting goals. We listen to what our customers want, and work hard to make them happy. We have struggled with growing our business, due in part to our current location. We love where we are, and value our current neighborhood and its residents,  but feel that there just isn't enough traffic to the area to maintain the growth we need in order to stay in business. We're not going to throw in the towel because of this. We have monitored traffic at both the current and the new location, and see a huge difference. We study metrics, watch trends, and ask everyone we talk to about what they know that could help. Our goal is to not only make a living (finally taking a pay check), but to prosper, and develop this business into a hub of creative effort, for everyone involved.</li>
<li>We have a location chosen, and are ready to charge ahead. It's close to the square, on the route for First Friday Art Walk, and is absolutely stunning. There are large display windows, hardwood floors, tin ceilings, and so much character. It's large enough for everything we hope to do: our shop, our creative collective, a bakery and snack shop, classes, events, and table top gaming. We want people to walk in and be wowed. Someone compared what we are doing to Etsy, in person. We want the best of Etsy, mixed with Pinterest, and a lot of whimsy and eclectic handwork thrown in. And cake. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>We understand that not everyone can contribute financially. You can help still help.</p> <ul> <li>Tell everyone you know, and maybe those you don't about this idea. </li> <li>

We will use the money as deposits on the new building, shelving and display cases for the other merchants, advertising, signs, tables and chairs for the snack area, and a security system. 
Our perks range from a downloadable poster of the original Creatopia, to an invitation to exclusive opening night party with the artists. There are cookies, naming a baked good, and even a cool steampunk lamp up for grabs. See our list of perks to find one that speaks to your inner Geek, steampunk, or even your heart. If we don't raise the entire amount, we will use what we do get, to start small at the new place. We hope to not have to take out any loans, so we can stay debt free.    You can make such a huge impact, even with a small contribution. 

The more I read about artistic collectives, the more benefits I see to the community as a whole. Tourism is pretty good in this area, and this venue has potential to increase that even more. By having creative items for display and sale, people will become inspired, and can even learn how to do some of it, by taking the classes our makers will give. If you can inspire passion for the arts, you can change lives.
Our biggest event to date was called ""Creatopia"". We invited local artists, makers, authors, and creative types to set up a booth in our current shop. The event was short, just a few hours, but the shop was full. People were excited. Watching social media light it up was a huge thrill. The Springfield Newsleader and KOLR 10 showed up unexpectedly. We already have makers asking for more events, and more spaces. We had artists we couldn't fit into our shop. There is no doubt that this is a needed place for the artistic community, and the people who appreciate it.
We started out with just a small corner full of things at our shop last year. We have grown our inventory multiple times over. We're pretty proud of that, but it pales in comparison to the friends we have made. Since we attend local events, we meet people who support us, and are cheering for our success too. We've made some great connections, and love to bring those people together, so they can cheer for each other. We are not ready to stop.    We're Doing This

As I said, we started out small. I mean VERY small. We're still pretty small. But we have grown, by using experiences and setting goals. We listen to what our customers want, and work hard to make them happy. We have struggled with growing our business, due in part to our current location. We love where we are, and value our current neighborhood and its residents,  but feel that there just isn't enough traffic to the area to maintain the growth we need in order to stay in business. We're not going to throw in the towel because of this. We have monitored traffic at both the current and the new location, and see a huge difference. We study metrics, watch trends, and ask everyone we talk to about what they know that could help. Our goal is to not only make a living (finally taking a pay check), but to prosper, and develop this business into a hub of creative effort, for everyone involved.
We have a location chosen, and are ready to charge ahead. It's close to the square, on the route for First Friday Art Walk, and is absolutely stunning. There are large display windows, hardwood floors, tin ceilings, and so much character. It's large enough for everything we hope to do: our shop, our creative collective, a bakery and snack shop, classes, events, and table top gaming. We want people to walk in and be wowed. Someone compared what we are doing to Etsy, in person. We want the best of Etsy, mixed with Pinterest, and a lot of whimsy and eclectic handwork thrown in. And cake.     Other Ways You Can Help We understand that not everyone can contribute financially. You can help still help.  Tell everyone you know, and maybe those you don't about this idea.

<h3><b>WHO ARE WE?:</b></h3>
<p>Capitol Guitars is a 100% independent guitar store in Saint Paul, Minnesota offering guitars, basses, amps, accessories, repairs, and lessons.</p>
<p><strong>FIRST LOCATION</strong></p>
<p>For those of you who don't already know us, we are just a couple of guys (Billy Bergeron and Eric Berg), bandmates who had a crazy idea to open a guitar store back in 2004. We scraped together every penny we could and opened our first tiny 600 square foot store on St. Peter street in downtown St. Paul. We managed to keep that going for 6 years until we were ready for something bigger....</p>
<p><b>SECOND (CURRENT) LOCATION</b></p>
<p>We love our current spot here on East 7th in booming Lowertown St. Paul. Since we moved here business has been great and we have even been able to hire several employees (thanks Tom, Tay, Brad, &amp; Steve). The problem is that the area we helped grow and nurture is pricing us out! Rent has increased 20% a year for 3 years in a row and we don't see any sign of it stopping. As you locals know parking can be a bit of a pain too. Which brings us to....</p>
<p><strong>THE NEW (AND FINAL!) CAPITOL GUITARS LOCATION</strong></p>
<p>We have searched long and hard to find a suitable spot for our baby (this business is definitely that important to us!). We have finally found it. 644 Selby Avenue in the up and coming Cathedral Hill neighborhood still right here in St. Paul. This area is growing even faster than lowertown, but this time we will be the proud owners of the building and will actual be able to control our own rent and keep costs down.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's where you all come in. We have the downpayment and can afford the mortgage, but this place needs A LOT of work! $56,380 just to get it up to code. That doesn't even build a single wall or put a stitch of carpet on the floor. It will take about another $45k to turn it into guitar store.</p>
<p>We are offering you a number of very limited, very cool items and services to strum up some cash. Even a First Avenue style star laden wall-of -fame that will permanently showcase our most loyal supporters. Please keep in mind that we are paying for all these items from our vendors so the money we raise is far from all profit. Not a problem though - we didn't want to beg for the money. We want everyone to get something in return.</p>

<p>Oh yeah and did we mention....TONS OF FREE PARKING!!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We want to help revitalize this long neglected area of Saint Paul. There are already tons of really cool restaurants and shops that have recently moved in the neighborhood and we want to be part of the excitement. Also - if we are able keep costs down by avoiding rent increases we will be able to pass the savings along to our customers (you know we like to make deals!) and hire more employees.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We know that prepping and opening a new store is an incredible challenge.  We have done it twice already and have grown our business successfully with each move. With any move there is a great risk of losing some of your core customer base, but we sincerely hope you will all visit us at our new location. Remember it's only a couple miles away!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We're called simply The Store due to a slip of the tongue to the newspaper.  Our full name is Nu-Beginning Farm: The Store, but we'll answer to many things!</p>
<ul>
<li>Nu-Beginning Farm was born in 2003 at the Verona farmers' market with 2 card tables and a box of surplus vegetables in the trunk of the car.  Our first day sales were a staggering $26.25 and a business was born!  From vegetables we expanded to baked goods, jams, pickles and soaps, then to an intern program with James Madison University, to private interns, to homestead classes to the oldest CSA program in Augusta County.  We make it a habit of building on our past successes and helping others succeed along the way.  In high tide all boats float!</li>
<li>We opened our brick &amp; mortar business December 1, 2012 and from day one have tried to give back to the community that has so strongly supported us and our mission. Over the last 4 years at our current location we've grown to the point of bursting at the seams. We've looked longingly across the alley at that nice big empty building behind us, that would allow us to have a real kitchen (rather than our current counter top appliances, hot plates and popping breakers). We finally decided to find the landlord, and did a LARGE amount of research, number crunching, praying, and stressing in a short amount of time. We signed a lease June 1 and started our journey! We'll be able to expand our grocery selection, seat more people in the cafe, and be a real home for local food, art, authors, musicians and actors.  Everything local under one roof...yeah, we can do that!  </li>
<li>It is said that it takes a village to raise a child, well, it takes a group of people wanting to make a difference in order to build that village.  That's the group we want to be in! </li>
<li>Nu-Beginning lives by the Rule Trifecta of ""Speak the Truth, Do the Right Thing, and Take Up for Yourself.""  We have always kept our wonderful team and outstanding customers in the loop of knowledge of what's happening...good or bad.  We're doing the same thing now!  We want to move. We need to, in order to grow properly.  </li>
<li>We've got a great contractor heading up the build-out but all this takes money...and a lot of it. We've applied for and received a line of credit through F&amp;M Bank here in Staunton and this is great to cover much of the construction and equipment, but not all of it.  We have a LOT of work to do, and NEED your help! The goals we've set will be tiered to accomplish various levels in case you don't love us as much as we think and we don't make our final goal. </li>
<li>We hope you'll believe in our project as much as we do!  We think we have a really cool place that can make a difference in the world and provide a living for our team.  Lots of folks like what we do, check us out Tripadvisor and Yelp!  It hasn't been easy to get to this point and it certainly won't be easy to get to the next level, but we're not afraid of hard work, we do our research before we act and we can overcome any obstacle that falls in our path.  We ask you to take the journey with us!  Be a part of our success and the magic we create.  Be part of our family! </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're moving to a great building but we can't do it without your support!</p>
<ul>
<li>We want to raise $100,000 through crowd sourcing to help us move and get needed equipment, as well as some added stability!</li>
<li>Among the needed items are an upgraded register system with a multi-station touch screen POS (point of sale) system. This will allow us to run the grocery and restaurant smoother, let the servers fire tickets directly to the kitchen and monitor inventory, bookkeeping, schedules and operations more accurately. A large capacity ice maker and a commercial dishwasher are next on the list. We'd like to install house lights and sound system to help our artists and performers. Any money left over after that will be used to beautify the garden area, pay down some of the debt, and put some away in a rainy day fund to help cover payroll. The move will take our staffing levels from 15 to about 40! </li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Our perks are set up to be both practical and fun! We have a unique team, with an interesting view of the world, and we'd love you to be a part of it! (Check out the application to join our Zombie Apocalypse team!) It's what makes people love us!  It's what make people describe The Store as ""magical""!</span></li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>By helping our campaign you're helping the community, not just a single business. We're embedded in our community and they're emotionally invested in us! When's the last time a store offered to hold a tab because you forgot you wallet? We do! When's the last time you felt like you were on Cheers! because everyone knows your name? We do! When's the last time you heard of a store telling a husband to call his wife before making a certain purchase because she was in this morning buying the same thing?  We do! Do we sound normal to you? Imagine the impact we can have in a larger building! Imagine the stories you'll have to tell by being a part of the zany group that treats people like...well...people! We feed people. We have fun. We respect each other.   </li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">We ask you to join our campaign and share the fun, the smiles and the ungodly amount of puns that run rampant daily!  </span></li>
</ul>

</div><p>And that's all we've got to say about that.</p></div>","Short Summary
We're called simply The Store due to a slip of the tongue to the newspaper.  Our full name is Nu-Beginning Farm: The Store, but we'll answer to many things!

Nu-Beginning Farm was born in 2003 at the Verona farmers' market with 2 card tables and a box of surplus vegetables in the trunk of the car.  Our first day sales were a staggering $26.25 and a business was born!  From vegetables we expanded to baked goods, jams, pickles and soaps, then to an intern program with James Madison University, to private interns, to homestead classes to the oldest CSA program in Augusta County.  We make it a habit of building on our past successes and helping others succeed along the way.  In high tide all boats float!
We opened our brick & mortar business December 1, 2012 and from day one have tried to give back to the community that has so strongly supported us and our mission. Over the last 4 years at our current location we've grown to the point of bursting at the seams. We've looked longingly across the alley at that nice big empty building behind us, that would allow us to have a real kitchen (rather than our current counter top appliances, hot plates and popping breakers). We finally decided to find the landlord, and did a LARGE amount of research, number crunching, praying, and stressing in a short amount of time. We signed a lease June 1 and started our journey! We'll be able to expand our grocery selection, seat more people in the cafe, and be a real home for local food, art, authors, musicians and actors.  Everything local under one roof...yeah, we can do that!  
It is said that it takes a village to raise a child, well, it takes a group of people wanting to make a difference in order to build that village.  That's the group we want to be in! 
Nu-Beginning lives by the Rule Trifecta of ""Speak the Truth, Do the Right Thing, and Take Up for Yourself.""  We have always kept our wonderful team and outstanding customers in the loop of knowledge of what's happening...good or bad.  We're doing the same thing now!  We want to move. We need to, in order to grow properly.  
We've got a great contractor heading up the build-out but all this takes money...and a lot of it. We've applied for and received a line of credit through F&M Bank here in Staunton and this is great to cover much of the construction and equipment, but not all of it.  We have a LOT of work to do, and NEED your help! The goals we've set will be tiered to accomplish various levels in case you don't love us as much as we think and we don't make our final goal. 
We hope you'll believe in our project as much as we do!  We think we have a really cool place that can make a difference in the world and provide a living for our team.  Lots of folks like what we do, check us out Tripadvisor and Yelp!  It hasn't been easy to get to this point and it certainly won't be easy to get to the next level, but we're not afraid of hard work, we do our research before we act and we can overcome any obstacle that falls in our path.  We ask you to take the journey with us!  Be a part of our success and the magic we create.  Be part of our family! 

 

What We Need & What You Get
We're moving to a great building but we can't do it without your support!

We want to raise $100,000 through crowd sourcing to help us move and get needed equipment, as well as some added stability!
Among the needed items are an upgraded register system with a multi-station touch screen POS (point of sale) system. This will allow us to run the grocery and restaurant smoother, let the servers fire tickets directly to the kitchen and monitor inventory, bookkeeping, schedules and operations more accurately. A large capacity ice maker and a commercial dishwasher are next on the list. We'd like to install house lights and sound system to help our artists and performers. Any money left over after that will be used to beautify the garden area, pay down some of the debt, and put some away in a rainy day fund to help cover payroll. The move will take our staffing levels from 15 to about 40! 
Our perks are set up to be both practical and fun! We have a unique team, with an interesting view of the world, and we'd love you to be a part of it! (Check out the application to join our Zombie Apocalypse team!) It's what makes people love us!  It's what make people describe The Store as ""magical""!


The Impact

By helping our campaign you're helping the community, not just a single business. We're embedded in our community and they're emotionally invested in us! When's the last time a store offered to hold a tab because you forgot you wallet? We do! When's the last time you felt like you were on Cheers! because everyone knows your name? We do! When's the last time you heard of a store telling a husband to call his wife before making a certain purchase because she was in this morning buying the same thing?  We do! Do we sound normal to you? Imagine the impact we can have in a larger building! Imagine the stories you'll have to tell by being a part of the zany group that treats people like...well...people! We feed people. We have fun. We respect each other.   
We ask you to join our campaign and share the fun, the smiles and the ungodly amount of puns that run rampant daily!

<p>We,

Stop (Ann Arbor, MI) and Local Roots (Wooster, OH), but that levels the playing

<p>Like
Argus and Local Roots, we will provide an accessible and convenient venue for Michigan
growers and producers to sell their products, retain their identity and earn a
living wage with 70 cents of every dollar sold going directly back to their

in the last year that Argus Farm Stop was able to return nearly $1 million back
to farms throughout Michigan in 2015 alone!</p>

</div><div> <p>LuLaRoe provides real clothing for real people. Their styles are versatile, comfortable, and appropriate for work or play as they are both modest and fun. LuLaRoe is unique and fosters an environment conducive to growth between all consultants worldwide harboring customers of all bodytypes! Best of all, LuLaRoe was started by a woman and her family and the importance of family and community is stressed every step of the way. </p>
<p>Some reasons I have chosen to support LuLaRoe in my personal life and now professional life:</p> <ul> <li>Clothing is designed for people of all bodies- from 00 - 22 (with wiggle room in either direction, and in between!)</li>
<li>Patterns are unique with only approximately 2000 articles of clothing made from any one material. Ever. This means that if you see something, you may be the only one in your area to wear it nonetheless know it exists! </li> <li>Necklines on shirts and dresses and lengths on skirts and dresses are modest enough for work but not frumpy, which means you can wear the same comfortable outfit to work and then out again at night!</li>
<li>LuLaRoe supports its consultants and has a community that is warm and inviting. Between giveaways and webinars, the company and its consultants are proud to be involved!</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>How This Campaign Works</h3> <p>This campaign is to help me afford the initial startup package of inventory (~  500 pieces of clothing) , accessories such as lighting supplies, mannequins, backdrops, etc., packaging supplies, and printed supplies like business cards.</p>
<p>Instead of asking for money without offering rewards, I have chosen to use this IndieGoGo campaign as a means of pre-selling my initial inventory. Should you choose to donate to my campaign, once I get my initial inventory you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>...be added to a private Facebook group accessible ONLY to those who donate - a VIP group!</li>
<li>...have first choice at any of the items I receive at the price point you donated for (eg: donate enough for a pair of leggings? you can choose whichever pair of leggings you would like!)</li>
<li>...get free shipping on your pre-ordered purchase! Perk prices indicate the cost of the item with NYC sales tax, but shipping will be free for pre-orders. Normally, shipping is $3 for one item, $6 for 2 or more, and free for orders over $75.</li> <li>...get a random coupon for your purchases at my official launch party which will happen after my VIPs make their choices</li> </ul>

<h3>MOTIVATION AND VISION</h3>
<p><strong>Light is life</strong> – Sunlight hitting the Earth would be too harsh without the natural lens formed by our planet’s atmosphere. This filters the light and absorbs dangerous rays, turning the Sun into a dynamic source of pleasant light capable of creating infinite shades of colour from red to blue and making life on Earth possible in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>Light is well-being</strong> – The discovery in 2002 of a third type of photoreceptor in the human eye proves that our level of well-being is influenced significantly by how much dynamic natural light we consume over the course of a day. On the other hand, artificial man-made light can have a detrimental effect on visual perception and create a “negative environment” in indoor areas that harms our sense of well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Natural-like light</strong> – The FIFTH AVENUE IN WOOD lighting series uses state-of-the-art technology and the latest scientific knowledge in a quest to create a healthy and pleasant “positive environment”—a major challenge.</p>
<h3> </h3>
</div><h3>PERFECT LIGHTING TECHNOLOGY</h3><p>Thanks to the development of an aspheric lens system and the use of high-power LEDs it was possible to create a 70° beam of light. The operational efficiency of the luminaire is over 80%. These two factors provide the decisive advantage when comparing FIFTH AVENUE IN WOOD with conventional LED lighting systems. A conscious decision was taken to avoid the use of diffusers or reflective light direction systems. The result is a lighting system that is extremely efficient thanks to its top-of-the-range electronic components and LEDs as well as its unique optimised lens system which transmits up to 15% more light. Mathematical and physical<br/>calculations, accompanied by a variety of lighting simulations, have made it possible to create the perfect lens system for efficient glass production.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480249181/nmp4x1ozu1lnotmgw4sr.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Light distribution curve of FIFTH AVENUE IN WOOD<br/>5x lenses basic module (5 x 3W LED)<br/>with aspheric lenses shining downwards<br/>1 x 3W LED shining upwards<br/>(ceiling lighting)<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480248882/cmjsnbld7ogwdsdwrdpx.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><div>

<h3>MAXIMUM DURABILITY</h3>
<p>FIFTH AVENUE IN WOOD has been developed in line with the following certification standards:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>DIN EN ISO 14040</strong> – Life cycle assessment</li>
<li>
<strong>DIN EN ISO 14044</strong> – Assessment and analysis of the environmental impact of products</li>
<li>
<strong>DIN ISO 15226</strong> – Technical product documentation related to life cycle</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike many lighting systems on the market, FIFTH AVENUE IN WOOD is not a disposable product. The specially designed cooling system with the black cooling component ensures an operating life of more than 25,000 hours. The entire electric switching and plug system is also designed for maximum durability.</p>
<p>The lighting system is exceptionally efficient, resulting in low energy consumption and significantly reducing costs over the course of its lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>The light can be recycled.</strong><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480249451/wlqt5phc3cwpqihnbry7.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>TIMELESS DESIGN</h3>
<p>Timeless ideas, such as those formulated by Horatio Greenough on organic principles and those from Louis Henry Sullivan and Walter Gropius on architecture and design, lie at the heart of the modular construction and elegant forms found in FIFTH AVENUE IN WOOD.</p>
<p>“Form follows function” as an expression of constructive logic was the driving principle behind this exceptional lighting system. The contours of the aspheric lenses used by FIFTH AVENUE IN WOOD are precisely calculated and characterised by simple, natural lines.

<p>Sitio Baybay is a beautiful place. It lies close to the mouth of the Tanjay River, a waterway that springs from the foothills near the mountain ridge bisecting the island of Negros. In another time, this would have been a pristine mangrove forest, the silence punctuated only by the occasional bird call and the sound of the water passing through the shallows. These days, its natural beauty is dimmed by the very real human suffering close by.</p>

<p>Sitio Baybay is one of the poorest communities in the Philippines. The economic resurgence that many in the urban areas enjoy has never touched the people in this sleepy fishing village. Ignored for the most part by the government and by people from the outside, the inhabitants of Sitio Baybay make a living through small-scale shoreline fishing, selling of driftwood, harvesting nipa leaves (palm fronds used for thatching), and odd jobs in the nearby coconut and corn fields.</p>

<p>The people in this village suffer from grinding and debilitating poverty, hunger, and want. There’s limited electricity and no water service in Sitio Baybay. None of the houses have any working toilet, people defecate outside exposing the children to various diseases and contagions because of the unsanitary conditions.</p>

<p>The houses are made of very light materials (bamboo and palm fronds) making their occupants highly vulnerable to the tropical typhoons that batter the islands regularly.

</div></div>","On Saturday, January 28, 2017 Casa Esperanza of Angels Foundation volunteers will visit Sitio Baybay, in Tanjay City, Philippines to distribute toys, food, and grocery items to the children and their families in this impoverished fishing village. The volunteers will also be leading the children through a few dance and song numbers to liven up the occasion and bring cheer to this community. We need your help to make this happen.



Sitio Baybay is a beautiful place. It lies close to the mouth of the Tanjay River, a waterway that springs from the foothills near the mountain ridge bisecting the island of Negros. In another time, this would have been a pristine mangrove forest, the silence punctuated only by the occasional bird call and the sound of the water passing through the shallows. These days, its natural beauty is dimmed by the very real human suffering close by.

<h3><u>Short Summary:</u></h3>
<p>I have been in the culinary industry professionally for the last 14 years, but I have had a passion for cooking since I was 5 years old. Over the last decade, I  have been in several culinary venues including Executive Chef at 21 years old at a wine and jazz bar, Executive Chef of a corporate catering company, garde manger chef at the Thunderbird School of Global Management, culinary arts teacher at a high school, and most recently chef for the Seattle Mariners baseball team for Spring Training. </p>
<p>I have always had a passion for catering and teaching. I feel now is the time to jump head first into operating my own small business and take the leap into creating a budding entrepreneurship with my endeavor into Martial Chef Catering.</p>
<p>Recently I have registered myself on Thumbtack and have received quite a few requests for catering services and private in-home cooking lessons. Not only have I had some very successful events already such as a musical recital, graduation party, bridal shower, but I've had very successful private in-home cooking lessons, and that's just with only a little over 2 months on Thumbtack. </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>What I'm Asking For:</u></h3>
<p>Right now I'm asking for $1500 to help achieve some of my goals for the business. That includes: </p>
<ul><li>
<u><strong>Supplies:</strong></u> The money that I raise would help in purchasing platters, chafing dishes, utensils, table decor, flatware, etc.... to help build up my inventory for my business.</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<u><strong>Marketing:</strong></u>The money that I raise will help fund the credits that are required to be purchased for Thumbtack so that I can continue to respond to quotes and  would also help go to funding  various marketing supplies such as: <span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>business cards, Foursquare, ads, creating a website, boosting posts on Facebook, etc...</span>
</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>
<u><strong>Community Kitchen:</strong></u> The money that I raise will also help go to finding and renting a community kitchen. That way I can offer a centrally located setting for customers and potential clients to take cooking lessons, or even have consulations with me for their catering needs. </li></ul>
<h3><u>The Impact:</u></h3>
<p>For those of you that don't know breaking into the restaurant business or even catering business is unbelievably hard and within the first year of launching doesn't have the best success rate. Those that do know me personally know how much passion and drive I have for creating something that's my own. You would not only be helping and donating to a small local business but you'd be helping in taking a small part in making my dreams come true. You can tell everyone that you were a part of helping make a super passionate, incredibly hard working chefs dreams come true. </p>
<ul></ul>
</div><div>
<h3><u>Other Ways You Can Help:</u></h3>
<p>It's entirely understandable to me that not everyone can help monetarily in making my small business succeed, but if you can't there's other ways as well. Word of mouth is one of the best forms of marketing so I just ask to please share, get the word out and make sure to use the Indiegogo share tools to get the word out on social media. </p>

You can tell everyone that you were a part of helping make a super passionate, incredibly hard working chefs dreams come true. 


Other Ways You Can Help:
It's entirely understandable to me that not everyone can help monetarily in making my small business succeed, but if you can't there's other ways as well. Word of mouth is one of the best forms of marketing so I just ask to please share, get the word out and make sure to use the Indiegogo share tools to get the word out on social media.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>About me and my company</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/bbcustominstruments"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BB Custom Instruments</a> was founded in 2014 as a hobby to try and see if I could actually build some quality instruments at competitive prices, while using as high a percentage of USA made parts as possible. Here is a little information about me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Live sound engineer for 20 years working with local and touring bands</li>
<li>Professional musician since age 16, playing bass, guitar, keyboards and singing</li>
<li>Woodworker and engraver for past 10 years.</li>
</ul>
<p>What will I use your helpful contribution for?</p>
<ul>
<li>Raw materials to build as many guitars as possible in the received budget</li>
<li>Finishing equipment (one airbrush system to create sunburst finishes)</li>
<li>Shipping materials to send instruments to soldiers</li>
<li>Helping to fund teaching staff</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Let me break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are hoping for a minimum of $3500 in funding</li>
<li>We are offering a few perks, if you pledge $150 you will get a ""body mistake"" turned into a wall art clock.</li>
<li>If you pledge $1000 you will get a complete guitar from one of our production models that are forthcoming</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Am I sure I can do this?</h3>
<p>So if you have read this far you are probably asking if I can even accomplish this. Well I have built every instrument you see in the pictures for this campaign, they were all learning experiences and I feel that I am finally ready and able to produce these instruments in quantity, I just need a little help from some thoughtful people who share my desire to give back and invest in our vets.</p>
<h3>Why am I doing this</h3>
<p>My father was a navy vet, the guitarist in my band is a 20 yr army vet, I know of 3 other local vets that are musicians, and I didn't realize that most of them I talked to actually have PTSD either mild or some really bad. Some manage on their own, some have actually used music therapy as a source of relief and refocusing which has helped them to live a better quality of life.  There are a ton more applicants so far than there are instruments to go around and this is the only way I know of that I can help. This will DIRECTLY help Vets in the Delmarva area and will be hosted out of American Legion Post 28 in Oak Orchard DE</p>
</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some people just can't contribute, I get that,  but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about my campaign.</li>
<li>Post to your musician friends on their facebook page</li>
<li>Create a stir about my idea in your local community</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><i>Everybody needs a haircut, right?  </i></strong></p>
<p>I always enjoyed getting my hair cut. I even liked going to the barbershop and experiencing its comradery and community. What I didn’t like, though, was the countless hours I’ve spent over the years waiting to be seen by my barber. Most barbers have the best of intentions, but even they can’t always control the unpredictable nature of their schedules. If one customer shows up 15 minutes late, it has a ripple effect that can throw everyone’s day off. I know that has happened to me countless times. Still, I kept on going because I didn’t have another option. </p>
<p><i><strong>That’s why I created Mobile Kutz. </strong></i>Mobile Kutz is a new mobile application that brings the barbershop to you, wherever you are. We provide high-quality on-demand grooming services from some of Chicago’s finest barbers. Mobile Kutz allows you to avoid unpredictable barbershop waits and take back your day all within a matter of minutes.</p>
<p><u><strong>Mobile Kutz solves three problems</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, with our app, customers have complete control over the time they actually receive their haircuts. We guarantee that our barbers will arrive within a 10-minute scheduled window. And once there, they will provide you with quick and quality haircuts.</p>
<p><strong>Second</strong>, Mobile Kutz allows customers to try out new barbers easily. We will pair our customers with talented and seasoned Chicago barbers. We’re already working with an experienced barber consultant to support us as we begin recruiting skilled pros.</p>
<p><strong>Lastly</strong>, in this time of economic strain, Mobile Kutz will be a job-provider for hard-working folks within the Chicago community. Our goal isn’t to take business away from your local barbershop. Instead, we strive to help barbers maximize their earnings and build their clientele whenever they have time to do a cut.</p>
<p><u><strong><i>This is where you come in</i></strong></u></p>
<p>We are <i>so close</i> to finishing the Mobile Kutz app. We plan on launching in the spring of 2017, but in order to do so we need to raise $10,000 to finish the development of our app! Sounds like a lot, but if we all pitch in it’s truly a small feat. Honestly. <i><strong>We’re asking that you invest in our idea with whatever donation you can afford.</strong></i> Big or small, everything helps, and we mean it. <strong><i>If 500 people to donated $20 </i></strong>we'd reach our goal in no time<strong><i>.</i></strong> It’s that simple!</p>
<p><u><strong>Do you believe in Mobile Kutz?</strong></u></p>
<p>Are you willing to support a local business working to revolutionize the hair industry? Do you want to help barbers in our community increase their earnings and expand their clientele? If the answer is yes to either of these questions, then <i><strong>please give!</strong></i> Don’t forget to check out our awesome rewards. We thank you for your generosity. And spread the word!</p>

<p>Hi, I'm Mary Neville. I wear a lot of hats; I'm a project manager, a mom, a grandma, an author, and an entrepreneur all rolled up into one.</p>
<p>Being a parent and working in educational software, I've developed a strong passion for helping kids learn through inspiration. I’ve seen firsthand how children can be inspired in so many ways: through words, pictures, music, and play. That’s why I’m opening Nevalia’s—a place where children can be whisked away to a world of whimsy.</p>
<p>Over the past 20 years, I have been in property management and the software industry as a project manager, managing programs and projects. I hold a project management professional (PMP) certification. How does one  go from managing properties to managing software development projects? Technology was a hobby at first - something fun to research and learn and I loved managing in complex, fast-paced situations. I ended up gradually marrying the two passions and spent the last 11 years working at a tech company in Minnesota.</p>
<p>I also enjoy being creative. I have written short stories, written scripts, and collaborated with my sister to write many original songs. I've also been writing children's stories and songs since my daughter was very young. Recently, my granddaughter, Nora, inspired me to create the storybook character, Nevalia: a curious toddler who spends her days joyfully discovering the world around her. The book is written based on a song I wrote and sang to my daughter when she was very young. I recorded the song and am giving it away free with each book purchase.</p>

Nevalia's
Nevalia's is a small business founded by Mary Neville. Nevalia's offers books, music, toys, and learning opportunities for children.
Check out our online shop where you can discover special children's gifts for any occasion. There you can also find Mary's original children's book, Nevalia's Wonders, for which our business is named.
Soon Nevalia's is opening a brick and mortar shop in Blaine, Minnesota. All donations, as well as purchases in our online store, go towards helping this dream come true.
Goals and Vision
Nevalia's will be a positive influence and will create experiences that lift up our core values:
Every child is to be celebrated.
We want your child to have the experience of feeling celebrated for who they are. That's why Nevalia's will treat your child like the prince or princess that they are from the moment they step into the door until the moment they leave.
At Nevalia's, your child can play dress up or do other imaginative play. They can celebrate their birthday, receive a sprinkling of fairy dust, and can attend other celebratory events.
We are also partnering with Kelly Jendro to launch the Kelly's Kids program that will work with local organizations and businesses to provide all-inclusive birthday parties and experiences for underprivileged children.

Reading and writing make up the foundation of all learning.
We will have books available for your child to read in the play area. We will also offer books in our gift shop and online.
Your child can attend story-time, create stories on the magnetic poetry/story board using picture and word magnets, and can participate in special events and contests that encourage your child to get excited about reading, writing, and using their imagination for storytelling.

Music and art greatly influence academic learning.
Nevalia's will have music playing in the Nevalia's store and will offer songs for purchase in our gift shop and online.
We will have a coloring table where your child can get creative with drawing and coloring. We will hold special events and contests that encourage your child to learn and share through music and art.
Nevalia's is also partnering with Music Together to offer music and creative movement classes for children and their families.

Balanced learning can prepare children for their future.
In addition to reading, writing, music, and art as mentioned above, we also will encourage STEM learning activities (STEM = science, technology, engineering, and math).
In the Nevalia's playroom, your child will have the option to play with toys that promote STEM learning and can participate in special events that promote STEM learning.
We have future plans to add a kitchen in our shop for creating mini baked confections. When this addition is added, we will offer baking classes that will teach your child the science behind baking where they can participate in experiments while having fun with baking.

The well-being of every child.
At Nevalia's, your child can participate in special events and contests that promote their overall well-being. We are also in discussions for a future partnership with a local yoga instructor to offer special kids yoga classes that will promote their spiritual and physical well-being.

Nevalia’s is committed to helping kids love to learn. This involves helping parents too! Subscribe and follow us on Facebook to receive tips and encouragement along the way.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Welcome to the Tour Cascadia Pre-Launch </p>
<p><strong>   Who are we?</strong></p>
<p>  Tour Cascadia is a Wine and Adventure tourism company. Our goal is to create fully customizable and completely unique experiences for each of our guests.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  I'm Wesley and my wife's name is Jordan. Together we make up the entire team of Tour Cascadia. When we got married in 2014, we decided to stay in the area and create lives that were community and area focused. This valley has always been my home, I grew up 25 miles from where we live now. Jordan calls the South home, but has now been living in the Valley for over 10 years. The farmers, wine makers, tasting room staff, and chefs are our neighbors and our friends.  </p>
<p>  Jordan currently works as a host at a tasting room and I have been driving Wine Tours since 2013. We decided that this place is where we want to be, and that we wanted to share our experience with you. Between the two of us, we have our ear to the  ground and have access to special people and special wine experiences. We enjoy hiking immensely and thus, decided that building a business around our passions was the most logical and life giving thing to do. On our days off, you can find us in tasting rooms across the valley doing ""homework"". We are so excited to share our knowledge, experience and access with you.</p>
<p>  We need your help. When we decided to bootstrap the startup costs, we knew that we would still need the help and support of our community. We also decided that we wouldn't ask for anything without providing something in return for at least the amount contributed, but hoping to offer even more. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>  We are looking to raise $5,000. This money will go straight into the startup costs of getting Tour Cascadia up and running. </p>
<p>  In exchange for your contributions we have put together perks and packages that will equal your contribution in value. Regardless of whether we reach the goal of 5K, the money raised will still go towards startup costs and you will still receive your package!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>  Most of the hard work is done and we are so excited to hit the road! </p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div>
<p>Tell everyone you know that there is a new tour company in town!</p>
<p>We know that it isn't possible for everyone that wants to contribute to do so monetarily. We would be just as grateful if you would go like the Facebook page, follow our Instagram and check out the website!</p>

<h2>Why Persnickety Books?</h2>
<p>In 2017, Shawna and Herb came to Burlington, NC. They, like any newcomer to a community, looked upon our historic Downtown with fresh eyes. They saw small business owners and entrepreneurs setting up shops and working to shape the future of our historic Downtown Main Street. That collection of businesses included a coffee shop, record store, consignment shops, photography studios, office spaces, co-working hangouts, the theater, bars, and restaurants, but they saw that something was missing. A used bookstore.</p>
<p>As serial entrepreneurs, they were no strangers to starting a business. They dove in headfirst, finding a place, crafting the name “Persnickety Books,” collecting shelves and stocking them with books. The shop took form organically. One box of books at a time. As the books filled the shelves, categories began to form. History here, poetry there, colorful kids books in the corner, fiction, fantasy, and mystery finding their way onto every shelf and surface available. People gradually discovered this new place, a comfortable, casual den of literary diversity. There are adventure stories, but the real adventure is skimming through along the shelves and chancing upon a book that you would have never thought to read before laying eyes on it.</p>
<p>Shawna and Herb loved every book, every customer, and every corner of their rapidly growing store. But sometimes life has other plans, and it became apparent that, due to some personal family challenges, Shawna and Herb were going to have to move back to Oregon. Persnickety was doing well, and they knew that downtown Burlington needed to keep a used bookstore, so they began the search to find new owners to take over their passion project. As entrepreneurs ourselves, with a number of successful businesses and products behind us, plus Ian’s role as Mayor of Burlington, this opportunity excited us. We loved the potential we saw in this little store, so we made the decision to step in and purchase the store from Shawna and Herb.</p>
<p>The books make their way to the shop from many sources. Some have owners who have long since passed and they come to us in dusty boxes out of dim basements and storage units. Others have been lovingly lifted from bright shelves, treasured by their owners, and they are traded in to make room for new volumes. Wherever their source, it is our mission to help find them a new person to inspire.</p>
<p>To make sure that books find their next chapter, it takes sorting, cleaning, un-dog-earing, and cataloging. They must be hauled box-by-box, cart-by-cart to their next destination. And that’s where we hit upon a truly wonderful partnership. In our community of Burlington, North Carolina, there are two outstanding organizations which have made it their mission to help men and women transition out of prison and back into public life. The process of regaining society’s trust is painfully slow, and the rent check is due every month in the meantime. Steady work is one of the largest hurdles faced by former-felons, as they are often denied jobs before they have a chance to prove themselves, simply because of the stigma of their backstory (or previous life chapters).</p>
<p>From that awareness of the community need, coupled with the fact that Persnickety Books was already giving books a second, third, or twentieth chance, we embarked upon this incredible partnership. We have combined efforts with <a href=""http://www.sustainablealamance.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sustainable Alamance</a> and <a href=""http://benevolencefarm.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Benevolence Farm</a> to provide part-time and eventually full-time employment for the men and women in their programs. These are the people who will help us tote, prepare, and stock all your books, by the boxload, cartload, and truckload. As these people transition towards self-sufficiency, returning to their homes and families, their employment with Persnickety Books will help them stay on track and reduce recidivism. With these partnerships, we realized that our new mission statement was obvious, “Giving books and people a second chance”</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Combined with our new mission along with the bookstore that Shawna and Herb have created, we desire to be a place for people to discover the world and themselves. We desire to be a place where there are always new books popping up on the shelves. Where you can discover new genres that keep your imagination inspired. Where children can find their new favorite story and their parents can always afford to say yes to their child's selection.  And where books, ideas, people, and all of their stories come together in the heart of our community.</p>
<p>But like any small business, we face many challenges. To help more books find their next people and homes, we need more shelves, more reading spaces, and all the bits and pieces that go along with that. Persnickety Books is growing and new customers are discovering us every day. The need for employment opportunities by Sustainable Alamance and Benevolence Farm is only growing. That is why we are asking for your help. By contributing to our campaign, you are helping us accelerate the pace of our expansion and the scale of our community impact. If we hit our goal of $50,000 we will be able to expand our off-site book sorting to enable us to accept many more trade-ins and donations and find new homes for those books. We’ll also be able to create more employment opportunities that will pay a living wage and help more former felons become contributing citizens again.</p>
<p>If we exceed our goal, then we will begin our search for a larger store location. With that, we hope to partner with other downtown entrepreneurs to co-locate with a cafe, co-working space, or other complimentary business that will enhance the vibe of the bookstore and make it an even more inviting place to visit. Join us in redefining what a neighborhood used bookstore can be while also creating second chances across our community. Plus, we would love to share this business model with others around the country and the world. Your support helps it start right here.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The bookstore market is filled with challenges. We recognize that this won't be easy. However, our research has shown us that community support for this store is strong. We have structured our business so that at a minimum we can continue to provide a great local bookstore for our community. The team that we have assembled has over a half-century business experience in creating efficient and successful operations like this. Our partnerships with Sustainable Alamance and Benevolence Farm have provided us with extensive guidance and support for the successful hiring of people with criminal records. Coupled with their wrap-around support services, our program represents one of the best opportunities for success.</p>

</div></div>","Why Persnickety Books?
In 2017, Shawna and Herb came to Burlington, NC. They, like any newcomer to a community, looked upon our historic Downtown with fresh eyes. They saw small business owners and entrepreneurs setting up shops and working to shape the future of our historic Downtown Main Street. That collection of businesses included a coffee shop, record store, consignment shops, photography studios, office spaces, co-working hangouts, the theater, bars, and restaurants, but they saw that something was missing. A used bookstore.
As serial entrepreneurs, they were no strangers to starting a business.

<h3><font color=""#4B0082"">(English version will follow)</font></h3>
<h3><font color=""#4B0082"">Notre mission</font></h3>
<p>Depuis 2013, l’organisme à but non lucratif Kina8at (prononcer Kinawat, signifie ""ensemble"" en algonquin ou anicinape) permet la guérison et la reconnexion culturelle des Premières Nations, en plus de favoriser la réconciliation et le partage des cultures autochtones avec tous, par le biais de programmes de formation, de sensibilisation et de ressourcement, inspirés de la philosophie et des traditions des Premières Nations. Le but est d’aider particulièrement la jeunesse, car il est important pour les jeunes autochtones de retrouver la philosophie de leurs ancêtres. </p>
<h3><font color=""#4B0082"">Notre campagne</font></h3>
<p>L’équipe et les cofondateurs de Kina8at, Dominique Rankin, chef héréditaire algonquin et Marie-Josée Tardif, sillonnent les routes du Québec comme à l’international afin de transmettre leurs enseignements. Nomades, nous caressions depuis longtemps le rêve de nous enraciner dans la forêt, près d'une belle étendue d'eau, et de construire un centre culturel et écotouristique regroupant nos activités. Nous y sommes presque ! Nous venons d’acheter un terrain à La Conception, dans la région des Laurentides, au Québec. Situé au cœur d’une forêt mature et mixte, avec un accès à l’eau, ce centre de tourisme autochtone durable sera le seul en son genre à l’Est du Canada.</p>
<p>Notre objectif est d’offrir d’ici 2020 une gamme complète d’activités avec un centre d’hébergement, un pavillon d’accueil, un centre culturel et un pavillon d’enseignement. Nous avons besoin de votre soutien pour incarner notre vision dès cet hiver 2018. </p>
<p><strong>L’objectif de cette campagne est de financer l’achat d’équipements et de matériaux de qualité pour ériger trois tentes de prospecteurs et ainsi démarrer rapidement les activités sur le terrain. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Grâce à vous, nous pourrons acheter :  </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3 toiles pour les tentes de prospecteurs</li>
<li>3 planchers (bois, isolant, vis, corde, etc.)</li>
<li>3 poêles à bois</li>
<li>des meubles (lits superposés, chaises, tablettes)</li>
<li>du bois de chauffage</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Plus votre soutien sera conséquent, plus rapidement nous pourrons vous recevoir dans les prochains mois.  </strong></p>
<p>Une fois l’objectif de cette campagne atteint, vos contributions supplémentaires permettront de construire un bloc sanitaire plus complet, d’acquérir d’autres tentes de prospecteurs et de bénéficier plus rapidement de l’aide technique pour débuter la construction des installations permanentes en 2019. Votre soutien est essentiel à la continuité de la réalisation de notre mission ! </p>

</div><div>
<h3><font color=""#4B0082"">Notre impact</font></h3>
<p>Les profits générés par les activités sur le site seront réinvestis et permettront notamment de faire rayonner davantage nos ateliers de sensibilisation aux cultures autochtones, de financer des stages de reconnexion culturelle pour les Autochtones, de former des passeurs de culture, d’impliquer les aînés et les jeunes autochtones dans nos projets. </p>
<p>À plus long terme, nous souhaitons que le centre culturel soit au cœur du développement socio-économique de la région des Laurentides et soit un carrefour de transmission culturelle de plusieurs communautés autochtones. Dans un monde où l’urgence d’un rapprochement entre les peuples se fait indéniablement sentir, la réappropriation culturelle et la réconciliation avec les Autochtones se doit d’être mise de l’avant. Cette rencontre doit se faire dans un environnement sain, respectant les principes du développement durable. Lieu de ressourcement et de guérison, le centre culturel et touristique de Kina8at sera un lieu unique qui permettra d’offrir la possibilité de réconciliation pour les Autochtones avec leur culture, de créer un espace pour que les peuples se rencontrent, d’apprendre à se connaître et se comprendre. </p>
<p><strong>Encourager Kina8at c’est participer ensemble à la réconciliation avec les Premiers peuples, c'est contribuer à faire rayonner les cultures autochtones et permettre aux Autochtones de reconnecter avec leur culture.</strong></p>

<h3><strong><font color=""#4B0082"">Our mission</font></strong></h3>
<p>Since 2013, the non-profit organization Kina8at (pronounced Kinawat) has been providing healing and cultural reappropriation to First Nations, as well as fostering reconciliation and sharing Aboriginal cultures with all, through Awareness and resourcing, inspired by the philosophy and traditions of First Nations. The goal is to help youth in particular, as it is important for Aboriginal youth to rediscover the philosophy of their ancestors.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong><font color=""#4B0082"">Fund raising</font></strong></h3>
<p>The team and co-founders of Kina8at, Dominique Rankin, Hereditary Chief Algonquin and Marie-Josée Tardif, browse the roads of Quebec and internationally to transmit their teachings. Nomads, we have long had the dream of rooting ourselves on the anicinape territory and building a cultural and ecotourism center grouping our activities. We are almost there ! We have just bought a lot in La Conception, in the Laurentides region of Quebec. Located in a mature, mixed forest with access to water, this sustainable Aboriginal tourism center will be the only one of its kind in Eastern Canada. </p>
<p>Our goal is to offer by 2020 a complete range of activities with a shelter, a reception pavilion, a cultural center and a teaching pavilion. We need your support to embody our vision as early as this winter of 2018. </p>
<p>The objective of this campaign is to finance the purchase of equipment and quality materials to erect three prospector tents and thus quickly start the activities in the field. </p>
<p>With your contribution, we will be able to buy:</p>
<p>- 3 canvases for prospectors' tents</p>
<p>- 3 floors (wood, insulation, screws, rope, etc.)</p>
<p>- 3 wood burning stoves</p>
<p>- furniture (bunk beds, chairs, tablets)</p>
<p>- firewood</p>
<p> The more your support is consistent, the sooner we can receive you in the coming months on our new site. Once our objectives have been achieved, we will be able to build a more complete sanitary block with your additional contribution, acquire other prospector tents and benefit more quickly from technical assistance to start the construction of the permanent installations in 2019.</p>
<p><u>Your support is essential to the continuity of the achievement of our mission</u></p>

Notre mission
Depuis 2013, l’organisme à but non lucratif Kina8at (prononcer Kinawat, signifie ""ensemble"" en algonquin ou anicinape) permet la guérison et la reconnexion culturelle des Premières Nations, en plus de favoriser la réconciliation et le partage des cultures autochtones avec tous, par le biais de programmes de formation, de sensibilisation et de ressourcement, inspirés de la philosophie et des traditions des Premières Nations. Le but est d’aider particulièrement la jeunesse, car il est important pour les jeunes autochtones de retrouver la philosophie de leurs ancêtres. 
Notre campagne
L’équipe et les cofondateurs de Kina8at, Dominique Rankin, chef héréditaire algonquin et Marie-Josée Tardif, sillonnent les routes du Québec comme à l’international afin de transmettre leurs enseignements. Nomades, nous caressions depuis longtemps le rêve de nous enraciner dans la forêt, près d'une belle étendue d'eau, et de construire un centre culturel et écotouristique regroupant nos activités. Nous y sommes presque ! Nous venons d’acheter un terrain à La Conception, dans la région des Laurentides, au Québec. Situé au cœur d’une forêt mature et mixte, avec un accès à l’eau, ce centre de tourisme autochtone durable sera le seul en son genre à l’Est du Canada.
Notre objectif est d’offrir d’ici 2020 une gamme complète d’activités avec un centre d’hébergement, un pavillon d’accueil, un centre culturel et un pavillon d’enseignement. Nous avons besoin de votre soutien pour incarner notre vision dès cet hiver 2018. 
L’objectif de cette campagne est de financer l’achat d’équipements et de matériaux de qualité pour ériger trois tentes de prospecteurs et ainsi démarrer rapidement les activités sur le terrain. 
Grâce à vous, nous pourrons acheter :  

3 toiles pour les tentes de prospecteurs
3 planchers (bois, isolant, vis, corde, etc.)
3 poêles à bois
des meubles (lits superposés, chaises, tablettes)
du bois de chauffage

Plus votre soutien sera conséquent, plus rapidement nous pourrons vous recevoir dans les prochains mois.  
Une fois l’objectif de cette campagne atteint, vos contributions supplémentaires permettront de construire un bloc sanitaire plus complet, d’acquérir d’autres tentes de prospecteurs et de bénéficier plus rapidement de l’aide technique pour débuter la construction des installations permanentes en 2019. Votre soutien est essentiel à la continuité de la réalisation de notre mission ! 
 


Notre impact
Les profits générés par les activités sur le site seront réinvestis et permettront notamment de faire rayonner davantage nos ateliers de sensibilisation aux cultures autochtones, de financer des stages de reconnexion culturelle pour les Autochtones, de former des passeurs de culture, d’impliquer les aînés et les jeunes autochtones dans nos projets. 
À plus long terme, nous souhaitons que le centre culturel soit au cœur du développement socio-économique de la région des Laurentides et soit un carrefour de transmission culturelle de plusieurs communautés autochtones. Dans un monde où l’urgence d’un rapprochement entre les peuples se fait indéniablement sentir, la réappropriation culturelle et la réconciliation avec les Autochtones se doit d’être mise de l’avant. Cette rencontre doit se faire dans un environnement sain, respectant les principes du développement durable. Lieu de ressourcement et de guérison, le centre culturel et touristique de Kina8at sera un lieu unique qui permettra d’offrir la possibilité de réconciliation pour les Autochtones avec leur culture, de créer un espace pour que les peuples se rencontrent, d’apprendre à se connaître et se comprendre. 
Encourager Kina8at c’est participer ensemble à la réconciliation avec les Premiers peuples, c'est contribuer à faire rayonner les cultures autochtones et permettre aux Autochtones de reconnecter avec leur culture.

Our mission
Since 2013, the non-profit organization Kina8at (pronounced Kinawat) has been providing healing and cultural reappropriation to First Nations, as well as fostering reconciliation and sharing Aboriginal cultures with all, through Awareness and resourcing, inspired by the philosophy and traditions of First Nations. The goal is to help youth in particular, as it is important for Aboriginal youth to rediscover the philosophy of their ancestors.


 
Fund raising
The team and co-founders of Kina8at, Dominique Rankin, Hereditary Chief Algonquin and Marie-Josée Tardif, browse the roads of Quebec and internationally to transmit their teachings. Nomads, we have long had the dream of rooting ourselves on the anicinape territory and building a cultural and ecotourism center grouping our activities. We are almost there ! We have just bought a lot in La Conception, in the Laurentides region of Quebec. Located in a mature, mixed forest with access to water, this sustainable Aboriginal tourism center will be the only one of its kind in Eastern Canada. 
Our goal is to offer by 2020 a complete range of activities with a shelter, a reception pavilion, a cultural center and a teaching pavilion. We need your support to embody our vision as early as this winter of 2018. 
The objective of this campaign is to finance the purchase of equipment and quality materials to erect three prospector tents and thus quickly start the activities in the field. 
With your contribution, we will be able to buy:
- 3 canvases for prospectors' tents
- 3 floors (wood, insulation, screws, rope, etc.)
- 3 wood burning stoves
- furniture (bunk beds, chairs, tablets)
- firewood
 The more your support is consistent, the sooner we can receive you in the coming months on our new site. Once our objectives have been achieved, we will be able to build a more complete sanitary block with your additional contribution, acquire other prospector tents and benefit more quickly from technical assistance to start the construction of the permanent installations in 2019.
Your support is essential to the continuity of the achievement of our mission

<h2>Who we are</h2>
<p>We are <a href=""https://autolab.com.co/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Autolab</a>, a Colombian startup based in Bogota. We have dedicated the last two years building a technology platform for the auto repair industry with the mission of bringing more revenue and stability to small, independent auto repair shops and offering a high quality, affordable auto repair service to middle-class Colombians.</p>

<h2>How you can help us limit Covid-19 transmission in Colombia</h2>
<p>While our core business is shut down due to Colombia’s mandatory shelter-in-place policy, we have redirected our startup's financial and human capital toward a sterilization service for taxis and ride-hailing vehicles to help protect them, their families and their riders from constant exposure to Covid-19. We launched the service in one location and we are subsidizing it to the extent possible. We reduced the price from $5 to $2 and we launched a monthly subscription model that offers unlimited sterilizations for just $20. The driver can come for sterilizations as many times as he/she wants. We believe that we can have a huge impact on drivers and their passengers with this subscription model and by opening more locations. </p>
<p>Even with these price subsidies, <strong>most taxi and ride-hailing drivers do not have the ability to pay</strong>. Even something as little as $20 represents 10% of their income. <strong>We are asking for your help to fund 1,500 monthly subscriptions</strong>, which will protect thousands of vulnerable drivers, their families and their customers. 100% of your contributions will go towards subscription donations. You can join our initiative by sponsoring from 1 to 50 monthly subscriptions. As a thank you, we will share a documentary video with you demonstrating the reach and impact of your contribution.</p>
<h2>How do we protect drivers from the virus?</h2>
<p>Our sterilization protocol, which is being used in China to reduce contagion in public transportation vehicles, uses a combination of shortwave ultraviolet light exposure and a deep cleaning with isopropyl alcohol to achieve up to 99.9% sterilization.</p>
<p><strong>UVC</strong> is part of the UV light and consists of short, energetic wavelength of light. This is particularly good for destroying genetic material in humans and viral particles. UVC can thus <strong>destroy microorganisms</strong>. The WHO actually recommends to sterilize water with UVC by simply leaving the water in the sun for six hours. <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200327-can-you-kill-coronavirus-with-uv-light"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and food manufacturers</a> use UVC to sterilize equipment and products.</p>
<p>Even though there is no study about how UVC affects the Covid-19 specifically, there are studies that have shown that it can be used against very close relatives of the virus, such as Sars. <a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016609340400179X"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">One particular study</a> of the <strong>Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research</strong> in the USA, found that from all three types of UV light, UVC with the shortest wavelength of 200 to 280 nm, has the best chances of killing the virus by stopping it to reproduce itself. <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200327-can-you-kill-coronavirus-with-uv-light"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The radiation warps the structure of their genetic material and prevents the viral particles from making more copies of themselves.</a> When being exposed from a distance of 3 centimetres for 6 to 10 minutes, there was a 400-fold decrease in infectious virus. More interestingly, though, is that with an <strong>exposure of 15 minutes the virus stopped its reproduction completely</strong>!</p>
<p style=""text-align:center;""><a href=""https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016609340400179X"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588167755/umsdyenytdidehdjlrxq.png"" src="""" style=""width:50%;""/></a></p>
<p>UV light can cause cancer and destroy genetic material in humans. This is why we included a <strong>safety protocol in order to keep our staff and our clients save</strong>. We built boxes for cars which shields the rays from the outside world. Once the UV light is turned on, no one is allowed to go into that box until the UV light is turned off again.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1588109150/yce1xtki6d6zrdlv9qkj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h2>The situation in Colombia</h2>
<p>Covid-19 has changed all of our lives, most likely for a considerable time to come. For some of us, new standards such as social distancing and protective equipment are keeping us relatively safe. However, there is a large <strong>vulnerable population who continues to be exposed to the virus</strong>, including taxi drivers, cargo operators, healthcare workers, public transportation workers and delivery couriers. These people are the real heroes who are working behind the scenes to keep our cities running. <strong>Particularly in Colombia, these heroes are quite exposed because they lack the purchasing power needed to access effective protection</strong>. Without proper protection, these workers are putting themselves, their families and their clients at high risk of contracting Covid-19. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1586979951/rwl1xh2rychoilqoz2nf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>For a city of almost 10 million people, transportation solutions in Bogota are very limited.  The only mass transit solution is a BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) system called Transmilenio. This system has limited reach, so it is complemented with taxis and ride-hailing which make 300K+ trips per day. Moreover, the current avoidance of  mass transportation is leading to a higher reliance on taxis and ride-hailing vehicles. <strong>We estimate that in 300 trips, which is approximately a month’s work for an average taxi driver, there is an 80% chance of transporting someone with Covid-19</strong>. To add insult to injury, the average taxi driver earns $200-$300 per month, so paying for a proper sterilization service is impossible. Taxis and ride-hailing vehicles need an alternative solution.</p>
</div><div>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>How your donations will be used</h2>
<p>100% of your contributions will go towards donating sterilization subscriptions for taxi and ride-hailing drivers, which have a cost of $20 per month. This will allow the driver to come in and get a sterilization as many times as they want for a month. Here is a breakdown of the subscription cost:</p>
<ul>
<li>Labor: 61%</li>
<li>Materials: 29%</li>
<li>Rent: 9%</li>
</ul>

While our core business is shut down due to Colombia’s mandatory shelter-in-place policy, we have redirected our startup's financial and human capital toward a sterilization service for taxis and ride-hailing vehicles to help protect them, their families and their riders from constant exposure to Covid-19. We launched the service in one location and we are subsidizing it to the extent possible. We reduced the price from $5 to $2 and we launched a monthly subscription model that offers unlimited sterilizations for just $20. The driver can come for sterilizations as many times as he/she wants. We believe that we can have a huge impact on drivers and their passengers with this subscription model and by opening more locations. 
Even with these price subsidies, most taxi and ride-hailing drivers do not have the ability to pay. Even something as little as $20 represents 10% of their income. We are asking for your help to fund 1,500 monthly subscriptions, which will protect thousands of vulnerable drivers, their families and their customers. 100% of your contributions will go towards subscription donations. You can join our initiative by sponsoring from 1 to 50 monthly subscriptions. As a thank you, we will share a documentary video with you demonstrating the reach and impact of your contribution.
How do we protect drivers from the virus?
Our sterilization protocol, which is being used in China to reduce contagion in public transportation vehicles, uses a combination of shortwave ultraviolet light exposure and a deep cleaning with isopropyl alcohol to achieve up to 99.9% sterilization.
UVC is part of the UV light and consists of short, energetic wavelength of light. This is particularly good for destroying genetic material in humans and viral particles. UVC can thus destroy microorganisms. The WHO actually recommends to sterilize water with UVC by simply leaving the water in the sun for six hours. Hospitals, pharmaceutical companies and food manufacturers use UVC to sterilize equipment and products.
Even though there is no study about how UVC affects the Covid-19 specifically, there are studies that have shown that it can be used against very close relatives of the virus, such as Sars. One particular study of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research in the USA, found that from all three types of UV light, UVC with the shortest wavelength of 200 to 280 nm, has the best chances of killing the virus by stopping it to reproduce itself. The radiation warps the structure of their genetic material and prevents the viral particles from making more copies of themselves. When being exposed from a distance of 3 centimetres for 6 to 10 minutes, there was a 400-fold decrease in infectious virus. More interestingly, though, is that with an exposure of 15 minutes the virus stopped its reproduction completely!

UV light can cause cancer and destroy genetic material in humans. This is why we included a safety protocol in order to keep our staff and our clients save. We built boxes for cars which shields the rays from the outside world. Once the UV light is turned on, no one is allowed to go into that box until the UV light is turned off again.


 
The situation in Colombia
Covid-19 has changed all of our lives, most likely for a considerable time to come. For some of us, new standards such as social distancing and protective equipment are keeping us relatively safe. However, there is a large vulnerable population who continues to be exposed to the virus, including taxi drivers, cargo operators, healthcare workers, public transportation workers and delivery couriers. These people are the real heroes who are working behind the scenes to keep our cities running. Particularly in Colombia, these heroes are quite exposed because they lack the purchasing power needed to access effective protection. Without proper protection, these workers are putting themselves, their families and their clients at high risk of contracting Covid-19. 

For a city of almost 10 million people, transportation solutions in Bogota are very limited.  The only mass transit solution is a BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) system called Transmilenio. This system has limited reach, so it is complemented with taxis and ride-hailing which make 300K+ trips per day. Moreover, the current avoidance of  mass transportation is leading to a higher reliance on taxis and ride-hailing vehicles. We estimate that in 300 trips, which is approximately a month’s work for an average taxi driver, there is an 80% chance of transporting someone with Covid-19. To add insult to injury, the average taxi driver earns $200-$300 per month, so paying for a proper sterilization service is impossible. Taxis and ride-hailing vehicles need an alternative solution.

 
How your donations will be used
100% of your contributions will go towards donating sterilization subscriptions for taxi and ride-hailing drivers, which have a cost of $20 per month. This will allow the driver to come in and get a sterilization as many times as they want for a month. Here is a breakdown of the subscription cost:

Labor: 61%
Materials: 29%
Rent: 9%

Currently we are planning on a location in Vallejo, California (home to Six Flags Discovery Kingdom, Napa Valley and gateway to San Francisco and Silicon Valley). This is where we will set up the exhibits, perform the upgrades and open to the public. If successful we may continue at this location into 2021. We are also considering locations in Branson, Missouri (The premier Mid West tourist destination with over 10 million visitors per year), Nashville,  and Las Vegas. TimelineWith the complete funding from all sources, we begin the installation at the Vallejo, California location in September 2020 and open the doors in October 2020 in time for the Halloween Season.  Supporting the CommunityWe are working with other UFO organizations such as Roswell International Data and Research Center, MUFON, the International UFO Congress, The History Channel and the SY-FY Channel making the museum a touch stone for the ever expanding UFO sub culture. Encounters UFO Xperience Museum will be a welcome gathering place for all those who explore, study and believe in alien encounters. Continued GrowthAs the museum grows, we look to open satellite Encounters UFO Xperience installations in new locations.

<h3>""Let food unite, empower, grow, and celebrate our local community""</h3>
<p>The inspiration for the GastroPark has always been rooted in creating a community gathering place that thrives while featuring and supporting other local small businesses.  Food has been a powerful unifier throughout history, and we believe it to be the best way to bring people together. The GastroPark is a celebration of food, art, and culture which is fueled by the local entrepreneurial spirit.</p>
<h3>What is GastroPark and why it's needed?</h3>
<p>GastroPark is a well curated food experience for guests featuring an innovative approach that will deliver delicious mobile food concepts from local small business owners.   </p>
<p>Concepts like GastroPark currently exist within the “experiential dining” category and this segment is growing quickly across the country. These concepts allow entrepreneurs and small businesses the opportunity to test, launch, or scale a business in a way that is fiscally responsible and does not require someone to mortgage their future as they pursue their food business dreams.</p>
<p>The GastroPark will be a valuable venue for new and existing food trucks as well as other concepts.  We aim to provide both a launching pad for a new business as well as a proving ground for existing brick-and-mortar restaurants looking to expand their reach and revenue.</p>
<p>COVID-19 may have changed the landscape of how we “gather” at this time, but we believe our concept is positioned to thrive during these restrictive circumstances.  GastroPark has plenty of outdoor seating, streamlined staffing (that protects guests and staff), smart design, and will use cooperative strategies to mitigate overhead expenses.  These factors help create an adaptive environment for the current market needs; while allowing the business, and its local vendor partners, to operate efficiently and safely during difficult economic times.</p>
<h3>Our story so far...</h3>
<p>We approached the Town of West Hartford way back in the summer of 2016 regarding zoning changes that would allow food trucks and food truck parks. In 2017, zoning was passed for the Industrial District of West Hartford and later that year we purchased an old auto-body shop off New Park Avenue. Throughout 2018 we worked with our architect, engineer, and contractor to redesign the property, creating a unique indoor/outdoor venue unlike anything in Connecticut.  In the fall of 2019, following a public hearing, our special use permit application was approved.  This permit gave us the green light to apply for construction permits.</p>
<p>            Over the past year the property has undergone significant improvements; including tie-ins to the storm and sewer systems, a 15 foot retaining wall to relocate the parking from the front to the rear of our facility to comply with zoning regulations as well as significant site work to redesign the outdoor dining and driving areas.</p>
<p>            Throughout the process we have navigated several delays and zoning hurdles.  Recent economic and financial challenges associated with COVID-19 have only reinforced our belief that the GastroPark concept will be reliable, helpful, even important to empower and provide small and start-up businesses a safe platform during pandemic life.  </p>
<h3>We need your help!</h3>
<p>Our team (and friends, family, and believers) has invested an extensive amount of time and resources to bring this project to life. We are almost there, but access to necessary capital from traditional lenders isn’t.  Banks are currently not as likely to lend to start-ups during the pandemic.  We still need funds and are asking for your help to finish the buildout of the outdoor dining area and our indoor restrooms.   With your help the GastroPark will become a reality.</p>
<p>In exchange for your support, we are offering a number of perks that will provide a number of experiences and benefits to supporters looking for exclusive GastroPark opportunities. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact you will make</h3>
<p>By supporting GastroPark, you are not only empowering one business, you are helping create a platform that will provide community value. A platform that will encourage economic growth to a network of other small local businesses.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why now?</h3>
<p>Let’s face it. The world isn’t easy for small businesses. This is even more true for restaurants and food related concepts. As profit margins shrink and expenses grow, entrepreneurs are constantly thrown new challenges.  Product overhead, payroll, rent hikes, and now COVID-19 are all serious factors in a business' success.  </p>
<p>Let’s do a quick review of what makes GastroPark so well designed to operate during the most challenging economic circumstances all while providing a platform of success for other small businesses:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Outdoor dining</strong>: Over 50% of seating is outside with plenty of room for social distancing.</li>
<li>
<strong>Value</strong>: Food trucks are an affordable and delicious dining option.</li>
<li>
<strong>Low overhead</strong>: Our food truck and vendor partnerships enable us to reduce volatile areas of overhead while empowering small business growth.</li>
<li>
<strong>Streamlined staffing</strong>: We will be able to deliver exceptional experience while reducing potential for hands on contamination.</li>
<li>
<strong>Opportunity</strong>: Our curated and rotating food truck lineup will provide vending and employment opportunity to many small businesses.</li>
<li>
<strong>Variety</strong>: A constantly rotating line-up of food options means something for everyone and you don't need to compromise on what your family eats for dinner.</li>
<li>
<strong>Empowerment</strong>: More people will be able to pursue their small business dreams without the reliance on costly loans, long-term leases and other fiscal variables that stifle creativity and economic growth. </li>

</div></div>","IL NOSTRO PROGETTO - OUR PROJECTCOS'E' ""BUY WHAT YOU WANT PAYING WHAT YOU HAVE?"" - E la parte Social?WHAT IS ""BUY WHAT YOU WANT PAYING WHAT YOU HAVE?"" And why Social ?


Il Nostro Progetto di sito web nasce
dopo opportune ricerche di mercato che dimostrano quanto il consumismo sia
entrato prepotentemente nelle nostre vite. La ""necessità"" di
possedere beni di alto budget anche quando le nostre finanze non ce lo
permettono. Sogniamo di possedere l'ultimo modello di qualsiasi cosa,
esponendoci a grossi sacrifici economici e privandoci, talvolta, di cose di cui
abbiamo bisogno sul serio. Fino ad indebitarci pur di APPARIRE.
Our
website project was born after market research that has shown  how consumerism has become a strong
part of our lives. The ""need"" to own  high budget products even if our finances do not allow it.
We dream of owning the latest model of anything, exposing  large economic sacrifices and depriving
us sometimes of what we really need until we fall into debt.
Proprio per questo
motivo sono nati e continueranno a nascere come funghi siti che promettono
l’acquisto di un bene di lusso a prezzi stracciati sfruttando meccanismi
talvolta poco chiari e poco onesti. Parliamo, delle aste al ribasso e delle
aste al centesimo, tanto per fare due esempi. 
Precisely for this
reason, websites were created that continue to grow like mushrooms, sites that
promise the purchase of ""luxury at bargain prices"" by exploiting
sometimes in unclear and dishonest ways, specifically, the Dutch auction and
penny auctions, just to cite two examples.
Con il nostro progetto
ci proponiamo di abbattere considerevolmente i costi di un prodotto, fino al
60-70 %, senza utilizzare alcun metodo truffaldino ma soltanto permettendoci di
spendere ciò che realmente possediamo, non un euro di più, senza però
rinunciare al meglio.With our project, we aim to bring down
the cost of a product considerably, up to 60-70%, without using fraudulent
methods but at the same time, allowing you to spend what you really have, and
not a euro more, without giving up quality.Noi non alimentiamo
false leggende. Con questo progetto non vi promettiamo l’acquisto di un IPHONE
(giusto per citare un prodotto in “voga”) a 1-2 € ma semplicemente vi diciamo
che potrete acquistarlo spendendo quanto ritenete giusto senza spendere non un
euro in più, non un euro in meno.We don't tell tall
tales. With this project we promise not only that you can buy an iPhone at 1-2
€ (just to mention one of our hot items) but simply to tell you that you can
buy it by spending what you feel is right without spending a euro more, or a
euro less.
Andreste in un centro
commerciale se sapeste che, quel giorno, a quella determinata ora, tutti i
prodotti di consumo saranno scontati del 60%? Sareste disposti a pagare il
nuovo modello del vostro cellulare, gioco, tv preferito la metà o anche meno
del suo prezzo senza incorrere in metodi truffaldini e senza “tentare la sorte”
spendendo più di quanto programmato per rimanere con un pugno di mosche in
mano? In che modo abbasseremo i prezzi così tanto? Il sistema sfrutterà dei semplici meccanismi che permetteranno un calo drastico del prezzo grazie all'utenza generata dal sito. Inoltre abbiamo preso accordi con alcuni importanti fornitori al livello mondiale. Se date un'occhiata al nostro e-commerce su ebay (attualmente in vacanza) con il nick taba.croci (http://feedback.ebay.it/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFe...) potrete sicuramente notare dai feedback che già i nostri prezzi sono i più bassi sul mercato italiano. Meno ricarico per noi certo, ma più gente soddisfatta. Dubbi sul meccanismo del sito? Contattateci via mail. Vi daremo tutte le risposte che desiderate. easyseller.society@gmail.comWould you go to a mall
if you knew that on a specific day, at a particular time, all consumer products
would be discounted by 60%? Would you buy the new model of your mobile phone,
game or tv for half the price, or less, without risk, or spending more than you
planned to, only to have nothing, or less than what you wanted?In which way will we lower price? Our system will exploit some mechanisms that will allow a drastic drop in the price. And we have agreements with some most important suppliers in the world. See our e-commerce on ebay : taba.croci (now in vacation) (http://feedback.ebay.it/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewFe...). We have the lowest price in Italy. Less money for us but more people happy. Do you want more informations on our websites? Send us an email at easyseller.society@gmail.com
Ma la parte social? Avete mai acquistato un oggetto dal web o dal vostro store sotto casa ma non ci avete capito nulla sul funzionamento o sul montaggio? Come noi avete perso ore a girare su internet cercando la soluzione sperata. Noi racchiudiamo tutto in un solo web site che è capace di interagire con le più grandi realtà di social network esistenti e con alcuni dei siti e-commerce più famosi a livello globale. Ogni nostro acquisto potrà essere registrato nella nostra piattaforma con la possibilità di condividerlo o meno. Accedendo alla nostra piattaforma l'utente avrà la possibilità di visionare chi possiede un modello simile o uguale e mettersi in contatto direttamente con il possessore chiedendo spiegazioni su questo o quel problema. Confrontare i prezzi del web o acquistare direttamente dai venditori presenti sulla piattaforma. Ogni utente potrà inserire delle guide o manuali sull'oggetto appena acquistato, oppure rispondere alle perplessità degli altri. Oppure consigliarne o meno l'acquisto. Tutto in una sola piattaforma. Dalla ps4, al trapano, dall'auto al frigorifero. Ci si aiuta reciprocamente e ciò darà ancora ulteriori vantaggi e/o risparmi sul nostro sito. Arrivando a risparmiare ancora di più, in quanto gli utenti attivi avranno accesso ad ulteriori sconti sulla merce in offerta. Un social network degli oggetti! In poche parole:Vuoi acquistare un oggetto ma non sei sicuro? --> Vieni sulla nostra piattaforma --> verifichi chi lo possiede --> Ti metti in contatto con lui o ne valuti la soddisfazione o lo compri dai venditori consigliatiHai un problema con un oggetto? --> Vieni sulla nostra piattaforma --> verifichi chi lo possiede --> cerchi le guide o manuali --> ti metti in contatto con chi lo possiede o posti la tua domanda --> i possessori ti illumineranno a riguardo 




Why Social? Have you ever bought an item in Internet or in a store near your house but you didn't know in which way you can mount or adjust it? Or if was it a good item?In Internet you don't know where can you search for these informations? You can find all that you want in our web site that interacts with the most important social network in the world like facebook or the most important e-commerce sites like Amazon or Ebay. If you want you can share your purchase. One database with million objects. A user can see if someone have that item and post his question or he can speaks directly with owners. Not a people social network but an item social network. Every users can insert manuals or answer questions on that item and recommend or not the purchase of it. And you can buy an item from sellers or you can comparate prices on web. You can find a page for every items with its owners also.If you'll help something you'll have other benefits or save on our web site. 

In two words: Do you want to buy a particular object? --> get access to our platform -->check out who owns it searching for item--> Contact owners and make your questions or buy it from sellersHave you a problem with a particular object? --> get access to our platform --> check out who owns it searching for item--> see manuals or contact directly owners 



Non abbiamo la pretesa
di rivoluzionare il mondo dell’e-commerce. Ma vogliamo provarci. Per questo
abbiamo bisogno di voi!

We are not saying that
we will revolutionize the world of e-commerce, but we want to try. For this we
need you!

IL VOSTRO CONTRIBUTO E' ESSENZIALE - YOUR CONTRIBUTION IS ESSENTIAL



Siete una parte
indispensabile del progetto. I vostri contributi renderanno possibile la nostra
idea. Tutti i soldi raccolti saranno destinati esclusivamente alla produzione
di questo innovativo web-site. 
You are an indispensable part of our project.
Your contributions will make our idea possible and all monies raised will be
used exclusively for the production of this innovative web-site. 
Noi,
elencheremo, giorno dopo giorno, tutte le spese effettuate per la realizzazione
del progetto. 
We will list, day after day, all costs incurred for the project 
Per chiarezza, però, vogliamo riassumervi a cosa serviranno i vostri
contributi: ・ Pagamento
stipendi nuovi programmatori scelti esclusivamente fra chi, in questo periodo
di crisi, è senza occupazione. Non cerchiamo gente già impiegata ma persone con
tanta voglia di lavorare e che, per un motivo o per l’altro, si trovano in
condizioni economiche difficili; 


 ・ Acquisto di server su cui far girare il sito; 


・ Marketing. Senza utenti il nostro progetto morirebbe
prima di cominciare, quindi abbiamo bisogno di lanciare una campagna
pubblicitaria importante che indirizzi l’utenza sul nostro sito permettendo
anche ai più scettici di fidarsi di noi  


 ・ Spese per manutenzione e progettazione 



For clarity, however, we want to summarize what your contributions
will be used for: ・
Paying the salaries of new programmers chosen exclusively among those who, in
this time of crisis, are unemployed. We are not searching for those who are
already employed, but people with a great desire to work and who, for one reason
or another, are in economic difficulty ・
Purchase of servers to run the site ・
Marketing. Without clients, our project would die before it even began, so we
need to launch a major advertising campaign that encourages the clients on our
site, even the most skeptical, to have trust in us. ・
Expenses for maintenance and design    

POSSO CONTRIBUIRE MA COSA CI RICAVO? - I CAN HELP BUT WHAT WILL I RECEIVE IN RETURN?

Tutti coloro che
effettueranno una donazione avranno in cambio qualcosa. Tutte le “ricompense”
sono descritte nella parte Perks. 
All those who make a donation will get
something in return. All the ""rewards"" are described in the “Perks”
section.
CONDIVIDI LA CAMPAGNA - SHARE CAMPAIGN

campagna. Quindi aiutateci, condividete e rendete visibile questo progetto. Contiamo su di voi ed incrociamo le dita.

Non pretendiamo che il nostro sogno si
realizzi, ma ora siamo arenati. Non possiamo più permetterci altre spese.
Contiamo su di voi ed incrociamo le dita. Solo chi ci crede può cambiare
davvero il mondo! Noi ci crediamo, e voi?
We do not claim that our dream has come
true yet, but now we are stranded. We can not afford other expenses. We are
counting on your help and we are keeping our fingers crossed. Only those who
believe can really change the world! We believe, and you?",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h1><b>The Problem</b></h1>Currently, deaf and hard of hearing students that require
interpreters are forced to constantly cycle through different interpreters that
do not have the skills or the right fit to clearly communicate what is going on
in their classes. Often, interpreters will be too slow, too fast, or won’t phrase
the student’s questions correctly. In some schools, you can request a different
interpreter, however you still have to pick blindly from a variety, often
leading to more trouble with misunderstanding. This constant cycle leads to the
student falling behind in class and often becoming frustrated with their
education altogether. <br/><br/>None of this means interpreters are bad at what they do, in fact Interpreters help the Deaf and HOH community in many ways. It is only that there are many ways to interpret, and sometimes it is not always the best fit for the individual student.<h1><b>Our Solution</b></h1>
<p>Grade
My Terp looks to solve this pressing issue by providing a web interface where
students post their own reviews for the interpreters they work with, which then
other students can look over and make decisions based on those reviews. The
reviews are set up on certain metrics, along with a short written option.
Opposing metrics do not necessarily mean an interpreter is performing poorly,
it just allows students to find the right fit for them. For example, some
students may want an interpreter who signs fast, while others may like it
slower. Using this process, students can insure they request an interpreter
that will help them best understand their education. <br/><br/></p>

Just as important I will need help networking with the tech community in Silicon Valley. I plan on joining business groups in the area, and use social web sites. If you know of anyone in the Bay Area of California that are interested in helping me please make the connection. Money isn't everything, I really need the good of people to make my journey a success. 


I recently visited the Bay Area and it is beautiful. I went with my father to search for apartments/rooms for rent, and to promote this campaign. We had a great time. I am very ambitious to move.

     





Goal

 I plan on spending the next three years  Developing FinditCity Designing a marketing campaign to reach users globally 
Living in the lab Building a corporate administrative structure, Budgeting/Accounting,Sales and Customer Support
Guaranteeing the public an extraordinary product that will be useful and fun. 
I have a plan and until I find a team of people that want to achieve these goals, I will maintain a job and continue my Venture search. I will never quit being ambitious and I hope to find an investor that loves my vision for tech products and will work with me completely to market innovative products. 








Thank you :)

<br/><h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Hello! I'm Jillian Schiavi, the hand lettering and illustration artist behind <a href=""www.jillyink.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">jilly ink</a>. On a snowy tundra-like day in Chicago, I opened the jilly ink <a href=""www.jillyink.etsy.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Etsy shop</a> with a few hand lettered items, rubber stamps, and some lettering services. Now, three years later, I've leant my work to the wedding industry, hand lettering invitations, envelopes, day-of paper products, and signs. I've also illustrated for editorial publications, custom commissioned pieces, tattoo designs, and retail merchandise. Recently I was featured on the <a href=""https://instagram.com/marthastewart/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Martha Stewart Instagram</a> feed, and I'm excited for some more avenue through which to share my work with the world!</p>
<p>Up until now, I've been running my business through information I've pulled together from a myriad of resources - online, in books, through the advice of other creative entrepreneurs, etc. Currently I also support myself through teaching yoga, and as an Independent Consultant with Arbonne. My aim is to build <a href=""www.jillyink.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">jilly ink </a>into a fully functional and self-sustaining creative business, and to prove to myself, as well as other creative entrepreneurs, that the starving artist mentality doesn't have to be true. </p>
<p>This is where you come in. After doing a lot of research on various methods to up my game in the online marketing world, and harness the power of having an online component to my business, I've chosen two tried and true methods to focus on to bring jilly ink to the next level. I have so much respect for both <a href=""www.marieforleo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Marie Forleo</a> and <a href=""www.iwillteachyoutoberich.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ramit Sethi</a>, and both of these marketing gurus offer amazing online courses specifically geared towards entrepreneurs with online businesses. <a href=""www.joinbschool.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Marie Forleo's B School</a> is currently in the enrollment period, so this would be the next opportunity for me to plug in, use the skills I learn, and take my business beyond where it currently resides. </p>
<p>What you'll be helping me with is not only the knowledge and tangible resources I'll use to further validate and advance jilly ink, but you'll also be helping me live my dream of being a working artist that can still enjoy the benefits of having a stable, strong financial foundation. This is the number one reason why so many creatives quit on their goals and their dreams, and I believe, with your help and my determination, I'll rock the <a href=""www.joinbschool.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">B School</a> curriculum and prove that owning and operating a thriving artistic career can bring beauty and inspiration to others to do the same. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">You will be helping me with the B School tuition of $2,000 - a steal if you think of what one course in an MBA program costs.

But I also believe that when a creative business thrives, that energy drives other creatives to build their dreams bigger.

My father, MTV Music video director, Aswad Ayinde, started molesting me when I was 8 years old.

Myself and members of my team will personally hand deliver these care bags, and when we post pictures of us preparing them for delivery, you will see exactly where your contribution went. 

    Other Ways You Can Help 
Benjamin Franklin said that ""justice will be served when those who are unaffected are just as outraged as those who are affected"". Well I say, we are all affected; which is why you should help. Any contribution you can make either financially or by sharing this campaign on your social networking sites and encourage your family, friends and coworkers to contribute, will go towards the improvement of our community and the uplifting of our women and children.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>And how do we decide who gets to go first <br/></b></h3>

<p>Of course there are plenty of places to rename on this great planet
of ours, so no one misses out. But, if you want <b>The

you'll probably have to come up with a bit more than two bucks. </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">But, wait! What if your bank account is not busting at the
seams! <br/>
</h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Well...we did think about that! </h3>
<p>Just get your family and friends to participate and their
contribution counts not only to their account, but yours, too! But only in terms of where you ""stand"" in line. The perks are based on your personal contribution. But it's the collective that will make this project a success! <br/></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">So you ask...</h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> ""What’s going to happen with all these dollars,

<p>We’re going to start a bank! Actually, that's the second step. The first step is promoting a diverse set of high-profit, sustainable businesses and socialpreneurial projects which will provide the much larger amount of capital needed to start the bank. A bank whose profits will be
used to invest in an unlimited number of businesses, programs and people who are not only making the
world a better place for all of us, but doing it in a way that can be self-sustainable.
In other words, making the world a better place without the need for charity. </p>
<p>Not that there is anything wrong with asking for financial
support, but as folks who know, there is a whole lot of need and not enough
foundation, grant and scholarship money to go around. So, if <b>The Clean Bank </b>(which will provide GREAT financial services to
folks like you) and other great entrepreneurs and socialpreneurs can create
self-sustaining programs that don’t need those grant dollars, then that
leaves those limited financial resources for those programs that REALLY need it!</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As you can imagine, The Clean Bank Project is neither an industry-
nor time- or geographically-restricted venture. Due to the diversity and depth of
our professional backgrounds, the inclusiveness and diversity of our ever-growing network and our practical and sustainable business paradigm, not only do we
anticipate continued engagement with our supporters, we plan on transforming this
crowd-funding phase into a mutually-beneficial consortium of profitable partnerships and
collaborations. </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Here’s a few of the national bank-founding projects we

I paid cash for the 5 acre land which was barren- no trees, no buildings, no power, no utilities and no topsoil. I knew it was going to take a lot of time, money and energy to build a farm from the ground up. I like a good challenge though, so I got to work!In February 2013, my work on the farm began. I dug a well, started to build a farm office and planted a bunch of fruit trees. Unfortunately, a lot of these trees died during the first rainy season due to flooding and standing water. Then I planted a bunch more fruit trees. And again a lot of them died at the first light winter frost.The first 2 years on the farm ended up being mostly experimenting on what works and learning what it takes to grow plants on this land. Once I had this figured out and was able to harvest my first banana bunch, I had a plan.

</div></div>","Your donation will help finance a Firefly Charger business in an impoverished Ugandan village!


Ruth (not in the video above) will be our first Firefly Charger businesswoman!  She lives in the Sparrow Home of Hope at Divine Holistic Ministries in Buetma, Uganda.  She is a widow, has three children (all in school), and loves God in a big way.  We don't have a good picture of Ruth yet, but we will supply one later in a campaign update.
Ruth represents everything we're trying to do here.  Let's
help her start her own Njeru lighting business!
Please note that the proceeds of this campaign will not go directly to Ruth, but will be used by Green Buck Labs (see ""Who are we?"" below) to pay for her Firefly Charger, shipping, and associated expenses.


Once we have this first business in place, we will have a repeatable process that we can use to launch on a global scale.  You will be helping entrepreneurs to become self-sufficient while lighting their own communities.  Our goal to help impoverished communities help themselves.

What's the BIG global problem?



About 1/5th of the world's population is still in the dark and more or less in a permanent electrical blackout.  Our answer to the problem is the Firefly Charger. 



Source:  International Energy Agency




What is a Firefly Charger?
A Firefly Charger is a portable kit containing all of the components needed to provide simple lighting for up to 20 homes at a time.  Each kit will include bright LED light strings, rechargeable batteries, and solar battery chargers. 













Are Firefly Chargers different than other lighting solutions?

Unlike other types of solar lighting, the Firefly Charger is a business in a box for local entrepreneurs in developing communities to profit from.  We will be helping these communities to help themselves.




       

The local entrepreneurs will lend light strings to residents and recharge their batteries for a fee.  Each market would determine its own price for the service depending upon what its residents could afford to pay -- just like any other business.

How will local entrepreneurs afford to buy Firefly Chargers?

Most of the local entrepreneurs we are talking about will not have the money to purchase Firefly Charger kits.  Initially, we will use the proceeds from this campaign to finance the kits for them.  The entrepreneurs will pay back these loans from the revenue they receive.  Then we will use the re-paid loans to make loans for additional kits -- and so on, and so forth.




Eventually, will be using an online micro-lending platform like Kiva.org to help them in finance the purchase of kits.  Kiva.org is a social lending site which allows people to loan as little as $25 to help people in developing communities to start businesses (and to do other things).





What is our goal for this campaign?
The goal of this campaign is to get the first such lighting rental service running!  Once we have this first business in place, we will have a system that we can repeat with other local entrepreneurs again and again.






Who are we?


Brian Martin is the inventor of the patent pending Firefly Charger.  He has spent a majority of his savings and spare time developing it over the last five years.  During this time, he pulled in 18 friends who have more money, contacts and resources than him.  This team is now organized as Green Buck Labs, Inc. (www.fireflycharger.com).


 



For most of those years, this was actually a wind energy project.  Since Brian and his wife live at a church, the congregation has gotten to witness (and often laugh at) eight unique prototypes whipping in the wind.  However, the project took a 180 degree turn one day when the latest wind turbine prototype was nearing completion.  The missionary on the team said that where this thing was going (i.e. equatorial countries), there was plenty of sun not much wind.  Not long after that, the Firefly Charger was born.


CFO Todd Dangel and Brian Martin
Green Buck Labs is a for-profit, Ohio ""C"" Corporation.  It is a social enterprise structured to develop and deliver humanitarian products as quickly as possible to those who need them most.

          

What's in a Firefly Charger?
The Firefly Charger is a portable kit containing all of the components needed to light up to 20 homes (or rooms).  It contains:
2 solar battery chargers (charges AA, AAA, C, D, 9V)
20 bright LED light strings w/ 20 LEDs each
Enough rechargeable batteries to run 20 light strings (approx. 1 week between charges)
1 Battery charge tester
Containers for sorting batteries
Transparent Lid - Leave the entire kit outside to charge the batteries



How far along are we?
Since the original Firefly Charger ""napkin sketch"", we have done the following:


Produced production-quality prototypes


Our team's own missionary is currently testing a prototype in a dark community (Uganda - Africa)


Received U.S. Patent Pending status


Made deals with some component suppliers for wholesale discounts 



       

What all can a Firefly Charger be used for?


Developing Countries

Battery & light string exchange businesses run by entrepreneurs 
Battery & light string exchanges run by churches/missions

Everyone Else

Emergency backup lighting during blackouts and disasters


What do we need your help with?

We're looking to raise enough money from donors like you in order to get the first lighting business started overseas.
This will involve:


Finding several entrepreneur candidates (probably in Uganda - Africa)
Manufacturing a Firefly Charger kit
Lending money to the leading entrepreneur candidate
Sending the Firefly Charger to the entrepreneur -- this will be the biggest expense
Helping them to get going by offering help online when available or through local helpers



What will you get in return?


 
*** See the ""Perks"" to find out what you'll receive for donating different amounts.

Components included in the Perks like light strings, chargers, and rechargeable batteries are the same components that will be sent to entrepreneurs overseas.




Also, all of the physical Perks are listed as ""U. S. only"" because of high international shipping costs.   We wanted to be sure that a majority of your donation goes towards funding the project goal instead of the perk. 

Physical perks like light strings or firefly jars will be delivered shortly after the campaign has closed and the project funds are withdrawn.
  

What will be the impact from this effort?

On a personal level, we will be helping an impoverished entrepreneur in a developing country to become self-sufficient.  We will also be helping to light dark homes.
On a societal level, we will be helping to ""Light the World"" and boost ultra-poor regions economically. 
Pretty cool stuff!

</div> <p>Kahenas is a <b>community of artists, artisans, and designers from Morocco</b>. It is the <b>first e-commerce platform for contemporary Moroccan culture</b>. </p>
<p>We launched a few months ago with the hope of representing this new wave of extremely talented voices that have something <b>inspiring</b> to offer and a <b>progressive</b> message to send from the Arab World. Every single artist we approached has agreed to be a part of this adventure, <b>from powerhouse Hassan Hajjaj to young, emerging artists</b>. We were also very touched to see that our customers hail from around the world, from Shanghai to NYC, and from Dakar to Lugano. In total, we <b>now represent 25 artists &amp; brands, carry over 300 products, and have shipped to more than 15 countries</b>. </p>
<p>BUT, for an e-commerce so centered around the community, we felt like something was missing. And that 'something' was an offline interaction with our public. We decided to start organizing and participating in offline events, first hosting a brunch at Fellah Hotel in Marrakech, and then traveling to (one of) Paris' temple of cool, La Gaite Lyrique, for a pop up shop. </p>
<p>So, <b>after Marrakech and Paris</b>, we would like the next stop on Kahenas' Pop Up Tour to be NYC, capital of contemporary culture, where we hope to organize:</p> <ul> <li>
<b>Meet &amp; Greet</b> with some of our artists.</li> <li>A <b>5-day Pop Up Shop</b>.</li> <li>Launch of <b>2 Limited Edition surprise products</b>!</li> </ul> <p></p>

<h3>Our 3-Point Plan (Where your money goes)</h3>
<div>We need $35k USD, which can be broken down into three as shown on the visual above:</div> <ul> <li>The <b>first $15k</b> USD will go to <b>organizing the Pop Up Shop in NYC</b> and all associated costs including transport of goods, renting the space, preparing the space &amp; inviting the artists for a very funky meet &amp; greet. </li>

OUR DOCUMENTARY
We will release one chapter for every week of this crowdfunding campaign! :) ENJOY!

CHAPTER 1/5: Insight in Moroccan Contemporary Culture





CHAPTER 2/5: The Artists
Chapter 3/5: The Challenges





Chapter 4/5: The Community



Chapter 5/5: The Future


WHO WE ARE
 Kahenas is a community of artists, artisans, and designers from Morocco. It is the first e-commerce platform for contemporary Moroccan culture. 
We launched a few months ago with the hope of representing this new wave of extremely talented voices that have something inspiring to offer and a progressive message to send from the Arab World. Every single artist we approached has agreed to be a part of this adventure, from powerhouse Hassan Hajjaj to young, emerging artists. We were also very touched to see that our customers hail from around the world, from Shanghai to NYC, and from Dakar to Lugano. In total, we now represent 25 artists & brands, carry over 300 products, and have shipped to more than 15 countries. 
BUT, for an e-commerce so centered around the community, we felt like something was missing. And that 'something' was an offline interaction with our public. We decided to start organizing and participating in offline events, first hosting a brunch at Fellah Hotel in Marrakech, and then traveling to (one of) Paris' temple of cool, La Gaite Lyrique, for a pop up shop. 
So, after Marrakech and Paris, we would like the next stop on Kahenas' Pop Up Tour to be NYC, capital of contemporary culture, where we hope to organize:  
Meet & Greet with some of our artists. A 5-day Pop Up Shop. Launch of 2 Limited Edition surprise products!  
WHO WE ARE IN A 2 MIN VIDEO REEL



   
TAKE KAHENAS TO NYC!




Our 3-Point Plan (Where your money goes)
We need $35k USD, which can be broken down into three as shown on the visual above:  The first $15k USD will go to organizing the Pop Up Shop in NYC and all associated costs including transport of goods, renting the space, preparing the space & inviting the artists for a very funky meet & greet. 
The next $10k USD will go to the design and production of two exclusive products for the Pop Up Shop. The first one from rockstar fashion designer Amine Bendriouich, and the second one from beauty queen (and equally talented) Sofia El Arabi!
The final $10k will allow us to begin our long-awaited effort to start branching out of Morocco in into the rest of Africa and the Middle East. We hope to eventually cover the Middle East and Africa, and bring you the most inspiring creative minds from this region.  
If we don't reach our first goal of $15k USD, we will look for sponsors or institutional partners to complete the difference and ONLY use the money once we reach $15K USD!
    KAHENAS' IMPACT

In a world so divided and full of selective communication, we want to offer a refreshing voice of hope and emphasize a community that continues to create and be inspired. Starting in Morocco, but with the ambition to find, meet, and invite artists from other African and Arab countries to join as soon as we can. Supporting Kahenas is supporting a narrative of unity, diversity, and creativity from all regions of the world. It's saying that stigmatization and stereotyping are wrong always, and that it is by focusing on the commonalities rather than the differences that we can move forward together. 




THE TEAM
We are based in Casablanca, Morocco, more precisely in the industrial neighborhood of Ain Sebaa! 


ARTISTS AND BLOGGERS: The essence of Kahenas, the ones that make this community possible and for which we have created this platform.
SAKI: The all-powerful GM, Saki, raised in Bruxelles, joined the team in July 2014, and since then, has pushed us hard to make this happen. Her leadership has allowed us to pivot, and her will to succeed is only matched by her passion for Morocco's creative minds.
CHAFS: The founder, the creative spirit and the link that brought together the different talents Morocco has to offer. Chafs' determination to bring Kahenas to life created a solid community of people that share his vision and who contribute to keep the concept growing.
BLEND: Our consultants, the ones who listen to us and turn our ideas into beautiful visuals. We needed a company that not only understood where we were headed with this, but that believed in it. Blend is that and more, and we are so happy to have them with us.

Auta meitä auttamaan. Henkilökohtaisesti. Ei kasvottomia organisaatioita. Vaan me, avoimena ja vastuullisina. Tämä ei ole rahankeräys, vaan sinä ostat mainitut tuotteet ja ne toimitetaan Gambiaan

Kuljimme syksyllä 2014 pyhiinvaelluksen Sarriasta Santiago de Compostelaan Pohjois-Espanjassa. Se oli merkittävä matka meille niin yksilöinä kuin yhdessä. Janin vakava sairaus olisi voinut olla este koko matkalle ja erittäin hyvä syy sen keskeyttämiselle. Mutta me teimme sen, yhdessä toisiamme tukien. 
Ja matka jatkuu....
Me emme elä täällä itseksemme emmekä itsellemme. Me tarvitsemme toinen toisiamme. Yhteistyö on elinehto.
Olemme saaneet kokea niin paljon hyvää omassa elämässämme, että haluamme jakaa siitä muillekin. Aina maan ääriin saakka. Ja kutsumme sinua mukaan auttamaan. Täällä kertaa avustuskohteenamme on Gambia ja siellä olevien sairaaloiden varustaminen Hyöty&Työ -projektin kanssa yhteistyössä. Tarkoituksena on, että maaliskuussa 2015 saamme lähtemään kontillisen sairaalatarvikkeita meriteitse kohti Gambiaa ja menemme itse vastaanottamaan kontin huhtikuussa ja varmistamaan, että apu menee perille. 
Jani Karlsson alias Jansku on psykologi, jolla on pitkä työhistoria kansainvälisessä liiketoiminnassa ja on erikoistunut kumppanuuksien ja pitkäjänteisten strategioiden luomiseen. Hän on myös kirjailija sekä Kanttarelli Publishingin kustannusjohtaja.
Anumari Väistö alias Ansku on yleislääkäri, joka on koulutuksensa aikana perehtynyt kehitysyhteistyöprojekteihin. Hän on myös kirjailija.
Jos et pysty tukemaan hanketta taloudellisesti, voit auttaa meitä levittämällä tietoa projektista.

Help us to help. In person. No faceless organizations. Just us, open and responsible. This is not fundraising! You are buying the products, and they will be shipped to Gambia by us and Hyöty & Työ ry
In Autumn 2014 we did a pilgrimage from Sarria to Santiago de Compostela in northern Spain. It was a very meaningful trip for both of us as individuals as well as us together. Jani's serious disease could have prevented the whole trip. It would also have been a perfectly good excuse to abort it. But we did it, helping each other along the way.
And the journey continues...
We don't live here just for ourselves. We need each-other. Co-operation is a necessity.
We have received so much good in our lives that we want to give something back. To the ends of the world, if needed. And we invite you to join us!
This time the target are hospitals in Gambia, bringing sorely needed medical equipment there. A container full of medical equipment will be sent to Gambia in March 2015. And moreover, we will go there in person in April to help and make sure that the contributions go to the right place. We work with Hyöty  & Työ -organisation who has a long history in this work.

If you can't help us financially we would really appreciate if you share the word about this project.

<p><i>Hip, Slick, &amp; GEEK is a dedicated retail center designed for the pop culture-loving GEEK, set to open in 2016 in Richardson, Texas.  An elaborate offering of pop-culture items will be on hand, related to particular brands or ""fandoms"" (the comic book, TV series, and movie properties that Geeks &amp; Nerds love and follow with enthusiasm)-  <i>apparel, collectibles, housewares, </i>handmade items and unique wares that any GEEK could want. We will also have a section for our guests who are interested in Cosplay.

</p>
<p>In the
fall of 2014, we, Jackie Clifford and Marlene van Es, approached the Pittsburgh
Food Policy Council in order to start a student group to provide policy and
research assistance to those focusing on local food issues. After building the student organization, completing policy memos, and
talking with Grow Pittsburgh, a local non-profit organization focusing on these issues, we began to realize that there is a huge need for
business and legal support in the urban agriculture community. This gap in legal &amp; business services, coupled with our passion for local foods and
environmentalism have brought us here, as Trellis, to build brand awareness and raise funds so that we can begin our journey. We believe our
business will facilitate the removal of the business and legal barriers that can inhibit businesses, non profits, and local citizens trying to pursue their dreams. With your help, we will begin to see Pittsburgh (and maybe beyond) become a haven for local food
and sustainable development. Join us on this exciting journey - we'll keep you in the loop every step of the way! Check out our infographic on our launch timeline under the gallery tab!</p>
<p><b>How We'll do It</b><br/></p>
<p>Trellis is reimagining legal and business services through a unique and affordable subscription based pricing model. To better serve organizations and individuals reliant on grants and small loans, we will charge monthly, subscription based rates or flat, project based rates. This pricing model will allow for more predictable legal and business fees for our clients instead of confusing hourly rates that come with traditional legal firms. Our pricing model will allow our clients to pay over longer periods time, while still allowing our firm to remain sustainable. As active members of the Pittsburgh Food Policy Council and of the urban agriculture &amp; ecological development community, we want to be more than simply the ""lawyers."" We want to become ""partners in the process.""</p>
<p></p>
<p>We seek to offer the following legal &amp; business services: </p>
<ul>
<li><em>Land and project zoning, permitting, and real estate transactions</em></li>
<li><em>Legal representation for urban agriculture and ecological projects/businesses</em></li>
<li><em>Business planning guidance &amp; filing for urban agriculture and ecological projects</em></li>
<li><em>Build market and contract opportunities between local food and ecologically focused businesses</em></li>
<li>
<em>Policy work, food security, and urban agriculture advocacy in front of city government bodies </em>
</li>
<li>
<em>White paper and decision analysis development </em>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get </span></p>
<p>In order to move Trellis towards serving the Pittsburgh urban agriculture &amp; ecological development community, we need your help! To keep our prices affordable, we intend to keep our overhead costs as low as possible. With that being said, we still need working capital to cover the following:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>legal search engine<br/>
</li>
<li>shared office space to meet clients</li>
<li>business filing fees</li>
<li>transportation to and from client meetings</li>
<li>liability insurance </li>
<li>marketing collateral &amp; website</li>
<li>initial employee salary costs - funds will not be used for this purpose before business operations begin</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<p>While the real reward comes with helping make Pittsburgh a sustainable and green economy, we wanted to make sure anyone who donates knows how much it means to us. Here are some perks! </p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Donations from $5-$25 receive a hand-written thank you note </li>
<li>Donations from $50-$100 receive an invitation to our formal launch event in the fall</li>
<li>Donations of $125+ receive a Trellis waterbottle</li>
<li>Anyone who donates can also request to receive a free copy of ""A Non Profit's Guide to Legal Services,"" which breaks down the intricacies of obtaining affordable legal services as a non-profit and tips on how to get the service that best fits the need</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>If we do not meet our fundraising goal of $20,000, we will prioritize available funds across the following: purchasing a legal search engine, filing our business fees and liability insurance, office space, marketing, and salaries. </p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul>
<li>Help local farmers and ecologically-minded developers create profitable businesses using vacant and/or available lot space in/around the city of Pittsburgh.</li> <li>Become a partner to urban agriculture &amp; ecological development citizens, businesses, and non-profits in the Pittsburgh area - not simply act as the ""lawyers."" </li> <li>Abandon the traditional, billable hours profit model and charge project-based &amp; subscription-based fees to help citizens, businesses, and non-profits better plan for their policy, legal, and business services expenditures. </li>
<li>A greener, more profitable, and ecological Pittsburgh. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> Trellis seeks to offer services to a very niche market, which naturally limits our customer base.

</div></div>","Who is Trellis? 

In the
fall of 2014, we, Jackie Clifford and Marlene van Es, approached the Pittsburgh
Food Policy Council in order to start a student group to provide policy and
research assistance to those focusing on local food issues. After building the student organization, completing policy memos, and
talking with Grow Pittsburgh, a local non-profit organization focusing on these issues, we began to realize that there is a huge need for
business and legal support in the urban agriculture community. This gap in legal & business services, coupled with our passion for local foods and
environmentalism have brought us here, as Trellis, to build brand awareness and raise funds so that we can begin our journey. We believe our
business will facilitate the removal of the business and legal barriers that can inhibit businesses, non profits, and local citizens trying to pursue their dreams. With your help, we will begin to see Pittsburgh (and maybe beyond) become a haven for local food
and sustainable development. Join us on this exciting journey - we'll keep you in the loop every step of the way! Check out our infographic on our launch timeline under the gallery tab!
How We'll do It
Trellis is reimagining legal and business services through a unique and affordable subscription based pricing model. To better serve organizations and individuals reliant on grants and small loans, we will charge monthly, subscription based rates or flat, project based rates. This pricing model will allow for more predictable legal and business fees for our clients instead of confusing hourly rates that come with traditional legal firms. Our pricing model will allow our clients to pay over longer periods time, while still allowing our firm to remain sustainable. As active members of the Pittsburgh Food Policy Council and of the urban agriculture & ecological development community, we want to be more than simply the ""lawyers."" We want to become ""partners in the process.""

We seek to offer the following legal & business services: 

Land and project zoning, permitting, and real estate transactions
Legal representation for urban agriculture and ecological projects/businesses
Business planning guidance & filing for urban agriculture and ecological projects
Build market and contract opportunities between local food and ecologically focused businesses

Policy work, food security, and urban agriculture advocacy in front of city government bodies 


White paper and decision analysis development 



What We Need & What You Get 
In order to move Trellis towards serving the Pittsburgh urban agriculture & ecological development community, we need your help! To keep our prices affordable, we intend to keep our overhead costs as low as possible. With that being said, we still need working capital to cover the following:


legal search engine

shared office space to meet clients
business filing fees
transportation to and from client meetings
liability insurance 
marketing collateral & website
initial employee salary costs - funds will not be used for this purpose before business operations begin


While the real reward comes with helping make Pittsburgh a sustainable and green economy, we wanted to make sure anyone who donates knows how much it means to us. Here are some perks! 


Donations from $5-$25 receive a hand-written thank you note 
Donations from $50-$100 receive an invitation to our formal launch event in the fall
Donations of $125+ receive a Trellis waterbottle
Anyone who donates can also request to receive a free copy of ""A Non Profit's Guide to Legal Services,"" which breaks down the intricacies of obtaining affordable legal services as a non-profit and tips on how to get the service that best fits the need


If we do not meet our fundraising goal of $20,000, we will prioritize available funds across the following: purchasing a legal search engine, filing our business fees and liability insurance, office space, marketing, and salaries. 
    The Impact 
Help local farmers and ecologically-minded developers create profitable businesses using vacant and/or available lot space in/around the city of Pittsburgh. Become a partner to urban agriculture & ecological development citizens, businesses, and non-profits in the Pittsburgh area - not simply act as the ""lawyers.""  Abandon the traditional, billable hours profit model and charge project-based & subscription-based fees to help citizens, businesses, and non-profits better plan for their policy, legal, and business services expenditures. 
A greener, more profitable, and ecological Pittsburgh.     Risks & Challenges  Trellis seeks to offer services to a very niche market, which naturally limits our customer base. However, we have been building our involvement in the community and engaging potential clients for over five months, which will lead to inflows of referrals from those we've communicated and worked with so far. We seek to offer a variety of services that will allow us to serve a larger number of ecologically minded clients.
We have experience in agriculture, environmental development and have developed our skills in law through environmental law clerkships.  So, while we will be newly minted attorneys, we have practical experience and are building a board of advisors and mentors to help guide us in our venture. 
While starting a new business always has risks, we have been working with business mentors and partners to make sure our model is sound and viable. 
Trellis also received third place in the Pitt Start Up Competition in January of 2015 and is currently in the final round of the Pitt Big Idea Competition (stay tuned!), making Trellis one of 30 teams who made the final cut out of over 100 original applicants - we're psyched. Trellis will also be entering the Uprize and Intersector start up competitions this spring.

Conceived in an unassuming shed in McLaren Vale (South Australia), Skin Deep Wines is the love child of three mates who share a passion for wine, tradition and life.
Adam - Creator


The Thrower stands alone, surveys the room and breathes a sigh, Someone has to live their life and someone has to die, He doesn't want to think about it, nor to be perplexed, He strides out of the ring, opens the door and murmurs ""Next."" Then the Divination hit…..IN VINO VERITAS! Mitch - Emissary“A rooster crows only when it sees the light. Put him in the dark and he'll never crow. I have seen the light and I'm crowing.”The quickest distance between two points is a straight line. Then the wine gets poured! Columbus, Magellan and Polo must have understood this fact.The journey continues!Declan - Wrangler
“Never a horse that can’t be rode and never a rider that can’t be throwed”My Pappy said to me “Son, keep ‘em straight and away from the vines. The ferment does craziness to the mind and the herd!! Make sure they stay focussed  and get ‘em home.” This trio is challenged in more ways than one but I do the best I can.The 'Love lost...' seriesIn 2013 we released our first (of ultimately three) wine series called 'Love lost...' which is about celebrating people & times that have gone before, paying homage to the roles the vigneron and the winemaker play in the making of good wine and how a memorable bottle of wine narrates moments in time.How to make a Great NightWe love wine. We spend our days working in and around wine; creating it, perfecting it, describing it, and (no surprises here) drinking it. Every now and then, when life permits, we like to head into town to check out the latest cool club, hidden lane-way bar or funky restaurant. These nights out are about forgetting the world of wine for a while, having fun with friends and trying not to injure anyone on the dance floor.  It was on one of these great nights that the idea of creating a drink that brings people together was born.  We decided that it needed to be a premium drink that appeals to women and men alike, requires the skill of a winemaker and is the ideal drink to start a great night out. AfroDizzik Premium Apple CiderAdam's talents as a winemaker are acknowledged around the world and he has received many awards and stellar reviews of his wines from people and organisations such as Winestate, James Halliday, Qantas, Decanter and many more. Ikka SirenSince that night out Adam has been busy using his winemaking skills to trial and test batches of cider in order to create a premium apple cider (free from any artificial sweeteners, colours or flavouring) made from apple juice. Many, many months later and after a lot of trial and error AfroDizzik has been perfected - and we need you help to launch it!How you can join the Party!So we've spent months perfecting the cider, researching bottling, packaging and labelling suppliers and costs and are all set to create our first batch of AfroDizzik.

Risks & ChallengesLike any new venture, nothing is ever completely predictable. Before even thinking about launching this crowdfunding campaign on INDIEGOGO we've spent many, many months thinking, planning and developing the creation of AfroDizzik.
We've trialled and tested batches and batches of cider until we felt that we had got the right one. We've spoken to owners of pubs, bottle stores, nightclubs and bars about AfroDizzik and, more importantly, we have asked people to look (and taste) our AfroDizzik cider. All of this experience, and the positive feedback we have received, has given us the courage to take the next step and launch AfroDizzik on INDIEGOGO.
Our goal is to raise $25,000 which will allow us to produce 1,500 cases of AfroDizzik premium apple cider. In the event that we don't hit our target, we will review the project and either decide to go ahead and produce a lower volume of cases (and fulfil each of the perks that have been funded) or refund each of the contributions made.FAQWho designs your labels?Both the AfroDizzik & 'Love lost...' labels were deigned by Greg Turra - an Adelaide designer & Illustrator - check out some of his other awesome work here.Who composed the music for the AfroDizzik Youtube clip?


The track is called 'Electric Road' by artist Senbeï - a Paris based musician, composer and DJ. He was born in France and studied music at the Conservatoire de Paris. He then studied cinema in Europe and in Montreal Canada. He has composed original music for short films and produced several animation movies and his recent EP release is Army of Me.Where will I be able to get AfroDizzik Premium Apple Cider?Once the INDIEGOGO campaign is successful and we have achieved our target we will start our first bottling run. The first priority will be to distribute the cases to our INDIEGOGO supporters and then we will work with our trade distributor (Pick Drinks) to get AfroDizzik into bottle shops, bars and nightclubs across Australia. I live overseas, how can I get AfroDizzik Premium Apple Cider?Right now, the cost of shipping and taxes would make it too expensive to send you a case of AfroDizzik. We're hoping to be able to fix this and have already started talking to potential distributors in New Zealand, USA and United Kingdom - so watch this space!Do you plan to produce other ciders as well?Yes. We would like to produce both a pear cider and a hard apple cider. We are also looking into the cost of producing our cider in cans.I can't contribute financially but would like to helpWe really appreciate any help you can offer and word of mouth is a powerful thing. If you like the sound of what we are doing and would like to see AfroDizzik premium apple cider in your local bottle shop, bar or restaurant then please share this INDIEGOGO campaign and our sites on your social network. 

The legal stuff
It is against the law to sell or supply alcohol to or obtain alcohol on behalf of a person under the age of 18 years. By contributing to this INDIEGOGO campaign and in return receiving a perk of AfroDizzik cider and/or 'Love lost...' wine you vouch that all of the details you have provided are true and correct and that you verify that you are 18 years of age or over. All deliveries of AfroDizzik cider and 'Love lost...' wine must therefore be received and signed for by a person over the age of 18 years. We are unable to post to PO Boxes.LICENCE NAME: Skin Deep Wines Pty LtdLICENCE NUMBER: 51405481
