<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Krisily Kennedy I am a journalist and film critic living in West Hollywood, California, but my journey started long before I moved to the west coast. While life interviewing celebrities is exciting, the road that brought me here is far more interesting. When my father died two years ago I had a lot of feeling I wasn't really sure what to do with so I started writing and soon couldn't stop. I wrote about growing up in Rhode Island with a single mother, growing up without my alcoholic father, messing up in school and even abusive relationships. The more I wrote the more I started to view my life in a different perspective. For all intents and purposes, I should have amounted to what the outside world made me feel I would, nothing. Yet I found the strength and courage in places I would never have imagined myself finding them in. I attempted to show the world what I was made of. Becoming Miss RI USA and competing at Miss USA was the beginning of me taking control over my life and my emotions. I took risks in life and love and took a chance on The Bachelor and I honestly thought taking big life risks was over after The Bachelor Pad but life decided it had other plans by making my sexuality news on gossip blogs and tabloids. I could write a book about conversations with celebrities but the truth is I want to inspire, to start conversations and even create change and the only way I know how to do that is to share my story. All of it. The good, the bad, the spectacular and even the so horrible no person should ever have to live through it. I truly believe that had I had a book to read by someone sharing their stories that I would have felt less alone, less broken and maybe I wouldn't have carried so much shame in my life for so long. Sharing my story is my way of helping make another woman feel less alone and I can't do that without your help. Self Publishing is the best way to get my story out to the world on my terms and at a time when women need each others support more than ever. This book is a passion project of mine and I know that the support I am receiving from you all has far outweighed any of the fear I have had about sharing my story.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My goal is $6,000.00 I have started researching editors, book jacket artists and formatters these will cost me at the lowest $1,500.00 each and can cost up to $3,000.00 each. All money raised will be used for editors, book jackets, printing, marketing and sending perks to contributors. Anything over the $6,000.00 that is raised will allow for better editors or artists so I welcome all contributions and hope they enable me to find the best team for this memoir that is so close to my heart. I have high hopes that you all will show me as much support as you have throughtout the years following all of my various shows and I'm hoping we can surpass $6,000.00 and make it $10,000.00! If together we can raise upwards of $10,000.00, not only will it give me enough to fully finance the publishing and printing with an amazing editor and a kick-ass cover, but it will also allow me to throw a spectacular book release party in Hollywood (and maybe even one in Rhode Island too) and every supporter will be invited to celebrate with me!</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
</div><div><p>The more we share, the more conversations are had and the more we all grow. Whether you are a woman who has lived through trauma or someone you love has, the more we share the more we understand each other. By helping me to share my story, you aren't just supporting me, you are showing that you support us all. You are showing you support any woman who has felt alone, broken, scared or less than and you are giving those woman the chance to read the story of someone who has lived as they have and been strong enough to come out on top at the end. I hope this book can inspire, encourage, motivate and maybe even amaze all who read it and your help will allow that to happen.</p></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Every venture has some risk and some challenges.The biggest challenge I would face is not raising enough funds to bring on a great editor and/or artist, which could slow down the timetable on getting perks out within the 6-month timeframe. If the full amount of funds are not reached I will use all that is raised on an editor, to me, this is the most important part of this campaign finding a great editor.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you are not able to contribute financially to this campaign I would greatly appreciate if you would share this with your family and friends who may believe in this project as much as you and I do and feel compelled to support it. If everyone supports and shares this passion project of mine, we will be able to celebrate together at a fabulous Book Release Party!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Thank you for all your support and love, helping me to make my passion project become a reality.</p>

<h3>The ""ShadowNet""</h3>
<p>In 2007 I went to Iraq on a 1-year department of defense contract to help in pioneering social media psychological warfare for the 4th Psychological Operations Group. I was tasked with migrating the 4th POG's influence operations from dropping flyers from planes, to micro-targeted, Interactive Internet Activities (IIA). Our efforts helped in maintaining support between the Sunni and Shia together for the first time in a millennia in what was known as the Sahawa, or ""The Awakening."" My name is Patrick Bergy, and it is time for an American Awakening...</p>
<p>Since my pioneering of social media psychological warfare for the Department of Defense from 2007-2010, the world has now been awakened to the threat such military-grade social media influence operations is capable of. Both foreign and domestic, the threat this poses to the integrity of U.S. elections, as well as elections around the world, is the single greatest threat to our nation. It was known commercially as, ""The ShadowNet""</p>
<h3>Non-Partisan Threat</h3>
<p>This is fraud, waste and abuse at the highest levels of our government and military. The ShadowNet was developed by Dynology, a company owned by Obama's National Security Advisor, Gen. James Jones. Paul Manafort was Dynology's partner at that time, and Jones was a lifelong friend of John McCain.</p>
<p>The ShadowNet was developed using an Obama procured military contract funded by taxpayers while Gen. Jones was Obama's National Security Advisor. Dynology was founded in 2000 by General James Jones and his family, and has profited millions from taxpayer funded military contracts while Gen. Jones served as the Commander of the Marine Corps., NATO Supreme Allied Commander, ISAF Commander, Obama's National Security Advisor. Gen. Jones also owns Jones Group International. According to news reports, Jones Group is one of the largest Saudi oil and gas lobbying firms in DC. Now ask yourself about the murder of Washington Post ""journalist"" Khashoggi. Knowing what I know about the ShadowNet and Interactive Internet Activities (IIA) I believe the justice department must take a closer look.</p>
<ul>
<li>The ShadowNet was built to provide the exact same covert/clandestine social media psychological warfare the FBI indicted the 13 Russian's for in 2018.</li>
<li>The ShadowNet and its relational database component, ""iPsy,"" was made commercially available in 2008 while Dynology was serving as John McCain's primary campaign IT provider. Paul Manafort's company, 3EDC, was Dynology's #1 preferred partner.</li>
<li>Following the 2008 primary victory, the RNC and McCain campaign paid Manafort's company, 3EDC, millions of dollars for ""micro-targeted social media"" services.</li>
<li>Khashoggi?</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>We Can't Do It Without You!</h3>
<p>We are raising funds to help in writing, editing and publishing the sequel to Patrick Bergy's, ""Victim of the Swamp..."" I raised over $1,100 with crowdfunding support for my first book, but it wasn't enough to have professionally edited, so I published it and used the funds to purchase books in bulk that I sold at events and mailed to many journalists.</p>
<p>My new book has been tentatively titled, 'ShadowNet; The American Awakening' and we are seeking your help in:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raising an initial $15,000 for research, editing and publishing of 'ShadowNet; The American Awakening'</li>
<li>Bypassing the corrupt and broken main stream media using grassroots crowdfunding and social media to get the message out showing the corruption within our nation's Fourth Estate.  </li>
<li>Like before, if we don't reach our goal, we will shift-fire as necessary and work with what we've got, not what we want. Your help is absolutely needed to make the most impact.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Goal</h3>
<p>Following the publication of The Awakening, Patrick Bergy will be attending speaking events, book signing's and Trump 2020 rallies nationwide to educate the public on how they can protect themselves, as well as the sovereignty of our nation, from the influence of the ""ShadowNet.""</p>
<p>This is what is literally happening right now by some of the most powerful people in the world, and it must be exposed and stopped:</p>
<ul>
<li>The influence of Interactive Internet Activities (IIA,) (AKA social media ""fake news"") is a systemic threat worldwide.  Un-elected former staff officers, politicians and lobbyists are using the military industrial complex to influence policies for profit, not just politics. </li>
<li>Privately owned defense companies are using real-time databases containing your social media postings, credit, criminal and travel history.</li>
<li>They then use Artificial Intelligence to create predictive behavioral psychological profiles which can be used for other IIA influence operations, or by employers when considering your employment.</li>
<li>These ""predictive"" behavioral profiles are used to determine if an existing employee is likely to steal from a company, or leak classified information, and can be used for termination based on something you're ""predictively likely"" to do; before you have done it.</li>
<li>Watch an explainer video here: <div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/XFjhyyf17OQ?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The American Awakening</h3>
<p>The Sahawa, or ""Awakening"" in Iraq brought the Sunni and Shia together to fight with the U.S., and against Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AIQ). In the most simplest terms, this was largely accomplished by giving the Sunni and Shia a common enemy, (AQI.) </p>
<p> The book, 'ShadowNet; The American Awakening' is about showing all American's, both Democrats and Republicans, America's common threat; The Military Industrial Complex.</p>
<ul>
<li>Knowledge is power and we need to let American's know of the fraud, waste and abuse the Military Industrial Complex has on our government and politics.</li>
<li>Having pioneered the ShadowNet I have a unique perspective that allows me to push back against the MIC with indisputable facts.</li>
<li>I have submitted official requests to the Congressional Intelligence Committee, Congressmen Devin Nunes, Adam Schiff, Charlie Crist, Gus Bilirakis, Matt Gaetz and the Senate Judicial Committee. The requests all included direct evidence of the ShadowNets connection the Mueller's indictments, as well as a classified briefing to discuss information I cannot disclose without being read-on. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>The Fourth Estate is broken worse than I had anticipated. It is my belief, and that of President Trump, that many journalists are little more than sub-contractors for paid influence operations.</p>
<p>I held a Top Secret clearance while pioneering social media ""fake news,"" but use the example of President Trump because he is the highest classification authority, and has access to classified information most everyone else doesn't. Regardless of political ideology or hatred for our president, everyone should want integrity in journalism. </p>
<ul>
<li>We can no longer assume the protections provided in the U.S. Constitution to protect the Fourth Estate means the information you should be getting actually gets reported.</li>

According to news reports, Jones Group is one of the largest Saudi oil and gas lobbying firms in DC. Now ask yourself about the murder of Washington Post ""journalist"" Khashoggi. Knowing what I know about the ShadowNet and Interactive Internet Activities (IIA) I believe the justice department must take a closer look.

The ShadowNet was built to provide the exact same covert/clandestine social media psychological warfare the FBI indicted the 13 Russian's for in 2018.
The ShadowNet and its relational database component, ""iPsy,"" was made commercially available in 2008 while Dynology was serving as John McCain's primary campaign IT provider. Paul Manafort's company, 3EDC, was Dynology's #1 preferred partner.
Following the 2008 primary victory, the RNC and McCain campaign paid Manafort's company, 3EDC, millions of dollars for ""micro-targeted social media"" services.
Khashoggi?


We Can't Do It Without You!
We are raising funds to help in writing, editing and publishing the sequel to Patrick Bergy's, ""Victim of the Swamp..."" I raised over $1,100 with crowdfunding support for my first book, but it wasn't enough to have professionally edited, so I published it and used the funds to purchase books in bulk that I sold at events and mailed to many journalists.
My new book has been tentatively titled, 'ShadowNet; The American Awakening' and we are seeking your help in:

Raising an initial $15,000 for research, editing and publishing of 'ShadowNet; The American Awakening'
Bypassing the corrupt and broken main stream media using grassroots crowdfunding and social media to get the message out showing the corruption within our nation's Fourth Estate.  
Like before, if we don't reach our goal, we will shift-fire as necessary and work with what we've got, not what we want. Your help is absolutely needed to make the most impact.


Our Goal
Following the publication of The Awakening, Patrick Bergy will be attending speaking events, book signing's and Trump 2020 rallies nationwide to educate the public on how they can protect themselves, as well as the sovereignty of our nation, from the influence of the ""ShadowNet.""
This is what is literally happening right now by some of the most powerful people in the world, and it must be exposed and stopped:

The influence of Interactive Internet Activities (IIA,) (AKA social media ""fake news"") is a systemic threat worldwide.  Un-elected former staff officers, politicians and lobbyists are using the military industrial complex to influence policies for profit, not just politics. 
Privately owned defense companies are using real-time databases containing your social media postings, credit, criminal and travel history.
They then use Artificial Intelligence to create predictive behavioral psychological profiles which can be used for other IIA influence operations, or by employers when considering your employment.
These ""predictive"" behavioral profiles are used to determine if an existing employee is likely to steal from a company, or leak classified information, and can be used for termination based on something you're ""predictively likely"" to do; before you have done it.
Watch an explainer video here: 



The American Awakening
The Sahawa, or ""Awakening"" in Iraq brought the Sunni and Shia together to fight with the U.S., and against Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AIQ). In the most simplest terms, this was largely accomplished by giving the Sunni and Shia a common enemy, (AQI.) 
 The book, 'ShadowNet; The American Awakening' is about showing all American's, both Democrats and Republicans, America's common threat; The Military Industrial Complex.

Knowledge is power and we need to let American's know of the fraud, waste and abuse the Military Industrial Complex has on our government and politics.
Having pioneered the ShadowNet I have a unique perspective that allows me to push back against the MIC with indisputable facts.
I have submitted official requests to the Congressional Intelligence Committee, Congressmen Devin Nunes, Adam Schiff, Charlie Crist, Gus Bilirakis, Matt Gaetz and the Senate Judicial Committee. The requests all included direct evidence of the ShadowNets connection the Mueller's indictments, as well as a classified briefing to discuss information I cannot disclose without being read-on. 


Other Ways You Can Help
The Fourth Estate is broken worse than I had anticipated. It is my belief, and that of President Trump, that many journalists are little more than sub-contractors for paid influence operations.
I held a Top Secret clearance while pioneering social media ""fake news,"" but use the example of President Trump because he is the highest classification authority, and has access to classified information most everyone else doesn't. Regardless of political ideology or hatred for our president, everyone should want integrity in journalism. 

We can no longer assume the protections provided in the U.S. Constitution to protect the Fourth Estate means the information you should be getting actually gets reported.

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Technology is great and has so many benefits, but there's a downside when it steals our time and true social interaction. As a parent, I was inspired to write this story to help start the conversation about balancing screen time with my own kids in a fun and approachable way. We realized other parents and educators can use this story to discuss healthy choices when it comes to screens and other activities that spark creativity and ensure time for physical activity.</p>
<p>We were able to self-publish a limited first run through a Kickstarter campaign. With the positive reception of the first print run, we hope to make this book available to a much wider audience. The flexible funding options with Indiegogo ensures every order will be delivered regardless of whether the target goal is met. Funds raised will help cover the cost of moving this book to the next level (we're working with Friesen Press), in making it available in bookstores across Canada and internationally.</p>
<p>The target audience for this story is young children, and with my husband being a teacher, we've sought input from teacher/librarian friends who sampled the story with the children they work with. The insight of these kids was incredibly helpful and positive! To help this message reach more children, we've geared our Indiegogo campaign to include options where purchased books can be donated to local school libraries or classrooms.</p> <p><strong>What we need and what you get</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to raise at least $3,000 towards the initial costs to move this book to print and a wide distribution through Friesen Press. Those who order through this campaign will receive a number of reward options that include stickers, bookmarks and coloring pages. Eugene, the illustrator, has also created adorable amigurumi versions of these characters. Those who choose this particular reward level can select the color of their choice for their very own Invisibles amigurumi plushie.</p>

<h2><strong>Short Summary</strong></h2>
<p>My name is Carolyn Shanti. It took me five years to write this novel, 'Trap, Prey, Lust', about sexual abuse. As a child I was severely sexually abused by my father, who was a successful business man in the fashion industry in London. For years, I knew that there was something deep down inside me that was troubled, but it took years to experience the memories of the abuse and I became ill during that time with post traumatic stress. I have a wonderful doctor who has helped me to recover. It has taken five years to heal and I am deeply aware of all the stages of healing.</p>
<p>In my working life I have been a social worker for over thirty years, working mainly in hospitals helping those who are suffering from debilitating illnesses such as cancer. I have also worked with patients suffering from brain injury and those who are terminally ill. I taught at Melbourne University for four years, teaching social work and social policy. But I wrote many articles and conducted research on social issues in the United Kingdom, Australia and India. I also trained later in my life as a healer and had a healing practice in London for many years, and ran courses for others who wish to train for this profession.</p>
<p>My campaign and mission are very important to me because I have suffered and survived years of sexual abuse. I want to create more awareness globally about the problem and what it means for those who experience this kind of suffering. At the same time, I would like to offer hope, in particular to women, that there is the possibility to heal under medical supervision and in the form of holistic therapies. Now I understand the stages of healing - and denial - I can at least point out the journey of healing to others.</p>
<p>I hope to take the book around the United Kingdom and to other countries who are badly affected by these issues to offer help, awareness, and to encourage people to come forward and make a difference in their own communities.

<p>Contributors to my crowdfunding campaign will be helping to achieve the publishing objectives to get the book printed and circulated in many countries. Further to that, contributions will make it possible for me to go and speak about the book, to raise awareness and hope to those who suffer.

I will share my story and talk about the stages of healing and recovery in sexual abuse.</p>
<p>Many people see reports of child abuse in the newspapers and in the media every day, but they do not know what to do, what action to take, often feeling powerless to make a difference. Your contribution will help one person, one survivor, to share, and to make a difference on a global level.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
My name is Carolyn Shanti. It took me five years to write this novel, 'Trap, Prey, Lust', about sexual abuse. As a child I was severely sexually abused by my father, who was a successful business man in the fashion industry in London. For years, I knew that there was something deep down inside me that was troubled, but it took years to experience the memories of the abuse and I became ill during that time with post traumatic stress. I have a wonderful doctor who has helped me to recover. It has taken five years to heal and I am deeply aware of all the stages of healing.
In my working life I have been a social worker for over thirty years, working mainly in hospitals helping those who are suffering from debilitating illnesses such as cancer. I have also worked with patients suffering from brain injury and those who are terminally ill. I taught at Melbourne University for four years, teaching social work and social policy. But I wrote many articles and conducted research on social issues in the United Kingdom, Australia and India. I also trained later in my life as a healer and had a healing practice in London for many years, and ran courses for others who wish to train for this profession.
My campaign and mission are very important to me because I have suffered and survived years of sexual abuse. I want to create more awareness globally about the problem and what it means for those who experience this kind of suffering. At the same time, I would like to offer hope, in particular to women, that there is the possibility to heal under medical supervision and in the form of holistic therapies. Now I understand the stages of healing - and denial - I can at least point out the journey of healing to others.
I hope to take the book around the United Kingdom and to other countries who are badly affected by these issues to offer help, awareness, and to encourage people to come forward and make a difference in their own communities. The countries that have the highest statistics are; the United Kingdom, India, Africa, Australia and the United States of America.
Contributors to my crowdfunding campaign will be helping to achieve the publishing objectives to get the book printed and circulated in many countries. Further to that, contributions will make it possible for me to go and speak about the book, to raise awareness and hope to those who suffer. In each place, it is envisioned that each community will be supported by my visit and will rally their own resources to help sufferers in their own towns and cities. I will share my story and talk about the stages of healing and recovery in sexual abuse.
Many people see reports of child abuse in the newspapers and in the media every day, but they do not know what to do, what action to take, often feeling powerless to make a difference. Your contribution will help one person, one survivor, to share, and to make a difference on a global level.
What We Need & What You Get

The funds raised will go towards the production costs for the paperback book and ebook (editing, proofreading, typesetting, printing, ebook conversion, registration with Nielsen, ISBN allocation etc).
It will also contribute to the creation of the website, social media platforms, book cover design and other visual assets. As well as PR and marketing to help spread the word. 
Further to the creation of the novel, I will be starting my ‘tour’ in the UK and then branching out to the United States, Australia, Europe, Africa and Asia, to host book signings, talks and seminars, with the aim of reaching out to – and helping – the many people who have suffered sexual abuse. Through sharing my story and experiences, I hope to have a positive impact on those suffering similar to what I have undergone.​
If we don’t reach the total goal, we will ensure the book is produced to the highest standard possible and that it is available to buy worldwide, and then look at other ways to reach people who will gain so much from meeting me and hearing about my story person-to-person – beyond the book.

The Impact
Sexual crimes are some of the worst crimes now all over the world. The problems of sexual abuse, abuse of children, sex trafficking, pornography, paedophile groups etc are tragically on the rise. Thousands of people suffer everywhere, and the statistics are rising each year. Individuals who are able and experienced need to take a stand, to make a difference, so that as a global community we are fighting against terrible issues such as these.

As a social worker over a period of thirty years, both in hospitals and communities, I worked and wrote articles about social issues. In the United Kingdom and Australia I wrote and published articles on the problem of homelessness and in so doing was able over some five years able to make a difference in the law and making better provision for homeless people.
In Australia, I wrote and published a paper on the issue of the care of attempted suicide patients in public hospitals. There was poor follow up for this kind of patient and then I visited hospitals hoping to change the kind of policy and patient procedure. This time of publication and networking did - in the end - make a difference. More staff were added to the programmes to take care of the needs of the patients living in the community.
There are numerous projects that I have taken on in my role as a social worker in a senior position where I was able to make a difference. 
The social issues we have today in many countries seem enormous. But if we take one step each in changing things then we will be able to make a difference.

<h3>Who am I and why should you care?</h3>
<p>I am a happily married momma of 4 children; two adult daughters and two teenagers that I currently have the privilege of homeschooling. I have been passionate about words and stories since I was 10 years old, when my insightful Mom handed me my first journal. She recognized the need in helping a young voice to be heard, if only in the blank pages of a book. <br/> </p>
<p>I am now passionate about utilizing the written word to help future generations become men and women of integrity. To that end, I started writing a children's book series where each new book contains an adventure and is wrapped around a single truth or value to be learned. <i>(""Katrina: Growing Wings"" was first published in 2008 with a company that has since recently dissolved; hence, I am seeking to republish it on my own.).</i> The concepts of these stories are simple enough for a child to identify with, yet challenging enough for adults to adhere to and it is my hope that they will resonate with all ages.</p>
<p>It is my belief that our readers are intelligent and hungry for someone to show them how to become the best possible version of themselves, while looking out for the interests of others and never forgetting their purpose. I also believe in a world with so many voices calling out to our children and telling them who they are and who they are not, we need to work together to help them find that voice that speaks truth; to help them to become strong individuals of integrity who are willing to fight to be heard.</p>
<p>If this mission appeals to your heart as well, I have several different ways in which you can contribute and <strong><i>I want you to know that there is no small contribution</i></strong>. Every single cent is a huge blessing and greatly appreciated by me and all our future readers!</p>

<li>All risk is entirely mine and I will cover any costs that I cannot fund with credit cards; however, this is not ideal. IF I do fall short of my goal, all monies contributed will go towards re-publishing <i>""Katrina: Growing Wings,"" </i>then to illustrating and publishing the next two books.</li>
<li>Some of the challenges I currently face,  outside of the financial,  are finding the right illustrator to bring <i>""Katrina""</i> to life, familiarizing myself with the self-publishing world, and maintaining a social media presence.</li>
<li>I have some moderate health challenges that I am seeking to heal.</li>
<li><p>Regardless of the fundraiser outcome, backers will receive their perks as requested, as they become available.</p></li>

That brings my all-in budget to $1990.  I am seeking to raise $1500 of that here with all of you on Indiegogo.


I am happy to invest, but what can I expect in return?  

I have 4 different levels of contributions available.Level 1- The High Flier ($100) (15 available)People who choose to contribute at this level will have:*Option to have signed copies of all three books-upon availability-for free.*Option to buy copies at 30% off retail price for first 90 days of book being in print.*They can choose a name to be written into future books.*Signed poster of ""Katrina.""* Mailed ""Thank-you"" card & social media ""Thanks"" & recognition.*Opportunity to become part of the books' launch team.*If there are any aspiring authors at this level: I offer a free critique of your first 5000 words or 5 page pdf file. This includes grammar, vocabulary, story flow, etc. 

Level 2-Spreading our Wings ($50) (25 available)People who choose to contribute at this level will have:*Option to have signed copies of all three books upon availability for free.

*Option to buy copies at 15% off retail price for first 60 days of book being in print.*Social media ""Thanks"" & recognition.Level 3-Caterpillar with a dream ($15) People who choose to contribute at this level will have:*Signed book of choiceLevel 4-Raffle (2 available)People who choose to contribute at any level, including 1-3, will have:*Opportunity to win signed first edition of ""Katrina: Growing Wings"" with matching journal.*Opportunity to become a part of my launch parties when my books are published.


Risks & Challenges

All risk is entirely mine and I will cover any costs that I cannot fund with credit cards; however, this is not ideal. IF I do fall short of my goal, all monies contributed will go towards re-publishing ""Katrina: Growing Wings,"" then to illustrating and publishing the next two books.
Some of the challenges I currently face,  outside of the financial,  are finding the right illustrator to bring ""Katrina"" to life, familiarizing myself with the self-publishing world, and maintaining a social media presence.
I have some moderate health challenges that I am seeking to heal.
Regardless of the fundraiser outcome, backers will receive their perks as requested, as they become available.
Overcoming these challenges: I have a super support system in place, have enrolled in the Self-Publishing School and am being mentored by an amazing author, Marcy Pusey.

 
Other Ways You Can HelpI understand that most of us don't have a mighty expendable income and you may feel like there wouldn't be any way you could be of assistance. But, with all due respect, you couldn't be more wrong! There are some very necessary and practical ways that you could help that wouldn't cost you a cent.

Help me get the word out and make some noise about this campaign.
 Use the Indiegogo share tools! Just because I am socially inept when it comes to technology, doesn't mean that I assume you are! Facebook, Twitter, Youtube...whatever your flavor, please share.
If you are in the habit of praying for others, I would really appreciate all prayers as I seek to grow in my gifts.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Dear LeVan D. Hawkins,</p>
<p>Congratulations. You have been accepted into the Quarry at Marble House Project.  We received many applications and the process was extremely competitive.  We were thrilled to have the opportunity to view your selection of artistic work and at this time we would like to offer you a residency at Marble House Project for our 2016 season. The residency session we would like to offer you is:  September 26th – October 14th 2016</p>
<p>-------</p>
<p>What an excellent time for this residency!  In a few days, my book proposal, written to attract an agent for my book, <i>What Men Do</i>, will be completed.  Doing the proposal has helped me create a strong structure for my book.  New scenes and memories came to me every day.  I completed a rough draft last November.  I’m looking forward to working on a rough draft of the book at Marble House and returning home with that momentum. </p>
<p>I have been working on this book since I first attended Antioch University – LA in June 2009. I received my MFA in June of 2011. A draft of <i>What Men Do</i> was my creative thesis.  <i>What Men Do</i> is a familial love story, an unlikely relationship between me and my oldest nephew who I didn’t meet until he was twenty-seven.  Upon our first meeting, he snarled and deemed me “bourgeois (or more accurately, ‘bourgie’)” In my mind, I called him “ghetto.”  <i>What Men Do</i> addresses issues of class conflict in urban communities, mentoring, masculinity, fatherless sons, family obligations, and race.  I call it a family saga with sociological underpinnings. </p>
<p>I’m excited about the great response I’ve received from writers I respect and from the various workshops and residencies like Marble House Project who have invited me to attend as result of sending in various chapters from What Men Do. I have worked on this book for seven years.  Seven years! I’ve read about other writers working on a book that long but never thought I had the patience.  Now, I know I’m in it until it’s done.</p>
<p>Marble House Project’s website is at <a href=""http://www.marblehouseproject.org."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.marblehouseproject.org.</a>  It’s a beautiful estate and looks so peaceful, I am uplifted every time I look at the pictures.  In the eighteen days, I am there, I will have the opportunity to get important work done. And clear my mind.  This year has been tremendously stressful financially and emotionally.  I’m trying to integrate as much possible my creative life with the life of a caregiver. That’s difficult but not impossible. It’s all about focus, organization, discipline, and time management in the face of challenge. Despite my success, I know it’s time for me to get away for a while. My brother will take on more duties and I have someone who will take my place while I’m gone. I need extra funds for that in addition to travel, food and entertainment, and incidentals so I’m looking for help from my friends, family, fans of my work, and friends of the arts. </p>
<p>Thanks for reading.</p>

What an excellent time for this residency!  In a few days, my book proposal, written to attract an agent for my book, What Men Do, will be completed.  Doing the proposal has helped me create a strong structure for my book.  New scenes and memories came to me every day.  I completed a rough draft last November.  I’m looking forward to working on a rough draft of the book at Marble House and returning home with that momentum. 
I have been working on this book since I first attended Antioch University – LA in June 2009. I received my MFA in June of 2011. A draft of What Men Do was my creative thesis.  What Men Do is a familial love story, an unlikely relationship between me and my oldest nephew who I didn’t meet until he was twenty-seven.  Upon our first meeting, he snarled and deemed me “bourgeois (or more accurately, ‘bourgie’)” In my mind, I called him “ghetto.”  What Men Do addresses issues of class conflict in urban communities, mentoring, masculinity, fatherless sons, family obligations, and race.  I call it a family saga with sociological underpinnings. 
I’m excited about the great response I’ve received from writers I respect and from the various workshops and residencies like Marble House Project who have invited me to attend as result of sending in various chapters from What Men Do. I have worked on this book for seven years.  Seven years! I’ve read about other writers working on a book that long but never thought I had the patience.  Now, I know I’m in it until it’s done.
Marble House Project’s website is at www.marblehouseproject.org.  It’s a beautiful estate and looks so peaceful, I am uplifted every time I look at the pictures.  In the eighteen days, I am there, I will have the opportunity to get important work done. And clear my mind.  This year has been tremendously stressful financially and emotionally.  I’m trying to integrate as much possible my creative life with the life of a caregiver. That’s difficult but not impossible. It’s all about focus, organization, discipline, and time management in the face of challenge. Despite my success, I know it’s time for me to get away for a while. My brother will take on more duties and I have someone who will take my place while I’m gone. I need extra funds for that in addition to travel, food and entertainment, and incidentals so I’m looking for help from my friends, family, fans of my work, and friends of the arts.

<h3><strong>Womby’s School for Wayward Witches—In Audiobook Format</strong></h3>
<p>Hi, I’m Sarina Dorie, a fantasy and science fiction author. I also write mystery, romance and humor, and have sold over 150 short stories to magazines. I have over 40 novels published.</p>
<p>By day, I’m a public-school art teacher, artist, belly dance performer and instructor, fashion designer, and a few other things. By night, I write.</p>
<p>My most popular novels are from <i>Womby’s School for Wayward Witches Series</i>. Not only is the Womby’s series a fun cozy mystery for witch lovers everywhere, but it will expose you to what it’s like to be an art teacher in a public-school setting: overcrowded classrooms, budget cuts, and plenty of drama and awkward situations.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576959936/wuipic43pyjnrwusffds.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>(I'm quite certain, that's a portrait of me as a teacher.)</p>
<h3>Why Put the Fun Back into Funerals—er—Fundraising?</h3>
<p>I’m often asked why I don’t have an audiobook for my entire series yet. While I love the enthusiasm of my fans, the simple explanation is that producing an audiobook is costly and all that money is needed upfront. As a school teacher, there’s no way I can afford to produce an eighteen-book series of audiobooks by myself, so I need your help!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576960365/dqoauda2ygtew68cwgcl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Why Audiobooks?</h3>
<p>Besides the demand of my fans, the reason I’m enthusiastic about audiobooks as a medium for telling my stories is because it makes them more accessible, especially for those with disabilities.</p>
<p>After my concussion (resulting in a traumatic brain injury), I discovered how aggravating not being able to read or use computers could be, and I can only imagine how frustrating that must be for people who are permanently disabled.</p>
<p>My dream is to make my hex-positive, witchy mystery novels available to every eager reader, regardless of format. The first step to that goal is making an audiobook.</p>
<p>Additionally, as part of this fundraiser, I am including ways to donate to the Talking Book and Braille Library to help provide more materials to more people who need them.</p>
<p>Thank you for helping make that dream a reality!</p>

<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>I am super thankful to Indiegogo donors and my readers for helping me raise funds for the first book in the series. I raised $1,309, enough to produce the first audiobook. I estimate the audiobook of Tardy Bells and Witches’ Spells will be ready later in March.</p>
<p>If I can raise another $1500, I can produce the second book in the series.</p>
<p>As a ‘thank you’ for donating, I have many fun presents or “perks” you can choose from:</p>
<ul>
<li>Books in audio format prior to them being published on Audible.</li>
<li>Books not yet released on Amazon like <i>The Vega Bloodmire Cozy Witch Mystery Series’ first book, Ghoulish Charms </i>offered in EPUB, PDF, and MOBI formats.</li>

<li>Original art create by the author for book covers.</li>
<li>Witch-related grab bags, notepads, stickers, or other items.</li>

<h3>How to Mitigate Challenges with a Merlin-class Celestor</h3>
<p>For you, as a reader, your biggest risk is investing in a project and hating a narrator’s voice—and not wanting to listen to the books afterwards. As an audiobook listener myself, I know how that is. Some narrators have made me wince with their shrill voices or forceful speech patterns.</p>
<p>Unfortunately Alan Rickman is no longer available to narrate—may he rest in peace—and we all have different tastes.</p>
<p>Fortunately for listeners, I am picky and have champagne tastes, just like Vega Bloodmire. I will only use someone who is the Merlin-class Celestor of audiobook narrators and reads with magic. I am pleased with the narrator I interviewed and put through rounds of testing.</p>
<p>I think you will be too!</p>

<strong>It’s a Disrupter:</strong> <em>The Way</em> is a disruptor in that it covers topics covered in other books yet adds in new information in a context that takes everything to a whole-other-level. It's like the ""One Book to Rule Them All"" but in a good way.</li>
<li>
<strong>You are Helping Start More than Just a Book: </strong>Think and Grow Rich, The 7 Habits of Highly Successful People, Chicken Soup for the Soul, and others all started as one book but then evolved into a brand and company like the Napoleon Hill Foundation and The Franklin Covey Foundation. We are doing the same thing here. At this point, The 7<sup>th</sup> Foundation is in start-up mode and needs all the support it can get. The 7th Foundation is what harnesses and directs all our efforts now and for generations to come.</li>
<li>
<strong>It's Our Mission:</strong> We are ramping up and will not stop!  This is our Lifes Mission. So with the right funding, our success is as close to a sure bet as it gets. Let us show you what we can do with some help!</li>

This is why <em>The Way</em> was created.

Within “The Book” and its “4 Pillars” of “Self,” “Society,” “Universe,” and “God,” I found my notes referring the “Keys” to “True Success.”</p><p>When I collected them all and put the “7 Keys” together in the right order, it was like a secret code got unlocked, and I discovered <em>The Way</em>. After this discovery, I wrote for three days straight without much sleep or doing anything else. I then worked over the next five years to finish the book at the exclusion of most other things. <em>The Way</em> is the book I wish I found at the start of my quest. It is a positive message that can help a lot of people and possibly change everything.</p><p>Since this discovery, I have been compelled to get this message out in as many ways as possible. The ultimate goal of <em>The Way</em>, The 7th Foundation, The Movement, and everything else that will follow, is to be a catalyst that spurs meaningful positive change within people's lives and our society to create a world of lasting peace and happiness that everyone can enjoy.</p><p>Know that this was not the work of one person, a few, or even a team. <em>The Way</em> is the collective work of humanity and took thousands of years to create. The solution, I have named <em>The Way</em>, was only made possible because I was able to join the knowledge and wisdom from our most celebrated minds throughout the ages.

It’s commercial and intelligent. It’s unique. And you have an engaging writing style. You’re also bringing something new, valuable, and marketable to your category, and I like that your work explores meaningful themes. Not every book has to “matter” but I prefer that type of book (and author). In addition, your marketing background makes it much more likely you’ll get where you want to go. In short, you have a lot to be optimistic about, and lastly, I like that you’re coachable and committed and have a sense of humor (the longer I do this, the more I pay attention to those things, too).”</p><p>One of my publishers, who has read hundreds of self-help, self-development, and success books as well as publishes them, found great wisdom within <em>The Way</em> that he had not found anywhere else, and this helped them through a very challenging life event.</p><p>A Hollywood type said, ""Wow, this is like the Rocky Story plus The Secret on Steroids!</p><p>There is something for everyone within <em>The Way</em>. This can’t be said for most books, and that’s the point. The Way is not like most books. It’s as one of my publishers said after he and others reviewed <em>The Way</em>. “We have never seen anything like this, as most self-help and success type books are all just regurgitation of past work of people like Covey and Robbins. This is truly original and mind-blowing. It could change everything!”</p><p>Some have called it ""The Handbook for Humanity.""</p><hr color=""#FFFFFF"" size=""6"" style=""border:2px dashed;"" width=""400""/><p> </p><h1 style=""text-align: center;"">The Way Is Needed<br/>Now More Than Ever</h1><p>We need only to pick up a newspaper or turn on the news to see the negativity that is rising around the world. The negativity and wrongness of the world are clearly evident. What is even more evident is that people are rising up and clamoring for real practical positive solutions all around the world. Our connectedness has helped us all become more aware of our similarities as well as our growing global power to create positive change.</p><p>The questions answered within <em>The Way</em> can be seen as a formula that once input into a human and our society, the code will affect positive change from within. <em>The Way</em> is a catalyst and codified in a way that focuses and moves us in positive directions. <em>The Way</em> is a complete solution that will save us time and help us become better people, improve our relationships, and help create a better society. It not only includes all the information and implementation strategies but also charts, lists, and examples that can be customized to create a plan that fits your life. So far, all who understand The Way have said this is needed more than ever.

He is not someone that you would have expected to write a book. He was born with a lazy eye, which made him legally blind in one eye. As a result, he wore a patch over his good eye to improve his vision. He has dyslexia and other “learning disabilities,” so he struggled with reading, writing, and arithmetic. Little was known about “learning disabilities” at the time, so learning and adapting to life’s challenges at an early age was difficult.</p><p>Along with these issues, he was also bullied by his peers and adults, with one elementary school teacher even going as far as to ridicule him in front of the class, telling him to drop out of school and get a job because he was too stupid to ever graduate.</p><p>He learned to compensate and even became an avid reader and listener to books with a lot of extra effort on his part, the support of his mother, sister, a special teacher, and aid from services for the blind and handicapped. It's important to note that along with these “learning challenges” came some great gifts that allowed him to do and see things others could not. He has always been a very spiritual person with a special connection to nature.</p><p>He went on to not only graduate from high school as the Vice President of the student body but went on to earn a BA in Speech and Communications as well as minors in Religious Studies and Eastern Philosophy. After graduation, he then spent a few years teaching English in Japan and traveling the world, which enhanced his knowledge before returning to the USA.</p><p>Throughout his life, Andrew has always worked hard. He was forced into it because of his learning disabilities, but he also likes doing a good job even if no one will see or know about it. Andrew has won many accolades throughout his career and is known as an innovator, an out of the box thinker, and someone who gets the job done. He started working when he was very young by doing odd jobs and selling things for money or trade. For example, in elementary school, he created a little business selling collectibles he got from the ice cream man that got so popular the principal called his parents to shut it down because it was taking all the other children’s lunch money.</p><p>At various times he was a paperboy, lifeguard, swimming teacher, gas station attendant, construction worker, stock boy, cashier, appliance repairman, handyman, gardener, janitor, dishwasher, landscaper, food server, personal trainer, security guard/bouncer, martial arts and self-defense teacher, cook, furniture mover, teleprompter operator, teacher, salesman, sales manager, IT manager, recruiter, recruiter manager, marketer, trainer, public speaker, business partner, business owner, startup developer, website programmer, internet marketing and SEO expert, founder, owner and CEO of Consulting Ace Inc. since 1999, and now the author of The Way and the founder of The 7th Foundation.</p><p>Andrew has always been very healthy and fit and is what many would call a health and fitness fanatic. He stopped eating all forms of junk food, by choice, at 13 years old after learning about the benefits of real food compared to the harmful effects of junk food. Since then, he has studied all facets of food, health, the human body, mind, longevity, and ways to train and repair ourselves.</p><p>He participated in sports while in school, including track, cross-country, basketball, and crew (rowing team). He has competed in triathlons, is an expert swimmer, mountain biker, and yoga practitioner, as well as earned degrees in many forms of martial arts.</p><p>Andrew was also forced to learn even more profound lessons of the body and mind as he was injured seriously many times in life. While some of these injuries left him with permanent issues, today, few people could recognize any physical limitations aside from the inability to sit in one place for too long.</p><p>There is so much more to Andrew as he has lived quite the adventurous life and has had many nail-biting and mind-blowing experiences. It would take a whole book even to begin to tell his story correctly. You will also learn a little more about him in the first chapter of <em>The Way</em>.</p><p>Hopefully, the little taste we have given you here is enough to see that while most people would not have picked Andrew as someone who should write a book, knowing his life and his knowledge base, Andrew is definitely someone we want doing so.</p><p> </p><p><i>“Learning Disabilities” Note:</i> What society has negatively labeled as “Learning Disabilities” are really just “Learning Differences” and alternative ways of thinking that often come with great gifts. This simply means, in most cases, the cookie-cutter teaching methods that work for most everyone, just need to be altered to reach these people. If we can master educating this group, it will help our society, for many, if not most, of our greatest achievers and thinkers, have one or more of these issues. Some of whom include: George Washington, Leonardo da Vinci, Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein, George Patton, Winston Churchill, Henry Ford, Walt Disney, Pablo Picasso, Ludwig van Beethoven, Alexander Graham Bell, John F. Kennedy, Dr. Temple Grandin, Daymond John, Gavin Newsom, Cher, Agatha Christie, Woopie Goldberg, Steve Jobs, Erin Brockovich, Keira Knightley, W.B. Yeats, Keanu Reeves, Jay Leno, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Tom Cruise, John Lennon, Muhammad Ali, Tommy Hilfiger, Richard Branson, and Elon Musk.</p><hr color=""#FFFFFF"" size=""6"" style=""border:2px dashed;"" width=""400""/><p> </p><h1 style=""text-align: center;"">More Than Just a Book<br/>It's Our Mission<br/>The 7th Foundation</h1><p>We are not only releasing the books and all the supporting materials but also starting a foundation and movement.</p><p>Our mission is to be a catalyst that spurs meaningful positive change within people's lives and our society in order to create a world of lasting peace and happiness that everyone can enjoy.</p><p>Our motto is “All for one, one for all, united we stand, divided we fall!” which we have borrowed from The Musketeers.</p><p>The 7th Foundation is dedicated to spreading the messages found within <em>The Way</em> and helping the founder with his great mission.

Wish to Know Why You Are Here & The Meaning of Life?
Dream About Being Healthy, Happy & Successful?
Regret Not Finishing or Doing Things Well?
Desire Lasting Positive Relationships & Families?
Want to Know What to Do Every Day to Be Your Best?
Hope to Be Influential, Significant, & Make a Real Positive Difference in the World?
Need to Find that Missing Piece or a Total Solution?
If you answered Yes to any of these questions you need:  The Way(See Many More Questions Answered within The Way below and here: https://7way.me/the-way/what-you-will-learn-que...)The problem is that if you are to be your best, live a meaningful life and make a real difference in the world, you need to integrate a wide variety of vital information into your life as quickly as possible.This is why The Way was created.If The Way is the answer or even contains part of the solution that you have been seeking, you don’t want to let this opportunity slip by and always wonder who you could have been.So, the question is will you take this opportunity to look a little deeper?You Found The Way at this Critical Moment for a Very Important Reason.So Why Not Take Moment and Learn More?You have Nothing to Lose and Everything to Gain.I discovered The Way on April 3, 2015, while sorting the beginning and the ending of another book I have been working on for over 30 years covering how to be our best in all facets of life.I keep finding my references to ""this is key to true success,"" and once I put the ""7 keys"" together in the right order, it was like a secret code got unlocked, and I discovered The Way.  After this discovery, I wrote for 3 days straight without much sleep or doing anything else. I then worked over the next 5 years to finish the book. (You can learn more about The Way in the second video above, within the text below and on our website: https://7Way.Me)I know The Way claims to cover many topics that may sound too good to be true. I was right there with you. I could not believe what I found. However, sometimes, big discoveries do happen. This is something where the truth of it cannot be denied.  The people I have shared the book with so far have expressed to me the positive impact it has had on their lives and how grateful they are for these new perspectives.  They love the book and believe it will help a lot of people. You can see the testimonials within the campaign text and on our website, https://7Way.Me. The Way is not just another book nor The 7th Foundation just another company. This is a discovery and organization that can change everything in a very positive way, very quickly.  Key Facts:

The Way has a publisher and is being released in spring 2020.
Its Life Manual and Child & Family Guide have been written, are in editing, and are due late 2020 or early 2021.
At LEVEL 1: $15,000 we can cover 3 months of basic marketing and publicity for The Way. 

At Levels 2 and above ($150,000) we can work to:
Cover more publicity and marketing opportunities regarding the first book.
Publish, market, and promote volume 2 and 3.
Establish The 7th Foundation that will support everything.
Create audio-books, courses, certifications, training materials, apps, other books, and much more!


The goal of this campaign is to give The Way and The 7th Foundation the great launch they deserve. With your help, we will make this happen! Below are more details on the campaign.Please Visit https://7Way.Me for information on the books, foundation, author, mission, and movement. I'm sorry I could not spend a lot of money and time creating a slick information page and videos like some others. I simply don't have the time or resources. If I did, I probably would not need to be here asking for your help ;-)If You Can't Fund this Project, Please Help Spread the Word!!  Why Do We NeedThe Funding?As you may or may not know, publishing, marketing, and publicizing a book is expensive and Publishers do not provide much support unless you are famous. Instead, they expect the author to do virtually everything. Add on the creation of a company, courses, videos, social media management, additional content, events and all the rest, and it becomes even more expensive. While the last 5 years have not been easy, I have gained strength by keeping my eye on the goal. The truth is that the time is short and the need is great, and I can't do everything by myself.I need your help so I can hire professionals who can give The Way and The 7th Foundation the great launch they deserve. With your help, we will make this happen! Higher levels of funding simply mean we can grow bigger, better, and faster! There is no amount of funding that would be too much or go to waste.

$128,000: Marketing & Publicity for Volume 2 & 3 when released.  The goal is to launch both books at the same time to save on having to do a separate launch.

It’s a Disrupter: The Way is a disruptor in that it covers topics covered in other books yet adds in new information in a context that takes everything to a whole-other-level. It's like the ""One Book to Rule Them All"" but in a good way.

You are Helping Start More than Just a Book: Think and Grow Rich, The 7 Habits of Highly Successful People, Chicken Soup for the Soul, and others all started as one book but then evolved into a brand and company like the Napoleon Hill Foundation and The Franklin Covey Foundation. We are doing the same thing here. At this point, The 7th Foundation is in start-up mode and needs all the support it can get. The 7th Foundation is what harnesses and directs all our efforts now and for generations to come.

It's Our Mission: We are ramping up and will not stop!  This is our Lifes Mission. So with the right funding, our success is as close to a sure bet as it gets. Let us show you what we can do with some help!

If The Way is the answer or even has part of the answer you have been seeking, you don’t want to let this opportunity slip by and always wonder who you could have been.You Found The Way at this Critical Moment for a Very Important ReasonSo Why Not Take Moment and Learn More?You have Nothing to Lose & Everything to Gain  I discovered The Way on April 3, 2015, while sorting the beginning and the ending of “The Book” I have been working on for over 30 years covering how to be our best physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually, financially, in relationships, as a family, and in society. Within “The Book” and its “4 Pillars” of “Self,” “Society,” “Universe,” and “God,” I found my notes referring the “Keys” to “True Success.”When I collected them all and put the “7 Keys” together in the right order, it was like a secret code got unlocked, and I discovered The Way. After this discovery, I wrote for three days straight without much sleep or doing anything else. I then worked over the next five years to finish the book at the exclusion of most other things. The Way is the book I wish I found at the start of my quest. It is a positive message that can help a lot of people and possibly change everything.Since this discovery, I have been compelled to get this message out in as many ways as possible. The ultimate goal of The Way, The 7th Foundation, The Movement, and everything else that will follow, is to be a catalyst that spurs meaningful positive change within people's lives and our society to create a world of lasting peace and happiness that everyone can enjoy.Know that this was not the work of one person, a few, or even a team. The Way is the collective work of humanity and took thousands of years to create. The solution, I have named The Way, was only made possible because I was able to join the knowledge and wisdom from our most celebrated minds throughout the ages. To be clear, this is not about me; it’s about the message. The Way AnswersMany Important QuestionsSome are Listed Below.  There are many, many more.1. What is your purpose?2.

This guide can be used anytime by jumping to the section of interest, yet it will become of even greater value after an understanding of The Way and Life Manual have been gained.How Do You Use The Way?The Way can be used as a transformative guide to improve your life or as a life reference where you can find information to help you manage a specific issue you are dealing with.Transformative Guide: All three volumes of The Way are designed to change you in positive ways through merely understanding the message. Here you simply read or listen to the books and then follow the instructions going as far as you desire at the speed of your choosing.Life Reference: The Way, Life Manual, and Child & Family Guide are designed as a quick reference book that you can use anytime. Within these books, you find the details and lists that you will need at different times of life. In this way, once you understand the 7 Steps and the layout of the manual and guide, you can jump to crucial sections when you and yours are in need. Testimonials & EndorsementsAt this time, The Way is in editing and will be published soon. So this means we only have limited feedback. However, the feedback received was credible and shows the great promise of the book. Below are a sample of testimonials from those who have read advanced copies.A 15-year-old read it and told me, “This is exactly what I needed.” to a 95-year-old woman who said, “This is one of those books that needs to be published for the sake of humanity.” to a young mother who said, “I wish I had this information before I gave birth.” to a mid-thirties professional male who said, “This is like the wisdom of the ages in one book!” to a mid-thirties professional woman who said, “This is the kind of book you read and then keep in easy reach for there is so much goodness to reflect on I want to read it again and again” to a twenty-something woman who said, ""Everyone needs to know this, we are just not taught this stuff but should be, this needs to be a movement!""After a professional review of the manuscript by a published author, I received this comment, ""I say that you have everything you need, first and foremost, because of your writing. It’s commercial and intelligent. It’s unique. And you have an engaging writing style. You’re also bringing something new, valuable, and marketable to your category, and I like that your work explores meaningful themes. Not every book has to “matter” but I prefer that type of book (and author). In addition, your marketing background makes it much more likely you’ll get where you want to go. In short, you have a lot to be optimistic about, and lastly, I like that you’re coachable and committed and have a sense of humor (the longer I do this, the more I pay attention to those things, too).”One of my publishers, who has read hundreds of self-help, self-development, and success books as well as publishes them, found great wisdom within The Way that he had not found anywhere else, and this helped them through a very challenging life event.A Hollywood type said, ""Wow, this is like the Rocky Story plus The Secret on Steroids!There is something for everyone within The Way. This can’t be said for most books, and that’s the point. The Way is not like most books. It’s as one of my publishers said after he and others reviewed The Way. “We have never seen anything like this, as most self-help and success type books are all just regurgitation of past work of people like Covey and Robbins. This is truly original and mind-blowing. It could change everything!”Some have called it ""The Handbook for Humanity."" The Way Is NeededNow More Than EverWe need only to pick up a newspaper or turn on the news to see the negativity that is rising around the world. The negativity and wrongness of the world are clearly evident. What is even more evident is that people are rising up and clamoring for real practical positive solutions all around the world. Our connectedness has helped us all become more aware of our similarities as well as our growing global power to create positive change.The questions answered within The Way can be seen as a formula that once input into a human and our society, the code will affect positive change from within. The Way is a catalyst and codified in a way that focuses and moves us in positive directions. The Way is a complete solution that will save us time and help us become better people, improve our relationships, and help create a better society. It not only includes all the information and implementation strategies but also charts, lists, and examples that can be customized to create a plan that fits your life. So far, all who understand The Way have said this is needed more than ever. One need only start reading to understand why. About The AuthorAndrew was born in Detroit, Michigan, USA, on March 18, 1966. He is not someone that you would have expected to write a book. He was born with a lazy eye, which made him legally blind in one eye. As a result, he wore a patch over his good eye to improve his vision. He has dyslexia and other “learning disabilities,” so he struggled with reading, writing, and arithmetic. Little was known about “learning disabilities” at the time, so learning and adapting to life’s challenges at an early age was difficult.Along with these issues, he was also bullied by his peers and adults, with one elementary school teacher even going as far as to ridicule him in front of the class, telling him to drop out of school and get a job because he was too stupid to ever graduate.He learned to compensate and even became an avid reader and listener to books with a lot of extra effort on his part, the support of his mother, sister, a special teacher, and aid from services for the blind and handicapped. It's important to note that along with these “learning challenges” came some great gifts that allowed him to do and see things others could not. He has always been a very spiritual person with a special connection to nature.He went on to not only graduate from high school as the Vice President of the student body but went on to earn a BA in Speech and Communications as well as minors in Religious Studies and Eastern Philosophy. After graduation, he then spent a few years teaching English in Japan and traveling the world, which enhanced his knowledge before returning to the USA.Throughout his life, Andrew has always worked hard. He was forced into it because of his learning disabilities, but he also likes doing a good job even if no one will see or know about it. Andrew has won many accolades throughout his career and is known as an innovator, an out of the box thinker, and someone who gets the job done. He started working when he was very young by doing odd jobs and selling things for money or trade. For example, in elementary school, he created a little business selling collectibles he got from the ice cream man that got so popular the principal called his parents to shut it down because it was taking all the other children’s lunch money.At various times he was a paperboy, lifeguard, swimming teacher, gas station attendant, construction worker, stock boy, cashier, appliance repairman, handyman, gardener, janitor, dishwasher, landscaper, food server, personal trainer, security guard/bouncer, martial arts and self-defense teacher, cook, furniture mover, teleprompter operator, teacher, salesman, sales manager, IT manager, recruiter, recruiter manager, marketer, trainer, public speaker, business partner, business owner, startup developer, website programmer, internet marketing and SEO expert, founder, owner and CEO of Consulting Ace Inc. since 1999, and now the author of The Way and the founder of The 7th Foundation.Andrew has always been very healthy and fit and is what many would call a health and fitness fanatic. He stopped eating all forms of junk food, by choice, at 13 years old after learning about the benefits of real food compared to the harmful effects of junk food. Since then, he has studied all facets of food, health, the human body, mind, longevity, and ways to train and repair ourselves.He participated in sports while in school, including track, cross-country, basketball, and crew (rowing team). He has competed in triathlons, is an expert swimmer, mountain biker, and yoga practitioner, as well as earned degrees in many forms of martial arts.Andrew was also forced to learn even more profound lessons of the body and mind as he was injured seriously many times in life. While some of these injuries left him with permanent issues, today, few people could recognize any physical limitations aside from the inability to sit in one place for too long.There is so much more to Andrew as he has lived quite the adventurous life and has had many nail-biting and mind-blowing experiences. It would take a whole book even to begin to tell his story correctly. You will also learn a little more about him in the first chapter of The Way.Hopefully, the little taste we have given you here is enough to see that while most people would not have picked Andrew as someone who should write a book, knowing his life and his knowledge base, Andrew is definitely someone we want doing so. “Learning Disabilities” Note: What society has negatively labeled as “Learning Disabilities” are really just “Learning Differences” and alternative ways of thinking that often come with great gifts. This simply means, in most cases, the cookie-cutter teaching methods that work for most everyone, just need to be altered to reach these people. If we can master educating this group, it will help our society, for many, if not most, of our greatest achievers and thinkers, have one or more of these issues. Some of whom include: George Washington, Leonardo da Vinci, Alexander Graham Bell, Thomas Edison, Albert Einstein, George Patton, Winston Churchill, Henry Ford, Walt Disney, Pablo Picasso, Ludwig van Beethoven, Alexander Graham Bell, John F. Kennedy, Dr. Temple Grandin, Daymond John, Gavin Newsom, Cher, Agatha Christie, Woopie Goldberg, Steve Jobs, Erin Brockovich, Keira Knightley, W.B. Yeats, Keanu Reeves, Jay Leno, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Tom Cruise, John Lennon, Muhammad Ali, Tommy Hilfiger, Richard Branson, and Elon Musk. More Than Just a BookIt's Our MissionThe 7th FoundationWe are not only releasing the books and all the supporting materials but also starting a foundation and movement.Our mission is to be a catalyst that spurs meaningful positive change within people's lives and our society in order to create a world of lasting peace and happiness that everyone can enjoy.Our motto is “All for one, one for all, united we stand, divided we fall!” which we have borrowed from The Musketeers.The 7th Foundation is dedicated to spreading the messages found within The Way and helping the founder with his great mission.

<h3>Pre-orders for Doors of Love and Light Auracle card deck.</h3>
<p>This Doors of Love and Light Auracle Card Deck Project and the Doors of Love and Light Healing Meditations book are designed to bring the energy healing I have learned, to you, through sacred geometry images and energy healing meditations.</p>
<p><strong>My Story:</strong> My name is Rita Morgin and I can help you engage the guardians of your land to heal past trauma and clear old energies so you can experience a return to joy and realize your true mission.</p>
<p>Seven years ago I started noticing the effects of adrenal fatigue. This was a big wake up call for me, and I gave up those jobs that were draining my life to begin a process of creatively coming back to spirit. I created my art studio with an Indiegogo funding  ""I Make Gardens Sing"" campaign.</p>
<p>Through creating pieces of <strong>Magical Garden Art</strong> that open doors to love, light and care for myself and others, I rediscovered friends I had abandoned years ago: The Guardians of the Land.</p>
<p>What the guardians told me was that they’ve been waiting for me to ask for their help in returning my body and my life back to balance. They reminded me that they reside in all the spaces of life: the land, your home, your work, and even online spaces like websites. They want to partner with me and others to create greater balance, harmony and joy.</p>
<p>While I thought I was a ""magical garden artist"", I transformed into a healer, beginning with myself. Using energy healing to Harmonize energy in my living and working spaces has brought me new found joy and wellness.</p>
<p>As I worked with my  guardians, I noticed that I could help others to connect with and engage the guardians of their land and spaces to achieve the great results with LAND Healing (Light Aligned Nourishes Dreams Healing).</p>
<p>I have come to the conclusion that each of us has our own unique modality inside of us; AND my greatest joy is assisting others to discover that unique ability and fine tune it.</p>
<p>I have maxed out my credit cards to publish this book and card deck so that I may offer it to you and your spaces. During this process I have experienced a broken arm and loss of home due to inability to work as my arm healed, Corona virus shutdowns and limited work.</p>
<p>I am now well, able to work, and desperately desire to clear this debt.  Your support will not only help me get back on my feet, but will help share this New LAND (Light Aligned Nourishes Dreams) Healing modality for creating harmony in your spaces.</p>
<p>Please join me in financing pre-orders for <strong>Doors of Love and Light Auracle card deck</strong> by Rita Morgin, Artist, Author, LAND Healer</p>
<p>I was Scheduled to publish on April 4th 2020.  And this date was pushed out due to Corona virus limitations and a backlog of printing orders in the USA.</p>
<p><strong>About the Auracle Cards and Meditation Book</strong>:</p>
<p>""Clear your spaces and your personal energy with these messages of love and light. Bring the healing energy required to the spaces in need: in your home, your work, yourself and all the spaces of your ancestors…… </p>
<p>Each card is a door into your greater awareness of joy, peace and calm.</p>
<p>Some doors invite you to clear your environment: the places you live and work, your ancestral lineage, the spaces you travel through in your daily living; Some doors invite you to journey inward to discover your whole being and the message of your heart; Other doors invite you to care for both spaces at the same time.</p>
<p>This is not a Tarot deck or Future telling. This Auracle card deck provides an exploration in awakening to your intuition. “Auracle” instead of “Oracle” because you are invited to hear (auricle) your own intuition, rather than be told (oracle) what you need to know. </p>
<p>Each of us has intuitional access to all of the information in the universe. The Doors of Love and Light Auracle Card deck supports your journey to clearing, balancing, harmonizing, welcoming and energizing this intuition in support of your wellbeing on your journey to create your most joy-filled life.</p>

<p>Des fous, qui ont beaucoup travaillé en presse musicale, et qui ont dirigé pendant plus d'une décennie la rédaction de magazines comme <i>Guitar Part, Rock Wanted, Rock First</i> et bien d'autres, avant de décider que l'aventure d'un magazine indépendant, exigeant et qui ne ressemblerait pas à un catalogue de pub, ça se tentait. Alors on l'a tentée.</p>
<p>Et on est devenus éditeurs indépendants, il y a un peu plus de 4 ans, de <strong>Rockawa</strong>, le magazine qu'on avait toujours voulu lire.

Des fous, qui ont beaucoup travaillé en presse musicale, et qui ont dirigé pendant plus d'une décennie la rédaction de magazines comme Guitar Part, Rock Wanted, Rock First et bien d'autres, avant de décider que l'aventure d'un magazine indépendant, exigeant et qui ne ressemblerait pas à un catalogue de pub, ça se tentait. Alors on l'a tentée.
Et on est devenus éditeurs indépendants, il y a un peu plus de 4 ans, de Rockawa, le magazine qu'on avait toujours voulu lire. Tiré à 5.000 exemplaires, pas disponible en kiosques mais seulement via www.rockawa.com, il n'est jamais frappé d'obsolescence puisqu'il étudie de fond en comble, à grand renfort d'anecdotes et de rubriques épatantes, la grande histoire du rock, décennie après décennie, des années 1950 à nos jours. 

 Le 1er numéro paraît en octobre 2013. On tremble, on se dit qu'on est malades de lancer un magazine au moment où la presse musicale est en plein marasme.
 Surprise, tout s'enchaîne, on a des lecteurs militants formidables, qui nous soutiennent sans relâche. On lance l'abonnement sur le volume 9, un an et demi après les débuts.
Aujourd'hui, on prépare le volume 25 (sortie début janvier 2018). On a une super-application mobile qui permet de rester connecté à Rockawa tous les jours, un chouette site (www.rockawa.com) où on peut vendre des anciens numéros, des podcasts, des t-shirts, etc.

Mais Rockawa n'est fait que par un très petit nombre de personnes, et a des coûts incompressibles (imprimerie, droits photographiques, coûts postaux qui grimpent d'année en année et que nous refusons de répercuter trop largement sur nos lecteurs…).
Au départ, pour être franc, on ne se voyait pas aussi loin… Pourtant, on s'est pris au jeu. Mais aujourd'hui, si Rockawa est toujours là et bat fièrement le pavillon du rock, il ne peut pas pour autant ""voir plus loin"" qu'un, voire deux numéros. Tous les bénéfices générés par les abonnements servent aux frais de fonctionnement et sont directement réinvestis dans l'aventure. Et à l'exception des prestataires inévitables (imprimerie, droits photos, frais postaux), aucun des contributeurs, tant pour la rédaction que la maquette ou la partie administrative, n'est aujourd'hui rémunéré pour réaliser le magazine.

<p><strong>A little about me!</strong></p>
<p>I was born and raised in the city of San Francisco.  When I became a first time mom, I really had no clue.  Often as brand new moms we’re just trying to make it.  We just Created A Human.   That little human used our body as a house for 9 months. Let that sink in....Nothing short of a miracle!</p>
<p>When I first became a new mom, I wished there were an all encompassing book out there to guide me through the incredible, yet challenging journey called motherhood.  I needed that book more then ever when I became a single mom.  Alas, there wasn't one, and I just could not leave parenting to chance.  So, I began reading, researching, talking to thriving moms and experts , learning from the successes and pitfalls of moms, including my own experiences, which included things we would change, and so much more....</p>
<p>As time moved along friends and family would constantly ask me, how I do it all?  Why do I seem so happy?  How do I have time and energy to do the things I love?  How can I afford that?  I wanted to share it all, beyond my friends.

<p>We are a team of husband and wife, who have been in the publishing industry for more than ten years, as we use our finance and technical engineering background to reinforce our presence.</p>
<p>We have spent the past five years establishing two platforms for indie-authors.</p>
<p>One in Turkey, which brought the concept of “indie-author” along with the POD to the country, providing an option to the authors to be free from a handful large publishers (similar to the United States.)</p>
<p>...and another one in the United States with the same mission to free indie-authors from being captives of one (particular) company.</p>

</div></div>","The newly created BOOK SELFIE is an alternate online channel for self-publishing authors to sell their books and expand their reach to many more readers, where booklovers can buy and read books without the interference of a forceful algorithm.

 



Easily upload your eBooks and print books, and upload your icon and header to create your online e-Bookstore.
 

We all know the cost of the book is lower in bulk, and we have developed our site accordingly. You can sell your print books that you have in your stock, and send them directly to the booklovers.

 

You want to put your best foot forward? Yes you can, on Book Selfie. Upload your 3D book covers as your showcase to have a better looking bookstore.

 

Not only 3D book covers, you can also upload extra images to prim up your books to enhance your sales.


 


They are your books and you are in control of the pricing. We don’t tell you the minimum price. You do your own calculations and price them out at your will. No problem! 
Do you want to be in the middle of the herd, where the big company has special deals with the large publishers, or even a publisher itself?
This is one of the main breaks that we are offering to the indie-author... to be really “indie”.  
There are no ads to push any books to the top, reviews don’t push books to the top, there are no biases, and there are no influencers.
It is an equal opportunity environment, where everybody is on the same playing field.


 

Really simple. Since our platform is subscription based, it is really simple to sell your eBooks. Someone downloads your eBook you get paid a certain amount. There are no complicated calculations of %35, %70, etc...

 



Book Selfie is a subscription based platform, where you can read unlimited  eBooks on our free app with a valid subscription.

 

Download your eBooks, the rest is not a problem. On the plane, on the metro rail… you still have access to your eBooks anywhere even if there is no internet connection.

 

Directly supporting the creators of the books is important for us. When you purchase a print book, you purchase it directly from the indie-author.

 

Not only you have access to eBooks, you can also use our app to purchase print books anywhere, anytime.

 

You don’t even have to buy expensive devices to be able to highlight and bookmark your eBook. Just bookmark any page or highlight anything with different colors and go back later. Never miss a page, important paragraph, or even a word.

 

Purchase print books and eBook subscriptions from Book Selfie with a clear conscious that your money is not going to the big company to have a stronger grip on the book market to have a deeper control.
 

We do not track your buying habits, we do not keep records of your search habits. We respect your privacy!
 

No tagging, no cross selling, no upselling, no down selling… just print books and eBooks… just indie-authors and booklovers. That’s all!
 

No, we don’t assess your buying habits, or keep track of your purchases to push books on you. You will see exactly what you are looking for.
 

Everybody enjoys high quality books. It is our mission to create a mutually exclusive environment, where indie-authors get what they highly deserve in fairness to gratify the booklovers with what they deserve.
In order to accomplish our task, and our mission, we have spent innumerable hours making plans and sweating the details… and now we need your support to take it further!
 
We are asking for $50,000.00 for the following planned tasks:

Increase our presence to reach more indie-authors
Implement audiobook functionality to our app
Improve and upgrade our platform
Redesign and improve our app
Create a support team for indie-authors

 


We are a team of husband and wife, who have been in the publishing industry for more than ten years, as we use our finance and technical engineering background to reinforce our presence.
We have spent the past five years establishing two platforms for indie-authors.
One in Turkey, which brought the concept of “indie-author” along with the POD to the country, providing an option to the authors to be free from a handful large publishers (similar to the United States.)
...and another one in the United States with the same mission to free indie-authors from being captives of one (particular) company.
Our goal - our vision is to become a disruptive force in the publishing industry to bring fairness and tangible solutions to the authors.
 

We believe indie-authors are the driving force, and booklovers are the beneficiaries from their creations. We, in Book Selfie, are simply the medium to bring them together on our platform. On that note, “being relentless” would be the basis of our mission as to make progress and bring fairness to the publishing industry by putting these two worlds together.

<h2><strong>Book Two: It Got Back To The Wrong People</strong></h2>
<p>This book, which its genesis is an offshoot of Breakthrough Measures, examines how  digital technology &amp; media combined with social behavior influences our collective means for expressing opinions and responding to comments.  The impacts are widespread, from marketers whose brands now encounter people's values in their efforts, to  the everyday person, culminating in the aftermath of the 2016 US election.   </p>
<p>People are interested in dialogue as long as it is meaningful.  The book can help foster that dialogue.</p>
<p><i>People </i>features an overview of how media and shifting public usage of technology connects to  communication and social issues offline.  The first chapters explain the digital influences. The second set shows examples within the arts and politics, as well as various cultures.  The last chapters provide context, tips to discern issues, and recommendations on what to do. Anyone who reads it will learn, reflect, and enjoy the ideas to communicate effectively.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Chapter 1  Big Mouth: A Brief History of How “It"" Got Back To You</strong> Starting with an examination of a comment from Bill Cosby on his 2004 NAACP awards speech - nicknamed the ""Pound Cake” speech - this chapter looks at some of the social issues and public events that have been impacted when exposed online.  The chapter offers thoughts of how our comments on issues are observational, but leave out an examination of causal effects - and how such instances impacts communication and context surround social media online.  This chapter will note well-known discussions in media, from entertainment, business, and government (which will also serve into the first few chapters as well).</li>
<li>
<strong>Chapter 2  ""The Media” Reflects On You</strong> This chapter notes the history of the new broadcasts from the pre-cable days to now, and how our collective understanding of information has changed.  People have the impression that the media is biased and unfair, but shifts in how information is presented means that it can be a mirror to ourselves rather than a collective, shared understanding. Media may be acting more as a mirror, just like the internet. This chapter ultimately will look at how our communication and everyday judgement have been impacted.   <strong>Example:  </strong>The media may be acting more as a mirror, similar to the internet  (Filter Bubble advocated by Eli Pariser,  Pop news coverage over the years (Michael Jackson, OJ Simpson trial) influencing coverage, consolidation of news media sources ); Fake news is forcing social media platforms to better police their content.</li>
<li>
<strong>Chapter 3  Wade in the Social Media Water: Our Community Online</strong>  This chapter examines the rise of social media and how it - and the commercialism that embraced it first - has becomes influential in how we communicate.   The chapter name is a variation of the old Negro spiritual ""Wade In The Water"", meant in this instance as a metaphor for how people wade in the ""waters of information” — at different banks, different time of day, and for different purposes.  Therefore our experiences become a number of opinions with varying degrees of communication skills that can hard to discern online. <strong> Example Thought: </strong>  Everyone can offer their opinion on social media, but that opinion can spread. That can be dangerous for small businesses (Memories Pizza in Indiana, Amy Baking Company in Arizona) and individuals (#CecilTheLion)</li>
<li>
<strong>Chapter 4  Everything Sticks: How Technology Can Change The Scope of Our Common Sense and Ethics</strong> The character Selina Kyle/Catwoman, as portrayed by Anne Hathaway in <i>The Dark Knight Rises</i>, once complained that starting fresh in life is hard because ""everything sticks"". This chapter will take a look at how various everyday tech - from our devices to analytics- can correlate information, but a key influencer, the data being examined, shifts separately of common sense and intuition. decisions.  For people and issues that are considered “data” in a debate, pitfalls appear when we have issues communicated through technology and media. <strong>Example Thought:</strong> People can be more analytical about their lives - their health, their choices in how they spend their money, map places they need to go. But the capability does not mean life is better for everyone.  The work behind a benefit has to be done to achieve a benefit from what is being measured.</li>
<li>
<strong>Chapter 5  Asymmetric Truth: When Online Opinions Become Our Real Thoughts In Life</strong> Communication can create perceived correlations when there is more to it, but what we convey online does not always reveal offline influences. This chapter will cover how asymmetric information can develop, and how our opinions become facts when all the facts are not presented.  Twitter usage will be among the topics examined, as are examples of how social issues are rooted in asymmetric experiences for various people.  The chapter will also speak to how we process information in specific and diffuse ways, with a theme that we must seek information where possible. </li>
<li><p><strong>Chapter 6  Culture: How We Identify Ourselves </strong>  How we see ourselves influences how we communicate to the world. This chapter will examine how culture influence us as individuals, and how that shapes our discussions online. Notes about how personal experience, faith, psychology, and cultural issues such as women’s rights influence how we express our ideas online will be included.  <strong>Examples:</strong> Hashtag campaigns for women's issues in professional careers are examined — #ILookLikeAnEngineer,  #gamergate </p></li>
<li>
<strong>Chapter 7 Art: When We Dream of Life (and Life Becomes A Dream)</strong> The chapter examines instances in Art and Entertainment regarding how we express ourselves online. </li>
<li>
<strong>Chapter 8  Politics: The Art of Deciding Our Values, Our Fate, and Our Voice </strong>Examples in politics and activism regarding how we communicate online - why our debates need varied voices to make progress, and an examination of social bottlenecks to communication.</li>
<li>
<strong>Chapter 9  Passing Knowledge: Organizing How You Listen, Explain, and Share Ideas</strong> Tips on how to assess the media you ingest online and how to review content for misleading or limited information.  Some tips will be based on analytic practices and will include social media platforms to help people select tools to appreciate the groups they choose to associate with online.</li>
<li>
<strong>Chapter 10 In a Crowd Alone: Being Aware of How We Relate to People</strong>  Tips on how to to deal with people with our devices and behavior. We are always communicating, just like our devices - when do we to know when we are dealing with people in a straightforward manner.   </li>
<li>
<strong>Chapter 11 What to Keep In Mind When Advocating </strong> - Tips on what to look for when giving your message (and for marketers, small businesses, and nonprofits, how to look at context &amp; metrics with a message).</li>
<li>
<strong>Chapter 12  Never Throw Rocks And Hide Your Hands: How To Debate and Discuss Safely</strong> - Educate yourself on communicating safely online - what to look for from individuals online and off - the character and quality of posted material must align to be truthful.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Why these books are important</strong></h3>
<p>These books are important to me as way to engage people on seemingly different topics that are yet related ideas - much of analytics is related to context and communication online.  <strong>Breakthrough Measures</strong> will cover best practice in analysis, while  <strong>It Got Back To The Wrong People</strong> offers people a way to vet the ideas that they encounter online and choose to discuss.  </p>
<p>I wanted to introduce books that could benefits others through some best practices from my experiences and maybe shift debates so that people can have better conversations.   I've incorporated aspects of these experiences in my marketing presentations, but I  wanted a more dedicated platform to talk about best practices.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Details on what the funds will go towards</h3>
<p>Ok folks, here's the details on how the funds will be used.</p>
<ul>
<li>The books will be published via Bookbaby.</li>
<li>Perks are the books themselves, plus opportunities for workshops to be donated to a group of your choosing.  </li>
<li>Funds will cover book expenses (through Bookbaby - roughly $1200 to cover an initial run of 200 books), an editor to help review both books (est $1500/each), a designer who is starting work on the book covers ($400/each), two banners for conferences ($500/each), a dedicated website for the books (est $300), and marketing via paid search marketing via Linked In, Facebook, and Adwords.</li>
<li>The funds will also allow a dedicated budget for marketing the books consistently through 2017 and into 2018.  </li>
</ul>
<p>There are Zimana funds earmarked for the project as well. Another Zimana product, an analytics app, is well underway. It will provide small businesses another way to manage expenses accurately, based on analytics.</p>
<p>Another issue, albeit personal, is the replacement of the ""company car""  (The current car is a nearly 16 year old Ford Focus with over 233,000 miles as of this writing - vehicle was kept during graduate school, working, and while starting Zimana 8 years ago to keep start up costs low.  New speaking opportunities that require travel is now driving up wear and the need to replace it).</p>
<p>Thus any support for this project would be well appreciated, because additional resources can be used to help complete several tasks with more financial ease and ensuring better quality on the books!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Your Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will make a difference in two major ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The world needs a communication book to help it understand how fake news and continual digital communication has altered trust among people, and to take action on making it better. It Got Back To The Wrong People will help folks. </li>
<li>Small and medium size businesses need an up-to-date marketing analytics book, and it has been awhile since such a book has been on the market.  Breakthrough Measures will deliver a solid book that will help businesses compete cost-effectively to develop digital budgets.  As options become more complex, a simple guide is needed. Breakthrough Measures is that guide.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a really great business background  - I included video so you can see and hear me, as well as to get to know me professionally.  I am also uploading a few images that reflect the past work I have accomplished, so you know that this project's milestones will be delivered.  </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Right now the only key risk is managing time well through this year. 3 workshops are already scheduled, so I have to prepare those.  I am also working with a few clients and conducting developer work on an app that will create complementary services.  But the book project will be a success for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have worked under pressure before, so dedicate focus is at the core of this project from the start.  I am adding communication tools (Slack, Evernote) to be efficient. Evernote is used to speed up the time it takes to do the dictation and refine the text.  Slack will be used with the designer to manage the book.</li>
<li>I have experience not only writing but in editing,  I have been an associate editor of business book reviews for Small Business Trends, so I know what goes into a nonfiction and business book. I have also been a technical editor for two Pearson/Que publications, and consulted on books authored by Ramon Ray (The Small Business Guide To Facebook Marketing) and Marcus Hammonds ( God, Technology, and Us).</li>
<li>There are podcast opportunities ahead, and I will be presenting at three conferences where I can build interest for the books.</li>
<li>I also have support from the sites who I have contributed over the last 5 years. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Donate a Pierre-Can-Help</h3>
<p>You can donate this perk to a favorite non-profit or a small business of your choice (no Mulit-Level Marketing businesses). I am more than happy to provide a tailored workshop to explain a social media platform.  This is a $250 value for $65, so you are really receiving a good deal for this perk!</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you just can't contribute, you can help by sharing where possible.  Getting the word out gives feedback and offers new ideas, so sharing is certainly welcome.</p>

Chapter 2  ""The Media” Reflects On You This chapter notes the history of the new broadcasts from the pre-cable days to now, and how our collective understanding of information has changed.  People have the impression that the media is biased and unfair, but shifts in how information is presented means that it can be a mirror to ourselves rather than a collective, shared understanding. Media may be acting more as a mirror, just like the internet. This chapter ultimately will look at how our communication and everyday judgement have been impacted.   Example:  The media may be acting more as a mirror, similar to the internet  (Filter Bubble advocated by Eli Pariser,  Pop news coverage over the years (Michael Jackson, OJ Simpson trial) influencing coverage, consolidation of news media sources ); Fake news is forcing social media platforms to better police their content.

Chapter 3  Wade in the Social Media Water: Our Community Online  This chapter examines the rise of social media and how it - and the commercialism that embraced it first - has becomes influential in how we communicate.   The chapter name is a variation of the old Negro spiritual ""Wade In The Water"", meant in this instance as a metaphor for how people wade in the ""waters of information” — at different banks, different time of day, and for different purposes.  Therefore our experiences become a number of opinions with varying degrees of communication skills that can hard to discern online.  Example Thought:   Everyone can offer their opinion on social media, but that opinion can spread. That can be dangerous for small businesses (Memories Pizza in Indiana, Amy Baking Company in Arizona) and individuals (#CecilTheLion)

Chapter 4  Everything Sticks: How Technology Can Change The Scope of Our Common Sense and Ethics The character Selina Kyle/Catwoman, as portrayed by Anne Hathaway in The Dark Knight Rises, once complained that starting fresh in life is hard because ""everything sticks"". This chapter will take a look at how various everyday tech - from our devices to analytics- can correlate information, but a key influencer, the data being examined, shifts separately of common sense and intuition. decisions.  For people and issues that are considered “data” in a debate, pitfalls appear when we have issues communicated through technology and media. Example Thought: People can be more analytical about their lives - their health, their choices in how they spend their money, map places they need to go. But the capability does not mean life is better for everyone.  The work behind a benefit has to be done to achieve a benefit from what is being measured.

Chapter 5  Asymmetric Truth: When Online Opinions Become Our Real Thoughts In Life Communication can create perceived correlations when there is more to it, but what we convey online does not always reveal offline influences. This chapter will cover how asymmetric information can develop, and how our opinions become facts when all the facts are not presented.  Twitter usage will be among the topics examined, as are examples of how social issues are rooted in asymmetric experiences for various people.  The chapter will also speak to how we process information in specific and diffuse ways, with a theme that we must seek information where possible. 
Chapter 6  Culture: How We Identify Ourselves   How we see ourselves influences how we communicate to the world. This chapter will examine how culture influence us as individuals, and how that shapes our discussions online. Notes about how personal experience, faith, psychology, and cultural issues such as women’s rights influence how we express our ideas online will be included.  Examples: Hashtag campaigns for women's issues in professional careers are examined — #ILookLikeAnEngineer,  #gamergate 

Chapter 7 Art: When We Dream of Life (and Life Becomes A Dream) The chapter examines instances in Art and Entertainment regarding how we express ourselves online. 

Chapter 8  Politics: The Art of Deciding Our Values, Our Fate, and Our Voice Examples in politics and activism regarding how we communicate online - why our debates need varied voices to make progress, and an examination of social bottlenecks to communication.

Chapter 9  Passing Knowledge: Organizing How You Listen, Explain, and Share Ideas Tips on how to assess the media you ingest online and how to review content for misleading or limited information.  Some tips will be based on analytic practices and will include social media platforms to help people select tools to appreciate the groups they choose to associate with online.

Chapter 10 In a Crowd Alone: Being Aware of How We Relate to People  Tips on how to to deal with people with our devices and behavior. We are always communicating, just like our devices - when do we to know when we are dealing with people in a straightforward manner.   

Chapter 11 What to Keep In Mind When Advocating  - Tips on what to look for when giving your message (and for marketers, small businesses, and nonprofits, how to look at context & metrics with a message).

Chapter 12  Never Throw Rocks And Hide Your Hands: How To Debate and Discuss Safely - Educate yourself on communicating safely online - what to look for from individuals online and off - the character and quality of posted material must align to be truthful.

Why these books are important
These books are important to me as way to engage people on seemingly different topics that are yet related ideas - much of analytics is related to context and communication online.  Breakthrough Measures will cover best practice in analysis, while  It Got Back To The Wrong People offers people a way to vet the ideas that they encounter online and choose to discuss.  
I wanted to introduce books that could benefits others through some best practices from my experiences and maybe shift debates so that people can have better conversations.   I've incorporated aspects of these experiences in my marketing presentations, but I  wanted a more dedicated platform to talk about best practices.

Details on what the funds will go towards
Ok folks, here's the details on how the funds will be used.

The books will be published via Bookbaby.
Perks are the books themselves, plus opportunities for workshops to be donated to a group of your choosing.  
Funds will cover book expenses (through Bookbaby - roughly $1200 to cover an initial run of 200 books), an editor to help review both books (est $1500/each), a designer who is starting work on the book covers ($400/each), two banners for conferences ($500/each), a dedicated website for the books (est $300), and marketing via paid search marketing via Linked In, Facebook, and Adwords.
The funds will also allow a dedicated budget for marketing the books consistently through 2017 and into 2018.  

There are Zimana funds earmarked for the project as well. Another Zimana product, an analytics app, is well underway. It will provide small businesses another way to manage expenses accurately, based on analytics.
Another issue, albeit personal, is the replacement of the ""company car""  (The current car is a nearly 16 year old Ford Focus with over 233,000 miles as of this writing - vehicle was kept during graduate school, working, and while starting Zimana 8 years ago to keep start up costs low.  New speaking opportunities that require travel is now driving up wear and the need to replace it).
Thus any support for this project would be well appreciated, because additional resources can be used to help complete several tasks with more financial ease and ensuring better quality on the books!

Your Impact
Your contribution will make a difference in two major ways:

The world needs a communication book to help it understand how fake news and continual digital communication has altered trust among people, and to take action on making it better. It Got Back To The Wrong People will help folks. 
Small and medium size businesses need an up-to-date marketing analytics book, and it has been awhile since such a book has been on the market.  Breakthrough Measures will deliver a solid book that will help businesses compete cost-effectively to develop digital budgets.  As options become more complex, a simple guide is needed. Breakthrough Measures is that guide.

I have a really great business background  - I included video so you can see and hear me, as well as to get to know me professionally.  I am also uploading a few images that reflect the past work I have accomplished, so you know that this project's milestones will be delivered.  
 

Risks & Challenges
Right now the only key risk is managing time well through this year. 3 workshops are already scheduled, so I have to prepare those.  I am also working with a few clients and conducting developer work on an app that will create complementary services.  But the book project will be a success for several reasons:

I have worked under pressure before, so dedicate focus is at the core of this project from the start.  I am adding communication tools (Slack, Evernote) to be efficient. Evernote is used to speed up the time it takes to do the dictation and refine the text.  Slack will be used with the designer to manage the book.
I have experience not only writing but in editing,  I have been an associate editor of business book reviews for Small Business Trends, so I know what goes into a nonfiction and business book. I have also been a technical editor for two Pearson/Que publications, and consulted on books authored by Ramon Ray (The Small Business Guide To Facebook Marketing) and Marcus Hammonds ( God, Technology, and Us).
There are podcast opportunities ahead, and I will be presenting at three conferences where I can build interest for the books.
I also have support from the sites who I have contributed over the last 5 years. 


Donate a Pierre-Can-Help
You can donate this perk to a favorite non-profit or a small business of your choice (no Mulit-Level Marketing businesses). I am more than happy to provide a tailored workshop to explain a social media platform.  This is a $250 value for $65, so you are really receiving a good deal for this perk!
Other Ways You Can Help
If you just can't contribute, you can help by sharing where possible.  Getting the word out gives feedback and offers new ideas, so sharing is certainly welcome.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>DIY Publishing </h3>
<p>My idea for a DIY publishing company started six years ago. My first story was written from a dream when I awoke from an afternoon nap. This story was just pen on paper until a friend motivated me to share it. The inspiration to create ZoZo Children's Publishing came when I left the United States to travel. Yes, it was the experience of traveling through countries and meeting wonderful artists and writers who felt they did not have a platform for their work that ZoZo Children's Publishing was born. </p>
<h1>ZoZo</h1>
<p>The ZoZo came from a nickname for the youngest in my family, my niece Zoie. Her grandfather has given her the funny moniker of ZoZo, but my twin brother does not seem to like it very much. So to immortalize this family memory, I have named the company ZoZo Children's Publishing. </p>
<p>The idea to self publish my own work and others did not just come from an overabundance of stories and art to share with the world. It also came from a past full of high hurdles jumped and hard goals accomplished. In the 80's, at school, it seemed there was no room for someone that did not read at a certain level. The problem continues today with large class sizes and regulated timed tests that leave some children grasping at straws. I was one of these kids- slipping through the cracks. How does a child with dyslexia make it through elementary school? I learned to fake it. That is right, I tricked my teachers and would pretend to read. This went unseen for a long time. Then when called on one to many times in the 4th grade to read in front of the class I new the ""jig was up."" They put me in a reading class. Only then did my eyes start to open to the world of reading and how reading can bring the rest of the world to you. </p>
<p>Even though this was not that long ago, with the changes in technology, the world  is a very different place now. We all had to turn the TV channel with a nob and make phone calls to homes, not pockets. Now people can fast forward TV, and kids read books with a swipe of a finger. This might make teaching reading a lot easier, or it may make it even harder. Teaching kids that reading a webpage like this one is not the same as a ""classic"" starts at the basic level, as does a small company like this one. </p>

These plans are created to maximize awareness of the book within the budget provided. As a small press, our marketing budget is small and sadly, the most effective marketing efforts tend to be more expensive. 
Funds from this project will be used to supplement the plan, allowing for promotion outside the standard plan. 
For example, on-screen cinema advertising can be very effective when tied to personal appearances. But the cost of these ads can exceed our overall marketing budget for the book. Remember, we're small. 
Why should you help us?  This is an obvious question and it's a hard one. The technological changes of the past decade or so have allowed for more authors to publish their work. As a result the marketplace is crowded. A way to be seen inside that crowd is through marketing. You or someone you know is probably familiar with Rock Neelly (the author) or Post Mortem Press (the publisher). Often people will offer assistance. ""Let me know if there's anything I can do to help"" is a familiar refrain. The best way to help an author is to buy their book and tell people about once you've finished reading it. This campaign allows you to purchase your book in advance and slipping in a little extra to help cover that marketing campaign. Plus, you get your name in a book and can prove you actually did know about Rock Neelly before he was famous, or is that infamous?    What's in it for you? 
We've designed a unique group of perks to show our appreciation to those who are able to help us with this modest project.

</div></div>","SHORT SUMMARY 



COMANY: Tayen Lane Publishing was founded in 2012. Its mission--to challenge the status quo by publishing provocative, thought-provoking, beyond-the-mainstream books, that engage readers across a range of genres. We believe that the time is ripe for new voices, fresh ideas, alternative stories, and an evolutionary change of direction--a change that sets free a sea of perspectives.

We're looking for new perspectives that facilitate health (mental, physical, heart) and happiness, that give a compelling take on the world around us and that offer an informed of life. We want to give the underdog with a paradigm-callenging manuscript (fiction, non-fiction), a moving book of poetry, the opportunity to engage the world. 
Your support will help Tayen Lane to save writers everywhere and change the world, one great book at a time.

TEAM: The Tayen Lane Publishing team is comprised of a core group who, interestingly, have all loved reading, writing, and discovering new books, since we were little, itty-bitty children. It is a love that has never let us go and never let us down. 



Kermit Heartsong (Publisher) writer, author, inventor and entrepreneur, has developed several award-winning word games (Articulation, Word By Word), written three non-fiction books, and has published 33 fiction, nonfiction and poetry books. He's also co-developed and patented a vector-based, neurally-networked software engine for DNA mapping and agricultural, biomedical and astronomical data management (which, of course, has absolutely nothing to do with publishing). 




Bri Bruce (Editor) is an editor and graphic designer from Santa Cruz, California. She holds a bachelor’s degree in literature and creative writing from UC Santa Cruz. Her work has appeared in over twenty anthologies, magazines, and literary publications, including The Sun Magazine, Northwind Magazine, Soundings Review, and the Monterey Poetry Review. She was nominated for the Ina Coolbrith Memorial Poetry Prize in 2009 as a student of Santa Cruz’s first poet laureate, Gary Young, and in 2014 she was the recipient of the PushPen Press Pendant Prize for Poetry. She is the award-winning author of The Weight of Snow.




Natylie Baldwin (Associate Editor). Natylie’s fiction and nonfiction have appeared in various publications including Sun Monthly, Dissident Voice, Energy Bulletin, NewtopiaMagazine, The Common Line, New York Journal of Books and The Lakeshore. Natylie is the co-author of Ukraine: ZBig’s Grand Chessboard & How the West Was Checkmated. She is currently working on two novels to be published in late 2015 and early 2016. She is a graduate of Cal State East Bay and also enjoys walking, hiking, the beach, movies, and classic television dramas. Natylie lives in the San Francisco Bay Area.


Hollen Reischer (Associate Editor) has written, edited, and proofread over 6,000 pages of creative nonfiction, poetry, fiction, and K–12 curriculum. She is also a grant writer for mission-based organizations. She is an editor of SOILED, a creative architecture periodical, and the former editor of the community-based Journal of Ordinary Thought. Hollen has contributed to publications at the Neighborhood Writing Alliance, Interfaith Worker Justice, Umoja Student Development Corporation, and Orion’s Mind. She is a graduate of Duke University and has received honors for her commitment to dialogue, social justice, and leadership. Hollen lives in Oakland, California, where she enjoys the Bay Area’s food, flora, fauna, and creative bustle.


Emma Thurgood (Associate Acquisitions Editor) is not Desperately Seeking Susan (a film she watched with rapt fascination from her cradle), she’s desperately seeking talented writers and provocative manuscripts across the various genres supported by Tayen Lane Publishing. A graduate of the University of Cambridge, Emma joined Tayen Lane in 2014, after a stint with Shepheard-Walwyn, an independent publisher based in London. Emma is a voracious reader, a dabbler in martial arts (she holds black belts in judo and aikido), a failed fashion designer and a superhero when it comes to whipping up culinary delights



   WITH YOUR HELP... We'll be able to fund the development and publication of thirty (30) new books! Now how many people can say that they've helped to fund the publication of thirty  (30) unique books?!
The funding will be utilized to:

Cost effectively design each of the thirty new books
To publish and distribute each new book 
To market each book via INGRAM's semi-annual, worldwide book catalog (it goes to over 30,000 retailers!) and also via its internal distribution engine
To guerrilla market via social media and other appropriate venues
To hire part-time help (read: young graduates who want a cool job) to maintain our various social media campaigns and blogs



THE PERKS...You're reviewing this campaign, quite possibly, because you're a lover of books. It only seems logical then, that your perks should be beautifully written, award-winning books, from writers--young and old--newly discovered.
However, should you be a ""lover squared"" of books and if you are able to contribute at the highest level, then you will:

Soon become an author with a well (ghost) written book (given that it complies with Tayen Lane Publishing's mandate-no hate)

Have a publishing contract with Tayen Lane

Travel free to San Francisco for a two-day working vacation. You'll need to meet with Tayen Lane's staff and your ghostwriter.


   THE BENEFITS Jessica Tyner, Pulitzer Prize, Griffin Trust, and Pushcart Prize nominated poet, published her first book with Tayen Lane. How her incredible talent went unnoticed and unappreciated was beyond us. The first stanza of her first poem to us, was alive and powerful, transportive and troubling. We were hooked immediately.
There are other poets and writers like Jessica, such as Andrea Rivas, Tristan Shaw, and Naomi Johnson, who are now writing for Tayen Lane. Please help us bring thirty (30) new beautiful, thought-provoking, and timely voices to the world.

POETRY
Jessica's poem, ""Passing,"" was nominated for a Pushchart Prize. The poem is also part of her Pulitzer and Griffin Prize nominated book, The Last Exotic Petting Zoo.






Passing

Jessica Tyner

Wouldn't it be wonderful to help discover the next Walt Whitman, Mark Twain (Samuel Clemens), Agatha  Christie, or Dante, Rowling, Orwell, Kafka? We believe this would be a big an incredible win-win for book lovers across the world. Don't you?
Here's a poem from a poet published in our Poems from Conflicted Hearts poetry anthology. She, Maurine Killough, is also immensely talented.

FANTASY & SCIENCE FICTION
If you love fantasy and science fiction with an interesting twist, you'll definitely want to consider several of our new books from the 30-30 campaign. VURK KOLL is but one of those books, told from the  perspective of a rather interesting and unusual clan of Orcs, who may usher in the demise of humanity.

NONFICTION
Love nonfiction books that actually give you a realistic picture of the world in which you live and what is truly going on based upon actual facts? We have a suite of books that do just that. 



AMERICA IS NOT BROKE: The unsustainability of the American economy is as familiar as the newscycle.  There is no money for social programs, no money to run the government, no money to cut taxes, and above all, we have to cut, cut, cut.

MI a t#k#m az a Humán Platform?
2012-ben alakult civil szervezet (jaj!) amely a humán területek (jajjaj!) civil szervezetei (wtf?!!) közötti együttműködéseket igyekszik elősegíteni (lol!!)
OK, elmagyarázzuk.

Civil szervezet vagyunk, amely valóban pályázott és nyert is pénzt a Norvég Civil Támogatási Alaptól (HAH!!!). Igen, mi szerveztünk tüntetést - többek között - Lázár János ellen (HAH-HAH!!) amikor ő betámadta az egykori origo szerkesztőségét, ezzel támadva a magyar sajtó szabadságát. Igen, emiatt sokan külföldi ügynöknek tartanak bennünket, és igen, még az összeesküvés-elméletekre kevésbé fogékony polgártársakban is van egyfajta félsz velünk kapcsolatban. De egyrészről azt gondoljuk, hogy ez rendben van - nyugodtan legyünk szkeptikusak és kritikusak egymással szemben, ez csak építi az amúgy súlyosan rohadó közállapotainkat - másrészt pedig nézzetek körbe a honlapunkon, mert ennél sokkal több dologgal foglalkozunk! Az elmúlt egy évben szerveztünk fórumot a Múzeum Negyed tervezett megépítése kapcsán ugyanúgy, ahogy tanszereket vettünk a hiánnyal küzdő iskoláknak, bemutatva a központosítás működésképtelenségét. Szerveztünk oknyomozó workshopot, adatbázist építettünk a 2010-2014 közötti kormányzati döntésekről, kritikáját adtuk a Magyar Művészeti Akadémia működésének, és csináltunk még ezeken kívül is sok más mindent. 

OK, és MI a baj az oroszokkal, hát a gáz is onnan jön! Azzal mi nincs rendben, hogy nem akarunk télen megfagyni?! Haló! És az rendben lenne, hogy az a nép, amely '89-'90-ben nemet mondott az egypártrendszerre, a KGST-re, Gorbacsov és Jelcin állameszményére, az most Orbán szűklátókörűsége és harácsolhatnékja miatt az orosz népet (és az ukránt, a tatárt, a csecsent, stb.) elnyomó, az emberi jogokat szemberöhögő volt titkosügynök karjaiba akarja visszavezetni a hazánkat? 
Szerintem a ruszkik nem hülyék. Ha nem bírnák a pasast, akkor elkergetnék a választáson, vagy tüntetnének ellene. 
Hát, sajnos az a baj, hogy megpróbálták mindkettőt, sőt még annál is többet, de nem jártak sikerrel. Putyin uralkodása alatt több mint 100 újságírót öltek meg vagy zártak rács mögé. Bizonyított tény, hogy Putyin 2011-ben brutálisan elcsalta a parlamenti választásokat.  Oroszországban törvényben tiltják a káromkodást a színházi előadásokban, filmekben és tévé adásokban. Ugyanígy tiltva van a ""homoszexuális propaganda"" ami tovább fokozta a leszbikus, meleg, biszexuális és transznemű emberekkel szembeni gyűlöletet, és számos, velük szemben elkövetett brutális bűncselekményt ""eredményezett"". Oroszországban a legnagyobb a jövedelmi egyenlőtlenség: kisszámú, de bitang gazdag oligarcha kezében összpontosulnak hatalmas vagyonok, miközben milliók nyomorognak. Míg Moszkva a világ legdrágább fővárosa, addig az orosz és az amerikai átlagkereset között ötszörös (!) a különbség. Ja, és a tüntetések! Ha valaki ""folytatólagosan"" szervez tüntetést, nyilvános találkozót fél éven belül, akkor akár 1 millió rubelre is büntethetik. Akar a halál magának ilyen politikai szövetségest, épp elég nekünk a hazai eresztés! 
OK, ez tényleg elég tré szitu! De mit tudnak tenni mókusörsék a világ egyik szuperhatalmának vezetőjével szemben???? LOL :-))))))))) 

Hát mi magunkban szinte semmit. És nem, ez nem a klasszikus lehúzós duma, hogy támogass, és többen leszünk. Nem. Olyan kampányt akarunk készíteni, amelyhez sokan csatlakozhatnak, és mindenki, aki szeretné, kifejezheti a maga egyéni módján a nemtetszését Putyinnal szemben. Mert szerintünk ez klassz dolog.

Azért kérjük, hogy támogass minket, hogy

1) közösen belekiáltsuk az önkényuraink fülébe - Putyin: NYET!

A Keleti Pályaudvartól a Nyugati Pályaudvarig vonulunk február 16-án 18.00-tól. A vonulás során kis teherautóval szeretnénk kísérni és motiválni a tömeget hangszórókkal, illetve nagy színpaddal várni mindenkit. 
2) szobrot állíthassunk Putyinnak!
Igen, folytatva a régi, szép állam-kapitalista hagyományokat, a testvér-ország diktátorának szobrot kívánunk állítani a belvárosban (jégből, yeah:-), hogy méltóképpen éltessük megjelenését a városban!
3) fórumokat szervezhessünk, és neten streamelhessük őket!

    Nem is rossz. De azért ez g@ci sok pénz amit kértek. Mi a garancia, hogy nem pattantok meg?

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><div> <h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>A little over a year ago, I was able to return to Rwanda, Africa where I spent some extended time with the Ba'Twa people just outside Kigali. I was captivated by their original stories and upon research, found that their stories were not preserved anywhere. I told them I would like to capture their stories, put them in print, give them back to them, and release them to the world. I told them a portion of the profits of these books would come back to the tellers of these wonderful stories. One older lady was almost in tears upon hearing that they could make money from these precious stories. She then got very serious and asked what would happen when she died.....I told her I would make sure that her children and her children's children would get the money for the stories she told me. I thought she was going to hug me right then and there. I later learned that this tribe used to rely on their pot making skills to provide food for their village. Their ancestors had told them that this skill would keep them fed. As time has gone on, their pots have not sold and starvation was a real threat. They felt like their ancestors had lied to them. This project can provide much needed income to these people and a sense of importance as the keeper of the stories of Rwanda.</p>
<p>I'm Flavia Everman and I have been to Rwanda a total of 5 times, each one getting more exciting as I discover more opportunities to help people worldwide. I have collected a total of 10 stories, have gotten them twice translated for accuracy and even have the paintings and music score for one of the stories. I'm stuck at the publishing and copyright stage and THIS is where you come in. I have to have money up front to get these stories ready for the publishers, get them published and make sure they are correctly copyrighted so that the Ba'Twa are the OWNERS of these stories, which means an international copyright is needed. This concept is very important to me as these stories belong to them and I want to make sure THEY receive full acknowledgement for them. I am returning to Rwanda in a few months to collect more stories so your donation will also be used for transportation, translators, guides, artists, art supplies and publishing. I really appreciate your help and may God bless you.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3> <p>With $2,000, I'll be able to pay for a part of my transportation (I've been saving on my own and have most of the plane ticket) which will include motorcycle taxis, bicycle taxis and buses. I'm not afraid to use public transportation. I'll be staying with friends when I'm there, so my housing will be minimal. That way, I can use the funding for what I really need to use it for: Publishing, Copyright, Artist, Art Supplies, Translators, paper supplies and everything else that publishing books will cost. If I don't get full funding, I will use what I get along with local donations to go as far as I can. As said earlier, I have 10 stories already in my possession, but I need the money to get them out to the world. As I receive funding, they WILL BE INTERNATIONALLY COPYRIGHTED AND PUBLISHED! If I receive MORE than I am requesting, then that money will be used to collect MORE stories, get them translated, hire Rwandan artists and get MORE stories out to the world. Oh, this is exciting!</p>
<p>For ALL of those who donate at any level, you will get a running blog of my journey, complete with photos along the way. The internet is spotty over there, so it might not be every day, but I dare say  it will be an interesting read when you get them. I've done this in the past for my travels. For donations of $100 or more, I'll make sure you get at least one completed Ba'Twa original story, complete with Rwandan art done by a Rwandan genocide survivor, who also will be paid for his/her services for each book. This is an unique situation also. Rwandan jobs are largely given to relatives. As the orphans left after the 1994 genocide have no family, jobs are hard to get, no matter how qualified. This opportunity to paint for these books is a huge blessing for them. </p>
<p>Thank you once again for considering giving to this campaign. This money will go a long way in Rwanda and will be appreciated by so many people. I'm hoping to make bookmarks of some of the Rwandan artwork for the books, so if you want one, let me know!</p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The stories I collect will be one-of-a-kind because the Ba'Twa have been passing these stories down through word of mouth throughout their generations. These stories are original folklore of the people of Rwanda. Many more citizens of Rwanda are becoming educated and are essentially throwing their old ways out the window, including their stories. I was talking to a Canadian couple the last time I visited and mentioned that I was afraid some of these stories might be lost in just a generation or two. They said it might be sooner than that. With this project I want to stress to the Rwandans just how important their literature is to them and the world. It reflects their culture, their history, them. </p>
<p>The Ba'Twa are the poorest members of the country and I'd like to reward them for carrying the stories of their countrymen throughout the ages. This means that I will be giving them a JOB! For every book that I collect, I will include on the cover the name of the Ba'Twa who told me the story and include a little history of the story. That person, every time that book sells, will get 33% of the proceeds. I'm also employing genocide orphans as artists for these stories. In Rwanda, most jobs are given to relatives by a manger or owner of a company. The orphans generally have no relatives left and therefore have an extremely hard time finding employment. This project will also help them, as the illustrator for each book will also receive 33% of the proceeds of that book. </p>
<p>With your help, we can preserve something that may one day become extinct without this project, we can help the poor by teaching them the value of their words, stories and artwork. I'm really looking forward to learning more about these people and sharing this story with you and the rest of the world. I hope you can join me. </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I have just found out that my favorite translator is doing a volunteer work in Germany and won't be in Rwanda while I am there. God gave him to me by an accidental meeting at the Rwandan Library and so I am confident that God will supply another equally talented translator this year.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary A little over a year ago, I was able to return to Rwanda, Africa where I spent some extended time with the Ba'Twa people just outside Kigali. I was captivated by their original stories and upon research, found that their stories were not preserved anywhere. I told them I would like to capture their stories, put them in print, give them back to them, and release them to the world. I told them a portion of the profits of these books would come back to the tellers of these wonderful stories. One older lady was almost in tears upon hearing that they could make money from these precious stories. She then got very serious and asked what would happen when she died.....I told her I would make sure that her children and her children's children would get the money for the stories she told me. I thought she was going to hug me right then and there. I later learned that this tribe used to rely on their pot making skills to provide food for their village. Their ancestors had told them that this skill would keep them fed. As time has gone on, their pots have not sold and starvation was a real threat. They felt like their ancestors had lied to them. This project can provide much needed income to these people and a sense of importance as the keeper of the stories of Rwanda.
I'm Flavia Everman and I have been to Rwanda a total of 5 times, each one getting more exciting as I discover more opportunities to help people worldwide. I have collected a total of 10 stories, have gotten them twice translated for accuracy and even have the paintings and music score for one of the stories. I'm stuck at the publishing and copyright stage and THIS is where you come in. I have to have money up front to get these stories ready for the publishers, get them published and make sure they are correctly copyrighted so that the Ba'Twa are the OWNERS of these stories, which means an international copyright is needed. This concept is very important to me as these stories belong to them and I want to make sure THEY receive full acknowledgement for them. I am returning to Rwanda in a few months to collect more stories so your donation will also be used for transportation, translators, guides, artists, art supplies and publishing. I really appreciate your help and may God bless you.   What I Need & What You'll Get With $2,000, I'll be able to pay for a part of my transportation (I've been saving on my own and have most of the plane ticket) which will include motorcycle taxis, bicycle taxis and buses. I'm not afraid to use public transportation. I'll be staying with friends when I'm there, so my housing will be minimal. That way, I can use the funding for what I really need to use it for: Publishing, Copyright, Artist, Art Supplies, Translators, paper supplies and everything else that publishing books will cost. If I don't get full funding, I will use what I get along with local donations to go as far as I can. As said earlier, I have 10 stories already in my possession, but I need the money to get them out to the world. As I receive funding, they WILL BE INTERNATIONALLY COPYRIGHTED AND PUBLISHED! If I receive MORE than I am requesting, then that money will be used to collect MORE stories, get them translated, hire Rwandan artists and get MORE stories out to the world. Oh, this is exciting!
For ALL of those who donate at any level, you will get a running blog of my journey, complete with photos along the way. The internet is spotty over there, so it might not be every day, but I dare say  it will be an interesting read when you get them. I've done this in the past for my travels. For donations of $100 or more, I'll make sure you get at least one completed Ba'Twa original story, complete with Rwandan art done by a Rwandan genocide survivor, who also will be paid for his/her services for each book. This is an unique situation also. Rwandan jobs are largely given to relatives. As the orphans left after the 1994 genocide have no family, jobs are hard to get, no matter how qualified. This opportunity to paint for these books is a huge blessing for them. 
Thank you once again for considering giving to this campaign. This money will go a long way in Rwanda and will be appreciated by so many people. I'm hoping to make bookmarks of some of the Rwandan artwork for the books, so if you want one, let me know!
  The Impact The stories I collect will be one-of-a-kind because the Ba'Twa have been passing these stories down through word of mouth throughout their generations. These stories are original folklore of the people of Rwanda. Many more citizens of Rwanda are becoming educated and are essentially throwing their old ways out the window, including their stories. I was talking to a Canadian couple the last time I visited and mentioned that I was afraid some of these stories might be lost in just a generation or two. They said it might be sooner than that. With this project I want to stress to the Rwandans just how important their literature is to them and the world. It reflects their culture, their history, them. 
The Ba'Twa are the poorest members of the country and I'd like to reward them for carrying the stories of their countrymen throughout the ages. This means that I will be giving them a JOB! For every book that I collect, I will include on the cover the name of the Ba'Twa who told me the story and include a little history of the story. That person, every time that book sells, will get 33% of the proceeds. I'm also employing genocide orphans as artists for these stories. In Rwanda, most jobs are given to relatives by a manger or owner of a company. The orphans generally have no relatives left and therefore have an extremely hard time finding employment. This project will also help them, as the illustrator for each book will also receive 33% of the proceeds of that book. 
With your help, we can preserve something that may one day become extinct without this project, we can help the poor by teaching them the value of their words, stories and artwork. I'm really looking forward to learning more about these people and sharing this story with you and the rest of the world. I hope you can join me. 
  Risks & Challenges I have just found out that my favorite translator is doing a volunteer work in Germany and won't be in Rwanda while I am there. God gave him to me by an accidental meeting at the Rwandan Library and so I am confident that God will supply another equally talented translator this year.
On my last trip, I began learning Kinyarwandan (the language) and became quite proficient on the public transportation. I still have things to learn and this year will be no exception. I live humbly and simply, like the people there.

Michael Jackson. <b><i>Phoenix Rising: Life’s New Beginning</i></b>, an eloquently written powerful
and inspiring guide to helping people find the key to their life anew and <b>Phoenix’s</b>
brilliant masterpiece </p>

extraordinary abilities have taken him all over the globe.<span>  His career even expanded into the lucrative
world of modeling, as he has modeled high fashion clothing for top designers
such as Gianni Versace, Hermes, and Jean Paul Gaultier.</span></p>
<p>Using his expertise, <b>Phoenix</b>
has gone behind the scenes, working with major corporations, record labels, and
film companies worldwide.<span>  Managing and
operating his own public relations firm, <b>Phoenix</b>

<p><b>The Dancing Machine Review </b>show, the first and only
Tribute to the Jackson Five, is the brainchild of its founder and producer, <b>Phoenix</b>. <b>The Dancing Machine Review </b>is a breathtaking show that features a nostalgic
medley of <b>The Jackson Five</b> and <b>The</b> <b>Jacksons</b> number #1 classic hits from the 70’s and 80’s including <i>I Want You Back, ABC, The Love You Save,
I’ll Be There, Dancing Machine, Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)</i>, along
with the King of Pop, <b>Michael Jackson’s</b>
multi-million selling hit,<i> Don’t Stop
‘til you Get Enough, Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’, </i>and many more. It is a truly awesome retrospect that renders
a standing ovation each and every time!<span>  <b>The
Dancing Machine Review </b></span>is a must-see show for all audiences around the
world that captures the nostalgia of <b>The
Jackson Five</b> and the magic of <b>The
Jacksons</b>.<span>  </span></p>
<p><b>Phoenix</b> is a man of many
talents including music biography author, performer, show producer, and music
and entertainment historian. His expertise in the field of music and
entertainment spans over a century, from the black and white motion picture
films from the silent and talkie eras, to the birth of Jazz, Blues, then Rock
and Roll, to the more modern forms of music today. Most specifically, <b>Phoenix’s</b> expertise lies in the last
four decades of music and entertainment, to which he has lived and witnessed
firsthand.</p>
<p><b>Phoenix</b> can quote with the
utmost accuracy, times, dates and events of the last forty years of
entertainment history without any reference other than his own internal
cerebral encyclopedia of facts. Without question, he clearly surpasses most
other music historians of this generation with his knowledge of entertainment
history and its effect on the culture and people from that moment in time.</p>
<p><b>Phoenix</b> is one of the most
informed music historians of our time who will provide powerful insight,
detail, and fact, and how it all ties in together with the artist of whom he is
speaking, for a truly unforgettable experience. </p>
<p><b>Phoenix</b> also ventured into
another media realm with his own <b>Phoenix
Rising Radio Show</b> featuring <b>Phoenix</b>
discussing hot topics on relationships, success, life skills and so much more.</p>
<p><b>Currently,
Phoenix’s mission is to spread consciousness and awareness to people of all
ages and nationalities worldwide by enlightening and educating the populace
with his superb speeches of encouragement and inspiration. </b></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1275147/files/20150306205443-new-postcard__1.jpg?1425704083"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p><p></p>

For those who may want to know more about me, PHOENIX, the author, here’s a brief summary
of my career below:

BIOGRAPHY
Phoenix the dynamic author,
philosopher, motivational speaker, intellectual and logician, has helped
countless people find the key to their life and a new beginning. Phoenix has funded several charitable
organizations and programs for children. Phoenix has made
numerous contributions and volunteered his time and efforts for many worthy
causes such as the Board of Education, American Cancer Society, Make A Wish
Foundation, United Negro College Fund, and AIDS Foundation. Organizing and
sponsoring a celebrity softball game, Phoenix
brought together recording artists such as The Jacksons, and professional
athletes from the NFL and NBL to help raise money for abused and homeless
children.  Phoenix
donated his time to helping the Youth on the Rise Foundation, founded by former
Oakland Raiders player, A.C. Caswell, helping to bring programs for the Valley
of the Sun’s underprivileged youth.  In
his never-ending quest to bring happiness and joy to children, Phoenix brought celebrity
performers to St. Joseph’s Hospital Children’s Ward to brighten the lives and
spirits of the children in the hospital during the holiday season.  
Phoenix also participated in and
helped develop the Dreams Do Come True Foundation annual events for higher
learning by coming together and joining forces with Governor of Arizona, Jane
D. Hull; the Mayor of Phoenix, Arizona, Skip Rimsza; and the Mayor of Los
Angeles, California, Richard J. Riordan. The Dreams Do Come True Foundation and
its programs were designed to help children learn to say no to drugs, get an
education, and follow their dreams. Phoenix
was honored with special Proclamation Awards from the Mayor of Los Angeles,
California, Richard J. Riordan and the Mayor of Phoenix, Arizona, Skip Rimsza. 
Phoenix, born Arthur Phoenix and raised in Brooklyn, New York, was also commended for
his dedication to his hometown community of Brooklyn, New York, by the Mayor of
New York City, Michael R. Bloomberg, and Brooklyn Borough President, Marty
Markowitz, who have bestowed upon him Proclamation Awards for his success and
outstanding work and dedication to the community.
Phoenix, a former spokesperson for the Jackson family has
also managed one of the famous Jackson brothers, Tito Jackson. Seeing the potential and diversity in Tito
Jackson as a performer, Phoenix is
responsible for helping to pioneer Tito’s solo career and launch him as a Blues
artist. Phoenix has been interviewed
by the media in news outlets around the world regarding his professional
commentary and expertise on Michael Jackson and the Jackson family.  
Phoenix, the acclaimed author, has also written three
compelling books:
Touched by the Jacksons, a riveting music autobiography that intertwines Phoenix’s life story with a unique, in-depth chronicle of the
Jacksons’ careers Michael
Jackson: The Lie Becomes the Truth,
a vivid, first-time-ever told, insightful perspective on the life of the late
Michael Jackson. Phoenix Rising: Life’s New Beginning, an eloquently written powerful
and inspiring guide to helping people find the key to their life anew and Phoenix’s
brilliant masterpiece 
Phoenix’s talents and his
extraordinary abilities have taken him all over the globe.  His career even expanded into the lucrative
world of modeling, as he has modeled high fashion clothing for top designers
such as Gianni Versace, Hermes, and Jean Paul Gaultier.
Using his expertise, Phoenix
has gone behind the scenes, working with major corporations, record labels, and
film companies worldwide.  Managing and
operating his own public relations firm, Phoenix
has worked with such prestigious clients as former heavyweight boxing champion,
Mike Tyson, BET’s 20th Anniversary, SoSoDef Sports Management, the
1998 Billboard Music Awards, Smokey Robinson, and many others.  He is highly acclaimed as an author, a music
historian, and an expert in the field of entertainment.
 
The Dancing Machine Review show, the first and only
Tribute to the Jackson Five, is the brainchild of its founder and producer, Phoenix. The Dancing Machine Review is a breathtaking show that features a nostalgic
medley of The Jackson Five and The Jacksons number #1 classic hits from the 70’s and 80’s including I Want You Back, ABC, The Love You Save,
I’ll Be There, Dancing Machine, Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground), along
with the King of Pop, Michael Jackson’s
multi-million selling hit, Don’t Stop
‘til you Get Enough, Wanna Be Startin’ Somethin’, and many more. It is a truly awesome retrospect that renders
a standing ovation each and every time!  The
Dancing Machine Review is a must-see show for all audiences around the
world that captures the nostalgia of The
Jackson Five and the magic of The
Jacksons.  
Phoenix is a man of many
talents including music biography author, performer, show producer, and music
and entertainment historian. His expertise in the field of music and
entertainment spans over a century, from the black and white motion picture
films from the silent and talkie eras, to the birth of Jazz, Blues, then Rock
and Roll, to the more modern forms of music today. Most specifically, Phoenix’s expertise lies in the last
four decades of music and entertainment, to which he has lived and witnessed
firsthand.
Phoenix can quote with the
utmost accuracy, times, dates and events of the last forty years of
entertainment history without any reference other than his own internal
cerebral encyclopedia of facts. Without question, he clearly surpasses most
other music historians of this generation with his knowledge of entertainment
history and its effect on the culture and people from that moment in time.
Phoenix is one of the most
informed music historians of our time who will provide powerful insight,
detail, and fact, and how it all ties in together with the artist of whom he is
speaking, for a truly unforgettable experience. 
Phoenix also ventured into
another media realm with his own Phoenix
Rising Radio Show featuring Phoenix
discussing hot topics on relationships, success, life skills and so much more.
Currently,
Phoenix’s mission is to spread consciousness and awareness to people of all
ages and nationalities worldwide by enlightening and educating the populace
with his superb speeches of encouragement and inspiration. 

“I want to continue to be the voice that
leads many for so very few that can’t speak and the echo
that carries the words of the great leaders that have left their legacy for
mankind.”

<div>             My name is Brian Zolenski.  I do freelance computer work as well as assistant work for various clients.  I've lived all over the world, but call Boston my home, and I reside in Los Angeles, California. I've always been fascinated with the human emotions and the extreme states of it, being from artifacts, other people, or just memories that trigger it.  Recently I've been put through one of the most extreme cases of it, and started documenting the most powerful photos and descriptions to my personal journal.  Doing this gave me the idea of how my journal was so unique, but how would it look compared to other people's memories and triggers?</div>

</p>
<p>Millee &amp; Me is a true story about a haunted doll. A couple of years ago while spending the weekend with a friend
investigating paranormal activity in the California Gold Country, I acquired an
old vintage Raggedy Ann doll at an
antique store.  The doll is about 50
years old and very well loved.  After acquiring the doll, almost from the
“get-go” weird  “things” started to
happen; doors slammed, lights turned on and off and on several occasions a female child’s  voice was heard in the house, when no other
females were present.  </p>
<p>After a few weeks of some strange happenings, and me
beginning to feel like I was losing my mind, I contacted my friend Jessica and we got out our
investigation equipment and lo’ and behold…. We got a response! From the doll!</p>

We're travelling (mostly) overland from Tbilisi, Georgia to Beiging, China and then all the way to St, Petersburg, Russia by rail. Here’s a very detailed itinerary and map that shows the whole route.

We’ll be immersing ourselves in the cultural and culinary wealth of the places we’ll visit and condensing it all into a cookbook and phrasebook. 
You can learn more about us and follow the trip on our blog and feel free to click around the map to see when we’ll be where and how. If you have any questions, check out our exhaustive and exhausting FAQ and we’d appreciate any feedback, comments and general good will you have to spare. Thanks for your support! – Mike and Kai.

<h3>What is 'Lots of Watts'?</h3>
<p>My name is Sam Loch and I have 20 unbroken years of indoor rowing experience.  I've learned my craft the hard way with plenty of trial and error, but am now the holder of 3 open world records (1 minute, 1000m and 24hr tandem).  I am also a Princeton University graduate, a two-time Olympian (2008, 2012) and my best 2km is 5:49.4.</p>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to take the information gleaned from my research and experimentation and cram it into your brain.  Without this project the guidance I intend to provide will extend to a those I coach, but may not become available to the public.  You may never find the most effective means of achieving your maximum capacity on the indoor rower.   </p>
<p>In exchange for your support I will not only produce the aforementioned guide, but pursue the 500m World Record in the necessary manner. I will test myself and my methods under the most acute of circumstances.  </p>
<p><font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I </span>appreciate<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> all of the support I have </span>received<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> thus far</span>, but this is my Mt Everest and you can help me reach the summit whilst I help you reach yours.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span></font></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The creation of an indoor rowing guide has been on my to-do list for years now, but much like mustering a performance on the rower, I do better when there's a strong sense of obligation - with a commitment to the process.  Without the pressure of an expectant audience I fear this project never comes to fruition.  </p>
<p>I've set the funding target at $20,000.  This is the figure that will allow me the resources to assemble the book and train for the World Record simultaneously. As a return on your investment the following perks will be available . . .</p>
<ul>
<li>Lots of Watts - A innovative guide to indoor rowing (ebook)</li>
<li>Apparel from The Watt Farm</li>
<li>The Watt Farm banners</li>
<li>Random international rowing apparel</li>
<li>A Skype consultation to personally discuss your performance goals and how to get there</li>
<li>A Skype consultation with a customised training program</li>
<li>A in-person coaching session</li>

<li>Specific strength training</li>
<li>Mobility, injury prevention and management</li>
<li>Race day planning and execution</li>
<li>A World Record training log</li>

<li>Personal insights on the training process</li>
</ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If my target is reached I will most definitely assemble the guide, but that does not guarantee I will be successful in my World Record attempt.  In my opinion it is the gnarliest record in all of indoor rowing and it will take every ounce of my capacity to better that performance.  I will not know if my best is good enough unless I try.  I may fail, but will do everything in my power to succeed. </p>
<p>You will receive perks for your support, but you will also see a man put his balls on the line whilst striving to reach the upper limits of his ability.  </p>

<p>Sixteen Stories will explore how culture is preserved — or diluted — after immigration, and how one person's life can affect the next generation.</p>
<h2>Sixteen Stories</h2>
<p>I never would have dreamed that I would stand in my great-grandfather's ancestral home in southern China, or that I would unearth documents from the 1800's listing all the siblings of another great-grandfather we hardly knew anything about. </p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>These astonishing and surprisingly emotional experiences moved me to further research and start writing a book, called Sixteen Stories, featuring my eight great-grandparents, four grandparents, parents, my brother, and myself. Each story is written in the first person through the eyes of a different person, taking the reader to a specific year between 1895 and 2015, and to a different place: China, Poland, Russia, Latvia, California, Nevada, London.</span></p>
<p>Every person's chapter is rich with the details of the specific cultural and historic context. You will discover how one story shapes the next: how one person's own history and character affect others, sometimes as an inspiration, and sometimes provoking tragedy. </p>
<p>While this is a deeply personal project, my aim is for it to be a touching and intriguing work which speaks to all readers through its universal human truths.</p>
<p>I am launching this Indiegogo campaign because carving out time for this endeavour in the mornings and weekends just isn't enough. Having the funds to cover research, writing and editing time, and the book production itself, will mean that the project can keep moving ahead with its current momentum.</p>
<p>I’ll be doing all of the marketing and social media myself, using my expertise as a branding and marketing professional.</p>
<p><strong>The planned publishing date is October 2018. Three chapters are already finished.</strong></p>

<h3>Prévente automnale 2017</h3>
<p>La Revue Souffle d'Éden, spécialisée dans la publication de récits de science-fiction, fantasy, fantastique pour la jeunesse, lance sa prévente automnale. La revue est soutenue par des auteurs et illustrateurs de talent, passionnés par leur art, mais aussi par des jeunes désireux de vivre une première expérience éditoriale. Le projet Souffle d'Éden compte <strong>sur l'implication bénévole</strong> de tous les participants, incluant les fondateurs, et nous espérons devenir une revue professionnelle dans les années à venir. Nous sollicitons aujourd'hui votre appui financier pour réaliser ses publications de l'automne 2017.</p>
<ul>
<li>Numéro 5.1 ""Même pas peur!""</li>
<li>Numéro 6 ""Numéro Seuss"" (hommage à Theodore Giesel)</li>
</ul>
<p>Les revues de la prévente automnale seront livrées en octobre 2017 (pour le numéro 5.1) et de décembre 2017 (pour le numéro 6).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>À quoi serviront les montants demandés</h3>
<p>Les montants reçus serviront à <strong>produire, diffuser et distribuer</strong> les numéros de la revue. Plus vous êtes généreux, plus nous pourrons <strong>proposer différentes activités de lancement </strong>tout au long de l'année, dans la province de Québec, où vous seriez invités (donateurs des plans Zonda et Microrafale).</p>
<p>Aussi, en devenant<strong> membre votant à vie</strong> de la coopérative pour la modique somme de 3$, vous <strong>assurez sa survie </strong>et son lectorat. Les gens désireux de rejoindre la coopérative à titre de membre votant, ont ainsi la possibilité de recevoir des ristournes sur les profits générés à la fin de l'année, et même de proposer de nouvelles idées lors des assemblées virtuelles. Que vous ayez 13 ou 101 ans, votre quote-part de 3$ vous assure d'être écouté.</p>
<p>Plus nous aurons de précommandes et d'abonnements annuels, meilleurs seront les prix proposés par les imprimeurs. La marge de profit permettra ainsi de payer nos artistes et de donner de meilleures ristournes annuelles aux membres votants.</p>
<h3>Votre impact</h3>
<p>N'étant pas encore distribuée en librairies, la revue Souffle d'Éden n'est imprimée que pour les particuliers directement. Lorsque vous commandez votre exemplaire du fanzine, vous participez à sa conception et sa distribution directe.</p>
<p>Aussi, lorsque vous devenez membre de la coopérative, vous faites entendre votre voix et permettez une rémunération par ristournes annuelles aux créateurs.</p>
<p>Si vous devenez partenaire ou commanditaire de la revue, votre aide assure non seulement la continuité du projet, mais une plus large diffusion dans la francophonie ainsi que différentes activités de lancement et de promotion tout au long de l'année.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>L'origine du projet</h3>
<p>Le projet Souffle d'Éden est né de deux passions : la littérature de genres pour la jeunesse, chez Martyne Pigeon, et les arts visuels, chez Jean-Philippe Paré. Le but premier était d'offrir une vitrine et une première expérience de publication dans une revue bénévole conçue pour les jeunes et réalisée en partie par des jeunes.</p>
<p>De par les valeurs judéo-chrétiennes partagées au sein du couple fondateur, il était donc naturel d'y retrouver des textes et illustrations desquelles émaneraient de bons vieux thèmes universels tels que la charité, le respect, l'amour et la foi. Tout ceci dans le but de rehausser l'estime de soi, le courage et la persévérance chez nous futurs jeunes artistes.</p>

</div></div>","Prévente automnale 2017
La Revue Souffle d'Éden, spécialisée dans la publication de récits de science-fiction, fantasy, fantastique pour la jeunesse, lance sa prévente automnale. La revue est soutenue par des auteurs et illustrateurs de talent, passionnés par leur art, mais aussi par des jeunes désireux de vivre une première expérience éditoriale. Le projet Souffle d'Éden compte sur l'implication bénévole de tous les participants, incluant les fondateurs, et nous espérons devenir une revue professionnelle dans les années à venir. Nous sollicitons aujourd'hui votre appui financier pour réaliser ses publications de l'automne 2017.

Numéro 5.1 ""Même pas peur!""
Numéro 6 ""Numéro Seuss"" (hommage à Theodore Giesel)

Les revues de la prévente automnale seront livrées en octobre 2017 (pour le numéro 5.1) et de décembre 2017 (pour le numéro 6).

À quoi serviront les montants demandés
Les montants reçus serviront à produire, diffuser et distribuer les numéros de la revue. Plus vous êtes généreux, plus nous pourrons proposer différentes activités de lancement tout au long de l'année, dans la province de Québec, où vous seriez invités (donateurs des plans Zonda et Microrafale).
Aussi, en devenant membre votant à vie de la coopérative pour la modique somme de 3$, vous assurez sa survie et son lectorat. Les gens désireux de rejoindre la coopérative à titre de membre votant, ont ainsi la possibilité de recevoir des ristournes sur les profits générés à la fin de l'année, et même de proposer de nouvelles idées lors des assemblées virtuelles. Que vous ayez 13 ou 101 ans, votre quote-part de 3$ vous assure d'être écouté.
Plus nous aurons de précommandes et d'abonnements annuels, meilleurs seront les prix proposés par les imprimeurs. La marge de profit permettra ainsi de payer nos artistes et de donner de meilleures ristournes annuelles aux membres votants.
Votre impact
N'étant pas encore distribuée en librairies, la revue Souffle d'Éden n'est imprimée que pour les particuliers directement. Lorsque vous commandez votre exemplaire du fanzine, vous participez à sa conception et sa distribution directe.
Aussi, lorsque vous devenez membre de la coopérative, vous faites entendre votre voix et permettez une rémunération par ristournes annuelles aux créateurs.
Si vous devenez partenaire ou commanditaire de la revue, votre aide assure non seulement la continuité du projet, mais une plus large diffusion dans la francophonie ainsi que différentes activités de lancement et de promotion tout au long de l'année.

L'origine du projet
Le projet Souffle d'Éden est né de deux passions : la littérature de genres pour la jeunesse, chez Martyne Pigeon, et les arts visuels, chez Jean-Philippe Paré. Le but premier était d'offrir une vitrine et une première expérience de publication dans une revue bénévole conçue pour les jeunes et réalisée en partie par des jeunes.
De par les valeurs judéo-chrétiennes partagées au sein du couple fondateur, il était donc naturel d'y retrouver des textes et illustrations desquelles émaneraient de bons vieux thèmes universels tels que la charité, le respect, l'amour et la foi. Tout ceci dans le but de rehausser l'estime de soi, le courage et la persévérance chez nous futurs jeunes artistes.

Pour en savoir plus
Pour en apprendre davantage sur la revue Souffle d'Éden et ses projets annuels, merci de visiter notre page Facebook Souffle d'Éden.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I hope you will enjoy The Mystery of the Lost Remote as much as Joyce, James and I have enjoyed creating it.

<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>The Team</strong></h3>
<p>I am Erin Kimmett.  A wife, daughter, mother, sister and granddaughter.  A graphic artist, jewelry designer and byzantine iconographer. To keep myself <i>extra </i>busy, I sing in my church choir, serve on the boards of various organizations and, as a self-proclaimed ""wannabe caterer,"" I embrace any opportunity to feed a crowd -- large or small, 'round my table or theirs!</p>
<p>Alexis El Massih is a food, wedding, and fine art portrait photographer based in Boston, MA.  She believes the art of food begins when planted and nurtured in the field, and is brought to deeper meaning when prepared with love and gratitude for the nourishment and gathering of friends, family, and community. </p>
<p>I first met Alexis when she visited my icon studio in hopes of learning the sacred art of iconography. We spoke about icons, but before the meeting was over, we had covered a myriad of subjects and found we share many of the same passions: most notably our passion for food and hospitality! I told Alexis about my cookbook and before we knew what happened, we were collaborating on Hospitality and Joy. It has become OUR baby as we work nights and weekends or grab a few minutes at lunch to collaborate and plan the next shoot! </p>
<h3><strong>The Cookbook</strong></h3>
<p>There is little that gives me more joy than preparing a meal and sharing it with others. I am a feeder, plain and simple. A hostess to my core! As my grandmother would say, I “come by it honestly.” She, too, was a feeder. The lessons learned growing up in her kitchen shaped my life and set me on a path of cooking, sharing, serving and loving. </p>
<p>On the morning she died in 2008 I sat down and began writing stories, never dreaming that years later I would bring that collection together with my own favorite recipes.  But here we are, I now have a book and I need your help to bring it to print. </p>
<p>My good friend and food photographer, Alexis El Massih, and I have brought to life some amazing recipes for your family in a cookbook titled <i>Hospitality and Joy</i>. It is a beautifully designed 8.5"" x 10"" smythe-sewn hardbound book printed on heavy weight satin finish paper.  Ninety-six colorful pages feature my go-to, tried and true hostess recipes each illustrated in photos that are as beautiful to look at as the food is delicious! </p>
<p>This book, nearly a decade in the making, honors my Sitey--my grandmother--""Aunt Vi"" as she was lovingly known to most, and celebrates an ethos of hospitality and joy that extends well beyond the kitchen.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>This project is very personal to me. As a first-time author, seasoned graphic designer, and trusted curator/creator of these recipes, I decided to self-publish so that every detail would be <i>exactly</i> as I envisioned.<strong> It will cost $12,500 to produce and print 500 hard-bound copies of the first edition of <i>Hospitality and Joy</i>. </strong> </p>
<p>Most of these expenses should be covered through book pre-orders here on Indiegogo. You can preorder a book for $28 plus shipping. <strong><i>Or even better,</i> give $40 and get an autographed first-edition copy of the book plus a bundle of recipes cards designed to coordinate with the book! </strong> If you'd like to help further, we have designed some <strong>amazing perks</strong> to reward you for your generosity, such as a uniquely designed <i>Hospitality and Joy</i> tea towel, a private lesson in food photography, or a dinner party for you and a group of friends.  <strong>Check out all the options, there's surely one just right for you!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your pre-order purchase is vital to the success of this project! </strong>I am committed to publishing this book whether or not the entire $12,500 is met, but your pre-ordered book purchase will take the financial pressure off me (thank you, in advance :-)  Should we exceed our goal, we will happily increase the volume of books ordered (and probably the number of pages in my book :-) so it will be a win all the way around! We are forever grateful for your support and confidence in us.</p>

I am Erin Kimmett.  A wife, daughter, mother, sister and granddaughter.  A graphic artist, jewelry designer and byzantine iconographer. To keep myself extra busy, I sing in my church choir, serve on the boards of various organizations and, as a self-proclaimed ""wannabe caterer,"" I embrace any opportunity to feed a crowd -- large or small, 'round my table or theirs!
Alexis El Massih is a food, wedding, and fine art portrait photographer based in Boston, MA.  She believes the art of food begins when planted and nurtured in the field, and is brought to deeper meaning when prepared with love and gratitude for the nourishment and gathering of friends, family, and community. 
I first met Alexis when she visited my icon studio in hopes of learning the sacred art of iconography. We spoke about icons, but before the meeting was over, we had covered a myriad of subjects and found we share many of the same passions: most notably our passion for food and hospitality! I told Alexis about my cookbook and before we knew what happened, we were collaborating on Hospitality and Joy. It has become OUR baby as we work nights and weekends or grab a few minutes at lunch to collaborate and plan the next shoot! 
The Cookbook
There is little that gives me more joy than preparing a meal and sharing it with others. I am a feeder, plain and simple. A hostess to my core! As my grandmother would say, I “come by it honestly.” She, too, was a feeder. The lessons learned growing up in her kitchen shaped my life and set me on a path of cooking, sharing, serving and loving. 
On the morning she died in 2008 I sat down and began writing stories, never dreaming that years later I would bring that collection together with my own favorite recipes.  But here we are, I now have a book and I need your help to bring it to print. 
My good friend and food photographer, Alexis El Massih, and I have brought to life some amazing recipes for your family in a cookbook titled Hospitality and Joy. It is a beautifully designed 8.5"" x 10"" smythe-sewn hardbound book printed on heavy weight satin finish paper.  Ninety-six colorful pages feature my go-to, tried and true hostess recipes each illustrated in photos that are as beautiful to look at as the food is delicious! 
This book, nearly a decade in the making, honors my Sitey--my grandmother--""Aunt Vi"" as she was lovingly known to most, and celebrates an ethos of hospitality and joy that extends well beyond the kitchen.
What We Need & What You Get
This project is very personal to me. As a first-time author, seasoned graphic designer, and trusted curator/creator of these recipes, I decided to self-publish so that every detail would be exactly as I envisioned. It will cost $12,500 to produce and print 500 hard-bound copies of the first edition of Hospitality and Joy.

 My name is Jake dh.  In 2014, I released my first novel, The BulletProof Ghost: Prototypes.  The book was about a 13 year old boy named Kyle Richard. Kyle is killed when a group of bullies take their antics too far.  He is resurrected as a cybernetic killing machine by a mysterious man with clouded motivations.  Kyle has to figure out whether to be a tool of his creator or forge his own destiny.  
Though the book received glowing reviews, it was difficult to get the word out.  There were a lot of hurdles in terms of resources and my options were severely limited due to something as petty as money.



Now I'm nearing the completion of the second book in the series The BulletProof Ghost: In Spades, I've learned from my mistakes.  This campaign is not only about funding a book tour, but giving you perks that very few outside of this IndieGoGo will have access to.

   What We Need & What You Get  We need to cover printing costs, traveling, booking/booth fees and everything else associated with a book tour.  The more funding we get, the more we can get the word out about The BulletProof Ghost series.  This will lead to more stops, conventions, signings and quite possibly, a few extra perks not currently listed. 
On the flip side you can get: For lower contributions you get Button Pins, T-Shirts, Signed copies of BPG: In Spades, the compilation book (with an updated version of BPG: Prototypes included) BPG: Prototypes & Spades, Hardback Versions of both books.  For high contributors you can receive signed sketches of the characters, a full art book or even getting your name in the book as a supporting character!
 If we don't reach our goal, you will still get your reward.  That's right!  The goal is the minimum we need for a proper tour, but we will still have enough for your specific reward based on your contribution.  When we called this campaign Pre-Order BPG: In Spades, we meant it.
All contributors will have their name printed in a special thanks section of all versions of The BulletProof Ghost: In Spades.    The Impact  This book series is important, because the characters feel real.  They have a past, motivations and dreams of what they want their lives to be.  They are thrown into an insane situation, but keep trying, no matter what.   BPG is an independent novel series.  We are not a giant franchise with shareholders and multi-million dollar movies under our belt.  The characters in BPG are just as rich and interesting as any best selling series.  We just need a boost to get the word out. My word is everything.  I've personally been burned by people I've implicitly trusted.  Trusted on issues that were life changing and was let down when this person (or persons) turned out to be lying.  I would never do that to anyone.  I know how that feels.  If you pledge, I promise, you will get your reward.  The fact you are contributing is humbling, to say the least.  Thanks in advance.    

Risks & Challenges The book is written at this point, so there is no risk in that department.  The risk is that we won't be fully funded.    For you, this doesn't matter in the short run, you'll get your reward no matter what.  We've got you covered.  Putting books in people's hands is the most important thing at this point in any case. The tour and advertising plan will have to be scaled back.    Other Ways You Can Help If you cannot contribute monetarily, then you can:   Follow The BulletProof Ghost on Facebook, Twitter (@thebproofghost), Periscope (Jake dh #BPG #Author) or Instagram.  Favorite, like and share posts as much as you can.

She has been raising money for elephants for the last 2 years at market stalls. Now she wants to combine her two passions- creative writing and helping elephants to inspire other children to help elephants too. <br/></p>
<p>We would like to run a writing contest for children aged between 5-16 years to help raise awareness and funds to sponsor elephants in reputable elephant sanctuaries in Asia or Africa. We are raising funds to cover the cost of prizes so that we do not have to ask children to pay an entry fee. Entry fees may deter kids from entering. </p>
<p><b>The prizes that we would like to offer are: </b><br/></p>
<p><b>5-8years: Sponsorship/adoption of an elephant for one year + surprise pack</b></p>
<p><b>9-12 years: Sponsorship/adoption of an elephant for one year + surprise pack<br/></b></p>
<p><b>13-16 years: Sponsorship/adoption of an elephant for one year + surprise pack</b></p>
<p>Second prize for each category would be a surprise pack of elephant related items.Bethany would like to include<b> information about elephants, a poster, arm bands, postcards, and perhaps a toy elephant in the surprise pack. </b><br/></p>
<p>Sponsorship would only involve <b>reputable elephant sanctuaries</b> in either Africa or Asia. We would provide the winners with a range of organisations to choose from with the help of the charity known as Kids For Elephants, whom Bethany has been involved with since 2013.<br/></p>
<p>Bethany has entered several writing contests and been short-listed and also came second in the Laura Literary Awards in 2013. I would help Bethany to judge the writing contest. I am a qualified primary teacher, and also a publisher and editor who runs an adult writing competition each year. <br/></p>
<p>We would promote the competition through schools and through writer networks. Bethany will also write a blog and offer her knowledge of elephants and her journey as a fundraiser, as well as updates on the competition. <br/></p>
<p><i>If we received enough entries or more funding, we may also be able to offer selected stories/authors the opportunity to be printed in a book which could help raise further funds for elephants. </i><br/></p>
<p>Bethany became passionate about elephants at about 2 years of age. She was aware that her great grandfather was Burmese and lived with elephants, which captured her imagination. Her great grandfather and great grandmother collected hand made ornaments of elephants on their visits to Burma and Thailand. Bethany has inherited some of these ornaments recently. This year her great grandfather has passed away and we are making a special trip to Burma and Thailand to introduce Bethany to her ancestral roots and to give Bethany to opportunity to work with elephants. <br/></p>

Hi, I’m Dan Close, and I’m here to introduce you to my latest novel. I visited Quebec City for the first time in 1964, and found myself in the middle of what was to be called “Quebec’s Quiet Revolution”. That hot summer inspired this novel, “Song of Quebec”. The people I met, their ideas and ideals and their stories serve as the basis for the tale I want to share with you:
A United States government official is assassinated in the streets of Quebec City. Thus begins a story including intrigue, spies of many nations, revolutionaries, and romance that culminates in the great battle for Quebec sovereignty. This is not as far-fetched as it may seem. The Front de Liberation du Quebec (FLQ) actually had plans to kidnap the U S Consul-General of Montreal. While they did not succeed in this attempt, they did kidnap a British Trade Commissioner, and did murder the Quebec Minister of Labor. And when President of France Charles de Gaulle shouted in a speech in Montreal, “Vive La Quebec! Vive La Quebec Libre!”, it caused an international incident. These occurrences, along with the bombs, riots, and threats indicate that the “quiet” revolution was not really that quiet. It is against this background that the action of “Song of Quebec” occurs.
   What We Need & What You Get 
I need your help to make this novel a reality. So please take a look around, check out my perks, and read on. I’m looking to raise $5,500.00 to cover costs for this book. These include…Editing and Review $2250; Initial printing $1300; Marketing $1500; Miscellaneous costs/Indiegogo cut $450. I have some great perks to offer you in return for your help funding this book. For instance: $10 gets you a research directory guiding you through this period. $25 gets you an e-book copy of the book. $45 gets you a special first edition copy of the book, numbered and signed by the Author. If you’re feeling extra generous, $550.00 gets you two nights for two at a traditional upper-town hotel, the same one that our hero, Jack Kearney, stayed at (maybe, if you’re lucky, even the room he stayed in!). Also included is a carriage ride about town and a tour of action sites from the novel, led by the Author. Plus many more options!   The Impact 
The impact of the funding is primarily on the author and his ability to control the marketing of his project. I have written and marketed three books so far, and by now I have learned a lot. I know what to do, and where the levers of power are found in the publishing business. I also know the value of a good, comprehensive plan that includes traditional books, e-books, and offshoot versions of both. That plan must cover local, national, and international markets. It must be, at the beginning and throughout, an active campaign. It should contain enough capital to sustain it through its initial stages, until it begins to generate financial solidity on its own. It should not be done piecemeal, with the author doing this, that, and the other thing as money becomes available. While the campaign might be an emotional rollercoaster, the financial aspect of it must be a smooth-riding, seasoned, closer-to-reality vehicle.  In other words, it must be a campaign grounded in financial reality. I would like to start here, among my friends old and new, and among others who find the theme of the book attractive and have faith in my ability to carry the project through to success. And to reward my backers with perks. Neat perks! Don’t forget, you get some neat perks with this program!
    What if we don't reach our goal?
The most important parts of this venture are editing and publication. If we don’t reach our goal, whatever net amount we do obtain will be spent on those initial activities, and, of course, on the earned perks of our backers. We will keep all of our backers informed at the very least on a monthly basis of our progress, as of course we will also do if we reach our goal, or exceed it.
    Other Ways You Can Help 
If you can’t contribute but would still like to help, that’s great! I’d love to have your support in any form it might take. So, you might consider spreading the word among your friends about this campaign. Hopefully, if all goes well, we can make this book happen quickly and have it ready for the holiday season, where three-quarters of all copies of all books are sold. Thank you for your help, should you choose to give it. We are off on a great adventure! Please join us!Dan Close",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/><b><i>""If given the chance, we can all achieve great things."" ~Gabe</i></b><br/><br/>My name is Gabe Howard and I live with bipolar and anxiety disorders and <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I want to write a memoir that is unlike other memoirs. I want to write about my life through the lens of a regular guy living with bipolar disorder.  I want this to be the ""anti-memoir"" and I promise it </span><i style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">will not</i><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> include the following:</span>
</div><div>
<br/><ul>
<li>
<i>Celebrities!</i>  I'm not famous. I'm a regular person, just like my readers.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<i>Sensational stories of mania, spending, and debauchery!</i>  I was never arrested, didn't spend millions of dollars, and everything I went through could be duplicated if one has the desire to do so. (Though I don't recommend it.)<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>
<i>Bullsh*t!</i>  My story, and the stories of all the people I met along the way, are real. In the movie version, Hollywood would no doubt dress it up by playing sad music and asking Morgan Freeman to narrate, but at the end of the day, my life isn't pretty. It will all be there: the good, the bad, and the parts that still keep me up some nights. </li>
</ul>
<p>I will write a book that shows what day-to-day life before, during, and after a bipolar diagnosis looks like. Of course I displayed ""crazy"" manic behavior -- I assure you that drugs, alcohol, and sex were heavily involved. But, you'll be surprised at what that really looks like without pop culture's ""spit shine."" </p>
<p>I will showcase what worked, what didn't, and highlight the effect it had on my friends, family, and (of course) me. I'm not going to tell a story about life with bipolar disorder, I'm going to help the reader understand what it is like to live a life with bipolar disorder.</p>
<p><b>Anyone can write a book with themselves as the hero.</b> Since I'm an atypical person, it shouldn't be a surprise that I will produce an atypical book. If you want to read about a relatable, average person, who grew up blue collar middle class, went through a lot of sh*t, and emerged intact, then this will be the memoir for you.</p>
<div>Otherwise, I recommend Carrie Fisher's <i><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Wishful-Drinking-Carrie-Fisher/dp/143915371X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1447966768&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=wishful+drinking+paperback"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wishful Drinking</a></i>.

</h3>
<div>
<p>I need your support. Financial, emotional, and mental -- I need it all. However, I have created this fundraising page to ask you to support me financially.</p>
<p>Over the past five years, I have put up tens of thousands of dollars and thousands of hours of unpaid work. I need your support to get me to the finish line. </p>
<p><b>It may seem like I'm asking you to invest in this project, but I'm really asking you to invest in <i>me</i>.</b> <b>Together</b>, we can release a book that changes the way society sees people living with bipolar disorder and other mental illnesses. </p>
<p>Among the perks for your support are things like recognition in the book, early copies of the book, the ability to be a test reader, and bi-weekly updates. I'll sign your copy however you want. Donate enough and I'll hand deliver the completed product. </p>
<p><b>But, more than anything, you get to be a part of this project. You get to help me realize the dream of changing the way people see bipolar disorder. Every single person who reads this memoir will likely see bipolar in a different light. Because we are more than an illness. Society needs to see <i>everything </i>I've been through and that will help them understand. </b></p>
<p>You will get to help give life to my story that has so far taken 39 years to tell. (<i>Because I'm 39 years old. Try and keep up.</i>)</p>

<h3>What Will I do With Your Investment?</h3>
<p></p>This campaign is for the promotional side of this project: book blog tours, mailing out sample copies to reviewers and influencers, general advertising, etc. The greatest book in the world won't succeed if no one knows it exists.
<p></p>
Stretch goals include hiring a publicist to create a real world book tour to get me, and this book, in front of as many people as people. <b>The goal is to change the way people see those living with bipolar disorder, so they need to see me. They need to read what I have to say and they need to understand.</b>

Finally, 50% of the funds raised will go to credit card fees, shipping costs, and providing the products to fulfill the incentives for my backers. <b>People like <i>you</i>.

</div></div>","""If given the chance, we can all achieve great things."" ~GabeMy name is Gabe Howard and I live with bipolar and anxiety disorders and I want to write a memoir that is unlike other memoirs. I want to write about my life through the lens of a regular guy living with bipolar disorder.  I want this to be the ""anti-memoir"" and I promise it will not include the following:



Celebrities!  I'm not famous. I'm a regular person, just like my readers.


Sensational stories of mania, spending, and debauchery!  I was never arrested, didn't spend millions of dollars, and everything I went through could be duplicated if one has the desire to do so. (Though I don't recommend it.)


Bullsh*t!  My story, and the stories of all the people I met along the way, are real. In the movie version, Hollywood would no doubt dress it up by playing sad music and asking Morgan Freeman to narrate, but at the end of the day, my life isn't pretty. It will all be there: the good, the bad, and the parts that still keep me up some nights. 

I will write a book that shows what day-to-day life before, during, and after a bipolar diagnosis looks like. Of course I displayed ""crazy"" manic behavior -- I assure you that drugs, alcohol, and sex were heavily involved. But, you'll be surprised at what that really looks like without pop culture's ""spit shine."" 
I will showcase what worked, what didn't, and highlight the effect it had on my friends, family, and (of course) me. I'm not going to tell a story about life with bipolar disorder, I'm going to help the reader understand what it is like to live a life with bipolar disorder.
Anyone can write a book with themselves as the hero. Since I'm an atypical person, it shouldn't be a surprise that I will produce an atypical book. If you want to read about a relatable, average person, who grew up blue collar middle class, went through a lot of sh*t, and emerged intact, then this will be the memoir for you.
Otherwise, I recommend Carrie Fisher's Wishful Drinking. She's Princess Leia and her story is amazing. 







I am the previous author of Anxiety-Schmanxiety on HealthyPlace, the current author of Don't Call Me Crazy on PsychCentral.com (where I am also an Associate Editor), I write bi-weekly for bp magazine,  and am often featured on ElephantJournal.com. (I'm also the guy who wrote ""Mental Illness is an A**hole."" and ""3 Ways to Stop Blaming Yourself for Bipolar Disorder.)
I've won a stack of awards, too, for writing (Best of the Web Award), for advocacy (one was from Mental Health America), and for all I do to educate society. I was even a WEGO Health Finalist.  All of this is not to brag, but to show you that I know what I am doing. (Want to know more? Read my full bio here.)

This story takes the reader on a transparent ride through the main character, Brooklen Sapphire’s rocky upbringing, risky behavior, emotional abuse and so much more. The final straw of infidelity in her marriage prompts her to take a long, hard look in the mirror in order to break free of all the things holding her back from life’s best treasures – forgiveness, freedom and love. Brooklen’s narrative will show readers the connection between our imperfect childhoods and adult complexities. If you’re willing to roll up your sleeves and get dirty, then this story can ignite your very own love incorruptible – a journey that will teach you love in the most everlasting way.</p><p>My goal is to connect to the pain of my audience and lead them on a journey towards healing and self love. I don’t want anyone to think for a second that you have to be picture perfect to be used by God. We see some of the most incredible stories come from the people that have been tragically broken. You can experience darkness and still be worthy of the light. Again, the goal with releasing <i>Love Incorruptible</i> is to reach the people that are open to learning how facing into your pain can be liberating and most of all, used for a good purpose. Everything great begins with an inspiration. I believe this story will inspire others out of fear and into purpose.</p><h3>About the Author</h3><p>Jazmin Steele is a mother, women's empowerment and self-care advocate. She earned a bachelor degree in Business and has launched several companies as an entrepreneur.

</ul></div>","#SetBrooklenFREE CampaignSummary of the projectMy novel, Love Incorruptible: A Woman’s Reflective Journey to Freedom will help its readers connect the dots of their lifelong pain and hopefully consider joining the journey to personal freedom. This story takes the reader on a transparent ride through the main character, Brooklen Sapphire’s rocky upbringing, risky behavior, emotional abuse and so much more. The final straw of infidelity in her marriage prompts her to take a long, hard look in the mirror in order to break free of all the things holding her back from life’s best treasures – forgiveness, freedom and love. Brooklen’s narrative will show readers the connection between our imperfect childhoods and adult complexities. If you’re willing to roll up your sleeves and get dirty, then this story can ignite your very own love incorruptible – a journey that will teach you love in the most everlasting way.My goal is to connect to the pain of my audience and lead them on a journey towards healing and self love. I don’t want anyone to think for a second that you have to be picture perfect to be used by God. We see some of the most incredible stories come from the people that have been tragically broken. You can experience darkness and still be worthy of the light. Again, the goal with releasing Love Incorruptible is to reach the people that are open to learning how facing into your pain can be liberating and most of all, used for a good purpose. Everything great begins with an inspiration. I believe this story will inspire others out of fear and into purpose.About the AuthorJazmin Steele is a mother, women's empowerment and self-care advocate. She earned a bachelor degree in Business and has launched several companies as an entrepreneur. Jazmin's background in journalism and blogging opens creative doors to spread her message of hope, overcoming trauma and learning self love.

<h3>Lets Get Transgender Boys Childerns Books Into Our World!</h3>
<p>Hi Everyone, I'm Tiffany. I've put ""Ryder's Journey: Being Who HE Truly Is"" together after finding absolutely nothing on the internet or in stores about a transgender boy growing up. It's 2019 and it blows my mind that there aren't any books out there for our children growing up today. So I decided I was going to change this; thus, Ryder was born. I wrote about his journey from the day he was born until the time he begins kindergarten.</p>
<p>Supporting Ryder and sharing his story with your kids, family and friends will directly help LGBTQ+ youth who have been rejected by their families and loved ones. Your support represents you agreeing that every kid deserves to be able to pick up a children's book at a young age and find a character that they can relate to. Together we are teaching our family members, friends, communities, and schools that we are all born with one unique soul from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Raising money for ""Ryder's Journey"" will help tour this book. You will also allow ""Ryder's Journey"" to be published in hardcopy, making it easier to get into our libraries. You will be making it possible to continue his story as he starts kindergarten and continues his walk through life.</p>
<h3>Raising $10,000</h3>
<p>Where's this all going?</p>
<p>* To self publish ""Ryder's Journey"" in hardcopy (most libraries will only accept hardcopy books)</p>
<p>* Fund a US tour of ""Ryder's Journey"" in which the book would be exhibited at bookstores, libraries, and community centers nationwide. The tour would give the book the publicity it deserves and would offer support to any LGBTQ+ youth in audiences. </p>
<p>* Help me <i>self publish</i> Ryder's next journey in his life, going to kindergarten. I would love to explore Ryder's path as he gets older and begins his pre-teen to teenage years. These books would share the obstacles that cross his path and how he and those around him deal with them. </p>
<h3>Why Is ""Ryder's Journey"" So Important?</h3>
<p>""Ryder's Journey"" is a book for a little transgender boy who is trying to figure himself out. It would give them a character they can relate to. It would reassure transgender boys who hear everyone calling them a girl, but everything inside their body, heart and soul tells them, ""No, I'm not a girl at all! I'm a boy, I real boy!"" that this is a totally okay feeling to feel.</p>
<p>This book is also for kids who are cisgender (people who identify with the body they were born in), and would help them learn acceptance for friends or family members that are transgender. ""Ryder's Journey"" will educate these kids and their parents on what it means to be transgender.</p>
<p>We know who we are from day one, but need to learn how to communicate our identify. By 3-4 years old, kids develop these skills and can verbalize who they are. However, when these kids see rows of ""girl"" and ""boy"" toys and are told they may only enjoy specific things, they begin to question whether they even want to continue living. Transgender kids as young as 6 are attempting to commit suicide - this is heartbreaking and must be stopped.</p>
<p>There must be more diversity in children's books for our young kids. Every child should have a book that they can relate to growing up. I want to be a part of that change and help kids grow up in an environment where they feel safe being their authentic self.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>There will always be those who think a transgender child's book is wrong, against what they believe in, or something children should not be reading.</p>
<p>I believe these people are the ones hiding from their true selves. There are many reasons why they might think this way, ranging from their upbringing to their development in life. These families commonly neglect their children's interests in favor for their own vision of what encompasses a ""good life.""</p>
<p>I feel bad for these kinds of people. I cannot imagine the fear they must feel, knowing they can never express their true selves or break our societal norms. I cannot imagine what it must feel like to have everything you know built around these constructs and myths.</p>
<p>It's 2019 and time for change. We don't live in the 50's or 60's and must constantly evolve to accept those around us. Those reluctant to change must learn to educate themselves for the benefit of their children and their community.</p>
<p>For those of you who don't understand what it means to be transgender, I implore you to read ""Ryder's Journey: Being Who HE Truly Is"" because it will educate you and help you understand what being transgender really means. Look outside your box, step out of your comfort zone (just a little) and check it out. What you find may surprise you.</p>

Tell your friends and family about ""Ryder's Journey""! <u>Tell all of <strong>your</strong> people to tell <strong>their</strong> people!</u>!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Talyne Corlyn - Author, Publisher, Singer, Songwriter, Community Volunteer. Former owner of Meadow Lakes Publishing Company and publisher of a small local news magazine called Meadow Lakes Press.  Strong background in working with the public as an instructor, performer, life coach, on-air personality, mentor and recreational program director.</li>
<li>Steve Belka - Musician and Storyteller. Former owner Love of Alaska Remodeling and Construction Company. Strong background in building and design, equipment maintenance, basic bookkeeping skills.</li>
<li>Our campaign is to restart the company under the name Verde River Publishing after the other business had to close due to illness. It's a way for us to start our life over after dialysis, two organ transplants and Steve surviving cancer. We've worked very hard to be strong enough to make it through those challenges so that we could work again.</li>
<li>This company will not only help us but others who have faced adversity and survived stronger! By publishing their stories we can possibly inspire and motivate others to help themselves or their fellow citizens. We'll launch the Women's Voices Project in the spring, enlisting women from all walks of life to share their writing.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We seek funds in the amount of $32,000 to purchase wire and perfect (paperbacks) binding and printing equipment, new computer  and software for publishing, paper, cover paper and office supplies, start-up costs for incorporation, state and local licenses and taxes, insurance, communication, stipend, a merchant account for accepting credit cards, and marketing. A complete breakdown of the costs is available in the full business plan and backers can contact me for a copy.</li>
<li>This company is not only a business venture, it is an investment in community and bridge building. By relaying our stories we hope to enrich and motivate, uplift and spark laughter. More companies are adopting this business model and finding it can be profitable. The journals we featured were extremely popular with our old company. They are unique and can be designed specifically for the user. The photography and art we use is captivating, much of the photography from Alaska. Our fiction stories are intriguing, bringing exciting new storylines to the page. We have a number of stories featuring LGBTQ themes explored in a slightly different way. Hurry Up and Wait and Catching Serendipity are two books that are out of print because we sold every copy before the illnesses. Two very good books waiting to be republished in updated 2nd Editions</li>
<li>In the event that our target funding goal is not met, we will put what we do raise into equipment first. We will adjust by designing a smaller shop, find refurbished equipment instead of purchasing new, or lease it, and by shaving some off of the larger marketing ideas.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Negative information and stories in the news have increased dramatically in the last 20 – 30 years.  This almost constant barrage of negativity can cause stress, which, in turn can lead to low productivity due to an individuals personal reaction to that negativity.  These societal ills have a detrimental effect on the community at large, which in turn affect local business. We all win when the community is stronger. Though we realize that sheltering ourselves from bad news is impossible, it is our mission to be a leader in the positive news arena and believe that this business model will assist in helping the company grow. We are witnessing resurgence in the millennium old passion for stories and storytelling. Not just as a recreational art form, indeed, some see a need to relay what is happening to them, their family, neighbor and friends. Many voices are longing to be heard and sadly, many of them have no way to accomplish this. By giving them a voice we build confidence and confidence, coupled with compassion, builds strong communities.</li>
<li>I published a local good news magazine, which won 1st Place - Personal Achievement category in the 2007 Alaska Professional Communicators Contest. Written articles and designed recreation curriculum acknowledged by our then governor, Steve Cowper, twice. I was a columnist and reporter for The Frontiersman Newspaper in The Matanuska Susitna Borough, Alaska. The first three books I published myself received great reviews and all printed copies are sold out.</li>
<li>This has been a dream and goal I set for myself while I was on the transplant list. Our retirement was wiped out due to the medical situations in our lives and we are determined to rewrite current history to what we want it to read. We are giving all we have to this and are all in.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>Because we have dealt with so much adversity, the type that sends people into despair, we certainly possess the knowledge and determination to enter this with certitude. The greatest failure is to give up and not try at all.  Having said that, the challenge will be to get the trust of the community to purchase advertising in our magazine and retailers willing to carry our inventory. In today's publishing market retailers are inundated with cartons of books and publications. The goal is to stand out from all the rest.</li>
<li>It is our intention to connect with the community by partnering with businesses, agencies and organizations that are hosting events. Getting retailers to review and carry the inventory will take personal and ongoing communication with each retailer, offering unique storylines and attractive, captivating covers. We plan to do a great deal of personal events for further exposure. personal connection is the way that almost 2/3rds of buyers today purchase products.</li>

<p>Guatemala está pasando por un momento clave en su historia. Una lucha por la justicia y la democracia. Una batalla contra la corrupción y la impunidad. Los poderosos necesitan ser fiscalizados y los ciudadanos necesitan información y contexto para cambiar el sistema. </p>

<h3><b>¿Qué necesitamos?<br/>¿Qué vas a ganar?</b></h3>

<p><span>Necesitamos financiar dos meses de salarios del equipo increíble de 16 jóvenes que hace posible Nómada (con muchísimo trabajo). Esto nos permitirá seguir hacer periodismo, seguir construyendo una comunidad y conseguir fondos para otro año de periodismo, como hicimos en los últimos 15 meses. </span></p>A cambio recibirás uno de los libros de los primeros 140 días de la revolución pacífica guatemalteca.

<p>346 reportajes y posts sobre política y 304 reportajes y posts sobre cotidianidad. </p>
<p>Google Analytics registró que recibimos 4,218,681 visitas de 1,507,315 usuarios. Como el 80 por ciento de las visitas son desde Guatemala, podemos afirmar que hemos llegado prácticamente a la mitad de los usuarios de internet del país.  </p>Pero más importante que los números, hemos aportado a construir una nueva generación de lectores y ciudadanos, que se informan en Nómada para hacer su propia visión de esta Guatemala que quiere la primavera. Aquí, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAgDl-Awyw8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">un video</a> de un minuto de la última actividad con la comunidad de lectores, a quienes les entregamos un libro con fotos de manifestantes y textos de Nómada. <br/><p></p>
<p><span>Por medio de investigaciones periodísticas hemos metido <a href=""https://nomada.gt/historico-jueza-envia-a-la-carcel-a-todos-los-acusados-por-el-caso-igss-incluidos-personajes-muy-poderosos/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">a la cárcel a corruptos</a>, <a href=""https://nomada.gt/record-de-baldizon-14-5-mentiras-en-7-23-minutos-en-cnn/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">frenado embusteros</a>, <a href=""https://nomada.gt/ranking-de-poder/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">fiscalizado a poderosos</a> y <a href=""https://nomada.gt/la-historia-del-astronauta-guatemalteco-que-nunca-fue-astronauta/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">desenmascarado estafadores</a>.

<p>Y hemos colocado <a href=""https://nomada.gt/a-la-mierda-tu-feminismo/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">el feminismo</a> y las reivindicaciones de equidad de género sobre la mesa de debate en Guatemala. </p>
<p>Hemos hecho todo esto sin renunciar a nuestros principios de transparencia institucional (con <a href=""http://nomada.gt/quienes-somos/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">todos los socios y donantes públicos</a>). </p>
<b><h3>Los riesgos<br/>Los retos</h3></b><p><span>Buscar la verdad no es tan sexy cuando uno fiscaliza a los poderosos.

Por eso estamos en proceso de construir un modelo de negocios.  Un modelo con varias fuentes de ingresos –lectores, fundaciones, patrocinios y eventos–. El mes pasado hicimos un evento lúdico para acercar a la comunidad de lectores y empezamos a monetizarlo.

<h3>In English<br/>Short Summary</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>Nómada is the voice of a generation bent on bringing forth the Guatemalan Spring.</span></p>
<p>Guatemala is going through a decisive point in its history. A struggle for Justice and Democracy. A battle against corruption and impunity. The practices of powerful need to be monitored, and citizens need information and context to change the system. </p>This is impossible without brave, independent journalism.  <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>We need to finance two months of salaries for the amazing team, made up of 16 young bright minds. They make Nómada possible through their hard work, late nights and compromise. This will allow us to continue building a community, to get more funds for another year of journalism, the way we have been doing it the last 15 months. </span></p>In exchange you get one copy of the book 140 Days of Spring, which narrates the pacific Guatemalan revolution. And if you donate a little bit more you get VIP tickets to all of Nómada’s events in 2016; six over-the-top parties, conferences, forums and workshops. Plus, you get to have a sit down dinner with the amazing team we mentioned before. 
<br/><br/><ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>Between August 7th, 2014 and November 14th 2015 we have produced </span></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">346 coverage and articles on national and global politics</span></li>

</ul>
<p>Since we launched in August 2014 we have received 4,218, 681 visits from 1,507, 315 users*. Given that 80% of our visits are in Guatemala, we can say we’ve reached half of the country’s internet users. *(According to Google Analytics)</p>
<p>More than numbers, we have been able to contribute to develop a new generation of readers and citizens that want to be informed through Nómada. Our readers think for themselves and form their own perception of this Guatemala that is thirsty for Spring.  The last time we reached out to our community, we asked them to send us their photographs of the civil marches and demonstrations, we printed them and turned them into a book. This book, 140 Days of Spring, tells the story of the people who raised its voice, and roared.

Lo básico

Nómada es el medio de la generación que está construyendo la primavera guatemalteca.
Guatemala está pasando por un momento clave en su historia. Una lucha por la justicia y la democracia. Una batalla contra la corrupción y la impunidad. Los poderosos necesitan ser fiscalizados y los ciudadanos necesitan información y contexto para cambiar el sistema. 
Esto es imposible sin periodismo valiente.

¿Qué necesitamos?¿Qué vas a ganar?


Necesitamos financiar dos meses de salarios del equipo increíble de 16 jóvenes que hace posible Nómada (con muchísimo trabajo). Esto nos permitirá seguir hacer periodismo, seguir construyendo una comunidad y conseguir fondos para otro año de periodismo, como hicimos en los últimos 15 meses. A cambio recibirás uno de los libros de los primeros 140 días de la revolución pacífica guatemalteca. Y si donás un poco más, también pases libres para nuestras 6 fiestas de 2016 y una cena con el equipo de Nómada.Además de donar a través de esta plataforma, podés hacer un depósito a esta cuenta: BANRURALCUENTA MONETARIA #3445513698 A nombre de Nopeva, S.A.:)(Por favor envianos una foto de tu DPI y tu depósito a nomada@nomada.gt, para que te agreguemos a la lista de lectores-donantes.)


¿Qué impacto hemos tenido?

Entre el 7 de agosto de 2014 y el 14 de noviembre de 2015, hemos producido 
346 reportajes y posts sobre política y 304 reportajes y posts sobre cotidianidad. 
Google Analytics registró que recibimos 4,218,681 visitas de 1,507,315 usuarios. Como el 80 por ciento de las visitas son desde Guatemala, podemos afirmar que hemos llegado prácticamente a la mitad de los usuarios de internet del país.  Pero más importante que los números, hemos aportado a construir una nueva generación de lectores y ciudadanos, que se informan en Nómada para hacer su propia visión de esta Guatemala que quiere la primavera. Aquí, un video de un minuto de la última actividad con la comunidad de lectores, a quienes les entregamos un libro con fotos de manifestantes y textos de Nómada. 
Por medio de investigaciones periodísticas hemos metido a la cárcel a corruptos, frenado embusteros, fiscalizado a poderosos y desenmascarado estafadores. Hemos llegado a CNN, el New York Times, Al Jazeera, Fohla de Sao Paulo, Vice y Huffington Post. 
Y hemos colocado el feminismo y las reivindicaciones de equidad de género sobre la mesa de debate en Guatemala. 
Hemos hecho todo esto sin renunciar a nuestros principios de transparencia institucional (con todos los socios y donantes públicos). 
Los riesgosLos retosBuscar la verdad no es tan sexy cuando uno fiscaliza a los poderosos. Los poderosos que tienen todo el dinero para anunciarse en medios. Por eso estamos en proceso de construir un modelo de negocios.  Un modelo con varias fuentes de ingresos –lectores, fundaciones, patrocinios y eventos–. El mes pasado hicimos un evento lúdico para acercar a la comunidad de lectores y empezamos a monetizarlo. Aquí el video de un minuto.  


Lo que dicen sobre Nómada“Medios independientes como Nómada devuelven la esperanza de un futuro en el que el periodismo sea algo más que una industria contaminante que lanza vertidos a la sociedad”. DELIA RODRÍGUEZ, periodista autora del libro Memecracia.
“Nuestros socios más fuertes en Centroamérica. Su coraje nos ha enorgullecido en el momento en el que fue necesario: en todo momento”. JULIAN ASSANGE, director de WikiLeaks.
“Una de las mejores maneras de crear una sociedad más pacífica, próspera e igualitaria es apoyar proyectos como Nómada”. ROSS SETTLES, asesor en el MDIF.
“Es raro conocer periodistas tan dedicados a buscar la verdad. Nómada cree que el periodismo independiente e investigativo puede empoderar a las personas para mantener a sus líderes a raya. Representa un paso adelante para cambiar la realidad de miedo en una nación hermosa y resilente: una misión llena de coraje”.HANNAH WALLACE-BOWMAN, periodista de Radio Nederland, antes en Safe Passage.
“Quiero felicitarlos por el buen trabajo en Nómada. He estado leyendo la mayoría de mis noticias allí y estoy bastante impresionado”. LUIS VON AHN, Tecnólogo guatemalteco.

In EnglishShort Summary 
Nómada is the voice of a generation bent on bringing forth the Guatemalan Spring.
Guatemala is going through a decisive point in its history. A struggle for Justice and Democracy. A battle against corruption and impunity. The practices of powerful need to be monitored, and citizens need information and context to change the system. This is impossible without brave, independent journalism.  
  What We Need & What You Get 
We need to finance two months of salaries for the amazing team, made up of 16 young bright minds. They make Nómada possible through their hard work, late nights and compromise. This will allow us to continue building a community, to get more funds for another year of journalism, the way we have been doing it the last 15 months. In exchange you get one copy of the book 140 Days of Spring, which narrates the pacific Guatemalan revolution. And if you donate a little bit more you get VIP tickets to all of Nómada’s events in 2016; six over-the-top parties, conferences, forums and workshops. Plus, you get to have a sit down dinner with the amazing team we mentioned before. 
    The Impact 
Between August 7th, 2014 and November 14th 2015 we have produced 


346 coverage and articles on national and global politics
304 articles on quotidianity and micro politics.

Since we launched in August 2014 we have received 4,218, 681 visits from 1,507, 315 users*. Given that 80% of our visits are in Guatemala, we can say we’ve reached half of the country’s internet users. *(According to Google Analytics)
More than numbers, we have been able to contribute to develop a new generation of readers and citizens that want to be informed through Nómada. Our readers think for themselves and form their own perception of this Guatemala that is thirsty for Spring.  The last time we reached out to our community, we asked them to send us their photographs of the civil marches and demonstrations, we printed them and turned them into a book. This book, 140 Days of Spring, tells the story of the people who raised its voice, and roared. We made a video and you can watch it here.

Throughout investigative journalism we have imprisoned corrupt politicians, stopped tricksters, watchdogged the powerful and unmasked embezzlers. We have brought feminism and gender equality to be discussed in the political agenda in Guatemala. We have been featured in CNN, the New York Times, Al Jazeera, Fohla de Sao Paulo, Vice and The Huffington Post.We have done all this without sacrificing institutional transparency with our partners and public donors. 

Risks & Challenges Searching for truth is not that cool when you’re watchdogging the powerful. Those who have the money to pay for ads in digital media. That’s why we are in the process of developing a strong business model with many income sources: readers, foundations, sponsorship and events (last month we threw a killer Halloween Party).

Dear parents and contributors,
We are Micah and Katie Smith and we are the proud parents of two amazing kids! Micah is a Los Angeles based Director, Producer and Photographer and Katie is a Child Development Specialist, Writer, Speaker and Parenting Coach.
 

 
 
In 2012, Katie was diagnosed with high grade brain cancer. At that time there was not a lot of things she could do to help improve her health. One of the few things she could control though, was the way she lived her life going forward. The first thing she did was to radically change the way she and her family ate. A self confessed “junk food junkie”, she immediately cut out all sugar, soda and junk food of any kind and switched to organic, healthy alternatives.
 

 
It was a drastic change, but she was highly motivated! Getting the children on board with the plan was a bit more of a challenge. With Halloween approaching, she and Micah wanted to find inventive ways to keep the fun but avoid so much sugar.
That's when the idea of Sweets The Witch was born! 
Our book Sweets The Witch and Her Sweetswitch is meant to inspire families to choose a healthy way of living and to help decrease the amount of sugar our children are consuming.
Sweets the Witch solves the problem of having too much candy consumed and leftover on Halloween. By asking children to trade some or all of their candy for a toy or surprise, Sweets gets the candy she craves and the children get their special wish granted while still enjoying the fun of dressing up and trick or treating. 
On Halloween night Sweets the Witch will do a SweetSwitch, trading out some, or all of your child's candy for a special toy or wish. It can be an outing or activity such as a movie or bowling, or it can be a toy they've been wanting. The more candy they trade, the better the wish, but it must be a fair trade! This is a wonderful Halloween family tradition that our children look forward to every year!
Your contribution will help us create a prototype for a Sweets The Witch doll, which will then be made into an actual doll that children can hold, touch, play with and even take trick or treating! Our doll will also have places for kids to put their fingers so that they can move Sweets' arms and hands so she can hold and pick things up. She is an interactive doll!  Sweets The Witch isn't monitoring your child to see if they've been good or bad, Sweets loves all children! Also, children get to have a say in what they would like to trade their candy for.
Along with our doll, We need to design and create the packaging that will include our book, Sweets The Witch and Her SweetSwitch, as well as a mini cauldron to put their wish in on Halloween night. We are also working on a CD that will include original Halloween songs written and sung by the fabulously talented Julia Albert! If we can complete the recordings we will include the CD in our packaging. All of this takes money, and we need your help! After being diagnosed with cancer Katie was not able to go back to work, creating Sweets The Witch with Micah has become a blessing, giving her a much needed creative outlet as well as a way to still help parents and kids.
By contributing to our campaign you will help make our dreams come true and we will reward you with PERKS! Contributions small and large will receive things like a special hand signed, personal note from Sweets, signed books, a CD of our original songs, a doll or the whole package!
We hope to inspire you to fill your children up with love and to make new and fun traditions that will give them the best start in life.
Thank you!!

about the journey of Halima who wants to reach the Land of Rain, in order to
bring the rainclouds back to her land, the Land of the Sun, where there is a
terrible drought, and where the people are no longer happy. In order to reach
the Land of Rain, Halima has to go through many countries<a href=""http://thejourneyofhalima.com/characters/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> where she makes many new friends</a>.<br/></p>

</p><p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>The Story</b></p>
<p>Meet Max! Max has a fear that is very common with kids his age. Max is afraid of MONSTERS! Every night when he crawls into bed he can see the monsters in his closet and their shadows on the walls. One morning when Max wakes up, he finds a box at the foot of his bed. Inside the box he finds a book with something tucked underneath. Once he moves the book he quickly realizes what he sees… a monster! This monster was different than the others that Max knows. In fact, the orange and furry monster explains to Max that monsters aren’t there to scare him, they simply are looking for a new friend. After Max learns about the monsters, he decides to name his new monster Harry Bumpkin. Harry and Max become the best of friends. At night, when Max is afraid, Harry is awake under the bed waiting to keep the monsters out. This helps Max to never be afraid of monsters again!</p>
<p>By reading our fun and adventurous storybook, children and their parents will learn how Max overcomes his fear of monsters by getting to know one. It is our hope that through this fun adventure, your child will be able to start overcoming their nighttime fears also!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460320069/12262043_fuxw0m.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

<p>And if nothing special catches your eye but you still want to support our cause, you can donate any amount you choose to the campaign.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>WHO WE ARE</b></p>
<p>Our duo includes a crazy dad who loves to write (Jeremy) and an amazing children's illustrator (Linda). Jeremy wrote this story for his son, Brycen. While the story was fun, Linda brought it to life! We want to share our story with your family so you can create your own bedtime tradition. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460320273/image1_blls1h.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p><b>WHY A STORYBOOK?</b></p>
<p>Everyone has a story from their childhood that they love to remember. We believe that My Monster Under the Bed is one of those very special stories that will help create long lasting memories. We also believe that this story will help children to engage the concepts of diversity and acceptance. The pictures are bright, the characters are loveable and the story is rhythmic and fun! </p>
<p>My Monster Under the Bed is a classic tale of two unlikely best friends. It is a tale of friendship and overcoming fear that teaches young readers how to accept each other, even if they are different. </p>
<p>To make the story real, we are creating an 8"" plush Harry Bumpkin monster doll that the children can keep in their closet or under their beds. Parents can use the monster to help teach children not to be afraid and to have a more calm bedtime experience. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460320305/icon_et2p1y.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>
</p><p><b>WHY WE NEED YOU</b></p>
<p>We have invested a lot of time, energy and resources into this story. What started as a fun tradition between the author and his son has turned into an opportunity to for children everywhere to have a new bedtime tradition. In order to bring the story to the capacity needed, we need your help. </p>
<p>We have already completed the story, the illustration, and the website for the story. We have even created the original Harry Bumpkin plush monster. Now we need you! We need your help in getting this fun story mass produced. With your help, we will meet our goal and you will get some AWESOME perks!</p>
<p><b>Breakdown of budget</b></p>
<p>•$3,730 Printing (1,000 hardcopy books at $3.73 per unit)</p>
<p>•$5,625 Plush prototype design and production (750 plush monsters at $7.50 per unit)</p>
<p>•Plush child safety and product quality testing and certification (included in monster design and production)</p>
<p>•$1,750 Book and plush packaging</p>
<p>•$1,250 Indiegogo and Paypal fees</p>

After Max learns about the monsters, he decides to name his new monster Harry Bumpkin. Harry and Max become the best of friends. At night, when Max is afraid, Harry is awake under the bed waiting to keep the monsters out. This helps Max to never be afraid of monsters again!
By reading our fun and adventurous storybook, children and their parents will learn how Max overcomes his fear of monsters by getting to know one. It is our hope that through this fun adventure, your child will be able to start overcoming their nighttime fears also!

WHO WE ARE
Our duo includes a crazy dad who loves to write (Jeremy) and an amazing children's illustrator (Linda). Jeremy wrote this story for his son, Brycen. While the story was fun, Linda brought it to life! We want to share our story with your family so you can create your own bedtime tradition. 
WHY A STORYBOOK?
Everyone has a story from their childhood that they love to remember. We believe that My Monster Under the Bed is one of those very special stories that will help create long lasting memories. We also believe that this story will help children to engage the concepts of diversity and acceptance. The pictures are bright, the characters are loveable and the story is rhythmic and fun! 
My Monster Under the Bed is a classic tale of two unlikely best friends. It is a tale of friendship and overcoming fear that teaches young readers how to accept each other, even if they are different. 
To make the story real, we are creating an 8"" plush Harry Bumpkin monster doll that the children can keep in their closet or under their beds. Parents can use the monster to help teach children not to be afraid and to have a more calm bedtime experience. 

WHY WE NEED YOU
We have invested a lot of time, energy and resources into this story. What started as a fun tradition between the author and his son has turned into an opportunity to for children everywhere to have a new bedtime tradition. In order to bring the story to the capacity needed, we need your help. 
We have already completed the story, the illustration, and the website for the story. We have even created the original Harry Bumpkin plush monster. Now we need you! We need your help in getting this fun story mass produced. With your help, we will meet our goal and you will get some AWESOME perks!
Breakdown of budget
•$3,730 Printing (1,000 hardcopy books at $3.73 per unit)
•$5,625 Plush prototype design and production (750 plush monsters at $7.50 per unit)
•Plush child safety and product quality testing and certification (included in monster design and production)
•$1,750 Book and plush packaging
•$1,250 Indiegogo and Paypal fees

<h3>So, what is Holl &amp; Lane?</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Sarah and I'm the creator and Editor in Chief of Holl &amp; Lane Magazine.  I created this magazine in April 2015 after noticing a lack of media talking about the issues so many of us can relate to.  We're taught to hide the hard parts of life behind a pretty Instagram filter, when in fact, those parts are what connect us to one another.  They are what make us who we are.  We shouldn't be ashamed. </p>
<p>Holl &amp; Lane has become more than a magazine. The community of women (and men!) that have rallied behind our mission of support, honesty, and love have found a lifeline in us.  Women from all around the world have developed friendships within our community and have found solace in our pages.</p>
<p>We want to be able to continue producing a high quality, well polished magazine and also begin to explore other avenues to connect our readers.  When you support our campaign, you're not only helping our little business to grow, you're helping us to reach new women who need to hear that someone understands exactly what they're going through.  You're helping us to promote honest media in a beautiful way.  And you're helping a small-town girl with a dream help others find their way.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>How you can help us...</h3>
<p>With the money raised, you'll help us create a whole year of beautiful issues.  The printing and shipping costs of a magazine are extremely high, especially when your pages are thick and luxurious (our magazine is often compared to a coffee table book).  With the money from this campaign, we'll be able to keep our magazine ad free and instead focus on what is inside.</p>
<p>$18,000 is a lot of money.  But it only truly scratches the surface of what it takes to run a magazine for a year.  Currently, with printing the bare minimum number of issues each quarter, it still costs nearly $5000 to print and ship each issue.  If we don't raise the full amount, we will still be able to use the money raised to put towards our upcoming issues and allow us to get back to focusing on our community, rather than on the sales.</p>
<p>We'll also be able to do the things we've been dreaming of - donating copies of the magazine to women's shelters and college campuses to reach women when they need to know they're not alone.  We'll be able to host events and retreats to have heartfelt connections in person.  And most importantly, we'll be able to keep going.  </p>

<h3>Why we're different...</h3>
<p>One of our readers had this to say about Holl &amp; Lane, and we think it perfectly sums up what we are trying to do:</p>
<p><i>Holl &amp; Lane isn't a magazine. Sure, it looks that way. It has stories and a couple ads and pages to turn (or the ability to swipe if you're a digital reader type of person) but there's more to H&amp;L than just that. </i></p>
<p><i>When you think magazine, you think glossy pages at the end of a grocery store checkout aisle with some celebrity face on it, selling the latest beauty product, and telling you how to make your body look different so your sex life can be better. </i></p>
<p><i><strong>H&amp;L isn't that. </strong></i></p>
<p><i>Beyond the thick, matte pages and simplistic cover design (that is clearly worthy of any coffee table) are evergreen stories about real life, strength, and perseverance. There are stories that say, ""I've been where you are right now, and there are reasons you're going through this, and here's a way to pull yourself out of the pit you might be in."" </i></p>
<p><i><strong>This isn't a magazine. This is a lifeline.</strong> This is someone, somewhere, saying you are not alone. This is a revolution to show women, you are perfect as you are and there are other women just like you who have been standing right where you feel you are right now. It's just that now, because of H&amp;L, you know you are not standing there alone. - Chelsea </i></p>

We highlight <a href=""http://openfest.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">OPEN festival </a>- the largest libertarian festival in Europe; local <a href=""https://www.studentsforliberty.org/europe/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ESFL</a> conferences; the documentary film <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bnicOqt1o6E"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""Economy""</a>; ""Catalaxy"" seminars and numerous other projects. So far we've published several books - Islam and the Free Market (Čavalić &amp; Smajić); The Economics of Freedom (Palmer); Introduction to Objectivism (Vrtarić) and The Essential HAYEK (Boudreaux). Now we want to issue our next book, which is ""<i>Capitalism and Freedom</i>"" by Milton Friedman.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we want to translate it?</strong></p>
<p>This is what we consider to be our capital project because so far ""<i>Capitalism and Freedom</i>"" has not been translated into Bosnian. For this very reason, libertarian culture has not developed enough, especially among the intellectuals. Namely, the intellectual elites lack the basis of reference to which they would build their models of social change. Without this, they turn to socialism and other types of interventionism, which in the long run makes the country poorer.</p>
<p><strong>What are we going to do?</strong></p>
<p>With $ 4,000 support, we will do the translation of the book ""<i>Capitalism and Freedom</i>"" into Bosnian. The book will be printed and published by our organization, and we will organize several promotions in the largest cities of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Most importantly, the book will be shared with universities, libraries, but also decision-makers, opinion leaders, and the like. Book will not be commercially sold, so all the copies will be delivered for free (yes we know that there is no free lunch, but we need to make compromises). It is important to note that we will give special attention to who receives the book (we prefer people from academia, entrepreneurs, politicians, youtube stars, people from media, and other celebrities). </p>
<p><strong>Is it worth it?</strong></p>
<p>All in all, every dollar will be spent on the book itself and on our mission of spreading the ideas of liberty in Bosnia and Herzegovina. We are well-known as an organization that is achieving excellent cost-benefit when it comes to promoting the ideas of liberty (best known by our partners such as Students For Liberty, Atlas Network, Friedrich von Naumman Foundation and others). That is why we are looking for your support. If you have any questions regarding our cause, please let us know.</p>

<p>Udruženje građana ""Multi"" je pionirska i najveća libertarijanska organizacija u Bosni i Hercegovini. Osnovana je 2011. godine i dosada je realizovala niz uspješnih projekata usmjernih na promociji ideja slobode u Bosni i Hercegovini, ali i regionu Zapadnog Balkana. Izdvajamo OPEN festival - najveći libertarijanski festival u Evropi; domaće ESFL konferencije; dokumentarni film ""Ekonomija""; ""Katalaksija"" seminare i brojne druge projekte. Dosada smo izdali nekoliko knjiga - Islam i slobodno tržište (Čavalić/Smajić); Ekonomija slobode (Palmer), Uvod u objektivizam (Vrtarić) i Hayek, osnove (Boudreaux). Sada želim izdati našu sljedeću knjigu, a to je ""Kapitalizam i sloboda"" od Milton Friedmana.</p>
<p><strong>Zašto prevodimo knjigu?</strong></p>
<p>Ovo smatramo našim kapitalnim projektom jer dosada ova knjiga nije prevođena na bosanski jezik. Upravo zbog toga se nije dovoljno razvila libertarijanska kultura, naročito među intelektualcima. Naime, intelektualne elite nemaju baznih izvora na koje bi se referisali i na osnovu kojih bi gradili svoje modele promjene društva. Zbog toga nerijetko potežu za socijalizmom i drugim intervencionističkim ideologijama.</p>
<p><strong>Šta planiramo uraditi?</strong></p>
<p>Sa 4000 dolara podrške, uradit ćemo prevod knjige ""Kapitalizam i sloboda"" na bosanski jezik. Knjiga će se štampati i izdati u našoj organizaciji, te ćemo organizovati nekoliko promocija u najvećih gradovima Bosne i Hercegovine. Ono što je najvažnije je da će se knjiga podijeliti univerzitetima, bibliotekama, ali također i donosiocima odluka, liderima mišljenja i slično. Pritom ćemo voditi računa da knjigu dobiju oni koji će od nje imati koristi i koji će dalje moći širiti ove ideje.</p>
<p><strong>Da li se isplati?</strong></p>
<p>Dakle, svaki dolar će biti potrošen na samu knjigu i na našu misiju širenja ideja slobode u Bosni i Hercegovini. Poznati smo kao organizacija koja vodi računa o tome da se svaki dolar potroši namjensi i da najviše doprinese promociji ideja slobode. Upravo zbog toga tražimo vašu podršku.

<h3>Beware the Femme Fatal</h3>
<p>We're writing a picture book on Film Noir and its important life lessons. Everything that you could possibly need to know about life can be learned through this film genre that is so quintessentially American.</p>

<h3>John and Katherine</h3>
<p>John is a life-long archeologist and film buff who has been running the blog and podcast Classic Movie Reviews with Snark for several years and he's learned a lot doing it. Now in what he calls the ""back nine"" of life, he's discovered that Film Noir is the key! Katherine is a bit younger but has an appreciation for the arts and film. Together, we've created a project we think is worth your time! </p>
<h3>What is Film Noir?</h3>
<p>Film Noir is a term that was applied to a subset of American films by French film critics following World War II, literally meaning ""black film"". The French were cut off from American film during the war, so when the films started coming in again, they noticed the mood was no longer escapist like those films from the Depression era. It had turned dark and moody, maybe a little cynical, but it had a few things to teach us.</p>
<h3>Why is this important?</h3>
<p>We believe in this project. It's cute, it's funny, it's educational. We have an amazingly talented artist working with us to bring this book to life. Of course, art has a huge value and we want to bring the final results to the people. Hence, this campaign. All proceeds will go toward funding the art necessary to get the book off the ground. Every little bit helps and we will move forward with the book no matter what because we believe it's important to share with the world!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that money is tight--that's why we're asking for help--so if you can't toss some coins our way, no problem! There are other ways for you guys to help us:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share our campaign with your friends and family on Facebook, Twitter, and any other social medium you could think of.</li>
<li>Know any film buffs or people passionate about supporting the arts? Think they might be interested? Share with them!</li>
<li>Be on the lookout for the book when it does become available for purchase and snag yourself a copy!</li>

Je sais aujourd'hui que si un média positif et ultra-concret comme Insane avait existé, alors que je me débattais entre les griffes de la dépression, de l'anxiété et des idées suicidaires, le combat aurait été nettement plus facile à gagner, et ma vie infiniment meilleure. Maintenant que je me trouve enfin sur le (long) chemin de la guérison, je constate aussi que j'aurais pu me trouver bien plus avancée sur cette voie aujourd'hui si j'avais su certaines choses, si on m'avait donné certains conseils, et si j'avais eu connaissance de certains produits et services.</p><p>Je suis désormais une jeune entrepreneure, avec en poche un Master Sciences Po Droits de l'Homme et Action Humanitaire. Ayant été élevée à la fois dans la culture syrienne et française, la diversité (culturelle comme sociale) me tient à coeur dans la vision que j'ai pour Insane.</p><p><strong>Je souhaite simplement que toutes les personnes en difficulté psychologique, ainsi que leurs proches, aient accès à ces informations et conseils qui ont été pour moi si déterminants. Qu'elles aillent mieux. Qu'elles reprennent espoir. Qu'elles sachent enfin quoi faire pour que leur vie vaille à nouveau la peine d'être vécue.</strong></p><p>Voilà ce que vous accomplirez en soutenant cette campagne : <strong>vous ferez littéralement la différence entre la vie et la mort. </strong>Et troubles mentaux ou pas, Insane vous offrira les clés pour une vie quotidienne plus belle, en prenant soin de votre santé mentale. <strong>Tout ça, pour un abonnement au tarif que VOUS choisissez ! </strong></p><h3>Ce dont Insane a besoin</h3><p><strong>Pour son lancement, Insane a besoin de 8500€</strong>. Cela couvrira : </p><ul>
<li>environ 500€ de frais pour récupérer les fonds gagnés grâce à cette campagne</li>
<li>environ 4000€ en contreparties</li>
<li>200€ nécessaires au dépôt de la marque</li>
<li>2 mois de fonctionnement au cas où Insane n'aurait pas assez de fonds au début ou en cas de mois difficile, ce qui couvre : </li>
</ul><p>- l'assurance professionnelle</p><p>- la location du serveur et du nom de domaine</p><p>- des Google Ads pour qu'Insane puisse se faire connaître</p><p>- les services bancaires</p><p>- les charges sociales qui m'incombent en tant que cheffe d'entreprise</p><p>- la possibilité de régler votre abonnement par carte de crédit ainsi que par PayPal</p><p>- les frais d'entrée à des conférences et salons professionnels, ainsi que les voyages nécessaires pour y assister</p><p>- 500€ pour aider à payer mon loyer et la nourriture pour chats (pour référence, le salaire minimum légal en France est de 1200€/mois)</p><h3>Les fonctionnalités Insane</h3><p>Sur Insane, vous trouverez :</p><ul>
<li>Une <strong>carte régulièrement mise à jour géolocalisant des thérapeutes</strong> (psychiatres mais aussi psychologues, sophrologues, etc.), avec de nombreuses options de filtre pour trouver facilement le profil qui vous correspondra (genre, spécialisation, tarifs secteur 1 ou 2, LGBTQ-friendly...), qui sera alimentée de façon collaborative</li>
<li>Une <strong>liste de structures</strong> (privées, publiques, associatives...) susceptibles de vous être utiles, également avec un système de filtre précis</li>
<li>Un <strong>espace abonné·e</strong> pour gérer votre abonnement, votre inscription à la newsletter, et pour modifier vos informations de profil</li>
<li>Un espace pour <strong>commenter</strong> les articles et débattre</li>
<li>Un système très performant de <strong>recherche d'articles</strong> par mots-clé</li>
<li>Un système de<strong> rubriques </strong>pour aller directement lire ce qui vous intéresse </li>
<li>Des <strong>sommaires</strong> en début de certains articles pour une lecture encore plus fructueuse et concentrée</li>
<li>Une <strong>navigation entre les langues disponibles</strong> fluide et facile</li>
</ul><h3>Ce que vous gagnez</h3><p>Les contreparties que <strong>vous</strong> gagnez avec cette campagne sont carrément cool : choisir des sujets d'articles, des goodies ~de fou~, votre nom et votre histoire affichés sur le site, un certain nombre de mois d'abonnements gratuits... Découvrez tout cela plus en détail dans la section Contreparties !</p><p><strong>Si Insane ne parvient pas à réunir la somme mentionnée</strong>, vous recevrez tout de même vos contreparties. Mais Insane ne pourra pas se lancer. Vous serez donc abonné-e à Insane pendant le temps qu'il survivra. Mais il faut être réaliste : sans argent, il sera impossible d'embaucher des rédacteurs-trices, ou de financer de la publicité sur Google pour se faire connaître, ce qui signifie un manque à gagner en termes d'abonnements, et donc à terme un média qui ne pourra plus tenir.</p><p>Si Insane récolte plus que la somme demandée (ce serait génial !), l'excédent permettra de recruter des rédacteurs-trices freelance pour écrire plus de supers articles, et ira au budget communication/marketing pour que plus de gens puissent découvrir Insane et bénéficier de ses contenus.</p><h3>Votre impact</h3><p>Bien sûr, <strong>chaque centime de votre contribution compte</strong> : cela servira au lancement d'Insane, au maintien de son système d'abonnement à tarif libre afin de ne laisser personne sur le bord de la route, tout en permettant au magazine de faire face aux inévitables moments difficiles que traverse toute entreprise.</p><p>Mais votre contribution servira surtout à ceci : parfois, une seule idée, élaborée dans un seul article, suffit à faire pencher la balance dans le bon sens pour quelqu'un qui se trouve en difficulté. <strong>Il ne dépend que de vous que cet article puisse être rédigé et disponible sur Insane.</strong> Et vous pourriez être ce quelqu'un. Faites-le pour vous, faites-le pour quelqu'un d'autre, ou pour les deux : chaque action compte.</p><h3>Risques et Challenges</h3><p>Les challenges sont assez clairs : <strong>un abonnement à tarif libre</strong>, facile à mettre en pause, signifie une difficulté supplémentaire pour planifier financièrement et s'assurer qu'Insane pourra couvrir les dépenses du mois, avant de parvenir à la fin dudit mois. <strong>Pas de publicité d'affichage</strong> signifie que la seule autre source de revenus (en-dehors des abonnements) provient d'articles sponsorisés, qui prennent du temps à contractualiser et rédiger. La trésorerie sera donc toujours une source d'inquiétude.</p><p>Mais -- vous êtes bien placé-es pour le savoir -- aujourd'hui <strong>les gens en ont assez des modèles traditionnels de publication envahis de publicité</strong>, et ils ont plutôt envie de soutenir de plus petites initiatives comme celle-ci. Nous espérons aussi récupérer au final plus d'argent grâce à un abonnement à tarif libre au lieu d'un abonnement classique, puisque <strong>le lectorat ne se sentira pas prisonnier</strong> et s'abonnera donc a priori plus facilement. De cette façon, les abonné-es pourront aussi choisir de donner plus [qu'un tarif fixe] s'ils/elles le veulent et le peuvent. Enfin, il est prévu de <strong>rendre public le budget de dépenses du mois ainsi que sa couverture</strong>, en temps réel, pour que le lectorat puisse savoir exactement où va son argent et mieux décider du montant de son abonnement.</p><h3>Pour contribuer autrement</h3><p>Parmi vous, tout le monde ne pourra pas contribuer financièrement (même si, je le répète, chaque centime compte). Mais il est <strong>très important aussi de faire connaître cette campagne ! </strong>Parlez de cette initiative à vos proches, vos ami-es, vos collègues, votre famille : sans le savoir, <strong>vous avez probablement dans votre entourage quelqu'un en difficulté qui a grand besoin de ce média.</strong> La plateforme d'Indiegogo rend le partage très facile sur les réseaux sociaux, donc on poste, on partage, on recommande ! Et puis le bouche-à-oreille classique vaut de l'or... <strong>parlez donc d'Insane chaque fois que vous le pouvez !</strong></p><p> </p><h3><i>---- English version here ----</i></h3><h3>Insane in short</h3><p>My name is Lucie and this crowdfunding campaign almost never happened. When I was battling anxiety, depression and suicidality, a positive and practical media such as Insane would have made my fights infinitely easier to win, and my life incredibly better. Now that I've made it onto the long path to recovery, I also realize that I could have been much further along the way if I had known certain things, been given certain tips, discovered certain products and services. </p><p>Now I'm a 25-year-old female entrepreneur with a Masters' Degree in Human Rights and Humanitarian Action. Raised in both Syrian and French cultures, diversity (cultural as well as social) is close to my heart when envisioning Insane.</p><p>I just want other people who are struggling psychologically, and the loved ones who care for them, to have access to all those tips. To get better. To have hope. To actually know what to do to make their daily life worth opening their eyes again.</p><p>This is what you'll achieve by participating in this campaign: you'll literally make the difference between life and death for people. And become happier yourself, for a pay-what-you-can subscription!</p><h3>What Insane Needs</h3><p><strong>To launch Insane, 8,500€ are necessary.</strong> This will cover:</p><ul>
<li>around 500€ in fees to receive the funds of this Indiegogo campaign</li>
<li>around 4,000€ in perks</li>
<li>the 200€ fee for the trademark registration</li>
<li>2 months of functioning in case we don't make enough at first or hit a low later, which entails:</li>
</ul><p>- professional insurance</p><p>- computer server, domain name</p><p>- Google Ads so that people learn of Insane's existence</p><p>- banking services</p><p>- social costs for myself as a business owner </p><p>- allowing for subscription payment via both credit card and PayPal</p><p>- entrance fee to conferences and fairs, business trips to attend said conferences and fairs</p><p>- 500€ to help pay my rent and cat food (for reference, the minimum wage in France is 1,200€/month)</p><h3>Insane features</h3><p>On Insane, you'll find:</p><ul>
<li>A regularly-updated <strong>map to locate therapists</strong> (psychiatrists but also psychologists, sophrologists, etc.), with numerous filtering options so that you can easily find the profile best suited to your needs (gender, specialization, price range, LGBTQ-friendly...), which will be collaboratively sustained</li>
<li>A <strong>list of structures</strong> (private, public,NGOs...) that you might find useful, also with a precise filtering system</li>
<li>An <strong>account system</strong> so that you can manage your subscription to Insane and to the newsletter, as well as manage your profile information</li>
<li>A <strong>comment system</strong> on articles so that you can discuss and debate</li>
<li>A highly performing <strong>article search system</strong> based on keywords</li>
<li>
<strong>Sections</strong> so that you can directly find and read what you're interested in<strong> </strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Summaries</strong> at the beginning of some articles for an even more fruitful and focused reading experience</li>
<li>A fluid and easy experience <strong>navigating between available languages</strong>  </li>
</ul><h3>What You Get</h3><p>What <strong>you're</strong> getting here is pretty cool: choosing topics for articles, ~insane~ goodies, your name and story featured on the website, a number of subscription months for free... Find out more in the Perks section!</p><p><strong>If we don't reach our goal</strong>, you will still get your perks and the money collected will still go towards launching Insane, but on a smaller scale and possibly at a later date too: only one means of subscription payment, less content... and a jeopardization of the media since we won't be able to pay much for Google Ads, which in turn will have less people subscribe.</p><p><strong>If we (hopefully!) exceed our goal</strong>, the money will be divided between recruiting freelance writers for more great content and communication/marketing so that more people get to know Insane and benefit from its content.</p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>Of course, every cent you contribute matters since it will allow Insane to launch and then to maintain its pay-what-you-can subscription system, which ensures no one is left behind, while safely facing the inevitable lows of business life. </p><p>Sometimes even one idea, featured in one article, is enough to tip the scale for someone who's struggling: it depends on you that this article be available at all. And you could totally be that person. Do it for yourself, for others, or for both: every action matters. </p><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>The challenges here are pretty obvious: a pay-what-you-can, easy-to-put-on-hold subscription means difficulty planning ahead and difficulty evaluating whether we'll actually cover the month's expenses until said month is done.

Je sais aujourd'hui que si un média positif et ultra-concret comme Insane avait existé, alors que je me débattais entre les griffes de la dépression, de l'anxiété et des idées suicidaires, le combat aurait été nettement plus facile à gagner, et ma vie infiniment meilleure. Maintenant que je me trouve enfin sur le (long) chemin de la guérison, je constate aussi que j'aurais pu me trouver bien plus avancée sur cette voie aujourd'hui si j'avais su certaines choses, si on m'avait donné certains conseils, et si j'avais eu connaissance de certains produits et services.Je suis désormais une jeune entrepreneure, avec en poche un Master Sciences Po Droits de l'Homme et Action Humanitaire. Ayant été élevée à la fois dans la culture syrienne et française, la diversité (culturelle comme sociale) me tient à coeur dans la vision que j'ai pour Insane.Je souhaite simplement que toutes les personnes en difficulté psychologique, ainsi que leurs proches, aient accès à ces informations et conseils qui ont été pour moi si déterminants. Qu'elles aillent mieux. Qu'elles reprennent espoir. Qu'elles sachent enfin quoi faire pour que leur vie vaille à nouveau la peine d'être vécue.Voilà ce que vous accomplirez en soutenant cette campagne : vous ferez littéralement la différence entre la vie et la mort. Et troubles mentaux ou pas, Insane vous offrira les clés pour une vie quotidienne plus belle, en prenant soin de votre santé mentale. Tout ça, pour un abonnement au tarif que VOUS choisissez ! Ce dont Insane a besoinPour son lancement, Insane a besoin de 8500€. Cela couvrira : 
environ 500€ de frais pour récupérer les fonds gagnés grâce à cette campagne
environ 4000€ en contreparties
200€ nécessaires au dépôt de la marque
2 mois de fonctionnement au cas où Insane n'aurait pas assez de fonds au début ou en cas de mois difficile, ce qui couvre : 
- l'assurance professionnelle- la location du serveur et du nom de domaine- des Google Ads pour qu'Insane puisse se faire connaître- les services bancaires- les charges sociales qui m'incombent en tant que cheffe d'entreprise- la possibilité de régler votre abonnement par carte de crédit ainsi que par PayPal- les frais d'entrée à des conférences et salons professionnels, ainsi que les voyages nécessaires pour y assister- 500€ pour aider à payer mon loyer et la nourriture pour chats (pour référence, le salaire minimum légal en France est de 1200€/mois)Les fonctionnalités InsaneSur Insane, vous trouverez :
Une carte régulièrement mise à jour géolocalisant des thérapeutes (psychiatres mais aussi psychologues, sophrologues, etc.), avec de nombreuses options de filtre pour trouver facilement le profil qui vous correspondra (genre, spécialisation, tarifs secteur 1 ou 2, LGBTQ-friendly...), qui sera alimentée de façon collaborative
Une liste de structures (privées, publiques, associatives...) susceptibles de vous être utiles, également avec un système de filtre précis
Un espace abonné·e pour gérer votre abonnement, votre inscription à la newsletter, et pour modifier vos informations de profil
Un espace pour commenter les articles et débattre
Un système très performant de recherche d'articles par mots-clé
Un système de rubriques pour aller directement lire ce qui vous intéresse 
Des sommaires en début de certains articles pour une lecture encore plus fructueuse et concentrée
Une navigation entre les langues disponibles fluide et facile
Ce que vous gagnezLes contreparties que vous gagnez avec cette campagne sont carrément cool : choisir des sujets d'articles, des goodies ~de fou~, votre nom et votre histoire affichés sur le site, un certain nombre de mois d'abonnements gratuits... Découvrez tout cela plus en détail dans la section Contreparties !Si Insane ne parvient pas à réunir la somme mentionnée, vous recevrez tout de même vos contreparties. Mais Insane ne pourra pas se lancer. Vous serez donc abonné-e à Insane pendant le temps qu'il survivra. Mais il faut être réaliste : sans argent, il sera impossible d'embaucher des rédacteurs-trices, ou de financer de la publicité sur Google pour se faire connaître, ce qui signifie un manque à gagner en termes d'abonnements, et donc à terme un média qui ne pourra plus tenir.Si Insane récolte plus que la somme demandée (ce serait génial !), l'excédent permettra de recruter des rédacteurs-trices freelance pour écrire plus de supers articles, et ira au budget communication/marketing pour que plus de gens puissent découvrir Insane et bénéficier de ses contenus.Votre impactBien sûr, chaque centime de votre contribution compte : cela servira au lancement d'Insane, au maintien de son système d'abonnement à tarif libre afin de ne laisser personne sur le bord de la route, tout en permettant au magazine de faire face aux inévitables moments difficiles que traverse toute entreprise.Mais votre contribution servira surtout à ceci : parfois, une seule idée, élaborée dans un seul article, suffit à faire pencher la balance dans le bon sens pour quelqu'un qui se trouve en difficulté. Il ne dépend que de vous que cet article puisse être rédigé et disponible sur Insane. Et vous pourriez être ce quelqu'un. Faites-le pour vous, faites-le pour quelqu'un d'autre, ou pour les deux : chaque action compte.Risques et ChallengesLes challenges sont assez clairs : un abonnement à tarif libre, facile à mettre en pause, signifie une difficulté supplémentaire pour planifier financièrement et s'assurer qu'Insane pourra couvrir les dépenses du mois, avant de parvenir à la fin dudit mois. Pas de publicité d'affichage signifie que la seule autre source de revenus (en-dehors des abonnements) provient d'articles sponsorisés, qui prennent du temps à contractualiser et rédiger. La trésorerie sera donc toujours une source d'inquiétude.Mais -- vous êtes bien placé-es pour le savoir -- aujourd'hui les gens en ont assez des modèles traditionnels de publication envahis de publicité, et ils ont plutôt envie de soutenir de plus petites initiatives comme celle-ci. Nous espérons aussi récupérer au final plus d'argent grâce à un abonnement à tarif libre au lieu d'un abonnement classique, puisque le lectorat ne se sentira pas prisonnier et s'abonnera donc a priori plus facilement. De cette façon, les abonné-es pourront aussi choisir de donner plus [qu'un tarif fixe] s'ils/elles le veulent et le peuvent. Enfin, il est prévu de rendre public le budget de dépenses du mois ainsi que sa couverture, en temps réel, pour que le lectorat puisse savoir exactement où va son argent et mieux décider du montant de son abonnement.Pour contribuer autrementParmi vous, tout le monde ne pourra pas contribuer financièrement (même si, je le répète, chaque centime compte). Mais il est très important aussi de faire connaître cette campagne ! Parlez de cette initiative à vos proches, vos ami-es, vos collègues, votre famille : sans le savoir, vous avez probablement dans votre entourage quelqu'un en difficulté qui a grand besoin de ce média. La plateforme d'Indiegogo rend le partage très facile sur les réseaux sociaux, donc on poste, on partage, on recommande ! Et puis le bouche-à-oreille classique vaut de l'or... parlez donc d'Insane chaque fois que vous le pouvez ! ---- English version here ----Insane in shortMy name is Lucie and this crowdfunding campaign almost never happened. When I was battling anxiety, depression and suicidality, a positive and practical media such as Insane would have made my fights infinitely easier to win, and my life incredibly better. Now that I've made it onto the long path to recovery, I also realize that I could have been much further along the way if I had known certain things, been given certain tips, discovered certain products and services. Now I'm a 25-year-old female entrepreneur with a Masters' Degree in Human Rights and Humanitarian Action. Raised in both Syrian and French cultures, diversity (cultural as well as social) is close to my heart when envisioning Insane.I just want other people who are struggling psychologically, and the loved ones who care for them, to have access to all those tips. To get better. To have hope. To actually know what to do to make their daily life worth opening their eyes again.This is what you'll achieve by participating in this campaign: you'll literally make the difference between life and death for people. And become happier yourself, for a pay-what-you-can subscription!What Insane NeedsTo launch Insane, 8,500€ are necessary. This will cover:
around 500€ in fees to receive the funds of this Indiegogo campaign
around 4,000€ in perks
the 200€ fee for the trademark registration
2 months of functioning in case we don't make enough at first or hit a low later, which entails:
- professional insurance- computer server, domain name- Google Ads so that people learn of Insane's existence- banking services- social costs for myself as a business owner - allowing for subscription payment via both credit card and PayPal- entrance fee to conferences and fairs, business trips to attend said conferences and fairs- 500€ to help pay my rent and cat food (for reference, the minimum wage in France is 1,200€/month)Insane featuresOn Insane, you'll find:
A regularly-updated map to locate therapists (psychiatrists but also psychologists, sophrologists, etc.), with numerous filtering options so that you can easily find the profile best suited to your needs (gender, specialization, price range, LGBTQ-friendly...), which will be collaboratively sustained
A list of structures (private, public,NGOs...) that you might find useful, also with a precise filtering system
An account system so that you can manage your subscription to Insane and to the newsletter, as well as manage your profile information
A comment system on articles so that you can discuss and debate
A highly performing article search system based on keywords

Sections so that you can directly find and read what you're interested in 


Summaries at the beginning of some articles for an even more fruitful and focused reading experience
A fluid and easy experience navigating between available languages  
What You GetWhat you're getting here is pretty cool: choosing topics for articles, ~insane~ goodies, your name and story featured on the website, a number of subscription months for free... Find out more in the Perks section!If we don't reach our goal, you will still get your perks and the money collected will still go towards launching Insane, but on a smaller scale and possibly at a later date too: only one means of subscription payment, less content... and a jeopardization of the media since we won't be able to pay much for Google Ads, which in turn will have less people subscribe.If we (hopefully!) exceed our goal, the money will be divided between recruiting freelance writers for more great content and communication/marketing so that more people get to know Insane and benefit from its content.The ImpactOf course, every cent you contribute matters since it will allow Insane to launch and then to maintain its pay-what-you-can subscription system, which ensures no one is left behind, while safely facing the inevitable lows of business life. Sometimes even one idea, featured in one article, is enough to tip the scale for someone who's struggling: it depends on you that this article be available at all. And you could totally be that person. Do it for yourself, for others, or for both: every action matters. Risks & ChallengesThe challenges here are pretty obvious: a pay-what-you-can, easy-to-put-on-hold subscription means difficulty planning ahead and difficulty evaluating whether we'll actually cover the month's expenses until said month is done. No display ads means the only other source of revenue we'll have is from sponsored articles, which take a long time to secure and achieve. So treasury will be a constant source of worry.But people are now fed up with traditional ad-stocked publications and they tend to want to support small initiatives like this one. Also, we hope to actually get more from a pay-what-you-can subscription than from a classic one, since readers won't feel trapped and so may subscribe more easily. This way, they will also be able to give more [than a fixed price] if they can and wish to. Finally, we are planning to make public the month's expenses coverage in real time so that readers can see exactly where their money goes and get a better idea of how much to pay for their subscription.Other Ways You Can HelpSome of you won't be able to contribute financially at all (although, again, every cent matters).

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Hello there, I'm the person behind Milk the Cow podcast. A platform for discussion and issue-based work in both audio and written formats. Across social media, there are circa 80,000 people who kindly follow my work.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I feel now more than ever that a book as an educational resource on the true history of British colonialism (and it's contemporary impact) is needed. What is colonialism and its intersections and impacts in our society? How has and will the Black Lives Matter movement change our world? Who is the real Winston Churchill? How does football act as a vehicle for the left and right-wing of politics, of prejudice, and solidarity? What are the potential solutions to all of this and how can we bring people together? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a white man, I feel compelled to use my voice, privilege, and platform to make a contribution to positive change by amplifying BAME voices, who will be centered in this work. I would like to thank my BAME friends both on and offline for encouraging me to put this project together. I am also a product of colonialism, my ancestry is Irish, so an element of this project is intensely personal and I hope revelatory as I confront myself and maybe my own prejudices via this process of shared discovery.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>On a personal note, I have a chance that may not present itself again in my life. To make a transition from part-time amateur to full time professional. The book is a culmination of over 10 years of writing published via the ever-growing Milk the Cow community - all available for free.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If my work has ever impacted you in a positive way, why not invest in me via a one-off contribution? </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What do I want to do with the money?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As well as supporting the production of the book, I want to use this experience as a catalyst for wider professional development.  By the end of this year, I want it to be very apparent to you good people just how far your kindness has impacted my ability to produce much more professional looking content.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The initial £5000 will go towards living costs between June 2020 and March 2021. This amount will mean my rent and some bills are covered and that stress levels at home are manageable. This will enable me to live frugally but focus fully on producing the book without any anxiety.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Any stretch targets that occur will go towards:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>A new website to host all of my content.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Better camera equipment, editing software, and microphones enabling me to share the interviews with people on this journey as video podcasts. I have only produced audio to date.</p>

<h2>Now shipping in HARDCOVER, not paperback!</h2>
<p>After getting a better idea of my publishing options I discovered that it was possible to get hardcover books printed at a reasonable price, so that is exactly what I'm doing.  I want to make sure that I'm giving you, my backers, the highest-quality product possible for your money.  I can't change the perk descriptions, but any purchase of a ""paperback novel"" during this campaign will get you a hardcover book instead.  I will also be sending out an epub file along with the PDFs to allow for more electronic reading options.  Thanks for your interest!</p>
<h2>A gripping debut novel from a serving soldier!</h2>
<p>THE MAIDEN'S WAR is an epic war novel informed by my years of service in the United States Army.  Set in an industrializing fantasy world where magic has almost, but not entirely died out, it tells the story of the latest campaign of the Thousand Years' War of the Empire of Masks against the Western Kingdom - a war that, not too long ago, the Kingdom seemed to have won.  Rising like a phoenix after decades of brutal insurgency broke the Royal occupation, the Empire is more powerful than ever and hell-bent on vengeance.</p>
<p>Now the Imperial Army has stormed across the Night River, destroying the Kingdom's mightiest fortress in a matter of hours and opening the door for a massive invasion.  The Royal Army mobilizes for a counteroffensive, but can they possibly succeed?</p>

<h3>Our Heroes</h3>
<p>Sophia Rose is a young soldier in Charlie Company, 2nd Battalion of the Royal Army's 24th Infantry Regiment, a reserve unit from the idyllic town Jade Falls.  Most women in the Royal Army serve in support roles, or in the case of noble young ladies with a wild streak, in the light cavalry.  It's almost unheard-of to see a girl in the infantry, but in the reserves, when your father's the First Sergeant, well... there's actually nothing in the regulations <i>against</i> it.  She joined the Army to spend time with her father and her friends, and she'll be marching with them into the inferno of war.</p>
<p>Arilin Wehrherz is a princess, second in line to the Kingdom's throne.  After saying goodbye to her beloved older brother as he departed for the front with his regiment she asks her father to let her accompany the Army herself despite her young age.  She'll need to learn about war to properly fulfill her duties as a princess, after all.  Her father agreed on the conditions that she'd find a capable chaperone and stay well out of any danger, and he probably didn't expect her to go out and do exactly that.  War is full of surprises, though, and her little adventure might turn out to be a lot more dangerous - and important - than she bargained for.</p>
<p>Patricia MacMahon is the first female two-star general in the Royal Army's history (and one of the youngest), and her career is <i>dead</i>.  Stuck pushing paper at headquarters after being promoted out of responsibility, she seizes on Princess Arilin's crazy request as a way to maybe, somehow, revitalize her career.  At a minimum it'll be a lot more entertaining than sitting around the half-empty War Ministry.  She doesn't have a ready ticket to the front herself, but she has someone in mind that should fit their needs quite nicely.</p>
<p>Walter Haas has been a general for longer than Patricia has been an <i>officer</i>, and he's been fighting the Empire since before she was <i>born</i>.  Commander of the Royal Army's IX Corps, he was staring mandatory retirement in the face when the Empire attacked and threw him into one last war.  IX Corps will be far to the rear as the Royal Army's counterattack begins, an ideal place for a young princess to learn about war without being exposed to any real danger, and he's not against having a couple of pretty girls around headquarters to improve the atmosphere.  Patricia's far from the worst officer he knows, either, and the Empire doesn't fight by half measures.  He might need all the help he can get.</p>
<p>June Anjanou, the ""long-haired dragoon"", is the son of the Imperial Western Area Army's supreme commander and the heir to a legacy as a Black Knight that goes back to the days of the Faceless King.  The only thing more dangerous than his sword are the soldiers under his command as he rides out with the Imperial cavalry to meet the Kingdom's counterattack.</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>I am a nine-year veteran of the United States Army.  As an officer in the Field Artillery, I have served across the world, from Hawaii to Korea to Texas to Iraq to the Airborne here at Fort Bragg, North Carolina.  I led a self-propelled cannon platoon on the front line of democracy in Korea and commanded one of the companies making up the 1st Armored Division's headquarters, the two greatest honors of my life.  I am a veteran of the war against ISIS, a struggle which I firmly believe should be called the War of the False Caliph but which is properly known to the Army as Operation Inherent Resolve.</p>
<p>I dreamed up, outlined and finally wrote this book across all of that.  My test readers couldn't put it down, and one of them, a truly well-read man, made some comparisons with classics of literature that floored me.  Armed with dreams of literary success, I put together my query letter and flooded out requests to agents to represent me and get my work published.  My manuscript was <i>excellent</i> and as a servicemember who wrote it on active duty I thought I had a compelling story that would have literary agents fighting each other to be my voice in the industry.  You would think that a war novel full of dynamic and compelling female protagonists, written by an Army officer who has worked by, with and for women in the military, would be an ideal product to put on shelves in this day and age.</p>
<p>Apparently not.  My project was met with out-of-hand rejection from agents, or the silence of those who don't bother to reply to rejected queries.  Perhaps the story of a dutiful princess admiring her older brother and struggling to shoulder her responsibilities, or of a girl joining the Army to spend time - and fight - alongside her strong and loving father and her male friends, offended their sensibilities somehow and scared them off.</p>
<p>No matter.  I wrote this book to appeal to <i>everyone </i>- liberal and conservative, young and old, from grizzled veterans to complete civilians.  My rule when writing was ""Twilight to Tom Clancy"".  And after watching the success of other creators crowdfunding their projects I decided to take the chance (the staff officer in me would call it a <i>calculated risk</i>) and dive in myself.</p>

After getting a better idea of my publishing options I discovered that it was possible to get hardcover books printed at a reasonable price, so that is exactly what I'm doing.  I want to make sure that I'm giving you, my backers, the highest-quality product possible for your money.  I can't change the perk descriptions, but any purchase of a ""paperback novel"" during this campaign will get you a hardcover book instead.  I will also be sending out an epub file along with the PDFs to allow for more electronic reading options.  Thanks for your interest!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The End of Echoes is the book of my heart. It is the first novel I wrote because it tells a story I believe needs to be in the world. It takes the reader deep into the character's lives to allow them to walk alongside them in their tragedy and healing. It touches on many important subjects that impact people's lives such as domestic violence, mental health issues and alcoholism/addiction.</p>
<p>It also shows the importance of legacies we leave behind for our children as well as how the same event can impact people in such different ways.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Two families are forever linked by tragedy.</strong></p>
<p>Ruby Dunkin is in an abusive marriage. Despite her efforts to protect her two sons, her husband’s cruelty knows no bounds and eventually everyone suffers at his hand. Their volatile situation ends in tragedy. Billy, Ruby’s eldest son, is torn away from everyone that he loves. His loss leaves him consumed by hatred, rage and self-loathing. He becomes the one person he hates most in this world—his father.</p>
<p>Chelsea Wyatt is a senior in high school when she goes missing after work one night, never to return home. Until that time, her parents, Tom and Kendra Wyatt, knew only of this type of loss from stories on the evening news. Crimes like this are unheard of in their quiet and safe Midwestern town. Her parents, brother and friends all try to make sense of the tragedy that now consumes their lives, forever altering their futures.</p>
<p>For over eighteen years, no one knows the connection between Ruby Dunkin and Chelsea Wyatt. A journey through time reveals the common thread stitching their heartbreak together. Yesterday echoes throughout each character's life as they decide how, and If, they will break the chains of the past.</p>
<p><strong>Will they continue to leave a legacy of pain and loss for future generations? Will they break the cycles of abuse that have destroyed so many lives?</strong></p>

<h3>Book Summary</h3>
<p>As full time travellers, my partner Chris and I headed off to Morocco in January of 2020, and expected this trip to be like many others.  We looked forward to riding camels in the desert, exploring the nooks and crannies of the country, and learning all that we could about the Moroccan culture in the 90 day visa period that we were given. However, our blissful travels soon turned into some sort of crazy apocalyptic nightmare as suddenly borders, highways, restaurants and shops closed down all around us.  We hadn't really been paying attention to the news, and well, to say that I was side swiped by fear would be a huge understatement.  </p>
<p>What the hell was going on?  </p>
<p>When news reached me of the borders to Canada closing as well, I knew that something really serious was happening.  Never in my 30 years of travelling had I seen anything like THIS happen.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611942658/i0fdbxkiva9kgfqcdsof.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Soon my friends were sending me all sorts of conspiracy theories, including one that the internet may shut down.  Being so far away from my family, with no current hope of returning to Canada, I fell into the deepest pit of fear that I had ever known.  I was a foreigner in a foreign land and I had no idea if this country was equipped to deal with a disaster of this magnitude.  </p>
<p>Would there be enough food to feed everybody?  Would the Moroccan people take care of us? Or would they cast us aside like the foreigners that we were?  Would we really be able to ride this out here?  Is it safe to be in a country like this during a global emergency?  </p>
<p>The questions came fast and furious as I spun myself into a vortex of continual fear.  However, over time, the Moroccan people, without even trying, were able to teach me how to deal with my fear.  Primarily, they demonstrated how it is to live in the now, and they exhibited kindness and hospitality like I had never known before.  Through all of this, I was finally able to submit my controlling nature, and allow myself to be taken care of.  Moroccans are famous for their hospitality, and me and my partner got a first hand show to see just how legitimate this claim is. </p>
<p>This book is a fully transparent tale that explores what my thoughts and emotions were like as we navigated this new crazy reality.  It is a travel story, a memoir, and possibly a self-help guide as I know that many people will find bits and pieces of my story that they will relate to.  </p>

<h3>Reasons For Funding </h3>
<p>I am over halfway finished writing this book, and am looking for funding for the following reasons: </p>
<p>#1. As full time travellers, it is sometimes difficult to find a place where we can stay in one place to complete large scale projects.  For something like this, it is imperative to be able to hunker down in one spot where I can focus completely on my writing.  Funds raised will help us to rent an apartment for a longer term to do this.</p>
<p>#2. Although I have submitted to publishers, I may not get a publishing contract.  These funds will ensure that I am able to self-publish if the need arises.  </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Story Behind the Book</strong></h3>
<p>One day on our way to church, my then 7-year-old daughter, Kyah, asked me, “Does God think boys are more important than girls, because all we ever learn about in church are boys?”</p>
<p>Her question ran through my head and my heart for several days. I could not shake the feeling that there was something I was supposed to do to answer her question. I began to search for books about women in the Bible, but I primarily found books related to princesses or that featured primarily Caucasian images. It was important to me to ensure these women of the Bible were portrayed accurately as female heroes, not as princesses, and that girls of all ethnicities would see themselves in the images.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, I began to teach Kyah stories from the Bible about girls who trusted God and did amazing things in their lives because of their faith. We called them SHEroes (girls who are heroes). I initially self-published the Old Testament edition and sold more than 1,000 copies on my own. My NEW book, which now includes Old and New Testament SHEroes, was recently picked up by Morgan James Publishing and will be shared with children around the world!</p>
<p>It is imperative that every child knows that God uses all people – boys, girls, men, and women of all ethnicities – to demonstrate His power and love here on earth – not just in history, but today!</p>
<p><strong>We want to partner with YOU</strong> <strong>to get SHEroes of the Bible into households, churches and organizations around the world!</strong> You can change the trajectory of a child's life by sharing the powerful stories of these courageous, faith-filled women! SHEroes of the Bible is needed in every household, church and discipleship program across the globe. Through this book, young and old will be inspired to become the dynamic, strong leaders that God created them to be. With your help, we can shape a future generation.</p>

<h3 align=""center""><strong>What Makes This Book Unique?</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i><u>This book is filled with heroic WOMEN from the Bible!</u></i></strong></p>
<p>Many people have never heard of these dynamic world-changing SHEroes. The Bible is clear that God can make a hero out of anyone that chooses to trust God and push past their fear, no matter the cost. In this book, every woman portrayed is unique and demonstrates heroism differently. Some are warriors on a battlefield while others demonstrate fearless faith, sacrificial love and limitless compassion.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i><u>Each SHEro is ethnically and beautifully DIVERSE!</u></i></strong> </p>
<p>Ethnic diversity is lacking in many children's books, but it is so important that all children see their beautiful selves represented in a positive light. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u><i>Each story includes</i><i><i> </i>engaging and EMPOWERING discussion questions!</i></u></strong></p>
<p>Through each discussion question, children are encouraged to not only engage in self-reflection but to act! SHEroes of the Bible challenges kids to personally engage with their family, friends and community by putting their faith into action.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What is Included in This Book?</strong></h3>
<p>This brilliantly illustrated children’s PAPERBACK book is approximately 140 pages and <strong>contains 20 stories of 26 women</strong> from the Bible who became SHEroes when they trusted God and were moved to action. As its name portrays, “SHEroes of the Bible” provides strong female role models who are relevant to past, present and future generations. Girls of all ages will be inspired to become the dynamic, strong women that God created them to be.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>~ Devotion Questions ~</strong></i></h3>
<p>Each story includes 3 to 4 discussion questions. These questions will help children personally apply what they have learned so that their faith becomes their own personal experience. Through each discussion question, children are encouraged to not only engage in self-reflection but to act! SHEroes of the Bible challenges kids to personally engage with their family, friends and community by putting their faith into action.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>SHEroes of Exodus, Chapter 1</i></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>“…But because the midwives feared God, they refused to obey the King’s orders…” </i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>                                                                                                      Exodus 1:17 (NLT)</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>“It’s a boy!” shouted Shiphrah to her friend, Puah, and to the baby’s mother. A precious new baby had just been born into the world! Shiphrah and Puah loved their jobs as midwives—helping babies be born safely and then taking care of the new mothers.</p>
<p>The baby’s parents smiled at each other with happiness, but they exchanged worried looks, too. They were both excited and afraid at the same time.</p>
<p>The new parents, and the midwives, Shiphrah and Puah, were Hebrews. They lived in Egypt, the land of the pyramids. Although Egypt was not their home, the king of Egypt—called “Pharaoh,” liked the Hebrews so much that he gave them his best land to build their villages.</p>
<p>While they were living in Egypt, God blessed the Hebrews with so many children that it was hard to count them all. Each family had babies and then those babies grew up and had more babies. Before you knew it, the Hebrews were more numerous than the Egyptians!</p>
<p>During this time, the Pharaoh who had loved the Hebrew people died, and a new Pharaoh came into power. This new ruler became afraid that the Hebrews were growing too quickly in strength and numbers, and he thought to himself, “What if they take over Egypt? I have to make sure that doesn’t happen!”</p>
<p>So, Pharaoh made the Hebrews his slaves, in order that they wouldn’t get too powerful for the Egyptians. He made the Hebrews work hard day and night in the hot desert sun without being paid. They were forced to build the Egyptians’ homes and kingdom. They had to make bricks out of the clay that covered the ground, and their taskmasters beat them if they didn’t make enough. To make things worse, the Egyptians forced the Hebrew slaves to deliver the bricks on heavy carts that they had to push by hand. Doesn’t that sound terrible?</p>
<p>Even though life was very hard for the Israelites, God continued to bless them with more and more children. The more they suffered, the more babies they had!</p>
<p>When it was time for the Hebrew mothers to give birth to their babies, they would call for special nurses called “midwives, “who would come to their homes and help them. Shiphrah and Puah were the two lead nurses who oversaw all the other nurses in Egypt. They had a big job; they made sure that all the babies born were delivered healthy.</p>
<p>The Pharaoh continued to be fearful of how many Hebrew boys were being born. He wasn’t worried about the girls, just the boys, because he thought the boys would grow up and form an army to fight against him. So he made a plan to get rid of all the Hebrew boy babies as soon as they were born. He called Shiphrah and Puah to his palace and commanded them, “Every time you help a Hebrew woman have a baby, if it’s a boy, kill him, but if it’s a girl, let her live. That way we can stop the Hebrews from taking over Egypt.”</p>
<p>Shiphrah and Puah feared if they didn’t do what the Pharaoh told them, he might kill them. But they loved God more than they feared the Pharaoh. Shiphrah and Puah knew that something must be done to stop this horrible order from taking place, and they knew that as the lead midwives, they were the only ones who could do anything about it. Shiphrah and Puah were about to follow God’s plan and become SHEroes!</p>
<p>Shiphrah and Puah were in charge of many other midwives, so they gathered all who they knew loved God and told them the Pharaoh’s terrible plan. All the women bravely agreed to save the Hebrew boy babies from being killed. They knew that every time they saved a baby boy, they were risking their own lives, but they couldn’t stand by while innocent children were hurt!</p>
<p>This was their plan: each time a Hebrew woman gave birth to a baby, the nurses made sure to do all they could to help her deliver a healthy child—boy or girl. The mothers of the babies then risked punishment or even death by bravely hiding the baby boys from the Egyptians.</p>
<p>After a while, the Pharaoh ordered Shiphrah and Puah to come and see him at his palace. “Why are there still Hebrew boys being born?” he thundered.</p>
<p>They stood frozen in fear. Cleverly, they told him, “The Hebrew women are so strong that the babies are already born before we get there!” And the Pharaoh believed them.</p>
<p>Shiphrah and Puah, and many midwives and mothers, made the choice to trust God in spite of their fear of the Pharaoh. They saved countless lives, including a boy named Moses. God had an amazing plan to one day use Moses to rescue His people, the Hebrews, from slavery in Egypt and bring them to a beautiful new land – a land where they were free. Moses would lead the way for the greatest rescuer the world has ever known—Jesus!</p>

</div></div>","Story Behind the Book
One day on our way to church, my then 7-year-old daughter, Kyah, asked me, “Does God think boys are more important than girls, because all we ever learn about in church are boys?”
Her question ran through my head and my heart for several days. I could not shake the feeling that there was something I was supposed to do to answer her question. I began to search for books about women in the Bible, but I primarily found books related to princesses or that featured primarily Caucasian images. It was important to me to ensure these women of the Bible were portrayed accurately as female heroes, not as princesses, and that girls of all ethnicities would see themselves in the images.
Over the next few weeks, I began to teach Kyah stories from the Bible about girls who trusted God and did amazing things in their lives because of their faith. We called them SHEroes (girls who are heroes). I initially self-published the Old Testament edition and sold more than 1,000 copies on my own. My NEW book, which now includes Old and New Testament SHEroes, was recently picked up by Morgan James Publishing and will be shared with children around the world!
It is imperative that every child knows that God uses all people – boys, girls, men, and women of all ethnicities – to demonstrate His power and love here on earth – not just in history, but today!
We want to partner with YOU to get SHEroes of the Bible into households, churches and organizations around the world! You can change the trajectory of a child's life by sharing the powerful stories of these courageous, faith-filled women! SHEroes of the Bible is needed in every household, church and discipleship program across the globe. Through this book, young and old will be inspired to become the dynamic, strong leaders that God created them to be. With your help, we can shape a future generation.
We have many perk options that include book donations to nonprofits who are changing lives around the globe! Make sure to check out these incredible organizations further down on my campaign page.

Sample Story:
Shiphrah and Puah

 
SHEroes of Exodus, Chapter 1
“…But because the midwives feared God, they refused to obey the King’s orders…” 
                                                                                                      Exodus 1:17 (NLT)
 
“It’s a boy!” shouted Shiphrah to her friend, Puah, and to the baby’s mother. A precious new baby had just been born into the world! Shiphrah and Puah loved their jobs as midwives—helping babies be born safely and then taking care of the new mothers.
The baby’s parents smiled at each other with happiness, but they exchanged worried looks, too. They were both excited and afraid at the same time.
The new parents, and the midwives, Shiphrah and Puah, were Hebrews. They lived in Egypt, the land of the pyramids. Although Egypt was not their home, the king of Egypt—called “Pharaoh,” liked the Hebrews so much that he gave them his best land to build their villages.
While they were living in Egypt, God blessed the Hebrews with so many children that it was hard to count them all. Each family had babies and then those babies grew up and had more babies. Before you knew it, the Hebrews were more numerous than the Egyptians!
During this time, the Pharaoh who had loved the Hebrew people died, and a new Pharaoh came into power. This new ruler became afraid that the Hebrews were growing too quickly in strength and numbers, and he thought to himself, “What if they take over Egypt? I have to make sure that doesn’t happen!”
So, Pharaoh made the Hebrews his slaves, in order that they wouldn’t get too powerful for the Egyptians. He made the Hebrews work hard day and night in the hot desert sun without being paid. They were forced to build the Egyptians’ homes and kingdom. They had to make bricks out of the clay that covered the ground, and their taskmasters beat them if they didn’t make enough. To make things worse, the Egyptians forced the Hebrew slaves to deliver the bricks on heavy carts that they had to push by hand. Doesn’t that sound terrible?
Even though life was very hard for the Israelites, God continued to bless them with more and more children. The more they suffered, the more babies they had!
When it was time for the Hebrew mothers to give birth to their babies, they would call for special nurses called “midwives, “who would come to their homes and help them. Shiphrah and Puah were the two lead nurses who oversaw all the other nurses in Egypt. They had a big job; they made sure that all the babies born were delivered healthy.
The Pharaoh continued to be fearful of how many Hebrew boys were being born. He wasn’t worried about the girls, just the boys, because he thought the boys would grow up and form an army to fight against him. So he made a plan to get rid of all the Hebrew boy babies as soon as they were born. He called Shiphrah and Puah to his palace and commanded them, “Every time you help a Hebrew woman have a baby, if it’s a boy, kill him, but if it’s a girl, let her live. That way we can stop the Hebrews from taking over Egypt.”
Shiphrah and Puah feared if they didn’t do what the Pharaoh told them, he might kill them. But they loved God more than they feared the Pharaoh. Shiphrah and Puah knew that something must be done to stop this horrible order from taking place, and they knew that as the lead midwives, they were the only ones who could do anything about it. Shiphrah and Puah were about to follow God’s plan and become SHEroes!
Shiphrah and Puah were in charge of many other midwives, so they gathered all who they knew loved God and told them the Pharaoh’s terrible plan. All the women bravely agreed to save the Hebrew boy babies from being killed. They knew that every time they saved a baby boy, they were risking their own lives, but they couldn’t stand by while innocent children were hurt!
This was their plan: each time a Hebrew woman gave birth to a baby, the nurses made sure to do all they could to help her deliver a healthy child—boy or girl. The mothers of the babies then risked punishment or even death by bravely hiding the baby boys from the Egyptians.
After a while, the Pharaoh ordered Shiphrah and Puah to come and see him at his palace. “Why are there still Hebrew boys being born?” he thundered.
They stood frozen in fear. Cleverly, they told him, “The Hebrew women are so strong that the babies are already born before we get there!” And the Pharaoh believed them.
Shiphrah and Puah, and many midwives and mothers, made the choice to trust God in spite of their fear of the Pharaoh. They saved countless lives, including a boy named Moses. God had an amazing plan to one day use Moses to rescue His people, the Hebrews, from slavery in Egypt and bring them to a beautiful new land – a land where they were free. Moses would lead the way for the greatest rescuer the world has ever known—Jesus!
Devotion:


Shiphrah and Puah feared Pharaoh and his army, but they trusted God despite their fears. What are some things you are afraid of? ​

<p>Mr. Lewis’s teacher, Hazrat Inayat Khan, published 12 volumes of Sufi teachings in the 1960s, which Mansur combed for Sufi stories. He compiled and edited over 400 Sufi tales, published as <i>Big Tales: All the stories in the 12 volumes of The Sufi Message of Hazrat Inayat Khan</i>, The Einstein Academy, Tucson, AZ 2015.</p>
<p>After Mr. Lewis' death in 1971, Mansur started a Sufi Center in Boston, MA, and supported himself by installing auto glass, as well as traveling and teaching Sufism at weekend workshops and seminars. In 1980, Mansur moved to Tucson and found work in the film industry when Hollywood came to Arizona by working in 44 feature films and TV movies as a Grip. He found employment on such big Hollywood local films as Tombstone, Maverick, and The Quick and the Dead.</p>
<p>A member of IATSE, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Mansur transitioned from film to work as a stage carpenter at the University of Arizona’s Centennial Hall for Broadway in Tucson, as well as a Trade Show professional, setting up such events as the Gem &amp; Mineral Show in Tucson.</p>
<p>In 2017 The Einstein Academy published <i>Don’t Search, Celebrate! The Collected poems of Mansur Johnson</i>. Since then, Mansur began work on <i>In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great, The 1998 Footsteps of Alexander the Great Tour, Part 1.</i></p>

<p>V.  Overview of In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great</p>
<p>                                                                 INTRODUCTION TO PART 1</p>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">            I am grateful to Michael Wood for coming out with a book and TV special called <i>In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great</i> while I was preparing for our trip In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">            I followed Mr. Wood’s maps, noted his omissions, and expanded his narrow focus. I renamed our trip <strong>The 1998 Footsteps of Alexander the Great Tour.</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">            Why read this book when Michael Wood wrote the book and made the TV show already?</p>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">            First, let me say, Michael Wood followed the steps of Alexander to most of the places we visit. Unlike us, he gives the reader Alexander’s great career, his battles and victories, and anecdotes and contradictions from sources, meaning the ancient writers, Arrian, Quintus Curtius, Diodorus of Sicily, and Plutarch, plus Strabo and Pliny, Greek geographers, geographer being another way to characterize one who wrote a descriptive history of people and places from different regions of the world known to his era.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">            We followed—I say “we” because my companion was my girl friend from Switzerland, Marianne—the steps of Alexander and learned, like Alexander, what these parts of the world are like, what the land feels like. Like Alexander, we lingered at beautiful places.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">            For example, Wood never mentions Phaeselis on the south coast of Turkey. Alexander spent the winter of 334 B.C. in this beautiful place, thus concluding his first year of conquest. We got off track for three days in equally beautiful, neighboring Olympos (Chapter 9), which unlike Phaeselis, was one of Lycia’s six major cities with a vote of 3 each in the Lycian league.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">            We sought to learn, like Alexander, the history. History after Alexander, like Roman monuments, was of incidental interest to us. Sometimes the Romans’ utilization of an earlier Alexander site, such as Ephesus (Chapter 5), required that we look at stuff less than 2,000 years old.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">           Of particular interest to me was Alexander’s interest in dreams, visions, and prophecy. The Didyma Temple (Chapter 6) and Siwa Oasis (Chapter 21) are two oracle centers Alexander visited. This implies oracles, temples, pagan religion, gods and goddesses, divine guidance, divinity, the deep questions: How did it all begin? Where did we come from?</p>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">            Going into this trip, I was working from an interpretation of ancient history gained from Zecharia Sitchin that I sought to investigate.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">            Sitchin’s timetable for humanity is: 450,000 B.C., there was the first contact with the 12<sup>th</sup> planet, a planet in our solar system with a 3,600 year interval. It becomes the 12<sup>th</sup>, if you add Pluto, Moon, and Earth to the other eight.  </p>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">            I think that construction of the platform at Baalbek was interrupted by the Deluge<i>,</i> as reported in Baalbek (Chapter 17). Researcher Graham Hancock agrees with me. After the Deluge circa 11,000 B.C. destroyed life forms, humanity was re-seeded by the 12 planet making another pass and producing agriculture (circa  11,000 B.C.), then the Neolithic culture (circa 7,500 B.C.) and, finally, the Sumerian civilization (circa 3,800 B.C.).</p>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">            Notice the 3,600 year intervals. The gods were present among mankind, according to Sitchin’s evidence on Mesopotamian cylinder seals and Hittite rock carvings. In Chapter 13, there is a rock carving with the king meeting with four gods, wearing their distinctive garb. Were the gods present among mankind? How are we to understand these carvings?</p>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">            My only problem with Sitchen is: Why wasn’t the circa 200 B.C. fly by noted by ancient writers? They wrote about Alexander who lived circa 300 B.C. Given the 3,600 year interval, why were there no contemporary notations of the 12 planet’s arrival? A few pages above, I cited many of the ancient historians and geographers who provided written records of the times. They wrote about Alexander, not always contemporaneously, who lived 100 years before the alleged flyby.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">            By the time of Alexander, whatever the details of religious practice, there were, no doubt, various priesthoods that looked back to the so called “first time” (<i>zep tepi</i> in Egyptian).</p>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">            Babylonian priests, for example, told Alexander when he reached Iraq in 331 B.C.) that their records went back 25,000 years.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">            Egyptian priests wrote in the <i>Hermetica</i> that “Egypt is an image of heaven …”, and Robert Bauval (<i>The Orion Mystery</i>) showed how the three pyramids at Giza are laid out to match the belt of Orion in the sky.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">            I believe the Egyptian pyramids and Sphinx were built around 10,500 B.C., just after the Deluge, as reported in the Giza chapter (Chapter 22).</p>
<p style=""margin-left:1.0in;"">            My thoughts and beliefs are based on my own first hand observations, as well as those of others I cite as sources.</p>

He compiled and edited over 400 Sufi tales, published as Big Tales: All the stories in the 12 volumes of The Sufi Message of Hazrat Inayat Khan, The Einstein Academy, Tucson, AZ 2015.
After Mr. Lewis' death in 1971, Mansur started a Sufi Center in Boston, MA, and supported himself by installing auto glass, as well as traveling and teaching Sufism at weekend workshops and seminars. In 1980, Mansur moved to Tucson and found work in the film industry when Hollywood came to Arizona by working in 44 feature films and TV movies as a Grip. He found employment on such big Hollywood local films as Tombstone, Maverick, and The Quick and the Dead.
A member of IATSE, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Mansur transitioned from film to work as a stage carpenter at the University of Arizona’s Centennial Hall for Broadway in Tucson, as well as a Trade Show professional, setting up such events as the Gem & Mineral Show in Tucson.
In 2017 The Einstein Academy published Don’t Search, Celebrate! The Collected poems of Mansur Johnson. Since then, Mansur began work on In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great, The 1998 Footsteps of Alexander the Great Tour, Part 1.

V.  Overview of In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great
                                                                 INTRODUCTION TO PART 1
            I am grateful to Michael Wood for coming out with a book and TV special called In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great while I was preparing for our trip In the Footsteps of Alexander the Great.
            I followed Mr. Wood’s maps, noted his omissions, and expanded his narrow focus. I renamed our trip The 1998 Footsteps of Alexander the Great Tour.
            Why read this book when Michael Wood wrote the book and made the TV show already?
            First, let me say, Michael Wood followed the steps of Alexander to most of the places we visit. Unlike us, he gives the reader Alexander’s great career, his battles and victories, and anecdotes and contradictions from sources, meaning the ancient writers, Arrian, Quintus Curtius, Diodorus of Sicily, and Plutarch, plus Strabo and Pliny, Greek geographers, geographer being another way to characterize one who wrote a descriptive history of people and places from different regions of the world known to his era.
            We followed—I say “we” because my companion was my girl friend from Switzerland, Marianne—the steps of Alexander and learned, like Alexander, what these parts of the world are like, what the land feels like. Like Alexander, we lingered at beautiful places.
            For example, Wood never mentions Phaeselis on the south coast of Turkey. Alexander spent the winter of 334 B.C. in this beautiful place, thus concluding his first year of conquest. We got off track for three days in equally beautiful, neighboring Olympos (Chapter 9), which unlike Phaeselis, was one of Lycia’s six major cities with a vote of 3 each in the Lycian league.
            We sought to learn, like Alexander, the history. History after Alexander, like Roman monuments, was of incidental interest to us. Sometimes the Romans’ utilization of an earlier Alexander site, such as Ephesus (Chapter 5), required that we look at stuff less than 2,000 years old.
           Of particular interest to me was Alexander’s interest in dreams, visions, and prophecy. The Didyma Temple (Chapter 6) and Siwa Oasis (Chapter 21) are two oracle centers Alexander visited. This implies oracles, temples, pagan religion, gods and goddesses, divine guidance, divinity, the deep questions: How did it all begin? Where did we come from?
            Going into this trip, I was working from an interpretation of ancient history gained from Zecharia Sitchin that I sought to investigate.
            Sitchin’s timetable for humanity is: 450,000 B.C., there was the first contact with the 12th planet, a planet in our solar system with a 3,600 year interval. It becomes the 12th, if you add Pluto, Moon, and Earth to the other eight.  
            I think that construction of the platform at Baalbek was interrupted by the Deluge, as reported in Baalbek (Chapter 17). Researcher Graham Hancock agrees with me. After the Deluge circa 11,000 B.C. destroyed life forms, humanity was re-seeded by the 12 planet making another pass and producing agriculture (circa  11,000 B.C.), then the Neolithic culture (circa 7,500 B.C.) and, finally, the Sumerian civilization (circa 3,800 B.C.).
            Notice the 3,600 year intervals. The gods were present among mankind, according to Sitchin’s evidence on Mesopotamian cylinder seals and Hittite rock carvings. In Chapter 13, there is a rock carving with the king meeting with four gods, wearing their distinctive garb. Were the gods present among mankind? How are we to understand these carvings?
            My only problem with Sitchen is: Why wasn’t the circa 200 B.C. fly by noted by ancient writers? They wrote about Alexander who lived circa 300 B.C. Given the 3,600 year interval, why were there no contemporary notations of the 12 planet’s arrival? A few pages above, I cited many of the ancient historians and geographers who provided written records of the times. They wrote about Alexander, not always contemporaneously, who lived 100 years before the alleged flyby.
            By the time of Alexander, whatever the details of religious practice, there were, no doubt, various priesthoods that looked back to the so called “first time” (zep tepi in Egyptian).
            Babylonian priests, for example, told Alexander when he reached Iraq in 331 B.C.) that their records went back 25,000 years.
            Egyptian priests wrote in the Hermetica that “Egypt is an image of heaven …”, and Robert Bauval (The Orion Mystery) showed how the three pyramids at Giza are laid out to match the belt of Orion in the sky.
            I believe the Egyptian pyramids and Sphinx were built around 10,500 B.C., just after the Deluge, as reported in the Giza chapter (Chapter 22).
            My thoughts and beliefs are based on my own first hand observations, as well as those of others I cite as sources.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

For over two years, I experimented with different modalities - blank notebooks, notes in a phone, and voice recordings.  I tried out other gratitude and mindfulness journals or digital templates. I even encouraged friends and family to join me in this journey! Throughout these two years, I observed and took notes of what worked and what did not.  Finally, one day in 2018, I made the decision to create my own gratitude journal!</p><p>I knew that I wanted to create a one-of-a kind journal. One that encouraged both gratitude and accountability. One that inspired both goal-setting and self-reflection. And one that combined philosophy and practicality. Camped out in my favorite coffee shop for numerous long afternoons, I sketched out the format for I Am Grateful. I drew upon my favorite works like <strong>Seven Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey, The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz, The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg and more</strong>. I also incorporated elements inspired by some of the trainings I had attended including Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), Yin Yoga Teacher Training, and Holistic Meditation Teacher Training. For the journal’s monthly deep dive exercises, I collected content from discovery exercises I had given to my health coaching clients and prompts that I received from my own life coaches over the years.</p><p>When I launched edition #1 of I Am Grateful, I made it available wherever I could: my zenergy meditation + yoga studio, my Lizzy’s All Natural healthy smoothie cafes, holiday markets, international schools, and local shops.

The journals were also like time capsules, holding memories and milestones of life’s chapters. It was such a beautiful reminder of all of the good in life, and that gratitude can be a super antidote to emotions like fear, anger and uncertainty. Other people seemed to share a similar sentiment as <strong>all of the I Am Grateful journals had sold out</strong>. So with that, I decided to create a meaningfully updated version of I Am Grateful.</p><p>This spring, I sought out current journalers (some were already using their third copy!) and asked them questions about what they wanted to change, keep, or add.</p><p>The feedback was very clear and pretty consistent overall. <strong>Most journalers loved the simple gratitude structure, the inspiring quotes, the monthly deep dives, and the hardcover 6-month journal design</strong>.

Do you desire to deepen your relationships with others and yourself? Do you want to experience a greater sense of fulfillment?If the answer to these questions is a resounding “YES!” then allow me to let you in a secret...living a life of deep joy and abundance is born out of a SIMPLE practice. It just requires a daily commitment each morning of 5 MINUTES of GRATITUDE. Studies have linked gratitude as a significant factor in improving one’s overall levels of happiness. I am here to help set you on this path of practicing gratitude into what is hopefully a positive, transformative experience that countless other people have already felt through the use of this journal. “Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking.”- Marcus Aurelius A life well lived begins with each day.  How we mentally prepare and set our intentions for the day can impact how we react to the events in our days.  Days become weeks, weeks become months, and months become years so focusing on the tiny blocks of days, can ultimately impact your life..   What is one way to win the day? With a daily practice of gratitude.A life well-lived does not happen passively by waiting for the external circumstances to change. It happens proactively by choosing to feel happy for what you already have and how you are continuing to grow, as a person. Whether it is a sunny or a rainy day, you can always choose to feel the sun within. However, this perspective takes practice, patience, and self-love! After cultivating my own gratitude practice over the past five years and sharing with hundreds of health coaching clients and friends, I’ve designed a new version of a daily journal to make it as simple as possible for anyone to get started in building this life changing habit.  Gratitude is a MINDSET. A mindset is one that colors our perspective. We can always choose to be grateful. Even when we experience setbacks, we can choose to be grateful for the opportunities to learn in those moments. Think about the power and freedom you gain when you can be grateful no matter what happens! You take ownership back of the thing that no one can take away from you - your perspective and ultimately your mood.  And gratitude FEELS AMAZING! It is an opportunity to count our blessings and the gifts that we were born with. It is a mental and emotional reward that makes us smile. It is a deep embodiment of joy and happiness that naturally comes from giving thanks.But do you know what? Gratitude is more than just a warm fuzzy feeling. Research shows that gratitude and mindfulness bring countless physical health benefits ranging from improved immunity to resilience to longevity. In one landmark study completed by UC Davis psychologist Robert Emmons, it was shown that by simply keeping a gratitude journal for three weeks, you can significantly increase well-being: reduce physical pain, ease symptoms of stress, improve your sleep, and your sense of overall life satisfaction.    A great morning routine is one of the best ways to set you up for success.  Ask Ariana Huffington, RIchard Branson, Sheryl Sandberg, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates - all individuals who are known for attributing much of their success to their morning routines. The journal’s design solves the problem that many of us face: overcomplicated or unstructured morning routines that tend to fade as fast as they start. How many times have you started on some journal or program only to leave it after a few days or weeks? By keeping the prompts simple, straightforward, and trackable, we have made it as easy as possible for I Am Grateful (and a gratitude practice) to become a staple in your life. “This journal is for those who seek to enjoy the journey as they create the life of their dreams.” The I Am Grateful journal is an invitation to start each day with powerful, positive intentions. With the clean design, you have the space to complete daily, weekly and monthly exercises to better understand yourself and cultivate positivity across all areas of your life.These exercises train our brains to look for how we can be thankful for what we have and whatever comes our way. While the daily exercise takes only five minutes, you will feel the benefits of this positive mind-shift over the whole day!The journal’s content is instrumental in how you choose to prioritize what is truly important. In order to maximize potential inspiration, self-exploration and mindfulness, we have created a program that builds upon itself. Here is the structure of the journal:Daily: gratitude | affirmations | top priorities | mindful questionInvestment per day: 5 minutesWeekly: reflection questions | intentions for weekInvestment per week: 10-15 minutesMonthly: Self-learning + reflection thought exercisesInvestment per month: 20-30 minutes How does this play out in the pages?The daily prompts start out with asking for just three things you feel grateful for and one positive affirmation. In my experience, keeping it simple significantly increases the chances that your daily entry becomes habitual. This new edition also offers a rotating series of questions that spark curiosity and self exploration.The weekly pages serve as powerful anchors from which the daily entries unfold. In just one page, you get to reflect on topics including how you are choosing to spend your time and if you are taking actions that are aligned with your mission. Previous journalers have stated they have found the weekly page to be a fantastic accountability tool!The monthly deep dives especially present the opportunity to ask yourself potentially life changing questions like: What are my core values? What is my mission statement? What do I envision my life to look like in five years time? These are high leverage exercises that may not come up otherwise in daily life but have a lasting impact on how you choose to live.  Think of your gratitude journal as a way to help increase productivity, health, and happiness. If you want to strengthen your arm muscles, you can head to the gym and lift weights. In order to strengthen your muscles for gratitude, you also need to work them out! Think of the I Am Grateful Journal is your personal gratitude trainer!  “Writing daily in the I am Grateful Journal has become one of my most grounding habits.  It helps me practice gratitude (which I think contributes to my overall happiness) and set my agenda for the upcoming day / week/ month in terms of the things in which I want to achieve.  The amount of reflection the journal facilitates has been instrumental in going after the things that are important to me and helping me achieve those things.  Thanks Lizzy for creating such a helpful tool that has facilitated an overarching positive mind shift!” - Jason, New York, USA “I started the gratitude journal this year in February and was amazed by the impact. Of course I had the feeling being thankful for the small little things in life before already but actively writing them down on a daily basis makes the difference. Besides the motivational quotes as well as challenges and reflective incentives provided by Lizzy in this book make you unfold a much more positive mindset. Now I’m already on the 2nd journal and am grateful for this experience and new habit.” - Laura Louise, Germany ""I never thought I would make the time to practice gratitude / journal everyday, but I Am Grateful makes it easy and rewarding to take a moment that totally sets the tone for the rest of the day. I love the prompt to reflect on my own mentality every morning, the daily quotes or challenges, and that it forces me to better structure my week in addition to just triggering gratitude / self-love"" – Camden, Shanghai, China “I started using Elizabeth Schieffelin’s Gratitude Journal about 4 months ago and have enjoyed every minute of it.  The beauty of this journal is it’s simplicity.  It is easy to fit into a busy lifestyle but still be impactful.  While I expected this purchase to be only a gratitude practice, I have found it to be so much more beneficial.  It allows me to quickly prioritize action items that are actually important to my goals without being a slave to a never ending list of “to-dos”, as well as remind myself to take time for me.  I start my day grateful, grounded and energized.” – Paige, Michigan, USA “Gratitude seems a small thing in life and we thought by saying thank you that we are expressing gratitude. However, true gratitude exceeds those formalities and brings fulfillment in our life. By writing this notebook nearly every morning (using 5-10mins), I gradually develop a positive attitude towards my life. I am genuinely happierand appreciate my life more. And also, I become more self-aware and more resilient.” – Sophie, Shanghai, China  It was early 2016 and I had already been living in the exciting and beautiful city Shanghai, China for three years. The days seemed to fly by as I worked 24/7 to build a healthy smoothie startup, while growing my health coaching practice and trying to juggle what felt like a million other commitments!I spent most of my time in full-on “warrior mode”, constantly fixated on problems to be solved or daydreaming about the future. My friends endearingly called me, “busy Lizzy”. I euphemistically considered busyness to be ‘good stress’ but I started to feel physically and emotionally drained. It got to the point where I was diagnosed with adrenal fatigue verging on burnout.Thankfully, one day a friend (now, my fiance!) gifted me a gratitude journal. The format of the journal was simple – it provided me with a daily reminder to pause, breathe, and reflect on what I was grateful for. It was an invitation to be present. The 5-minute practice each morning started as a relief, a breath of fresh air before seizing the day. But in the months that followed, I noticed a powerful shift. The gratitude I felt expanded beyond those 5-minutes, it reframed my entire worldview into one of abundance, joy, lightness and appreciation.Over time, I felt like an entirely different person. The shift was so fundamental that I knew I had to share this gratitude practice with my health coaching clients and friends.So, I went all-in on gratitude. For over two years, I experimented with different modalities - blank notebooks, notes in a phone, and voice recordings.  I tried out other gratitude and mindfulness journals or digital templates. I even encouraged friends and family to join me in this journey! Throughout these two years, I observed and took notes of what worked and what did not.  Finally, one day in 2018, I made the decision to create my own gratitude journal!I knew that I wanted to create a one-of-a kind journal. One that encouraged both gratitude and accountability. One that inspired both goal-setting and self-reflection. And one that combined philosophy and practicality. Camped out in my favorite coffee shop for numerous long afternoons, I sketched out the format for I Am Grateful. I drew upon my favorite works like Seven Habits of Highly Effective People by Stephen Covey, The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz, The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg and more. I also incorporated elements inspired by some of the trainings I had attended including Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction (MBSR), Yin Yoga Teacher Training, and Holistic Meditation Teacher Training. For the journal’s monthly deep dive exercises, I collected content from discovery exercises I had given to my health coaching clients and prompts that I received from my own life coaches over the years.When I launched edition #1 of I Am Grateful, I made it available wherever I could: my zenergy meditation + yoga studio, my Lizzy’s All Natural healthy smoothie cafes, holiday markets, international schools, and local shops. I hosted a number of gratitude workshops in Shanghai and led 30 day virtual challenges to introduce I am Grateful to a bigger community.The feedback was overwhelmingly positive and impact was wide reaching! Journalers shared comments like:As you can imagine, all of this inspired me to spread the impact to more people! I sent copies to several boutique bookstores in the US for resale and shared directly to interested clients on Instagram. Within months, I Am Grateful journalers spanned the globe.This year, when COVID hit, and the world seemed to turn totally upside down, I was reminded of just how powerful taking a perspective of gratitude really could be. One day during quarantine, I found myself flipping through my old journals. The entries were like a rainy day fund of joy! The journals were also like time capsules, holding memories and milestones of life’s chapters. It was such a beautiful reminder of all of the good in life, and that gratitude can be a super antidote to emotions like fear, anger and uncertainty. Other people seemed to share a similar sentiment as all of the I Am Grateful journals had sold out. So with that, I decided to create a meaningfully updated version of I Am Grateful.This spring, I sought out current journalers (some were already using their third copy!) and asked them questions about what they wanted to change, keep, or add.The feedback was very clear and pretty consistent overall. Most journalers loved the simple gratitude structure, the inspiring quotes, the monthly deep dives, and the hardcover 6-month journal design. They also asked for more variety in the daily mindfulness questions, less focus on time management, more deep dive reflection prompts and a new format for weekly check-ins.After having incorporated feedback from existing I am Grateful journalers and modifications I thought would strengthen a gratitude practice, I am now at the printing stage of edition #2 and am beyond thrilled to be able to bring the new and improved version to life. My gratitude journaling practice has totally changed my life for the better and transformed the way I see the world. My hope is that you too will have the chance to experience the incredible benefits now and for the long-term!With love and gratitude,                            Elizabeth   I Am Grateful Journal ($30 value)The I Am Grateful Journal is a hardcover gratitude journal.

My name is Elizabeth and I’m the founder of By Lizzy, a healthy lifestyle company whose mission is to support physical healing and positive mindshift shifts through practices of health, happiness and self-expression. I’ve been a Holistic Health Coach for the past seven years. I also teach Yin Yoga, offer meditation and sound healing sessions, and practice Reiki energy work. I am deeply passionate about women’s health and empowerment ! Although Shanghai was my home base for the past seven years, I love to travel and lead wellness retreats around the world. You can find me writing, recording videos and sharing what I learn and experience with others through my wechat blog, Instagram @bylizzy_ and website. I am the proud new mom of Lila Grace and can't wait to give her her first gratitude journal one day!   Funds raised from this campaign will go directly to financing the production and launch of I Am Grateful in the US market. Specifically, funding will support:- Proofing and printing the journals- Shipping- Giving away copies to anyone who seeks to build a gratitude practice but is unable to afford the cost of a journal (apply via www.lifebylizzy.com)The first 1,000 journals ordered are set to arrive in the US for fulfillment in December 2020. If everything is on schedule, journals should be shipped out in time for holiday gifting! In the event that production gets delayed (see risks + challenges below), I will update backers ASAP.Additional journals will be printed and sent out by February 2021.  You may not be able to contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help: Please share my Pre-sale Campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family, and network. Please use #IAmGratefulJournal and tag me so I can help amplify your kind efforts. Share Now!  I would like to express my deepest thanks to all who have made this journal and campaign possible! Especially, thank you to:  Daphne + Jupiter, for your video shooting! *Learn about their video shooting/production services by contacting: yu1737@gmail.com Sophia, for your inspiring I Am Grateful journal design, campaign graphic design and video editing! *Learn about her graphic design services by following on IG: @sophia.sze Warren, for your coaching, editing, project management teachings, inspiration and encouragement along this journey.Jason, for your longtime use and championing of I Am Grateful.Camden, Louisa and Izo, for your awesome video testimonials.Molly, for making the journal's printing happen. Tara, for your brilliant proofing eye and unwavering support.And to everyone who contributed feedback that made edition #2 possible!  Two of the big challenges with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer in a timely manner and in the best condition.To address the quality, I am working with my printer to ensure that the journals are hand checked for quality before they are sent out. Also, the journals will be wrapped in protective casing to limit any damage during the shipment.For timing, my intention is to have the journals in the mail in time for the holidays! The delivery of pre-sale copies in a timely manner is based on a) production time of the printing company and b) shipping time and customs clearance. I will be working closely with my printer to make sure that they stay true to a 20 day lead time. This is my second time working with this printing company (the first being edition #1 of I Am Grateful) and I’ve had a fantastic experience working with the team already. I’ve also negotiated with the shipping company to ensure that the journals will be sent within 3 weeks of the print date.I commit to keeping you updated as the journal hits each key milestone and publishing is complete so you know when your journals are expected to be sent out!",21.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Why we need help</h3>
<p>Private Motor Club is an independent publisher reliant on advertising revenue and sales to cover the cost of production. Our most recent issue has just gone to print but 90% of advertising revenue generated was wiped out overnight. Content generation, contributors, photographers, design and print is costly and we rely heavily on our advertising income to keep our business running. Sales are up for the upcoming issue but we need to find new initiatives to survive the challenges we are experiencing and keep paying our contributors.</p>

<p>We don't have investors or qualify for any government support;  in an already challenging industry we have very little flexibility to cope in a unprecedented situation like the current coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<h3>Why now?</h3>
<p>The next issue is due to go to print in June; this means we need to be assigning writers and photographers for features right now. These people are pivotal to PMC, and we want to do our best to support others in the industry. We have planned the next issue with a 'creative' theme which fortunately is not reliant on events that have been cancelled. The issue will be focusing on some of the characters who make the automotive world so interesting.</p>

<h3>The Book: Fred</h3>
<p>Fred is the debut book from the Radical Queer Dinner Party press. It's the memoir of a non-binary queer woman growing up in a liberal but extremely heteronormative world.</p>
<p>The book is a collection of essays that string together the story of coming to terms with a queer identity, fighting through the socially informed voices in our head, and finally facing the darker of our demons to realize that all anybody wants is acceptance.</p>
<p>While there are many queer stories out there, I don't believe there are enough. When will there be enough? Never probably, but next best guess is when you can find a title for any queer person and say, ""you. you need <i>this</i> book."" </p>
<p>We cannot assume that one, two, three, five hundred narratives can possibly illuminate the vast array of queer experiences. Honestly I'd make the argument that it's your political duty to buy this book. </p>
<p>Yes, I am trying to sell you a product using whatever rhetorical means I possibly can, but I'm a nice guy and I'm not good at self-promotion so please consider buying my book!</p>
<h3>The Press: Radical Queer Dinner Party</h3>
<p>My goal with this book is to introduce a new press. Through some combination of online publication, quarterly printed zines, writing grants, and paid opportunities to publish, I'm hoping to make a writing career more accessible to marginalized writers and radical thinkers.</p>
<p>I use the word queer much more broadly (and yet at the same time more specifically) than it is used to describe a gender identity or sexuality. This mission of the press, and the writing it hopes to support, is to analyze our society with a decolonial and anti-racist lens. Writing for RQDP will question damaging social norms, empower writers and readers who challenge socially accepted ways of thinking, and highlight stories that often get overlooked.  </p>
<p>RQDP is an outlet for radical thinking, and a place of genuine learning. The goal of our writing is to help readers reframe how we see the world so that we may begin poking holes in the myths to which we've bound ourselves.</p>
<p>I know this sounds vague, but to me it feels specific. To some degree, buying into this campaign is buying into me, Annie, as editor-in-chief.  </p>
<p>I've been studying the reproduction of cultural myths for at least six years. I've taught lectures on the importance of reading, sharing, understanding, and amplifying marginalized stories. You can visit my website (annsplain[dot]com) to find a syllabus and reading list about debunking and challenging mainstream narratives.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Sales and Funding Goals</h3>
<p>I'm looking to raise 5,000 dollars during this campaign (that's about 300 books). Obviously the more books bought the better and I simply refuse to turn your cash away (that's my promise to you!).</p>
<p>Any money collected will be allocated <strong>first</strong> to the complete printing of Fred. That means hiring a copy-editor to read the manuscript and fix any errors that I might have made (I agree, it seems rather unlikely). It also means hiring a designer to finalize the book visuals. If possible, I'd like to outsource some assistance in organizing the final manuscript for pre-printing.</p>
<p>Once fixed costs for my first print batch have been covered, then any profit earned on books sold thereafter will go into building the press itself. </p>
<p>A press requires some capital investment (tech costs, incorporation costs, etc), but for the most part money spent on the press would simply expand the reach and operations of the project. </p>
<p>The financial strategy behind building this press is to set manageable self-sustaining goals. For instance, beginning a Medium publication online that is well-run, well-curated, and well-publicized will generate income to sustain itself. This introduces a milestone of <b>paying writers for their work.</b></p>
<p>The next effort would involve expanding the reach of the magazine and press, as well as the opportunities that we can provide. While initially focusing on building content as a set of essays curated through Medium allows for a focus on writing, I would like to one day introduce a color printed magazine that can highlight mixed media from artists that reimagine the status quo. Provided that I can <b>pay artists for their work.</b></p>
<p>I'll be the first to admit that I don't have a strategy for BIG business. But I do have a strategy for small business. Which is to build a strong community first and expand organically into a sustainable project.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The greatest challenge to starting a press is maintaining longevity. That being said, even if this project only lasts a couple of years, I think it can still provide a cultural artifact that's of great value to an audience of young radicals.</p>

<h3>KAMPUNG is a collaborative platform where creators of different backgrounds intersect, explore and express a community's identity. The output of every collaboration is a community publication.

<p><strong>Issue 3: Coming of Age </strong></p>
<p>The topic of aging is commonly associated with the elderly but rarely drawn in comparison to the process of growing up. We would like to extend the conversation of aging to youths, and facilitate an intergenerational dialogue on aging and imagining an age-friendly society.  </p>
<p>Kampung Jurong Issue 3 is a guide to aging that showcases the reflections of five pairings of youth and elderly as they explore thematic questions on aging and growing up. Each youth X elderly pair will discuss the following questions: </p>
<p>- How do you know you have grown old/grown-up? <br/>- How was your experience growing old? <br/>- How has the community supported you? </p>
<p>We will then invite the five pairs to articulate their reflections through a form of their interests, ranging from photo essays to sketches, to interviews. The publication will be divided into two parts- the first half features the articles/works by the youths, while the other half features the elderly's perspectives in elderly-friendly text. All the works will be synthesised into a guide to aging, printed in the middle section of the publication.</p>
<p>This publication will be distributed across different institutions in the elderly care sector. </p>

<p><strong>Issue 4: Lost and Found</strong></p>
<p>Heritage is often recounted on a grand scale. However, much of our identity comprises of smaller everyday objects that elude our collective memory and archive. </p>
<p>Issue 4 is an ode to the heritage behind ordinary preloved objects and traces its renewed lives with new owners. We will hold an open call to invite individuals to share preloved items that they would like to give away to someone with knowledge of its history. Interested contributors will pick an item of their interest and meet the owners. They will then inherit a selected item respectively and explore its renewed life from their point of view to interrogate how we ascribe meaning and value to the material. </p>

<h2><strong>Quick Summary</strong></h2>
<p>First things first: Yes, we did it! We have just funded our KICKSTARTER campaign successfully and are in the process of sending our magazine to print! Now we are offering everybody a chance to preorder this extraordinary collector's issue through our new INDIEGOGO INDEMAND campaign!</p>
<h2><strong>About Us</strong></h2>
<p>We are an independent publishing house, based in Vienna, Austria, specialising in high quality collector's issues devoted to rock's biggest acts: Since 2009, we have published German language ""Rock Classics"" issues (independent journalistic projects) dedicated to the likes of AC/DC, LED ZEPPELIN, PINK FLOYD, METALLICA, GUNS N' ROSES, KISS and QUEEN (and many more...). Following the success of our or first crowdfunding campaign (the QUEEN special issue), this IRON MAIDEN collector’s issue will be our second English language version to be made available to fans worldwide and is fully updated and expanded to include additional original features, adding plenty of extra value. With the world still suffering the effects of COVID-19, what could be better than a bit of distraction and joy for music fans worldwide, and what better subject to lighten the mood, ease the mind, and enjoy the moment than IRON MAIDEN? Aside from this, you would be supporting independent music journalism and magazine publishing at a critical time for the industry.</p>
<h2><strong>A Brief Overview Of Content </strong></h2>
<p>The IRON MAIDEN Special Collector’s Edition celebrates the 40th anniversary of the release of IRON MAIDEN’s debut album and features the full history of the band as told through its studio album discography, including analysis, the source material behind the songs, and little-known facts. It also includes sections devoted to IRON MAIDEN films, literature, and memorabilia, as well as special features including BRUCE DICKINSON’s solo career and vinyl rarities. In addition, it also features several interviews, including a brand new interview with original singer PAUL DI’ANNO, and many rare photos.</p>

<h2><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h2>
<p>We have already funded the project through a first successful campaign but there is still a chance to preorder the regular magazine at this stage through this INDIEGOGO INDEMAND campaign - you have the choice between a single magazine or several packages including cool merch!</p>
<p>Check it out:</p>

<h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>We are an independent music magazine publisher from Vienna/Austria - being around since 1995 we have experienced a severe challenge through the ongoing Covid-19 crisis. Trying to be less dependent on advertising revenue we have decided to take our successful collector's series global. You will continue to help us bringing this series of collector's magazines to a new level and making it available to an audience worldwide after our first success with our QUEEN collector's magazine. Thanks for joining us on this journey!</p>

<h2><strong>Risks And Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>We will start shipping not later than end of February, but unforeseen challenges or delays due to the ongoing Corona-crisis can not be totally ruled out, e.g., if postal service restrictions continue unexpectedly for a longer time period. Even then, delivery later than end of March 2021 is not expected and your order is likely to arrive much earlier. Another minor issue is the fact that depending on the value of the goodie package you choose, you may be asked to pay import duty if you live outside the European Union. Import duty is highly unlikely to be imposed on a single magazine itself, however.</p>
<h2><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h2>
<p>We would simply appreciate it if you spread the word, especially if you know some IRON MAIDEN fans or people who want to support independent music journalism. Any additional social media presence is extremely helpful, thank you!</p>
<p>Please note, that is a purely journalistic project and not officially affiliated or endorsed by the band or its management.</p>
