<p>Welcome to The Gedebo Project, a non-profit organization wtih the goal of raising money to build, fund, and maintain a 2000 sq ft Orphange in Ethiopia.</p>
<p>I would like to explain to you how it started , what it is and why we are doing it.</p>
<p>5 years ago my wife and I adopted 2 siblings from Ethiopia, from the first day we were brought together we knew that this was meant to be, an instant family of four. A few months into Canadian life and with her new grasp of our language our  5 year old daughter was finally able to share the news she'd be sitting on unable to explain. They had an older brother that was left behind and they worried about him desperately. With a few lucky breaks and a trip back to Africa my wife Treena was able to locate their older brother and after a few years of waiting and hard work we were able to bring him home to be reunited with his siblings. The childrens last name in Ethiopia was/is Gedebo. We have been fortunate to been gifted land in the villiage of Doyogena, Ethiopia. We are</p>
<p>now using that land to build a 2000sq ft orphanage in the villiage our Long term goal is $150,000 and we will continue to fundraise after its built to maintain the yearly expenses. We have a website <a href=""http://thegedeboproject.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://thegedeboproject.com/</a>. I have added the video of the kids reuninion to give you a look at the potential of these kids.

<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>Thomas Weller is a Good Sumaritan who would simply like the world to be a better place. He traveled the highways of San Diego, in a Ghostbuster-inspired rescue vehicle, helping those in need of roadside assistance, for no price at all.<br/><br/>According to Steve Hartman, from CBS's ""On The Road"" segment, Mr. Weller offers those he helps a card reading: 'Assisting you has been my pleasure. Pass on the favor by helping someone in distress that you may encounter.'""</p>
<p>Furthermore, the CBS news site states:</p>
<p><em>It's the same message Tom first heard 40 years ago after he plowed his car into an Illinois snow bank.</em></p>
<p><em>""I probably would have froze there if this fellow hadn't stopped and helped me,"" Weller recalled.</em></p>
<p><em>Since then, Tom has paid the favor forward more than 5,000 times.</em></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Recently, CBS aired another segment telling of Mr. Weller's story. However, this time, there was sad news: Mr. Weller's rescue car had been totaled after he was cut-off on the highway, and he doesn't have the money to repair it. This hinders his efforts.</p>
<p>This charity has been created to raise $10,000 to go toward the costs to repair his rescue vehicle. Let's lend a helping hand to a man who has helped thousands of people.</p>

<h3>WOMEN OWNED AND RUN</h3>
<p>Two women. Both passionate about Women and Family Health. Both graced with an entrepreneurial spirit and a desire to create a healing space and local shop for hard to find Ayurvedic Medicines and fresh whole food supplies.</p>

<h3>
<br/>WHAT IS AN AYURVEDIC HEALTH SUPPLY SHOP?</h3>
<p>We get it, it sounds abstract but it is really quite awesome. So if you bear with us, we have included photos and descriptions of the unique and hard to find products we will carry. Ayurveda is the 5000+ year old sister science to Yoga and is in charge of the physical and mental aspects of optimal health. We will carry a full herbal pharmacy that goes way beyond tinctures, teas and capsules, although we will have those too. Here is a brief list of what we will carry, to give you an idea of what makes us different from your typical herbal store.</p>

Two women. Both passionate about Women and Family Health. Both graced with an entrepreneurial spirit and a desire to create a healing space and local shop for hard to find Ayurvedic Medicines and fresh whole food supplies.
Ahara Rasa Ayurveda is the dreamchild of Ayurvedic Health Practitioners and LMT's, Amita Magid and Andrea Shuman. We both specialize in fertility, pregnancy and postpartum care.  (Click here to see our special services). We have each been in the holistic healthcare field for over 15 years and are expanding our private practices into a community center and adding an Ayurvedic Health Supply Shop! 3% of profits will go to our ""Mothering the Mothers"" fund.

WHAT IS AN AYURVEDIC HEALTH SUPPLY SHOP?
We get it, it sounds abstract but it is really quite awesome. So if you bear with us, we have included photos and descriptions of the unique and hard to find products we will carry. Ayurveda is the 5000+ year old sister science to Yoga and is in charge of the physical and mental aspects of optimal health. We will carry a full herbal pharmacy that goes way beyond tinctures, teas and capsules, although we will have those too. Here is a brief list of what we will carry, to give you an idea of what makes us different from your typical herbal store.
 

Organic Ayurvedic Herbal Pharmacy:
Custom made formulas and traditional formulations. Herbally medicated oils and ghees. Herbal jams and medicinal wines. Syrups and tea blends.
 

Whole Medicinal and Culinary bulk herbs and spices: 
Fresh ground at purchase, organic always and local when possible.
 

Ayurvedic Hygiene Products:
Tongue scrapers, neti pots, detox kits, fresh homemade tooth powders and mouthwashes, copper drinking cups, enema kits and sitz baths.
 
   
Basic Ayurvedic Whole Food Supplies:
In-house fresh-made Ahara Rasa ghee, dahl, fresh curry leaves, rice, breakfast grains, dried fruit and fresh grain flours gound to order.
 

Complimentary Support Products:
Therapeutic Grade essential oils, delicious herbal coffee substitutes, hand-made herbal sweets (laddu's) and much more!

 
What Your Participation will do for us:
This campaign will help us to make the leap from small private practice, to a community Ayurvedic Center and Supply Store. It has been our dream since the beginning to have a community hub, where people feel at home in our place of business as well as a one-stop-shop for all things Ayurveda, which is a brand new concept and well embraced by the yoga community (as yoga is the sister science to Ayurveda). Your contribution will change our lives! It will help us to stock our retail store and our complete Ayurvedic Herbal Pharmacy! This will HUGELY help us and give us the opportunity to THRIVE as a business, right away!  So thank you in advance for your support and participation!
What we need:
We need a minimum of $10,800 to get off the ground!  Every penny will go to the folllowing: 
Kitchen and Herb-Store Equipment: Kitchen-aid, Vitamix, cooktop, flour grinder, stainless steel prep table, sinks, etc.
Our first round of inventory: Herbs, containers and products defined above as well as additional supports as needed.
 
What happens If we beat our goal?
Up to $10,000 above the goal, we will add a greenhouse and plant/maintain a local garden of Ayurvedic herbs that can be grown sustainably and locally. Community participation is encouraged in our garden!
Anything we receive above $20,800 will go directly to our ""Mothering the Mothers"" fund to help medium and low income postpartum women with their recovery, which may include proper meals, herbal formulas, body therapies and healthcare, and postpartum doula care click here for this info. Depending on the need, this fund serves to drastically lower or completely eliminate the cost for postpartum care.

<p>Well, hello. We are Abe Choe, Daniel Lee and Vinh Luu<span class=""st"">—</span>three entrepreneurs who are obsessed with school spirit and being our own bosses.</p>
<p>We <em>love</em> our Ducks<span class=""st"">—</span>so much so that we founded <a href=""http://www.shopulife.com/pages/about-us"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ulife</a> (while we were still in college) to make the kind of University of Oregon (UO) branded products we wanted to buy but couldn’t find in stores. Let’s just say, Puddles is proud like a papa duck.</p>
<p>But we need your help.</p>
<p>We’re ready to order UO-branded iPhone5 and iPad3 cases, and to do that, we need the moola (AKA cash money) to place the order. We already have an awesome manufacturer. We have an innovative team and a new online store. We even have shelf space in The Duck Store, Walgreens, The Mac Store and Made in Oregon. And yeah, we have our own <a href=""http://www.shopulife.com/blogs/news/5988094-ulife-contest-best-touchdown-celebration-dance"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">touchdown dance</a> too.</p>
<p>By making a contribution to Ulife, you'll enable us to bring you sleek, stylish technology swag that showcases your infatuation with your Ducks.</p>
<p>Thanks to the help of a few family members and friends who agreed to invest in the company, Ulife got the foundation it needed. We then applied for ABC’s Shark Tank season four and made it to the final video submission rounds. We barely missed making it for season 4. We'll try again next season.  Going forward, we are running this Indiegogo campaign and are hoping to prove that raising capital doesn’t have to be the hardest part of growing a startup and spreading some Duck love.</p>
<h3>Contributor Perks</h3>
<p>In exchange for your contribution, we've got some seriously cool stuff to give away, including Ulife products, a photo shoot with Puddles, and a pair of tickets to the Duck game on November 17, 2012 against Stanford (we're talking seats on the 45 yard line, only nine rows back). For full details, check out the perk boxes to the right.</p>
<h3>Side Note: We Give Back to Students</h3>
<p>Part of the Ulife culture involves giving back, specifically to students. For every UO product sold via the <a href=""http://www.shopulife.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ulife website</a>, Ulife donates $2 to a UO textbook fund. Prior to the start of each college term, a Ulife contest is held. Winners receive up to $250 to purchase textbooks. This is Ulife’s way of supporting students and inspiring them to give back to their communities. Pretty sweet, right?</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can’t afford to help us out, we totally understand. But we hope you’ll spread the word about our fundraising campaign by talking to UO students, UO alumni, your rich uncles and other crazy, loaded Duck fans. If you happen to rub elbows with Phil Knight, don’t hesitate to send him our way. And of course, support us by liking us on Facebook and following us on Twitter.

<p>In 2010, Haiti was devastated by an earthquake, killing and estimated 300,000 and leaving more than one million people homeless. I had the wonderful experience of visiting Haiti with Habitat for Humanity in 2011. Working from sun up to sun down, I helped build 2 homes in a week. We actually did not finish the homes completely but we did as much as we could. Habitat and the homeowners promised to finish and they did! Last year a part of my team returned and sent me pics. The homes even had beautiful gardens. The people of Haiti are dedicated to building a better life.</p>
<div class=""user-content"">
<p>This February, I'm going back! This time with the Grace Fuller Center.</p>
<p>We will build a duplex home as part of the Lambi Project, which includes homes, communal bathhouses, latrines and a community center. The families selected to receive these homes are among those living in the tents that border the Lambi site. That means these people have been living in tents for 3 years! The project will complete 60 homes and include flood control measures.</p>
<p>To help mw with this trip, I will need $1400 to cover a donation to the build, the materials and the skilled laborers we need, food, lodging, in country transportation and health/medical insurance for the duration of your trip. </p>
<p>If I don't reach my goal, the funds will still go to the Fuller Center to help with future home builds. (Each house will cost approximately $8,000 to build). </p>
<p>Thank you so much for reading this and please help me share this project via the Indiegogo sharing tools!</p>

Cocoon Project is working to improve the lot of poor women and children at the Happy Home Orphanage
in Puttaparthi, India. We're doing all we can do to advance women's
equality and empowerment. ""Pride in Productivity"" is our byline - giving hope, not handouts, we're
inspiring change. Our Happy Home Sewing Project will provide fair-wage employment, skill training, and housing for some of these women and others living in villages outside Puttaparthy. These women have been locked into the cycle of poverty and are now living in tents.  We are currently in the process of building a workshop and another building where these women can live and work on the grounds of the Happy Home Orphanage where some have placed children whom they cannot support. So besides upgrading these women's skill levels and providing them with good jobs, they will be able to spend more time with their children. They will be sewing our own designs, and we will be marketing their products both in India and in the U.S. We need to raise $4,500 to build the workspace, living space, purchase sewing machines and material and pay the workers a living wage until we reach profitability.  If we do not reach the entire goal, whatever we do raise will go toward this project. Even a small contribution will make a tremendous difference in the lives of these women.A bit about Happy Home Orphanage:   the nearby Happy Home Orphanage is a non-profit organisation dedicated to improving the welfare of orphans, street children and homeless people by providing them with housing, feeding and education.  Happy Home provides a loving and nurturing environment in which children with traumatic backgrounds can start a new life. 
Most of the children are indigent street urchins who come from the lower economic section of the society and who have not had the privilege of any kind of homecare or education, which means they have no formal education what-so-ever even at the age 9 or 10. They are hungry, unkempt and scared before they enter our home. Their main focus for survival is food. We start preparing them to feel safe, secure and happy as they have security of a room, guidance, and of course nutritious food.Not all our students are orphans though, some are brought to us by their parents who know they will have better opportunities at Happy Home.         Our aim is to mold the character of our children into
strong and honest individuals with full confidence and courage to become good,
pure and self-reliant adults.  We
believe that providing a safe and loving environment will help these young
people develop into kind, thoughtful, responsible and friendly people.
Our Sewing Project has already made a big difference. 
Vasantha is
the first woman to work at Cocoon. She got married when she was only fifteen.
She and her sister got married on the same day. After one year her husband
abandoned her, leaving her in a rented room by herself.  Vasantha didn't know at the time that
she was three months pregnant.  She
was so sick she could not work because of her stress and emotional trauma, so she
went home to stay with her parents, and then to her husband's home.
Unfortunately, her mother- and father-in-law rejected her, believing that the
baby wasn't their son's child. She was totally alone, frightened and
emotionally fragile.


A kind lady
from her neighborhood took her in to her home to help her, giving her job
cleaning the house and taking care of her baby. This kind lady helped Vasantha
with milk and housing after her baby was born. Soon after Vasantha gave birth
to her baby girl, she became deaf in both ears. Her life was so unbearable that
she thought that if she did not have her daughter she would have killed
herself.She did not
want to live in this miserable state. For so long she had felt no love or
compassion from the people who were supposed to love and care for her, relying
solely on the kindness of strangers. She felt unloved and alone except for her
own daughter. She hated her life. Her heart became like a stone. Vasantha came
to the Happy Home to work in 2013. When she first came she was very sad and
never smiled, but that soon changed.When Cocoon was started this year, Vasantha
was very interested in learning a skill and working to earn money for her
herself and her daughter and also to help others. She said ""I feel that
the world is beautiful now and I don't want to leave world anymore, I want to
live ever and ever after.'' Vasantha is so grateful for the help and support
that Cocoon has given her, and for the love from everyone involved. She now
loves everything she is doing, and has hope for the future.

a pour finalité sociale d’amplifier
nos efforts pour la réappropriation de notre alimentation et de notre santé.  Comment?

Vidya va mettre à votre disposition, si nous réalisons notre objectif, un site internet interactif qui vous permettra, après avoir répondu à quelques questions 'ayurvédiques', de créer votre fiche santé, et de générer un mois de recettes adaptées à votre type psycho-corporel, avec une liste d'ingrédients, les quantités à acheter, les prix indicatifs et où se les procurer.

nous organiserons des cours de cuisine santé selon l'Ayurvéda,
divers ateliers: faire ses courses bio pas cher, utiliser les épices pour se soigner et mieux digérer, perdre du poids lentement mais sainement,
des conférences de conscientisation,
des actions directes pour challenger les acteurs européens et faire entendre VOTRE voix, VOTRE avis, VOTRE droit à la santé.
via notre page Facebook déjà existante et pleine de recettes, de conseils santé, livres à télécharger, reportages, et tout cela gratuitement :)
et notre chaîne YouTube, riche en reportages de qualité sur l'Ayurvéda et les dessous de l'industrie.

 ""Bonjour, je suis Alain Minnoy, 42 ans, ex 'gars du système', qui travaillait dans une multinationale multi hiérarchisée.  Un jour, j'ai eu une prise de conscience fulgurante, il fallait que le travail que j'accomplis soit en accord avec mes principes et surtout utile à la planète et à l'autre.  C'est en Inde que j'ai découvert l'Ayurvéda et j'ai poursuivi ma formation à Tapovan en Normandie.Après 8 années de pratique et 25 kg de moins, je suis prêt à partager mon expérience en diététique et nutrition holistique avec vous.""""Salut, je suis Grégory Dahan, j’ai 34 ans, j’ai travaillé pendant 10 ans en tant que consultant en stratégie d’entreprise spécialisé en ressources humaines pour diverses multinationales.
Oui j’étais celui qui aidait à restructurer et à informatiser les process internes des entreprises. Il y a 1 an, j’ai décidé de tout quitter pour créer ma start’up en stratégie qui a pour but d’aider les petites entreprises à s’en sortir dans le marché actuel en pleine transformation. (Elle sera lancée en Septembre)
J’ai également décidé de m’engager dans la société civile pour essayer de faire changer notre société actuelle qui ne tourne plus rond. 
C’est lors de ce processus de création que j’ai rencontré Alain et que j'ai décidé de me joindre à lui dans la création de Vidya qui sera je l’espère grâce à vous une plateforme de lutte contre la « malbouffe », les OGM et autres horreurs que l’on veut nous faire accepter de gré ou de force.""En Inde, Alain a fait une belle rencontre, Organic India :Au cœur d’ORGANIC INDIA se trouve leur engagement à personnifier l’amour et la conscience en action. Ils travaillent avec milliers de petites familles de fermiers en Inde qui cultivent à l’ancienne et sans pesticides au total des dizaines de milliers d’acres de terres arable. Tous leurs produits promeuvent la santé et le bien-être, et sont réalisés avec le plus grand soin.Organic India, depuis plus de 15 ans, lutte activement et avec succès contre les multinationales agroalimentaires en Inde, et permet peu à peu aux fermiers de reprendre possession de leur terres, de les assainir, et de cultiver des produits d’une qualité exceptionnelle.Suivons leur exemple en important chez nous ces valeurs, en menant notre lutte à leur côté, pour éviter l’introduction des OGM dans nos assiettes.Les valeurs de notre partenaire Organic India sont aussi celles de Vidya.Organic India possède toutes les certifications nécessaires pour garantir la qualité de ses produits, car il contrôle toute sa chaîne: production, distribution, transformation.  Il n'y a aucun sous-traitant ni intermédiaire.Organic India a également créé un nouveau standard dans le monde de l'économie durable, EARTHSEER pour s'assurer non seulement de la qualité des produits, mais du respect de tous les acteurs de la chaîne, de la Terre, en passant par le fermier et l'employé, jusqu'à l'utilisateur final, càd nous. Grâce à votre contribution, nous pourrons importer des épices, des plantes ayurvédiques sèches certifiées bio et Fairtrade ainsi que quelques autres produits de consommation courante depuis l'Inde et les mettre à votre disposition en Belgique (tous nos produits) et en Europe (épices uniquement). Nos produits alimentaires secs certifiés d’origine biologiques  et sans OGM sont issus du commerce équitable (épices indiennes, riz, infusions curatives, …) Nos produits seront acheminés depuis l'Inde par bateau, ce qui consomme au minimum dix fois moins de carburant que par voie terrestre ou aérienne. Quelles sont les émissions de CO2 produites par le transport maritime ?Les navires font partie des modes de transport les moins polluants. Ils émettent entre 10 et 15 g par tonne-kilomètre, contre de 19 à 41 g/tkm pour le rail, de 51 à 91 g/tkm pour la route et de 673 à 867 g/tkm pour le transport aérien.Nos produits seront ensuite transportés vers notre espace de stockage à Bruxelles et distribués dans divers points de vente, comme les magasins et marchés bio, les cafés, restaurants 'green' et les centres bien-être, mais seront également disponibles via notre site de e-commerce.En résumé, voici ce que l'on vous propose en échange de votre contribution:
Améliorer sa santé en se faisant plaisir, tout en respectant son budget.
Devenir acteur et cocréateur d'une économie éthique et durable.
Etre personnellement impliqué dans le développement d’un mode de consommation plus responsable et respectueux de l’environnement.
Des moyens concrets pour améliorer votre nutrition (cours, recettes, ...)
Faciliter un retour à un mode de vie plus naturel.
Soutenir une cause qui aura un impact positif sur la planète et notre quotidien à tous et à toutes.

2) Plantes ayurvédiques- Le Tulsi  (Basilic Sacré) -Le Tulsi est un produit encore très peu répandu sur le marché, et le Tulsi Organic India est certifié d'origine biologique et d'une qualité incomparable.Description du TulsiDepuis plus de 5000 ans, le Tulsi (aussi connu sous le nom de Basilic Sacré) est considéré en Inde comme la ""Reine des Herbes"" et y est révérée comme l'une des plantes les plus sacrées de l'Inde, infusée d'un pouvoir de guérison.Les feuilles de Tulsi sont utilisées pour faire un thé délicieux et rafraîchissant aux multiples vertus curatives.Tandis que le Tulsi voyageait le long des premières routes commerciales de l'Orient vers l'Europe, il devint connu des Chrétiens comme basilic ""saint"" ou ""sacré"", comme on peut le voir reflété dans son nom latin botanique: Ocimum sanctum.La recherche moderne a classifié le Tulsi en tant que plante adaptogène.  Les plantes adaptogènes ont prouvé leur effet positif sur le système immunitaire tout en amoindrissant les effets négatifs du stress.Ces plantes adaptogènes sont utilisées en médecine ayurvédique et chinoise depuis des milliers d'années afin de promouvoir et de maintenir la santé.  Bien des plantes adaptogènes ont été qualifiées par les herboristes de rajeunissantes, énergisantes et reconstituantes.  Elles aident le corps à s'adapter aux facteurs de stress environnementaux, physiques et émotionnels, assurent un bon fonctionnement du corps et restaurent l'équilibre.Le Tulsi Organic India est certifié bio, cultivé sans pesticides et inclus des feuilles de Tulsi de 3 variétés différentes: Rama, Vana et Krishna.  Chaque variété a une apparence, un goût et une fragrance bien caractéristique, qui lorsqu'on les combine, crée une infusion parfaitement équilibrée aux multiples vertus curatives:
Soulagement et protection face au stress quotidien

Augmente l'immunité

Riche en antioxydants

Accroît l'endurance

Adaptogène puissant
Facilite la digestion
Anti-vieillissement

I'm <b>Jason Weiland</b>, the Chief Big Head at BigHeadBoy Media. <b>Our Elegant Minds</b> is our first effort to bring <b>innovation to the mental health industry</b>.</p><p>Worldwide about 1 percent of the population is diagnosed with schizophrenia or related disorders, and approximately 1.2% of Americans (3.2 million) have the disorders. About 1.5 million people will be diagnosed with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder this year around the world</p><p>I recognized some opportunities to help people affected by severe mental illnesses back <b>when I was first diagnosed</b> with <b>Schizoaffective Disorder</b> over 15 years ago; where I have psychotic symptoms, alternating with severe mood symptoms. I have dealt with mental illness my whole life, but this diagnoses was completely new to me and I tried to find out as much as I could about what I could expect. I was sadly left without much information, support or guidance from the internet or the medical professionals “<i>helping</i>” me.</p><p>Currently, more information is available, but there are still very few places a disordered person can go for <b>help</b>, <b>support</b> and <b>compassion</b> where they don't feel <b>labeled</b> and <b>put into a box</b>. I know that above all we want to find a place where we feel like we matter and where we can talk and vent without fear of prejudice or stigma. We need a place to go to find out information and guidance from all points of view, from people experienced in dealing with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.</p><p>Our Elegant Minds promises to fulfill these needs and more. I started this project after a very bad period in my life because I didn't want others to have to experience what I was feeling. But it has grown in scope and scale from those first days, and I know, with your help, that<b> my team and I can bring you a wonderful, thriving community</b>. Seeing this project to fruition has become my purpose in life and I would love nothing more than to see it helping as many people as possible for a long time to come.</p><p>By backing Our Elegant Minds, you are enabling us to bring <b>information</b>, <b>resources</b>, <b>support</b> and <b>community</b> to a group of people who really <b>need our help</b>. Our team will deliver articles, special reports, helpful videos, weekly features like “Ask the Doctor” and a safe and secure forum where people can interact with their peers without fear of being stigmatized or their comments being broadcast to the world like often happens in groups on other social media sites.</p><p>We want to enable our members to be <b>successful</b>, no matter what level they are functioning. We will be there for the person who may be making their first steps and just need help getting out of bed, to those who may be struggling to keep a career in the face of mounting symptoms and problems coping with stressors. </p><p>We also will help those who <b>care for someone suffering</b> from these disorders, because we know how hard it is for those who love someone with a severe mental illness. Being a caregiver to a child or spouse can sometimes feel like a thankless job, but it is so important. <b>Connect</b> with other who share the same path with you.</p><p>With your help, we can offer all of this and more!</p><h2>What We Need</h2><p>To keep Our Elegant Minds running for 3 months, at which point we will be self-sufficient, we are pushing for $30,000. <b>Compared to the value</b> of what we will be bringing to our members, this probably doesn't seem like much money, but from experience we have learned to run our business lean, but still provide a superior product.</p><p>Some items that the money will fund are:</p><ul>
<li><p>Marketing and Promotion</p></li>
<li><p>Hosting and Software</p></li>
<li><p>Salaries for our writers, designers and videographers</p></li>
<li><p>Video equipment and software</p></li>
<li><p>Stock photography and professional graphic design</p></li>
<li><p>Website development and maintenance</p></li>
<li><p>Taxes</p></li>
<li><p>Rewards and Perks</p></li>
</ul><h2>Whats in it For You</h2><p>Beside the <b>warm feeling</b> you get from helping a worthy cause, we have arranged a few interesting perks you will get for your pledge. From bumper stickers to t-shirts, we have a load of fun items. Our favorite is the chance to get a 6 month, 1 year or lifetime membership to Our Elegant Minds for you or you could donate it to someone in need.</p><p>For those who want a chance to help us with the ideas and suggestions to help us build our community, become an <b>Elegant Sustainer</b> with a $1000 pledge and become a <b>mentor</b> for the Our Elegant Minds community.<br/></p><p>If you like to write, you can become an <b>Elegant Author </b>with a $75 pledge and write an article that will be published on the finished community website.</p><p>Also added, is either access to our ""<b>Virtual Launch Party</b>"" or at the higher levels, the chance to be present at the event in <b>Tucson, Arizona</b>.</p><p>If you make a commitment of $2500 or over, you will be added to our ""<b>Virtual Board of Directors</b>"" and help us to shape and develop the Our Elegant Minds community and it's future. Be a part of something awesome!</p><p>We also will have a number of stretch goals in which we will add new and unique rewards, so keep up with the updates on this campaign page!</p><h2>The Impact of Our Elegant Minds</h2><p>This website will not only provide a long-awaited sense of <b>community and purpose</b> for our members, but it will provide much-needed <b>resources and help</b> for a beleaguered medical community trying to help a huge group of people with minimal money and resources. In order for we as a society to help those who most need it, we need to change the way we have been doing things and try some alternate forms of guidance and direction for the disordered and lost.</p><p>The more that private companies like BigHeadBoy Media <b>step forward and provide help</b>, the less that our society will have to rely on our bloated tax system to cover the costs of care.</p><p>Our goal is to reach 1000 members by the end of 2015. That is 1000 people more than are being helped today. After that realistic and attainable goal for year 1, we hope to double membership every year until we get over 100,000 members enrolled by year 8. To reach that goal of 100,000, which is approximately 3% of the schizophrenia and schizoaffective disordered population in the U.S.A., we intend to utilize a marketing campaign to showcase the site’s resources and how it can be helpful to those with these illnesses and the people who care for them. So 1000 members in the 1st year, and 100,000 in the 8th year...it adds up; it is realistic; and it is a conservative estimate.</p><h2>Reaching Out to the Community</h2><p>As a way to provide more help to the mental health community, and specifically those affected by schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, we are pledging to donate $1 from each paid monthly membership.

I'm Jason Weiland, the Chief Big Head at BigHeadBoy Media. Our Elegant Minds is our first effort to bring innovation to the mental health industry.Worldwide about 1 percent of the population is diagnosed with schizophrenia or related disorders, and approximately 1.2% of Americans (3.2 million) have the disorders. About 1.5 million people will be diagnosed with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder this year around the worldI recognized some opportunities to help people affected by severe mental illnesses back when I was first diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder over 15 years ago; where I have psychotic symptoms, alternating with severe mood symptoms. I have dealt with mental illness my whole life, but this diagnoses was completely new to me and I tried to find out as much as I could about what I could expect. I was sadly left without much information, support or guidance from the internet or the medical professionals “helping” me.Currently, more information is available, but there are still very few places a disordered person can go for help, support and compassion where they don't feel labeled and put into a box. I know that above all we want to find a place where we feel like we matter and where we can talk and vent without fear of prejudice or stigma. We need a place to go to find out information and guidance from all points of view, from people experienced in dealing with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder.Our Elegant Minds promises to fulfill these needs and more. I started this project after a very bad period in my life because I didn't want others to have to experience what I was feeling. But it has grown in scope and scale from those first days, and I know, with your help, that my team and I can bring you a wonderful, thriving community. Seeing this project to fruition has become my purpose in life and I would love nothing more than to see it helping as many people as possible for a long time to come.By backing Our Elegant Minds, you are enabling us to bring information, resources, support and community to a group of people who really need our help. Our team will deliver articles, special reports, helpful videos, weekly features like “Ask the Doctor” and a safe and secure forum where people can interact with their peers without fear of being stigmatized or their comments being broadcast to the world like often happens in groups on other social media sites.We want to enable our members to be successful, no matter what level they are functioning. We will be there for the person who may be making their first steps and just need help getting out of bed, to those who may be struggling to keep a career in the face of mounting symptoms and problems coping with stressors. We also will help those who care for someone suffering from these disorders, because we know how hard it is for those who love someone with a severe mental illness. Being a caregiver to a child or spouse can sometimes feel like a thankless job, but it is so important. Connect with other who share the same path with you.With your help, we can offer all of this and more!What We NeedTo keep Our Elegant Minds running for 3 months, at which point we will be self-sufficient, we are pushing for $30,000. Compared to the value of what we will be bringing to our members, this probably doesn't seem like much money, but from experience we have learned to run our business lean, but still provide a superior product.Some items that the money will fund are:
Marketing and Promotion
Hosting and Software
Salaries for our writers, designers and videographers
Video equipment and software
Stock photography and professional graphic design
Website development and maintenance
Taxes
Rewards and Perks
Whats in it For YouBeside the warm feeling you get from helping a worthy cause, we have arranged a few interesting perks you will get for your pledge. From bumper stickers to t-shirts, we have a load of fun items. Our favorite is the chance to get a 6 month, 1 year or lifetime membership to Our Elegant Minds for you or you could donate it to someone in need.For those who want a chance to help us with the ideas and suggestions to help us build our community, become an Elegant Sustainer with a $1000 pledge and become a mentor for the Our Elegant Minds community.If you like to write, you can become an Elegant Author with a $75 pledge and write an article that will be published on the finished community website.Also added, is either access to our ""Virtual Launch Party"" or at the higher levels, the chance to be present at the event in Tucson, Arizona.If you make a commitment of $2500 or over, you will be added to our ""Virtual Board of Directors"" and help us to shape and develop the Our Elegant Minds community and it's future. Be a part of something awesome!We also will have a number of stretch goals in which we will add new and unique rewards, so keep up with the updates on this campaign page!The Impact of Our Elegant MindsThis website will not only provide a long-awaited sense of community and purpose for our members, but it will provide much-needed resources and help for a beleaguered medical community trying to help a huge group of people with minimal money and resources. In order for we as a society to help those who most need it, we need to change the way we have been doing things and try some alternate forms of guidance and direction for the disordered and lost.The more that private companies like BigHeadBoy Media step forward and provide help, the less that our society will have to rely on our bloated tax system to cover the costs of care.Our goal is to reach 1000 members by the end of 2015. That is 1000 people more than are being helped today. After that realistic and attainable goal for year 1, we hope to double membership every year until we get over 100,000 members enrolled by year 8. To reach that goal of 100,000, which is approximately 3% of the schizophrenia and schizoaffective disordered population in the U.S.A., we intend to utilize a marketing campaign to showcase the site’s resources and how it can be helpful to those with these illnesses and the people who care for them. So 1000 members in the 1st year, and 100,000 in the 8th year...it adds up; it is realistic; and it is a conservative estimate.Reaching Out to the CommunityAs a way to provide more help to the mental health community, and specifically those affected by schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, we are pledging to donate $1 from each paid monthly membership. The proceeds will go to The Johns Hopkins Schizophrenia Center for their excellent work in patient care, research, education and outreach.We will also always be on the lookout for new opportunities to help the community and give where it is needed.The Team at Our Elegant MindsBesides Jason Weiland, joining our team as Medical Director is Dr. Carlo Carandang, MD, FAPA. Dr. Carandang is a psychiatrist and has over 15 years experience dealing with mental illnesses in multiple settings. Please go to the BigHeadBoy Media website for a full bio of Dr. Carandang. We will also be teaming up with other mental health professionals as well as authors, gurus and bloggers to bring you a community of information, help and guidelines a person with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder can use with their doctor and therapist to help them work through the pain, uncertainty and confusion they may be feeling from dealing with these demanding illnesses.Risks and ChallengesWe are very realistic and know we will face obstacles along the way, but we have plans and contingencies for the unexpected. We know there is a slim chance of not reaching our complete funding goal of $30,000, but we have plans in place to combat this alternate reality:
We have different forms of marketing, that although may take longer and may not be ideal, that we can use to reach our intended audience.
We have several back-end models for the structure of our community that we can use until the funding becomes available for the right software and solutions.
We are no strangers to running our business lean, and even when we do reach our funding goal, will continue to operate in a way where our money is used in the best and most efficient manner possible.Your Next StepsWe can't make the dream of Our Elegant Minds come true without everyone getting on board. Every dollar counts and we would like to ask that you join the cause. Now is the time for action! If you find you still can’t afford to join us at $5 there are other ways you can help.

<p>My name is Kelly Ferguson, I’m a C5 Quadriplegic due to a spinal cord injury which occurred 17 years ago.  After my accident, I returned to college and graduated with a degree in Mechanical Engineering.  Using my engineering background, several years ago I designed and built a geared wheel prototype.</p>
<p>This campaign will give me the resources to produce a new pair of geared wheels for a manual wheel chair.  I will design and manufacture custom parts allowing these new wheels to be much lighter and more functional than the original prototype.</p>
<p>I currently use a manual wheelchair, however, I have difficulty pushing up steep inclines or over uneven terrain.  The geared wheels I’ve designed, which I’ve named ""Geared to Go Wheels"", will double my pushing strength.</p>
<p>These wheels will not just help me.  They will allow other wheelchair users to push further and go places which were once beyond their limits.  Geared to Go Wheels offer increased independence.  They also reduce stress on the shoulders, one of the most detrimental effects of pushing a wheelchair.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Your contributions will be used in the following categories:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>CAD Software: I will need the latest 3D drafting software in order to design and build each custom part.</li>
</ul>
<p> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.basketcasecomix.com/images/paintings/g2g/G2G_autocad-2013-logo.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>Custom Gear Train: For the original prototype, I used a commercially available speed reducer.  It was heavy and only offered a 3:1 gear ratio.  With custom, aluminum gears, I can reduce weight and get the 2:1 ratio the design requires.</li>
</ul>
<p> <img alt=""gears"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.basketcasecomix.com/images/paintings/g2g/gears.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>Materials: Aside from the custom gears, I will also need aluminum stock, pushrims, tires, bearings and all of the fasteners associated with building a wheelchair wheel. </li>
</ul>
<p> <img alt=""materials"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.basketcasecomix.com/images/paintings/g2g/G2G_materials.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li> CAD/CAM: I will utilize computer aided manufacturing to produce the various parts.  When building the first prototype, I realized the more intricate parts would require CNC fabrication to reduce costs.</li>
</ul>
<p> <img alt=""cnc"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.basketcasecomix.com/images/paintings/g2g/G2G_cnc.JPG"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>Testing: I will begin stress and road tests of the wheels with any remaining funds.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if the campaign isn’t fully funded, I still hope to be able to purchase the drafting software.  Getting the design “on paper” and having each part represented in a 3D model will streamline production.</p>
<p><strong>The Perks:</strong></p>
<p>To the right you will see the perks I’ve set up for this campaign.  Because of the unique nature of this campaign, I’ve decided to make the perks, unique, as well.  Several perks feature my own original art, as well as, prints from the comic that I draw, “Basketcase.”</p>

I currently use a manual wheelchair, however, I have difficulty pushing up steep inclines or over uneven terrain.  The geared wheels I’ve designed, which I’ve named ""Geared to Go Wheels"", will double my pushing strength.
These wheels will not just help me.  They will allow other wheelchair users to push further and go places which were once beyond their limits.  Geared to Go Wheels offer increased independence.  They also reduce stress on the shoulders, one of the most detrimental effects of pushing a wheelchair.
 
Your contributions will be used in the following categories:

CAD Software: I will need the latest 3D drafting software in order to design and build each custom part.

 

Custom Gear Train: For the original prototype, I used a commercially available speed reducer.  It was heavy and only offered a 3:1 gear ratio.  With custom, aluminum gears, I can reduce weight and get the 2:1 ratio the design requires.

 

Materials: Aside from the custom gears, I will also need aluminum stock, pushrims, tires, bearings and all of the fasteners associated with building a wheelchair wheel. 

 

 CAD/CAM: I will utilize computer aided manufacturing to produce the various parts.  When building the first prototype, I realized the more intricate parts would require CNC fabrication to reduce costs.

 

Testing: I will begin stress and road tests of the wheels with any remaining funds.

Even if the campaign isn’t fully funded, I still hope to be able to purchase the drafting software.  Getting the design “on paper” and having each part represented in a 3D model will streamline production.
The Perks:
To the right you will see the perks I’ve set up for this campaign.  Because of the unique nature of this campaign, I’ve decided to make the perks, unique, as well.  Several perks feature my own original art, as well as, prints from the comic that I draw, “Basketcase.”
 
1st Gear Contributor:  Anyone who makes a donation of any kind will get their name on the “Thank You"" section of the Geared to Go website.
 
2nd Gear Contributor:  ($20) Receive a A G2G refrigerator magnet, Your name in the ""Thank You"" section of the Geared to Go website & a thank you card.
 
3rd Gear Contributor: ($40) This will get you a hand signed copy of one of my cartoons printed on poster-board, plus everything in the 2nd Gear level.  You can choose between these four cartoons:
 
 4th Gear Contributor: ($100)  Contribute this amount and you will get a snazzy Geared to Go mug plus everything in the 3rd Gear level--including all four cartoons.
 
Revolutionary Contributor: ($250) Receive a 14""x14"" print on canvas, of my ""Che Scan Code"" Op-Art piece, plus everything in the 4th Gear Level.
 
Spaghettio Contributor: ($250) Receive a 12""x16"" print on canvas of ""Uh-Oh, Spaghettios!""  Plus everything in the 4th Gear Level.
 
Abstract Contributor: ($350) Receive a 10""x10"" original abstract painting.  Painted by yours truly with acrylic on canvas. Plus everything in the 4th Gear Level.  The painting will be similar this:
 
Abstract Contributor II: ($500) Receive a 12""x12"" original abstract painting.  Painted by yours truly with acrylic on canvas. Plus everything in the 4th Gear Level.  The painting will be similar this:
 
Corporate Contributor: ($2500)  Contribute at this level and I will place a sticker featuring your company logo, website address, etc prominently on each G2G prototype wheel.  Your company logo will also be featured on the G2G website, with links to your website, as well.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><span>JOBS IN OUR TOWN (WE MADE IT!!<em><strong> - </strong></em><strong>PLEASE</strong> see ""updates"")</span></h3>
<p>Our video may come across as light-hearted, but we wouldn’t <em>be</em> here if we weren’t stone serious. We’ve spent eighteen months getting to this point.</p>
<p><span>Twelve of us [a pastor, homemaker, two students, two retirees, two graphic artists, a writer, a school administrator, a housing director, and even our retired City Manager] from </span><span>Lompoc</span><span>, </span><span>CA</span><span> decided last year that 15% unemployment in our town was simply unacceptable.</span></p>
<p><span>We saw empty stores and homes, increased gang violence and our library was closing more and more hours. Our children’s future, which once seemed secure, was slipping away. </span></p>
<p><span>We couldn’t sit still any longer complaining about politicians and Wall Street while we waited for rich out-of-town entrepreneurs to plop down factories here. Sitting and waiting and complaining was getting us nowhere. But what to do?</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h3><span>SO WE STUDIED</span></h3>
<p>We learned that 2012 is the United Nations Year of the Cooperative for their successes in the Third World. We learned about Mondragon in Spain, and Evergreen Cooperatives in Cleveland. We learned about Arizmendi Bakeries and WAGES, both right here in California. We learned that <strong>we ourselves</strong> can plant worker-owner <strong>cooperatives </strong>with sustainable jobs that won’t leave town the next time the stock market burps. And they won't depend on government subsidies either.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>WE FOUND EXPERTS </h3>
<p><span>So, we got the </span><span>California </span><span>Center</span><span> for Cooperatives in </span><span>Davis</span><span>, </span><span>CA</span><span> to come here and help us. Now we foresee a string of co-ops, one after another, all financed from the same revolving loan fund called an “incubator.” Our first business will be a green cleaning company. We hope to hire in September. Another start-up will come in 2013.  We’ve set the spark of a tiny flicker of hope. Maybe that’s why our video seems so boisterous. </span></p>
<p><span>To be honest, we still need your help. While we were crunching the numbers on a feasibility study and a business plan we staged three fundraising events and we’ve received three small foundation grants, but we still need to raise $7,500 (or more if we can get it) just to cover the bare bones of training and materials for the start-up.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<h3><span>THAT'S WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP</span></h3>
<p><span>This is the most unorthodox, the most audacious campaign to underwrite a Lompoc business since farmers started the co-op bean warehouse in the 1800's. </span></p>
<p><span>In exchange for your contributions we're offering perks. A local artist has welded a sculpture of Rosie the Riveter’s biceps. Remember her from World War II?  Her slogan was “We can do it.” She is on the right at the bottom of the list of perks. Her slogan is our slogan.</span></p>
<p><span>To be clear, your assistance is not an investment; no amount of outside money can buy a piece of the co-ops we develop. They are <strong>staying</strong> <strong>here!</strong></span></p>
<p><span>But your gift will help hire people in </span><span>Lompoc</span><span> who want to work, and it will create real hope for the co-ops to follow.  And maybe this co-op cluster concept can be used in <strong>your</strong> town. </span></p>

<h3>RED's Custom Jewelry official launch 2015 <br/>
</h3>
<p>So, 2015 is the launch year for my up and coming jewelry business. The planning period is over and I have drafted an exhaustive business plan to include a summer full of events and festivals, setting up sales displays in a growing number of retail locations and tapping into internet market places with my own website - <a href=""http://www.redscustomjewelry.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.redscustomjewelry.com</a> - to help organize custom
orders and act as a platform to promote business. With personal appearances at live festivals and events as well as retail exposure, I hope to streamline custom production with a circular approach beginning and ending with internet orders.</p>
<p>I hope that you can come out to see me at one of the events where I will be showcasing my work this summer. The full event schedule will ultimately be available at <a href=""http://www.redscustomjewelry.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">REDsCustomJewelry.com</a>, but here is a sample of some of the places I will be in the next month or so!</p>

<br/>
<h3>What the money I am raising goes towards<br/>
</h3>
<p>I have an enviable inventory and decades of experience, so money raised is not going to purchase materials or cover the cost of learning the trade. This June, I will also be graduating from the CIC craftsman crash-course MBA, so I am also not raising the funds to learn to run a business. <br/></p>
<p>The significant start-up costs that I am seeking benefactors for are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Professional photographs</b>. I am thankful to friends (and my phone) for the pictures you see on my campaign. But eventually, professional photographs of my jewelry will be a must. </li>
<li>
<b>Event vendor fees</b>. Setting up at a show can cost anywhere from $100 to 
$1000 apiece, including registration, set-up, liability insurance, and 
travel. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Safe, interactive website</b>. I have already begun the process of designing my website with a professional. But showing off my work and creating a safe transaction environment is a large undertaking. <br/>
</li>
</ul>

I've been making jewelry since I was a kid. And the last three decades have led to my own style of jewelry-making that I am proud to be sharing with you and the world. Without a doubt, my most popular item is the sterling silver wire-wrapped ring. A great gift, a bit of fun or a touch of class for every day, and all totally custom-designed to your own personal taste.But for the more discerning customer, a sterling silver necklace is what I recommend. Pick something to accentuate the lovely hues of your bright and beautiful eyes. Why stop there? That outfit that makes you look like a million bucks will up the ante with a sterling silver bracelet to match. But don't keep all the jewelry fun to yourself! A jewelry party is the best way to spend an afternoon with friends. I'll travel to your home - or other place of your choosing - and craft a sterling silver ring custom-made to the wishes and desires of each and every one of six of your friends. Plus, a fun and educational workshop on the craft of wire-wrapping.

<h2>Why Are We Called Dollaractif?</h2> <p>Well, because that's our philosophy. Life is expensive, you need dollars to do just about anything, including living a healthy lifestyle. We believe that your hard earned dollars should do more than get you the basic necessities and some treats from time to time - they should help you thrive as an active and healthy person every single day. </p>
<p>Oh, and if you're wondering why Dollaractif is spelled with an ""f"", it's because we're based out of Montreal, Quebec (Canada), which means we're French. But don't worry, the site is going to launch fully bilingual!<br/></p>
<p>We are a passionate team of communications experts, graphic designers, programmers, kinesiologists, nutritionists, and project managers that want to help small and medium sized businesses grow beyond their daily limits and in doing so, get our community moving and eating healthy again by saving money on anything that leads to better lifestyle choices. </p>
<p></p>
<h2>How Are We Doing This?</h2>
<p>We're building a full scale e-commerce site that's focused on promoting health, and not just shopping. In a nutshell, our site is divided into three sections: General Consumption, Physical Activity, and Healthy Eating. Anytime you buy something you need from the stores on the platform, you get 2-4% back in <i>dollaractif</i> rewards to use in the Physical Activity and Healthy Eating sections. In these two sections you will find products like sportswear, fitness equipment, gardening tools, fruit and vegetable baskets and cookbooks. We'll even have services such as consults with Registered Dietitians, personal trainers, sports lessons for children, and much more. There are no complicated point systems or levels to reach, 1 <i>dollaractif</i> = 1 Canadian dollar. It's that simple.</p>
<p>Our vision is to break the financial barrier often associated with nutritious eating, fitness, gym memberships or athletic wear. Families and individuals should not have to choose between the things they need and the things that are good for them. </p>

It's coming on Novemeber - some of us in the Kootenays have our firewood cut, stacked and ready to keep us warm.

But that's just some of us.

I see a lot of stress, for a lot of families and mamas, some with young babies, to find the cash or supplies to get the wood they need to keep their families warm for the winter.
And that, especially in this community is totally crazy.


So here's what I want to do. 
$1300 will buy us 4 chords of the best quality wood- thats enough to give a lift to 4 families, and ease the pressure of the winter.

from forums and travel guides, even going on Google maps to see how they
look. This
should be enough right? Well, not quite...you
manage to discover only few of the hidden spots, you get to eat and drink in
nice places discovered by mistake rather than the ones printed in advance and
miss lots of other stuff.        Because
all the places out there (attractions, restaurants etc...) with thousands of good reviews on internet are usually all frequented by tourists, not locals.
A good family-owned restaurant will probably not even have a webpage,
but a local will certainly know about it!      makes your trip more enjoyable by connecting you with a local that can help you
with all your needs: from the most interesting things to visit to the best places to
eat/drink/party. They can even help with small issues that you might have; and
the awesome part is
that you will have support in real time during your stay: your local is at
your finger tips ready to give you all the information you might need (via sms, phone call or social media).The main part of the funds will cover the IT developing cost, to build the website, structure and design in order to have a great feel and interactive look when you use Tripal. 
The running costs
will include hosting, website maintenance and enhancements. 
The marketing costs
will be covered partially by the funds raised and will help us reach the target audience.

<h3><font size=""3"">Our Story</font></h3>
<font size=""3"">
</font><div>
<font size=""3"">Hi guys<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">!!</span><br/><br/>Our names are Kristin and Dannielle, and we have a company called Everyone Is Gay.  <br/><br/>Everyone is Gay is a couple of things. First, it is an <a href=""http://www.everyoneisgay.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">advice website for all</a>, with an emphasis on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) youth.  The website uses humor and honesty to support these youth, to </font><font size=""3"">dialogue with others in the LGBTQ community, </font><font size=""3""> and to simultaneously keep everyone laughing.  Second, Everyone Is Gay works to increase awareness at high school and college campuses through <a href=""http://youtu.be/JtpXpVAmbxI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">an ongoing, nationwide tour</a>.  <br/><br/>Before departing on our very first tour this past September, we were both working part-time jobs and meeting in Kristin's living room twice each week to keep up with the influx of emails, messages, phone calls, and other business-related items.  Having now returned home, we have quit our part-time jobs (GULP!) and are continuing to reach out to schools and other youth organizations.  <br/><br/>We are now working five days a week to keep things moving, and to reach as many youth as possible.</font><font size=""3""><br/><br/></font>
</div>
</div><div>
<h3><font size=""3"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</font></h3>
<p><font size=""3"">More than anything else, we need to survive and be able to pay the many bills, both for the company and for ourselves, in order to do the work that goes along with running a website and managing a nationwide tour of schools.**<br/></font></p>
<p><font size=""3""><br/></font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">We need your help to keep things running, especially through the next few crucial months of our growth. We have made it this far with your support, and we truly believe that by putting all of our energies toward these efforts we will soon be able to support ourselves while continuing to reach hundreds of thousands of youth worldwide.</font></p>
<p><font size=""3""><br/></font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">We are campaigning to raise $20,000 to help us as we become a full-fledged and self-sustaining business.  We want to encourage you to give <span style=""font-style: italic;"">any</span> amount, there is NO AMOUNT TOO SMALL!  Every little bit helps and gets us that much closer to our goal!</font></p>
<p><font size=""3""><br/></font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">So, what do you get (apart from our daily advice and antics)?!  Our perks include listing your name in one of our webcasts, a compilation of original Everyone Is Gay songs by artists such as Greg Laswell, Jenny Owen Youngs, and Company of Thieves, a personal wake-up call or a 20-minute video-chat with Kristin and Dannielle, t-shirts, mugs, an awesome poster signed by all of the important people on planet earth, and dinner with Everyone Is Gay!<br/></font></p>
<p><font size=""3""><br/></font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">Why should you help us?  Well...you can contribute because you love us, or because you want to Skype with us, or because you want to give your boo the BEST HOLIDAY GIFT EVER and have her unwrap a note that says, ""Kristin and Dannielle will be calling to wake your ass up for our date tomorrow. You're welcome.""</font></p>
<p><font size=""3""><br/></font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">-----THIS JUST IN---</font></p>
<p><font size=""3"">If you're outside of the US and having trouble contributing to our campaign, we have made all of the perks available via our <a href=""http://everyoneisgay.storenvy.com/collections/49779-indie-gogo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">ONLINE STORE, you can use paypal!!</a></font></p>

</div></div>","Our Story


Hi guys!!Our names are Kristin and Dannielle, and we have a company called Everyone Is Gay.  Everyone is Gay is a couple of things. First, it is an advice website for all, with an emphasis on Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer (LGBTQ) youth.  The website uses humor and honesty to support these youth, to dialogue with others in the LGBTQ community,  and to simultaneously keep everyone laughing.  Second, Everyone Is Gay works to increase awareness at high school and college campuses through an ongoing, nationwide tour.  Before departing on our very first tour this past September, we were both working part-time jobs and meeting in Kristin's living room twice each week to keep up with the influx of emails, messages, phone calls, and other business-related items.  Having now returned home, we have quit our part-time jobs (GULP!) and are continuing to reach out to schools and other youth organizations.  We are now working five days a week to keep things moving, and to reach as many youth as possible.


What We Need & What You Get
More than anything else, we need to survive and be able to pay the many bills, both for the company and for ourselves, in order to do the work that goes along with running a website and managing a nationwide tour of schools.**

We need your help to keep things running, especially through the next few crucial months of our growth. We have made it this far with your support, and we truly believe that by putting all of our energies toward these efforts we will soon be able to support ourselves while continuing to reach hundreds of thousands of youth worldwide.

We are campaigning to raise $20,000 to help us as we become a full-fledged and self-sustaining business.  We want to encourage you to give any amount, there is NO AMOUNT TOO SMALL!  Every little bit helps and gets us that much closer to our goal!

So, what do you get (apart from our daily advice and antics)?!  Our perks include listing your name in one of our webcasts, a compilation of original Everyone Is Gay songs by artists such as Greg Laswell, Jenny Owen Youngs, and Company of Thieves, a personal wake-up call or a 20-minute video-chat with Kristin and Dannielle, t-shirts, mugs, an awesome poster signed by all of the important people on planet earth, and dinner with Everyone Is Gay!

Why should you help us?  Well...you can contribute because you love us, or because you want to Skype with us, or because you want to give your boo the BEST HOLIDAY GIFT EVER and have her unwrap a note that says, ""Kristin and Dannielle will be calling to wake your ass up for our date tomorrow. You're welcome.""

-----THIS JUST IN---
If you're outside of the US and having trouble contributing to our campaign, we have made all of the perks available via our ONLINE STORE, you can use paypal!!
-----THIS JUST OUT---

We love you guys and we are so, so excited to keep on keepin' on.

XOXO,

Kristin and Dannielle

<h3 style="""">Our Story</h3>
<p style="""">I have assembled a team of devoted, hard working volunteers from all around the world that are working to bring you a community driven marketing machine.  Participants and supporters range from 17 year-old Lars working hard in Germany and AkeemPennicooke, the 16-year old boy wonder behind Hemiogenic  to Digital Roar, infrared5, Designing Digitally,Reaction Grid.  Alex and Elliot and the other members of the Boston Unity Group are hard at work bringing up our next generation of rock stars.  You all know Danielle Olson- The vision behind Infinite unityverse -responsible for the Comic book look. Wait- I can't forget Deniz who is spending his weekend knee deep in wordpress code and helping us find developers to get the site up to par.  And Joe Burchett -of Game Developer Radio whose 80 minute interview helped me think through all that I wanted to say and find renewed energy in the community.</p>

<h3 style="""">The Impact</h3>
<p style="""">Our machine as it exists already brings thousands of developers together daily in one strong focused voice.  We're already able to get young talented indie developers the kind of visibility reserved for large companies.  We connect them with the people that they need and we work with our partners to provide them with access to tools that would usually be out of their reach.  Most importantly we teach them to be introspective about their wildest ideas and dare to dream about the possibility of them becoming a reality.  </p>
<p style="""">By gamifying Infinite Unityverse into an environment where developers can choose to purchase visibility or work and earn it as well as a magical pseudounityverse  we give developers the other half of the puzzle.  Unity engine democratized game development.  We are well on our way to doing the same for indie developers marketing their apps,games and goods.  In a world where they are superheroes they believe that they can build amazing stuff-.  That's because they can and do.  We then make sure that the whole world sees them and that they can collaborate and cooperatively get that moment to show the world what they've got and bat it out the park!</p>
<p style=""""><br/></p>
<p style="""">Imagine a 16 year old working hard in his bedroom and then able to connect with another 16 year old halfway around the world with ninja video editing skills and his friend with amazing modeling skills.  Now imagine that they are joined by another 20 year old who is a master of all things audio with a score to die for and all of them are able to work on an immersive 3D movie that the whole world is watching.  Better yet stop imagining and drop by infinite unity3D to see how far we've come on the strength and effort of volunteers and know that we will be even better when we're able to devote our time to the cause instead of being limited because of a broken template.  We're getting 40-60,000 monthly views as a rag-tag bunch of guys.  Look forward to us as a well built machine with the same fire, renewed passion and even more energy. </p>

<li>Stuck </li>
<li>Hopeless</li>
<li>Frustrated </li>
<li>Lonely</li>
</ul><p></p>The problems of today's world stem from a perceptual and belief system based on an understanding of reality as  distinct, ego-identified, independent objects separated in space from other objects. Yet science today echoes what the world's wisdom and spiritual traditions have  been saying for eons: on the deepest level of our being we are not things at all. We are patterns of vibrating energy fields enmeshed and ""entangled"" in a an infinite field of energy, a web of oneness in which every ""thing"" is interconnected. In fact, there is no such thing as a separate thing!  <br/><br/>We desperately need a new vision of who and what we really are and here is the essence of that vision: WE ARE ALL SACRED WORTHY, LUMINOUS BEINGS. WE ARE LOVE AND OUR LOVE IS FOR GIVING. <p></p><p>My mission is to share this message around the globe helping people wake up to the life-changing truth of who we are, what we are, and why we are here! With your support I can use new media to empower people to re-discover their essence and live from that knowledge, transforming relationships toward a world that works for all beings. <br/></p><p>I ask your support in helping me help people connect their hearts, minds, and bodies re-learning how to walk in sacred love, balance  and harmony with the wondrous creation in which we are gifted by grace to live and thrive. <br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><h3></h3><h3></h3><h3>FUNDING GOALS</h3><h3></h3><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I am seeking $8500.00 in total.

Here are just a few of the testimonials clients and participants in his workshops, retreats and <a href=""http://drtompinkson.com/work-with-dr-tom-pinkson/recognition-rites/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Recogntion Rites</a> have shared:</p><p></p><p>“<i>With his humility, strength and incomparable experience, Tom 
holds sacred space like none other. He makes everyone feel safe, 
welcome, and valued</i>.” – Glen, Film Maker<br/></p>
<p>“<i>One ceremony with Tom is like 10 years of psychotherapy</i>.” – Candace, College Student</p><p><i>""During the ceremony with Tom I was jolted. Can't think of another word that works here, but yeah…during the ceremony, I was jolted by the spiritual channel he opened up. Clarity. About my life. About the world at large. And this opening occurred from the medicine but also Tom's powerful calling and bringing in spirit. The drums. The chants. The intention. All of it."" </i>- Steve, Entrepreneur<br/></p>
<p><i><em>“My gratitude for Tom can’t be put into words, my entire 
world-view and perception of reality now reflects something much closer 
to truth. There isn’t a much bigger gift you could give someone, so 
thank you Tom.</em>”</i> - Ian, Business Owner<br/></p>
<p><em><i>“Tom is such a valuable presence in the world. I can’t think of 
any men I know that hold the kind of space that he holds.  His years of 
dedication from his heart in your apprenticeship with the work he does 
has created such a strong center in him.  It’s very unique and so 
needed.”</i> </em>- Isabelle, Therapist</p>
<p><i><em>“I wish I had taped that conversation with Tom. What I would give
 to sit and talk one on one with him for an hour. He really knows how to
 communicate with people.”</em></i> - Mary, Teacher<br/></p>
<p><i><em>“This couple has traveled all over the world and they have never 
met up with anyone that could convey a message that they connected with.
 Tom got thru to them….he has a way of delivering messages  that is a 
gift.  The more people Tom talks to the better our world will be…. how 
many others are there out there that don’t believe the fundamental truth
 that they are worthy and sacred at their core? Thanks for having the 
patience to get this message thru to my friends, and to others.”</em></i> - Nancy, Business Owner<br/></p>                                                        ---------------------<br/><p></p><br/><h3>A NOTE ON PERKS<br/>
</h3><br/>As you will see below, <a href=""http://drtompinkson.com/bracelet-story/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">World Love Bracelets</a> are included with every contribution. Why? Because in my work as a 
psychologist, leading groups and retreats, when it comes time for people
 to introduce themselves I invite them to share their names and then to 
say: <b>“<i>I am a sacred, worthy, luminous being. I am love and my love is for giving.” </i></b><b><br/><br/></b><p>Unfortunately many people do not believe this about themselves so this inspired me to create  <a href=""http://drtompinkson.com/bracelet-story/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">World Love Bracelets</a>
 to support people waking up to the truth of their being.  I have given 
out over 1500 of these bracelets and encourage others to do the same 
thus sending out ripples of love energy into the world field that 
desperately needs more love. Thus far, everyone who has received a World
 Love Bracelet, has ordered more for friends and family. </p><br/><p></p><h3></h3><p><b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/523954/files/20140421191653-bracelets_rainbow.jpeg?1398133013"" src="""" style=""width: 675.489px; height: 339px;""/></b></p><p></p><p>I would like to create more lifestyle products with this message such as different color and style bracelets, necklaces, totes, perhaps even sacred object home decor people can give as gifts to themselves or loved ones.<br/></p><h3></h3><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>QUESTIONS?

The problems of today's world stem from a perceptual and belief system based on an understanding of reality as  distinct, ego-identified, independent objects separated in space from other objects. Yet science today echoes what the world's wisdom and spiritual traditions have  been saying for eons: on the deepest level of our being we are not things at all. We are patterns of vibrating energy fields enmeshed and ""entangled"" in a an infinite field of energy, a web of oneness in which every ""thing"" is interconnected. In fact, there is no such thing as a separate thing!  We desperately need a new vision of who and what we really are and here is the essence of that vision: WE ARE ALL SACRED WORTHY, LUMINOUS BEINGS. WE ARE LOVE AND OUR LOVE IS FOR GIVING. My mission is to share this message around the globe helping people wake up to the life-changing truth of who we are, what we are, and why we are here! With your support I can use new media to empower people to re-discover their essence and live from that knowledge, transforming relationships toward a world that works for all beings. I ask your support in helping me help people connect their hearts, minds, and bodies re-learning how to walk in sacred love, balance  and harmony with the wondrous creation in which we are gifted by grace to live and thrive. FUNDING GOALSI am seeking $8500.00 in total. Use of funds:
Website (we have a designer lined up who has agreed to do this for a largely reduced fee) $1500
Community Outreach (marketing, PR, program development) $3,000
Video shoots and editing (1 introductory seminar video of 60 minutes, 12 fifteen-minute workshop videos, 4 two-minute inspirational videos) $2500
E-books, podcasts, webinars  $1500 
IMPLEMENTATION 
With my latest book, Fruitful Aging, I have set the tone for a series that explores new, more sacred, joyful, and sustainable visions for a myriad of aspects of living. The following domains are assets that will be used as part of this platform:

ANewVisionOfAging.com
ANewVisionOfLiving.com
ANewVisionOfWealth.com
ANewVisionOfHealing.com
ANewVisionOfWellness.com
LiveEnriched.com
SacredWorthyLuminousBeing.com
FruitfulAging.com

I will use new media to create easy access programming and outreach available to people around the world. A new website will provide a user friendly, inviting ""online home"" for folks drawn to, and interested in, learning about A New Vision of Living™.IMPACTTom has already inspired and empowered thousands of people around the world; But the times call for ever more positive change and Dr. Pinkson can help lead the way. Here are just a few of the testimonials clients and participants in his workshops, retreats and Recogntion Rites have shared:“With his humility, strength and incomparable experience, Tom 
holds sacred space like none other. He makes everyone feel safe, 
welcome, and valued.” – Glen, Film Maker
“One ceremony with Tom is like 10 years of psychotherapy.” – Candace, College Student""During the ceremony with Tom I was jolted. Can't think of another word that works here, but yeah…during the ceremony, I was jolted by the spiritual channel he opened up. Clarity. About my life. About the world at large. And this opening occurred from the medicine but also Tom's powerful calling and bringing in spirit. The drums. The chants. The intention. All of it."" - Steve, Entrepreneur
“My gratitude for Tom can’t be put into words, my entire 
world-view and perception of reality now reflects something much closer 
to truth. There isn’t a much bigger gift you could give someone, so 
thank you Tom.” - Ian, Business Owner
“Tom is such a valuable presence in the world. I can’t think of 
any men I know that hold the kind of space that he holds.  His years of 
dedication from his heart in your apprenticeship with the work he does 
has created such a strong center in him.  It’s very unique and so 
needed.” - Isabelle, Therapist
“I wish I had taped that conversation with Tom. What I would give
 to sit and talk one on one with him for an hour. He really knows how to
 communicate with people.” - Mary, Teacher
“This couple has traveled all over the world and they have never 
met up with anyone that could convey a message that they connected with.
 Tom got thru to them….he has a way of delivering messages  that is a 
gift.  The more people Tom talks to the better our world will be…. how 
many others are there out there that don’t believe the fundamental truth
 that they are worthy and sacred at their core? Thanks for having the 
patience to get this message thru to my friends, and to others.” - Nancy, Business Owner                                                        ---------------------A NOTE ON PERKS
As you will see below, World Love Bracelets are included with every contribution. Why? Because in my work as a 
psychologist, leading groups and retreats, when it comes time for people
 to introduce themselves I invite them to share their names and then to 
say: “I am a sacred, worthy, luminous being. I am love and my love is for giving.” Unfortunately many people do not believe this about themselves so this inspired me to create  World Love Bracelets
 to support people waking up to the truth of their being.  I have given 
out over 1500 of these bracelets and encourage others to do the same 
thus sending out ripples of love energy into the world field that 
desperately needs more love. Thus far, everyone who has received a World
 Love Bracelet, has ordered more for friends and family. I would like to create more lifestyle products with this message such as different color and style bracelets, necklaces, totes, perhaps even sacred object home decor people can give as gifts to themselves or loved ones.QUESTIONS?

<br/><h3>Help us raise $5,000</h3>

Source is the premier alternative heath provider in Western North Carolina for over 12 years. They have won awards for their work, and are repeatedly voted the best in business for alternative healing.
Whitney and Blake Madden, owners of Source, are involved in a long legal zoning battle.  A reversal by the town administration on their original decision to allow Source to remain in its current location on Montreat Road has caused the Maddens $16,703.98 in legal expenses thus far.  With a superior court appeal on the horizon, additional funds estimated to be another $5,000 will be required.  The Maddens have already completely exhausted their personal resources.
95% of the Town of Black Mountain wants Source to stay where it is.  Let's use our resources to help Whitney and Blake support Source For Well-Being.






Help us raise $5,000
$5,000 is a small piece of what Blake and Whitney have to pay legal fees. (Our ""indiegogo"" goal is $3500, but we're really hoping to hit $5,000. We can do it!) Their lawyer estimates total costs will be in the range of $20,000-$21,000, possibly more. This fundraiser is a good way to show that we care about Source. Look to the left to see exciting perks that you will receive as a contributor. 
Whitney and Blake will continue to spend their own money on lawyers as long as it takes to defend this precious community resource. Many of us have received powerful healing at Source. Let's say thank you. Your energy and your participation does matter. Please put your name up there TODAY!

<h3>Family Reunion in Ethiopia</h3>
<p>I
 am a friend of Michele's who has been following along with her and Maia's 
adventures on Facebook.  Many of us are excited for their upcoming family reunion in 
Ethiopia.  I thought we could make this trip a little financially easier
 on Michele.  This is just one way we want to remind her that she's not in 
this alone and has lots of loving supporters here for her.<br/></p>
<p><span>If
 you are able to and are so inspired, please consider a small donation!  Any funds raised will pay off airfare, travel expenses 
and generally facilitate a reunion of Maia with her biological 
grandmother and sister in the country of her birth. If we exceed our 
fundraising goal of $1000, extra monies will go to the nannies who cared
 for Maia at Layla House-- they are starting a cafe business after 
having lost their jobs.  Michele and Maia also sponsor a young Ethiopian girl and 
extra funds would go toward her schooling as well. </span></p>
<p><b>The Beginning of the Reunion Story</b></p>
<p>As
 you may know, Maia's sister, Bezawit, was adopted at age four by a 
family in the Netherlands.  As she learned to speak Dutch, she began to 
tell her parents about a little sister she had in Ethiopia.  With 
careful consideration, her parents sought out more information and were 
able to find Bezawit's little sister, Maia, living with her mom, 
Michele, here in Ann Arbor.  Having had no knowledge of Maia's Ethiopian
 family's existence, Michele and Maia learned that Maia's birth mother 
had died from a hemorrhage when Maia was a newborn infant.  Her 
grandmother worked nights at a factory to try to support Maia and her 
sister.  She came to the realization that she could not provide for 
their safety and well being in the way she knew they needed.  Maia lived at Layla House and Bezawit at another orphanage until they were adopted into their 
families.  They were reunited this past Spring in Chicago.  Maia fell 
instantly in love with her big sister and Bezawit reclaimed the sister 
she had held as a very young girl.  This trip to Ethiopia will allow for
 Maia and her grandmother and sister to be reunited, surrounded in love 
by their expanded international family.<br/></p>

</div>","Who We Are
On Nursing Excellence, Inc. (ONE) a 501(c)3 non-profit
organization was founded in 2009 to expand the effectiveness, efficiency, well
being and recognition of the healthcare workforce. ONE is the umbrella
organization for the Institute for Staffing Excellence and Innovation,
providing information to assist organizations in achieving excellence in
staffing and realizing the quality, safety, financial, operational and cultural
outcomes that result when excellence is achieved. This organization is led by a
group of mission-driven nurse leaders who volunteer their time to promote and
further the work of nursing.  Our Board includes: Rhonda Anderson, RN,
DNSc, FAAN, FACHE (Chairperson), Karlene Kerfoot, PhD, RN, NEA-BC, FAAN
(Vice-Chairperson), Karen K. Kirby, RN, MSN, NEA-BC, FACHE (Treasurer), Suellyn
Ellerbe RN, MN, NEA-BC (Secretary), Carol Ann Cavouras, MS, RN, CNAA, Donna
Nickitas, PhD, RN, NEA-BC, CNE, FAAN and Ann Van Slyck, RN, MSN, CNAA, FAAN. 
Our Goal
As a non-profit organization, we are dependent upon generous
support from both corporate sponsorship and individual donations to further our
work. Each year we raise funds to support the operational costs of the
organization and bring large projects to the nursing community in support of
our mission to generate innovations in the nursing workforce.  Our 2014
goal is to raise $100,000 in sponsorships and donations from both corporations
and individuals toward project support. 
Project Support
Among the projects for 2014 are two large initiatives that your
generous contribution will directly support.
Excellence and Evidence in Staffing  - Learn more about this project here.  The Institute for

inspirational project through video shorts - our program called Stories Worth Sharing -  as we believe it is vital
that nurses everywhere are reminded of the amazing work that they do every

<p>We are Hitesh and Catalina who love to travel and everything related to it. We traveled across India and realized that there are not enough places/centers/hubs that cater to a traveler's need: their need to be heard; to share their stories &amp; experiences; to sit, relax, read, and eat when they are on the road. The café will also promote the native culture of India and encourage travelers to promote their own cultures. We are going to open this travel café in the heart of the mountains, in Rishikesh, Uttarakhand which is surrounded by the mountains and the river Ganga. <br/><br/>This campaign is an effort to raise just enough money to set up the café. Your small contributions will help us making this dream a reality because we believe that a travel café is the need of all the travelers.

The Alameda Kitchen will transform fruits and vegetables that would otherwise be wasted into nutritious, affordable food products and meals for low-income populations.

<p>The Alameda Kitchen will sell food products made from fresh fruits and vegetables from farms, distributors, and grocery stores that don’t meet strict cosmetic standards. In partnership with local chefs, we will design and sell premium products to local businesses, which will allow us to subsidize products at low costs for agencies that serve food insecure populations, including senior centers, after-school programs, and homeless shelters.</p>

<p><b>In Food Shift’s history</b>, we have recovered 100,000 lbs of food from farms, grocery stores, events, and more. Food Shift received 5,000 pounds of perfectly good food that wouldn’t have made it to the grocery store in September 2015 alone, most of which was donated by our friends at Imperfect. In a 3 month period Food Shift helped keep 45,000 lbs of food out of the waste stream from Andronico's Community Markets. In one day, Food Shift recovered an entire pallet of peaches from an Oakland produce distributor - totaling 1600 lbs! All of this high-quality food is the type of food we will be bringing into the kitchen to process. We’re also in the process of creating new relationships with farms, distributors, and stores who want their food to benefit the community.</p>

</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Over the past year Food Shift has learned that there are multiple challenges APC residents face, including difficulty accessing food, health issues, financial instability, and isolation.  99% of APC residents have incomes below the poverty line and as a result the majority of residents use the food bank and/or depend on low cost foods. <b>Only 10-15% of the APC population is employed. </b>Many residents feel isolated from the broader community and stuck in their socioeconomic position. </p>
<br/><p>Food Shift cares deeply about ending the cycle of poverty and hunger and we know that food alone won’t solve hunger.  APC residents want to get back to work, and the kitchen will provide hands-on-experience and support to make it possible.</p>

<h1 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Food Shift's Previous Work</u></h1>
<p></p>
<p>Food Shift has established itself as a key educator, innovator, and leader within the movement toward a more sustainable use of food. Food Shift has built strong cross-sector relationships, co-hosted a 300 person national conference to discuss solutions to wasted food, and implemented innovative solutions to tackle wasted food and hunger.  We have conducted research, launched campaigns, and designed food recovery, waste tracking, and redistribution programs for schools, grocery stores, technology companies, major events, and county governments.  We have a deep understanding of the challenges, opportunities, and players within the complex ecosystem around food production, food waste, and food access.  </p>
<br/><p>Food Shift’s key accomplishments include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Designed and implemented a food donation <a href=""http://foodshift.net/blog/14000-pounds-food-distributed-oakland-families-food-shifts-ousd-program/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">program</a> with 13 Oakland schools that redistributed 14,000 pounds of food to students, families, and community agencies. Food Shift is currently developing an implementation guide to expand the program.</p></li>
<li><p>Launched two public transit ad campaigns in<a href=""http://foodshift.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/bart-collage.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> 2013</a> and <a href=""http://foodshift.net/ourstories/food-shift-public-transit-ads-shift-minds-food-waste/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">2014</a> to raise awareness of wasted food and hunger. The ads were seen by millions and <a href=""http://foodshift.net/ourstories/food-shift-public-transit-ads-shift-minds-food-waste/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">67%</a> of those surveyed said they would be less likely to waste food as a result of seeing the ad.</p></li>
<li><p>Co-hosted and planned the<a href=""http://foodshift.net/events/gleaned-foraged-recovered-food-zero-food-waste-forum/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Zero Food Waste Forum conference</a> and<a href=""http://foodshift.net/ourstories/feeding-5000-edible-nutritious-delicious-fun-solution/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Feeding the 5000</a> to discuss solutions to wasted food, to spark national collaboration, and to build movement momentum.</p></li>
<li><p>Set up and managed a food donation and waste tracking <a href=""http://foodshift.net/ourstories/andronicos-program-surpasses-expectations-10000-pounds-recovered-27000-saved/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">program</a> for Andronico’s Community Markets that recovered almost 50,000 pounds of food in 3 months, saved the store $27,000 in reduced waste disposal costs, and increased the reported happiness level of 87% of store staff.</p></li>
<li><p>Hired by the Santa Clara County to conduct a <a href=""http://foodshift.net/blog/this-just-in-findings-from-food-shifts-santa-clara-county-research/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">study</a> on barriers and opportunities surrounding food recovery, and make recommendations for county-wide action to improve food recovery.

The Alameda Kitchen will transform fruits and vegetables that would otherwise be wasted into nutritious, affordable food products and meals for low-income populations.

Food Shift works collaboratively with communities, businesses and governments to develop sustainable solutions that reduce wasted food and hunger. In our quest to solve these challenges we’ve learned that the community needs a kitchen facility to process the abundance of surplus food. A kitchen facility will also allow for the creation of affordable food products that can generate revenue for more food recovery while increasing access to nutrition.  This leads us to the Alameda Kitchen. The Alameda Kitchen will transform fruits and vegetables that would otherwise be wasted into nutritious, affordable food products and meals for low-income populations. Food Shift will be utilizing the kitchen at Alameda Point Collaborative (APC) - a housing community for formerly homeless individuals and families - and provide job training to their residents.  The revenue generated will help us pay fair wages to these workers and allow us to expand our program to reduce waste and increase access to affordable healthy food.

We have the kitchen, the food, and the people to make this vision a reality. What we need now is your support!

How It Works
By rescuing surplus food and bringing it into the kitchen we can transform slightly bruised apples into applesauce for seniors, overripe bananas into muffins for school children, or misshapen veggies into an affordable Food Shift soup! 

This is the magic of the Alameda Kitchen.





The Alameda Kitchen will sell food products made from fresh fruits and vegetables from farms, distributors, and grocery stores that don’t meet strict cosmetic standards. In partnership with local chefs, we will design and sell premium products to local businesses, which will allow us to subsidize products at low costs for agencies that serve food insecure populations, including senior centers, after-school programs, and homeless shelters.


                 

In Food Shift’s history, we have recovered 100,000 lbs of food from farms, grocery stores, events, and more. Food Shift received 5,000 pounds of perfectly good food that wouldn’t have made it to the grocery store in September 2015 alone, most of which was donated by our friends at Imperfect. In a 3 month period Food Shift helped keep 45,000 lbs of food out of the waste stream from Andronico's Community Markets. In one day, Food Shift recovered an entire pallet of peaches from an Oakland produce distributor - totaling 1600 lbs! All of this high-quality food is the type of food we will be bringing into the kitchen to process. We’re also in the process of creating new relationships with farms, distributors, and stores who want their food to benefit the community.




Why Jobs? 


Over the past year Food Shift has learned that there are multiple challenges APC residents face, including difficulty accessing food, health issues, financial instability, and isolation.  99% of APC residents have incomes below the poverty line and as a result the majority of residents use the food bank and/or depend on low cost foods. Only 10-15% of the APC population is employed. Many residents feel isolated from the broader community and stuck in their socioeconomic position. 
Food Shift cares deeply about ending the cycle of poverty and hunger and we know that food alone won’t solve hunger.  APC residents want to get back to work, and the kitchen will provide hands-on-experience and support to make it possible.

Food Shift's Previous Work

Food Shift has established itself as a key educator, innovator, and leader within the movement toward a more sustainable use of food. Food Shift has built strong cross-sector relationships, co-hosted a 300 person national conference to discuss solutions to wasted food, and implemented innovative solutions to tackle wasted food and hunger.  We have conducted research, launched campaigns, and designed food recovery, waste tracking, and redistribution programs for schools, grocery stores, technology companies, major events, and county governments.  We have a deep understanding of the challenges, opportunities, and players within the complex ecosystem around food production, food waste, and food access.  
Food Shift’s key accomplishments include:

Designed and implemented a food donation program with 13 Oakland schools that redistributed 14,000 pounds of food to students, families, and community agencies. Food Shift is currently developing an implementation guide to expand the program.
Launched two public transit ad campaigns in 2013 and 2014 to raise awareness of wasted food and hunger. The ads were seen by millions and 67% of those surveyed said they would be less likely to waste food as a result of seeing the ad.
Co-hosted and planned the Zero Food Waste Forum conference and Feeding the 5000 to discuss solutions to wasted food, to spark national collaboration, and to build movement momentum.
Set up and managed a food donation and waste tracking program for Andronico’s Community Markets that recovered almost 50,000 pounds of food in 3 months, saved the store $27,000 in reduced waste disposal costs, and increased the reported happiness level of 87% of store staff.
Hired by the Santa Clara County to conduct a study on barriers and opportunities surrounding food recovery, and make recommendations for county-wide action to improve food recovery. Food Shift will serve as an adviser to Santa Clara County in the upcoming months to assist them in implementing the suggested steps of action.





Food Recovered from Imperfect - this is the kind of produce we'll be using in the Alameda Kitchen!

The Food Shift Team

Food Shift is a scrappy, organized, passionate, and focused team. We aim to radically shift the system from tossing away good food to using wholesome food to feed people and provide good jobs. Our mission is to develop innovative models that address the structural causes of wasted food and hunger and to develop a more effective and sustainable system for food recovery and redistribution.
Food Shift has 3 full-time paid staff and a core team of 12 volunteers who contribute 5-10 hours/week. Last year, our volunteers contributed over 10,000 hours of work for Food Shift! Our team is dedicated to spending our money wisely and putting every dollar to good use.



       

Dana Frasz, Founder & Director

Dana is a fearless, collaborative, and determined innovator with over a decade of food recovery and entrepreneurship experience. In college Dana launched an award-winning food recovery program while at Sarah Lawrence College in New York. She then spent the next three years working at Ashoka.  Applying her knowledge of social innovation and systems change to the food waste crisis, Food Shift has developed a national network and become a key influencer within the movement. This year, Dana was selected as an honoree for the inaugural Mic50, which recognizes “the next generation of leaders, innovators, and cultural influencers.” 




Hanna Morris, Program Coordinator

Hanna has worked as the Program Coordinator at Food Shift for over the past year and has extensive background in zero waste, food waste prevention, and working with at-risk populations. At Food Shift, she helped set up a food recovery and waste tracking program for a local grocery store chain; planned a meal of all recovered and foraged food for attendees at a food waste awareness conference; and produced a report on food recovery for Santa Clara County.  
Megan Mubaraki, Outreach and Development Coordinator
Megan joined the Food Shift team in July 2015 as the Outreach and Development Coordinator, and has a background in sociology, agroecology, and food justice at UC Berkeley.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>At the heart of great music cities, is a great record store. We have the knowledge, abilities, passion, and time to make this happen. The only thing we're missing is the funds. And that's where you guys come in! By having a place to buy new releases as they are released, Savannah can stay current on new music throughout the year. By opening a record store, we will have direct connections to the record labels, bands, and managers that schedule tours. With our connection and Savannah showing its interest and support a band by buying their music, they will have a reason to stop here on tour, which means MORE SHOWS IN SAVANNAH!!!</p>

<p>As a pastor (The Shepherd's Fellowship) in the area, I have seen the great work that the Marion Shelter Program does for those in our community. Like many in our area, a new awareness of the financial struggle of this service arose with the recent news of additional cuts being made to make ends meet.</p>
<p>After meeting with some of the leadership of the program, I walked away excited and impressed about the long-term plans that are being laid out to move forward as an agency and meet the financial needs. However, it is on my heart to find an answer to the nagging question that many are thinking at his time, ""What can the community come together and do to help during this time?""</p>
<p>So, with this in mind, I have put together this effort to invite you to join us in helping with the immediate needs by donating to this cause where all funds raised will be to the Marion Shelter Program.</p>
<p><strong>What will the money go towards...</strong></p>
<p>While I know all too well that people like you and I like to go to some particular project or vision... the cold, hard fact is this..... the Marion Shelter Program needs cash to prevent further cuts. It's not glamorous but it's reality.</p>
<p>In talking to the leadership, the reserve funds have boiled down to only $2800 after the last few years that have hit everyone so hard. It is my goal, with your help, is to at least double that. Will you be part of that solution?</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Will you help me get the word out? After you make your donation, will you consider sharing this campaign with others through email, Facebook, Twitter and the like? <br/><br/>Will you talk to your pastor to see if your church will take a special collection and add it into this campaign? <br/><br/>Will you be creative and come up with some ideas to raise some funds at your work place or with others to donate?</p>
<p>The goal is only $2800 but I would love to see our community rally and blow this goal out! What an opportunity to encourage those who serve our community and those in need!</p>
<p>Blessings!</p>
<p>(For those looking for your gift to be tax deductable, it will not be through this campaign. This is simply an effort for good people to do something good for the community. If you would like to donate and get a tax deduction, please contact the Marion Shelter Program direct.)</p>

<h3>Corporate Social Responsibility</h3>
<p>What if you knew that your local grocery store helped support life-saving disease research programs? Or that the money you spend at the coffee shop around the corner went to developing third-world countries? Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is becoming part of many companies' mission. We believe both big brands and small businesses can contribute to important social causes - while still earning a profit - and inspire social action and philantropy in consumers.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Truismo lets you find more responsible businesses and learn more about how they support nonprofits. Check in, leave tips, share with your friends, and earn points and badges that show the causes YOU care about. And if you already use apps like Foursquare and Facebook Places, you can still earn points and rewards on Truismo!</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>There’s alot of noise out there about corporate responsibility, and sometimes its hard to distinguish all the blogs, PR, and “greenwashing” from actual reality. Most CSR indexes today measure sustainability, employee relations, and environmental impact. There's no common standard rating system, each industry is different, and small businesses are always looked over. Truismo breaks it down and shows you how businesses support nonprofits YOU care about.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Solution</h3>
<p></p>

<h3>What We Are Asking</h3>
<p>We are currently in the design/mockup phase. We will be using the $7000 as startup costs to fund development -- which includes wireframing, design, and technical build. Funding will allow us to complete the prototype and begin work on a full beta release by Dec 2011. About 25% of the funds will also go towards the CSR/market research and data collection needed to build the Truismo database of businesses and their nonprofit partners which will initially populate the app, aka the Truismo Index Project.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Best Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>1. PLEDGE! Even a minimum $5 pledge will push us to the top of the site and increase our backers.</p>
<p>2. SHARE! Tweet us, post us on Facebook, Google+ us, share us with all your friends! It takes only a minute but makes all the difference in the world.<br/></p>
<p>3. COMMENT! This is our first campaign and we could use your feedback, constructive criticism or praise.</p>

</div></div>","Corporate Social Responsibility
What if you knew that your local grocery store helped support life-saving disease research programs? Or that the money you spend at the coffee shop around the corner went to developing third-world countries? Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is becoming part of many companies' mission. We believe both big brands and small businesses can contribute to important social causes - while still earning a profit - and inspire social action and philantropy in consumers.

Truismo lets you find more responsible businesses and learn more about how they support nonprofits. Check in, leave tips, share with your friends, and earn points and badges that show the causes YOU care about. And if you already use apps like Foursquare and Facebook Places, you can still earn points and rewards on Truismo!


The Problem
There’s alot of noise out there about corporate responsibility, and sometimes its hard to distinguish all the blogs, PR, and “greenwashing” from actual reality. Most CSR indexes today measure sustainability, employee relations, and environmental impact. There's no common standard rating system, each industry is different, and small businesses are always looked over. Truismo breaks it down and shows you how businesses support nonprofits YOU care about.


The Solution

With Truismo, you can find socially good businesses, check in, leave tips, share with your friends, and best of all -- participate in challenges sponsored by big brands and turn your points into DONATIONS to charities! That's social networking for a good cause.



Truismo will also recommend places based on your interests. Got a passion for animals? You’ll be notified of places around you that support animal rescue and protection nonprofits. The more you check-in and share with your friends, the more points you earn, and you can get AMBASSADOR status -- giving you access to perks like tickets to Truismo-sponsored charity events and happy hours! Check out www.truismo.com to learn about all these great features.

<div><br/></div>
<div>My name is Rob Busch and I am a business consultant located in Jacksonville, Florida.  My partner Robert Manghir is the owner and inventor of unique fishing product called ""The Fishing Tapper.""  This patented product is being re-launched on a larger scale and we need your help in funding this venture!</div>
<div>Robert developed this product to address and solve some of the frustrations that anglers have when fishing in heavy top grass or with logs and other debris in the water....you know, those structures that fish love to lurk around. </div>
<div>The Fishing Tapper  allows the angler to fish with a wide variety of baits, both live and artificial by adjusting the arc of the Leader or the height of the Bobber.  The angler has the option of ""Top Water Fishing"" i.e.being able to adjust the bait to be slightly ""Above Water,"" and tap the bait down to simulate an insect landing on top of the water.  A simple touch of your line will cause a dipping action onto the water. The Fishing Tapper holds the bait and hook out of the debris and won't tangle. When the fish hit the baited hook end, the Fishing Tapper will turn into a steel Leader that will literally allow you to pull the fish over logs or other debris!  </div>
<div>Check out the video to see this lure in action!!!</div> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What We Need </h3> <p>We need to raise $100,000 to re-launch this project into the marketplace.  There was an initial launch back in 2012 that was done through Trade Shows and Swap Events.  Though there was some initial success, we knew we needed a broader platform to launch our distribution.   We need to rebuild the website, begin larger production capability and print our marketing &amp; advertising collateral.  We will first establish our distribution regionally and then look to a national marketing campaign via infomercial or one of the cable TV shopping channels.  The more money we raise the faster we can get this product out to the rest of the fishermen across the country to enjoy!  We are developing a full business plan to market this product on a national basis as well as working on multiple retail distribution markets.</p>
<p>Specific allocation for initial funding:</p> <ul>
<li>Improved Website to handle large traffic, order processing and payments</li>

<li>Improved Marketing Materials and Packaging</li>

<h3>What You Get</h3>
<div>We will send you 1 Fishing Tapper for your generous donation of $10.  We will send you a Children's Tapper for $15.  For every $25 minimum donation we will send you out a packet of 5 Fishing Tappers!  For $100 and up we will send you a packet of 25 Fishing Tappers!  We want you to be able to enjoy the Fishing Tapper for yourself and to give them out to your friends and family!!!  We are looking for other potential partners or licensees to help us distribute this product across the world!</div>
</div>
</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Wider Market</h3> <p>We see an immediate opportunity to distribute to many parts of the world where fishing is necessary for daily food and survival.  We already have built in distribution for the Philippines and the Dominican Republic and we will test those markets for first as launch to other parts of the world.</p>
<p>Larger applications are being developed for larger catches such as Alligator Fishing and Ocean Fishing.  We have all seen how the guys on SWAMP PEOPLE catch those alligators in the deep swamp areas of Louisiana.  We plan to introduce these variations to our patented product a little bit down the road.</p>
<p>Kids love the ""Triple Tapper"" because they are easily entertained by watching the fish strike simultaneously and the fun of catching multiple fish.  And parents...wouldn't you love spending more time fishing and less time untangling lines?  This product is so simple to use you can teach your children quickly on how to use it, and watch them enjoy catching multiple fish at a time!<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Unfortunately we have had a few people that were working with us try to steal the design and the products for themselves.  We can assure you that the patent of this design is completely locked down and is 100% owned by the inventor Robert Manghir.  Our attorneys have assured us that they are capable of handling any further attempts to infringe upon any of our intellectual property, including patents, trademarks or copyrights.  With your help, we look forward to be able to ""re-launch"" this game changing technology successfully into the marketplace!</p>

The Wider Market We see an immediate opportunity to distribute to many parts of the world where fishing is necessary for daily food and survival.  We already have built in distribution for the Philippines and the Dominican Republic and we will test those markets for first as launch to other parts of the world.
Larger applications are being developed for larger catches such as Alligator Fishing and Ocean Fishing.  We have all seen how the guys on SWAMP PEOPLE catch those alligators in the deep swamp areas of Louisiana.  We plan to introduce these variations to our patented product a little bit down the road.
Kids love the ""Triple Tapper"" because they are easily entertained by watching the fish strike simultaneously and the fun of catching multiple fish.  And parents...wouldn't you love spending more time fishing and less time untangling lines?  This product is so simple to use you can teach your children quickly on how to use it, and watch them enjoy catching multiple fish at a time!
  
Risks & Challenges Unfortunately we have had a few people that were working with us try to steal the design and the products for themselves.  We can assure you that the patent of this design is completely locked down and is 100% owned by the inventor Robert Manghir.  Our attorneys have assured us that they are capable of handling any further attempts to infringe upon any of our intellectual property, including patents, trademarks or copyrights.  With your help, we look forward to be able to ""re-launch"" this game changing technology successfully into the marketplace!

<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Excellence is a very small company composed of ambitious young entrepreneurs who just need to reach a comfort zone so we may focus on the bigger picture. With a safety net available we'll be able further devote our time to developing an enthusiastic capable staff, growing our client base, and establishing our presence in our area.</p>
<p>For three years my team and I have dedicated ourselves to mastering the craft of professional cleaning, as well as the nuances of running a business. To be completely honest, we've made many mistakes in the past, and its likely we will make more. But, one thing for sure is that we always learn from our mistakes and always do our best to correct and prevent them. The last three years have been the greatest learning experience of our lives. We are only a matter of steps away from transforming our dream of a self-sustainable enterprise, that values and respects its customers and staff, to a reality. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>Short Term Vision</h3>
<div>Right now, Excellence is still combating financial stability when the unexpected occurs. Over the 6 months we will be working towards saving enough to handle the worst case scenario. Additionally, we will focus on building a large enough client base to always supplement the monthly bottom line. Along with increasing our client base we will also have hire and train more staff members.</div>
<h3>Long Term Vision</h3>
We have a seemingly unlimited supply of ideas for down the road. We've discussed selling household goods to residential customers, creating a storefront to sell premium cleaning products, and even manufacturing our own cleaning products. We would love to explore such ideas later on, but our most definite long term goal is to streamline every aspect of our current operation and open another branch. Since we first created this company we have envisioned a fleet of cleaning crews servicing dozens of customers in multiple cities everyday. We have an incredibly long way to go before that dream will be realized. However, perfecting this branch is the first step.</div><div>                                      <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1202285/files/20150206143610-MopBroom.Page_Breaks._2015.png?1423262170"" src="""" style=""width: 366.105263157895px; height: 148px; text-align: center;""/><br/>

<p> I'm Ian. </p>
<p>Just a regular guy from Down Under Australia. I'm 51 years old and married with four grown children and several grandchildren as well. I've launched my campaign for two reasons. One, I have a genuine desire to help others in their quest of a successful campaign and two, I believe in good karma, so by helping you I believe it will help me to fulfill a life time dream to own my own boat.  Although I've worked hard for the past 30 years things haven't always gone my way and I don't ever see me having enough money to realise my dream of owning a nice boat. That's where my campaign comes into play. I've come up with an idea to help raise those funds and to help others at the same time.</p>
<p>I have noticed when using Indiegogo that it is hard to view a lot of campaigns quickly and easily and that I'm sure there are plenty that go unnoticed. So my idea is to get as many as possible onto the one page, that's where my site comes into play. Please check it out at <a href=""http://www.milliondollarboatpage.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Million Dollar Boat Page</a>.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul>
<li>I've always dreamed of owning a nice boat. One big enough to take my family out onto the waterways and explore the Queensland Coast and Great Barrier Reef.  Of course, to be able to do that, the boat needs to be quite large and large boats don't come cheap. </li> <li>Of course I don't expect people to just give me money. That's where my idea takes a small twist. In exchange for helping me realise my lifetime dream I have launched a website. People who take up one of my perks can be a part of that website and that can help them promote their own campaigns here on Indiegogo at the same time.</li>
<li>By purchasing a perk you will get to send us your image or logo etc and have it placed into your reserved pixel spot on our website. This spot will then link back to your own campaign. Check out our sample links on the website which point back to this very campaign.</li>

Please note that the web site will remain active after our campaign finishes, so you link will stay active until your own campaign ends.</li>
<li>My expectation is that this project will become quite viral and that means much much exposure for those people who see the opportunity and take up on a perk while they last.</li>
<li>As we are working with the flexible funding mode, we are notified immediately when a contribution comes through. People who take up a perk will be contacted by email to provide us with their image / logo and link etc ... so as soon as your payment has come through we are notified and we will begin adding the links to our website.

Get on board early and capitalize on the traffic that this campaign will generate for our website and for YOUR CAMPAIGN link.</li>

<p>The Opportunity<br/><br/>Gelat’ONE is a fantastic investment opportunity which offers a chance to <br/>get in on the ground floor of a new first-class brand in the making. We <br/>are creating an authentic Italian Gelateria and Coffee House experience <br/>to take advantage of the lack of high quality gelato parlours in London <br/>and the UK. We are seeking £550,000 in start-up capital to establish a <br/>showcase location in London and launch a chain of 8 shops in 5 years. <br/>Investors can invest though 2 year 8% Term Financing, or a 20% Equity <br/>stake with a minimum 3 yr commitment. The team projects a 59% ROI in 3 years, 272% ROI in 4 years and 603% in 5 years.<br/><br/>The Team<br/><br/>Gelat’ONE  is the idea of Stefano Brozzoni, Laurence Mahut and Gerardo <br/>Pirola and is an original Italian gelato product and experience made in <br/>the traditional way, with organic ingredients and hand crafting. We are <br/>very passionate about fresh and natural Italian products and we also <br/>have solid business experience behind us. <br/><br/>We believe there is lack of high quality gelato parlours in London (and <br/>in Britain) and there is a serious business opportunity to develop a <br/>quality chain of authentic Italian Gelateria which will not only provide<br/> the highest quality gelato in the world, it will also provide an <br/>authentic and compelling café experience that will bring the customer<br/>right to the heart of Italia.<br/><br/>We also believe that, more than ever, consumers are looking for natural <br/>quality products without added fats and industrial treatments. At the <br/>same time, Italian food and the Italian way of life is recognized as beneficial for <br/>one’s health and one’s soul. <br/><br/>Our Vision<br/><br/>We plan is to establish a UK based chain of gelato shops in the heart of<br/> London.  Our market analysis demonstrates that UK consumers want <br/>low-fat, healthy foods, and our gelato meets this need as it made <br/>without the use of added hydrogenated fats, colorants and preservatives,<br/> emulsifiers and unnatural thickeners  (as routinely  done by 99% of <br/>the existing ice-cream and gelato makers), whether handmade and <br/>industrial. We intend use local suppliers, who can provide us organic <br/>milk from certified farms, fresh cream and eggs from land-based farms. <br/>In addition to the main draw of delicious gelato, our shops will “bring <br/>the customer” to the café Italia experience and offer coffees including <br/>espresso, cappuccino, latte macchiato made by Italian artisanal <br/>roasters. <br/><br/>The Market<br/><br/>The UK market is the sixth largest economy in the world with flexible <br/>labour, attractive tax rates a compelling leisure and shopping segment <br/>that goes hand and glove with quality Italian Gelato. The UK ice cream <br/>industry posted 9% value growth in 2012, which was up on 2011 and has <br/>been driven by innovation, heavy advertising and increasing demand from <br/>British consumers. Combine the above trend with high quality Italian<br/> gelato and you have a powerful model for revenue and growth.  <br/><br/>A recent article in The Independent said  “When is an ice cream not an <br/>ice cream? When it's a ‘gelato’! A new fashion for frozen desserts with <br/>lower fat content than traditional ice-cream has become a <br/>multi-million-pound industry in Britain, with new outlets springing up <br/>almost weekly. Over the past two years some 80 have opened across <br/>London.”<br/><br/>This trend is building and Italian fresh handmade low fat ice cream <br/>(gelato) is becoming more and more popular in the UK as consumers <br/>increasingly look for handmade natural products with high nutritional <br/>value as well as great taste. Euromonitor International reports that <br/>Single portion gelato sales recorded one of the fastest retail value <br/>growths of 38% in 2012. <br/><br/>Our Plan<br/><br/>1.   Establish a unique Italian atmosphere where customers can relax and enjoy themselves in the heart of London by this fall.<br/>2.    Provide high quality artisanal Italian ice cream for customers at a reasonable price. <br/>3.    Obtain and maintain a dedicated workforce to provide superior customer service. <br/>4.   Establish and maintain a customer base large enough to sustain year round operations and provide for future growth. <br/>5.   Open gelato shops in central London through organic growth beginning in year two.<br/>6.   Be a recognized first rate chain throughout London within 5 years. <br/><br/>In Summary<br/><br/>We are raising £550,000 of start-up capital in 2014 to launch our <br/>project and open the first shop in 2015 in exchange for a <br/>generous financing rate and high return equity participation. <br/><br/><br/><br/></p>

<div class=""Section1"">
<p><span>Hi, my name is Marianna Mills.</span></p>
<p>I am a Hungarian artist, self-taught, and a single mother of two young children. I am going through a lengthy divorce, which appears to be finally nearing its conclusion. I endured domestic violence in my marriage of fifteen years, until it finally became too painful.  I didn’t even want to mention my divorce here, but it was, and still is, playing quite a large part in my health and financial problems.</p>
<p> Listing my project on Indiegogo was my son Edward’s idea, to help raise the funds for my preliminary medical testing, and later on for the most appropriate treatment. So, here is my story:</p>
<p> Last year, as a result of my routine PAP smear test, I was diagnosed with a large Myoma in my uterus.  A myoma is a non-malignant fibroid tumor.  Sadly, I had missed a few smear tests in the past, since moving back toHungary. My ex-husband is British, and we lived in the UK for over eleven years.  That's where my children were born. I went every two years to have a smear test done by the local nurse. Since my daughter was born, and after returning to my native Hungary, I haven't even seen a gynecologist, and I am guessing that's why the fibroids in my uterus were never discovered earlier. </p>
<p> Because of the large size of the fibroids (3-3.5"" measured in the last ultrasound in January 2013), the doctors booked me for a hysterectomy this past <a rel=""noopener nofollow"">January 21st.</a> They told me that, at my age (I am 43 years old), it's the easiest way to deal with the Myoma. But I don't want to undergo major surgery if other, less invasive, treatments are available in other parts of the world. </p>
<p> With a friend's help, I found the Mayo Clinic’s Clinical Trial website, and have been in contact several times with their trial coordinator, who assured me that, if I can travel to the US for testing, they can determine which treatment is most appropriate for me. Then, in a few weeks time, I can participate in the clinical trial itself; which, in addition to benefiting me, will provide research data to help other women choose the best available treatment to reduce or remove their myomas.</p>
<p> At this time, I earn my living with my art, but make only enough to put food on the table for my two kids and me, and to pay our utility bills.  My ex-husband has not contributed his required child support, and my family’s resources are very limited. To date, I have not been able to put any money aside for my travel to the US for the preliminary testing or for the actual surgery.</p>
<p>What is upsetting me the most is knowing I have potential to sell my art, but because people can not easily find my artwork on the Internet, I need to ask for help from generous people on Indiegogo to finance my health project.</p>
<p> I need at least $8,000USD for the testing, the travel cost to the US, lodging, food and expenses, and to pay my utility bills at home while I am away.  I will also need to take time off from working.</p>
<p> I can not raise so much money by myself at the moment. If I can do it here on Indiegogo, it will be amazing to know that I can be myoma free, can look after my children without pain or thoughts that there is something growing inside me.</p>
<p> So, if people decide to help with my health project, I want to give something back to each of them. You are more than welcome to contribute without claiming your perk.  But it would make me feel better if you do, as I don’t want to just get something without giving something back.</p>
<p> If I can not reach my goal, the funds will be put aside until I have the remaining money to finance my project. If, God willing, I exceed my goal, I will put that money towards to my next project, the actual treatment.</p>
<p> What you need to realize, is that this fund will not only help me and my kids, who rely on me; but it will also help other women in the world, because I will be participating in the clinical trial, which is designed to determine which is the best type of treatment for each particular woman. So, every contribution will help.</p>
<p> I will try to take pictures, and will write on my social media sites daily, about my journey and experiences with this project, in order to keep you informed. If it’s possible, I hope to meet some of the people who support my project and would like to claim their perks in person while I will be in the US; especially those who will receive my higher value paintings. I certainly wouldn’t mind taking them with me on my journey. But, we can arrange that later through email or by a Skype call.</p>
<p> I understand that not everyone is in a position to donate money. Even if you cannot contribute financially, you can still help support my cause by passing my message on to your friends and family. Sharing this campaign, or even just my website link on Facebook, Twitter, or your blog has a bigger impact than you know! </p>
<p><span>Weather or not you contribute to my campaign, please take a moment to share it with your social media contacts, or pass it on to someone you know that is passionate about art!  You will earn my eternal gratitude.</span></p>

<p>The Appreciation Board™ will be a 9x12 magnetic whiteboard with a 1 inch frame. The frame will come in white, black and dark cherry to start. More colors may be added later depending on demand. It will ship with a magnetic marker pen and hardware to hang on a wall or a metal surface like a refrigerator.</p>
<p>We have spent many months toiling over the details and have finally selected a manufacturer who is lined up and ready to start making them for us; we now just need the capital to fund the project. $3,000 is the minimum we need to raise in order to place a product order. Any additional raised beyond $3,000 will be used to help promote and expand the business in the following ways: upcoming trade shows in Seattle in January ($2,000), San Francisco in February ($3,500) and Portland in April ($800). We will also need to fund marketing efforts and possible travel expenses to meet with buyers.</p>
<p>Here are samples of the standard Appreciation Board™ that will be produced and offered for the $25+ rewards. This is the product that will eventually be distributed to stores and sold retail. YOU ARE GETTING IT FIRST BY CONTRIBUTING TO THIS PROJECT! <strong>(PLEASE NOTE, THESE ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE CUSTOM FRAMES LISTED FURTHER DOWN BELOW.)</strong></p>

<h1>How It All Began... (as told by Liz)</h1>
<p>Sometime in early 2012 I was having a very bad week - feeling taken advantage of, unrecognized for the things I did for my family and basically just unappreciated. So, I went on strike. Typically Jeff was able to tell when this internal shift would start to happen, and would pull me out of it with an encouraging word, a warm and sincere hug or a gracious thank you. But this time he was just too busy with work and an upcoming business trip, so he too was emotionally drained himself.</p>
<p>After he left, we talked about it and he gave me some very warm words that made my heart smile. The next day I was back to my old self - humming, cleaning and just seeing everything more positively. Then I stopped suddenly and wondered, ""Where did I get all this energy from?!"" Just the day before I was lounging in my PJs all day... Then it occurred to me: it was what Jeff had told me! I understood more clearly the power of words. Then I wondered, ""How would our kids feel if we (Jeff and I) made more of an effort to positively recognize them?"" so I created an ""appreciation board"". It took off! Jeff and I wrote to each other; the kids wrote to us; the kids wrote to one another, it was amazing! But, the biggest amazement was how our house began to change. The kids were more patient with each other, they showed more respect to Jeff and I, laughter rang the roof more often and there were more hugs being shared. We saw that we see each other and it felt good.</p>
<p>One day Jeff came bounding out of his office - he had an epiphany. He said, ""Liz, we should share this with others!"" We thought about how it made us feel (empowered, recognized and seen) when we saw our own name on the board, and we realized how powerful the idea was.  We decided it definitely needed to be shared. So here we are now as Expressive Ideas, LLC hoping to bring the Appreciation Board™ to the world.</p>
<p>With your help we can do it. :-)</p>
<h3 class=""dotty""><span>Possible Challenges</span></h3>
<p>We have done our due diligence, but there are always risks with any endeavor. Possible challenges will come with manufacturing. While we are working with a reputable manufacturer, there is always the possibility for delays in the process. Assuming a successful campaign, we are expecting the Appreciation Boards to be completed and ready for sale/distribution by the end of February 2013. If there are any hiccups in production, that timeline will be pushed back.</p>
<p>The other possible challenge will be with the custom designed Appreciation Boards. Since they will all be personally hand crafted by Liz, there may be a longer than anticipated wait time for receiving your board. However, we will provide updates on our progress with your Appreciation Board™.</p>

We want to make the site worthy of the incredible place it will be representing which is why we're asking for your help. <br/><br/>The new website will provide a place for people to find out more information, to donate, to arrange a visit, to connect with similar organisations and to help with expansion projects.</strong></h3>
<p><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Computer Education for over 500 children </span></strong></p>
<p><span class=""content"">The centre has partnered with Intel Corporation to pilot a computer program specially designed for children. The centre is fully equipped with mini laptops which the children get to use every day. For children who live in tin houses with no electricity, this is a unique and incredible opportunity. The computer program was so successful at the centre </span>that it has now expanded into the local public schools. The government are very interested in extending the program all across Kenya.</p>
<p><span class=""content""><strong><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Nutrition &amp; Knowledge</span><br/></strong>The educational day program provides two nutritious meals and early childhood education for the poorest of children age 2-7 from the nearby slum communities.</span></p>

<p>The pregnancy support centre is a <span class=""content"">residential program supporting teenage girls who do not have family support during their pregnancies. Many of these girls have been thrown out of school or sent away from their families as a result of their pregnancy.</span> </p>
<p><strong>All of this amazing work and hardly anybody has heard of The Karibu Centre. We want this to change. We want to provide a new website to help them achieve the development, funding and expansion they so deserve.</strong></p>

<div> </div></div>","The Karibu Centre is making a difference to the lives of hundreds of disadvantaged children in Kenya.
We want to build a new website and produce a promotional film so that more people can find out about and contribute to the development plans at the Children's centre.
Your support for our project is so important. A decent website seems like such a simple thing but expansion and future funding for the centre would be almost impossible without it. We want to make the site worthy of the incredible place it will be representing which is why we're asking for your help. The new website will provide a place for people to find out more information, to donate, to arrange a visit, to connect with similar organisations and to help with expansion projects.
Computer Education for over 500 children 
The centre has partnered with Intel Corporation to pilot a computer program specially designed for children. The centre is fully equipped with mini laptops which the children get to use every day. For children who live in tin houses with no electricity, this is a unique and incredible opportunity. The computer program was so successful at the centre that it has now expanded into the local public schools. The government are very interested in extending the program all across Kenya.
Nutrition & KnowledgeThe educational day program provides two nutritious meals and early childhood education for the poorest of children age 2-7 from the nearby slum communities.
Rescuing Vulnerable Mothers and BabiesThe abandoned baby centre provides rescue care for starving, neglected, and medically fragile babies - including HIV positive infants. The babies are loved and nurtured until they can be resettled back into their birth families or placed with a family for adoption.
The pregnancy support centre is a residential program supporting teenage girls who do not have family support during their pregnancies. Many of these girls have been thrown out of school or sent away from their families as a result of their pregnancy. 
All of this amazing work and hardly anybody has heard of The Karibu Centre. We want this to change. We want to provide a new website to help them achieve the development, funding and expansion they so deserve.
We need to raise $4000 (£2,500) to cover the costs of the web design and film editing.

<h3>Help us meet our stretch goals!</h3>
<p>Anything over and above the goal can only benefit this venture further! Let's move some goalposts and see if we can get enough support to help cover some of these additional anticipated costs:</p>
<ol>
<li>We have enough for ten ISBNs at the $250 price point. <strong>But, we could also purchase 100 ISBNs for $575! </strong>Here's a link to the pricing, in case you're wondering where that number comes from: <a href=""https://www.myidentifiers.com/isbn/main"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.myidentifiers.com/isbn/main</a>. 10 ISBNs would cover us for a year; 100 would cover us for a looooooooong time!</li>
<li>Adobe's Creative Suite, which contains everything that I'd need to do some awesome layouts, costs a lot of money. But, as a UW staff member, I can purchase a discounted license for a mere <strong>$250. Wow! </strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>IndieGoGo's fee</strong>. It's 4% of what I raise, so any little bit helps cover that fee.</li>
<li>
<strong>Business training. </strong>I plan to take some classes and seminars, which will cost anywhere from <strong>$100-$500.</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Professional memberships and conference fees. </strong>We'll be joining as many small press/publishing organizations as possible, and covering fees, dues and conference registrations will of course cost, as well.</li>
<li>
<strong>Author advances. </strong>Once we start publishing <strong>your</strong> work, we'll need some funds for advances.</li>
<li>
<strong>Goodies and treats. </strong>I'd like to make regular give-aways part of our publishing plan!</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, all of this is gravy, but the more seed funds we raise, the more we can do, and the more successful we'll ultimately be. <strong>Any amount you can contribute will help us meet these goals!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Regardless, I anticipate having my first title available by the end of April!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks so much-- let's KEEP THIS BALL ROLLING!</strong></p>

<p>My name is Jeremy Puma, and I write. Now, I'd like to publish.</p>
<p><img alt=""Jeremy Puma and Son"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/396278_404073172998589_289952372_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left; margin: 8px;"" title=""Pictured: The Author With Cute Baby Son""/></p>
<p>I've registered as a sole proprietor business owner under the name <strong>Strange Animal Publications!</strong></p>
<p>I’ve had some success in the self-publishing and blogging arenas, enough to have a fairly decent readership established, and sales on <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Jeremy-Puma/e/B007HP7ECS"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Amazon in print and Kindle platforms</a> are pretty darned good.</p>
<p>During the process of self-publishing, I discovered that I love the art of putting out books. I enjoy the writing, but also the editing, the interior design, the cover design, etc. It’s all fun! So, why not see if I can supplement the ol’ income ever so slightly (without, of course, quitting the day job) while doing something I enjoy.</p>
<p>So, what will Strange Animal produce? </p>
<p><strong>Strange Animal Publications</strong> will be offering works in multiple platforms– print, electronic (Kindle, etc.) and online. Our catalog will include unique and interesting works in the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Religion/Spirituality/Philosophy</strong> – Our focus will primarily be commentary, essays and instructional work, rigorously sourced and informed by current scholarship.</li>
<li>
<strong>Speculative/Science/Weird Fiction - </strong>Interesting and unique novels and stories outside of the mainstream.</li>
<li>
<strong>Magirology - </strong>Cooking and culinary commentary, including unusual food writing and recipe collections.</li>
<li>
<strong>Reprints in all of the above - </strong>We will be scouring the public domain to bring you readable editions of fascinating and long-overlooked works from various sources.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>There’s always a market for unique and interesting voices in the genres we’re focusing on.</strong> Not only do <strong>I</strong> plan on writing works in all of the above, <strong>I also want to offer other authors the opportunity to have their work produced and published.</strong> </p>
<p>But, there are some drawbacks in moving from ‘just some guy’ to ‘oh shit an actual business.’ The most obvious is capital. To say I have less than a shoestring budget would be an understatement– it would be more accurate to say that my bank account is a big, sucking hole.</p>
<p><strong><em>And that's why I need your help.</em></strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>WHAT I NEED:</h3>
<p>I'd like to raise $1000. </p>
<ul>
<li>$250 wil be used to purchase a block of ten ISBNs (from the awful monopoly that sells them).</li>
<li>$250 will cover the costs of the business licenses and the website.</li>
<li>$300 should get the ball rolling on business-related expenses like insurance and any legal fees I haven't yet anticipated.</li>
<li>The remaining $200 will be used for the fees associated with Print-on-Demand publishing, including distribution costs and proof orders.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, there'll be additional expenses as I go, but this $1000 will get the ball rolling. If I do manage to raise more than the goal, it'll go towards desktop publishing software and the cumulative costs of running a business.</p>
<h3>IF I DON'T REACH MY GOAL</h3>
<p>Oh, I'm still doing this. It might take a little longer, but <strong>Strange Animal Publications </strong>will still happen. Before you contribute, please keep in mind that IndieGoGo will award funds <strong>even if the goal isn't met</strong>, so any little bit will help, and although it may take a little longer if I don't make the $1000, you'll still receive your perk as soon as it happens. Heck, even if I can raise $250, that'll get me those ISBNs.</p>
<h3>WHAT YOU GET:</h3>
<p>There are a number of donor perks described here, all of which are mighty cool, but you also get Books! Literature! You get the satisfaction of knowing that quality, interesting and unique material will be out there in the world, put out there by a guy who loves books and who loves to write.</p>
<h3>THE PLAN:</h3>
<p>1. For the next year, work on generating revenue through self-publishing a couple of my own books. I know how to do this, but now I’ll be doing it as an ‘official business,’ instead of  ’a guy with a website.’ I also plan to find some really cool work in the public domain that would benefit from a dusting-off and repackaging in readable format. Add some value (intros, footnotes, etc.) and publish that as well. </p>
<p>While working on item #1,</p>
<p>2. Learn the ins and outs of basic business skills via books, classes, seminars, etc.</p>
<p>3. Learn the ins and outs of basic publishing skills by doing it.</p>
<p>4. Since, for the first year, I will be the only original author I publish, and the remainder will be work from the public domain (yes I know about the rigors of proper copyright investigation etc.), I won’t have to worry about ruining anyone’s reputation but my own, and my uber-supportive family (shout-out to Emily, the best wife in the universe) will also be safe from risk.</p>
<p>5. Beginning in 2014, when I’ve honed my skills and upgraded my business/publishing acumen, start soliciting work from authors and publishing.</p>

<h3>Monica and Jeff are in love and separated by a border.  Help us so we can be together again and live happily ever after!</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The love of my life and my future wife Monica was removed from the U.S. back in 2008 by immigration.  You can see the picture of us above during happier times in 2007.  Due to the nature of her removal and the vagueness of the law written for our situation, the only way she can obtain her Visa to return to the US is to apply for an I-601 waiver.  Its a very difficult and time consuming process as well as very expensive.  We applied once and after an entire year of waiting for our answer we received a letter in the mail that we were denied.  After speaking with my attorney I was told that according to her review of the denial, the consulate made an error in the review of our documentation but to submit for an appeal would take up to several years and that the best way to proceed was to just re-apply.  The process we went through the first time cost me in lawyer fees, immigration fees, travel, etc over $12,000 which was my entire savings.  I spent everything I had because we want to be together so much. </p>
<p>So since the denial letter, I have been in contact with the US Consulate and we have been given the opportunity to re-apply immediately and I have found a great new immigration attorney who specializes in the waiver for which we are applying and has great success in these particular cases.  I am unable to start with the new application until I raise $4,000 to pay our new attorney to prepare the new paperwork.  This amount is just for the attorney fees.  It does not include the additional amounts that we will ultimately have to pay for filing the applications as well as the cost of travelling and staying in Juarez Mexico during our visit to the US Consulate.</p>
<p>I am hoping there are others out there who have been through what we are going through or just someone who knows what its like to be so in love and be separated from that loved one, and is willing to help out 2 hearts who are so in love with each other and want to be together forever. </p>
<p>Monica is a sweet, caring and loving person.  She is an aunt to 4 wonderful nephews and 1 niece, she is a school teacher in the town of Hermosillo Mexico and she is a very religious person as well.  Myself, I am American born.  I have run my own business for the last 7 years and due to the tough economic times, I don't have the finances to start the process again.  I am a very giving person, and in fact I have gone overseas into war zones in Iraq and Afghanistan to play music for our troops on several occasions.  I am hoping there are other giving people out there who understand what we are going through and would be willing to help out 2 wonderful people who only want to be together again and love each other so very much.  </p>

<h3>Tina's Fund for Domestic Violence Awareness is a 501(c)3 which was founded in 2006.  Our mission is to bring awareness to our community about the effects of domestic violence with an emphasis on educating our children,  We believe that our children are the ones who can break the chain of domestic violence.</h3>
<p>Through this campaign we are hoping to raise the monies necessary to build the Memorial Garden.  Contained in the garden will be a black granite monument etched with the names of those victims who have died as a result of domestic violence, two black granite benches, two weeping cherry trees and a section for purple flowers.  We will invite local groups to get involved through all phases of construction.  Local churches have offered their services to not only plant the garden but also to maintain it.</p>
<p>Your contribution will assist us to not only make this project a reality but also to help us bring awareness to our community.  We realize from past events that though you may have your attendees in the ""moment"" during the event, most will forget your message a week later,  This Memorial Garden will be a living reminder of the devastating effects of domestic violence.</p>
<p>We have asked for $10,000 as that will cover the cost of the monument, benches, cherry trees and flowers.  Your contribution will ensure that future generations will be able to see what an impact domestic violence makes on a community.</p>
<p>This Memorial Garden will be a place to hold annual events to include annual etching of names on the monument followed by a Memorial Service.  State and local dignitaries will be invited as well as the media and the general public.  This Memorial Service will be held during the month of October which is National Domestic Violence Awareness month.  We are also planning a Run/Walk for the following day to make this a weekend event.  These events will allow us to get our message out through the media and also by handing out materials.</p>
<p>This Memorial Garden is a benchmark in New Jersey as there are none like it.  We are hoping that upon our successful completion of this project that we will be able to go into other communities and do the same.</p>

To remember her on her 23rd birthday (January 1st), her family would like to erect a sign in her memory at the site of her crash, reminding other drivers to drive safely. To keep others from suffering this tragic fate, her family wants to begin saving money and petitioning the state to put a fence up around the cemetery where the crash occurred. There are many different styles of headstones in this area and it is the largest cemetery in the city of Petersburg, making it a roadside hazard, as proved with this exact fatality.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>This campaign is almost a test-run to see if we can make it to a full-blown fence for Rose Hill Cemetery. As we save money, we are talking to the Illinois Department of Transportation, the city council in Petersburg, Illinois, and the owners of Rose Hill Cemetery to see how a fence could be erected to protect others from this kind of fatality.</p> <ul> <li>This is not going to be cheap, if the fence becomes a clear possibility. Quotes from companies such as Ameristar Fencing have been only as cheap as $160,200. The minimum $500 is to build a memorial sign and to kick start the fence fund.</li> <li>You don't have to be anonymous! If you knew Shara and you want everyone to know that you loved her, you can tell the town in the paper! Want to know how grateful her family is that you're helping this cause? You can get a personal letter delivered to your door! Want to see the end product of what you helped create? How about a glossy photo of the memorial sign to hang on the wall?</li> <li>Of course we're not going to raise all the money for the fence with this one campaign, so if we make all of the goal, get ready for another campaign! Funds will go to a private savings account at Petefish Skiles &amp; Co. in Petersburg, Illinois, called ""The Rose Hill Safety Fence.""</li>
</ul>
</div><div>

</div></div>","Short Summary Shara Bagby was 22 years old when she died in a fatal and tragic car crash on April 16, 2014. To remember her on her 23rd birthday (January 1st), her family would like to erect a sign in her memory at the site of her crash, reminding other drivers to drive safely. To keep others from suffering this tragic fate, her family wants to begin saving money and petitioning the state to put a fence up around the cemetery where the crash occurred. There are many different styles of headstones in this area and it is the largest cemetery in the city of Petersburg, making it a roadside hazard, as proved with this exact fatality.   What We Need & What You Get This campaign is almost a test-run to see if we can make it to a full-blown fence for Rose Hill Cemetery. As we save money, we are talking to the Illinois Department of Transportation, the city council in Petersburg, Illinois, and the owners of Rose Hill Cemetery to see how a fence could be erected to protect others from this kind of fatality.  This is not going to be cheap, if the fence becomes a clear possibility. Quotes from companies such as Ameristar Fencing have been only as cheap as $160,200. The minimum $500 is to build a memorial sign and to kick start the fence fund. You don't have to be anonymous! If you knew Shara and you want everyone to know that you loved her, you can tell the town in the paper! Want to know how grateful her family is that you're helping this cause? You can get a personal letter delivered to your door! Want to see the end product of what you helped create? How about a glossy photo of the memorial sign to hang on the wall? Of course we're not going to raise all the money for the fence with this one campaign, so if we make all of the goal, get ready for another campaign! Funds will go to a private savings account at Petefish Skiles & Co. in Petersburg, Illinois, called ""The Rose Hill Safety Fence.""


    Risks & Challenges  Since April 16, 2014, we have been trying to get the state and city of Petersburg to work with us on getting Rose Hill to become a safer place. Just because it's not a high accident site, doesn't mean precautions shouldn't be taken to prevent more deaths like Shara's.
Since the accident, Trisha (sister) and Michelle (mother) have worked in tandem to write papers and presentations on why and how the fence should be erected in Shara's memory and for others' safety.    Other Ways You Can Help Can't afford to donate? No worries!   Share this with your friends who can! Making some noise about this is just as valuable as donating money because it tells IDOT, the city of Petersburg, and Rose Hill Cemetery that one death because of this failure to take precaution is one too many and we will not stand for it!

Hello, my name is
Quintonio Blakney, a veteran window film installer with over 12 years
experience in the automotive and residential window film/tint industry. I need
your help with bringing this business to life. With my experience in the window
film/tint industry there is a lack of great customer service and high quality
products at an affordable price. I would like to give my clients the ultimate
customer experience where both male and female could come and feel comfortable
to know that they will receive the best service and quality product at an
affordable rate with no worries.
About Us



Tinter’s
Elite Automotive & Residential Window Film is a startup specialty window
tinting shop that will be launched in the coming months. We will sell and
install premium high quality automotive and residential window film. 
How Will The Funds Be Used?
Total
start-up funding needed is $11K, which all funds will go towards:



·    Company Location 


·    Inventory


·    Legal Fees


·    Building Signs


·    Stationery


·    Location Renovations


·    Marketing


·    Uniforms


·    Indiegogo Fees


·   
And other related expenses



What Happens To The Funds If Goal Not Reached?
If
goal is not reached, all funds will still go toward the business, until
business is fully up and running.
What
Makes Us Different?
Tinter’s Elite Automotive & Residential Window Film will set itself apart from other window film/tint service facilities that may offer only one or two types of services. While talking to several people, they are frustrated with going to different businesses to accomplish their goals.However, I am proposing to make this window tint/film shop a ""one stop shop"" business. The focus of Tinter’s Elite Automotive & Residential Window Film is high quality premium window film/tint, affordability, and overall customer experience. The services we are going to provide will be above and beyond what our competition can offer.Our business atmosphere will be clean, friendly and upscale where customers will be comfortable leaving their vehicles. We will offer a personal touch, such as customer care packages and customer loyalty incentives rewards for those that registered with Tinter’s Elite Automotive & Residential Window Film.Why Invest In Automotive and Residential Window Film/Tint?
Automotive
window film/tinting creates a cool, custom look for your vehicle, but not many
people know there are many other functional benefits of window film/tint
your automobile or home. 





Automotive
and Residential window film/tint blocks up to 99% of the sun’s harmful UV rays,
If you are in the car for extended periods, car window tinting is
important for protecting you and loved ones from cancer-causing UV rays.
UV protection comes in various grades, and you do not need to have windows
significantly darkened to block UV.

In
addition to UV, the sun also tends to create uncomfortable heat inside your
car. Window tinting also blocks up to 71% of solar energy, which allows a
person to stay comfortable and prevent expensive, overuse of the AC.



Car and home windows are designed to reduce injury when broken, but automotive and residential window film/tint brings
window security to a new level. Since window tint covers entire panes,
broken glass stays in one piece, greatly reducing chances of injury from
glass shards. An added benefit is that cleanup is much easier after breakage.



Automotive window tinting also protects from car theft. Security tint makes car windows
more durable, and, since broken glass is held together, even a thief that

<p>
</p>
<p>YMALA wants to be a
partner for entrepreneurs not only a financier. For this purpose, a
new company will be founded for a start-up where YMALA will hold the
majority of shares. The new company will commit itself to the YMALA
standards and will pay a part of its sales to YMALA in order to
support new start-ups.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What is the Project about?</h3>
<p>The establishment of a
cooperative to promote business ideas and innovation.</p>
<p>The objective does not
consists of being a profit-orientated enterprise but rather aiming at
providing people with business ideas with the necessary capital as
well as professional advice and assistance.</p>
<p>This cooperative is
supposed to be the holding companies of different activities. It is
founding a GmbH (company) for people like you with a perspectival
business idea.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Why should you support this Project?</h3>
<p>It allows you to be a
member in an innovative cooperative, which promotes not only
financial, but also technical innovation.</p>
<p>The established companies
are not dependent on neither investors, who aim at high profits and
returns nor on banks, which require high securities.</p>
<p>In addition, you will
receive a discount on all products of affiliates companies by joining
the cooperative.</p>
<p>YMALA encourages
innovation without the commitment to high returns.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Benefits for Company Founders:</h3>
<p>-General low risk<br/>
-Advertisement of their
idea provided by the community of YMALA<br/>
-Free scope<br/>
-Consulting and promotion<br/>
-Support of business ideas
as well as just and reasonable working condition</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Benefits for Members:</b><br/>-A
say at every shareholders' meeting<br/>-5% discount on all products of
every subsidiary company<br/>-Support of innovative business ideas as
well as fair working conditions</p>
<h3>For the Companies apply the YMALA
Standards:</h3>
<p>-No aggressive advertising
and no foreign advertise on its own media<br/>
-companies should focuse
on long-term existence and job security<br/>
-15€/h minimum wage<br/>
-The highest wage is
	maximally five times higher than the lowest wage<br/>
-Environmentally
	friendly work<br/>
-It should be aimed at
	a “cradle-to-cradle” certification<br/>
-Renewable energy and
	materials should be preferred</p>
<p>The standards should
represent and develop a social character in which they combine
sustainability and business. In addition, people should be able to
live on their income without having to rely on public funding. This
also shows the slogan of YMALA  “Future with Innovation“. This is
why a corporate culture should be created which insists on long-term
existence, innovation and social working conditions.</p>
<p>On the implementation of
business ideas decides the cooperative, but it should also be
possible to speak out for a project by the members.</p>
<h3>What are the Aims and who is the
Target Group?</h3>
<p>The goal is to create safe
and equitable working conditions.</p>
<p>Our target groups are
people with innovative business ideas and people supporting them.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>What happens with the Funding?</h3>
<p>Upon successful financing,
the money goes into the funding of a cooperative, creation of the
organisation as well as in the financing of the first projects.</p>
<p>In addition, YMALA needs a
website, the developing of the marketing concept and a logo design.
After the funding, everybody is able to acquire any shares of the
cooperative. So far it is planned that this will cost 50€ plus 50€
entrance fee and an annual contribution of 24€.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The first project will be
setting up a Jabber server, which can be used free of charge. Jabber
allows secure and free communication. The platform-independent
communication of Jabber is another advantage of YMALA.</p>
<p>The continued funding will
run on the cooperative.</p>

Innovation"".So soll eine Unternehmenskultur geschaffen
werden, welche auf langfristiges Bestehen, Innovation und soziale
Arbeitsbedingungen ausgerichtet ist.
Über die Umsetzung von Geschäftsideen entscheidet die
Genossenschaft. Aber es soll auch den Genossenschaftsmitgliedern
möglich sein, sich für ein Projekt auszusprechen.
Was sind die Ziele und wer die Zielgruppe?
Ziel ist es, sichere und gerechte Arbeitsbedingungen zu schaffen.
Unsere Zielgruppen sind Menschen wie Sie mit innovativen
Geschäftsideen und Menschen wie Ihnen, die diese unterstützen
wollen.
Was passiert mit dem Geld bei erfolgreicher
Finanzierung?
Bei erfolgreicher Finanzierung fließt das Geld in die Gründung
einer Genossenschaft, Schaffung einer Organisation sowie in die
Finanzierung der ersten Projekte.Zusätzlich muss eine
Internetseite konzipiert, das Marketingkonzept entwickelt und ein
Logo gestaltet werden.Nach dieser Finanzierung ist es jedem
möglich, Genossenschaftsanteile zu erwerben. Bisher ist geplant,
dass diese für 50€ zzgl. 50€ Eintrittsgeld und einem jährlichen
Beitrag von 24€ zu erhalten sind.
Als erstes Projekt soll ein Jabber Server eingerichtet werden, der
kostenfrei genutzt werden kann. Jabber ermöglicht eine sichere und
kostenfreie Kommunikation. Ein weiterer Vorteil ist, dass Jabber eine
plattformunabhängige Kommunikation bietet und Ihr dadurch auch mit
Freunden schreiben könnt, die bei einem anderen Anbieter sind.Die
kontinuierliche Finanzierung soll über die Genossenschaft laufen.


English Version



YMALA wants to be a
partner for entrepreneurs not only a financier. For this purpose, a
new company will be founded for a start-up where YMALA will hold the
majority of shares. The new company will commit itself to the YMALA
standards and will pay a part of its sales to YMALA in order to
support new start-ups.


What is the Project about?
The establishment of a
cooperative to promote business ideas and innovation.
The objective does not
consists of being a profit-orientated enterprise but rather aiming at
providing people with business ideas with the necessary capital as
well as professional advice and assistance.
This cooperative is
supposed to be the holding companies of different activities. It is
founding a GmbH (company) for people like you with a perspectival
business idea.


Why should you support this Project?
It allows you to be a
member in an innovative cooperative, which promotes not only
financial, but also technical innovation.
The established companies
are not dependent on neither investors, who aim at high profits and
returns nor on banks, which require high securities.
In addition, you will
receive a discount on all products of affiliates companies by joining
the cooperative.
YMALA encourages
innovation without the commitment to high returns.


Benefits for Company Founders:
-General low risk
-Advertisement of their
idea provided by the community of YMALA
-Free scope
-Consulting and promotion
-Support of business ideas
as well as just and reasonable working condition


Benefits for Members:-A
say at every shareholders' meeting-5% discount on all products of
every subsidiary company-Support of innovative business ideas as
well as fair working conditions
For the Companies apply the YMALA
Standards:
-No aggressive advertising
and no foreign advertise on its own media
-companies should focuse
on long-term existence and job security
-15€/h minimum wage
-The highest wage is
	maximally five times higher than the lowest wage
-Environmentally
	friendly work
-It should be aimed at
	a “cradle-to-cradle” certification
-Renewable energy and
	materials should be preferred
The standards should
represent and develop a social character in which they combine
sustainability and business. In addition, people should be able to
live on their income without having to rely on public funding. This
also shows the slogan of YMALA  “Future with Innovation“. This is
why a corporate culture should be created which insists on long-term
existence, innovation and social working conditions.
On the implementation of
business ideas decides the cooperative, but it should also be
possible to speak out for a project by the members.
What are the Aims and who is the
Target Group?
The goal is to create safe
and equitable working conditions.
Our target groups are
people with innovative business ideas and people supporting them.


What happens with the Funding?
Upon successful financing,
the money goes into the funding of a cooperative, creation of the
organisation as well as in the financing of the first projects.
In addition, YMALA needs a
website, the developing of the marketing concept and a logo design.
After the funding, everybody is able to acquire any shares of the
cooperative. So far it is planned that this will cost 50€ plus 50€
entrance fee and an annual contribution of 24€.


The first project will be
setting up a Jabber server, which can be used free of charge. Jabber
allows secure and free communication. The platform-independent
communication of Jabber is another advantage of YMALA.
The continued funding will
run on the cooperative.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>-I work but I have no money because of college loans and other expenses.</p>
<p>-I am moving to Tucson, Arizona because I have friends there, I have a lot of job opportunities, and I want to go to school there.</p>
<p>-I need your help funding my move</p>
<p>-The money will go towards car rental expenses, places to sleep each night of the move, feeding me, and first month's rent at my new home (which is very reasonably priced).</p>
<h3><strong>Why I am in Stuart</strong></h3>
<p>Stuart, Virginia is a small but gorgeous town of 1400 friendly people. The locals often refer to Stuart as a retirement town because there are no jobs here and an enormous retired population. I came to Stuart with my boyfriend (at the time) to transition between teaching stints in China and also to stake out our future dream commune (goats included) on his grandmother's magically beautiful 30 acres. What was supposed to be a handful of months spent here has quickly turned into a year as I have watched my savings disappear to college loan payments, pet expenses, and other bills. My now ex-boyfriend's family is well-rooted in Stuart and have been an amazing support network for us but, unfortunately, we recently made an amicable decision to end our relationship, which leaves me with no future commune, no imminent trip to China, and basically no options.</p>
<h3><strong>Why the future looks bright</strong></h3>
<p>I have a plan.</p>
<p>For years now my application to the University of Arizona (U of A) has been completed and sitting idly in a computer file. I have always planned on moving to Tucson to get in-state tuition before applying. With the financial support of friends I have visited Tucson, Arizona five years in a row to spend time with my best friend in the universe Rodin and to correspond with Chinese professors at the U of A. In my five visits I have even made new friends, some of whom I foresee being lifelong best friends. When my relationship ended I knew right away that I wanted to be in Tucson. This vagabond has been aching for Tucson since visit one. </p>
<p>So on the seventh of August my friend Geri and I will be packing up a rental car and on the eighth we will be setting out on a four day journey to my new life. My friends have been amazingly supportive to me both emotionally and logistically. Geri will be flying back to NC with her own money and the ticket is already bought. I already have a house, a job interview, and some odd jobs lined up to get me on the ground running. I'll be working with kids, which I love and I'll be embedded in a community of people I love. </p>
<h3><strong>Why I need your help/ How your money will be used</strong></h3>
<p>Simply put I am broke and moving cross-country is insanely expensive. I guarantee I'm doing it the cheapest way possible. I've gotten rid of most of my belongings so I  am only taking my dog, my diabetic cat, my clothes, and my art supplies. The money you donate will go towards renting a car for the move (~$800), a place to stay each night of the journey (~$200), and the first month of rent and living expenses (~$500). On a more meaningful level the money you donate will be used to help a struggling person thrive and eventually give back wherever possible. </p>

I am a 24 year old college graduate from Raleigh, North Carolina. I currently live in Stuart, Virginia where I have been working as a barista and a traveling saleswoman of musical instruments. My dream is to be fluent in Chinese, have at least one goat, be embedded in a community, and someday be employed with a living wage.
