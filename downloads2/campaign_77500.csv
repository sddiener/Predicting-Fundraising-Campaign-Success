<p>Thousands of unaccompanied children are coming to the
United States every week.  The press has
been covering this story for several months. 
The government has known about it for several years but still hasn't
developed a plan to deal with it.  Busing
frightened children around the country and stuffing them into cold dormitories
isn't a plan.  It isn't good for the
children and it isn't good for us.  It's
time to get serious about a real problem that's getting dramatically
worse.  We need to recognize the children
for what they are, refugees.  They're
refugees from horrific conditions in their home countries.  By taking in thousands who are able to escape
we're actually making it worse for millions who are left behind.  Refusing to recognize that there's a problem
in those countries doesn't do anything to correct it or to help the people who
are suffering.  We need to get proactive
and go to the source of the problem, to the borders of Central America. </p>
<p>We're trying to
build a refugee shelter in Mexico, in the southeastern state of Tabasco, near
the border with Guatemala.  Refugee
shelters are supposed to be built near the borders of the countries from which
the refugees come.  Most refugees want to
go home, if they can, and the world community has an obligation to make it safe
for them to do so.  Making that dream
come true is our goal too but we can't do it without your help.  Please make a personal commitment to this
cause and send your donation today!</p>

It took 30 years of fishing Jamaica Bay for James “Frank the Fish” Culleton to build his home and business. It took just one night for the bay to reclaim them. For the past year, I have been documenting Frank the Fish's life as of one of Rockaway's last commercial fisherman and charter boat captain. This work has resulted in a piece entitled Devil in the Night (see below for link), and some of its images were published in the today’s New  York Times (Sunday, October 27, 2013). Devil in the Night chronicles the lasting mental and physical losses James endured during and after Superstorm Sandy. His relationship with the water is the centerpiece of his life, the prism through which he views his world. For 12 months now, I have watched Frank bounce around from place to place trying to find a warm bed. Early on, dispossessed from his ruined home, he frequently slept in the front seat of his van. He eventually  spent weeks on friends’ sofas and in a SRO. He remains in limbo.The stress of not knowing where he will sleep every night is tremendous. 
LET’S END THIS CYCLE AND HELP FRANK! 
Please help raise $7,500 so Frank can buy a motor home, allowing him to finally move back onto his property. If we succeed, it will be the first time since Superstorm Sandy hit one year ago, so that Frank will have a private place to eat, sleep, and shower. Every dollar raised will go into the purchase of a motor home for Frank.

<h3><strong>egaliHope's Global Impact</strong></h3>
<p>There are thousands of small nonprofit organizations based here in the United States doing incredible work both domestically and abroad.  Over the past year, members of the egaliHope team have been fortunate enough to work with, and become friends with, many of the outstanding individuals operating and working with just a few of these organizations.<br/><br/>As we became more familiar with each organization's story, however, it became clear to us that an overall lack of visibility, funding, and coordination, was rendering many of them inefficient, and unable to maximize the contributions they were receiving.  This then lead to the idea/concept behind egaliHope Unlimited; to create an organization that brought small nonprofit <strong><em>Partners</em></strong> and compassionate <strong><em>Givers</em></strong> together in one site, thus increasing visibility, funding opportunities, and enhanced coordination amongst small nonprofits working in the same geographic or niche areas.<br/><br/>The concept is fairly straightforward, wherein small nonprofit <strong><em>Partners </em></strong>create accounts and then submit projects related to the <strong><em>Essential Eight </em></strong>categories we have identified to help sustain communities around the world (Food, Water, Orphans, Education, Medical, Faith, Economic, and Infrastructure).  Each project is then posted on the site and, depending upon funding levels requested by the <strong><em>Partner</em></strong>, runs for a specified length of time, the culmination of which results in the <strong><em>Partner </em></strong>receiving 100% of the funding received (assuming the funding goal is met).<br/><br/>From a compassionate <strong><em>Givers</em></strong> standpoint, individual contributors will have one site that they can create accounts with and review potentially hundreds of projects worldwide that they can contribute to, again knowing that 100% of their contribution goes to the project(s) they choose.  At the same time, they will have the ability to add friends, family, and social network contacts to their own '<strong><em>myCommunity</em></strong>', thus having the broad ability to witness their global impact through their own networks.<br/><br/>As the site grows, both in <strong><em>Partners</em></strong> and <strong><em>Givers</em></strong>, our hope is that it will create a Social Network for Nonprofit Organizations, thus providing the visibility, funding, and coordination opportunities they would not be able to get on their own, and allowing them to then enjoy economies of scale that typically only larger nonprofit firms would appreciate.<br/><br/>egaliHope is a 501(c)(3) organization meaning <strong><em>all contributions are tax deductible</em></strong> (we anticipate receiving our IRS designation this spring as we applied in June 2012).  We are also so happy to be joined on our Board of Directors by some of the finest friends that we could imagine teaming with, both in regards to their character and their faithful compassion towards others.</p>
<h3><strong>Who we are</strong></h3>
<p>The concept of egaliHope was developed by Tom Shaffer, a manufacturing manager by trade, after a variety of life events. Tom and his family moved to Columbus, Ohio and began to attend a church that had 100 countries represented. During this time, Tom was also reading the book ""The Hole in our Gospel"" written by the President of World Vision, Richard Sterns. Moved by the tremedous need of people around the world and discovering the work of various nonprofits serving to bring about lasting change in these communities, Tom &amp; a group of his friends formulated the original concepts of egaliHope.</p>
<p>At the same time, Tom and his wife Michele were blessed enough to be able to adopt two beautiful little boys from Ghana to add to their existing family of four biological children, thus increasing the passion to reach out and help others.</p>
<p>egaliHope is a new innovative nonprofit organization connecting compassionate givers to the projects managed by small to medium sized nonprofits. We are focused on small to medium sized nonprofits because they need increased visibility to attract funding and we believe that egaliHope will also create nonprofit connections that will provide efficiencies in the work being done around the world. Nonprofits will leverage each other's competencies so that dollars received go a long way.  </p>
<p>For the compassionate givers that visit the website, by using egaliHope to support nonprofits, you will be able to see your global impact. You'll have the opportunity to connect your friends through other social media outlets (ex. facebook, linkedIn) and see how your community (myCommunity) can be part of buidling sustainable communities around the world through your own myHope page. </p>
<p><span>While we collectively cannot ensure that all people share the same levels of economic, educational, spiritual, and healthcare opportunities, we believe that we can collectively create a world where each individual has an “equal” (egal) amount of Hope regarding their future.</span></p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>Our organization will support its own administrative and overhead expenses, thus 100% of the funds designated for each project will go to the nonprofit organization sponsoring the project.  As a result, we need your help raising dollars to develop our website and pay for operating expenses. <br/><br/>We are currently in the process of developing egaliHope's website, which will be instrumental in realizing our mission. We are asking for $65,000 to cover the development and operational expenses for calendar year 2013. The funding for this campaign will go towards website development, graphic design, legal &amp; accounting fees and marketing. </p>
<p>Although we are awaiting our official 501(c)3 IRS Determination Letter, we are currently a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization per IRS regulations for the next three calendar years (2015), as such, all contributions to this campaign are tax deductible. We anticipate receipt of our Determination Letter in early 2013 as we submitted our application in June, 2012. </p>
<p>All contributions to this campaign that are between $25-$99 will receive a special shout out on our Facebook page and contributions of $100 or more will be individually listed as an Angel Investor on egaliHope's website for a minimum of one year. </p>
<p>Help us bring egaliHope to life!</p>

Although we are awaiting our official 501(c)3 IRS Determination Letter, we are currently a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization per IRS regulations for the next three calendar years (2015), as such, all contributions to this campaign are tax deductible. We anticipate receipt of our Determination Letter in early 2013 as we submitted our application in June, 2012. 
All contributions to this campaign that are between $25-$99 will receive a special shout out on our Facebook page and contributions of $100 or more will be individually listed as an Angel Investor on egaliHope's website for a minimum of one year. 
Help us bring egaliHope to life!

<p>Founders Kathryn Minshew, Alex Cavoulacos, and Melissa McCreery met in their first job out of college at a management consulting firm. There they learned the ins and outs of the business world, but also found that a lot of what work was about wasn't taught in school: should you be negotiating your first salary? If so, how do you do so without offending your first employer? What happens if you want to change careers? How can you speak with confidence the first time you're put in front of a room of executives? How do you balance your job and your personal life (or your checkbook...)?<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>After joining forces on another venture, Kathryn, Alex, and Melissa knew that they wanted to work together to help young professional women like themselves. They assembled a <a href=""http://www.daily-muse.com/meet-the-team/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title="""">top-notch team</a> of editors, writers, business minds, social media ninjas, talented illustrators, marketing gurus, and event whizzes (yup, the whole nine yards), and <span style=""font-style: italic;"">The Daily Muse</span> was born.<br/></p>

<h3>The Vision</h3>
<p>There’s a movement coming. You can’t find it in <em>Cosmopolitan</em> or the latest issue of <em>US Weekly.</em> You may not notice it in <em>GQ</em> or <em>Esquire. </em>But look a little closer to home<em>—</em>at your sister, your girlfriends, or your colleagues<em>—</em>and you’ll see a massive cultural shift underway: the rise of the smart, confident young professional woman.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The movement has its trailblazers<em>—</em>Sheryl Sandberg, Arianna 
Huffington, Oprah and Diane Von Furstenberg among others. But its 
strength, increasingly, is coming from the masses: from thousands upon 
thousands of ambitious women entering the workforce and finding that, as
 a culture, we haven’t quite caught up. And we've been there too: being a young woman navigating the professional world for the first time isn't easy. Although as a culture, we’ve left behind the antagonistic, us-versus-them 
mentality of the women's movement of the 70s and 80s, we’ve found the modern refrain that 
“men and women should be indistinct in the workplace” rings hollow, too.
 Call it nature or nuture, there <em>are</em> differences in how men and
 women approach professional conduct, and facing these issues head-on 
will make us all more equipped to succeed.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>That’s why we talk about <a href=""http://dailymu.se/career/boss-of-a-different-gende/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Working with a Boss of a Different Gender</a> or <a href=""http://dailymu.se/career/crying-in-workplace"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">How to Avoid Crying in the Workplace</a>.
 As a culture, we are still trying to create and define the practical 
version of our mothers’ feminism, turning their chorus of “Yes We Can” 
into tangible increases in women holding leadership positions and the 
realization that success is no longer a zero sum game.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>So—welcome to a newly flexible feminism. Welcome to a movement and a space that will define what it means to be a young, intelligent woman in the 21st century. Welcome to the movement. And welcome to <em><a href=""http://dailymu.se/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Daily Muse</a>.</em></p>

<h3>WE WILL HAVE A VIDEO POSTED SHORTLY</h3>
<p>Facebook page and Twitter pages will be up shortly as well.</p>
<p>Nashua NH is also a relative location, the camp will be in that general area.</p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Camp Wolf Den will be an outdoor sports facility specializing in Live Action Role Playing, Airsoft/Paintball and teaching disaster and wilderness survival skills. We are looking to build this site not for profit, but for love of the activities that will take place on them.</p>
<p>In addition the site will play host to a small farm and the home for several caretakers. The site will also be as green as possible, utilizing wind and solar energy as well as participating in recycling programs and things of that nature.</p>
<p>As most of you probably know each of these sports communities have suffered of late due to the high cost of facilities and the poor economy. We seek to address and begin to fix this problem with this site.</p>
<p>So lets all get together and build this site to help revitalize the communities!</p>

<li>Minimal cost of operation means decreased cost to attend events.</li>
<li>Designed for maximum immersion without the site of vehicles and out of game non player characters.</li>
<li>Massive site that will encourage exploration and travel, but still be accesible by anyone with minimal effort.</li>
<li>Games currently to be hosted on site are: Dystopia Rising NH, Degeneration, Empires in Flames, Land in Chaos and Zombie Menace.</li>

<li>All fields are interconnected and open allowing for quick changes in play style and rules with a short walk.</li>
<li>Minimal cost of operation combined with other activities means a minimal cost to use the fields.</li>
</ul>
<div>Teaching Facilities</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Classes ranging from simple outdoor survival to surviving the zombie apocalypse.</li>
<li>Classes range in length from a few hours to several days.</li>
<li>Classes include classroom style teaching and active use of new skills for an optimal learning experience. </li>
<li>Cost of attending classes will be minimal, materials and a small fee to  help with insurance.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars to purchase the land and build everything needed for the facility. All money appropriated will go either towards purchasing land, or purchasing buildings and equipment such as Cabins module spaces and tools.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our funding goal for the project we are still going to use the funds to start up the project. </p>
<p>Funds will be allocated in the following order.</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchase of land.</li>
<li>Development of land.</li>
<li>Buildings.</li>
<li>Green energy utilities.</li>
<li>Tools and equipment needed for day to day operations.</li>
</ul>
<div>Once everything is built and ready to use we will be able to host events for LARP games at a cost of Thirteen Hundred dollars or less based on insurance. For Airsoft and Paintball players we will be able to offer use of the fields at a cost of only Ten to Fifteen dollars per day per person. For those seeking education in survival we will be able to ofer classes at a cost of Thirty to One Hundred Fifty dollars, based on materials needed.</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Once the facility is built this means that the cost of LARPing, attending Airsoft/Paintball events, or learning survival skills will drop in price significantly. The average cost to attend a LARP event these days is up around Seventy Five to Eighty dollars depending on the game and location and that doesn't include food. For Airsoft/Paintball players attending an event can cost upwards of Sixty dollars just for a few hours out in the field.</p>
<p>The goal of these facilities is to drop the cost for LARPers down to around Forty Five dollars for an event at the absolute most. For Airsoft/Paintball Players we will drop the cost of attendance to Ten to Twenty dollars based on insurance.</p>
<p>By supporting this project you will be helping to revitalize the LARP, Airsoft/Paintball communities as a whole and create opportunities for people to learn valuable survival skills.</p>

However, this course of therapy is aggressive and will take its toll. He will be undergoing chemotherapy for six months and it is unlikely that he will be able to work much, if at all, during treatment which could make it a challenging and stressful time for him and his family.

Cameron has been diagnosed with Nodular Lymphocyte Predominant Hodgkin Lymphoma, a rare form of Hodgkin Lymphoma and one that is considered highly treatable. However, this course of therapy is aggressive and will take its toll. He will be undergoing chemotherapy for six months and it is unlikely that he will be able to work much, if at all, during treatment which could make it a challenging and stressful time for him and his family. Because we want to give Cameron the best opportunity for healing and recovery, we have undertaken to raise funds through this campaign to cover their house payments for the six months of his treatment.


Cameron is a musician and a carpenter. Maryke is a theatre artist and technician and works part time for Canada Post. They and their three year old son Harry live in downtown Armstrong BC, in a fixer upper heritage house that they are in the midst of renovating from the ground up.
Those of you who know Cameron and Maryke, understand them to be two of the most generous, hardworking, fun inducing people on the planet, always  ready to get involved in community projects, local (and far flung) fundraisers, and special events. Their longstanding work and volunteerism for Armstrong's Caravan Farm Theatre and Asparagus Theatre have benefitted both organizations, and their community, immensely. Now is the time to show them our support.
Stress and worry about meeting the bills is the last thing anyone needs when they are undergoing chemotherapy. By covering their house payments for the duration of the treatment, we can give Cameron and his family the time and space to focus on healing and recovery. Let's work together to help them through this process.

Any donation, large or small, will be welcome. If we surpass our goal, the extra funds will help with the other costs associated with his treatment, such as supplements and vitamins to address the side effects of the chemotherapy. If you want to leave a message please do. At the campaign's end your messages will be printed on a framed poster and given to Cameron and Maryke. 

If you are interested in other ways of helping, or would like a more hands on way of showing your care, this is what you can do: 
* Contribute professional skills or materials for the work bee to finish the main floor of their house (wiring, drywall, painting, floor sanding), scheduled for late August, early September. 
* Contribute ready-made meals or foodstuffs for their freezer. 

In either case contact his sister Maggie Shook at maggie.shook@gmail.com 

And you can help in a big way by sharing this campaign with others!

<h3>Virginia's Story:</h3>
<p>Virginia Ramos is better known to the people of San Francisco as the beloved Tamale Lady.</p>
<p>In early 90s Virginia realized that her day job as a domestic worker cleaning houses was not earning enough money to send her 7 children to college.</p>
<p>Virginia learned to make Tamales from her Grandmother when she was growing up in Mexico – so to make extra money she began cooking tamales in her kitchen after her house cleaning work was done. During the evening she would fill an insulated cooler with her delicious tamales and travel from bar to bar selling a hot home cooked meals to hungry folks all over San Francisco.</p>
<p>Virginia is often referred to as an angel, a saint, or our Lady of the Tamales not just because she seems to miraculously appear when nightlife patrons need something to eat the most – but because she is known for her hugs, a shoulder to cry on, and her role as a surrogate grandmother to the people of the Mission – in fact she often wears a t-shirt that says “I don’t know you but I love you”.</p>

You'll also see how awesome it is you got in on a fantastic event deal or telling your friends about the great organic produce you just picked up from your named tree!<br/><br/><h1>I'll try to be Brief...</h1>We want to establish a Permaculture farm with an Events Center.  Sound CRAZY?! Maybe, but we're all in and up for the challenge if you are! Even the local news thought it was a good idea, though! <a href=""http://www.krem.com/news/Clayton-couple--221564671.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.krem.com/news/Clayton-couple--221564...</a><br/><br/>When you watch the video you'll get a sense of who we are but we'd like to tell you a little more about our experience here.  We created Siemen Family Farms about five years ago to sell fresh, organic produce to our local co-op and small restaurants from our small, Urban Farm in the heart of Spokane, Wa. We've been working that land using Permaculture Principles with success where no one thought anything would grow!  Now we're ready to do the same thing on a larger scale and involve more people. <br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/17904/files/20130817141927-2013-06-01_15.38.32.jpg?1376774367"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/17902/files/20130817141917-2013-06-01_15.38.40.jpg?1376774357"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The concept we connect with most in Permaculture is that no single thing is the key to success - it's all things working together that make the whole work and produce.  With that, we have a handful of talented friends to share in this experience, and we want to invite you, too.<br/></p>
<br/><h1>Here’s how the Money works!</h1>We need $26,000 to get this thing rolling. We’re doing the work. What we need is help with the materials – 12-20 gallons of paint, carpet &amp; padding, renting a carpet cleaner, wood stain, hog panel fencing and posts, greenhouse sheeting, orchard stock, perennial shrubs and flowers, etc. The best way to do that is to pre-buy something you may already be getting anyway!<br/><br/>That pays for some much needed upgrades on the event facility.  For example, the Bridal Cottage - a single bedroom additional house on the property - needs a good cleaning (which we can do for free) new padding and carpet, new paint, wallpaper removed, refinishing of cupboards, maybe even granite counter tops, and a new refrigerator. <br/><br/>There are some fixes needed on the main facility, too. For example, pigeons have moved into a corner of the metal roof.  The main doors need to be refinished on the outside from sun damage and the French doors on the main patio need to be replaced or refinished as well as the tongue and groove facing on the outside of them.<br/><br/>The groom's room is another space that needs help - right now it's a concrete floor. Seriously, there's a building but it's a concrete floor. Because we're creative, we can definitely work with that but paint, shelving, some overstuffed furniture, maybe a simple bar and TV would be nice while waiting for your big moment.  We'd also quadruple the use of the space for conferences, rehearsals, overnighters, retreats, etc.  <br/><br/>Some ideas for the future include using the one thing besides sunshine there's a lot of and that's the breeze.  Small wind generators are inexpensive to build, unobtrusive, and passively lower the cost of utilities all year round and that just makes sense for everyone. :-)<br/><br/><h1>May I draw your Attention HERE:</h1>To make you a part of this project, we're offering some unique perks.  All our Perks are Gift-able and Transferable - you'll just need to provide us with their contact information! Also, there's no expiration date on them so if you know you'll be celebrating your 50th wedding anniversary in 10 years, we'll still be there when you're date rolls around!<br/><br/>Because it's <b>WEDDINGS </b>we want to do the most, our biggest ""deal"" is, of course, a wedding.  But not just any wedding - YOUR wedding! It includes the rehearsal and dinner, an officiate, a coordinator, the ceremony and the reception, the cleanup, the tables/chairs/linens, and music with indoor and outdoor spaces for 135 guests the entire time. All that for <b>$1,500!</b> These are fully transferrable, gift-able, and come with no time limits so think fast - dates are based on availability! <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/17911/files/20130817142156-DSC00026.JPG?1376774516"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/>Another of our personal favorites is the <b>""Farm to Table"" Events</b>.  Imagine one long table decked with linens, fine tableware, lights, friends, and most importantly local food prepared by local artisans served under the stars.  It’s more than just dining, it’s the opportunity to meet new people, meet food producers you’ve probably never heard of, and tasting local flavors you may never have been made aware of.  With a good wine a local organic cut of beef you could easily reach $90.00 per plate!  How about $50 and you choose your event from the calendar as it's posted?<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/17917/files/20130817142508-198.JPG?1376774708"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><br/>There's a perk to fit most budgets and wants so, please, enjoy the look and find something different! Also, regardless of the funding level achieved, we'll still be using every dime to build this property and this business and whatever you've bought WILL BE available to you as promised!<br/><br/><h1>Make an Impact</h1>It's easy to say what can't be done and all the reasons why.  It's easy to say it should be done a different way. But who likes listening to naysayers? We raised more than a few eyebrows when we moved into an urban neighborhood with a sketchy crime record.  In seven years every person who visits can't believe our house is here! We didn't listen to the ""Debbie Downers"" then and we won’t now, either.  There's no reason we can't build Eden up there to...and host some really great events in the process!<br/><br/>And we're not bailing on the community we've developed on our Urban Farm, either.  With our Connections at Main Market Co-Op and the Spokane Permaculture Study Group, already rented our home out to folks who want to live the same dream we do in an urban setting.  The tradition will carry on!<br/><br/><h1>Other Ways You Can Help</h1>

The concept we connect with most in Permaculture is that no single thing is the key to success - it's all things working together that make the whole work and produce.  With that, we have a handful of talented friends to share in this experience, and we want to invite you, too.
Here’s how the Money works!We need $26,000 to get this thing rolling. We’re doing the work. What we need is help with the materials – 12-20 gallons of paint, carpet & padding, renting a carpet cleaner, wood stain, hog panel fencing and posts, greenhouse sheeting, orchard stock, perennial shrubs and flowers, etc. The best way to do that is to pre-buy something you may already be getting anyway!That pays for some much needed upgrades on the event facility.  For example, the Bridal Cottage - a single bedroom additional house on the property - needs a good cleaning (which we can do for free) new padding and carpet, new paint, wallpaper removed, refinishing of cupboards, maybe even granite counter tops, and a new refrigerator. There are some fixes needed on the main facility, too. For example, pigeons have moved into a corner of the metal roof.  The main doors need to be refinished on the outside from sun damage and the French doors on the main patio need to be replaced or refinished as well as the tongue and groove facing on the outside of them.The groom's room is another space that needs help - right now it's a concrete floor. Seriously, there's a building but it's a concrete floor. Because we're creative, we can definitely work with that but paint, shelving, some overstuffed furniture, maybe a simple bar and TV would be nice while waiting for your big moment.  We'd also quadruple the use of the space for conferences, rehearsals, overnighters, retreats, etc.  Some ideas for the future include using the one thing besides sunshine there's a lot of and that's the breeze.  Small wind generators are inexpensive to build, unobtrusive, and passively lower the cost of utilities all year round and that just makes sense for everyone. :-)May I draw your Attention HERE:To make you a part of this project, we're offering some unique perks.  All our Perks are Gift-able and Transferable - you'll just need to provide us with their contact information! Also, there's no expiration date on them so if you know you'll be celebrating your 50th wedding anniversary in 10 years, we'll still be there when you're date rolls around!Because it's WEDDINGS we want to do the most, our biggest ""deal"" is, of course, a wedding.  But not just any wedding - YOUR wedding! It includes the rehearsal and dinner, an officiate, a coordinator, the ceremony and the reception, the cleanup, the tables/chairs/linens, and music with indoor and outdoor spaces for 135 guests the entire time. All that for $1,500! These are fully transferrable, gift-able, and come with no time limits so think fast - dates are based on availability! 
Another of our personal favorites is the ""Farm to Table"" Events.  Imagine one long table decked with linens, fine tableware, lights, friends, and most importantly local food prepared by local artisans served under the stars.  It’s more than just dining, it’s the opportunity to meet new people, meet food producers you’ve probably never heard of, and tasting local flavors you may never have been made aware of.  With a good wine a local organic cut of beef you could easily reach $90.00 per plate!  How about $50 and you choose your event from the calendar as it's posted?
There's a perk to fit most budgets and wants so, please, enjoy the look and find something different! Also, regardless of the funding level achieved, we'll still be using every dime to build this property and this business and whatever you've bought WILL BE available to you as promised!Make an ImpactIt's easy to say what can't be done and all the reasons why.  It's easy to say it should be done a different way. But who likes listening to naysayers? We raised more than a few eyebrows when we moved into an urban neighborhood with a sketchy crime record.  In seven years every person who visits can't believe our house is here! We didn't listen to the ""Debbie Downers"" then and we won’t now, either.  There's no reason we can't build Eden up there to...and host some really great events in the process!And we're not bailing on the community we've developed on our Urban Farm, either.  With our Connections at Main Market Co-Op and the Spokane Permaculture Study Group, already rented our home out to folks who want to live the same dream we do in an urban setting.  The tradition will carry on!Other Ways You Can Help

If you're not able to personally contribute, we understand.  But we still could use your help.
Consider posting this campaign to your social media pages - everyone knows someone who could use a good event location sometime in the next 12 months.
""Like"" us on Facebook - www.facebook.com/montlammbelgians - and stay in touch with what's going on that way, too.
For all of you blogger mongers, you could write something complimentary and post a link.
The truth is, if you're on Indiegogo you're probably kind of a creative person anyway so be creative and our many thanks for believing this is a worthy project!",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We are two enthusiastic engineers (one of us in Turkey, one in the US) with education and international experience in energy sector. Energy need increases everyday, opposing to the sources, especially the ones we depend on. Fortunately, we start to gain awareness on environmetal issues.

<p>The dependency of our energy consumption rates on fossil fuels threatens our sustainable energy dreams. Consumption rates increased drastically over the past century. Hopefully, we are exploring the way of solutions to utilization of renewable energy.

<p>Our first project is on ocean current energy. Ocean current energy may be the only reliable renewable energy since it will always present as far as our planet is alive. East coast of the US has one of the most powerful marine drives, Gulf Stream. There are many issues being worked on to overcome difficulties. We know incredible amount of energy is present and <strong>it is extractable</strong>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Phase-1</strong></em> of this project is to be able to start oceanographic studies in candidate areas. Not all turbines can be used everywhere, nor every spot with a fast current speed is viable. As you will see, <em>$350 perk</em> will grant you the results of this work in case you are interested in technical details.</p>
<p><em><strong>Phase-2</strong></em> will be more on the corporate side. We need to keep company alive and keep paying employees during non-profit term in order to finalize planning and construction work before putting turbine into water.</p>
<p><em><strong>Phase-3</strong></em> is likely going to be a public promotion of the installation. Since it is a new technology we need to do test run in order to observe the turbine reliability and environmental impact.</p>
<h3 class=""western"">How Sustainable We Are?</h3>
<p>We are going to use most of the funds for start-up needs for the company: Office and office supplies, personnel, communication and travel expenses. We likely end up being able to hire third party for oceanographic measurements (loan). This will not be a one day measurement, it will probably take a year around to see the changes. <em>$1500</em> perk lets you join us on board around March 2014, in case you are interested (consider your visa and transportation arrangements to meet us in Miami, FL).</p>
<p>Don't reach the goal? The project will likely suffer and postponed for some years...</p>
<h3 class=""western"">Our Children?</h3>
<p>You should be proud of yourself even if you learned about this emerging technology. Now its time to make it real.

<h3>Hi, I am a Mum of two girls one of whom got her first period last June 2011. When I went searching shops etc there was no starter or beginners set that I felt would make the transition from child to Woman easier. So I decided to try myself and have put together a gift that a Mum (or Lone Father) can give to their daughter when she gets her first period.  </h3>
<p>IN the box is a hot water bottle, secret casket, diary, pads, eye mask and pocket tissues, along with a lovely information booklet to help them to understand what is happening to their bodies.  </p>
<p>I have tried to get funding from the bank to help me and even appeared on Dragons Den but after the successful pitch, the investment didn't materialize. So I have successfully brought the product to market and have sales but i need to launch a basic essentials kit as it is a recession so I need to make this affordable to everyone. At present the gift box costs 23.99 but the essentials kit would be under 13 euros.  </p>
<p>I have had a lot of support from people on twitter and Facebook and a wonderful reaction as I have ensured that I spread the word, but the only thing that is holding me back is funding.  </p>
<p>I would be so grateful if you could help me realise my dream and get into the UK market and have a pack that more people can afford. </p>
<p>My incentive for you is that anyone who donates or contributes will be entitled to a discount of 5 euros off any Funky Goddess gift box  I have worked really hard on my own to get to this stage and I also believe that making girls feel a bit better through their teenage years is so important! </p>
<p>If you can't contribute I would be sooo grateful if you could spread the word for me. I have never had money in the first place so the fact that I managed to get this far with no investment is amazing, so I won't let you all down. I plan to have a Thank you party someday for anyone who helps me with this.</p>

We rent our space out for events and also bring people together for our own events around all sorts of things to accomplish our goals (see above).

<h3>What we need.</h3>
<p><span>With so much going on at Mercury Studio, the space needs some upgrades! These changes and additions will allow us to accommodate more coworkers and make us better-equipped to keep hosting community-building events.</span></p>
<p><span>Here is the breakdown of our upgrade goals and costs:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>$3,300 - A better kitchen. Right now, we have a sink, refrigerator, and shelf. We'd like counter space, a dishwasher, cabinets, etc.. Apart from being a better use of space, this would also allow us to host a wider variety of events!</li>
<li>$900 - Two new desk spaces. Once we have a new kitchen, we'll be able to make more space in our coworking room for two new desks! These will allow us to accommodate more coworkers, and also help Mercury Studio become more sustainable.</li>
<li>$3,600 - A new membership for working artists. By re-outfitting our art studio and raising funds to subsidize membership costs, we will introduce 10-15 new  Working Artist Memberships. <span>These members will utilize a collaborative meeting/workspace and participate in solo or group shows in our gallery</span>. They will also be meeting once a month to set and report on professional goals and will be encouraged to teach public workshops in our space. The purpose of this membership is (like a lot of what we do) to help support people as they try to make a living doing what they love.</li>
<li>$2,000 - A sound system and projector for our Back Room. This will not only allow us to more easily host film and live music events, but will also make our space more useful for other Durham businesses and organizations in need of meeting space.</li>
<li>$1,000 - Gallery hanging system. This will allow us to show and change art more easily, help protect our walls, and create a more professional-looking space for our members and showing artists to display their work.</li>
<li>$1,000 - General storage and furniture needs: A locking cabinet for new technology, art and furniture for bathrooms, and a nap area!</li>
</ol>
<p>You might notice that this all adds up to $11,800, which is more than our goal. Well, we're hoping to smash our goal! We'll actually need almost $15000 raised here in order to have what we really need after fees and perk costs. That being said...</p>
<h3>How you can help.</h3>
<p>Obviously, making a contribution of your own is an awesome way to help us with this campaign, but there are other ways you can help us spread the word:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Social Media:</strong> Post the link to this page on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, MySpace, bulletin boards, or your forehead - whatever you use!</li>
<li>
<strong>Personal emails:</strong> Email this campaign link to anyone who you think might be interested in participating. Friends, family, coworkers! We'll never know if they want to help unless someone asks them! Think about it. If you get two people to contribute what you contribute, you've tripled your contribution!</li>
<li>
<strong>Listservs:</strong> Have a neighborhood listserv? A knitting listserv? An any kind of listserv? Send out the link!</li>
<li>
<strong>Community Challenges:</strong> Really want to up the stakes? Issue a challenge to people in your community (office, neighborhood, etc.). Let them know what your contribution is and let them know how much you think your community should be able to raise. Also, let us know if you're doing this and we can come up with a prize for the community who, together, makes the greatest contribution!</li>
</ul>
<p>Since Mercury Studio was just an idea in our brains, we've been blown away by the community support we have received. We wouldn't even exist if it hadn't been for a successful IndieGoGo campaign a year ago. Let's do it again!</p>
<p>So much love, <br/>Katie DeConto and Megan Jones</p>

<div>I'm a small business owner dedicated to the craft of screen printing. I'm asking for your support to help my business grow, and establish a place that can house workshops and provide a space for local Bay Area artists to display work. </div>
<p>I'm currently operating a small print shop out of my garage called All Gold, but I would love to have a space to share the art of screen printing, as well as a gallery to exhibit local artists. Your contribution can help make this possible. </p>

<br/>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Where Your Generous Donation Goes:  </h3> <p>1. Supplies. The community classes will be using ink, paper, emulsion, screens, drying racks and other materials. Your donation will help out with these costs.</p>
<p>2. Equipment. I've saved up over the last  18 months &amp; have most of the large equipment required to run a small shop, but there are a few small pieces missing (heat press, tables, chairs, clamps, fans for ventilation, etc.) </p>
<p>3. The building. Affording to live in the Bay Area is not an easy feat. I'm looking to rent a small shop in Oakland, and would use a portion of the funds collected to help offset the cost of the first and last month's rent. </p>
<p>4. The perks. A good portion of the money raised will go towards materials and shipping costs for the prizes. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Your donation will contribute to the growth of my small shop, and help provide opportunities to the community. PLUS, you'll get some really great prizes. </p>
<p>After the funding is dispersed, I'll be maintaining the cost of running the shop by continuing to print custom orders for customers. </p>

<div>+ One free print workshop per month open to the public</div>
<div>+ Donation-based guest workshops (ie. record club, sewing workshop, baking, specialty cocktails, etc.).</div>
<div>+ Art shows incorporating local Bay Area artists (A great way for local talented to get exposure and sell their work). </div>

</div></div>","What's the Deal:
I'm a small business owner dedicated to the craft of screen printing. I'm asking for your support to help my business grow, and establish a place that can house workshops and provide a space for local Bay Area artists to display work. 
I'm currently operating a small print shop out of my garage called All Gold, but I would love to have a space to share the art of screen printing, as well as a gallery to exhibit local artists. Your contribution can help make this possible. 





  Where Your Generous Donation Goes:   1. Supplies. The community classes will be using ink, paper, emulsion, screens, drying racks and other materials. Your donation will help out with these costs.
2. Equipment. I've saved up over the last  18 months & have most of the large equipment required to run a small shop, but there are a few small pieces missing (heat press, tables, chairs, clamps, fans for ventilation, etc.) 
3. The building. Affording to live in the Bay Area is not an easy feat. I'm looking to rent a small shop in Oakland, and would use a portion of the funds collected to help offset the cost of the first and last month's rent. 
4. The perks. A good portion of the money raised will go towards materials and shipping costs for the prizes. 

Your donation will contribute to the growth of my small shop, and help provide opportunities to the community. PLUS, you'll get some really great prizes. 
After the funding is dispersed, I'll be maintaining the cost of running the shop by continuing to print custom orders for customers. 


+++

So, what community opportunities will you be contributing to?

+ One free print workshop per month open to the public
+ Donation-based guest workshops (ie. record club, sewing workshop, baking, specialty cocktails, etc.).
+ Art shows incorporating local Bay Area artists (A great way for local talented to get exposure and sell their work). 
+ A resource available to the community, and an environment where all kinds of artists will be welcomed.


+++







  I'm broke, how can I help?
If you can't contribute money, but you'd still like to help, no worries! Check out these other ways to show support: 

+ Follow All Gold on Facebook & share the campaign with all the homies
+ Show your support on Instagram

<p><b>I
am very excited about this opportunity to learn from the Terra Madre delegates
about how to expand the good food revolution and then share this experience

<p>Dearest Friends!</p>
<p>My name is Jim Embry and I have been
selected to serve as a USA delegate at Slow Food's <a href=""http://www.salonedelgusto.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Terra Madre and Salone del Gusto</a>
conference in Torino, Italy. Wow! What an honor this is as well as a grand opportunity
for building international relationships. As a delegate I will meet people from 130
countries throughout the world who are passionate about and committed to
sustainable agriculture, cultural preservation and good, clean and fair food for
all. When I return home to Richmond, Kentucky I will share my experience with
my community and continue the work of building the good food revolution here in
the USA. </p>
<p>My goals are to engage in at least
25 community outreach efforts… such as speaking engagements, photo exhibits,
house parties…before I go and after I return to share the Slow Food story and
the remarkable Terra Madre experience. I already have speaking engagements lined
up at universities, community colleges and coffee shops. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Who I am?</b></p>

Two years ago I moved from Lexington
to Richmond to live on a small family farm next to my 90 year old Aunt Bessie who I help provide some care. I have
planted a fruit orchard, a large patch of wild flowers, native plants and
sunflowers for the pollinators and have a large garden of all kinds of goodies.
Since 2006 serving as the founder/director of Sustainable Communities Network (sustainlex.org),
I have helped start 40+ community gardens, trained 400 teachers to create
school gardens, organized annual local food summits and community garden tours,
served on our local climate action plan team and the national planning
committee for the <a href=""http://www.growingpower.org/events.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Growing Food and Justice Gathering</a>. My passion however is providing
gardening, cooking and nutrition support to various women’s groups that serve
women at risk. I work with women who are healing from<a href=""http://www.ket.org/cgi-bin/cheetah/watch_video.pl?nola=kkyli+001913&amp;altdir=&amp;template="" rel=""noopener nofollow""> domestic violence abuse</a>, drug
and alcohol addiction, homelessness, as well as provide support for teen
mothers and their children. In 1972 I was
a founding member of our local food cooperative, so I have been working on the
joy and justice of this good food revolution for a long time.

<p><b>I
Need Your Support With Travel Expenses</b></p>
<p>Your
support will help send me to the conference in Turin, Italy. In return, I will
share Kentucky’s vibrant Slow Food culture with international audiences and
bring back knowledge gathered from folks around the world. </p>
<p>As a delegate my housing and entry
to the Terra Madre event are already paid for, but I need help with the other
travel expenses. I will be attending this amazing event, but also spending time
after in northern Italy visiting schools, farms and cooperatives to gain knowledge
which I can bring back to my community. Your donations will help cover my air
fare and expenses of extended stay in Italy which total about $2500.</p>
<p>Before I go and after I return, I
will be sharing the message of the global sustainable food movement and my
Terra Madre experiences with my community, neighbors, co-workers, friends and
families. All contributors will be invited to a presentation of my travels upon
my return, and each one will receive a thoughtful “thank you” gift that
represents my experiences in Italy.</p>
<p><b>What
is Slow Food?</b></p>
<p>Slow Food is a non-profit,
grassroots membership organization that was founded in Italy in 1986 as a response
to fast food and fast-food culture. It has grown into an international
organization with more than 150,000 members in 150 countries. Slow Food
strives to link the pleasures of the table with a commitment to protect the
community, culture, knowledge and environment that make this pleasure possible.</p>
<p>Kentucky has a three active Slow
Food chapters, Slow Food Bluegrass, Slow Food Lexington and Slow Food UK. In
addition, our state has a <a href=""http://www.kyproud.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kentucky Proud </a>program and a robust community of
support for sustainable agriculture, good food and independent, local family
farmers. </p>
<p>When my 90 year old aunt asked me “Jimmy you are
going to Italy…well what is slow food?” I responded and said “Aunt Bessie, slow
food is what you have been doing as a small farmer your entire life!”</p>
<p><b><u>Other Ways to Provide Support</u></b></p>
<p>I know that some of you might want
to help financially but cannot do so at this time, and I appreciate that! But
consider these other ways to support my efforts to bring the Terra Madre experience
back home to Kentucky and the USA. After the Terra Madre gathering, I will be
visiting local farms, schools and businesses near Torino to maximize my
learning experience which I will share when I return home. My goal is to engage
in at least 25 community outreach activities designed to share my Terra Madre
experience with others, fulfill my responsibility as a delegate and continue to
build on the joy
and justice of <a href=""http://www.slowfoodusa.org/themes-and-events#theme1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.slowfoodusa.org/themes-and-events#theme1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">good, clean and fair food</a><span>  in my local

</p><p></p><h3>The Purpose</h3><p>So, you may be asking:</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><b>Why are you going there?</b></i></p>
<p>As a photographer and videographer, I love finding new opportunities and unique ways to tell people’s stories - and here I am able to not just <i>share</i> their story, but support their cause and their future. By creating a video for CFG that tells <i>their story </i>with beauty and clarity, they then have a new tool to use when pursuing future funding and outreach opportunities. </p>
<p>
</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><b>What is Global Populace trying to do?</b></i></p>
<p><span>Global Populace connects storytellers with social brands to produce meaningful stories of impact around the world. With Global Populace, if a storyteller can crowdfund significant donations for a cause that the brand and storyteller are both passionate about, the brand rewards the storyteller with a travel grant to visit the cause and produce a story about the positive impact the crowdfunding has made.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b><i>Why CFG?</i></b></p>
<p>Global Populace first began working with CFG during a scouting trip in Southeast Asia last year and as a result I now have the opportunity to connect to and advocate on behalf of just a few of the projects that CFG has under way. </p>
<p>
</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b><i>What will the $3,000 go towards?</i></b></p>
<p>CFG’s director, Phyu Cyn, created a detailed list of what the money will be used for (which you can find below) - that includes the construction of two new roofs, a support pillar, and two and a half months worth of food including rice, meat, veggies, oil, etc for the nearly 30 children that their center supports.</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><b>Why not just give the money for your trip to CFG?</b></i></p>
<p>Much like marathon runners who raise money for a cause are rewarded by a Brand with a trip to a marathon, I am being sponsored by Mizuba Tea to document the impact of the money raised for this project - this documentary trip is my race. This not only helps donors like yourself see where all your money is going, but it helps spread the word about causes and projects like CFG, as the video I create will be used by CFG, Mizuba Tea, Global Populace and myself - making it available and known to numerous networks of new people, new ideas, and new opportunities. </p>
<p>
</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><i><b>Who is the Brand Sponsor and what do they get out of it?</b></i></p>
<p>Mizuba Tea is a small tea company that directly sources its tea products from Japan and works to maintain close, honest relationships with their tea farmers. As my Global Populace Brand Sponsor, Mizuba Tea will have the opportunity to use the video and photos that I create telling CFG’s story for conscious brand marketing - helping to tell CFG’s story and why its important for Brands to work towards positive social impact.</p>

<p>We are a group of 3 American volunteers seeking funding for a group of 12 to 15, poor farmers in Bohicon,
Benin, West Africa.  This group owns 2 hectares of land south of Bohicon and proposes to create an irrigated
farm for growing vegetables.  An
irrigated farm makes a good profit because of seasonal price fluctuations in
the price of vegetables.  The price of
most vegetables doubles to quintuples at the height of the dry season (February
to April) compared to the price during the height of the wet season (July to
September).  With an irrigated farm,
crops are produced during the dry season, and command the superior price.  There are few irrigated farms in the area
because of the cost of the infrastructure for irrigating, namely a well of 70
to 80 meters (around 220 feet), a pump, generator, pipeline and an elevated
(approximately 9 feet) water tank. 
Because this group of farmers is very poor, they are also raising money
for tools, seeds and fertilizer.  They
are applying for a USAID Food Security Grant for the tools, seeds, training, and fertilizer.  This

The
group plans to grow:  tomatoes, hot peppers,
gboman (a dark green, leafy vegetable), carrots, okra, and lettuce. They also plan to grow moringa trees. Moringa leaves are a highly nutritional leaf that can supplement nutrient poor diets in Benin, but supply is small.  All of these crops are presently grown in the
Bohicon area, and these farmers are familiar with their cultural
practices.  The water table is
approximately 80 meters.  They will need
a pump that can produce 13.5 gal. per minute from approximately 260 feet and a
generator that can power a pump of that capacity, which is why the pump and
generator is fairly expensive.  This
should give them adequate water for 2 ½ to 5 acres of irrigated crops.  This investment (both the Indiegogo and the
USAID grants) has an estimated internal rate of return of more than 50%.  The group plans to use the profits from this

</p><p>
</p><p>Bonjour!</p>
<p>My
name is Kenel Pierre. I grew up in Haiti with my family in the town of Hinche.
Growing up I watched my parents and their neighbors work
hard to grow enough food for us to eat with little left over to sell at
the market. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433970577/xl9sqge2pggdemxlhocp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The soil was rocky and impacted by extreme flooding and
dry seasons, as well as de-forestation.  My father’s only tool was
a machete.  One day, when I was seventeen, he was killed in a farm
related accident and our precarious life was made even more difficult. At
this time my aunt, helped me to get into a high school in Hinche where I cared
for the younger boys in an orphanage in exchange for room and board. 
Through the orphanage I was able to attend a semester of college where I
studied  agronomy. I
had to leave the university for financial reasons but I moved on to work at an
organization called Midwives For Haiti as a Creole teacher and translator. Here
I met many good friends, including my dear American friend Sarah Taylor. Sarah
was an volunteer at Midwives For Haiti from Portland, Oregon who was in Haiti
to help deliver babies and teach midwifery. </p>
<p>Through the orphanage and Midwives for Haiti, I met
many other people who taught me English and offered me hope for both
myself and my country.  They told me that my  country was once the
richest colony in the world with so much food and many natural
resources.  They also told me that the first people were killed
by Christopher Columbus and replaced by my ancestors from Africa, who were
forced to work on plantations until they fought for their freedom and
won.  Decades of corruption, exploitation of the land and invasions
left my country’s top soil in the sea, thousands dead and a proud people
unable to grow enough food to feed their families.  Hunger, malnutrition
cause one child in four to die before they reach the age of five.
 Despite the efforts of many, my country is still the poorest nation in
the western hemisphere.  And yet it is my home; the place of my
family, my ancestors, familiar songs and much beloved landscapes.  I
love my country and want to see her reclaim  the glory that was once hers. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433970729/jlo3kenplhptqmm5glbn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Many of my
friends in Haiti are farmers and I have spent a lot of time with them seeing
what they do and learning from them. After a while I realized that since they
had not gone to school for agriculture, there was much missing from their
knowledge of how to farm and how to take care of the land. I decided I wanted
to become a farmer and a teacher so I could help the people of Hinche and the
people of Haiti to farm better and to take better care of their land. So, when
I met Sarah Taylor I explained to her my situation: how I would love to be a
farmer and teach other farmers but did not have any real opportunity to be
trained in the knowledge I needed to fulfill this dream. She knew of a program
at Oregon State University and other farming resources in her hometown of
Portland, Oregon in the United States. She shared my story with her friends and
asked for help finding a way for me to gain the knowledge I needed to help
Haitian farmers. She talked to many of her friends at Oregon State University,
and together they created a scholarship for me to study agriculture through
Oregon State University in Portland.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433972946/vos85b7bvdbusv4oywgs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3><b>What I want to do for my community in Haiti</b></h3>
<p>Studying agriculture provides me with the knowledge and understanding to contribute directly to the
sustainable production of quality food for people, fiber for manufacturing,
seed, and bioenergy crops. Working to improve agriculture is a key element in
the effort to feed the world's growing population; crops play an ever-growing
role in renewable energy production. Healing the land and producing local food
in Haiti is of utmost importance to me. In my community I want to be at the
forefront of a movement to take back the land, to rebuild its ecology and to
create a truly local food system. I am so glad I have had this opportunity in Portland to become
a true farmer and I am ready to go back home to Hinche in November of this year
to help everybody in that community who is interested in growing their own
food.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433972892/qtxrdbevz1batl1jak54.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>When I return to
Haiti this September, I want to open a center for learning in Hinche where I will teach people
about growing food and taking care of the land. The center will be a
demonstration farm with a focus on teaching gardening, food security, and
sustainable farming to the community of Hinche through many different learning
activities, workshops, and community projects. My community of Hinche, and Haiti
as a whole, is in need of much help with their food systems and education
related to growing food. I want to use this learning center as a model farm to
teach not only children, but all of the people in my community how to more
sustainably grow food and other crops so we can start to repair our food system
and countryside. In order to see these ideas manifest, I need your help. I do
not have the funds to start this project, so I am asking all of you, my American
friends, and friends of my American friends, to help me fund this project in
any way you can. </p><h3>What I need to realize this dream</h3>
<p>To realize this dream when I
return to Haiti in September, I need to raise at least $18,000 to get started
on a few tangible things in my community:</p>
<ul>
<li>$5,000 to rent or buy a
     small plot of land in Hinche on which to create my small demonstration
     farm and learning center.</li>
<li>$5,000 for a second-hand
     truck, which will enable me to carry supplies and to drive women to the
     market to sell their food on market day.  Currently they walk
     many hours to sell a few things and then walk back. I want to help
     these folks and be able to transport goods and and training materials in
     my community.</li>
<li>$5,000
     to build a small house and a classroom area so I can teach the people of
     Hinche sustainable farming and gardening practices.</li>
<li>$3,000
     for gardening supplies, including seeds, hand tools, a roto-tiller or
     tractor, irrigation equipment, and water catchment systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>With your help to raise funds for these items, I
believe I can make a real change in the way the people of Hinche farm, eat, and
think about their land. I will do everything I can to see this project come to
life. Through hard work and the support of my friends, I will be able to
expand the garden into a small demonstration site with regular classes and
workshops.  It is my hope that your small investment will offer you
the joy of knowing farmers are able to feed their children three meals a
day and pay for their school. It is an investment in a smile and good help
for a small country with a big heart. </p><p>
</p><p>I
will be hosting and leading small service groups in my town of Hinche in the
coming years, with our first trip scheduled for early December of this year. These
groups will focus on planting small orchards for
schools and workshops for small rural villages, like theone
I grew up in. If you are interested in these trips, please find me on Facebook
or email me at Pierrekenel13@gmail.com</p>
<p>Please
share this campaign with all of your friends through email, Facebook, or in
person. We need your help to get the word out on this project!</p>

I met Sarah Taylor I explained to her my situation: how I would love to be a
farmer and teach other farmers but did not have any real opportunity to be
trained in the knowledge I needed to fulfill this dream. She knew of a program
at Oregon State University and other farming resources in her hometown of
Portland, Oregon in the United States. She shared my story with her friends and
asked for help finding a way for me to gain the knowledge I needed to help
Haitian farmers. She talked to many of her friends at Oregon State University,
and together they created a scholarship for me to study agriculture through
Oregon State University in Portland.What I want to do for my community in Haiti
Studying agriculture provides me with the knowledge and understanding to contribute directly to the
sustainable production of quality food for people, fiber for manufacturing,
seed, and bioenergy crops. Working to improve agriculture is a key element in
the effort to feed the world's growing population; crops play an ever-growing
role in renewable energy production. Healing the land and producing local food
in Haiti is of utmost importance to me. In my community I want to be at the
forefront of a movement to take back the land, to rebuild its ecology and to
create a truly local food system. I am so glad I have had this opportunity in Portland to become
a true farmer and I am ready to go back home to Hinche in November of this year
to help everybody in that community who is interested in growing their own
food.
When I return to
Haiti this September, I want to open a center for learning in Hinche where I will teach people
about growing food and taking care of the land. The center will be a
demonstration farm with a focus on teaching gardening, food security, and
sustainable farming to the community of Hinche through many different learning
activities, workshops, and community projects. My community of Hinche, and Haiti
as a whole, is in need of much help with their food systems and education
related to growing food. I want to use this learning center as a model farm to
teach not only children, but all of the people in my community how to more
sustainably grow food and other crops so we can start to repair our food system
and countryside. In order to see these ideas manifest, I need your help. I do
not have the funds to start this project, so I am asking all of you, my American
friends, and friends of my American friends, to help me fund this project in
any way you can. What I need to realize this dream
To realize this dream when I
return to Haiti in September, I need to raise at least $18,000 to get started
on a few tangible things in my community:

$5,000 to rent or buy a
     small plot of land in Hinche on which to create my small demonstration
     farm and learning center.
$5,000 for a second-hand
     truck, which will enable me to carry supplies and to drive women to the
     market to sell their food on market day.  Currently they walk
     many hours to sell a few things and then walk back. I want to help
     these folks and be able to transport goods and and training materials in
     my community.
$5,000
     to build a small house and a classroom area so I can teach the people of
     Hinche sustainable farming and gardening practices.
$3,000
     for gardening supplies, including seeds, hand tools, a roto-tiller or
     tractor, irrigation equipment, and water catchment systems.

With your help to raise funds for these items, I
believe I can make a real change in the way the people of Hinche farm, eat, and
think about their land. I will do everything I can to see this project come to
life. Through hard work and the support of my friends, I will be able to
expand the garden into a small demonstration site with regular classes and
workshops.  It is my hope that your small investment will offer you
the joy of knowing farmers are able to feed their children three meals a
day and pay for their school. It is an investment in a smile and good help
for a small country with a big heart. 
I
will be hosting and leading small service groups in my town of Hinche in the
coming years, with our first trip scheduled for early December of this year. These
groups will focus on planting small orchards for
schools and workshops for small rural villages, like theone
I grew up in. If you are interested in these trips, please find me on Facebook
or email me at Pierrekenel13@gmail.com
Please
share this campaign with all of your friends through email, Facebook, or in
person. We need your help to get the word out on this project!
Thank you so much!

<p>My name is Mukisa Rock and I am heading this project. I was born in Uganda and have
lived in Masaka town or nearby villages all my life. I am now 23 years of age.
It has always been a dream of mine to have my own land to farm and start a
business in the community. I come from family that never had land or a
house of their own. To get something to eat was a blessing from God. As a
child, I would go steal mangos and other food to eat in order to survive. According

the life that my family was and is still living.</p>
<p>Most people do not want anything to do with farming. You
have to be patient and work hard. However, I see many possibilities in farming because
you can grow food, rear animals, and almost everything that is planted is on
the market. This is how I want to eradicate poverty in my community. I can
fight poverty and hunger in my family and country through this farming project.
We already have land ready to be purchased and planted, but need is some help
to get started. Together we can provide a food supply for this village, create
employment, help eradicate poverty, and develop sustainable agricultural practices
that can eventually be used in other communities as well. Join us in this

<p>The American economy has crumbled. Who better to rebuild it than those who have already served to protect it? We Serve Again is a challenge to our veterans to keep serving their country through entrepreneurship and engagment in their communities. </p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2><strong>#How Your Contribution Helps:</strong></h2>
<p>Your contribution will jumpstart the recovery by making all of the resources which are availabe to those who have served easy to access and utilise.</p>
<p>Your contribution will also help to restore lost dignity to those veterans sufferring from unemployment. </p>
<p>Finally, your contribution will go a long way towards making veterans more employable by breaking down the language barriers that exist between the military, the education system, and businesses.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>#More About We Serve Again</h2>
<p>We Serve again shall be an interactive and engaging website that will be a continually updated portal of information for veterans, their families, and businesses who might not know about the benefits of working with those who have served. </p>
<p>Big corporations tend to hire people based on their resumes, not their actual life experience, and that tends to keep vets, who have highly specialized skill sets, from getting employed by those companies. We Serve Again is to bridge that gap by challenging veterans to seek out new opportunities and ventures, and to simultaneously showcase their skills to businesses that may not have thought about hiring someone with a non-traditional life path. </p>

<h2>#About Jason Green</h2>
<p>I’m a Navy Veteran who’s suffered the woes of unemployment twice, and I understand the helplessness that accompanies it. The second time was the worst. I'd completed my college degree and yet I could not find employment for 6 months. To go from leading a division of nuclear reactor operators in the Navy to getting that degree, but being unemployed, was humiliating.</p>
<p>Had I known about the tools available to me, I would have spent my time building a business instead of waiting for a phone call. Rather than toiling in anguish over what I should be doing with my life, and feeling like it was on pause, I could have been taking control of my life. I could have been <em>living</em>.</p>
<p>I don't want this to happen to anyone else. We Serve Again will be a one-stop shop that is heavily advertised to ensure that the message is out there for the rest of our country's veterans.</p>
<p>Unemployment sucks, so I developed this challenge as a way to give an answer to both veteran unemployment and our weakened economy.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>#Join the Fight</h2>
<p><span>A war isn't won with just its soldiers. Behind them is a vast network of support. Join the fight for our economy today by contributing to the cause. </span></p>
<p>To get <em>We Serve Again</em> up and running, you can pledge anything -- from the cost of a movie ticket all the way up to a $5,000 sponsorship.</p>
<p>For just $25, you can help this project by leaving your own words of advice, encouragement, or thanks. These messages will be trickled out slowly through blog posts and videos so as to have maximum impact.</p>

<p>My name is JD. I have a birth mother named Jan. Jan lives in Connecticut. My family in Connecticut is a working class family, and nothing has ever been easy. I was a ward of the state and separated from my family until 1996. I have three brothers and one sister. All of them lost their birth father when they were young (he died of heart failure). My birth mother Jan worked many jobs and struggled hard to raise her four children. She eventually re-married to an auto mechanic named Jim. All of the children in our family are of adult age now, but thing aren't any easier these days then they were in the 1990's or the 2000's. </p>
<p>Jan lost her current husband. He died quickly, in just two weeks time. He spent that time in the ICU and left a $30,000 hospital bill. Then he left a $5,000 funeral bill. If that wasn't enough, Jan also lost her youngest son (my brother) Zach. When Zach died, there was another $5,000 funeral bill.</p>
<p>Jan works hard and lives with assistance. In this broken economy she can't get full time hours, and works as many hours as she can. All of my remaining siblings struggle to keep themselves above water, and even with all of our help, this burden of debt is too much for Jan to climb out of without help from other families who can understand how oppressive these organizations are and how impossible it is for poor families to get out of debts like this. With interest and fees over the past few years, it brings tears to the eyes. As long as the hospitals, collection agencies and funeral homes want their money (which they are entitled to), Jan can't get closure and move on with her life, and cope with the pain of losing both her husband and her son. </p>
<p>Put simply, we're asking for America and the World to help us achieve a donation amount of $40,000 to put this burden down once and for all. We are asking for your help. $100, $20, $10, $5, $1, even 25 cents would help get closer to eliminating the bills from these tragedies and helping the family start healing. We are not a special family, so many families have hardship like this and live in a time when the economy is frightening and the future is frightening for all of us. Please help us, and we wish to pay it forward by helping other families who are suffering in just this same way. There are many famlies who need help, but this time it is our family's cry out for assistance.</p>
<p>If just 2,000 people donated $20.00 we would meet our goal. If just 4,000 people donated $10.00 we would meet our goal. We are asking you to spread the word for us, please. We are asking for you to make a donation of any amount, please.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Lauren and Wesley Wright are raising funds to finish the United Hearts Sustainable Fish Pond!  United Hearts is a community based project located in Awutu Bawjiase, Ghana. We believe that through supporting our local children, we will create a self sufficient community of healthy, educated adults committed to the future development of Bawjiase. </p>
<p>Lauren's Story: Lauren has spent over 9 months is Bawjiase, and is the Volunteer Coordinator for United Hearts, and a Global Advocate for Mama Hope.  She has raised almost $40,000 through the amazing help of family and friends, for the new United Hearts Orphanage Facility, and for other sustainable projects.  The children and staff at United Hearts have completely changed her life, and she is fully committed to doing everything she can to connect them with the resources they need to support themselves and the community.</p>
<p>Wesley's Story: Wesley had the opportunity to visit  United Hearts during his spring break in 2011, and had a wonderful experience. He will be returning this summer for seven weeks, and can hardly wait to get there. Wesley is commited to seeing the fishpond completed, and believes in the future sustainability of United Hearts.</p>
</div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise the last $1,500 in order to finish the Fish Pond when we return to Bawjiase on May 20th.  The first portion of the money for the fish pond was raised through <a href=""http://wishes.causes.com/wishes/445295?bws=fb_stream_wish"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Lauren's Birthday Wish"">Lauren's Birthday Wish</a>, and a portion of <a href=""http://wishes.causes.com/wishes/458077?bws=email_to_friends&amp;m=70d4eb40"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Georgia's Birthday Wish"">Georgia Goonewardene's Birthday Wish</a>.  The total cost of the project is $5,000, which provides the following:</p>
<p>-A plot of land where we will dig two fish ponds, one for Tilapia, and one for Mudfish.</p>
<p>- Labor costs for digging these ponds and a well, which will be used to periodically pump clean water into the ponds</p>
<p>- Fencing materials, nets, tilapia and mudfish fingerlings, and food for the fish for 6 months (before they are sold)</p>
<p>-A separate maintenence fund in case we face unforseen issues with the project.</p>
<p>To read the full project proposal with the exact breakdown of the project timeline, materials, and costs, email Lauren at <a href=""mailto:info@unitedheartsghana.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">info@unitedheartsghana.org</a>.</p>
<p>Through contributing to this cause, you get the satisfaction of knowing that you are creating a source of sustainable income for an amazing community!  You can also receive updates on the progress of this project, through checking out the <a href=""http://www.unitedheartsghana.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""United Hearts"">United Hearts Blog</a>!</p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We expect that after 6 months, the fish will be ready to sell and eat.  This will allow United Hearts contribute to the local economy, through selling the fish to restaurants and our supporters in the area.  It will also supplement the children's dietary needs, because tilapia and mudfish are a staple of the Ghanaian diet.  After using some of our revenue to reinvest in this sustainable project, we expect to have a total of over 2,700 GHS in profit.  This is enough to feed the children and staff at United Hearts for over 3 months.  </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Brownies To Remember is our creation based on what we love to do and who we are inspired to help. We are a Mother/Daughter team who are combining ideas and talents to bring Brownies To Remember to life after the passing of our Mother/Grandmother and her sisters from Alzheimer's disease.</p>
<p>There are currently 5.4 million Americans living with Alzheimer's giving most of us at least a basic awareness of what it is. What a lot of us may be surprised to hear is that it is the 6th leading cause of death in the U.S. and the only cause of death that cannot be prevented, cured or slowed.</p>
<p>We want to do something about that, however, we are not doctors nor are we qualified to conduct research. We are just two ladies who love to bake from scratch and have some amazing brownies! So, our goal is to turn Brownies To Remember into a specialty bakery and website offering brownies, brownie cakes and other baked goods including vegan and gluten free varieties that donates <strong>20% of the profits to the Alzheimer's Research Center</strong> in St. Paul, Minnesota which recently received national attention for their development on an intranasal insulin spray that improves memory.</p>
<p>What qualifies us to operate a bakery?</p>
<p>Brenda, aka Mom, has almost 30 years of experience in baking including successfully owning and operating 3 other bakeries. Her knowledge of the food service industry and baking on a large scale is key to the success of any bakery.</p>
<p>Elysia, aka Daughter, has been raised with a love of baking, been schooled in the business and accounting fields and has over 10 years combined retail and accounting experience.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>While we have funding in place to cover equipment, we are still in need to cover the cost of construction to bring the location to code. This includes a fire suppression system, brand new men and women's restrooms, plumbing, electric and installation of a ventilation hood. Our goal is $50,000. Anything above our goal will be used on the starting supplies to make those incredible brownies! In the unfortunate event we do not reach our goal, the funds will still be used toward construction and/or supplies.</p>
<p>Though it may seem a lot to choose a location needing so much done, our chosen location is key to the success of Brownies To Remember. We are working with the developer of a seniors apartment complex which has available retail space on the first floor. The complex and surrounding area has numerous medical facilities and retailers that would make perfect customers or affiliates. The cherry on top is that Barberton is known for a strong community bond and support of senior citizens and their needs.</p>
<p>While EVERY donation gets our eternal appreciation, we will offer the perks listed on the right along with a personal thank you to those designated donations. What better way to not only thank you but show you what you have helped create by giving brownies!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Enjoy a brownie. Fund research for Alzheimer's. It's that simple. Brownies To Remember is making a pledge to donate <strong>20% of our profits to Alzheimer's research</strong> giving you one more reason to treat yourself and feel good about it!</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Sure, I need to raise money for myself, but there is something about Ms. Tonya Burrell that has sparked an extreme desire to help launch her business.  Ms. Tonya exemplifies what every entrepreneur should have and that is love and true heart.  She has to be one of the most amazing bakers/chefs that I have ever met.  Her giving spirit and the love that she puts into her food and presenting her food and pastries to others is something that more and more people should experience.  Even when she should be thinking of herself she is constantly supporting and promoting others on a daily basis.  Helping Ms. Tonya to launch her business would be a blessing to many people.  She is the creator of the most amazing cupcakes and cakes in all different shapes and sizes.  It is amazing to me to see how much she gives away for free when she really should be charging and that to me shows that she truly loves and believes in what she does and in turn causes others to believe.</p>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold;"">Impact</span></p>
</div><div><p>Helping Ms. Tonya to Raise this money will make a difference in the lives of so many people.  Additionally Ms. Tonya would be able to reach more people and book in venues because she will be able to afford the license that she needs to serve food in public.</p></div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order for Ms. Tonya to fully launch her business to more people, she needs to be licensed.  Being a single parent with one income,  the close to $450.00 that she needs to pay for the license is not an easy amount to come up with.  Additionally, she will need funds for marketing materials and products $500.00,</p>
<p>$150.00 for website - which include domain registration and web hosting for several years and build.</p>
<p>$3500.00 for a used van that she found which can be used for deliveries and transporting of her products.</p>
<p>$500 for additional baking supplies which include the ever popular request by the people who have tasted her cupcakes, shipping supplies.  <br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Spread the word about this campaign to help Ms. Tonya Burrell.  Although this has Ms. Tonya as the administrator, the idea and all the info was conceived by DeeWorks.  I truly believe in Ms. Tonya and trust that you will too once you have experienced the love and passion that she puts into her food and pastries. </p>

<p>My name is Brian Richards, I am 26 years old and a Northern California native, born in San Francisco, raised in Marin County and Davis and currently living in Sacramento.  I have worked as a screen printer in three different shops around Davis and Sacramento over the last seven years, including my last position as the lead printer/designer for a soccer company's print operation.</p>
<p>My roommate and I began building this business just over a year ago by purchasing equipment and supplies online and creating a screen printing studio out of the garage of the house we had been renting.  We set aside about $2K each of our student loans over the course of two semesters ($8K total) while we were attending Sacramento State in order to build the company to where it is today.  </p>
<p>Our clients have mostly been friends and fellow students from Sacramento State, as we have printed shirt orders for many different clubs and organizations affiliated with the school over the past year, here are just a few: Martial Arts Club, Sign Language Club, Public Relations Student Society, Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, Optometry Club, Parks &amp; Rec Majors, Xi Phi Chi Fraternity.  We have also been involved with several other clients, mostly through friends and word of mouth.</p>
<p>This summer, just weeks after I graduated (finally) from Sac State, and with the help and generosity of my Grandma and her husband, I was able to finance a move into the beautiful Land Park neighborhood of Sacramento, where I have just opened up my own storefront in an old commercial building across the street from McClatchy high school and down the block from Sacramento City College.</p>
<p>The next few months are crucial to the success of the company.  I have several friends willing to dedicate their time and effort to help me, but I am in need of some available capital to ensure the company's survival by obtaining a few more design programs and small pieces of equipment.  With the help of indiegogo and those willing to take a chance on our future, I believe this company will grow into a permanent Land Park fixture and soon could be expanding into the job creator that the surrounding area desperately needs.  Thank you for you help, I deeply appreciate it, this has been a dream of mine for a long time.</p></div>","Wildcard Screen Printing Co.

<p>Dear Friend,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>    As an aspiring philanthropist, I believe that it is our obligation to do right by others. This not only includes the members of our neighborhood, our places of worship or our workplace; but also the members of our global community. It is only with the success of a functional global community that true freedom and prosperity can strive.</p>
<p>    Along with a prosperous society, comes a great deal of responsibility. A duty to uphold the rights and freedoms of others is extremely crucial. However, with responsibility comes expectations, and it is with those expectations that we must tread carefully. We must ensure that we will not make promises that we cannot entirely keep.</p>
<p>   I have made a promise to my community; to people in need and to myself. I have made a promise that will undoubtedly change lives for the better. This promise is most certainly attainable, but as a commonly quoted phrase states, “It takes a village to raise a child.”</p>
<p>    As a part of my village, my community, I am asking you to assist me in keeping my promise to the children of Uganda. This fall I will travel to their home in Bugembe and work alongside them as a mentor and a friend. Stephen and Dinah Wante opened their home to these children, whose parents have passed as a result of genocide or AIDS. While at El Shadai Foster Home, the 30 children attend school, learn to be self-sustainable and are cared for by two loving guardians; “Uncle Stephen &amp; Auntie Dinah”. These children are a beacon of hope for others in the darkness that often grips rural Africa.</p>
<p>    It is my hope that you will stand up with me today. It is the children’s hope that you will take action against poverty and injustice. Together we can build the foundation of a better future for all of our brothers and sisters. There are more than 2 million orphans (18 and under) in Uganda. We may not be able to save all the children of the world, but we can definitely make a huge difference in the lives of those at El Shadai.</p>

<p><strong>WELCOME TO STARGAZER</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>The tap room is furnished with dark woods, the lights are low and a warm fire crakles in a near by fireplace. There is an open sky light, allowing the beauty of the night sky to shine through. Picturesque photographs of cosmic themed artwork decorate the interior. You are welcomed by bright smiles as if you were long, lost family. “Come on in! We’re glad to see you tonight!”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>STATEMENT OF PURPOSE</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>We currently reside in Grand Rapids, Michigan but will soon be relocating to Corvallis, Oregon. This is a new business in the start-up phase.  Stargazer Brewing will be a small scale microbrewery that will be located in Corvallis, Oregon.  Oregon leads the nation in breweries per capita and due to certain tax advantages available only to microbrewers, it is a profitable business to be in. “Dozens of varieties of hops are grown in Oregon's valleys, grains from the highlands are raised for the malt and there are even some of the top labs making brewers yeasts, right in Oregon.” (Oregon.com) It is for these reasons and many more that Oregon is the ideal state for microbrewers seeking to start their own business.</p>
<p> What is a microbrewery? A microbrewery is defined as one that brews less than 20,000 barrels per year. Stargazer Brewing plans to start production at 2,000 barrels per year, with plans to expand as production demand increases.</p>
<p> This Initial brew rig will give us the capability of producing 1 barrel at a time and will aid in the securing of our brewing licenses. Initial plans are to travel to local festivals, handing out samples of our products, so that we become known in the community.</p>
<p> Our long term plans are to produce two distinct lines of products. One shall be a line of fruit ales, complete with seasonal offerings. These types of beers sell quickly and tend to be quite popular. The second line of products will be a mix of English and Belgian style ales, which appeal to the more seasoned beer connoisseurs. In addition specialty house beers will be brewed and always available on tap. In-house and take-out sales will be offered through our planned on-site tap room. Tours and sampling will also be offered.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>We are currently asking for $10,000 for the purchase of larger brewing equipment, lab equipment, and the purchase of logoed brewery swag. Below is a break down of exactly what we need and the approximate costs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>55 gallon conical fermenter                      $1300</p>
<p>75 gallon boil kettle                                 $1000</p>

<p><strong>OUR </strong><strong>MISSION</strong><strong> STATEMENT</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>Everyone who opens a brewery wants to make great beer; we’re no exception to this. However, in founding this company we realized that we also had an opportunity to determine what <em>kind</em> of business it is that we want to run. After some discussion, we decided that it is necessary for Stargazer Brewing to reflect our values and remain true to them. This is who we are, and this is what we do.</p>
<p>Stargazer is committed to sustainability, community, and product.</p>
<p> <strong>Commitment to sustainability</strong>:  To the extent that it’s possible, we will use power from renewable resources and include energy-saving technologies in our engineering. Water that’s used for heating and cooling will be recirculated and reused, instead of being allowed to go down the drain. Waste products from the brewing process will be returned to the environment through composting or used as livestock feed rather than going to a landfill. Our bottles will be washed and reused, and paper and cardboard products will be recycled. All of this is good for us and good for the environment.</p>
<p> <strong>Commitment to community</strong>: Our intent is to provide permanent jobs to local people, at good wages and with attractive benefits. Our hiring will be without regard to race, gender, and orientation. We will create a workplace that’s friendly and enjoyable, and treat our people like they’re <em>our </em>people: our friends and family. Beyond our company, we will work to integrate with the community at large through providing student internships and supporting local pro-social causes. In short, we want this company to be as good a citizen as we are ourselves.</p>
<p> Oh, and about our beer…</p>
<p> <strong>Commitment to product</strong>: We will use locally-grown ingredients to make distinctive beers that reflect the unique character of their place of origin. Winemakers call this <em>terroir</em>; we want to bring that sensibility to bear upon our brewing. Further, we are interested in making and promoting less-common beer styles that don’t get much attention from large industrial breweries, thereby making enjoyment of beer a richer and more varied experience. We recognize that brewing is a real craft, and that great beer is <em>made</em>, not simply manufactured.</p>
<p> Make an investment in Stargazer Brewing and help us protect the environment and share great beer with the world!</p>

<h2><strong>My Story</strong></h2>

<p>Hello, I’m Tiffany Krumins inventor of the AVA the Elephant medicine dispenser and I'm an entrepreneur who is passionate about helping children. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>As I worked with children with special needs and volunteered at my local children's hospital, I watched children refuse to take the medicine their illness dictated and I was inspired to design and patent a one-of-a-kind talking medicine dispenser, AVA the Elephant!  AVA takes the fear and anxiety out of medicine time! (<a href=""http://www.avatheelephant.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.AVAtheElephant.com</a>)  </p>

<p>I got my lucky break on ABCs Shark Tank when Barbara Corcoran invested $50,000 in AVA – taking my idea from prototype to consumer product!</p>
<p>Shortly after the show I was diagnosed with cancer and my desire to help sick children only grew, I knew so well the pain they faced.  </p>
<p>For the launch of my second product I wanted to take a different approach.  Read this article to learn why I decided on Indiegogo and crowd funding:</p>

I am thrilled to offer parents &amp; caregivers a non-invasive, kid friendly way to read a child's temperature!</p>
<p>I made sure the stickers were Latex-FREE, hypoallergenic, and could be easily placed on the child's forehead. I kept the design simple and fun, and made sure the child's temperature was easy to read. </p>

Ava, you take the anxiety out of medicine time..which makes the whole family happy! THANK YOU for making Braison’s world a happier place!” 
 
""My 20 month old daughter would absolutely NOT take her medicine for her Croup. She thrashed and cvried and spit it back on us, until we used Ava on her! My husband had to apologize for his eye-rolling when he saw the unbelievably dramatic difference in her behavior. She actually nodded and opened her mouth when Ava counted and said ""Open Wide""! Ava makes a HUGE difference in getting her to comply. I will give this as a gift to anyone with little ones!!!""

<p>Crowd-funding will allow us to get the GO Box ball rolling by expanding this concept into a major American city. After that, the program should expand synergistically: As more vendors and members sign up, more income will be generated, more inventory will get purchased, and expansion at new locations will take place. Our biggest challenge is the ambitious goal of rolling this program out at multiple Bay Area cities. If the campaign does not reach its goal, the funds will be used to implement the program in a smaller geographic area as we continue to seek additional funding. <i>But the first step is to get the genie out of the ""GO Box""!</i></p>
<h4><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px; background-color: initial;"">Here are the key elements needed to get the project off the ground:</b></h4>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px; background-color: initial;""></b></p>
<p><b>Inventory ($5,000):</b> We will need $5,000 to purchase an inventory of 1,000 containers. This will be enough to begin implementing the program in the downtown core and conduct pilots in select cities and corporate locations around the San Francisco Bay Area.</p>
<p><b>Drop Boxes ($1,000):</b> These attractive, custom made drop-off boxes are made from sustainably harvested wood. The price also includes a liner made from non-porous durable nylon.</p>
<p><b>Operations ($5,000)</b>: At its core, GO Box will need to be an efficient pick up and delivery service. To make that happen in a cost-effective way, we're partnering with restaurants and soup kitchens with commercial dishwashing facilities to wash the containers. But we still need to hire staff and deal with logistics. We'll also be purchasing a fleet of bikes and and bike trailers for efficient and zero emission transporting of the containers. </p>
<p><b>Outreach for Membership and Partnerships ($2,000):</b> For the program to succeed and expand, we will need to recruit more users and reach out to municipalities and companies for partnership and support. This will take time and expenses but these relationships and stream of income is the backbone of the business, so it's an important one!</p>
<p><b>Technology ($2,000): </b>We can run the program using tokens, but wouldn't it be better if we had Android and iOs smartphone apps and SmartCard technology for optimum check-out and return of the containers? <b><i>Continuous improvement on user experience is critical to our success!</i></b></p>

<p style=""display: inline !important;""><b>When I was 9 years old my family moved from an suburban American town to a village in the island of Crete, Greece. I returned back to the U.S when I was 16 to finish high school and attend college. Spending my formative years in a small village gave me insight into ways other people see the world and live their lives. Most importantly, I was able to see (and be drawn to) the beautiful diversity our planet in terms of people and the environment. I'm passionate about work that makes a difference in the world and I take pride in seeing my projects reach their full potential. I don't like wasting opportunities or resources as I know how valuable they are. </b></p>

<p>Since graduating college and subsequently getting my green MBA from the Presidio School of Management, I've worked on bringing once marginal environmental concepts into the mainstream. As an Americorps volunteer, I worked on urban gardening and greening and created a food business using products grown by youth in urban gardens. As the Associate Director for an environmental non-profit in the energy sector, I created and managed a program in peak power management (Demand-Response), a marketplace now worth over 1.3 billion dollars. With GO Box, I look forward to continue playing a role in ushering in new products and services that improve our world.</p>
<p>Waste reduction is synergistic with the energy conservation work I've been doing with small businesses and  property management firms. The people I speak with to implement energy saving initiatives are the same people I will need to talk to about implementing this waste reduction initiative. These companies along with the their sustainability-minded workers will be our customers. </p>
<p><b><i>So far, everyone I have spoken to wholeheartedly embraces the idea AND can't wait to get started!!</i></b></p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px; background-color: initial;"">Frequently Asked Questions: </b></p>
<p><b><i>Are the containers clean and safe? </i></b>The cleaning and sanitizing standards used are the same as those required of restaurants. GO Box containers are cleaned using commercial dishwashing equipment in a health department certified facility. After washing, the containers are also inspected by GO Box staff.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b><i>Can I bring my own clean container to the restaurant and ask them to serve my food in it?</i></b> FDA rules prohibit restaurants from serving food in a container brought in to the establishment by a customer (beverage containers, like coffee mugs, are exempt from this rule). GO Box has solved this problem by delivering professionally-sanitized containers directly to the vendors. You are allowed, however, to take leftovers from your plate and put them in a container you brought in. </p>
<p><b><i>Where will I be able to pick up food in a GO Box container once I sign up for the program? </i></b>You will be able to take food to-go in any GO Box participating restaurant. Our goal is to get as many restaurants on board as possible, as soon as possible.</p>
<p><b><i>What if people don’t return their GOBox containers?</i></b> Only GO Box members (either by having a token or the GoBox app showing current membership) will be allowed to take food in the reusable container. Membership will be verified by participating vendors. Upon return of your container at the drop site you will receive a token or scan your card allowing continued use of the system. Depending on technology capability, we may hold a deposit allowing you to continue using GO Box while having others unreturned.  The deposit will incentivize people to bring their containers back!</p>
<p><b><i>Won’t the collection bins get smelly and attract pests?</i></b> The GO Box program in Portland has drop boxes in locations ranging from office lobbies to gyms and this have <b>never</b> been an issue in two years of operation. The sturdy and secure collection box along with the washable non-porous liner makes this not a problem.  The liner is changed at every pick up several times a week.</p>
<p><b><i>What about recyclable, compostable, or biodegradable containers? Aren’t those enough? </i></b>Good question. Every time a reusable takeout container is used, that’s one less single-use container manufactured for just one meal. Each of those disposables needs to be manufactured, shipped a long way, and cared for at its end-of-life, leading to significant environmental impacts. Secondly, given today’s infrastructure and consumer behavior, most disposable containers still end up in the landfill, regardless of whether or not they could be recycled or composted. And finally, reusable takeout containers enable more economic activity to happen locally. We pay people to collect, clean, and redistribute the containers locally rather than paying manufacturers and distributors to make and ship containers a long distance.</p>
<p><b><i>Do containers get stained or fall apart if they’re used too many times?</i></b> The containers have been tested in hundreds of places by thousands of customers and typically last for more than 400 uses and they don’t stain. Additionally they get inspected before going our and problem ones get removed from circulation.</p>
<p><b><i>Can I put GO Box containers in my own dishwasher or microwave?</i></b> Yes, they are microwave and dishwasher safe.</p>
<p><b>How clean does the GO Box container need to be before I put it in the drop box? Do I need to wash it?</b><br/>You do not need to wash or rinse the container before returning it to the drop box, <b>but please make sure it’s as free of food and liquid as possible.</b> If you have the ability to easily give it a quick rinse, that’s great, but not necessary.</p>
<p><b>Do you have any handouts I can email to coworkers and friends or print out for my office?</b><br/>Yes we do! Please contact us. We also offer:<br/>Green Box Lunch Presentations– Invite GO Box out for a free presentation!<br/>Corporate Program – Get a Drop Box for your office!<br/></p>
<p><b>Can I buy more than one subscription?</b><br/>If you want to have a couple or several containers in circulation, no problem. You can buy as many subscriptions as you like. GO Box subscriptions also make great gifts!</p>
<p><b>What if I lose my container or my token?</b><br/>Please email us at info@goboxsfbay.com if you lost your container or token.</p>

GO Box is the first reusable take-out container system available to the public that makes it easier to avoid the single-use disposables we encounter on a daily basis.
 

As a GO Box member, you can ask for a GO Box at your favorite participating vendors all over San Francisco and select Bay Area cities. 


With GO Box, your meal is served in a BPA-free, durable, and reusable container that is dishwasher and microwave safe and will be recycled at the end of its life. Now, you can eat your lunch and love the planet too!
 The containers can be returned at convenient drop-off locations and washed at commercial dishwashing facilities. A sparkling clean container will be waiting for you to use again the next time you visit your favorite restaurant!We are partnering with local restaurants like the five-star Luce Restaurant to wash GO Boxes and with soup kitchens like St. Anthony's to wash the containers after-hours when their dishwashing equipment sits idle. By optimizing the use of their commercial dishwashers, we are creating new job opportunities and a new green service for our cities!


 
Why is GO Box Important?The GO Box service aims to reduce waste at the source, which is the best and most sustainable solution to our trash problem. Reusing saves energy, prevents pollution, fights climate change and takes pressure off our already overflowing landfills. We need to chip away at throw-away culture and usher in the new paradigm of reuse. Single-use disposable products are a relatively recent phenomenon. In the mid-50s the plastic and chemical industries sold the American public on the convenience of the “throwaway” lifestyle.  Now, throw-away packaging from every industrial nation litters beaches and oceans world-wide, piles up in landfills and contributes vast amounts of methane to the atmosphere. To learn more, please visit http://www.cleanwateraction.org/ca/rethinkdisposable Furthermore, trash reduction is the law as cities are under pressure to reach their trash reduction mandates.  The plastic bag ban is one example, and we've been receiving steady inquiries from Bay Area cities to bring Go Box to them. This innovative program will PREVENT thousands of single-use food containers from ending up in the trash and help change the landscape of lunchtime waste generation at:

food vendors
favorite eating spots
the office
the landfill
in our streets and waterways

And you can have a ground-level role in making it happen!Your backing of this project will be a vote of support. It will send a message that people like the idea of product reuse and stewardship. And thanks to crowd-funding platforms such as Indiegogo, people now have the power to vote with their dollars to help create bottom-up green initiatives instead of waiting passively for government to do so. Together, let's take a leadership role to create green jobs and needed new green services that didn't exist before! Success here means expansion to other cities and a vote for Reuse!
What We Need:

Crowd-funding will allow us to get the GO Box ball rolling by expanding this concept into a major American city. After that, the program should expand synergistically: As more vendors and members sign up, more income will be generated, more inventory will get purchased, and expansion at new locations will take place. Our biggest challenge is the ambitious goal of rolling this program out at multiple Bay Area cities. If the campaign does not reach its goal, the funds will be used to implement the program in a smaller geographic area as we continue to seek additional funding. But the first step is to get the genie out of the ""GO Box""!
Here are the key elements needed to get the project off the ground:

Inventory ($5,000): We will need $5,000 to purchase an inventory of 1,000 containers. This will be enough to begin implementing the program in the downtown core and conduct pilots in select cities and corporate locations around the San Francisco Bay Area.
Drop Boxes ($1,000): These attractive, custom made drop-off boxes are made from sustainably harvested wood. The price also includes a liner made from non-porous durable nylon.
Operations ($5,000): At its core, GO Box will need to be an efficient pick up and delivery service. To make that happen in a cost-effective way, we're partnering with restaurants and soup kitchens with commercial dishwashing facilities to wash the containers. But we still need to hire staff and deal with logistics. We'll also be purchasing a fleet of bikes and and bike trailers for efficient and zero emission transporting of the containers. 
Outreach for Membership and Partnerships ($2,000): For the program to succeed and expand, we will need to recruit more users and reach out to municipalities and companies for partnership and support. This will take time and expenses but these relationships and stream of income is the backbone of the business, so it's an important one!
Technology ($2,000): We can run the program using tokens, but wouldn't it be better if we had Android and iOs smartphone apps and SmartCard technology for optimum check-out and return of the containers? Continuous improvement on user experience is critical to our success!

Meet the Founder of GO Box SF, 
Paul Liotsakis:



When I was 9 years old my family moved from an suburban American town to a village in the island of Crete, Greece. I returned back to the U.S when I was 16 to finish high school and attend college. Spending my formative years in a small village gave me insight into ways other people see the world and live their lives. Most importantly, I was able to see (and be drawn to) the beautiful diversity our planet in terms of people and the environment. I'm passionate about work that makes a difference in the world and I take pride in seeing my projects reach their full potential. I don't like wasting opportunities or resources as I know how valuable they are. 



Since graduating college and subsequently getting my green MBA from the Presidio School of Management, I've worked on bringing once marginal environmental concepts into the mainstream. As an Americorps volunteer, I worked on urban gardening and greening and created a food business using products grown by youth in urban gardens. As the Associate Director for an environmental non-profit in the energy sector, I created and managed a program in peak power management (Demand-Response), a marketplace now worth over 1.3 billion dollars. With GO Box, I look forward to continue playing a role in ushering in new products and services that improve our world.
Waste reduction is synergistic with the energy conservation work I've been doing with small businesses and  property management firms. The people I speak with to implement energy saving initiatives are the same people I will need to talk to about implementing this waste reduction initiative. These companies along with the their sustainability-minded workers will be our customers. 
So far, everyone I have spoken to wholeheartedly embraces the idea AND can't wait to get started!!
Frequently Asked Questions: 
Are the containers clean and safe? The cleaning and sanitizing standards used are the same as those required of restaurants. GO Box containers are cleaned using commercial dishwashing equipment in a health department certified facility. After washing, the containers are also inspected by GO Box staff.

Can I bring my own clean container to the restaurant and ask them to serve my food in it? FDA rules prohibit restaurants from serving food in a container brought in to the establishment by a customer (beverage containers, like coffee mugs, are exempt from this rule). GO Box has solved this problem by delivering professionally-sanitized containers directly to the vendors. You are allowed, however, to take leftovers from your plate and put them in a container you brought in. 
Where will I be able to pick up food in a GO Box container once I sign up for the program? You will be able to take food to-go in any GO Box participating restaurant. Our goal is to get as many restaurants on board as possible, as soon as possible.
What if people don’t return their GOBox containers? Only GO Box members (either by having a token or the GoBox app showing current membership) will be allowed to take food in the reusable container. Membership will be verified by participating vendors. Upon return of your container at the drop site you will receive a token or scan your card allowing continued use of the system. Depending on technology capability, we may hold a deposit allowing you to continue using GO Box while having others unreturned.  The deposit will incentivize people to bring their containers back!
Won’t the collection bins get smelly and attract pests? The GO Box program in Portland has drop boxes in locations ranging from office lobbies to gyms and this have never been an issue in two years of operation. The sturdy and secure collection box along with the washable non-porous liner makes this not a problem.  The liner is changed at every pick up several times a week.
What about recyclable, compostable, or biodegradable containers? Aren’t those enough? Good question. Every time a reusable takeout container is used, that’s one less single-use container manufactured for just one meal. Each of those disposables needs to be manufactured, shipped a long way, and cared for at its end-of-life, leading to significant environmental impacts. Secondly, given today’s infrastructure and consumer behavior, most disposable containers still end up in the landfill, regardless of whether or not they could be recycled or composted. And finally, reusable takeout containers enable more economic activity to happen locally. We pay people to collect, clean, and redistribute the containers locally rather than paying manufacturers and distributors to make and ship containers a long distance.
Do containers get stained or fall apart if they’re used too many times? The containers have been tested in hundreds of places by thousands of customers and typically last for more than 400 uses and they don’t stain. Additionally they get inspected before going our and problem ones get removed from circulation.
Can I put GO Box containers in my own dishwasher or microwave? Yes, they are microwave and dishwasher safe.
How clean does the GO Box container need to be before I put it in the drop box? Do I need to wash it?You do not need to wash or rinse the container before returning it to the drop box, but please make sure it’s as free of food and liquid as possible. If you have the ability to easily give it a quick rinse, that’s great, but not necessary.
Do you have any handouts I can email to coworkers and friends or print out for my office?Yes we do! Please contact us. We also offer:Green Box Lunch Presentations– Invite GO Box out for a free presentation!Corporate Program – Get a Drop Box for your office!
Can I buy more than one subscription?If you want to have a couple or several containers in circulation, no problem. You can buy as many subscriptions as you like. GO Box subscriptions also make great gifts!
What if I lose my container or my token?Please email us at info@goboxsfbay.com if you lost your container or token.

</p><p></p><p>Fall 2011: Stepping
straight up the 45-degree slope, I follow the tracks just made by a mob of 5 or
so elk. Fresh snow makes tracking easy.
I turn as the elk did and move slowly across the steep slope, being careful of my footing with each step. I shift my rifle to my right shoulder, the
downhill side, and reach out to steady myself with my left hand. I can touch
the ground without bending over.  My downhill foot slips and I
lunge for a tree to catch my fall, causing my rifle sling to slip off my
shoulder. I grab for the sling with my left hand, slip again and sit down
heavily, sliding down the hill several feet. The sling, hanging from
the crook of my arm, allows the rifle to sit nicely in the snow.<br/></p><p><b><i>Starting a long day</i></b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/523163/files/20140421131157-Nov2011ElkHuntHagerMtn.jpg?1398111117"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>Ten
minutes later I have cleared the snow from the barrel, wiped down the rifle,
and am moving again.</p>
<p>This was during my
first elk hunt in 2011. My bud Jim and I were in the Fremont Mountains of
Oregon hunting on the northern slopes of Hager Mountain. The thing about elk is
they really don’t like people, or roads, or trails, or terrain that is remotely
comfortable for a human to travel on. </p><p></p><p><i><b>Hager Mountain Summit</b></i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/515253/files/20140417112115-hager-mountain2.jpg?1397758875"" src="""" style=""line-height: 1.45em;""/></p><p>
</p><p>That
slip and fall is memorable not because it happened once, but rather because it
happened dozens of times. Along with the difficult terrain, I was being
sabotaged by my equipment choices, specifically my pack and rifle sling in
combination. The pack was uncomfortable and pulled me off balance even with the
modest 20 pounds of stuff I was carrying, and it was too wide to allow the
rifle to sling and stay on my shoulder. The width also made it catch and grab
at the manzanita, scrub pine and blow-down we were surrounded by. I fell,
dropped my rifle, and slipped and slid all day long. We saw and stalked that
small group of elk for about 10 hours but they gave us the slip crossing over
to the south side of the peak. By day’s end I was little more than an exhausted
pile of frustration.</p>
<p>There had to be a better way to
sling a pack and rifle  so you have good balance, both hands free, but
still have quick and quiet access to your rifle, That night Jim and I started to modify my pack and sling to make it better suited for the job. I made a
hacked up version that marginally improved the sling but most importantly it
started the wheels turning.</p>

She has trained to be a doula and is a single mother to an amazing two year old. They are really struggling right now. She has finally found a place and is no longer homeless. She has a job but it doesn't pay enough money for her to pay for child care. My friend's mother can watch her child for free but unfortunately she has no transportation most days to get her daughter to her mothers so she can go to work. She has been finding ways to make things work with friends helping out but these solutions aren't reliable. She recently started having to miss work due to lack of child care. She could very likely lose her job if this keeps happening and then we fear they will end up homeless again. She has the training to be a doula and make more money to support her family, but she can't keep her current job or be a doula without reliable transportation. Another friend of hers and I were trying to come up with a solution so she doesn't end up back in a scary situation where she has no job and her and her daughter have no housing. She is the most amazing mother and we want her to be able to focus on that rather worrying if they will have a place to live next month. We just want to see our friend and her amazing daughter have the stability and security they deserve. We are so saddened and tired of watching them struggle no matter how hard she tries. After talking with our friend we realized the only solution to empower her to be able to take care of her family long term is to help her acquire reliable transportation. She doesn't have family with money to provide this and has never owned a reliable car. She is always putting forth all she has to do the best she can for her daughter. I know if we can get her a car that she won't have to worry about losing her job, not having childcare or being homeless ever again. A car could give her the one break she needs...

In August, QCJ was incorporated as Jamaica's first and only lesbian and bisexual organisation. The mission of QCJ is to improve the quality of lives for lesbian, bisexual and women who have sex with other women (WSW) by creating a safe space in which they can share emotional, social and other issues they are facing without fear or judgement and equipping them with knowledge and understanding to navigate the Jamaican society.In this short period, we have positioned ourselves as an organisation that represents the lesbian and bisexual community - an under-served community, as well as a partner for the rights of women and girls; we are known locally and internationally and have been called on for insight and information.This campaign will allow QCJ to continue the important work started in 2013 for the under-served lesbian, bisexual and WSW community in Jamaica. This year we want to provide programs to educate and empower lesbian and bisexual women, in the form of workshops, talks, focus groups, etc around issues which the community identifies as important, continue with our visible
activism and engage in activities to help move the human rights of LGBT Jamaicans forward despite the challenges.Below are photographs taken from stands/protests in Kingston Jamaica either organised or supported by QCJ (for a total of 10 stands)QCJ in Action",10.0,1,"4 Campaigns

<h3>Our Mission</h3>
<p>Sustainable Wares provides a full range of mindfully curated earth-friendly gifts and necessities. We are here to promote companies and artists that create products in a socially and environmentally responsible manner. We want to change what you buy and be mindful of your purchases. We want to inspire you to take the steps you need to create a comfortable, enjoyable, happy, fun, beautiful, sustainable, earth-friendly life. Besides providing a sustainable shopping experience we want to provide information and community outreach on transitioning to a more sustainable, low waste lifestyle.</p>
<p>We have been dreaming of expanding our refill and zero-waste section and now is the time to make those dreams come true. With this campaign, Sustainable Wares will help you achieve your goals of a low-waste lifestyle. If we reuse and refill we can reduce our community's need to recycle or send waste to the already full landfill. Save the planet, save our community!</p>
<p>No contribution is too small, and no effort to reduce our waste is too small! Let's do it one bottle at a time!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Sustainable Wares needs help to create a new low-waste, refill section in our Homer, AK store. We want to be completely transparent about how the funds will be invested so here is the breakdown. Please keep in mind these are only estimates of what we need to get this refill dream made into reality.</p>
<ol>
<li>$500 Scales, we would like to have two high-quality scales. This will include the necessary permits and certifications.</li>
<li>$500 Small dishwasher and installation. Having a dishwasher will allow us to include a bottle exchange/donation program.</li>
<li>$1000 Advertising and promotions. The majority of this budget will go towards becoming an underwriter for KBBI again and sponsoring non-profits that work to promote sustainability in Homer and all of Alaska. A very small portion will be used for social media advertising.</li>
<li>$1000 Bulk bins and dispensers. These are surprisingly expensive! We will be using upcycled and used items as much as possible.</li>
<li>$1000 Construction. We will have a countertop and table made out of upcycled materials. This also includes other supplies (signage) and labor costs.</li>
<li>$4500 Inventory and freight. The big expense! This includes the initial low-waste, plastic-free, and bulk merchandise.</li>
<li>$500 Miscellaneous and unknowns. There are always unknown expenses!</li>
</ol>
<p>If we go beyond our funding goal Sustainable Wares will have the opportunity grow into a mightier and more impactful store for the Homer community. Let's go beyond this goal so we can go CRAZY AND GROW!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal we will still create a system to make your refill purchases easy and add more refillable options as our budget allows. We carefully choose your perks so that they will still be available no matter how close we get to our goal.</p>
<p>Get excited about the INVENTORY! What will be available in beginning?</p>
<ol>
<li>Alpenglow Skincare Products: We will add their very popular face cream to our selection. We will also be able to have a larger quantity of all their products. Having locally made reduces our carbon footprint and shipping costs!</li>
<li>Molly's Suds: One of Sustainable Wares' favorite laundry detergent already, they now have bulk options available. Molly's Suds has recently introduced a variety of other cleaning products like All-Purpose Cleaner and Dish Soap. This is what inspired us to make our refill dreams come true!</li>
<li>Dental Care: Toothpaste, Toothpowder, and tablets. All refillable or completely recyclable!</li>
<li>Natural fiber and wood brushes: Compostable, replaceable, biodegradable cleaning brushes.</li>
<li>More, more, and more so our community can have less waste!: More reusable bags and containers.</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What is Homer's waste impact? In FY 2019 Homer hauled out:</p>
<ol>
<li>8,264 tons of solid waste</li>
<li>342 tons of recyclables</li>
<li>649 tons of metals</li>
<li>9.39 tons of electronic recyclables</li>
</ol>
<p>FY 2019 Homer landfill data from <a href=""https://www.kpb.us/swd-waste/about-solidwaste"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.kpb.us/swd-waste/about-solidwaste</a></p>
<p>What is Sustainable Wares' small and mighty (and growing!) impact?</p>
<ol>
<li> In 2019, we added to our selection of Alpenglow Skincare Products and sold 631 floz., which is equivalent to 78.88 8 floz bottles not going to our landfill or recycling system. This is currently the only refillable option in the store. We have a very small but dedicated group taking advantage of this option. Just imagine if we were able to let all of Homer know they can get their favorite skincare product and not add to the tons of waste we have to ship out! <i>Side note: Homer has to ship all waste and recycling out because our landfill is FULL! </i>
</li>
<li>Once we are able to add more refillable options to the store the impact will be felt throughout Homer and all of our households! Let's break it down and look at laundry detergent because that will be the first addition to our expanded refill section. Let's say a household buys 5 (<i>I made this amount up!</i>) bottles of detergent in a year, and 2,000 (<i>I made this amount up also, but you get the point!</i>) households switch to our refillable options, we will save 10,000 bottles from hitting the waste/recycling stream every year! That is a  mighty impact for Homer and Sustainable Wares!</li>
<li>Let's talk about packaging! Nope, that is too big of a topic to get into here! Just know we will use these funds to reduce the packaging that comes into Homer and in turn be shipped out (remember, our landfill is FULL!). We will also be increasing our inventory of reusable, package-free, and plastic-free items. That way, you will be able to reduce your impact on the waste/recycling stream in Homer.</li>
</ol>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Because we have some awesome friends and supporters, we have full confidence that we will reach our funding goal to expand the refill, reusable, and plastic-free section of Sustainable Wares. If that does not happen, the money that is raised will still go towards the growth of Sustainable Wares and this refill dream but at a smaller and slower scale.</p>
<p>The perks we choose to show our appreciation are not dependent on the money raised as they are already a part of our inventory. Everyone will still receive the perks they requested. Sometimes things are completely out of our control. If problems do arise there might be a delay in delivery of your requested perk or we might need to change your perk to something equivalent.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Believe me, I know that even donating $5 to a cause that is important to you and your community is sometimes impossible. Luckily there are so many other ways to contribute to our campaign.</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the word out about our campaign to bring refillable and zero-waste to Sustainable Wares. Tell your friends, family, co-workers, share everybody! Shout it to the world!</li>
<li>Share, share, and share on social media! You have 30 days of sharing! And ask your friends, family, co-workers, and everybody to share! Use the Indiegogo share tools.</li>

I'll have the oportunity to meet many professional riders and make my country be one step closer for having the same level of other countries who are known for having the best riders.What I Need & What You GetSince it is very expensive to take my own horses all the way to Florida, I will be renting one for a week, which will help me compete in different categories, going from jumping 1.20m until 1.30m (3' 11.2"" - 4' 3.2""). Im asking for $2,500 wich will help me pay the horse rent as well as the registration fees for competing. If I don't reach my entire goal at least I believe I will be able to pay some of the expenses.What I am offering you in exchange for helping me is:
My experience, contacts, videos and pictures of the event and my competitions. 

If you have a business and you help with my funding, I will use your logo on my show jumping jacket, or in the horses saddle pad. I will promote your business by telling everyone how you helped me funding my cause.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

We decided to go visit family because chances of finding a new job around the holidays are slim (hasn't stopped him from trying of course, but the CO Workforce page has had 1 job for him all month, good thing he isn't relying on them!). Today we got notice that the unemployment we were counting on to make bills won't be coming through. Since Wolf left the job before this last one voluntarily (he hurt his back and his supervisor was a jerk), he doesn't qualify for more than 2 weeks of unemployment! You can do the math, he's already been off work for a month!</p><p>The really bad news came on New Year's Day. We got a call from our house sitter. One of our water pipes burst and flooded our basement. At first I'm thinking it's bad, but then we Skype and it's not just bad, it's disastrous. There's a couple inches of water throughout the basement kitchen, family room, dining room, and bathroom, plus the main level bathroom, and water pouring out of what's left of the ceiling. The ceiling had fallen in multiple areas, the carpet was a lake, and the patio outside was an ice rink from the water pouring out of the house! The mitigation crew gets started almost immediately and by the time we come home a few days later we have nothing left of the basement but studs and a bath tub. Oh, and 15-20 really loud fans and dehumidifiers, and a lovely curtain wall keeping us from our bedroom. Our original campaign was to purchase some appliances for that kitchen and open it as a commercial kitchen for use for local foodies. The floors in both bathrooms were also on our ""one day"" list to update. Unfortunately that ""one day"" wasn't in the plans any time soon! Yes, we are lucky enough to have insurance, and yes, they are covering the damage. Unfortunately we have the typical large deductible and while they cover the damage, they do not cover the plumbing work to fix the problem. Which isn't just a simple patch job. We need to move multiple pipes out of the exterior walls, and into an interior spaces, so we don't have this problem every time it drops below -10 or so. It doesn't seem right to me that they won't cover that part, but that's what they say. A contractor was just here to give an estimate and said not to be surprised by the large difference in what the insurance will give us and what it's actually going to cost. He said there is a lot of work that needs to be done to bring things up to code. He also mentioned the insurance will give us values that are depreciated not actual replacement value. He said we aren't going to like the quote. </p><p>Now if that isn't enough for you. As we are poking around looking at this plumbing problem we find not one but 3 more leaks! Since these leaks are small ones that haven't caused disasters, insurance will not be covering those. The leaks are in the walls so they weren't visible until the dry wall was removed. They are serious enough to cause mold though. </p><p>Now not only are we faced with a deductible and large plumbing bill, we are faced with the decision to figure out a way to pay for the upgrades to the planned areas out of pocket right now or have them replaced with similar stuff that was there before and tear it all up later to upgrade. Of course the latter just seems silly so we are trying to find the money to make the upgrades now. This will allow us to put in the stuff we want to make that area a workable space. We aren't talking granite counter tops here, just changing wood floors and carpet to all tile in the kitchen/dining area, and adding one cabinet to make the island a better use of space. Our goal is to hold community homesteading classes (beekeeping, cheese making, incubating, chicken raising, knitting, canning, etc) in there as well as provide a store area for local homesteaders to showcase their stuff and have a central location for buyers to purchase from multiple vendors without having to wait for farmer's markets, and without charging the vendors an arm and a leg. </p><p>So, now your money will be helping us rebuild into an even brighter future of helping our local homestead community and beyond. </p><p><br/></p><p>Background on us....</p><p>We've always known locally produced items are good in multiple ways including environmentally, sustainability, and economically. Unfortunately we can't always pay the large prices that usually come attached to local products or find sources for homemade products outside of a farmers market. We buy a lot from farmer's markets but have recently found that the choices of actual local grown produce is getting harder and harder to find there. I can guess one reason for this is the high prices the market's charge vendors. It just doesn't make sense as an individual to sell there. </p><p>7 months ago we were lucky enough to find some land and be able to start a hobby farm where we can provide some of these items for ourselves. We know we are not alone in our desire to support local artisans/farmers and not being able to. We realized we'll be able to produce a lot more than we need for our small family and want to share it, but after looking into local markets, it doesn't make financial sense to go that route. We have decided it is a great opportunity for us to allow others access to local foods and products without that overhead. This is not intended to be a commercial operation or to make a profit. We don't expect to be able to quit our day jobs or have no expenses. But if we can offset our expenses a little and help others have access to products and customers we are happy. For instance we sell our extra non-gmo, free range eggs for $3/dz, the same price you can buy non organic, ""cage-free"" at our local grocery store. This comes nowhere near covering the cost of the chicken feed, but our options are to feed the extra eggs to the animals or provide others an opportunity to experience home grown food at a price they can afford while lowering our feed costs a bit. We would much rather do the latter. </p><p>Talking with friends and neighbors we realized others are also making and growing items that they would like to offer others but don't have a place or time to make it a reality. We would like to bring other artisans/homesteaders/gardeners a place to come together and provide a community setting to buy/sell/exchange items. This would provide a place to get honey from one person, eggs from another, and vegetables from a third all in one trip for example. Or have some extra eggs but your tomato plants didn't do well? Work out a trade with someone. Nowhere else will you find that flexibility. We will allow buyers access to products without having to wait for a certain day or season, and vendor's wont have to spend every saturday sitting at a farmers' market and paying to be there. </p><p>We were originally trying to raise money to expand our operation with the following projects.

<li>This amount will cover 12 months of focused professional instruction. </li> <li>The full year of instruction will allow me to dedicate at least 30 hours a week to training &amp; practicing with world class instructors at world class facilities.</li>
<li>Any additional money raised will be used to provide me the opportunity to travel and enter competitions worldwide!</li>

have learned about the 10,000 hour rule, which basically says that if you put
in the time and effort to perfect your skill set, you will become a professional. I love to skate and compete more than anything in the world and I'm looking for the opportunity to do it as much as I can and at the most competitive level. This is my dream!  And I know that with your help; in addition to hard work and dedication, my dreams will come true! </div>
<div>Thank You and God Bless!</div>
</div></div>","Short Summary Hi! My name is Lazer and I'm 9 years old. I’ve
been skateboarding since I was 5 years old and I’ve
always wanted to be a professional skateboarder. It's my dream to become a professional skateboarder and I know I'm right on track! With the right support, commitment and hard work I know I can do whatever I put my mind to. I feel blessed to have found something I love and am passionate about at such a young age. See the gallery for photos and videos of me skateboarding (link Below)https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/help-child-skate-prodigy-lazer-crawford-turn-pro/x/8722739#gallery 
   What I Need & What You Get I've been able to achieve great success at a young age with the support of my family and friends, but in order to progress to the next level and skate as a professional, I need more hours of professional instruction and exposure to competitions worldwide.
The money we raise will all be going towards professional instructors and more excitingly, the opportunity to travel and enter competitions worldwide.

  The Impact The campaign goal of $24,000 was set with one single focus: Opportunity. 
This amount will cover 12 months of focused professional instruction.  The full year of instruction will allow me to dedicate at least 30 hours a week to training & practicing with world class instructors at world class facilities.
Any additional money raised will be used to provide me the opportunity to travel and enter competitions worldwide!

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Women in the village have also adopted the modern way of hand-weaving. The women pull spools of thread from nail to nail to create a set of thread of more than 40 metres. The thread is then boiled in dye then stringed to create a tie dyed-like effect. Though the process is long and tedious, these women stay true to the whole practice. The coloured thread is intricately arranged to create the unique Karen style fabric woven today.

<p><b>About</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This campaign is a part of a social participatory project kickstarted by a team of three students from Singapore and Myanmar.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Driven by the idea to empower ethnic minorities in the hills of Northern Thailand, we wanted to provide means in which the villagers, themselves, can innovate and participate in improving their lives. After living in Mae Sa for a month, we learnt that they aspire to weave more and explore the possibility of earning small amounts from this skill. Thus, we brought together the women of the village to form a weaver’s committee for e-commerce. While we trained the committee on the basics of managing an online business, the committee took charge of conducting fair trade and practiced equitable opportunities for all members. Our hope for this project is to inspire these women to sustain their own economy independently. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Your pledge will go a long way in empowering the village women and supporting the development of their families.</p>

Sadly, lesser and lesser number of women in the village continue this form of weaving. With a bigger weaving stand, the modern method enables women to produce in larger amount but quality is not skimmed upon as everything is still handmade.Saro and Phrai Pon hand-weave the Karen Headscarf worn by females of all ages using the traditional method. They are two of the three weavers left in the village who still practice the traditional way of weaving these headscarves thread by thread. Paying attention to every detail and pattern, each of them make up to 2 headscarves a week. While Karen women don the headscarf to complete their ethnic wear, the embroidered fabric can be used for other decorative purposes as well! Use the fabric to make your very own ethnic pouch too! Comes in three colours: Red, Maroon and Salmon.



 

Women in the village have also adopted the modern way of hand-weaving. The women pull spools of thread from nail to nail to create a set of thread of more than 40 metres. The thread is then boiled in dye then stringed to create a tie dyed-like effect. Though the process is long and tedious, these women stay true to the whole practice. The coloured thread is intricately arranged to create the unique Karen style fabric woven today. Products available are the Karen Bag,  Karen Cloth/Sarong and Karen Shirts.






 






 
 



Apart from the simple collection, we also have a wide array of beaded shirts! Each a reflection of the weaver's individuality and skill in sewing detailed patterns, the following shirts are available on demand. Email us at hellomaesa@gmail.com and we'll gladly share with you in detail the patterns available as well as the price range.




 
Campaign Timeline

We strive to ship the products as soon as they are made and collated. We envision all items to be shipped out by September.
About
This campaign is a part of a social participatory project kickstarted by a team of three students from Singapore and Myanmar.
Driven by the idea to empower ethnic minorities in the hills of Northern Thailand, we wanted to provide means in which the villagers, themselves, can innovate and participate in improving their lives. After living in Mae Sa for a month, we learnt that they aspire to weave more and explore the possibility of earning small amounts from this skill. Thus, we brought together the women of the village to form a weaver’s committee for e-commerce. While we trained the committee on the basics of managing an online business, the committee took charge of conducting fair trade and practiced equitable opportunities for all members. Our hope for this project is to inspire these women to sustain their own economy independently. 
Your pledge will go a long way in empowering the village women and supporting the development of their families.

<p>Do you ever think about how much a period costs? Women living in poverty have to think about it, and sometimes have to choose between pads or tampons and food or electricity. Not only do manufacturers make around 60% even before the retailers add their profit margin, but the UK government adds VAT to this insult to women, judging their monthly needs to be ‘non-essential’ in VAT law.</p>
<p>Edinburgh Women for Independence and our sister organisations in East Lothian and Midlothian think this situation is bad enough for those who can afford period products but completely shameful for poor women and girls.  We want to raise £1000 to put pads and tampons in every food bank in Edinburgh.</p>
<p>The government should stop adding VAT to sanitary items and recognise them as ‘essential items’ in the same way as food. That would save most women around £1 per period – you might not think that is a lot, but if so, it’s because you aren’t in these women’s shoes. VAT is added to luxury items, but sanitary products are a necessity! Why are women and girls being taxed unfairly? We don't pay VAT on going to the bingo, on crocodile &amp; ostrich meat, on a wee Tunnock's teacake, on a box of herbal teabags, or on edible cake decorations! Which do you think is more essential than sanitary products?</p>
<p><strong>It's a global issue</strong></p>
<p>Periods and poverty are keeping women and girls away from education and economic independence around the world. Many girls are missing from school during their periods because their family cannot afford sanitary towels. </p>
<p>There will be girls in Scotland not attending school because their parents haven't been able to afford sanitary towels for them. This will be kept a secret and won't be showing up on any statistical explanations for school absences. Pads and tampons  are not provided in girls’ toilets at school alongside free soap, paper, towels and toilet paper, instead girls face the humiliating task of asking at the school office for help.</p>
<p><strong>It's an equality issue</strong></p>
<p>Women are bearing 85% of the financial burden of austerity policies in this country, and women are going to food banks every day to feed themselves and their families.  The least we can do is make sure that they can get supplies for their periods as well as food.  Periods are a natural part of girls and women's lives, and should never be seen as a source of embarrassment. It certainly should not isolate, oppress or shame girls and women. </p>

</p><h1>What Are Hookah Gems™? </h1><p>Absolute Fusion Hookah Gems™ 
are a revolutionary tobacco-free shisha alternative making Hookah safer,
 and more enjoyable than ever before. Featuring unique flavors from 
around the world and exotic combinations, we are confident that you will
 find a flavor to suit your tastes. Hookah Gems™ work just like any 
other shisha, simply load your funnel bowl with Hookah Gems™, apply 
coals and enjoy. Because our product uses pure glass, natural 
ingredients and heat to release steam you can trust Hookah Gems™ to 
always produce the coolest, cleanest, most flavorful clouds of hookah 
“smoke” that you will ever experience. Gone are the days of smoking 
harsh, bland and burnt tobacco shisha, so forget smoking and start 
steaming today with Absolute Fusion Hookah Gems™! </p>
<p><b>TOBACCO AND NICOTINE FREE: 
</b></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Hookah Gems™ are 100% tobacco and nicotine free. We have
	eliminated the need for tobacco filler in shisha by replacing it
	with premium glass Gems. Our proprietary Steam Solution™ mixed
	with our Gems is made with natural food grade ingredients. This
	allows us to omit the nicotine and tobacco -- eliminating most health risks that come with smoking traditional shisha. When you
	steam our product, you can be confident that you are getting the
	healthiest puffs possible.</p>
</li></ul><p><b>EXTENDED SMOKE TIMES: 
</b></p>
<ul><li>
<p>We are proud to say that with Hookah Gems™ you can more
	than double the length of your hookah session. While tobacco shisha
	may smoke up to 30-45 minutes, switching to Hookah Gems™ allows
	you to steam over 2x longer on the same bowl. No more changing
	multiple messy bowls during the middle of a party or hookah session;
	relax knowing that our Hookah Gems™ will provide you with thick
	clouds until you and your friends are finished steaming.</p>
</li></ul><p><b>NEVER HARSH: 
</b></p>
<ul><li>
<p>Hookah Gems™ are manufactured from premium glass and can
	never burn. These glass Gems are then mixed with our Steam Solution™
	which is made with only the purest and highest quality flavorings
	available. There are absolutely no sugars, dyes, or perfumes added
	in our flavoring process. This makes the steam smooth and extremely
	flavorful. Do not worry about waking up tomorrow morning with a sore
	throat from harsh shisha; our steam is cool and refreshing. Add as
	many coals as you see fit and you will not receive any throat bite.</p>
</li></ul><p><b>STEAMS COOLER, CLEANER, AND THICKER THAN TOBACCO SHISHA</b>
</p>
<ul><li>
<p>Unlike traditional tobacco shisha, which smokes good for half
	hour then loses flavor and thickness, Hookah Gems™ will smoke
	cool, clean, and thick for hours longer. The steam solution and our
	revolutionary Gem shape make this possible. Heat retention and
	increased airflow allow our steam to be like nothing you’ve
	experienced before. When it comes to flavor, thickness, and
	cleanliness, Absolute Fusion Hookah Gems™ exceed all others. 
	</p>
</li></ul><p><b>100% REUSABLE: 
</b></p>
<ul><li><p>Hookah Gems™, unlike any other hookah product on the
	market, have the ability to be reused. The premium glass
	construction allows you to wash them off after a session and use our
	refill kits* to revive the Gems for more steaming.

<p><b>CUSTOMIZABLE FLAVORING:

	the next.</p>

Il peut se décliner en trois points essentiels: </p>
<p>1. <b>Soutenir la viabilisation d'une structure d’accueil autogérée</b>, dans un lieu
protégé, destinée à la mise en œuvre et à la diffusion de programmes de
sensibilisation et de formation spécifiques (Education à l’environnement, Agro
écologie, Ecotourisme)</p>
<p>SUSTENTARTE,
ONG spécialiste en Eco construction et éducation environnementale et l'ICADC impliqué
depuis 1989 dans la promotion des jeunes et les échanges interculturels seront
les garants de ce programme.  </p>
<p>2. Promouvoir un <b>chantier international</b>, ouvrant à une <b>formation aux techniques
bio constructives</b>, avec l'application pratique sur le terrain, où tradition et
modernité seront mêlées pour rénover, améliorer et protéger l'existant de façon
coordonnée.</p>

<p>I am 25 years old and I am supporting a French NGO currently working on deploying a beautiful project full of meaning and hope...  </p>
<p>Les Apprentis de l'Espérance, is a cultural NGO for social development. They are setting up an eco-friendly volunteering worksite taking place in Rio De Janeiro <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">in association with SUSTENTARTE, NGO specialist in eco-friendly construction and environemental education, and ICADC (Instituto para Desenvolvimento e Comunicaçâo),</span><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">an NGO involved since 1989 in intercultural and youth exchanges.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>The concept:</h2>
<p>O Jardim de Gaya aspires to become a host venue and a place focused on cultural and <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">technical exchanges in the fields of environmental education and social tourism. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">The project is focused on converting O Jardim de Gaya, a fisherman's house, located in the middle of an ecological reserve,into an </span>Eco<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">-friendly touristic house (for about 20 people). In the </span>medium<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;""> term, the goal is giving autonomy to this place of living by offering </span>accommodation<span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">, restauration and animation of social, cultural and environmental activities...</span></p>
<p>Renovating and livening up the site will be a source of local employment and emancipation (positions for managing the organisation and all the activities).</p>

<h4>Utility of my mission:</h4>
<p>-  Helping local development (positions opening in the mid-term)</p>
<p>-  Supporting the autonomy, the animation and the sustainability of a multipurpose center</p>

<p>I gathered my savings for reaching my ambition, and for getting ready to this amazing Eco-friendly adventure... That represents a real challenge. </p>
<p>I am self-financing my round trip ticket and my accommodation expenses.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p>                                                         <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/393740/files/20140225085706-descarga.jpg?1393347426"" src="""" style=""width: 124.01652892561982px; height: 122px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>However, I still need to collect <b><i>3000 euros </i></b>to carry out in advance the organization and coordination of the work-site:</p>
<p>-  Purchased set of tools and equipment necessary to the cleaning up and layout of the garden (1400 m2): </p>
<p>1 lawn-mower, 1 brush cutter, 1 pruner, 1 hedge trimmer, common small tools (pruning shears,  shears, billhooks, dibbles, greenhouses, etc.).</p>
<p>-  Participated shared expenses (food, water, electricity, Internet, etc.), supported local team on site.</p>
<p>-  Location scouting for making a documentary to record our action.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Each and every input is critical, it is a grain of sand for the multipurpose Eco-friendly center achievement. <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">If I could not reach the expected 3000 euros, what will be collected will allow us to carry on this project anyway, slower but for sure!</span></p>
<p></p>
<p>The reality is that the complete budget for creating this project is evaluated to be around 60 000 euros. <span style=""font-size: 15px; line-height: 1.45em;"">If the good will of you all follows us, and we over-achieve the amount of 3000 euros,it would pay for buying Eco-friendly tools in order to guarantee the renovation of the existing structure (fisherman's house) and the construction of a pavilion, oven and dry restrooms in bamboo and mud, hydroelectric adjustment, etc.</span></p>

Bonjour à tous!

J'ai 25 ans et je participe à ce magnifique projet plein de sens et générateur d'espoir... Les Apprentis de l'Espérance, association culturelle pour le développement social, développe actuellement un chantier ecovolontaire qui prend racine à Rio
de Janeiro en collaboration avec SUSTENTARTE, Ong spécialiste en Eco
construction et éducation environnementale, et l'Institut pour le Développement
et la Communication (ICADC), une Ong impliquée depuis 1989 dans la
promotion des jeunes et les échanges interculturels. L'idée:Il s'agit de reconvertir une maison de pêcheur, renommée le Jardim de Gaya, située dans une zone écologique protégée, en structure hôtelière à vocation éco touristique (20 couchages). À moyen terme, elle va acquérir son autogestion par de l'hébergement, de la restauration, de l'animation culturelle, de la production artisanale et le produit de ses manifestations. Une fois la structure mise aux normes, 10 emplois pourraient être créés pour maintenir l'accueil, l'animation et l'administration de la structure.                      Utilité de ma mission:
- 
Aider concrètement au
développement local (création d’emplois à moyen terme)
- 
Soutenir l'autonomie, l'animation
et la pérennité d'une structure d'accueil à vocation sociale et culturelle
- 
Promouvoir et participer à un
chantier international, ouvrant à une formation aux techniques bio
constructives, avec l'application pratique sur le terrain : création de
nouveaux talents pour de jeunes volontaires
- 
Apporter à une cause sociale et
environnementale mon savoir et expérience en commerce et marketing, et me réaliser à
travers cette initiative
- 
Contribuer à l’émancipation de
jeunes brésiliens(nnes)                                                                                     Dans quoi va partir ma contribution?J'ai réuni mes économies pour moyenner mes ambitions, et pour me préparer à cetteincroyable aventure qui m'attend... cela représente un vrai challenge personnel.Je m’autofinance pour payer mon billet aller-retour, mon hébergement sur
place (totalité du séjour).                 
Cependant, j’ai encore besoin de récolter 3000 euros pour coordonner en amont la mise en place du chantier:-  Achat d'outillage et matériel nécessaire aux travaux de nettoyage et aménagement du jardin (1400 m2): 1 tondeuse, 1 débrousailleuse, 1 élagueuse sur perche, 1 taille haie, petit outillage (sécateurs,  cisailles, serpes, fauchards, plantoirs, serre, bacs à semis…).
- 
Participation au tronc commun, soutien et accompagnement de l'équipe locale.-  Repérage pour réaliser une vidéo documentaire, témoignage de notre action.Chaque apport est un grain de sable considérable pour la réalisation de notre structure eco-touristique. Si je n'atteins pas les 3000 euros que j'espère, la somme récoltée permettra évidemment d'avancer quand même sur le projet, à pas plus lent, lent mais sûr!Dans les faits, la réalisation complète du projet est estimée à 60 000 euros. Si la bonne volonté de tous nous accompagne, et que nous excédions les 3000 euros, cela financera l'achat de matériaux écologiques, afin d'assurer la rénovation de la structure et construction d’un kiosque, four et toilettes sèches en bambou et terre crue, adaptation des structures hydro-électriques, etc. L'impact de notre projet:Intérêt du chantier est multiple. Il peut se décliner en trois points essentiels: 
1. Soutenir la viabilisation d'une structure d’accueil autogérée, dans un lieu
protégé, destinée à la mise en œuvre et à la diffusion de programmes de
sensibilisation et de formation spécifiques (Education à l’environnement, Agro
écologie, Ecotourisme)
SUSTENTARTE,
ONG spécialiste en Eco construction et éducation environnementale et l'ICADC impliqué
depuis 1989 dans la promotion des jeunes et les échanges interculturels seront
les garants de ce programme.  
2. Promouvoir un chantier international, ouvrant à une formation aux techniques
bio constructives, avec l'application pratique sur le terrain, où tradition et
modernité seront mêlées pour rénover, améliorer et protéger l'existant de façon
coordonnée.
A
savoir: - Permettre l'évacuation rationnelle des eaux usées- Reprendre et adapter les installations hydro-électriques au normes de sécurité- Viabiliser un grand salon polyvalent doté d'une couverture végétale pour des activités abritées- Construire un Kiosque, un four et des toilettes sèches en bambou- Nettoyer et aménager le jardin pour l'implantation d'espaces dédiés à la production organiqueThèmes abordés :- Le bambou : techniques structurelles, construction des éléments- La terre : Usages et techniques de construction (adobe, torchis et pisé), modélisation- La couverture végétale : alternative urbaine durable, étanchéité et finitions- Les peintures naturelles : développement et application élargir la capacité d'accueil 3. À terme: Contribuer à soutenir l'essor de la population locale par l'apprentissage et la formation des jeunes et des femmes, dans le cadre de programmes intégrés de préservation de l'environnment et d'économie solidaire, d'après les principes du développement durable.Valeurs écologiques:Niché au cœur. de la Réserve écologique et archéologique de
Guaratiba, sur la côte Ouest de Rio, O Jardim de Gaya est situé face à la
mangrove, non loin des immenses plages de Recreio et Grumari, dans la
fameuse Mata Atlântica (Forêt Atlantique). 
L’environnement est composé d’un écosystème
riche de plus de 200 000 espèces animales et végétales. C’est un lieu
privilégié pour la découverte et l’étude de la faune et de la flore.   Le site représente des caractéristiques
naturelles qui favorisent l’étude de l’écosystème et le développement de
l’Ecotourisme. D'autres façons d'aiderJ'espère de nombreuses participations pour soutenir ce challenge basé sur des valeurs sociales, environnementales et (inter)culturelles. J'espère être encouragée à poursuivre  et à concrétiser mon projet personnel.Si vous ne pouvez pas donner, mais mon projet vous touche, par sa valeur sociale, culturelle ou environnementale, faites-le connaître autour de vous. Beaucoup d'entreprises ont une politique RSE largement orientée vers le developpement social et le respect de l'environnement, parlez-leur de ma démarche! Si vous vous déplacez près de Rio, n'hésitez pas à venir nous voir. Partagez un projet solidaire!Toutes les participations sont les bienvenues. Je vous
remercie d'avance de votre soutien qui m'encourage à poursuivre. Un compte
rendu vous sera adressé sur demande pour vous permettre d'accompagner
l'évolution de mon entreprise. Qu'est-ce que nous vous proposons en échange?Voici les contreparties qui seront proposées par l'association:10 €Carte postale de la région ou de nos actions, envoyée à domicile20 €Carte postale de la région ou de nos actions + Marque page personnalisé envoyés à votre domicile 50 €Contrepartie précédente + Tshirt imprimé avec un motif exclusif issu de nos travaux ou paréo Brésil100 €Contreparties précédentes + Compte rendu trimestriel +  2 entrées au Jardim de Gaya pour une animation musicale aux chandelles OU BIEN 2 Tshirts personnalisés 200 €Contreparties précédentes +  2 entrées au Jardim de Gaya pour une animation musicale aux chandelles + 1 Nuit pour deux au Jardim de Gaya OU BIEN 2 Tshirts personnalisés + Objet design fabriqué par nos artisans 300 €Contreparties précédentes + 1 Costume de Carnaval, OU BIEN 2 Tshirts personnalisés + Objet design fabriqué par nos artisans + 1 tableau de Guaratiba peint par nos artistes500 €Contreparties précédentes+ Apparition de votre nom ou de votre logo sur tous nos supports de communication1000 €10 Cartes postales de la région ou de nos actions + 10 Marques page personnalisés + 2 Tshirt imprimé avec un motif exclusif issu de nos travaux + 2 Paréos Brasil + Objet design fabriqué par nos artisans + 1 grand tableau de Guaratiba peint par nos artistes + 1 Nuits pour deux au Jardim de Gaya + 1 diner avec animation musicale aux chandelles + 2 Entrées au Carnaval en costume + Apparition de votre nom ou de votre logo sur tous nos supports de communication                                                     



Hello everyone!



I am 25 years old and I am supporting a French NGO currently working on deploying a beautiful project full of meaning and hope...  
Les Apprentis de l'Espérance, is a cultural NGO for social development. They are setting up an eco-friendly volunteering worksite taking place in Rio De Janeiro in association with SUSTENTARTE, NGO specialist in eco-friendly construction and environemental education, and ICADC (Instituto para Desenvolvimento e Comunicaçâo),an NGO involved since 1989 in intercultural and youth exchanges.


The concept:
O Jardim de Gaya aspires to become a host venue and a place focused on cultural and technical exchanges in the fields of environmental education and social tourism. 
The project is focused on converting O Jardim de Gaya, a fisherman's house, located in the middle of an ecological reserve,into an Eco-friendly touristic house (for about 20 people). In the medium term, the goal is giving autonomy to this place of living by offering accommodation, restauration and animation of social, cultural and environmental activities...
Renovating and livening up the site will be a source of local employment and emancipation (positions for managing the organisation and all the activities).







Utility of my mission:
-  Helping local development (positions opening in the mid-term)
-  Supporting the autonomy, the animation and the sustainability of a multipurpose center
-  Promoting and participating in an international work-site, offering an Eco-friendly construction techniques training,together with practice in location: creation of new talents for young volunteers.
-  Bringing my educational background and experience in business and marketing area to a social cause/matter
-  Contributing to the local emancipation of Brazilian's youth                                                                                                                              

Where is my contribution going?
I gathered my savings for reaching my ambition, and for getting ready to this amazing Eco-friendly adventure... That represents a real challenge. 
I am self-financing my round trip ticket and my accommodation expenses.

                                                         

However, I still need to collect 3000 euros to carry out in advance the organization and coordination of the work-site:
-  Purchased set of tools and equipment necessary to the cleaning up and layout of the garden (1400 m2): 
1 lawn-mower, 1 brush cutter, 1 pruner, 1 hedge trimmer, common small tools (pruning shears,  shears, billhooks, dibbles, greenhouses, etc.).
-  Participated shared expenses (food, water, electricity, Internet, etc.), supported local team on site.
-  Location scouting for making a documentary to record our action.

Each and every input is critical, it is a grain of sand for the multipurpose Eco-friendly center achievement. If I could not reach the expected 3000 euros, what will be collected will allow us to carry on this project anyway, slower but for sure!

The reality is that the complete budget for creating this project is evaluated to be around 60 000 euros. If the good will of you all follows us, and we over-achieve the amount of 3000 euros,it would pay for buying Eco-friendly tools in order to guarantee the renovation of the existing structure (fisherman's house) and the construction of a pavilion, oven and dry restrooms in bamboo and mud, hydroelectric adjustment, etc.







The concerns of this project are multiple:




* Supporting the promotion and animation of O Jardim deGaya as a lasting  and sustainable project.• Giving the opportunity to youth and families to participate actively in the social, cultural and economic development of their region, a hotel and tourism eco paid business                                                                                                                                
•Encouraging education, learning, training andresearch, and support the discovery andpreservation of biodiversity                                                  •Accommodating a public eager to discover and experience Brazilian cities differently and foster international cooperation•Strengthening the participation of local schools and communities•Settig up artisanal workshops to expand the solidarity trade (recycling, jewelry, crafts, cooking)•Enhaninge direct and indirect job creation, related to the services provided in support of the structure                                                   •Transfering knowledge and know-how through the exchange of information and ecological experience (SUSTENTARTE):> BAMBOO : structural techniques, construction of elements.> CLAY : uses and techniques of building up (adobe and cob), models.> VEGETAL COVERING : urban sustainable alternative, impermeability, completion.> NATURAL PAINTS : developing and applying.•Organizing excursions to discover the ecosystem,flora and fauna of the region
                                                         •In a longer term, establishing an economically viable business with theconstruction and equipment of a rural guest house, by 2014 (World Cup Football)

I
intend to launch a new business model, in the Fast Food segment,
involving the automated
production of hamburger snacks, operating in a fully independent way
from the human aid, where the person, who wants to eat a healthy and
natural food being quickly prepared, at the time of locating a Dad´s
Burger machine, will get his/her snack in a few seconds, into a fully
hygienic packaging and at a very affordable price.












The
			difference of this project, as compared with other ones in the
			same segment, in addition to the social call regarding the
			contribution to the Social Inclusion of destitute
			people, also refers to the proposal of offering, in the market, a
			natural and differentiated product.










We
			make available to the consumer two options of Hamburgers, being
			the Vegetarian Hamburger and the Hamburger of Meat and Legumes,
			similar to the traditional one, both produced
			by using organic ingredients.







What
We Need and What
You Get
We
will launch a new business model; we will manufacture or buy Fast
Food machines that produce hamburger snacks in an automated way,
having capacity to produce
more than 200 units per hour; they will operate in a fully
independent way from the human aid, where the person who wants to eat
a healthy and natural food, having fast preparation, at the time of
locating one of these machines performs the selection of what he/she
wants to eat, closes the order by paying with an electronic card and
upon the confirmation of the payment, the Dad´s Burger machine
prepares the snack in a few seconds, packages it and delivers it to
the final consumer into a fully hygienic wrapping.
                                  
It
is included in the solution the implementation of the sales of
franchises of the machines, in order to speed up the amortization of
the undertaking, aiming
at the expansion of the business model.

According to the Euromonitor
consulting firm, the fast food market reached
sales amounting to BRL 55 billion in the year 2011, and it must grow
as per the 56% rhythm up to 2016. Within this scenario, the main
networks of food franchises in Brazil, at the present time, April 19,
2013, have 3,100 restaurants and they already have plans to grow
almost twice up to 2016, with the inauguration of additional 2,500
units.

Source:
http://www.nl.com.br/blog/uncategorized/mercado-de-fast-food-deve-crescer-56-ate-2016/













It
			is a market that has exponential growth
			rates, not just in Brazil, but in any location world-wide. Each
			passing day, the people are performing more activities and they
			need natural and healthy food, at an affordable price and prepared
			in a very short time.



When an
investor buys a machine with franchise and installs it at a shopping
center, the sole concern that he/she should have refers to the
amortization period of his/her investment, according to two possible
scenarios as follows:



Supposing
	the installation scenario of 1 machine at the food area of the
	shopping center, reaching daily sales of 100 hamburger units per
	day, 14 months would be necessary to amortize the investment
	regarding the acquisition of a machine with franchise. In this
	scenario, the sales revenue, of the replenishment inputs for the
	installed machine, will allow to help 2 families of 4 persons (or,
	that is to say, a couple with two siblings) per month.



Supposing
	the sales scenario of 500 units per day, the amortization would
	occur in 3 months, allowing to help up to 10 families per month with
	the sales of the inputs.

The
Impact

What
is the relationship of the Fast Food Project with the EAP Project?
It is useless just having the willingness to help these persons,
taking them out from the place where they live and moving them to
another place, if they continue living in their present way,
vegetating, being considered as worms of the society.







In
			order to really help, we need to awaken in them the sense of the
			life, to generate
			positive expectations and to recover the moral and family values.
			This goes beyond the theoretical philosophy, with respects, but it
			actually implies becoming involved, making that things happen.
Consequently,
			if we take out these persons from the streets, moving them to a
			place where they will really be able to be somebody, contributing,
			mutually collaborating, seeing their efforts and the fruits from
			them, they will help others, who are still in the situation that
			they lived in the past, informing them that, at the new times,
			there are expectations of a better life, we might not have the
			best professionals in the business field but, at least, those ones
			more committed and involved to make things happen and to achieve
			success.










Regarding
the latest project that I coordinated, producing a generator of
alternative and clean electric power, we started in January 2008,
nobody believed, I sold many of the assets that I owned and by
getting a partner, we finished the first prototype in 2009; I thought
that at that time I could implement my dream, but I had a deception.
I
thought that the reason could be the fact that the system had limited
autonomy, we continued the improvements, we got additional financial
resources, very recently, at the end of 2013, the latest prototype, a
45 kva generator worked, without interruptions, along 24 hours,
without the use of outside electric power, with self sustenance, I
thought that I had reached the right time, there was no way not to
have success, but I had another disappointment. If the technological
secret is not disclosed, nobody wants to help, everybody wants to
know just how the piece of equipment works, regardless the result
that it will generate.
                                                                                  EIP Generators










And
			time goes one and the persons, who live in the streets
			in situations of risks, continue dying; I do not like seeing a
			children begging money in the street, it is very difficult to
			endure it, consequently, thinking about these persons, I got the
			motivation and the inspiration to develop this solution and, with
			your help, I am sure that we will be able to jointly perform
			something very important and that our sons/daughters and
			grandsons/daughters will have the pride of informing that their
			parents and grandparents helped to make a better world for
			destitute persons.


Other
ways to help

If
you cannot
contribute involving money, but you believe in our proposal, you can
then collaborate divulging our project to your network of contacts.
These persons count on your help, we also count on your support
We
will prepare Fast Food by using organic ingredients

The Dad´s Burger Fast Food is a new proposal
to supply healthy food, prepared by the utilization of organic
ingredients and, at the same time, being an innovative way to fight
the poverty.

Our
vision is to generate a business model that allows the generation of
enough income so as groups of unhelped
persons and families can produce food having a differentiated quality
and having an assured demand by consumers who know that we are
contributing to the fight against the social inequality. 

                             It
is a medium-term project, but it is fully possible to be implemented.
In
the short term, we will perform the training of the business partners
for the certification of the processes regarding the production of
the food ingredients and the preparation of the food, while this will
occur, we will be getting new investors in order to start the
acquisition or the manufacturing of an automated hamburger machine.
We will also be preparing the place and the infrastructure to receive
the unhelped persons by means of partnerships with the existing
Street Dwellers Associations; we will perform the selection of the
persons who want to get out from their present situation and, in this
way, having persons already predisposed do collaborate, we will
increase the success chances of the undertaking and, later on, these
persons will be useful to be witnesses for other street dwellers so
as they also adhere to the proposal.

Summing
up...  We
want to build a better world!
   DAD’S
BURGER

Do
You Want To Become a Part in this?

This
is your chance to
literally become a part of the new generation of fast food! 

The
supporters of this campaign may get the
respective face picture printed on the side of the fast food machine
and have his/her name and photo in the Internet site of the
collaborators who not only believed in the proposal, but worked to
make it happen.
                    Why we do need your
money
Let
us talk truth ... 

Hamburger
machines do not work without food
ingredients, 


which
are not produced just by themselves.

The
people do not work for free,

Regarding
any activity to be performed, money is needed!
Developing
the Project of the Fast Food Machine for the automated production of
hamburgers and the EAP (Education Alliance Project) for Social
Inclusion is something that will really require high investments.
We
initially forecast the need of US$ 10,000 to get started the
structuring of the commercial partners, the preparation of the
professional training environment, the hiring of the consulting firms
for the certification
as regards to the preparation of the food to be production, and the
drafting of the business plan to attract investors.
In
case that we reach the amount of US$ 100,000.-,
we will be able to start the structuring and to buy or manufacture a
machine for the automated production of hamburgers.
If
we reach or surpass the US$ 400,000
goal, it will be possible to mount the pilot project that will allow
us to define the franchise model and thus speed up the expansion of
the undertaking.

Why
we will be successful where others
fail
In
addition to the Social Call referred to the Social Inclusion of
destitute people, the
proposal is to offer a differentiated product in the market.







We make available to
			the consumers two options of Hamburgers, being the Vegetarian
			Hamburger and the one of meat and legumes, similar to the
			Traditional, both produced by using organic ingredients.







For
the production of Organic Food, it is not allowed to use of
substances that generate risks to the human
health and the environment. Soluble synthetic fertilizers, agrotoxic
and transgenic agents are not utilized.
In
order to be considered as being organic, the product must be
elaborated at an
environment of organic production, where it is utilized, as the basis
of the production process, the agroecological principles that take
into account the responsible use of the soil, the water, the air and
the other natural resources, respecting the social and cultural
relationships.












The utilization of the “green
			manuring” will also be applied; it refers to working with
			the plants of the leguminous family and to gather green leaves
			from those plants, which favors the decomposition process.


The
leguminous plants have the capacity to take out
nitrogen from the atmosphere but, in order to complete the process,
they get linked to the bacteria that are in the soil and it gives
them an autonomy regarding the quality of the nutrients that the
other plants have not and need.







It is planned to get
			the certification by entities that perform the analyses of the
			food production processes in order to verify and give guidelines,
			if it is necessary, regarding the procedures to be implemented
			aimed at eliminating the risks of contamination of the food as,
			standing out the quality of the products elaborated and the
			quality in the preparation of the food up to the delivery to the
			final consumers.







Implementation
of the best practices as pointed out in the Process of Food Control
Quality world-wide known as EUREPGAP:



The 
	EUREPGAP Protocol is a Quality Control System that has the purpose
	of conciliating the rules and the procedures for the development of
	the Best Agricultural and Cattle-Breeding Practices;



EUREPGAP (Euro-Retailer Produce
	Working Group - EUREP) was
	organized, in 1997, as an initiative of the European retailer
	merchants and supermarkets, by the Protocol of Good Agricultural
	Practices – GAP for Fruits and Vegetables. Later on, the
	following Protocols were developed: Flowers and Ornaments,
	Aquiculture, Coffee and Integrated Assurance of Ranches/Farms
	(Cattle-Breeding and Extensive Tillages;



The main purpose of the EUREPGAP
	is to reduce the risks linked to the consumption of food, assuring
	the quality and the inocuity of this food in the primary production.
	The stages of the food processing are not reached by the EUREPGAP;



In addition to that, the EUREPGAP
	Protocol is based on a
	management system focused on the Continuing Improvement, which
	stimulates the rural producer to improve his/her management and
	production systems;



The principles of the EUREPGAP
	Program are based on the following concepts: Safety of the Food,
	Health, Safety and Well-Being at the Work, Protection to the
	Environment, Well-being of the Animals;



In order to demonstrate their
	commitment, the producers must be able:



to keep
		up the trust of the consumers as regards to the quality and the
		safety of the food;



to minimize
		the impacts to the Environment, preserving the nature and the wild
		life;



to reduce the use of agrotoxic
		agents;



to improve the efficiency in the
		use of the natural resources;



to assure the responsibility and
		the attitudes towards the safety and the
		health of the workers. 




Regarding
the Fast Food business model, it will be 100% automated, without the
need of the intervention of an employee to collect, another one to
prepare the food and another one to deliver the product to the final
consumer, in addition to the smaller
area required for the installation, generating a minimum reduction of
costs in the range of BRL 50,000 per month (BRL 20,000 with the
functional machine and BRL 30,000 with rent) or BRL 600,000 per year.

It will be necessary to hire just one
professional to be responsible for performing the logistics process
referred to the daily delivery and replenishment of the food
ingredients/inputs in the machine, in order to meet the demand.    ...::

The ImpactKnowing the difference your contribution will make:
Home is where it starts and where we always are supposed to feel safe. Every father or mother strives to shelter those they love. The sooner people can safely shelter their loved ones the sooner they can focus on rebuilding their community.

Funding will be provided to families as needed to provide critical structural repairs  and basic materials (Concrete, Timber, Steel and Roofing) as a first priority. 

All monies will continue to only be handled by trusted persons of the highest integrity to ensure there is no fraud or waste.

This project being realized is one of the most expedient and direct ways of delivering people to safe and sanitary conditions and providing protection from future storms. 
This project is about selflessness and trust. 


Some funds have been already been privately received and committed to tools needed for construction and power generation.

<p>Hi, my name is Greg Loomar and
my company is EzBizDocs. I have managed my own law firm in the South
Florida area for over 20 years and have been helping people and businesses
succeed in commercial and business transactions.  Two years ago I decided
to create EzBizDocs.com, an online business marketplace where people could
visit and purchase EzBizDocs DIY business forms and personal documents, in
addition to searching for professional assistance with legal, accounting, real
estate and various other business and personal situations. Our Team needs your

**UPDATE :  We need more than our initial goal! Any dollar raised beyond the first goal helps us reduce our loan of $150,000- and we really need to do that.  And, any funds beyond that (let's be crazy optimists!  Why not?) would go to actually equip the kitchen!  So - let's blow right past our goal with this final momentum!

The Historic Walter Schmidt Tavern was built in 1893 and is located at 1848 W. Fond du Lac Ave. in Milwaukee’s Lindsay Heights
neighborhood. Wally and
Belle Schmidt ran the joint from 1935 to 1968. The tavern
was famous for its steak sandwiches and fish fries. It was also a favorite hangout spot for Milwaukee's politicians and ballplayers alike -  famous Braves baseball player Warren Spahn held his son's birthday parties here (For more read about it in the newpaper story posted under the Gallery tab).  In 1968, the McCarthy family leased the tavern and renamed it Max & Mildred’s (Later M & M Lounge).  The lounge closed in 2010 and has been
vacant since.







Much of the tavern’s original historic features are still in place, including a patterned hex-tile floor, finished wood molding and millwork, the historic bar, wrought ironwork, and embossed glass in the tavern’s entry door. Exterior features include a terra cotta roof, leaded glass windows, and decorative Mission Revival style piers. 




Juli Kaufmann (www.fixdevelopment.com) and Jeremy Davis have joined as partners to reclaim the building for a new sit-down restaurant on the first floor and offices on the second floor.  Juli has developed lots of local real estate recognized for its social and environmental impact.  She has also co-founded a pioneering crowdfundng vehicle called Fund Milwaukee where regular Milwaukeeans invest in local businesses and real estate.  Jeremy is a Lindsay Heights resident and works for Walnut Way Conservation Corp (www.walnutway.org), bringing extensive experience in community development both locally and globally. 



Duh.  This is an abandoned, foreclosed building that has suffered fire damage and vandalism.  It's located in Milwaukee's lowest income neighborhood. Overcoming these challenges will make success so much sweeter.  



We are bringing back the Wally Schmidt Tavern so that it can catalyze economic investment in the neighborhood, support three new small businesses, create local jobs, and make positive change.



In the Lindsay Heights neighborhood, systematic disinvestment has created a downward economic spiral - leaving a neighborhood that traditional investors and financial instutions now ignore.  Where homes and businesses once created a vibrant community, foreclosures have now reached a crisis level and more than half of commercial properties currently stand vacant.   




While these statistics evidence complex challenges, there is also tremendous potential. Many residents, businesses and partners are now successfully working together to begin transforming the community. 









Mentorship:  An experienced developer (Juli) partners with a local resident (Jeremy) to enable skill transfer and capacity building through hands-on learning embedded right in the neighborhood.



Community-identified
economic development needs:  The Lindsay Heights neighborhood residents have identified this building and the proposed uses as high priorities to have catalytic impact on the neighborhood.



Direct investment by community residents, and
sustained community ownership: Local residents will participate as investors using a crowdfunding ownership model and local businesses are sought as tenants to ensure local wealth-building, local job creation, and local economic impact.  
If you'd like this model explained in more detail, just ask us because we'd love to tell you.  This is our secret sauce!   This project will cost $500,000 and here's some good news. We've already raised much of it!  We have a loan, we have some investors, we have some grants, and we have our own real money and sweat equity.  We also have lease commitments for three of the four tenant spaces.

<h1>Our aims and goals for Recovery Walk Ireland</h1>
<p>We want to reach out to the community (indeed the global
community) as a whole and make this an all-island affair and together celebrate
Recovery. We hear plenty about addiction in the media (and often in our own
lives) and want to balance that with proof that Recovery is possible and real
and happens every day right here in our community and across the world. We want a
platform to celebrate Recovery not just for individuals in Recovery, but for
their families, friends and the whole community. We aim to:</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Celebrate and support recovery</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Promote the positive impact of recovery on
individuals, families and the community</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Remove the stigma surrounding addiction.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/704799/files/20140709055636-musician.jpg?1404910596"" src="""" style=""width: 588px; height: 881px;""/></p><br/><p></p>
<h1>Why we need funding?</h1>
<p>Unlike our
USA friends, recovery in Ireland is still often buried under shame and stigma
and we have been unsuccessful in getting corporate sponsorship, so we are
seeking help from you, our global community, to help make the 2014 event a
reality. </p>
<p>Everyone
involved in organising the event is an unpaid volunteer, and even though we
keep costs to an absolute minimum, they do exist e.g. insurance, hiring a sound
system, security, portaloos, printing costs, and so on. This is our 3<sup>rd</sup>
year and we need YOU to make it a reality. We hope that whether you are in Recovery or not, you will join us in

<p><span>Located amidst an array

small church. The area is far from affluent and is comprised of mostly

that reads, “Raising a baby with a disability as a single mother is never an
easy task. But before you decide to give up, open this handle and let us try.”

winter morning in 2007 when Reverend Lee received a call just before dawn. The

over him. Reverend Lee rushed outside to find a box that reeked of fish with a
baby wrapped in a blanket inside. It was so cold that the baby was nearly
frozen and there was a large cat lurking around because it had caught the scent
of the fish. It was then that Reverend Lee decided, if he can’t prevent parents
from abandoning their children, he can at least guarantee them a loving home
and safety under his roof. And that is how “Babybox” came to be. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1003490/files/20141110191642-baby1.jpg?1415675802"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

For example, we can sell you a trip in South Africa for USD 2 400 (€ 2 000). <br/></i></p><p><i>Meeting locals and other travellers are a key point of our vision. Moreover, we think that accommodations should give something to improve you trip: originality, situation, charm or favouring the sharing of experiences. We tested accommodations and we validated with these criteria. <br/></i></p><p><i>We travelled in Southern Africa as backpackers many times (9 months): by foot, by bicycle, by hitch hiking, by typical means of transports and by car. We tested different sort of accommodations: homestay, guest houses, B&amp;B, backpackers, lodges, campsites...

<h1>Our project</h1>
<p>
</p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">We want to launch a
tour operator specialized in Southern Africa. We will sell trips only
via the internet (without physical agency). All our trips will be
tailor-made: each trip is unique and is designed with the customer.
We ensure that the trip matches with the customer. Each trip will
include car rental, accommodations and activities. The accommodations
will be mostly backpackers, guest houses and bed &amp; breakfasts.
The key point for the accommodation is to give more to the
experience: originality, situation, conducive to meet people.
Activities will be booked directly with us. We will offer affordable
trips: we will work directly with our local partners.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1153211/files/20150116030229-maxilogo.jpg?1421406149"" src="""" style="""" title=""Our logo""/></p>

</ul><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p>Since 2010, we have
been working on this project. We went a 1<sup>st</sup> time in South
Africa and in Swaziland in 2010 to discover these countries. In 2013
and 2014, we came back in Southern Africa during 7 months to meet
trusted partners for the different services we will offer. We are
sure that there is an unexploited potential in these countries for a
different tourism, matching with our vision.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1153219/files/20150116030817-0347_Wynberg_-_Station_de_Taxi_ann_e_2010_taille_normale.JPG?1421406497"" src="""" style="""" title=""We are in the suburb of Cape Town""/></p><br/><p></p>
<a name=""OurVision"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>
<h1>Our vision</h1>
<p>We noted that the
trips offered in Southern Africa by the travel agencies are generally
the same and don't really facilitate discovering the countries.
Moreover, they are expensive compared with the cost of living.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We will offer the
opportunity to discover unusual sites, off the beaten track. We will
use our experiences and knowledge of this part of the world. We will
favor meeting and sharing with locals and other travellers. This is a
key point of our vision because we think that a trip has to allow a
personal enrichment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Southern Africa is
not really known to everyone. Security of our customers will be the
heart of our services. That's why we decided to really explore these
countries and to work with trusted partners.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, the
confidence of our customers is essential. Nobody is protected from a
negligence of the tour operator, in particular on the internet.
That's why, we will operate as follow: when we will receive the
payment from our customers, we will pay immediately our partners to
finalize the booking. You can think that it is normal and logical but
usually tour operators pay their partners periodically (for example:
one time by quarter). This way can cause debts that the tour operator
can't cover and the customer risks to have no accommodation... That's
why we want to subscribe to a financial guarantee for an amount of
€200 000. This guarantee will be subscribe to cover the debts in
case of problems. With us, the customer can't have unpleasant
surprises!</p>

the country: big cities, malls and vineyards. Nevertheless, the
amazing landscapes, the traditions that are always there, or the
architecture of the colonial buildings will remind you that you are
in Africa. Moreover, Western Cape have a rich history, from the
arrival of the first settlers (visits of old buildings such as the
Castle of Good Hope) to the end of the apartheid (visit of Robben
Island, former jail of Nelson Mandela) and the current story (visit
of a township).</p><p>For more information about this trip, you can download the detailed brochure <a href=""http://www.echappee-australe.com/doc/brochure_pack1_en.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1153235/files/20150116031555-broch1.jpg?1421406955"" src="""" style="""" title=""Western Cape by car""/></p><br/>

<a name=""Risks"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a>
<h1>What are the risks?</h1>
<p>
The tourism industry is very regulated in France. It permit to protect the customer. The conditions to open a tour operator are:</p><ul>
<li>Skills: a diploma in tourism and experiences. This condition is validated through Amandine.
</li>
<li>A financial guarantee: it permit to cover the customer. This is the raison d'etre of our crowdfunding campaign. The amount depends on the organization of the tour operator (society, association, …).</li>
</ul><b>1. If we will not reach our campaign's goal?</b><br/>We will do our best to open our tour operator. We have different financial solutions. Moreover, we can open our company as an association: nothing will change for our customers and we will have less charges.
<br/><br/><b>2. If we will not have a financial guarantee?</b><br/>This is our biggest problem. We believe in our project and our close relations follow us: to obtain the guarantee, they will provide 200 000€ (via there properties). If we can't have this guarantee, we will do our best to reimburse donations.

<br/><br/>Please, tell us if you think that there are other risks.

<h1>Notre projet</h1>
<p>
</p><p>Nous avons pour
projet d'ouvrir un tour-opérateur spécialisé sur l'Afrique
Australe. Nous vendrons nos voyages uniquement sur internet (pas
d'agence physique). Les voyages seront à la carte : chaque
voyage est unique et est élaboré avec le client afin qu'il lui
corresponde. Les voyages seront composés des prestations suivantes :
location d'une voiture, logements et activités. Les logements seront
principalement des backpackers, des guest houses et des bed &amp;
breakfasts. L'important pour nous est que le logement apporte un vrai
plus à l’expérience : originalité, positionnement ou tout
simplement un lieu propice aux rencontres et au partage. Les
activités pourront être directement réservées avec nous. Nous
souhaitons proposer des voyages à des tarifs abordables : nous
ne passerons pas par des intermédiaires.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1153270/files/20150116033015-maxilogo.jpg?1421407815"" src="""" style="""" title=""Notre logo""/></p><br/>

travaillons sur ce projet de tour opérateur. Nous sommes ainsi
partis une 1e fois en Afrique du Sud et au Swaziland en 2010 pour
connaître ces pays. En 2013 et 2014, nous sommes retournés pendant
7 mois en Afrique Australe dans le but de trouver les partenaires
fiables pour les différentes prestations que nous proposerons. Nous
sommes ainsi certains qu'il y a un potentiel inexploité dans ces pays

<h1>Notre vision</h1>
<p>
</p><p>Nous sommes partis
du constat suivant : les voyages proposés en Afrique Australe
par les agences de voyages sont tous les mêmes et ne permettent pas
de véritablement connaître les pays. De plus, ils sont généralement
assez chers compte tenu du coût de la vie de ces pays.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nous voulons
proposer la découverte de lieux insolites et réellement hors des
sentiers battus. Nous nous basons sur nos expériences et nos
connaissances de cette région du monde. Nous voulons privilégier
les rencontres et les échanges, que ce soit avec les populations
locales ou avec les autres voyageurs. Nous pensons que le voyage doit
être un enrichissement personnel, c'est pourquoi ce point nous est
important.</p>
<p>
</p><p>L'Afrique Australe
n'est pas forcément une région très connue. La sécurité de nos
clients sera au cœur de nos prestations. C'est pourquoi nous avions
décidé de réellement explorer ces pays et de travailler avec des
partenaires en qui nous pouvons avoir confiance. 
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Enfin la confiance
du client est primordiale. Personne n'est à l'abri d'un manquement
de son voyagiste, en particulier sur internet. Pour éviter tout
problème, notre mode de fonctionnement sera le suivant : dès
que nous recevrons l'argent du client, nous le reverserons à nos
prestataires afin de finaliser la transaction. Cela peut sembler
logique mais, bien souvent, les versements de l'argent aux
prestataires s'effectuent par période (par exemple : tous les
trois mois). Cela peut entraîner des dettes que le voyagiste ne
serait pas en mesure de couvrir et le client risque de se retrouver
sans logements une fois dans le pays… L'autre aspect de cette
confiance sera de souscrire à une garantie financière à hauteur de
200 000€. Cette garantie aura pour objectif de payer les dettes en
cas de manquement de l'entreprise. Le client n'aura donc aucune
mauvaise surprise avec nous !</p>

<h1>Quels sont les risques pour ce projet?</h1>
<p>
Le secteur du tourisme en France est très réglementé. L'objectif est de protéger au maximum le consommateur. Les conditions pour ouvrir un tour-opérateur sont les suivantes:</p><ul>
<li>La compétence: un diplôme reconnu dans le tourisme et de le l'expérience. Cette condition est remplie grâce à Amandine. <br/>
</li>
<li>Obtenir une garantie financière dont le montant varie selon la forme du tour-opérateur (société, association, etc.). C'est la raison de notre campagne de financement participatif. Cette garantie a pour but de couvrir les clients face aux défaillances éventuelles de l'entreprise. </li>
</ul><b>1. Si nous n'atteignons pas notre objectif de campagne?</b><br/>Nous ferons tout pour ouvrir notre tour-opérateur. Nous avons d'autres solutions financières viables. De plus, une solution consiste à ouvrir notre agence sous forme d'association: cela ne changera rien pour nos clients mais de notre côté les coûts sont moindres.
<br/><br/><b>2. Si nous n'obtenons pas la garantie financière?</b><br/>Il s'agit de notre principal obstacle. Nous croyons réellement en notre projet et nos proches y croient également: pour obtenir la garantie financière, ils s'engagent à hauteur de 200 000€ (par des biens immobiliers). Si malgré tout, nous n'obtenions pas cette garantie, nous nous engageons à rembourser au mieux les dons perçus (à 90% de leur valeur, Indiegogo prenant environ 10% des dons).

<br/><br/>Si vous voyez d'autres risques, n'hésitez pas à nous en faire part afin que nous les étudiions.

Make your trips a
personal enrichment: Échappée Australe, future tour operator.
Do you think that a price of USD 3 500 or USD 4 600 (€ 3 000 or € 4 000) for a 10 days trip in South Afria (for 2 people without fly tickets) is expensive?
Do you think that this price is expensive for trips offering hostel without charm?
You don't find travel agencies or tour operator offering trips truly off the beaten track? We encountered these problems. That's why we will launch a tour operator to sell affordable trips in Southern Africa and in the Indian Ocean islands. For example, we can sell you a trip in South Africa for USD 2 400 (€ 2 000). Meeting locals and other travellers are a key point of our vision. Moreover, we think that accommodations should give something to improve you trip: originality, situation, charm or favouring the sharing of experiences. We tested accommodations and we validated with these criteria. We travelled in Southern Africa as backpackers many times (9 months): by foot, by bicycle, by hitch hiking, by typical means of transports and by car. We tested different sort of accommodations: homestay, guest houses, B&B, backpackers, lodges, campsites... We practised too many unusual activities. We know the destinations that we offer and have been organized trips for friends: they really enjoyed!

Our project

We want to launch a
tour operator specialized in Southern Africa. We will sell trips only
via the internet (without physical agency). All our trips will be
tailor-made: each trip is unique and is designed with the customer.
We ensure that the trip matches with the customer. Each trip will
include car rental, accommodations and activities. The accommodations
will be mostly backpackers, guest houses and bed & breakfasts.
The key point for the accommodation is to give more to the
experience: originality, situation, conducive to meet people.
Activities will be booked directly with us. We will offer affordable
trips: we will work directly with our local partners.

About us

We are two people
working on this project:

Amandine
Deslangles who have a tourism degree in trips design and a
baccalaureate in accountancy and business management. She worked in
different travel agencies and tour operators.
Clément Pilchen,
having a master degree in projects management and innovation, managed
many projects in multiple sectors (building, pharmaceutical, business
launching) and worked during 2 years in IT.


Since 2010, we have
been working on this project. We went a 1st time in South
Africa and in Swaziland in 2010 to discover these countries. In 2013
and 2014, we came back in Southern Africa during 7 months to meet
trusted partners for the different services we will offer. We are
sure that there is an unexploited potential in these countries for a
different tourism, matching with our vision.

Our vision
We noted that the
trips offered in Southern Africa by the travel agencies are generally
the same and don't really facilitate discovering the countries.
Moreover, they are expensive compared with the cost of living.

We will offer the
opportunity to discover unusual sites, off the beaten track. We will
use our experiences and knowledge of this part of the world. We will
favor meeting and sharing with locals and other travellers. This is a
key point of our vision because we think that a trip has to allow a
personal enrichment.

Southern Africa is
not really known to everyone. Security of our customers will be the
heart of our services. That's why we decided to really explore these
countries and to work with trusted partners.

Finally, the
confidence of our customers is essential. Nobody is protected from a
negligence of the tour operator, in particular on the internet.
That's why, we will operate as follow: when we will receive the
payment from our customers, we will pay immediately our partners to
finalize the booking. You can think that it is normal and logical but
usually tour operators pay their partners periodically (for example:
one time by quarter). This way can cause debts that the tour operator
can't cover and the customer risks to have no accommodation... That's
why we want to subscribe to a financial guarantee for an amount of
€200 000. This guarantee will be subscribe to cover the debts in
case of problems. With us, the customer can't have unpleasant
surprises!

The awards
With
the crowdfunding, we offer you the opportunity to become our first
customers: you can have discounts for our future trips or you can
obtain an affordable trip in South Africa for 2 people.
 
For a donation of USD 50 (€ 43): We will send you a thank-you emailNo contribution are too short, and we really appreciate your support! That's why we will send you a personal email to thank you when the campaign will be finished. Moreover, we will tell you everything about the project's progress.
 
For a donation of USD 250 (€ 216): You will have a 5% discountTo have an idea of a 5% discount, we need to give you an example. The trip that we offer for a donation of USD 2 000 (€ 1 730 / Western Cape by car for 2 people) will cost approximately USD 2 400 (€ 2 000). In fact, when we will open our tour operator, we will have different charges and taxes. That's why the price of the trip will be more than the crowdfunding price.If you have a 5% discount, you will pay for this trip approximately USD 2 250 (€ 1 90).Please, note that it is an example. Your 5% discount will be available for the trip of your choice (including tailor-made trip) in Southern Africa and in islands of Indian Ocean.
 
For a donation of USD 500 (€ 432): You will have a 10% discountTo have an idea of a 10% discount, we need to give you an example. The trip that we offer for a donation of USD 2 200 (€ 1 900 / Eastern Cape by car for 2 people) will cost approximately USD 2 600 (€ 2 250). In fact, when we will open our tour operator, we will have different charges and taxes. That's why the price of the trip will be more than the crowdfunding price.If you have a 10% discount, you will pay for this trip approximately USD 2 300 (€ 2 000).Please, note that it is an example. Your 10% discount will be available for the trip of your choice (including tailor-made trip) in Southern Africa and in islands of Indian Ocean.
 
For
a donation of USD 2 000 (€ 1 730): You will discover the Western Cape (for 2
people).Normal price (once opened): USD 2 400 (€ 2000).
During
11 days, you will visit these cities: Cape Town, Hermanus, Struis
Bay, Arniston, Swellendam and Stellenbosch. We think this trip is
perfect to discover one of the most beautiful and famous South
African provinces.Western Cape is the most European province of
the country: big cities, malls and vineyards. Nevertheless, the

Faire de vos voyages
un enrichissement personnel : Échappée Australe, futur tour
opérateur.

Vous aussi vous trouvez que payer entre 3 000 et 4 000 euros pour passer 10 jours en Afrique du Sud à 2 (sans les billets d'avion), c'est cher? Vous aussi vous pensez que payer cette somme pour des voyages dans des hôtels sans charme, c'est cher? Vous n'arrivez pas à trouver des agences de voyages ou des voyagistes qui vous font réellement aller en dehors des zones touristiques ? Nous avons rencontré les mêmes problèmes. C'est pourquoi nous voulons ouvrir un tour-opérateur abordable pour vendre des voyages en Afrique Australe et vers les îles de l'Océan Indien.
A titre de comparaison, nous pouvons vous envoyer en Afrique du Sud pour 2 000 euros pour 2 personnes. Nous privilégions la rencontre avec les locaux et les autres voyageurs et tenons à ce que les logements apportent un plus au voyage : originalité, situation, charme ou favorisant les échanges d'expériences. Nous avons testé les logements que nous proposons et les avons validés en fonction de ces critères ! Nous avons traversé l'Afrique Australe en mode routard à plusieurs reprises (9 mois au total): à pieds, en vélo, en stop, en transports locaux et en voiture. Nous avons testé toutes sortes de logements : chez l'habitant, en guest houses, en B&B, en backpackers, dans des lodges, dans des camping… Nous avons également testé des activités originales. Nous connaissons les destinations que nous proposons et avons déjà organisé des voyages pour des amis : ils ont adoré !

Peut-on adapter les voyages que vous proposez selon nos envies ?

Notre projet

Nous avons pour
projet d'ouvrir un tour-opérateur spécialisé sur l'Afrique
Australe. Nous vendrons nos voyages uniquement sur internet (pas
d'agence physique). Les voyages seront à la carte : chaque
voyage est unique et est élaboré avec le client afin qu'il lui
corresponde. Les voyages seront composés des prestations suivantes :
location d'une voiture, logements et activités. Les logements seront
principalement des backpackers, des guest houses et des bed &
breakfasts. L'important pour nous est que le logement apporte un vrai
plus à l’expérience : originalité, positionnement ou tout
simplement un lieu propice aux rencontres et au partage. Les
activités pourront être directement réservées avec nous. Nous
souhaitons proposer des voyages à des tarifs abordables : nous
ne passerons pas par des intermédiaires.



Qui sommes nous?

Nous sommes deux
personnes sur ce projet : 


Amandine
Deslangles qui, après avoir obtenu un bac STG en comptabilité et
gestion des entreprises, a obtenu un diplôme Ventes et Productions
Touristiques. Elle a également plusieurs expériences en agence de
voyages et en tour opérateur.
Clément Pilchen,
diplômé d'une école d'ingénieurs spécialisés en gestion de
projet et innovation, a géré des projets dans des secteurs variés
(BTP, milieu pharmaceutique, aide en création d'entreprise) avant de
travailler 2 années dans le secteur informatique.



Depuis 2010, nous
travaillons sur ce projet de tour opérateur. Nous sommes ainsi
partis une 1e fois en Afrique du Sud et au Swaziland en 2010 pour
connaître ces pays. En 2013 et 2014, nous sommes retournés pendant
7 mois en Afrique Australe dans le but de trouver les partenaires
fiables pour les différentes prestations que nous proposerons. Nous
sommes ainsi certains qu'il y a un potentiel inexploité dans ces pays
pour un tourisme différent, en adéquation avec notre vision.



Notre vision

Nous sommes partis
du constat suivant : les voyages proposés en Afrique Australe
par les agences de voyages sont tous les mêmes et ne permettent pas
de véritablement connaître les pays. De plus, ils sont généralement
assez chers compte tenu du coût de la vie de ces pays.

Nous voulons
proposer la découverte de lieux insolites et réellement hors des
sentiers battus. Nous nous basons sur nos expériences et nos
connaissances de cette région du monde. Nous voulons privilégier
les rencontres et les échanges, que ce soit avec les populations
locales ou avec les autres voyageurs. Nous pensons que le voyage doit
être un enrichissement personnel, c'est pourquoi ce point nous est
important.

L'Afrique Australe
n'est pas forcément une région très connue. La sécurité de nos
clients sera au cœur de nos prestations. C'est pourquoi nous avions
décidé de réellement explorer ces pays et de travailler avec des
partenaires en qui nous pouvons avoir confiance. 


Enfin la confiance
du client est primordiale. Personne n'est à l'abri d'un manquement
de son voyagiste, en particulier sur internet. Pour éviter tout
problème, notre mode de fonctionnement sera le suivant : dès
que nous recevrons l'argent du client, nous le reverserons à nos
prestataires afin de finaliser la transaction. Cela peut sembler
logique mais, bien souvent, les versements de l'argent aux
prestataires s'effectuent par période (par exemple : tous les
trois mois). Cela peut entraîner des dettes que le voyagiste ne
serait pas en mesure de couvrir et le client risque de se retrouver
sans logements une fois dans le pays… L'autre aspect de cette
confiance sera de souscrire à une garantie financière à hauteur de
200 000€. Cette garantie aura pour objectif de payer les dettes en
cas de manquement de l'entreprise. Le client n'aura donc aucune
mauvaise surprise avec nous !



Les récompenses

Par le crowdfunding,
nous vous proposons de devenir client avant l'heure : que ce
soit par des réductions sur les voyages que nous vendrons ou tout
simplement par des voyages à prix réduits.
Nous proposons ainsi
de vous organiser des voyages en Afrique du Sud pour 2 personnes. 
 

Pour un don de 50 USD (43 €): Nous vous enverrons un email de remerciement Toute contribution est la bienvenue et nous aidera énormément. C'est pourquoi nous vous enverrons un email pour vous remercier, dès que la campagne de financement sera terminée. De plus, nous vous tiendrons informé de l'avancé de notre projet. 
 
Pour un don de 250 USD (216 €): Nous vous offrons une réduction de 5% Une fois notre tour opérateur ouvert, vous bénéficierez d'une réduction de 5% à valoir sur le voyage de votre choix (dont les voyages sur mesures) à destination de l'Afrique Australe et sur les îles de l'Océan Indien. Par exemple, le voyage que nous proposons actuellement pour un don de 2 000 USD (environ 1 730 € / Western Cape en voiture pour 2 personnes) coûtera environ 2 400 USD (environ 2 000 €). Cette différence provient des charges et taxes que nous auront une fois le tour opérateur ouvert. Avec votre réduction de 5%, vous pourrez bénéficier de ce voyage au prix de 2 250 USD (environ 1 900€). 
 
Pour un don de 500 USD (432 €): Nous vous offrons une réduction de 10% Une fois notre tour opérateur ouvert, vous bénéficierez d'une réduction de 10% à valoir sur le voyage de votre choix (dont les voyages sur mesures) à destination de l'Afrique Australe et sur les îles de l'Océan Indien. Par exemple, le voyage que nous proposons actuellement pour un don de 2 200 USD (environ 1 900 € / Eastern Cape en voiture pour 2 personnes) coûtera environ 2 600 USD (environ 2 250 €). Cette différence provient des charges et taxes que nous auront une fois le tour opérateur ouvert. Avec votre réduction de 10%, vous pourrez bénéficier de ce voyage au prix de 2 300 USD (environ 2 000€) .

 
Pour un don de 2 000
USD (1 730 €): Nous vous ferons découvrir le Western Cape (pour 2
personnes).Prix normal (une fois ouvert): 2 400 USD (2 000€).
Pendant 11 jours,
vous visiterez les villes suivantes: Cape Town, Hermanus, Struis Bay,
Arniston, Swellendam, Stellenbosch. Nous pensons que c'est l'idéal
pour découvrir sur une courte durée l'une des plus jolies et
célèbres régions d'Afrique du Sud.Le Western Cape est la
région la plus européenne du pays: des grandes villes, des centres
commerciaux, et des domaines viticoles. Vous n'en serez pas moins en
Afrique comme vous le rappelleront les paysages extraordinaires, les
traditions toujours présentes, ou encore l'architecture des
bâtiments d'époque. Le Western Cape, c'est également une région
riche en histoire, de l'arrivée des premiers colons (visites de
bâtiments d'époque comme le fort de Bonne Espérance) jusqu'à la
fin de l'apartheid (visite de Robben Island, ancienne prison de
Nelson Mandela), sans oublier l'histoire actuelle (visite d'un
township).Pour plus d'informations sur ce voyage, vous pouvez télécharger la brochure détaillée ici.
 
Pour un don de 2 200
USD (1 900 €): Nous vous ferons découvrir l'Eastern Cape (pour 2

vers la nature et vous emmènera dans des sites majestueux. Toutes
les activités d'extérieur sont possibles: randonnées, saut à
l'élastique (le plus haut du monde depuis un pont), accrobranche,
sandboard... Vous y trouverez forcément votre bonheur! C'est
également l'opportunité de découvrir la faune sud-africaine: un
safari dans un des plus beaux parcs du pays vous permettra d'observer
les Big
Five, ou une rencontre avec les manchots du cap, que
ce soit au hasard d'une sortie en bord de mer ou en visitant un
centre de réhabilitation qui leur est dédié. Enfin, nous vous
proposons d'en apprendre plus sur les traditions et sur le mode de
vie des locaux en séjournant dans un authentique village Xhosa:
immanquable! Pour plus d'informations sur ce voyage, vous pouvez télécharger la brochure détaillée ici.
 
Pour un don de 3 000
USD (2 590 €): Nous vous emmènerons de Cape Town à Port Elizabeth (pour
2 personnes).Prix normal (une fois ouvert): 3 500 USD (3 000€).

Quels sont les risques pour ce projet?

Le secteur du tourisme en France est très réglementé. L'objectif est de protéger au maximum le consommateur. Les conditions pour ouvrir un tour-opérateur sont les suivantes:
La compétence: un diplôme reconnu dans le tourisme et de le l'expérience. Cette condition est remplie grâce à Amandine. 

Obtenir une garantie financière dont le montant varie selon la forme du tour-opérateur (société, association, etc.). C'est la raison de notre campagne de financement participatif. Cette garantie a pour but de couvrir les clients face aux défaillances éventuelles de l'entreprise. 
1. Si nous n'atteignons pas notre objectif de campagne?Nous ferons tout pour ouvrir notre tour-opérateur. Nous avons d'autres solutions financières viables. De plus, une solution consiste à ouvrir notre agence sous forme d'association: cela ne changera rien pour nos clients mais de notre côté les coûts sont moindres.
2. Si nous n'obtenons pas la garantie financière?Il s'agit de notre principal obstacle. Nous croyons réellement en notre projet et nos proches y croient également: pour obtenir la garantie financière, ils s'engagent à hauteur de 200 000€ (par des biens immobiliers). Si malgré tout, nous n'obtenions pas cette garantie, nous nous engageons à rembourser au mieux les dons perçus (à 90% de leur valeur, Indiegogo prenant environ 10% des dons).

Si vous voyez d'autres risques, n'hésitez pas à nous en faire part afin que nous les étudiions.

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><h3>ONE YEAR LATER;</h3><p>I've been using the HECK out of that front end loader. You betcha! I can't thank you all enough. Here we are past the spring when Inidigogo launched their InDemand program and all of the rains - and we're into another drought - if you can believe that! Not any rain to speak of since June 30th - as I type this, it's October 11th. <br/></p><p>We lost a lot of ground to those floods, and fall is late to get planted due to the opposite problem now - no rain. <br/></p><p>I'm hanging in here - doing my best to make lemon meringue pie from the lemony weather. <br/></p><p>The pond is dry - and YES! I used the new loader to scoop up as much of the silt
 as I could. I ended up having to hire a 4wd tractor operator to really 
dig in and give it more depth. The pond is now 3' deeper in some areas. <br/></p><h4>
<b>I hate thieves</b><br/>
</h4><p>Last month, someone helped themselves to some of the equipment that is pertinent to the farm. <br/></p><p>The AC/DC inverter that allows me to pump water using the solar panels - those were nailed down, so they didn't steal them.  That's about $100</p><p>My beloved oiless air generator - with all of the tires around here - you have to have one of those! $60</p><p>So many of my hand tools - you know, hammers, screw drivers, channel locks, and all of the goodies that you accumulate in your handy dandy tool box - gone-ski! Some used tools have been donated to me from a few folks - thank you! But I'm still grabbing for that extra hack saw, big ol' pair of channel locks, and odds and ends nails, screws, nuts and bolts. Let's say - about $100 worth of stuff.</p><p>Another biggie they got was my old wood handled pick axe. I'm sure it was a vintage model, but it came in handy for breaking up hard ground. (I'm hoping the thief isn't going to use it to break in doors...) $50 - at least</p><p>55-gallon plastic barrels are not free. They used one of mine to cart a bunch of stuff off in! Yep! $70</p><p>My nerves have been a bit edgy and I'd sleep a bit better if I could have a decent security camera system installed. You know, the kind that films, AND calls you so you can call the cops ASAP.... or, go greet them with your shot gun. I've priced some and we're looking at at least $500+ for the solar powered; which I need since there's not any AC power past the pond - AND I like to be green.</p><p>Add a few solar powered pole spot lights - $45 ea</p><p>And if you can believe it, they even stole the dogs' stainless steel feed bowls! Those were not cheap! $15each</p><p>My official Red Rider carbine-action 200-shot range model BB rifle with a compass in the stock was also among the items swiped. Now I have a replacement from a friend - but I think it's time for a .410 pump action shot gun, don't you? $500</p><p>All in all, I'm lucky - they let me sleep. They didn't hurt the animals. Everything that was taken is more or less replaceable. Insurance doesn't hit till they get $2k in stuff. Insurance is in case the place burns to the ground - not for thieving punks. <br/></p><p>But add to this all of the lost crops from the spring floods - also not insurable on a small farm - and the slow summer sales and slow start to fall. Well, a boost of cash flow would be great. <br/></p><p>I'd still like to;</p><ul>
<li> Re-do the front yard into a free community garden. (See below under Last Fall) <br/>
</li>
<li>Put a solar system w/security cameras into the yurt for classes that require power/video, etc. and to keep it all safe. <br/>
</li>
<li>And I really need to hire someone to fix the barns, level the house and replace some rotting wood; upgrade the electrical all around this 100 yr old homestead and I've got a few roofs that need some real fixing that I am not going to be able to do this time. I've done repairs, but I think it's time for new. Let's estimate that at $1,000 <br/>
</li>
</ul><p>As always - anything you can muster up is appreciated. I've helped others over the summer with my tractor, pitched in my $25 - $200 for those in need where and when I could, and that's all because of your past generosity! <br/></p><p>We're all in this local food stuff together! Thanks! <br/></p><h3>Last Fall;</h3><p>Last fall, 74 or so very generous people helped the farm acquire a front end loader, ice maker, trailer and the budget for a walk-in cooler. <br/></p><p>The fine folks at Indiegogo unveiled a new idea recently, that allows you to continue to partner with the farm, even though the main fundraiser is over. It's called InDemand. <br/></p><p>A small, one person run farm like this one, is always in need of something - and it's usually something that wasn't in the budget.  Like;<br/></p><ul>
<li>a skilled repairman, <br/>
</li>
<li>a part to fix something that shouldn't have broken, <br/>
</li>
<li>fencing to keep out new neighbors' new flock of goats so they don't eat my garden, irrigation supplies to expand the edible forest, or <br/>
</li>
<li>other stuff that just plain wears out or breaks. <br/>
</li>
</ul><p>And right now with all of this rain, I'm worried about the foundation of both of the decades old barns and their leaky roofs! That's not going to be cheap to get fixed, and I'm not brave enough to jack up a 60+ year old barn by myself. LOL <br/></p><p>And lately, with the record flooding rains, many crops have been lost, which means, sales are lost, and the budget could really use a shot in the arm. <br/></p><p>Some projects I am working on include a Balch Springs, TX branch of the <a href=""http://foodisfreeproject.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Food is Free Project</a> community garden.  Basically, through volunteers and in any extra time I have, a garden is planted out in the front yard for members of the community, I'm thinking mostly it will be passersby, to eat from. So far, there are several fruit trees, a product of the last fund raiser's perk program, and the frame of a raised bed that will allow those with disabilities to access it. <br/></p><p>Here is a pic of the new loader being used to fill the bed with logs for <a href=""http://www.appropedia.org/Hugelkultur"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">hugelkultur</a>.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432520913/ftsypzprepcs8gev8hnf.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 355px; height: 355px;""/></p><p>So there's some expenses associated with that like plants, seeds, more edible perennials, some more wood for additional raised beds, (one of our volunteers found this wood!), and a little budget to be able to offer snacks, water, and lunch to our volunteers would be awesome, too. <br/></p><p>Also, in order to give our customers at the farmer's market held here a better selection of products, I'm working on the plans to put in a pallet-based covered porch on which a small chest freezer can sit for self-serve grass fed beef and pastured chicken purchases. So many small farmers are too busy to work more than 1 market, and I know this one isn't as busy as some, but our community needs good food, too.  Using pallets that I have access to through a vendor, will keep the costs down. But it would be nice to be able to compensate the handyman for his trips back and forth to help build it. Gas isn't free and he's on a fixed income. <br/></p><p>And so far, the utility, mortgage and insurance company won't take eggs for payments, so while the budget is short due to low sales/crop losses, monthly bills still need to be paid, too.  I keep the budget pretty tight, but I do occasionally need to hit the grocery store myself. And the truck won't run on air, either. <br/></p><p>So you see, there's always expenses. And the CSA budget is the backbone, no doubt. We're at capacity for what I feel comfortable trying to provide for, and some of those are not paying, but work/trade shares. I am always open to sliding scale arrangements for a family who wants to eat healthier. <br/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1432521561/iemv1i7wg1itcgzrwsex.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 324.836px; height: 208px;""/></p>As other means to raise capital, I also offer farm tours and I'm adding one as a perk this go round.

<p>HELP US HELP S/E DALLAS COUNTY ACCESS MORE <i>REAL, FRESH </i>FOOD<i> GROWN
WITH </i>INTEGRITY<i>!</i></p>
<p>Good, <i>real</i>, food, and <i>fair access</i> to it, is what can bring
people together for the cause of helping feed a community something healthier
than the fast ""food"" joints that are popping up all over the
landscape. Often, covering over land that could have become another community
garden area where fresh food was grown and distributed. </p>
<p>Add to that the small farm aspect of this country’s history, and its
importance to a community - and the two ideas go hand in hand. </p>
<p>Take a small, indie farmer working hard to educate her community and make
healthy food available and affordable for those who wouldn’t otherwise have
access to it; <i>that's</i> what this fund raiser is all about. </p>
<p>I am a small, independent farmer living on 14 acres in
Southeast Dallas County, in North Texas where I own and operate a sustainable,
organic, permaculture minded farm. I grow seasonal produce for a small but
loyal CSA membership and a twice a month farmer's market held right here on the
farm, in the small city I live in, which lacks access to fresh, local, organic
produce. I teach classes on food preparation, gardening and have interned
several young people interested in farming. </p>
<p>In order to really be efficient, financially sustainable and grow more food
for the on-farm community farmer's market, I really need a front end loader on
my tractor. </p>
<p>This way I can make more in-house compost, which keeps the soil healthier
and grows more food, and works better, plus saves money over buying bagged
organic fertilizers, thereby keeping food costs lower for my neighborhood, and
reducing the farm’s over all footprint. </p>
<p>A front end loader is not cheap, and I haven't been able to save up enough
with the amount of crops I'm currently yielding. Even using organic
fertilizers, the soil needs things like microbes to help break down the
fertilizer. Without being able to add lots of living compost, where microbes
live, the process of decomposition is painstakingly slow - and the yields are
low. The soil out here is kind of like beach sand. It takes a lot of compost to
make it healthy. </p>
<p>Besides that, just keeping the farm running month to month, with a super
tight cash flow, is a challenge. Farmers are sort of like teachers and
firefighters - we're not in it for the glory or the riches. ;)  </p>
<p>But, a loader installed on the existing tractor IS an excellent and wise
investment. For the long term future of the farm, it means several steps in the
right direction towards sustainability in so many ways for the farm, and the
community it serves. </p>
<p>Therefore, I'm reaching out to people like you, far and wide through this
Indiegogo crowd funding campaign, in hopes of raising enough capital to get <b>a
front end loader</b> attached to my tractor.....it costs about four grand, plus
the cost of perks, this site's campaign fees, etc. </p>
<p>Any farmer needs the right equipment, in order to be
proficient. From tools for the soil to help ensure a bountiful harvest, to the
storage equipment to keep the food they toiled to grow, fresh for the people
who are going to eat it. </p>
<p>So I’m also trying to raise enough
to help fund <b>a walk-in cooler and ice maker</b> to keep that food fresh. 
That's about another 3k, plus perks, fees, etc.,  <i>(Garden Café is watching an ice
maker for us on an auction right now!)</i></p>
<p>And since we're always taught to ""dream big"", let's shoot for <b>a
16’ utility trailer</b>, too, once we make our current 10k goal! <i>(Calais Winery has a beautiful trailer
waiting on us – all legally titled and ready to roll!)</i> </p>
<p>The trailer would be awesome, and a gift that keeps on giving, because then
I can haul the tractor to help other farmers and community gardeners with a
piece of equipment many don't have. The walk-in and ice machine are things
other local farmers who vend here at our farmer’s market can benefit from as
well. </p><p><b>That's the <i>short</i> of it. </b><br/></p><p> I hope you will contribute to this campaign by choosing a perk/level on the right, and help us reach our goal - even exceed it - so we can also get the new trailer, too.</p><p> There are fun and cool perks for contributing, if you want them, or you can just savor the warm and fuzzy feeling you get when you step up and help someone do something important and wonderful - like bring awesome, nutritious, fresh produce to a food desert community by helping a small farmer do her job more effectively and efficiently. <br/></p><p><b>Thank You,</b> for checking out this project and sharing it around with others.  And remember, if we reach the full <b>$10k goal</b>, we save 5% in fees! I know I'll post some updates as this goes on, so be sure to check back and see how we're doing! We have 47 days, until midnight November 8th, to reach our goal.<br/></p><p></p><p>When it was first suggested that I use a crowd-funding
campaign to raise money for the farm, I was skeptical. Would total
strangers want to give money to a farm they've never seen, don't know the
mission of, and may never see? <br/></p><p>But then I thought about how this farm started -
through Community Supported Agriculture - which is a kind of small crowd
funding model, too. <a href=""http://www.edensorganicgardencenter.com/faqs.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CSA's</a>
help stabilize a small farm's base budget, plus help give the community food security, and it's how I was able to break ground
on this farm back in 2008.</p>Please share this project with whoever and where ever 
you think folks might be interested in helping Eden's Garden CSA Farm - 
GROW! <br/><br/><br/><p><b>UPDATE 10/22</b></p><p>We're nearly half way to our goal - with only 2 weeks left. It's time for the final push!! There's a great little ice maker waiting for us if we can just get there. A trailer, all legally titled and everything, awaits us in the wine country thanks to Calais Winery ready to sel us their 18' trailer.

</h3><h3>Who Are ""We""and What Do We Need?</h3>
<p>Eden’s Garden CSA Farm was founded in
2008 by me, Marie Tedei, with the goal of making a fair living and providing real
food grown with integrity for the community in Southeast Dallas
 County where I had lived
for nearly 20 years. </p><p>
</p><p>There
are several low income housing apartment complexes and neighborhoods within a few
miles of the farm’s front gate and only 1 grocery store that does not provide
local or organic produce. </p><p>
</p><p>Those
living south of the farm have even less access to good food, as there are nothing
but gas stations and stores primarily selling beer, wine and liquor within
several miles. (This is basically the definition of a <a href=""https://apps.ams.usda.gov/fooddeserts/foodDeserts.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">USDA food desert</a>.)  <br/></p><p>
</p><p><b>You get the idea. We needed an oasis. </b><br/></p><p>To
help provide that oasis for the community, my new farming career
started with a little monthly “market day”. Locals without transportation could
walk, literally, to a farmer’s market at my little organic garden center, and purchase fresh food and meet the
actual farmers and ranchers. <br/></p><p>
</p><p>I wasn't growing food - yet - but it
provided the few small, local farmers I knew, the opportunity to sell without
the pricing pressures of cheap, imported foods and the wholesale food brokers
they were used to at the old big city “farmer’s market” downtown. <br/></p><p><a href=""http://www.edensorganicgardencenter.com/market%20day.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Eden’s Market Day</a> was one of the
first, “neighborhood” markets, and is still the <i>only
</i>all farmers, all ""organic"" food farmers market in DFW. </p><h3>But, If You Want Something Done....</h3><p>However, it became pretty
clear, pretty fast, that if this market was going to be successful, and I was
determined to make that happen, it meant I was going to have to use my
horticultural background, change my focus and start growing produce here
myself. No more landscape design. It was time to really roll up my sleeves.<br/></p>
<p>The need in my community for access to fresh, local produce - grown without
toxic, synthetic chemicals - tugged at both my heartstrings, my entrepreneurial
and eco- friendly, tree hugging spirit.</p><br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/867328/files/20140918184117-showing_off_snowball.JPG?1411090877"" src="""" style=""width: 265.936px; height: 355px;""/></p>Some still think I'm probably a little bit crazy to have
quit a ""real"" job to make a living by farming. But this is the most
consuming, disappointing, educational, interesting, monotonous, satisfying,
uplifting and worthwhile ""job"" I've ever had. And I can't think of
another job I'd rather have, instead.<br/><br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/867461/files/20140918201127-DSCF0055.JPG?1411096287"" src="""" style=""width: 233.333px; height: 175px;""/></p><p>(above is one of my first mentors - co-owner of <a href=""http://www.homesweetfarm.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">HOMEsweetFARM</a> serving Houston)<br/></p>I'd already been hearing it
loud and clear from other small farmers in <a href=""http://www.tofga.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TOFGA</a> who couldn't understand why I
wasn't already growing food, instead of boarding horses and designing xeric
landscapes for a living.  <br/><br/>
They all echoed the same thing - there just weren't <i>enough</i> small, local growers
using organic methods in the state - or in the Dallas
area. <br/><br/>
And they were right, the demand <i>was</i> great - new customers were coming to the market every
week looking for organically grown produce for their families. Some came via
doctor’s orders, some for the fresher taste, and others just to support local,
food. <br/><br/><i>So what's a girl to do?  In the fall of 2008; I broke ground and…</i><br/><br/><h3>A Farm Was Born!</h3>
<p>Most
of the start-up capital for the modest budget came from my full time job income
and people in the surrounding Dallas area that were anxious to have a small
farm nearby from which they could purchase produce and bring their families to
visit. </p><p>
</p><blockquote><p>This
way of supporting a farm is a model called <a href=""http://www.edensorganicgardencenter.com/CSA.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.edensorganicgardencenter.com/market%20day.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">CSA, or Community Supported Agriculture</a>. Families pledge a portion of the budget for the farm’s needs,
(labor, seeds, plant starts, supplies, and soil amendments, equipment, etc.) in
exchange for a “share” of the harvest once it starts rolling in later in the year.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately, that winter I
managed to acquire a reliable, fairly new, small John Deere 650 tractor with a
mower attachment (or brush hog – or bush hog depending on what part of the
world you’re from). And a few small implements that help a lot
with soil work were also acquired that summer and later in 2012.<br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/867359/files/20140918185748-2009_0425Assortedevents0020.JPG?1411091868"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3><b>We Are Off to a Great Start!</b></h3>
<p>Now
in our 6<sup>th</sup> year, I still hold a market on the farm twice a month. And along with a handful of other small
farmers and ranchers, and a local, artisan sourdough baker, I still enjoy the <i>valid
and well earned</i> reputation this market has for only selling “clean” or
organically produced food, that is also produced locally, and sold at realistic prices the community can afford. </p><p>
</p><p>The
USDA approved our market to accept SNAP funds from customers who use federal
“food stamp” benefits. This, along with sliding scale pricing for the CSA, truly
makes our food accessible to anyone who strives to access fresh, local, organic
food. </p><p>
</p><h3></h3><h3>
<i>However</i>
</h3><p>Overall the market still runs short in produce to supply the demand. I need to grow more produce to sell here to feed the community at large, and at other markets to help the farm be more financially
sustainable and fund our other programs. </p><p>
</p><p>This
community farm consists of 1 full time grower, yep, that would be me. It’s a
1-woman farm you could say. And I can only do so much with a shovel and a wheel barrow.....<br/></p><h3>What We Need <br/>
</h3>
<p>We need to make compost – and lots of it!! 

</p><p>The
demand for a <b>front end loader</b> on a farm is <i>great</i>.
Ask any farmer. The demand for one on a farm with only 1 full time grower and a
handful of occasional volunteers is even greater. </p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p></p><p>A new
after-market front end loader can be attached to our existing tractor. But they’re not
cheap. </p>
<h3><b>This is where <i>you</i> come in!</b></h3>
<p>I'm reaching out to people far and wide through this Indiegogo crowd funding
campaign, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the deal,  a brand new after-market loader <i>can</i>
be attached to our existing tractor. (I've done the homework, it's too risky to find a used loader that ""might"" fit our tractor.) So I found a dealer to order it, a tractor mechanic to install it and they said they'll even paint it John Deere Green!<br/></p><blockquote><p>(I asked for pink, but, whatever....) <br/></p></blockquote><p></p><p>
<b>A loader here on the farm full time means much more compost can be made to feed the soil and a lot more veggies grown to feed the community. <br/></b></p><p>(Not to mention all of the other heavy projects generally unattainable by 1 person.)<br/></p>

If we raise all the funds to
buy and install a new front end loader for our tractor, (which is about 4k
installed, plus the fees we have to pay for running this campaign and cost of
perks, etc.), any additional funds will go towards funding our <b>solar powered
walk-in cooler</b>, <i>(because we're going to be growing a lot more veggies and
will need a place to store them as we harvest the bounty!) </i><br/><br/>
We're planning to build it ourselves using as much recycled material as
feasible. <br/><br/><i>If we're still ahead of the game</i> on this campaign with time and willing
contributors left, I will purchase <b>an ice maker</b> to keep the veggies cold in the ice chests at market and on deliveries.  All of this, plus perks and fees, comes to about 10k<br/><br/><b>Still feeling generous?</b> ""They"" tell you to have a ""stretch"" goal; <i>so</i> here's ours;<br/><br/>I learned the hard way that <b>a trailer</b> with a
legal title is not as easy to come by as I hoped, nor as inexpensive as I thought. So, we'll
add your funds to some we were given earlier this summer to find one, and finally buy <b>a legally titled 16'-18' utility trailer</b> that I can haul the
tractor on, (with it's shiny new loader you helped us get, and my other tractor implements), to help community
gardens and other farmers who don't have this invaluable equipment. It's the
gift that keeps on giving! <br/><p></p><h3>
<b>What Else Can You Do? - Glad You Asked!</b><br/>
</h3>We can always use funds to;

<ul>
<li>upgrade our solar powered
     irrigation system </li>
<li>finish building the solar
     power system and build a solar powered hot water heater for our off-grid
     <b>yurt classroom/eco-friendly homestead exhibit</b>;</li>
<li>build and integrate a bigger
     rain catchment system to provide more rainwater for our livestock and
     interactive educational permaculture herb and veggie garden</li>
<li>replace frost cloth,
     greenhouse plastic, irrigation tapes and other supplies....</li>
</ul><p> ...............the <a href=""http://www.edensorganicgardencenter.com/wish%20list.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">""wish list""</a> could go on
and on. (And it does!)<br/><br/>
Trust me, <i>all </i>of the funds raised, will be <i>well</i> used for the farm's
needs!  There are critters to feed, fences to fix; a 100 year old property rarely runs out of projects. :)<br/></p><p><i>PLUS - if you help me reach the <b>full goal of $10,000,</b> fees go down

I can't thank you all enough. Here we are past the spring when Inidigogo launched their InDemand program and all of the rains - and we're into another drought - if you can believe that! Not any rain to speak of since June 30th - as I type this, it's October 11th. We lost a lot of ground to those floods, and fall is late to get planted due to the opposite problem now - no rain. I'm hanging in here - doing my best to make lemon meringue pie from the lemony weather. The pond is dry - and YES! I used the new loader to scoop up as much of the silt
 as I could. I ended up having to hire a 4wd tractor operator to really 
dig in and give it more depth. The pond is now 3' deeper in some areas. 
I hate thieves
Last month, someone helped themselves to some of the equipment that is pertinent to the farm. The AC/DC inverter that allows me to pump water using the solar panels - those were nailed down, so they didn't steal them.  That's about $100My beloved oiless air generator - with all of the tires around here - you have to have one of those! $60So many of my hand tools - you know, hammers, screw drivers, channel locks, and all of the goodies that you accumulate in your handy dandy tool box - gone-ski! Some used tools have been donated to me from a few folks - thank you! But I'm still grabbing for that extra hack saw, big ol' pair of channel locks, and odds and ends nails, screws, nuts and bolts. Let's say - about $100 worth of stuff.Another biggie they got was my old wood handled pick axe. I'm sure it was a vintage model, but it came in handy for breaking up hard ground. (I'm hoping the thief isn't going to use it to break in doors...) $50 - at least55-gallon plastic barrels are not free. They used one of mine to cart a bunch of stuff off in! Yep! $70My nerves have been a bit edgy and I'd sleep a bit better if I could have a decent security camera system installed. You know, the kind that films, AND calls you so you can call the cops ASAP.... or, go greet them with your shot gun. I've priced some and we're looking at at least $500+ for the solar powered; which I need since there's not any AC power past the pond - AND I like to be green.Add a few solar powered pole spot lights - $45 eaAnd if you can believe it, they even stole the dogs' stainless steel feed bowls! Those were not cheap! $15eachMy official Red Rider carbine-action 200-shot range model BB rifle with a compass in the stock was also among the items swiped. Now I have a replacement from a friend - but I think it's time for a .410 pump action shot gun, don't you? $500All in all, I'm lucky - they let me sleep. They didn't hurt the animals. Everything that was taken is more or less replaceable. Insurance doesn't hit till they get $2k in stuff. Insurance is in case the place burns to the ground - not for thieving punks. But add to this all of the lost crops from the spring floods - also not insurable on a small farm - and the slow summer sales and slow start to fall. Well, a boost of cash flow would be great. I'd still like to;
 Re-do the front yard into a free community garden. (See below under Last Fall) 

Put a solar system w/security cameras into the yurt for classes that require power/video, etc. and to keep it all safe. 

And I really need to hire someone to fix the barns, level the house and replace some rotting wood; upgrade the electrical all around this 100 yr old homestead and I've got a few roofs that need some real fixing that I am not going to be able to do this time. I've done repairs, but I think it's time for new. Let's estimate that at $1,000 

As always - anything you can muster up is appreciated. I've helped others over the summer with my tractor, pitched in my $25 - $200 for those in need where and when I could, and that's all because of your past generosity! We're all in this local food stuff together! Thanks! Last Fall;Last fall, 74 or so very generous people helped the farm acquire a front end loader, ice maker, trailer and the budget for a walk-in cooler. The fine folks at Indiegogo unveiled a new idea recently, that allows you to continue to partner with the farm, even though the main fundraiser is over. It's called InDemand. A small, one person run farm like this one, is always in need of something - and it's usually something that wasn't in the budget.  Like;
a skilled repairman, 

a part to fix something that shouldn't have broken, 

fencing to keep out new neighbors' new flock of goats so they don't eat my garden, irrigation supplies to expand the edible forest, or 

other stuff that just plain wears out or breaks. 

And right now with all of this rain, I'm worried about the foundation of both of the decades old barns and their leaky roofs! That's not going to be cheap to get fixed, and I'm not brave enough to jack up a 60+ year old barn by myself. LOL And lately, with the record flooding rains, many crops have been lost, which means, sales are lost, and the budget could really use a shot in the arm. Some projects I am working on include a Balch Springs, TX branch of the Food is Free Project community garden.  Basically, through volunteers and in any extra time I have, a garden is planted out in the front yard for members of the community, I'm thinking mostly it will be passersby, to eat from. So far, there are several fruit trees, a product of the last fund raiser's perk program, and the frame of a raised bed that will allow those with disabilities to access it. Here is a pic of the new loader being used to fill the bed with logs for hugelkultur.So there's some expenses associated with that like plants, seeds, more edible perennials, some more wood for additional raised beds, (one of our volunteers found this wood!), and a little budget to be able to offer snacks, water, and lunch to our volunteers would be awesome, too. Also, in order to give our customers at the farmer's market held here a better selection of products, I'm working on the plans to put in a pallet-based covered porch on which a small chest freezer can sit for self-serve grass fed beef and pastured chicken purchases. So many small farmers are too busy to work more than 1 market, and I know this one isn't as busy as some, but our community needs good food, too.  Using pallets that I have access to through a vendor, will keep the costs down. But it would be nice to be able to compensate the handyman for his trips back and forth to help build it. Gas isn't free and he's on a fixed income. And so far, the utility, mortgage and insurance company won't take eggs for payments, so while the budget is short due to low sales/crop losses, monthly bills still need to be paid, too.  I keep the budget pretty tight, but I do occasionally need to hit the grocery store myself. And the truck won't run on air, either. So you see, there's always expenses. And the CSA budget is the backbone, no doubt. We're at capacity for what I feel comfortable trying to provide for, and some of those are not paying, but work/trade shares. I am always open to sliding scale arrangements for a family who wants to eat healthier. As other means to raise capital, I also offer farm tours and I'm adding one as a perk this go round. I actually love it when classes come out to the farm and learn about where food comes from, get to pet a chicken and see a piece of native Texas prairie - nearly in their own backyards. And, just this spring, we started yoga class in the recently acquired yurt, which also needs to be paid for. The young couple who started their off-grid living experiment in it here, rather than take it down and relocate it, decided to allow me to keep it, for a whale of a deal, when they left. But I do still need to pay them, re-install a solar and security camera package and restore a donated wood-burning/propane kitchen stove so we can also rent it out for private dinners, cooking and other classes. The storage shed was broken into and the doors need to be replaced so tables and chairs can be kept back there for these kinds of events. I'll be back and post updates here periodically. But the best way to keep up with Life on the Farm - is here, at the blog. Or here, on Facebook. Anything you send is very much appreciated and needed. Small farming isn't the most lucrative business in the world, but it is the most satisfying job I've ever had. Please help me keep the farm going so we can keep, feeding the soil - feeding the community. Thank you very much.Farmer Marie The Long and the Short of It

For in-depth details of the campaign and farm's history, or the Long of It, scroll down a bit to the next video.
 For the edited, quick and simple version, or the Short of It - here's the scoop;  with current updates. It will give you the basics.
10/04 - THERE IS A CURRENT CHALLENGE ON THE CAMPAIGN - A GENEROUS SUPPORTER HAS OFFERED TO MATCH ANY AND ALL CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO $5,000!! YOUR SUPPORT IS DOUBLED - JUST LIKE THAT! 10/25 - Check out the new perks! Dylan & Company candles. Dude Sweet Chocolate. PLUS another private dinner at the farm with Chef Graham Dodds of Hibiscus! $2 gets you in to our salute to Veterans and Farmers mini-film festival Nov. 7th.11/1 - We did it! The original goal of 10k has been met! We do still have perks up and if you would like to be part of this campaign, know that any additional funds that come in between now and the end of the campaign, will surely be used towards other farm needs. Things like solar panels, etc. for the yurt, ($1500 est), new rolls of frost cloth (yes, it gets cold in N. Texas), new seat for the tractor (the horses chewed on the old one), upgraded solar charger for new flock of chickens....with a farm, extra money always gets put to good use! HERE'S THE START
HELP US HELP S/E DALLAS COUNTY ACCESS MORE REAL, FRESH FOOD GROWN
WITH INTEGRITY!
Good, real, food, and fair access to it, is what can bring
people together for the cause of helping feed a community something healthier
than the fast ""food"" joints that are popping up all over the
landscape. Often, covering over land that could have become another community
garden area where fresh food was grown and distributed. 
Add to that the small farm aspect of this country’s history, and its
importance to a community - and the two ideas go hand in hand. 
Take a small, indie farmer working hard to educate her community and make
healthy food available and affordable for those who wouldn’t otherwise have
access to it; that's what this fund raiser is all about. 
I am a small, independent farmer living on 14 acres in
Southeast Dallas County, in North Texas where I own and operate a sustainable,
organic, permaculture minded farm. I grow seasonal produce for a small but
loyal CSA membership and a twice a month farmer's market held right here on the
farm, in the small city I live in, which lacks access to fresh, local, organic
produce. I teach classes on food preparation, gardening and have interned
several young people interested in farming. 
In order to really be efficient, financially sustainable and grow more food
for the on-farm community farmer's market, I really need a front end loader on
my tractor. 
This way I can make more in-house compost, which keeps the soil healthier
and grows more food, and works better, plus saves money over buying bagged
organic fertilizers, thereby keeping food costs lower for my neighborhood, and
reducing the farm’s over all footprint. 
A front end loader is not cheap, and I haven't been able to save up enough
with the amount of crops I'm currently yielding. Even using organic
fertilizers, the soil needs things like microbes to help break down the
fertilizer. Without being able to add lots of living compost, where microbes
live, the process of decomposition is painstakingly slow - and the yields are
low. The soil out here is kind of like beach sand. It takes a lot of compost to
make it healthy. 
Besides that, just keeping the farm running month to month, with a super
tight cash flow, is a challenge. Farmers are sort of like teachers and
firefighters - we're not in it for the glory or the riches. ;)  
But, a loader installed on the existing tractor IS an excellent and wise
investment. For the long term future of the farm, it means several steps in the
right direction towards sustainability in so many ways for the farm, and the
community it serves. 
Therefore, I'm reaching out to people like you, far and wide through this
Indiegogo crowd funding campaign, in hopes of raising enough capital to get a
front end loader attached to my tractor.....it costs about four grand, plus
the cost of perks, this site's campaign fees, etc. 
Any farmer needs the right equipment, in order to be
proficient. From tools for the soil to help ensure a bountiful harvest, to the
storage equipment to keep the food they toiled to grow, fresh for the people
who are going to eat it. 
So I’m also trying to raise enough
to help fund a walk-in cooler and ice maker to keep that food fresh. 
That's about another 3k, plus perks, fees, etc.,  (Garden Café is watching an ice
maker for us on an auction right now!)
And since we're always taught to ""dream big"", let's shoot for a
16’ utility trailer, too, once we make our current 10k goal! (Calais Winery has a beautiful trailer
waiting on us – all legally titled and ready to roll!) 
The trailer would be awesome, and a gift that keeps on giving, because then
I can haul the tractor to help other farmers and community gardeners with a
piece of equipment many don't have. The walk-in and ice machine are things
other local farmers who vend here at our farmer’s market can benefit from as
well. That's the short of it.  I hope you will contribute to this campaign by choosing a perk/level on the right, and help us reach our goal - even exceed it - so we can also get the new trailer, too. There are fun and cool perks for contributing, if you want them, or you can just savor the warm and fuzzy feeling you get when you step up and help someone do something important and wonderful - like bring awesome, nutritious, fresh produce to a food desert community by helping a small farmer do her job more effectively and efficiently. Thank You, for checking out this project and sharing it around with others.  And remember, if we reach the full $10k goal, we save 5% in fees! I know I'll post some updates as this goes on, so be sure to check back and see how we're doing! We have 47 days, until midnight November 8th, to reach our goal.When it was first suggested that I use a crowd-funding
campaign to raise money for the farm, I was skeptical. Would total
strangers want to give money to a farm they've never seen, don't know the
mission of, and may never see? But then I thought about how this farm started -
through Community Supported Agriculture - which is a kind of small crowd
funding model, too. CSA's
help stabilize a small farm's base budget, plus help give the community food security, and it's how I was able to break ground
on this farm back in 2008.Please share this project with whoever and where ever 
you think folks might be interested in helping Eden's Garden CSA Farm - 
GROW! UPDATE 10/22We're nearly half way to our goal - with only 2 weeks left. It's time for the final push!! There's a great little ice maker waiting for us if we can just get there. A trailer, all legally titled and everything, awaits us in the wine country thanks to Calais Winery ready to sel us their 18' trailer. And the plans for the walk-in cooler are being reviewed right now - we've started to clear the area where it will be built. Won't you please help us feed the community better, more efficiently, and sustainably? Thank you. UPDATE 10/10 -  So here's where we are on our Non-GMO, Heirloom Corn Goal Cob....Because
 of our generous matching challenger, we will get our loader and we're 
nearly at our 2nd goal! Our community garden friends are very excited at
 the help this will mean for them, too! But, more harvest also means, we'll need a way to store the bounty of veggies as soon as they're harvested until they can be available for the community market. Every neighborhood deserves super fresh food - not 2nd grade quality. So please help us reach our next goal to raise $2500 for the materials to build a (mostly) off grid walk-in cooler. 
 The plans are being reviewed right now - in exchange for a dozen 
pastured eggs from the farm's hard working hens. Thank you to Greg &
 Gianna! PLUS - Our challenger says the matching challenge is still on - up until we raise $5,000! We still have $1476 available in matching funds! Make your contribution count double!You are helping build an accessible, safe, food ""hub"" for the folks in this food desert. An oasis!  10/08
 - We Did It! YOU Did IT! We have made it to our first benchmark goal 
(with the matching funds added in)!! The loader means this farm can 
scoop manure and mulch, make it into BIG piles of compost and spread it 
out - MUCH more efficiently!! Here's a pic of what it will look like 
here soon! I'm
 so excited and humbled at the same time that so many of you rallied 
around this project, Feed the Soil - Feed the Community! Our next
 goal is $2500 for the walk in cooler materials. We'll certainly be 
producing more and more as the soil gets better and better and we're 
already currently running out of ice chests to keep the produce fresh as
 we harvest it. We have a spot all picked out for it, I've 
been working on the plans and can't wait to have a ""green"" walk-in 
cooler that not only will keep food fresh, but use solar power and 
re-generate rain water to irrigate our seedlings in the greenhouse! 
We've got a month left in this campaign - let's do this!! (Plus, if we 
reach our full goal of 10k, we save 5% on the fees this platform 
charges.) 10/07 - We're almost at our first benchmark of 
$4000! Thank you - with a loader, we'll be on our way to making more 
compost for this farm's super sandy soil. (ever try to grow veggies in 
beach sand?) I'm delighted at the support and shared some of your 
comments in the latest update. Be sure to ""follow"" the campaign to get 
updates and details on our campaign count down party! 10/04 - THERE IS A CURRENT CHALLENGE ON THE CAMPAIGN - A GENEROUS SUPPORTER HAS OFFERED TO MATCH ANY AND ALL CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO $5,000!! YOUR SUPPORT IS DOUBLED - JUST LIKE THAT! The Long of It;Now, if you really want to get a feel for who I am, what I'm trying to do here in Southeast Dallas County, Texas, what this farm is all about and how you can be a part of it - please, sit back and enjoy our short, but a little longer than the above, video, and/or read on... my sweet friend Margaret did an awesome job for us on this video, and I want to show you what we're all about here at Eden's.... 

Who Are ""We""and What Do We Need?
Eden’s Garden CSA Farm was founded in
2008 by me, Marie Tedei, with the goal of making a fair living and providing real
food grown with integrity for the community in Southeast Dallas
 County where I had lived
for nearly 20 years. 
There
are several low income housing apartment complexes and neighborhoods within a few
miles of the farm’s front gate and only 1 grocery store that does not provide
local or organic produce. 
Those
living south of the farm have even less access to good food, as there are nothing
but gas stations and stores primarily selling beer, wine and liquor within
several miles. (This is basically the definition of a USDA food desert.)  
You get the idea. We needed an oasis. To
help provide that oasis for the community, my new farming career
started with a little monthly “market day”. Locals without transportation could
walk, literally, to a farmer’s market at my little organic garden center, and purchase fresh food and meet the
actual farmers and ranchers. 
I wasn't growing food - yet - but it
provided the few small, local farmers I knew, the opportunity to sell without
the pricing pressures of cheap, imported foods and the wholesale food brokers
they were used to at the old big city “farmer’s market” downtown. Eden’s Market Day was one of the
first, “neighborhood” markets, and is still the only
all farmers, all ""organic"" food farmers market in DFW. But, If You Want Something Done....However, it became pretty
clear, pretty fast, that if this market was going to be successful, and I was
determined to make that happen, it meant I was going to have to use my
horticultural background, change my focus and start growing produce here
myself. No more landscape design. It was time to really roll up my sleeves.
The need in my community for access to fresh, local produce - grown without
toxic, synthetic chemicals - tugged at both my heartstrings, my entrepreneurial
and eco- friendly, tree hugging spirit.Some still think I'm probably a little bit crazy to have
quit a ""real"" job to make a living by farming. But this is the most
consuming, disappointing, educational, interesting, monotonous, satisfying,
uplifting and worthwhile ""job"" I've ever had. And I can't think of
another job I'd rather have, instead.(above is one of my first mentors - co-owner of HOMEsweetFARM serving Houston)I'd already been hearing it
loud and clear from other small farmers in TOFGA who couldn't understand why I
wasn't already growing food, instead of boarding horses and designing xeric
landscapes for a living.  
They all echoed the same thing - there just weren't enough small, local growers
using organic methods in the state - or in the Dallas
area. 
And they were right, the demand was great - new customers were coming to the market every
week looking for organically grown produce for their families. Some came via
doctor’s orders, some for the fresher taste, and others just to support local,
food. So what's a girl to do?  In the fall of 2008; I broke ground and…A Farm Was Born!
Most
of the start-up capital for the modest budget came from my full time job income
and people in the surrounding Dallas area that were anxious to have a small
farm nearby from which they could purchase produce and bring their families to
visit. 
This
way of supporting a farm is a model called CSA, or Community Supported Agriculture. Families pledge a portion of the budget for the farm’s needs,
(labor, seeds, plant starts, supplies, and soil amendments, equipment, etc.) in
exchange for a “share” of the harvest once it starts rolling in later in the year.


Fortunately, that winter I
managed to acquire a reliable, fairly new, small John Deere 650 tractor with a
mower attachment (or brush hog – or bush hog depending on what part of the
world you’re from). And a few small implements that help a lot
with soil work were also acquired that summer and later in 2012.We Are Off to a Great Start!
Now
in our 6th year, I still hold a market on the farm twice a month. And along with a handful of other small
farmers and ranchers, and a local, artisan sourdough baker, I still enjoy the valid
and well earned reputation this market has for only selling “clean” or
organically produced food, that is also produced locally, and sold at realistic prices the community can afford. 
The
USDA approved our market to accept SNAP funds from customers who use federal
“food stamp” benefits. This, along with sliding scale pricing for the CSA, truly
makes our food accessible to anyone who strives to access fresh, local, organic
food. 

However
Overall the market still runs short in produce to supply the demand. I need to grow more produce to sell here to feed the community at large, and at other markets to help the farm be more financially
sustainable and fund our other programs. 
This
community farm consists of 1 full time grower, yep, that would be me. It’s a
1-woman farm you could say. And I can only do so much with a shovel and a wheel barrow.....What We Need 

We need to make compost – and lots of it!! 

The
demand for a front end loader on a farm is great.
Ask any farmer. The demand for one on a farm with only 1 full time grower and a
handful of occasional volunteers is even greater. 

A new
after-market front end loader can be attached to our existing tractor. But they’re not
cheap. 
This is where you come in!
I'm reaching out to people far and wide through this Indiegogo crowd funding
campaign, 

Here's the deal,  a brand new after-market loader can
be attached to our existing tractor. (I've done the homework, it's too risky to find a used loader that ""might"" fit our tractor.) So I found a dealer to order it, a tractor mechanic to install it and they said they'll even paint it John Deere Green!(I asked for pink, but, whatever....) 
A loader here on the farm full time means much more compost can be made to feed the soil and a lot more veggies grown to feed the community. (Not to mention all of the other heavy projects generally unattainable by 1 person.)

If we raise all the funds to
buy and install a new front end loader for our tractor, (which is about 4k
installed, plus the fees we have to pay for running this campaign and cost of
perks, etc.), any additional funds will go towards funding our solar powered
walk-in cooler, (because we're going to be growing a lot more veggies and
will need a place to store them as we harvest the bounty!) 
We're planning to build it ourselves using as much recycled material as
feasible. If we're still ahead of the game on this campaign with time and willing
contributors left, I will purchase an ice maker to keep the veggies cold in the ice chests at market and on deliveries.  All of this, plus perks and fees, comes to about 10kStill feeling generous? ""They"" tell you to have a ""stretch"" goal; so here's ours;I learned the hard way that a trailer with a
legal title is not as easy to come by as I hoped, nor as inexpensive as I thought. So, we'll
add your funds to some we were given earlier this summer to find one, and finally buy a legally titled 16'-18' utility trailer that I can haul the
tractor on, (with it's shiny new loader you helped us get, and my other tractor implements), to help community
gardens and other farmers who don't have this invaluable equipment. It's the
gift that keeps on giving! 
What Else Can You Do? - Glad You Asked!
We can always use funds to;


upgrade our solar powered
     irrigation system 
finish building the solar
     power system and build a solar powered hot water heater for our off-grid
     yurt classroom/eco-friendly homestead exhibit;
build and integrate a bigger
     rain catchment system to provide more rainwater for our livestock and
     interactive educational permaculture herb and veggie garden
replace frost cloth,
     greenhouse plastic, irrigation tapes and other supplies....
 ...............the ""wish list"" could go on
and on. (And it does!)
Trust me, all of the funds raised, will be well used for the farm's
needs!  There are critters to feed, fences to fix; a 100 year old property rarely runs out of projects. :)PLUS - if you help me reach the full goal of $10,000, fees go down
to 4%!  So we'll be able to keep and put to use more of the cash you
contribute.My main vision for this farm has always been to empower people to eat well,
teach people to grow some of their own food, get them excited about farming and to make myself an honorable living. And, to do
it all with transparency, integrity and sustainability so this community is proud of its farm and is around for many
generations to come. With your generous help, you can be a part of that vision, and help me make it
happen! Thanks for taking a look at what we're doing here - and considering
making a contribution to;  FEED THE SOIL, FEED THE COMMUNITY!PERKS, PERKS, and MORE PERKS!Thanks for checking out this project. Please choose from one of the fun perks to help thank you for pitching in to help raise money for the farm!

</p><p>Aquamassage harnesses the power of water to help people enter a perfect
state of mind and body, for a feeling of well-being and renewal.  Our
sophisticated dry water massage technology lets you easily select the
preprogrammed massage service to suit your unique requirements, such as
stronger pressure on the lower back and gentle pressure in the neck
region.  For clients who desire more individual control over their
experience, a handheld control enables the client to pause the massage jets on
a desired location, increase or decrease the pressure in any zone, and select
any single or double direction effects of massage for optimum pain relief
and/or relaxation.</p>
<p>Virtually anyone can feel a need for massage.  Numerous research
studies have documented that massage has an impressive range of physical,
mental and emotional benefits.  Massage has long been recognized as a
valuable method of physical and psychological healing and rejuvenation offering
user preventative and curative treatment.</p>
<p>Our massage system technology divides the body into 12 equal zones, ranging
from the feet to the neck. Pressure and pulsation frequency of the massage jets
can be independently and easily programmed for each zone. Entering the height
of clients automatically adjusts the length of the 12 zones to match body
proportions.</p>
<p>Using the automatic “Gentle Start” option gradually increases the water
pressure and/or pulsating frequency for a smooth introduction to your massage.
The “Gentle Finish” setting automatically decreases the pulsating frequency for
a relaxing ending.</p>

<p><b><u>ABOUT JOANNE SAMMS - The Team Captain
and President of Refresh Aquamassage</u></b></p>
<p>My vision for Refresh Aquamassage started 4 years ago after a visit to the
Cloud 9 Aquamassage in the West Edmonton Mall. 
Tired from walking around the humongous mall, I spied the Aquamassage
machines and wanted to give them a try. I came out of that machine feeling
refreshed and rejuvenated and knowing that I had to find a place to have this
experience back in Brampton.  I was
disappointed that there were no Aquamassage machines around the Brampton area
and vowed at that time to  bring them to
Brampton not just for me, but for everyone else here that I know will benefit
once Refresh Aquamassage is ready! Well, the time has come! I have taken a huge
leap forward in this venture with the purchase of the first Aquamassage
machine. As I work toward the 2<sup>nd</sup> machine for opening day, I
envision the smiles on people’s faces when they come out of the Aquamassage
machine with less stress, less pain and an overall sense of well being. </p>
<p>With more than ten years experience as a Facility Manager for some large
organizations, as well as a business owner and business consultant, I have the skills
and qualifications necessary to see this project through to opening day and to
run a successful business going forward. I look forward to serving the
community with the benefits of Refresh Aquamassage for many years to come.</p>
<p>I hope that after looking through the campaign, you share the vision and that you will donate
to our start up.  Of course you can help by
making a financial contribution, but, you can also help by getting the word out
and sending our Indiegogo Campaign to as many people as you possibly can.  By Facebook, by Email, by Twitter or by 2

out and can help us reach our goal.  </p>

<p>Hello green
beauties! My name is Jenny. Seven years ago, my dream was to provide non-toxic,
eco-friendly beauty treatments and events. Just think--no more chemical smells
in salons. No more toxic garbage finding its way to soil and groundwater.
Through hard
work and inspired persistence, I made my dream happen in 2013—it is called <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/support-green-beauty-in-chicago/edit/www.noktivo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Noktivo Spa</span></a>, and
it is in Lincoln Square in Chicago. In just one year, my staff
and I produced a thriving business that brings
health and beauty to both people and the planet.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1214758/files/20150211113747-SpaParties_NoktivoChicago.jpeg?1423683467"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Unfortunately,
just as Noktivo was taking off, flooding and water damage forced us out
of our space. We have a <span><a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz/noktivo-chicago"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">proven record</a> </span>and an incredibly unique product. But
we exhausted our resources trying to keep our space that, now, we have lost. We
need your help now to build a new home for Noktivo.</p>
<p>We know how to do
this. We’ve
done it before, successfully. And, if we work fast enough, we will retain our
amazing and supportive <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/support-green-beauty-in-chicago/edit/www.facebook.com/noktivo"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span></span></a><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/noktivo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">client base</a>. We have
big, big dreams. We have a lot of energy—more than enough energy to make
those dreams happen. We just need a little bit of go-go.</p>
<p>Noktivo has
already changed the standard for health in beauty services in Chicago. Help me
build on that change. We are planning to open in a new space in July 2015.</p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You
Get</b></p>
<ul>
<li><u>We need $20,000 for Buildout</u></li>
</ul>
<p>Most of the money
we are raising is going to build the actual business, no fluff stuff; drywall,
painting, plumbing, flooring, lighting, equipment, signage, permits, licenses,
and so on.</p>
<ul>
<li><u>We need $3,500 for PR and
     Marketing</u></li>
</ul>
<p>Marketing
materials such
as postcards, flyers, brochures and business cards to tell new and
existing clients about our new space. We have produced our own marketing
materials and press releases in
the past, but handing this over to an expert would free up much needed time to
focus on the nuts and bolts of building.</p>
<p>We love
bartering! If a generous supporter wants to offer marketing services in
exchange for beauty services, we are so game! Please contact us via <a href=""noktivospa@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.noktivo.com/contact.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">email</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><u>We need $1,500 to cover unforeseen costs</u></li>
</ul>
<p>We have learned
this year that there will always be some ""Oh, crap!"" moments. We
don’t want unforeseen bumps to slow us down one bit!</p>
<p>Time is of the
essence. The longer we wait, the harder it will be to regain any lost
momentum. We have a loyal client base and dedicated, talented nail techs now.
Noktivo can’t afford to lose them!</p>
<ul>
<li><u>We win, you win!</u></li>
</ul>
<p>We've created
some amazing deals on day spa products and
services exclusively for Indiegogo supporters! I want you to come in and
experience the dream that has been dancing in my head and that you will have
helped make happen. Click on ""Perks"" to see ALL the fabulous
things you can get for supporting us!</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<ul>
<li>We've measured the ecological impact of a spa
     service from Noktivo versus from a traditional nail salon. Yep, that's
     right. We've done the math: each non-toxic nail service eliminates the use of close to 1lb per client,
      per year, of toxic materials. With our current customer base of
     1,200 beauties, that's literally over A TON of chemicals we save from
     entering our waterways each year. You, and the biodiversity of our Lake
     Michigan can rest easy.</li>
<li>We are able to source, 75% of our supplies and products from local
     manufacturers, primarily minority owned as well, keeping our dollars here
     in the local economy and reducing the pollution and packaging associated
     with transport.</li>
<li>Our exclusive Indiegogo shirts, hoodies and totes are
     designed and made <i>by </i><i><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/support-green-beauty-in-chicago/edit/www.vfishdesigns.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Vfish Designs</span></a></i>, a local woman-owned company. We are a mom-owned
     business supporting mom-owned businesses! </li>
</ul><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1214742/files/20150211113102-IMG_2407.jpg?1423683062"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<p>We are here to build a healthy beauty
community. Our business is for-profit, but, just as
importantly, our business is for-people. You can't create effective social change without both. Our bottom line is to foster a discussion of what we are putting on our bodies
and creating a <a href=""http://safecosmetics.org/article.php?id=90"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">healthy work environment</a> for technicians. We aim
to build on this through advocacy, education and <a href=""www.safecosmetics.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">lobbying efforts</a> for reform.</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>With great risk
comes great reward. Noktivo is being forced to expand two years earlier than my
business plan accounted for. While I am confident and ready to hustle for it to
happen, it still comes with risk. We will have to market and advertise a brand
new location; while some of our clients will follow us, some will not strictly
based on geography. </p>
<p>With the plan we
have in place and your support, I have no doubt at all that these barriers can
be overcome!</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>

<li>Spread the word! Share our
     campaign, share our mission and our plight! A good word goes a long way.

days, Bosnia and Herzegovina has suffered severe flooding, flooding that we
have not seen for at least 120 years.  Some people have lost their lives.  Some news sources say that 35 people have
been killed--many believe it's more—but the figures have not been made public
so as to not cause panic.  Many houses
have been damaged or destroyed, roads closed due to soil erosion, and bridges collapsed.  Even worse, some places do not have water,
electricity, and people have been moved to shelters where they need everything:  food, water, blankets and a place to stay.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">1, 500  hectares of agricultural fields are currently
under water.  Power supply stations are
also under water.  There have been over 1500
landslides from soil erosion in and around the city of Tuzla alone, and the
number of dead is still rising. Many bridges have been wiped away. Hence, the
road infrastructure is closed--and for many cities there is nobody going in or
out.  11.000 households are without electricity just in Tuzla.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The weather has taken its
first lives. What’s worse, it is said that landslides are moving some of the
unexploded landmines left over from the 1992-1995 war, which presents an
present an even bigger danger now. </p>
<p>It is estimated that this
has struck over 1 million people.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We do not have digital TV,
but luckily we still have an analogue signal so we can watch the news.  The police, fire departments,  and military are all fully engaged.  But more help is needed. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We at <b>Rotaract Club

days, Bosnia and Herzegovina has suffered severe flooding, flooding that we
have not seen for at least 120 years.  Some people have lost their lives.  Some news sources say that 35 people have
been killed--many believe it's more—but the figures have not been made public
so as to not cause panic.  Many houses
have been damaged or destroyed, roads closed due to soil erosion, and bridges collapsed.  Even worse, some places do not have water,
electricity, and people have been moved to shelters where they need everything:  food, water, blankets and a place to stay.  
1, 500  hectares of agricultural fields are currently
under water.  Power supply stations are
also under water.  There have been over 1500
landslides from soil erosion in and around the city of Tuzla alone, and the
number of dead is still rising. Many bridges have been wiped away. Hence, the
road infrastructure is closed--and for many cities there is nobody going in or
out.  11.000 households are without electricity just in Tuzla.
The weather has taken its
first lives. What’s worse, it is said that landslides are moving some of the
unexploded landmines left over from the 1992-1995 war, which presents an
present an even bigger danger now. 
It is estimated that this
has struck over 1 million people.
We do not have digital TV,
but luckily we still have an analogue signal so we can watch the news.  The police, fire departments,  and military are all fully engaged.  But more help is needed.

<p>Since Dylan is a Veteran of the US Army, we have become aware of a growing movement to retrain veterans into farmers. (For more info on this, check out the <a href=""http://www.farmvetco.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Farmer Veteran Coalition</a> and <a href=""www.groundoperations.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ground Operations</a>)  It makes perfect sense that farming, gardening, cooking and all of the associated tasks would be restorative to soldiers.  </p>
<p>We believe in appreciating these young men and women as people who believe in SERVING; people who worked hard and gained valuable skills to improve their lives. After the intensity of military life, some people wish for a change of pace and some personal restoration.  We want to offer people a place to learn all about food production, and allow them to contribute with whatever special skills or interests they may have.  For example, Maria was a mechanic in the Air Force and she comes to our farm to learn about cooking. Maria may earn room and board by helping with cooking, and she may earn extra cash by putting her mechanical abilities to use assembling our wind turbine, or fixing a tractor.</p>
<p>While Veterans represent a group near and dear to us, and they will receive priority for spaces, we plan to consider all types of people as students.  Individuals and families are encouraged to apply for a work-trade, or just rent a space for a short time.</p>

más fácilmente.

¿Dónde estamos?

Actualmente
tenemos una base del

de lectura directa sobre placas de muestra.  

Nos falta afinar detalles del software para tener una versión
terminada
del desarrollo y dedicarnos a
la producción. 
¿Porqué te necesitamos?
Todos tenemos un
amigo o conocido que a perdido o encontrado la mascota de alguien y nos dimos cuenta que cuando eso
ocurre, no existen formas que sean rápidas para
acceder a información vital de tu mascota entregando

Queremos minimizar todo lo posible que alguien pueda
perder su mascota. Necesitamos tu ayuda para lograrlo. Estamos
en una etapa en la que
solo falta el aporte económico y que sin
ti, no lo lograremos.

Rather than selling tickets, we used donations to cover the costs of the party.  This approach was very successful.We are now starting fundraising for this year's party. The system is simple enough. If we raise enough money, we get to have the Harvest Party. If we do not raise the money, we do not have the party, and everyone keeps the money they contributed/pledged. Recommended contributions are $30 per family. Larger contributions help us cover the costs of those who cannot afford to donate. There are many opportunities to volunteer your time and support our community at this event. Please contact Andrea at msmuppet@gmail.com for more information.Thank you,Your Harvest Party Team (Andrea Shullaw, Kristina Bulajewski, Sandee Lium,  and Scott Steinhorst)",0.0,0,"5 Campaigns
