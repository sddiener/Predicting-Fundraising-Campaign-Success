<h3>Hi everyone, and thank you for visiting my campaign. My name is Radek Vizina, and I am a painter who has had work juried into the S.N.B.A. Salon this coming December at the Louvre in Paris, France. A little bit about me..... I have been painting for 13 years.  I have studied art in Toronto and New York, and I spend countless hours drawing and painting. I have taught for the Continuing Education department at the University of Western Ontario and have also spent time in Europe restoring Palekh icon paintings.  I currently maintain a studio in London, Ontario, and have an upcoming solo show in January at The Art Exchange, a beautiful local gallery with a growing national reputation.  If anyone happens to be in London in January of 2014, come check out the show!</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<h4> Now about the campaign.... I am trying to raise money for what could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me - one which I hope will kick-start my career by giving my work excellent international exposure.  I have been selected to exhibit 3 pieces at the Louvre this coming December and need money to pay for all of the expenses which an endeavour like this entails. The cost of entering the show alone is €950, plus crating the work, shipping the work, insuring the work, etc, and I would really like to go and be there for the opening to see my work hanging at one of the most prestigious galleries on the planet. For a living artist this is huge! The show runs for 4 days, which means that I would fly from Canada to France, and then return with my work, which would then be stamped with an official S.N.B.A. logo on the back side.  I will be exhibiting a tribute to Trayvon Martin (pictured) , a portrait of my 4-year-old daughter, and a larger piece about hope and youth. I am very excited! Getting accepted has been an enormous break for me, now I just need to get my paintings and myself there.</h4>
<h4>
<br/> As far as funding goes…..</h4>
<h4>
<br/>The entry and administration fees are $1400.00 CAD. If I am able to go, then I will need a plane ticket which is roughly $1000.00, plus accommodation expenses which will be approximately $50.00 a night by 5 nights at a hostel, meals ($40.00/ day), personal travel insurance ($100.00)  and transportation while in France. I will also need a carry-on crate built for my work, which should cost $150.00, and insurance on the paintings which may run about $100.00. So all in all, with a little bit of wiggle room, just in case, the total cost will be $3500.00 CAD.<br/>If I am not able to go, the entry and administration fees are the same, the difference being that I will need to ship a fairly heavy crate to and from France, plus have someone look after the work upon its arrival.  I cannot get any estimates for shipping as of yet because I haven't had a suitable crate built yet, which will be more expensive and much more heavy duty than the one I bring onto the plane with me. The crate alone will cost $300.00 because it needs to be built to order specifically for the pieces I am shipping and to air freight cargo standards. </h4>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Now onto the perks!  I am offering my work - be they sketches, drawings, or paintings - to those who contribute to my campaign and help me see this fantastic opportunity through. All work will be signed and shipped to all of you who contribute, regardless of whether I reach my campaign goal or not. If I do not reach my goal and sending my work is no longer an option, or if I happen to surpass it, I will use the funds (or extra funds) to help pay for modelling fees and materials for the upcoming show in January.<br/>Once again, thank you so much for visiting my campaign, and for taking the time to read this. You can also add me as a friend on Facebook to see more of my work.  Help spread the word! I hope to be able to report back on the success of having my work shown at the Louvre!</h3>

When a girl is educated, the ripple effect is that she raises herself and her family out of poverty. Educate a community of girls and you raise countries out of poverty. This is increasingly essential as globalization truly unites the world as one. My name is Leah Lau. I am a photographer, writer and lifelong volunteer. I have traveled to all 7 continents and have dedicated my life to art and philanthropy to make the world a better place.In 2014, I will volunteer in Kenya at the Daraja Academy for girls. I will be photographing the school, the students, the teachers, the founders, the volunteers and surrounding Kenya to help raise awareness about educating girls. 
Your support will bring infinite good into the world: Through my volunteerism and photography, I will help shine a light on the school and raise global awareness of why educating girls in third-world countries benefits us all. 

I will provide professional photos to the school's founders to help them upgrade all of their marketing, communications, outreach and fundraising materials including their website, blog, videos, brochures, and more. 
I have also been invited by the school's founders to produce a photography book about the school with them! But, first, I need your help to get to Kenya!
What We Need & What You GetThe communities of Kenya struggle with extreme poverty but getting to Kenya is very expensive. Help me get there and I'll include you in the book's Thank You acknowledgments!

If you contribute to my fundraising campaign, you can get unique perks like the fine art photos that I'll make in Kenya, Thank You acknowledgement in the book, and copies of the book!


The travel for me to get to rural Nanyuki, Kenya, where the school is located, volunteer on-site at the school, and photograph surrounding Kenya for 2-3 weeks, will cost a base of $7,000.

The money raised will go toward core travel expenses including the roundtrip from San Francisco to Nairobi, Kenya; room and board while on-site at Daraja Academy; Yellow Fever vaccination; Malaria prevention medication; photography and computer equipment; overland travel, lodging and food in Kenya; and visa to Kenya. 
The ImpactWe are the change we seek in the world. Every contribution will make a positive difference now and for generations to come.
In Kenya, accessible public education ends at 8th grade. Most families cannot afford to send their children on to high school, which means that many girls from poor families are married off as young as 13 or are stalled out in lives of rural poverty. 
Daraja Academy interviews girls and identifies the driven future leaders of Kenya who otherwise would not be able to continue their education. Together, we can change the future of Kenya by raising up its girls and communities.
Many of you might remember the Cambodian Children's Book Project that I started in 2008 to build out the library for the ELMA School in rural Sambour, Cambodia. We reached success by 2010 and the school proudly had a library filled with hundreds of books donated by compassionate supporters like you from around the world.
Contributing and Other Ways You Can HelpVolunteering in Kenya is the next step in a lifetime of philanthropy and I would be honored if you would contribute and be part of the journey with me. Even if you can’t contribute financially, please feel free to spread the word to other like-minded friends and communities, connect with me about ways that you might be able to make in-kind donations, or volunteer with Daraja Academy or many other worthy organizations. We all need something to believe in.

<p>
</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Hello. My name is Jill
Enfield and I am hoping that you will consider donating to underwrite a project
that is scheduled to take place in December 2013. I would like funding to join
a group learning about the problems the area is facing caused by the pollution of
the Jordan River. The organization, Friends of the Earth Middle East (FoEME)
and a group of people of various faiths and backgrounds will be spending time along the Jordan River
to discuss the consequences of pollution over the last century. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Perhaps you know me as a
photographer and teacher, mainly interested in historical processes and I have
been asked to join the group and lead a workshop. The aim of this project is to
enable individuals to transcend superficial differences while engaging in a
creative and spiritual process focusing on the Jordan River as a vehicle of
mutual harmony. The blue colors of the photographic process known as cyanotype,
symbolize the elements of clean, blue waters and blue skies and photogram
murals by the river represent the common goal of bringing the river back to its
pure beginnings. The different components of such a mural can include a variety
of individually expressed themes using found natural and manmade objects, the
human form, words and symbols from the area. </span></p>
<p>SO WHAT IS A CYANOTYPE?</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The cyanotype --blue image on a white
background-- also known as the blue print process, was invented and named by
Sir John Herschel in 1842. Cyanotype is a perfect way to be introduced to a
non-silver technique because it is very simple and inexpensive. Cyanotypes are
made by using two chemicals: ferric ammonium citrate (the light
sensitive chemical) and potassium ferricyanide (adds the color) to
sensitize paper or natural fibers like cotton, silk and canvas or ceramic
pieces. Cyanotype is a very easy process to employ; once the solution is mixed,
it is then brushed onto paper or fabric and dried. It is a contact print
process --the object is the same size as the finished product-- and the
exposure is made with ultra violet light (sunlight) for five minutes up to
forty minutes. After exposure, the cyanotype is washed in plain water.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The placing of found objects on a sensitized
material results in a ‘photogram’. We can also use our own bodies, for example,
by lying down on the paper.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">A dialogue will be
started with the participants on how to best show what is happening with the
Jordan River, the environs and people. How can each faction help to bring
together everyone so that all can still benefit what is necessary to life and
what is considered holy by all faiths?</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The pollution of the
Jordan River is a universal concern. The aim of purifying the river or bringing
attention to the importance to such an effort can be a unifying theme for this
project and exhibition. The murals will travel to several synagogues, churches
and temples to help bring this story to others around the world. </span></p>
<p>ABOUT THE RIVER:</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The hugely politically sensitive Jordan Valley
- which marks the borders of Israel, Jordan, and Palestine - is facing
environmental catastrophe. Diversion of the River's waters for intensive
farming and domestic use, coupled with sewage and agricultural runoff being
discharged into it, has left the River's flow at under 5% of its capacity, and
extremely polluted. Not surprisingly, this has resulted in the ecological
degradation of the lower stretches of the River Jordan from the Sea of Galilee
to the Dead Sea, largely contributing to the shrinking of the Dead Sea as well
by over a meter every year. FoEME has been working for more than a decade to raise
awareness of the state of the River, with many rehabilitation efforts already
taking place: most pollutants will soon be removed from the River when several
Waste Water Treatment Plants will begin to operate; a commitment by Israel's
Minister of Environmental Protection to allocate 30 million cubic meters of
water to the River, (a drop in the bucket, but a start) - but a real political
commitment to return sufficient water to the River system, and to share it
equitably in the region, is the real challenge. </span></p>
<p>Rabbi Frank Dabba Smith:</p>
<p>“<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This is one of the most fragile eco-systems in
the world, in one of the most politically sensitive regions.  With the
peace process remaining at a very uncertain stage, the battle to save the River
Jordan, more fairly share and safeguard its precious water from unsustainable
use, provides a vehicle for practical action and collaboration across
communities"".</span></p>

<p>WHAT I AM ASKING:</p>

A big one. We see a nation brimming with culture, conversation and experience beyond any other. We see a nation basking in the societal benefits of pervasive creative experiences. We see a nation full of Artspoints Members who know that part of every dollar they spend supports the arts.<br/><br/>Artspoints Rewards is the vehicle to bring our vision to life. It is a national rewards program where Members earn points toward tickets to the arts and arts partners reap the rewards with larger audiences, great financial security, and therefore, more creative freedom.<br/><br/>We've run the numbers. We know we can make a huge difference. Did you know that another Canadian loyalty program generates over a billion a year in revenue? Just imagine every arts patron, every arts lover, every culturalista, participating in a rewards program supports the arts they love most.<br/><br/>Now that's <strong>social and cultural sustainability</strong>!</span></p>

A big one. We see a nation brimming with culture, conversation and experience beyond any other. We see a nation basking in the societal benefits of pervasive creative experiences. We see a nation full of Artspoints Members who know that part of every dollar they spend supports the arts.Artspoints Rewards is the vehicle to bring our vision to life. It is a national rewards program where Members earn points toward tickets to the arts and arts partners reap the rewards with larger audiences, great financial security, and therefore, more creative freedom.We've run the numbers. We know we can make a huge difference. Did you know that another Canadian loyalty program generates over a billion a year in revenue? Just imagine every arts patron, every arts lover, every culturalista, participating in a rewards program supports the arts they love most.Now that's social and cultural sustainability!
Simply, Artspoints is a membership-based rewards program that allows Members - people like you - to earn points and redeem them for tickets to the arts.
It's an innovative idea whose time has come. By using the power of points, Artspoints takes the tried and true model of rewards programs and applies it to the arts across Canada. Just like the airlines did when they were flying around with half-empty planes!
So far, we've partnered with 140 arts groups in the nation, and will have 200 on board when we launch.
This means Artspoints Members will be able to earn points when buying tickets to the arts and shopping at merchant partner locations. Points earned can be redeemed for tickets to any of our arts partner venues from coast to coast to coast. And when you redeem your points for arts performances, exhibitions and events, Artspoints pays the arts group for those tickets! 
Can you imagine hundreds of arts organizations across the country seeing their revenue go up without taking their eyes off what they do best -- delivering creativity and making our world infinitely more interesting? Yes? So can we.
""A city without strong, consistent arts funding is basically a parking lot.""
Douglas Coupland, Author, Artist, VancouveriteCities Summit 2012, Vancouver
The ImpactRewards programs have had a huge impact on the marketplace. Major loyalty programs have millions of members and generate millions of points that they use daily for reward purchases. By applying this model to the arts, we are rewarding pro-social behaviour, which in turn can have a positive and transformative influence on the arts.
How often have you attended an arts performance in your community where there were empty seats? Imagine how much better this experience would be for the performers, audience and the company's bottom line if the venue was full! With your support, we believe we can take the power of the arts to the world and start filling those seats.

 
What We Need & Why We Need It
Over the past year, we have built a small team who are working hard to take this from concept to reality, and in that short time a great deal has been accomplished. Our arts partners can't wait for the program to go live, and we have a small, but extremely dedicated, Membership base who are ready to start actively using their card.
""Artspoints Rewards is a great idea, whose time has come. Through the power of the internet and the technology we have available today, Artspoints is going to deliver arts experiences to a whole new generation of consumers.""
Christina Mattern, Manager, Marketing & CommunicationsCalgary Philharmonic Orchestra
Yes - Artspoints Rewards is a big program with lots of moving parts. And yes - we will ultimately need more than $75,000 to achieve our goals. But right now we have a set of critical hurdles to get past. A successful campaign will open the door to additional revenue, allow for growth and operating capacity needed to launch Artspoints Rewards. 
So, where will your contributions go?

To allocate additional resources to grow our merchant base
To launch Membership drive
To extend our reach to the French-Canadian market with bilingual website and marketing materials.
Above and Beyond
Reaching our $75,000 goal would be fantastic, so what happens if your contributions surpass our goal? If, through your support, our Indiegogo campaign raises more than $75,000, we will work hard to improve the Member experience, develop a mobile app, and much more!

What We've Done.
SDMP prides itself in producing high quality work no matter the size of our budget. We put on events by using our own creativity, and making the most of our resources. Our network of collaborators enables us to pool together a variety of skills and create a full, multi-faceted artistic event. 
We were able to help the 2012 Creative Nest's ""Welcome to Our World"" showcase reach its funding goal of $2500, and present our first multi-media dance piece “IN.”

We created a unique dance film as a public service announcement for the Foundation for Women's Cancer to promote awareness of cervical cancer and raise funds for their cause.

What exactly is the point of this project and why do we feel it should be publicly funded? I wish to make it clear that while yes, this is a new business venture, the *purpose* of the venture far exceeds any desire on my (Jason's) part to ""get rich."" We are specifically aiming to bring NEW gem cutters to market and to promote THEM and THEIR craftsmanship. This is not about me. This is about preserving and advancing the craft of precision gem cutting in North America. Will I make money on this? Probably. Will I get rich? Not likely. One cannot fund a venture such as this with no money and one certainly cannot pay the cutters a fair wage for their excellent craftsmanship with no influx of outside funds. </p><p>If our goal of promoting and preserving the craft of precision gem cutting is to succeed, it will take all of us who are interested in seeing this happen to work towards that goal. We are asking for your support in this venture. We are not asking you to make us fabulously wealthy or to help us take over the industry and put other people out of business. On the contrary, we cannot see how this project can do anything but promote the general welfare of the entire North American cutting industry. The greater the public awareness of precision gem cutting, the greater influence and productivity everyone in this genre will have. </p><p>If you have particular questions about my goals and hopes for this project, please contact me directly at jason@selectgem.com. I will be most happy to answer your questions. Respectfully and gratefully yours, Jason Brim.</p><h3>What exactly are we up to?</h3>
<p>(For those of you who like proper English, ""Up to what exactly are we?"")</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to fund the purchase of raw, uncut gem material that will be given to precision cutters to cut and market to a wider audience. High-end gems and collector stones are a niche market--go ahead, ask your local mall chain if they have <a href=""https://scontent-a-atl.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/t1.0-9/10150708_680983501937225_8843545742320153446_n.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Benitoite</a>. I dare you. </p><p>Jason Brim started Select Gem in 2002, and loves him some pretty rocks. We'll send our select team of cutters the rough gems, and they'll cut it and post it on his website under their own names. That way, customers can get to know the various styles and tendencies of the individual cutters, and they can gain increased exposure in the marketplace. From there, they can launch their own sites and stores, get fabulously rich, and buy Jason's house out from under him. </p><p>Okay, so we might not get filthy rich doing this, but we do love doing it. The curious irony of the gem world is that the glorious stones we read about, that are sold by the famous auction houses, that sit in the vaults of the one percent, that adorn the stars on Oscar night, are typically dug by dirt poor peasants or village co-operatives, and cut by dedicated individuals as highly skilled as they are poorly paid.</p>
<p>Precision gem cutting, in America and throughout the world, is a dying art. Seriously. It's mostly done by retirees, and them young whippersnappers can't be bothered to get off their iPads and pay attention to what makes it such a great art. Okay, that's a bit extreme. People of all ages do it, but there's a definite skew to the Boomers generation, and by some estimates, there are only about 200 professional precision gemcutters active in the United States. </p><p>Part of the problem is shopping mall economics, namely that less expensive (okay, I'll say it: cheap) mass-produced goods flood out individually-produced, one-of-a-kind works of art (OOAK to you Etsy types out there). Chain jewelry stores thrive on repeatable, low-cost goods to make their wares. That's okay, but the end result is that both consumers and jewelry store employees don't realize that the spectrum for quality of cut goes way beyond anything they've seen. That's just sad. </p>
<p>The airfare is already covered. So are the visas, translators, and ground crew. The website has already been built. The cutters are ready. We just need the shinies. We're looking to send Jason to Kenya and Tanzania with about $15,000 in his pocket, to buy needed rough gemstones for us to cut. That's where you come in. If we don't reach our goal, we'll still do the trip--learning the tricks of the trade from Roger (see below) is enough, but we have determined that the trip will be most cost-effective if we can bring back at least that much raw material.</p>
<h3>Bring on the nerd knowledge!</h3>
<p>Most colored gemstones (we're talking non-diamonds here, even though some ""colored gemstones"" are clear, and some diamonds are colored. Hush, you) that are sold in the United States are cut overseas by what many of us call ""native cutters"". We can almost guarantee you, sight unseen, that nothing sold in a chain jewelry store in North America or Europe was cut in the western hemisphere. Now, when we say ""native cutters"", that's not a perjorative term (neither is ""native flora"", right?). It's a descriptive term for people, generally near the original mine or in one of the big cutting houses in Southeast Asia, who cut the stones using what's called a jamb-peg machine.</p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""Diagram of a jamb-peg machine, just like your grandpappy's grandpappy's grandpappy used when he was a kid."" class=""fit lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/002/032/214/e8a6edc0277798e6daeb8d9659eaf334_large.jpg?1400554170"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>Diagram of a jamb-peg machine, just like your grandpappy's grandpappy's grandpappy used when he was a kid.</figcaption><figcaption><br/></figcaption></figure><p>Jamb-pegs have been used for hundreds of years, and given that everything is done by eye, some of the work is amazing. But it just can't match what a precision cutter can do with one of these:</p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""An Ultra-Tec faceting machine.

On the left is the original stone: inclusions, missed meets, asymmetric facets, but still purty. On the right, the same stinkin' stone after a recut by Ryan Quantz.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's amazing. Precision cutters cut the best stone (not necessarily the biggest) that they can given a piece of rough. That's using the perfect angles to maximize both reflection and weight, a design that avoids extinction (black spots on the edges of a faceted stone), and one that maximizes the shape of the original rough and accounts for any imperfections in the stone. A cutter in a big cutting house simply cuts the size stone he's told to produce, like an 8x10mm oval. He gets no points for perfect meets (where three or more facets come together), and really, with NO magnification, why should he be expected to do so? Precision cutters, on the other hand, do make perfect meets, and have at least a 10x magnifier at all times to check their work.

</p><h3>Ethical sourcing</h3>
<p>One of our goals with this project, and with Select Gem in general, is to ethically source our rough material. What does that mean? Why, I'm glad you asked. First off, if the mine owner insists you refer to him as ""Warlord"", that's a bad sign, but that's pretty obvious. We make sure the miners actually benefit from our trade, pure and simple.
</p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""One of our miners.

He has not only traveled extensively in East Africa buying rough, but has also a philanthropist supporting lapidary (you know, stonecutting) training programs in the area, so that the mining communities can cut the stones they produce. And did I mentioned world renown? He won the American Gem Trade Associaton's ""Cutting Edge"" award in 2007 and 2012, and you can see his work at <a href=""http://www.spectralgems.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Roger Dery Gem Designs</a>.</p>
<p>This will be one of Roger's last trips as a guide to East Africa, and it's time to pass on his knowledge. Jason will be literally following in the footsteps of a master, and will get to pick his brain at every turn, and benefit from the long-term relationships Roger has established over the years.</p>
<h3>The cutters</h3>
<p>We already have a stable of excellent cutters lined up.

What exactly is the point of this project and why do we feel it should be publicly funded? I wish to make it clear that while yes, this is a new business venture, the *purpose* of the venture far exceeds any desire on my (Jason's) part to ""get rich."" We are specifically aiming to bring NEW gem cutters to market and to promote THEM and THEIR craftsmanship. This is not about me. This is about preserving and advancing the craft of precision gem cutting in North America. Will I make money on this? Probably. Will I get rich? Not likely. One cannot fund a venture such as this with no money and one certainly cannot pay the cutters a fair wage for their excellent craftsmanship with no influx of outside funds. If our goal of promoting and preserving the craft of precision gem cutting is to succeed, it will take all of us who are interested in seeing this happen to work towards that goal. We are asking for your support in this venture. We are not asking you to make us fabulously wealthy or to help us take over the industry and put other people out of business. On the contrary, we cannot see how this project can do anything but promote the general welfare of the entire North American cutting industry. The greater the public awareness of precision gem cutting, the greater influence and productivity everyone in this genre will have. If you have particular questions about my goals and hopes for this project, please contact me directly at jason@selectgem.com. I will be most happy to answer your questions. Respectfully and gratefully yours, Jason Brim.What exactly are we up to?
(For those of you who like proper English, ""Up to what exactly are we?"")
The purpose of this project is to fund the purchase of raw, uncut gem material that will be given to precision cutters to cut and market to a wider audience. High-end gems and collector stones are a niche market--go ahead, ask your local mall chain if they have Benitoite. I dare you. Jason Brim started Select Gem in 2002, and loves him some pretty rocks. We'll send our select team of cutters the rough gems, and they'll cut it and post it on his website under their own names. That way, customers can get to know the various styles and tendencies of the individual cutters, and they can gain increased exposure in the marketplace. From there, they can launch their own sites and stores, get fabulously rich, and buy Jason's house out from under him. Okay, so we might not get filthy rich doing this, but we do love doing it. The curious irony of the gem world is that the glorious stones we read about, that are sold by the famous auction houses, that sit in the vaults of the one percent, that adorn the stars on Oscar night, are typically dug by dirt poor peasants or village co-operatives, and cut by dedicated individuals as highly skilled as they are poorly paid.
Precision gem cutting, in America and throughout the world, is a dying art. Seriously. It's mostly done by retirees, and them young whippersnappers can't be bothered to get off their iPads and pay attention to what makes it such a great art. Okay, that's a bit extreme. People of all ages do it, but there's a definite skew to the Boomers generation, and by some estimates, there are only about 200 professional precision gemcutters active in the United States. Part of the problem is shopping mall economics, namely that less expensive (okay, I'll say it: cheap) mass-produced goods flood out individually-produced, one-of-a-kind works of art (OOAK to you Etsy types out there). Chain jewelry stores thrive on repeatable, low-cost goods to make their wares. That's okay, but the end result is that both consumers and jewelry store employees don't realize that the spectrum for quality of cut goes way beyond anything they've seen. That's just sad. 
The airfare is already covered. So are the visas, translators, and ground crew. The website has already been built. The cutters are ready. We just need the shinies. We're looking to send Jason to Kenya and Tanzania with about $15,000 in his pocket, to buy needed rough gemstones for us to cut. That's where you come in. If we don't reach our goal, we'll still do the trip--learning the tricks of the trade from Roger (see below) is enough, but we have determined that the trip will be most cost-effective if we can bring back at least that much raw material.
Bring on the nerd knowledge!
Most colored gemstones (we're talking non-diamonds here, even though some ""colored gemstones"" are clear, and some diamonds are colored. Hush, you) that are sold in the United States are cut overseas by what many of us call ""native cutters"". We can almost guarantee you, sight unseen, that nothing sold in a chain jewelry store in North America or Europe was cut in the western hemisphere. Now, when we say ""native cutters"", that's not a perjorative term (neither is ""native flora"", right?). It's a descriptive term for people, generally near the original mine or in one of the big cutting houses in Southeast Asia, who cut the stones using what's called a jamb-peg machine.
Diagram of a jamb-peg machine, just like your grandpappy's grandpappy's grandpappy used when he was a kid.Jamb-pegs have been used for hundreds of years, and given that everything is done by eye, some of the work is amazing. But it just can't match what a precision cutter can do with one of these:
An Ultra-Tec faceting machine. Revel in the tech.Here's a quick example: 
Here's a Malaia garnet. On the left is the original stone: inclusions, missed meets, asymmetric facets, but still purty. On the right, the same stinkin' stone after a recut by Ryan Quantz.
Yeah, it's amazing. Precision cutters cut the best stone (not necessarily the biggest) that they can given a piece of rough. That's using the perfect angles to maximize both reflection and weight, a design that avoids extinction (black spots on the edges of a faceted stone), and one that maximizes the shape of the original rough and accounts for any imperfections in the stone. A cutter in a big cutting house simply cuts the size stone he's told to produce, like an 8x10mm oval. He gets no points for perfect meets (where three or more facets come together), and really, with NO magnification, why should he be expected to do so? Precision cutters, on the other hand, do make perfect meets, and have at least a 10x magnifier at all times to check their work.

Ethical sourcing
One of our goals with this project, and with Select Gem in general, is to ethically source our rough material. What does that mean? Why, I'm glad you asked. First off, if the mine owner insists you refer to him as ""Warlord"", that's a bad sign, but that's pretty obvious. We make sure the miners actually benefit from our trade, pure and simple.
 An East African miner. Strike a pose! They bust their arses to bring this out of the ground. Let's make sure they benefit from it. Yes, products from exploited workers are less expensive, but that's not what we're about.Our Guide
 All hail the Great Master, er, say hi to Roger.Roger Dery is a world-renowned gemcutter and also one of the big brains behind Sharing The Rough, a documentary film product tracing gemstones from the mine, to the cutter, to the jeweler who sets them in heirloom-quality masterpieces. He has not only traveled extensively in East Africa buying rough, but has also a philanthropist supporting lapidary (you know, stonecutting) training programs in the area, so that the mining communities can cut the stones they produce. And did I mentioned world renown? He won the American Gem Trade Associaton's ""Cutting Edge"" award in 2007 and 2012, and you can see his work at Roger Dery Gem Designs.
This will be one of Roger's last trips as a guide to East Africa, and it's time to pass on his knowledge. Jason will be literally following in the footsteps of a master, and will get to pick his brain at every turn, and benefit from the long-term relationships Roger has established over the years.
The cutters
We already have a stable of excellent cutters lined up. Peter Torraca, Ryan Quantz, Alan Unangst, Donn Law, Hans Durstling, Larry Hager, David Cooley, Christiane Morin, Arya Akhavan, and Eric Hoffman have all signed up. We won't show you their pictures--you can thank us later. But they're real. More real than your ""girlfiend in Wisconsin"", that's for sure.The risksWhen traveling to Africa, there's always the chance that you simply won't be able to complete the mission: weather, local events, global politics, medical issues, etc. It's rare, but it could happen.We could also get there and find out that some other group just came in and scooped up all the pretty rocks. The way to mitigate that is we're not just meeting with one or two agents, we have a whole mess of contacts in Kenya & Tanzania thanks to Roger. We also have back-up plans, like a trip to Sri Lanka.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

                                                                                                                       (english version below)

Wir - Kerstin, Paula, Daniel, Max und ich - haben einen Plan und brauchen dazu Eure Hilfe. 
Wir schaffen einen Raum, wo sich Kreativitaet und Gesellschaft verbinden. Seit geraumer Zeit feilen wir an dieser Idee. Jetzt sind wir startbereit!
Mal's an! wird ein Ort an welchem sich Jung und Alt treffen um Keramik zu gestalten und gemeinsam einen inspirierenden Tag zu verbringen. Hier kann man neue Techniken erlernen, seinen eignen Stil finden und den Spass am Malen ausleben.
Das Konzept:


Such dir dein Lieblingsstueck aus der Rohkeramik im Laden aus (Teller, Tassen, Fliesen, Schuesseln uvm.)
Finde deine Lieblingsfarben
Entscheide dich fuer eine Technik, die dir gefaellt (Mosaik, Blasen, Stempel, ...)
Male, probier dich aus, stempel und wenn du nicht weiter weisst, wir helfen gern!
Wir brennen dein Lieblingsstueck und du haeltst nach wenigen Tagen dein selbst gestaltetes Exemplar in der Hand

Wo stehen wir:Der Laden ist gefunden und wurde komplett renoviert. Die Innenaustattung nimmt Gestalt an. Der Laden in befindet sich in Löbtau im Gruen. Der Platz ist geschaeftig und reich an Familien und Kindern, mit Schulen und Kindergaerten in naechster Naehe. Neben Baecker-, Frisoer-, und Outdoorläden ist das Angebot für Kinder und Familien sehr spärlich. Deshalb schhafen wir einen Platz fuer:



Kinder, die sich am Nachmittag mit Freunden treffen, um gemeinsam zu malen und kreativ zu sein
jede Familie, die sich mit dem selbstbemalten Fruehstuecksservice oder der Kaffeetasse fuer Omi ein Highlight nach Hause holt
einen Nachmittagstee, um Baumschmuck zu dekorieren
Geburtstagsfeiern, Firmentreffen, gemuetliche Frauenabende u.a.

Jeder ist herzlich eingeladen auf der Kesselsdorfer Straße 36 in Dresden vorbeizuschauen. Damit wir uns keine Sorgen um das finanzielle Aus machen muessen brauchen wir deine Hilfe!






   Was wir brauchen und was du davon hast!
Wir brauchen euch um Bekannt zu werden. Macht Werbung fuer uns bei euren Freunden, Bekannten und Familie. Außerdem brauch wir eure Hilfe, um den Laden mit allem auszustatten, was noetig ist:
- Innenleben und Start up Equipment (Keramik, Farben, Kassensystem etc)- Brennofen- Werbekosten (u.a. Homepage)
Dein Gewinn:
Zu allererst (und am allerwichtigsten) wollen wir uns bei euch fuer die Hilfe und Unterstuetzung bedanken, unser Vorhaben zu verwirklichen. Ein kleines Dankeschoen wartet natuerlich trotzdem auf euch. Viele liebevoll bemalte Einzelteile werden euer Herz mit Freude erfuellen

  Was es uns bedeutet
Kurz und buendig:
Wir wollen Menschen zusammenbringen und das Freizeitangebot für groß und klein in Dresden und Löbtau vergroeßern.Wir wollen dass sich viele mit Spass und Farbe auszudrueckenWir wollen, dass alle schoene Erinnerungen mit nach Hause nehmen

I spent 2 weeks in March of 2014 at the Macaulay house doing research for Friend or foe #5, I came across the stories of people being haunted within the house, and the film maker resident at that time had a very scary experience.  I delved deeper into the house and the journals left by other participants. Reading their encounters or non-encounters was inspiring for me, as I have deep love of history. I realized that many of the people in the journals where former friends of mine who I had intimate relationships with over 20 years, some good some bad, these became one of the Haunting aspects of the place for me. In this project I am looking to write 5 songs for a live performance installation held at the end of my 5 week residency inside the house.

<h2><strong>A dream, fulfilled.</strong></h2>
<p>In April of 2001, I quit my job, left my apt. put my belonging in storage and fulfilled a long time dream to bicycle and sketch my way around the world.  A solo adventure that would take me through 16 countries in Southern Europe, the Middle East, the Sub-Continent, South East Asia, New Zealand and the US , pedaling 14,000 miles during a span of 14 months. </p>
<p>I came back in June 2002 with seven sketchbooks full of watercolors and stories. </p>
<p>What better way to share this adventure but with a book telling the tale of my journey with the very images drawn “in situ” and the journal entries.</p>
<p>After ten years going through my memories, the book is finished and after printing a prototype I do have a sense of completion, indeed.</p>
<p>284 pages, more than 600 hundred sketches and watercolors, the tale is told in words yet mostly in images, each drawing “hiding” it own story.</p>
<p>But a book is nothing without readers, and after studying my options I decided to self publish and print a limited edition of a 1000 books, 500 in English, 500 in French.  I am very excited to be able to share this story in both the language of my roots and that of my adoptive land.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Sharing</h2>
Self-publishing is another exciting adventure, but yes it involves funds and my hope is to use this campaign to allow you to pre-order the book, therefore allowing me to get some money upfront to go to print.  Printing 1000 books, full color with almost 300 pages (13 x 11) is quite an investment, but I am confident I can reach my goal with a little help.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I also would like to donate 5% of the sale of each book to the UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency helping families fleeing violence in Syria, a country now torn apart, where I experienced the greatest hospitality, and the most gentle people.</div>

<h2>Your help in ""writing the last chapter""</h2>
I hope to go to print towards the begining of the summer.  The amount I am trying to raise is not the full cost of the print run, but that would definitely help a lot for this project to see the light, and for the last chapter of this dream to be finally written.</div>

<h2><strong><br/>Un rêve, réalisé.<br/></strong></h2>
<h3>
<strong>Le titre français: </strong><br/><em><strong>Le monde au bout des rayons, le monde au bout du crayon.</strong></em>
</h3>
<p>En avril 2001, j'ai plié bagages.  Mes affaires dans la cave d'une amie, je suis partie réaliser un rêve: un tour du monde en bicyclette, carnets de croquis dans les sacoches.  Cette aventure en solitaire me verrait traverser 16 pays de part le sud de l'Europe, le Moyen Orient, l'Asie, la Nouvelle Zélande et les Etats Unis. 22.000 kilomètres pendant 14 mois.<br/>Je suis revenue en juin 2002, avec 7 carnets remplis d'aquarelles et d'histoires.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>Une autre aventure commençait alors: rassembler toutes ces mémoires, ces images, sous la forme d'un livre, et partager l'aventure.  Après 10 ans de travail, j'ai enfin un prototype, un sens d'avoir finalement écrit le dernier chapitre.</p>
<p>284 pages, plus de 600 dessins et aquarelles, c'est un carnet de voyage qui vous raconte cette histoire.</p>
<p>Un livre n'est rien sans ses lecteurs, et après bien des recherches, j'ai décidé de publier le livre moi-même en une édition limitée de 1000 livres, 500 en français, 500 en anglais.  Je me réjouis de pouvoir partager mon histoire dans ma langue natale et celle de mon pays adoptif.</p>
<h2><strong>Partage.</strong></h2>
<p>La publication à compte d'auteur est une autre aventure, et oui cela engage un petit capital!  J'espère pouvoir utiliser cette campagne comme pré-commande du livre, ce qui me permettrait d'avoir quelques fonds pour l'impression.  Un tirage de 1000 livres (33cm x 28cm - format à l'Italienne), de presque 300 pages, en quadrichromie, est un investissement, mais avec votre aide je suis sûre de pouvoir atteindre mon but.  </p>
<p>Je voudrais aussi donner 5% de la vente de chaque livre à une association humanitaire l'UNHCR, une organisation des Nations Unies aidant les familles syriennes à fuir la violence de leur pays maintenant déchiré, une terre où l'hospitalité et la gentillesse de ses habitants m'a profondément émue.</p>
<p><strong><a href=""http://www.unrefugees.org/site/c.lfIQKSOwFqG/b.4803595/k.E875/About_USA_for_UNHCR__the_UN_Refugee_Agency.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.unrefugees.org/site/c.lfIQKSOwFqG/b....</a></strong></p>
<h2><strong>Votre aide pour ""l'écriture du dernier chapitre"".</strong></h2>
<p>J'espère pouvoir lancer le tirage au début de l'été.  Le montant que j'essaie d'obtenir n'est pas le coût total du tirage, mais serait déjà une aide fabuleuse dans l'accomplissement de ce projet, et oui, l'écriture de ce ""dernier chapitre"".</p>

But a book is nothing without readers, and after studying my options I decided to self publish and print a limited edition of a 1000 books, 500 in English, 500 in French.  I am very excited to be able to share this story in both the language of my roots and that of my adoptive land.


Sharing
Self-publishing is another exciting adventure, but yes it involves funds and my hope is to use this campaign to allow you to pre-order the book, therefore allowing me to get some money upfront to go to print.  Printing 1000 books, full color with almost 300 pages (13 x 11) is quite an investment, but I am confident I can reach my goal with a little help.
 
I also would like to donate 5% of the sale of each book to the UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency helping families fleeing violence in Syria, a country now torn apart, where I experienced the greatest hospitality, and the most gentle people.

Your help in ""writing the last chapter""
I hope to go to print towards the begining of the summer.  The amount I am trying to raise is not the full cost of the print run, but that would definitely help a lot for this project to see the light, and for the last chapter of this dream to be finally written.
I am planning to go to print in June for a book release in the Fall.Feel free to share this with anyone you want, and Thank You in advance!
Un rêve, réalisé.

Le titre français: Le monde au bout des rayons, le monde au bout du crayon.

En avril 2001, j'ai plié bagages.  Mes affaires dans la cave d'une amie, je suis partie réaliser un rêve: un tour du monde en bicyclette, carnets de croquis dans les sacoches.  Cette aventure en solitaire me verrait traverser 16 pays de part le sud de l'Europe, le Moyen Orient, l'Asie, la Nouvelle Zélande et les Etats Unis. 22.000 kilomètres pendant 14 mois.Je suis revenue en juin 2002, avec 7 carnets remplis d'aquarelles et d'histoires.
Une autre aventure commençait alors: rassembler toutes ces mémoires, ces images, sous la forme d'un livre, et partager l'aventure.  Après 10 ans de travail, j'ai enfin un prototype, un sens d'avoir finalement écrit le dernier chapitre.
284 pages, plus de 600 dessins et aquarelles, c'est un carnet de voyage qui vous raconte cette histoire.
Un livre n'est rien sans ses lecteurs, et après bien des recherches, j'ai décidé de publier le livre moi-même en une édition limitée de 1000 livres, 500 en français, 500 en anglais.  Je me réjouis de pouvoir partager mon histoire dans ma langue natale et celle de mon pays adoptif.
Partage.
La publication à compte d'auteur est une autre aventure, et oui cela engage un petit capital!  J'espère pouvoir utiliser cette campagne comme pré-commande du livre, ce qui me permettrait d'avoir quelques fonds pour l'impression.  Un tirage de 1000 livres (33cm x 28cm - format à l'Italienne), de presque 300 pages, en quadrichromie, est un investissement, mais avec votre aide je suis sûre de pouvoir atteindre mon but.  
Je voudrais aussi donner 5% de la vente de chaque livre à une association humanitaire l'UNHCR, une organisation des Nations Unies aidant les familles syriennes à fuir la violence de leur pays maintenant déchiré, une terre où l'hospitalité et la gentillesse de ses habitants m'a profondément émue.
http://www.unrefugees.org/site/c.lfIQKSOwFqG/b....
Votre aide pour ""l'écriture du dernier chapitre"".
J'espère pouvoir lancer le tirage au début de l'été.  Le montant que j'essaie d'obtenir n'est pas le coût total du tirage, mais serait déjà une aide fabuleuse dans l'accomplissement de ce projet, et oui, l'écriture de ce ""dernier chapitre"".
Je compte lancer le tirage en juin, pour une parution à l'automne.Partagez ceci avec quiconque, et mille mercis d'avance!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The joy and sense of bringing people of unique backgrounds together that was experienced in that very moment sparked a whole new path for the single mantis, affectionately named <em>""Mantis Greatburn""</em>.<br/>The piece was immediately relocated for the sole purpose of being painted by everyone and anyone:<br/>artist, non-artist, lawyer, single mother, barista… The list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Over 100 participants gave the sculpture a new “skin” at the Painted Bride Art Center in Philadelphia during a month long residency in December 2011.

<p><strong>ThreadWritten Textiles</strong> is a home decor and women's accessories business that combines contemporary design with ethnic textiles, created in collaboration with international artisans.</p>
<p>My campaign will fund the production of my first line (a pillow, apron, table runner, and bag), using embroidery from Hungary and Romania. Incorporating Hungarian embroidery is a natural choice, drawing from the inspiration of the traditional costumes I saw while in Budapest on an artist’s residency in 2009. I am working with Kalotaszeg style “written” embroidery (table runner pictured above at left) that originated in a region of Transylvania, Romania, part of Hungary until 1922. My first products will include a pillow, table runner, apron, and bag-- all with the red tulip-based design pictured above on tracing paper and all in natural linen, staying true to the original form. The first bag prototype is also shown above, beneath the leather strapping and the tulip drawing.  The design has a great twist to it-- to be revealed this summer during sample production!</p>
<p>ThreadWritten has grown out of my photography and mixed media work, traveling in Europe, sewing bags for friends, taking a small business class, a love of design and art in everyday life, and connecting with people through service as a massage therapist. After researching PhD programs in textiles in 2011, I realized I could accomplish the same goal of traveling and studying textiles, independently, with the mission of creating a business, supporting the artisans I meet, and sharing their cultural heritage. <br/><br/>As a designer I strive for a balance between traditional motifs and contemporary forms. I encourage viewing textiles as cultural, social, and historical documents to “read”, as well as to live with and take comfort. I value simple beauty, art in everyday life, the joy of vibrant colors and patterns, and evidence of the artist’s hand.</p>

<h3>Gifts for You</h3>
<p>I have created a limited edition silkscreened tote bag and tea towel, currently for sale on etsy (<a href=""http://www.etsy.com/shop/threadwritten"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.etsy.com/shop/threadwritten</a>), specifically for fundraising for my first line.</p>
<p>For larger donations you will also receive a photograph from my trip or a small edition photograph from the trip with hand-stitching, similar to the mixed media work on <a href=""http://www.sarahpedlow.com/category/mixed-media/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sarahpedlow.com/category/mixed-media/</a>.</p>
<p>Here's where your contribution will go:</p>
<p>Sample Production costs in San Francisco for bag and apron: $500...  Airfare, SFO-BUD: $1,000... Lodging in Budapest and Transylvania (4 weeks): $800...  Bus/Metro/Train Travel: $250...  Fabric and supplies for samples in HU/RO: $100... Estimated artisans' wages for first samples: $100...   Materials and artisans' wages + SF productions costs for first line: $4,000.</p>
<p>These costs are above the $5,000 for which I'm asking.  Savings and extra massage work over the last several months will make up the difference.</p>
<p><strong><em>The most important step in moving forward is taking the trip to Hungary and Romania. </em></strong><em>Partial funding on indiegogo will enable me to start cultivating relationships and find high quality materials and craftsmanship.</em></p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>ThreadWritten aims to support women artisans, their communities and cultures, by paying fair trade wages, preserving the integrity of traditional styles and techniques, and educating consumers about lesser-known crafts that are disappearing.</p>
<p>Building relationships with people through design, supporting traditional textile work, and helping women create a sustainable livelihood are the most exciting parts of the business!</p>

Gifts for You
I have created a limited edition silkscreened tote bag and tea towel, currently for sale on etsy (www.etsy.com/shop/threadwritten), specifically for fundraising for my first line.
For larger donations you will also receive a photograph from my trip or a small edition photograph from the trip with hand-stitching, similar to the mixed media work on www.sarahpedlow.com/category/mixed-media/.
Here's where your contribution will go:
Sample Production costs in San Francisco for bag and apron: $500...  Airfare, SFO-BUD: $1,000... Lodging in Budapest and Transylvania (4 weeks): $800...  Bus/Metro/Train Travel: $250...  Fabric and supplies for samples in HU/RO: $100... Estimated artisans' wages for first samples: $100...   Materials and artisans' wages + SF productions costs for first line: $4,000.
These costs are above the $5,000 for which I'm asking.  Savings and extra massage work over the last several months will make up the difference.
The most important step in moving forward is taking the trip to Hungary and Romania. Partial funding on indiegogo will enable me to start cultivating relationships and find high quality materials and craftsmanship.
The Impact


ThreadWritten aims to support women artisans, their communities and cultures, by paying fair trade wages, preserving the integrity of traditional styles and techniques, and educating consumers about lesser-known crafts that are disappearing.
Building relationships with people through design, supporting traditional textile work, and helping women create a sustainable livelihood are the most exciting parts of the business!

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I'm a college student at UNC Chapel Hill studying history and Arabic. I got the idea for EMBODY from a reading for a class on Islamic History.</p>
<p>The book was called <em>Memories of Muhammad</em>. In a chapter about the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, the author mentioned how rosewater is a popular ingredient in deserts in Turkey, because many people view the rose as a symbol of the prophet Muhammad. So to consume the rose is to connect with the prophet, and in a way, is to embody the spirit of the prophet.</p>
<p>I was fascinated by this concept, because I love history, and especially the idea of living history (Williamsburg, Old Salem, Jamestown, UNC...NC/VA is a great area to visit if you're a history geek :)</p>
<p>Also, I love making things. I've learned a lot making this campaign. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why 5,000?</strong></p>
<p>Most of the contributions will cover the overhead for all the essential oils, the glass bottles, the perfumer’s alcohol, the stickers, the pamphlets, and the packaging materials. If the goal of 5 thousand is met, there will be enough funds after overhead so that I can prepare my next Indiegogo project idea, which I’m REALLY excited about.</p>
<p>It’s a product called “Mobi” that redefines everyday meditation. I’ll be WWOOFing this summer, but I hope to bring “Mobi” to Indiegogo by the end of the year with your help :)</p>
<p><strong>Also,</strong></p>

I’ve created a hard pin series called Critical, which showcases dozens of different endangered or critically endangered animals that I’ve drawn up and hand chosen for this series as beautiful hard enamel pins. If this project is funded, I will be donating all profits to wildlife conservations and funds to help save these amazing animals. Please help me reach my goals and help make a difference! These pins are all priced at a discount! If I surpass my funding goal and am able to have more made, the extra pins will be sold at normal price of $10 per pin plus $4 shipping. -This is a Fixed funding campaign. Its all or nothing. Meaning, the rewards will only be earned if we'd reach the initial goal and the other stretch goals. If we don't reach the initial goal, all funds will be returned.-Surveys will be sent after the campaign ends so you can select which pins youd like! -If funded, Pins will be put into production late september. Pins will take about a month to be made, and expected to be sent to me in October. Pins are expected to ship Late October/Early November 2019. -Funds from this campaign will be used to pay for pin production + shipping first, anything remaining will be donated to multiple wildlife conservations and funds. I will be working with https://twitter.com/DrWildlife to chose which to donate to. There are over 30 stretch goals to unlock! I will update this as we reach them!Current pin lineup:          This is my first time ever crowdfunding and I can only hope it will be a success!

In the spirit of the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/BurningManCORE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=' target=""_blank""'>CORE</a> (Circle of Regional Effigies) projects for Burning Man, this piece will serve to represent Catalonia at the international gathering. <br/></p><p>We have been working with local artists, designers, techies, and creators to produce this installation. Our goal is to create something that captures the intersection of Burning Man culture with the spirit of Catalonia, bringing both of these cultures together and sharing them with more people through Nowhere and the neighbouring community where the festival is held. After the event, the piece will be installed in a public space in the Monegros region, to be shared with the broader local community.</p><p>The full title of the piece is ""COR Pur Trencat Bategant"", meaning “Pure Broken Beating Heart” in Catalan. </p><p>The design is based on the concept of deconstruction, which challenges the traditional assumption of certainty, identity and truth. While to deconstruct can be a frightful process if one resists it, it can also bring us closer to our very essence. Thus the sanctuary-like space filled with reassuring heart beats in the interior of the installation. Once one surrenders to the process, they are on their way to once again reconstruct, re-create, play, and evolve.</p><p>The video below, produced by team member <a href=""http://leix.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Aleix</a>, beautifully illustrates the concept behind the piece as well as providing glimpses of the Nowhere environment that will surround it.</p><p><br/></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""435"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FS2FtRQC9AEI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DS2FtRQC9AEI&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FS2FtRQC9AEI%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p><p>One of the things that makes Burning Man so different from most festivals is the art; art that is not limited by the constraints of a museum, but instead is made for an outdoor space. This allows us to create art that can be larger than a building; art that evokes a different experience from day to night, or with wind or rain; art that can be touched; art that interacts with its users and challenges their understanding of reality; art that brings people together both to create it, and to experience it in interesting and unexpected ways once it's complete.<br/><br/>
We are excited to create and share such an installation on this scale here in Europe.  In the daytime, the sheer size of it will create shade from the hot sun. People will be able to spend time inside and write on the interior walls. At night, the piece will come alive with the sound of a heartbeat and illumination. There will be touch points and other interactive elements that enable participants to alter the heartbeat.<br/><br/>

We invite you to volunteer if you'd like to get involved in the project, and we are planning fundraisers that will include workshops teaching new skills to people.  We also want to share the piece itself with the community in the Monegros region of Spain where the festival is held. As part of the Growing Nowhere project, we are working with local leaders to have it placed permanently in a nearby town after the festival is over for the community to experience.Other Ways You Can HelpAside from contributing to this fundraiser, there are several other ways you can get involved:Spread the word:

Contemporary Dissonance is an exhibition like that of an experimental laboratory and artist playground, inviting young and emerging artists to showcase their own understanding of contemporaneity. No longer do these artists see histories of art and narratives as just intersecting and crossing over, but rather as a fluid and dynamic exchange that almost erases all sense of established identities and locales. They question the “East/West” dichotomy but moreover, they question the establishment of multiple narratives and histories: how do you separate one cultural identity from the other when the world you have experienced is fluid and dynamic?</p><p>The four artists in this exhibition, Katusha Jin, Eric Lau, Yvonne Kwok, Jessica Zheng, all from different backgrounds and upbringings, question the very narrative of art and experience in their own works. Through the different media of painting, fashion and photography, there seems to be this common thread that links these artists together -- a rejection of pre-existing labels and identities while also a sense of uneasiness as they fail to find an identity they can associate with. The result is an exhibition of works from these artists that seem to voice a contemporary dissonance to the currently established narratives and identities.  </p><h2>HISTORICAL EXPLANATION</h2><p>Under the increasing awareness of the interconnectivity and globalization of the 21st century, art historians have begun to critically examine our much traditional and out of date view on the history of art.

<p>Train of Thought is a 20-stop, creative journey from Victoria to Halifax this spring. We will travel along our country’s train routes, both present and past, and collaborate and conspire with growing numbers of artists, communities and fellow travelers along the way.</p>
<p>Train of Thought will involve workshops, performances, feasts, symposia, constant art-making and more. Along the journey we will collect and share stories, uncover buried histories and explore imagined landscapes of the land where we live: as it might have been, as it is, as it could be. </p>
<p>This traveling collaboration will have a focus on bringing together First Nations and settler/immigrant artists and communities across Canada.</p>
<p>Jumblies Theatre has raised funds to bring a team of core traveling artists - emerging and established - on this journey. However, we also have many colleagues who would love to travel on our Train of Thought and unfortunately our current funds can't extend to support them all. </p>
<p>Many of our partners who are trying to fund or partially fund their trips are professional artists who for whom a train ticket, accommodation and other travel expenses are not possible without your help. </p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Jumblies mandate is that ""Everyone is Welcome!"": Help us make that possible for Train of Thought! </b><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<p>• Taking a single person coast-to-coast costs about $5000, but with some travelers aiming to partially-fund the trip and many interested in traveling with us for only parts of the journey this campaign could raise enough to support 10+ artists and community leaders.</p>
<p>• Accordingly, if we don't reach our goal the money we do raise will still be vital in supporting a smaller number of travelers.</p>
<p>• Also, check out our perks! Most of them include original creations by Jumblies artists. Whatever gift you receive, it will be beautiful and lovingly crafted.</p>

Train of Thought is a 20-stop, creative journey from Victoria to Halifax this spring. We will travel along our country’s train routes, both present and past, and collaborate and conspire with growing numbers of artists, communities and fellow travelers along the way.
Train of Thought will involve workshops, performances, feasts, symposia, constant art-making and more. Along the journey we will collect and share stories, uncover buried histories and explore imagined landscapes of the land where we live: as it might have been, as it is, as it could be. 
This traveling collaboration will have a focus on bringing together First Nations and settler/immigrant artists and communities across Canada.
Jumblies Theatre has raised funds to bring a team of core traveling artists - emerging and established - on this journey. However, we also have many colleagues who would love to travel on our Train of Thought and unfortunately our current funds can't extend to support them all. 
Many of our partners who are trying to fund or partially fund their trips are professional artists who for whom a train ticket, accommodation and other travel expenses are not possible without your help. 
Jumblies mandate is that ""Everyone is Welcome!"": Help us make that possible for Train of Thought! 
  What We Need & What You Get

• Taking a single person coast-to-coast costs about $5000, but with some travelers aiming to partially-fund the trip and many interested in traveling with us for only parts of the journey this campaign could raise enough to support 10+ artists and community leaders.
• Accordingly, if we don't reach our goal the money we do raise will still be vital in supporting a smaller number of travelers.
• Also, check out our perks! Most of them include original creations by Jumblies artists. Whatever gift you receive, it will be beautiful and lovingly crafted.
   The Impact

• Train of Thought will be the latest project in Jumblies' 15-year history of productions which combine high-calibre art with radical inclusion and meaningful social results. 
• Train of Thought will bring together artists, leaders and community members to create alliances across barriers of both distance and difference.
• We have a focus on uncovering the hidden histories of Canada, particularly those of groups who don't always get to share their stories.

His father left when Billy was very young, and now  they struggle day to day just to get by. But just because they’re poor, doesn’t mean that momma isn’t going to raise Billy right. He is imbued with the ideas of treating all things smaller  than himself with gentleness and compassion and , most importantly, if you make a mistake you should apologize and make it right. Ideas like that seem unrealistic when you’re surrounded by crime, drugs and junkies all day. Billy’s world is a scary and desperate place.</p><p>That is until fate drops in and delivers a cold and hungry pug puppy into their lives. Nibbles changes everything, and now Billy doesn’t feel so alone and the world around them isn’t so bleak.</p><p>But things can change fast in the city… one day a local drug dealer, while running from a rival gang, accidentally hits Nibbles with his car. Billy’s world shatters around him and he and momma have no idea where to get the money to fix it. Billy was always taught to make things right if you make a mistake, so he decides to ask the dealer (Bump) to do the same. But when he confronts Bump, it begins a chain reaction of violent encounters that could threaten not only Billy’s life, but the lives of those around him.</p><p>But Billy knows no fear and he is unrelenting in his quest to bring his little friend back home to him. He only knows “Billy Love Nibbles” and will stop at nothing to make things right.</p><p>Now this is a very personal project for me. I’m one of those weirdos you hear about who is never going to have children but will always have lots of animals. They’re like my kids and I wanted to tell a story about how I’d do anything, in any circumstance, to protect them. As long as we’re being honest here, I don’t mind telling you that I had a very difficult time writing and illustrating the pages where Nibbles is hurt or being hit by the car. They filled me with so much dread that I avoided drawing them for months. That’s how powerful this book is for me. Even looking back on them now, my heart stops just a little bit. But it’s an essential component of the story that needs to be told… and a fear that I felt I must face in order to do the story justice.</p><p>When I was working on my last book  “Jeff”,  I was trying my hand at comedy. It was a huge departure from the standard action comic books I had grown up making. Now I’m embarking on another journey, but this time into tragedy. And, based on my own reactions in actually making the book, I think I’ve achieved my goal.</p><p>But now is where you guys come in. I’ve started this campaign to raise the $2500 that will cover the printing costs for “Billy Love Nibbles”. Why so little, you ask? <b>It’s because the book is done. It’s good to go.</b> I don’t need to pay artists or colorists or letterers. I don’t need money to market it because it will be under the banner of Creator’s Edge Press, the small press company that I co-own. We will take it to conventions and pitch it to stores though the company channels. The only thing I need assistance with is the actual printing of the book. This is for a 500 copy run and we hope that, if all copies sell, that we’ll have more than enough for a second printing. The reason for this is simple: I’m not taking any money from sales of this book. This book is my gift to Creator’s Edge, and the other comics we will produce in the future. <b>This book is a stepping stone to funding more interesting and original comics.</b> To help people who have a great book and no means to get it printed and out to a bigger audience. That’s my vision of Creator’s Edge Press and this is the only way I feel that I can help .</p><p><b>Also, a percentage of every book sold will be donated to the ASPCA and the Humane Society.</b> I care deeply about helping animals and if my art can get them some much needed funding, then I’m more than willing to do it.</p><p>But you definitely won’t be getting nothing but the satisfaction of helping indie comics and animals for your money… we’ve got some great perks lined up too.</p><p>At the $5 level, you get a digital copy of the book.</p><p>At the $15 level, you get a digital copy of the book and a hand drawn sketch card from me (any character you want – or I can think of something).</p><p>At the $25 level, you get a physical copy of the book, as well as the last 2 perks.</p><p>At the $50 level, you get the digital copy, the physical copy PLUS a 9x12 hand drawn piece (any character you want or I can draw something from the book).</p><p>At the $100 level, you get the digital copy, the physical copy PLUS an 11x17 hand drawn piece (again, any character you want or I can draw something from the book).</p><p>At the $150 level, you get all of that, but with any one page of interior art from the actual book (page requests will be on a first come, first served basis).</p><p>And finally, at the $250 level, you get a digital copy, a physical copy, an 11x17 piece of original art and ANY TWO pages of interior art from the book.

 Damanhur is a Federation of spiritual eco-communities, dedicated to diversity, action, solidarity, creating a joyful way of living together, and reawakening the divine spark of humanity. Nestled in the Alpine foothills in northern Italy between Turin and Aosta, it is a truly magical place. Click here to read more about What is Damanhur. 





What is the Open Temple?   

The Open Temple is a sacred space in Damanhur dedicated to freedom and openness, being open to different spiritual paths and philosophies. It is open to the sky and elements as a symbol of this openness of spirit. The Temple is available for individuals and groups who visit Damanhur from all over the world to express their unique connection with the sacred, in joy and harmonious union between humanity and divinity. 
The Open Temple is located on a very special energy point on the planet where four Synchronic Lines meet, so positive thoughts and actions resonate into the world. 






The project details

The Open Temple is located in the main center of Damanhur which is known as the Capital of Damjl. Everyone who visits Damanhur ascends on the Path of Hope entering into the Open Temple where the sky is the ceiling and the sun, moon and stars are the natural lighting. This sacred space was created by the citizens of Damanhur, who value collective art-making and expression as a way to bring everyone in the community together and accelerate our evolution. 
The objective of this project is to restore the floor of the Open Temple, which is the first part of a three-part project: floor, statues and columns. At the moment only the first two steps of seven have been completed, therefore, we just need your help to complete five more. They will be resurfaced using a technique known as terrazzo which makes it possible to use the area all year round despite weather conditions such as ice and snow.
As shown below, each step will be enhanced with circular spiral patterns as a symbol of life. A complex series of blue and white lines creating a walking meditation labyrinth will guide the pathway for spiritual exercises involving rhythmic steps and movements. The central mosaic will be created using an artistic technique with an aggregate of chips from red granite, carrara white and black marble. The predominant color will be red, like the original columns and terracotta sculptures. The spiral pattern in the center of each step is a recurring theme throughout the Open Temple.

<p>
FASHION ALLIANCE WORLD (formally
Fashion Alliance Intl) was founded in 1989. Fashion Alliance World Inc. was
created to bring together fashion designers, merchandisers, illustrators,
photographers and models, hair/make-up and stylist to join forces in promoting
the growth of the fashion industry in South Florida, and to showcase the work
of the Alliance members. Fashion Alliance World, South Florida will be actively involved in supporting and
providing exposure for new and upcoming designers, through our shows, local
boutiques and national and international marketing promotions. A variety of
programs, and events, will be prepared to generate interest in the fashion
industry, and to attract national and world interest in South Florida
designers. Throughout the year Fashion Alliance will present at least four
different fashion events. Some will be for members of the fashion/art industry
only, and others will be geared towards retail buyers, to heighten their
knowledge of the fashion/art industry. These events will be a potpourri of
entertainment and business, even events within themselves. Every December the
organization will kick off the holiday season with a glittering gala, which
will provide an opportunity to showcase, and recognize, the talents of young,
trendsetting and innovative designers from South Florida and beyond. We have
done a number of events over the years and we are moving on hoping to continue
the journey of love, “fashion.” Visiting our website you’ll find information on
our previous and present projects at FASHIONALLIANCE.NET.  </p>
</div> <div> <h3>Theme: Josephine Baker</h3> <p></p>
<p>
THEME:
Josephine Baker the first black superstar (June 3, 1906 – April 12, 1975) was
an African-American, a Civil Rights Activist, dancer, singer, and actress who
found fame in her adopted homeland of France. She was given such nicknames as
the “Bronze Venus”, the “Black Pearl”, and the “Créole Goddess”. Josephine
Baker became wildly popular as an American dancer and singer who brought the
essence of the Jazz Age to Paris. Widely known for her daring costumes such as
the banana skirt that she used to perform her famous “banana dance” and exotic
cabaret performances; no wonder she was characterize and defined as the beauty
of that period. She was also an early civil rights activist and the mother of
12 adopted children known as her “Rainbow Tribe.” In 1961, Josephine was
awarded the Legion of Honor, France's highest award.</p>

<p>Fashion
Alliance is requesting fashion designers, artists, dancers and singers to

groundbreaking fashion designers and artists are being asked to send in
two-sketched illustrations of their personally favorite from Josephine Baker;

position and why they believe that the style from their research has the
cutting edge that makes their design unique and real must accompany your
illustrations. The deadline for all entries is January 10, 2016. In

""five-W"" rule to sum up your findings: Who is the person, what made her
important, when was her influence applicable, where was her influence
practiced, why is this person important. Upon considering the “five W’s”
Josephine will become dramatic to the eyes and mind. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Prizes For Winners</h3> <p></p>

industry, and to attract national and world interest in South Florida
designers. Throughout the year Fashion Alliance will present at least four
different fashion events. Some will be for members of the fashion/art industry
only, and others will be geared towards retail buyers, to heighten their
knowledge of the fashion/art industry. These events will be a potpourri of
entertainment and business, even events within themselves. Every December the
organization will kick off the holiday season with a glittering gala, which
will provide an opportunity to showcase, and recognize, the talents of young,
trendsetting and innovative designers from South Florida and beyond. We have
done a number of events over the years and we are moving on hoping to continue
the journey of love, “fashion.” Visiting our website you’ll find information on
our previous and present projects at FASHIONALLIANCE.NET.  
  Theme: Josephine Baker 

THEME:
Josephine Baker the first black superstar (June 3, 1906 – April 12, 1975) was
an African-American, a Civil Rights Activist, dancer, singer, and actress who
found fame in her adopted homeland of France. She was given such nicknames as
the “Bronze Venus”, the “Black Pearl”, and the “Créole Goddess”. Josephine
Baker became wildly popular as an American dancer and singer who brought the
essence of the Jazz Age to Paris. Widely known for her daring costumes such as
the banana skirt that she used to perform her famous “banana dance” and exotic
cabaret performances; no wonder she was characterize and defined as the beauty
of that period. She was also an early civil rights activist and the mother of
12 adopted children known as her “Rainbow Tribe.” In 1961, Josephine was
awarded the Legion of Honor, France's highest award.



   About This Project  
Fashion
Alliance is requesting fashion designers, artists, dancers and singers to
research the life of Josephine Baker and present their findings in an artistic
fashion. Designers, artists, Dancers and Singers who believed that they have
what it takes to accentuate themselves, surrounded by the present yield of
groundbreaking fashion designers and artists are being asked to send in
two-sketched illustrations of their personally favorite from Josephine Baker;
dancers and singers will send a one-minute DVD of their findings. For final
year student designers/artist must submit a 300 words essay stating their
position and why they believe that the style from their research has the
cutting edge that makes their design unique and real must accompany your
illustrations. The deadline for all entries is January 10, 2016. In
your research please look at Josephine Bakers life be specific and use your
""five-W"" rule to sum up your findings: Who is the person, what made her
important, when was her influence applicable, where was her influence
practiced, why is this person important. Upon considering the “five W’s”
Josephine will become dramatic to the eyes and mind.    Prizes For Winners 

The winners will receive $5,000 each OR a trip to Paris to
visit fashion/art houses, art galleries and places where Josephine Baker
performs and became famous as a Jazz singer/dancer.Our Partners

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>A Webcomic with ambitious designs, it aims to tell the story of the World of Ascension. Populated by characters that range from the black and white, the demons and angels, to the grey toned characters that exist inbetween the two polar opposites in a world known only as Ascension.<br/><br/>Following the fortunes of a Paragon, an immortal being given great powers with a deathwish at her deepest core we see the world through her eyes to begin with, across a vast tapestry of time. The World changes, and she witnesses it all...<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I'm making this campaign as I have a set list of aims I desire to achieve;</p>
<p>1) I wish to be able to update and upkeep the webcomic ( The Condemnable ) with timely grace aside from my own full time job.<br/>2) I am wanting to turn the World I am creating into a fully fledged roleplaying game, much like Exalted and DnD, with exciting classes, magic systems and a world fleshed out with impossible and wonderful things.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The impact of a funded campaign means I can ease off with working my fingers to the bone and look more closely at the needs of my webcomic and designed roleplaying system. I work a full time job and I care for my disabled family, leaving me little time between the two and my own personal life to achieve the dreams I've had since childhood.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need time and money, it's as simple as that. I need to be able to afford the webspace for my webcomic as well as web advertising for it. I need to be able to ease up with work hours to make the webcomic a reality, as something I want to do as my career.<br/><br/>What you get is the satisfation of helping a young (well young-ish) artist achieve her dreams and goals despite heavy adversity. For anyone who contributes over £20 to my cause, I will give a free piece of artwork. Should my funded goal be met, I will update regularly, and offer additional services.<br/><br/>Planned in the works are;<br/><br/>1) A seperate side comic called 'Lvl Up Noob!' - there's a million and one gaming comics out there, so this is more of a freebie for my regular readers.<br/>2) Livestreaming - I will set aside time to livestream artwork for my readers, as well as tips and tricks.</p>
<p>3) A gaming journal and forums - I want an interactive and friendly community where people of all types can come to showcase art, trade help and of course my biggest love, gaming.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can help me by putting the word out there! I need as much help as I can get to fund the time needed to make my dream a reality and hopefully add to the world I live in, with a world of my own.<br/><br/>NOTE: All sketches are done digitally, as I lack any capability to print off pictures etc, so note me with your perk price range and sketches/art will be done asap!!!</p>

<h3>What is Across the ages?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>This project is an art website containing a collection of illustrations on historical themes. Anyone will be able to travel back to any era and look at the Viking ships or pirates, enjoy the beautiful palaces and visit the battlefield. Also all images will be assembled into a digital artbook. Also in the future we plan to add a bit of video - small sketches on a historical theme.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The project will be finished anyway, but with your help we can make it more qualitatively and faster. After the site will be started, anyone can visit online gallery absolutely free of charge.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The estimated cost to complete this project in full is $5,000 - a very small price to bring such beauty into the world. </p>
<p>If we raise enough money, we will be able to pay for website development and for hosting, and we will be able to continue to create illustrations to complete the project.</p>

</div></div>","What is Across the ages?

This project is an art website containing a collection of illustrations on historical themes. Anyone will be able to travel back to any era and look at the Viking ships or pirates, enjoy the beautiful palaces and visit the battlefield. Also all images will be assembled into a digital artbook. Also in the future we plan to add a bit of video - small sketches on a historical theme.



The Impact

The project will be finished anyway, but with your help we can make it more qualitatively and faster. After the site will be started, anyone can visit online gallery absolutely free of charge.



What We Need & What You Get

The estimated cost to complete this project in full is $5,000 - a very small price to bring such beauty into the world. 
If we raise enough money, we will be able to pay for website development and for hosting, and we will be able to continue to create illustrations to complete the project.

<p>FAQ</p>
<p><b>How do I get a Nook
modular wine rack?</b></p>
<p>The only way right now is to order through this page. You
will be the first people in the world to own a Nook wine rack at a price
significantly below our RRP. After that, head on over to nookwineracks.com to order.</p>
<p><b>Why is your wine rack
better than existing designs?</b></p>
<p>This is what inspired us to release Nook! We recommend doing
your own research to see what we mean! Nook is sleek, modern and truly modular.
Other solutions out there currently are as follows:</p>
<p>- 
Timber/traditional style – Outdated look,
inflexible configuration, limited capacity, expensive</p>
<p>- 
Chrome metal wire style – Outdated looked,
inflexible configuration, limited capacity</p>
<p>- 
All plastic/low cost designs – Unattractive and
cheap appearance, some with inflexible configuration</p>
<p>- 
Traditional wood/steel – Outdated look,
inflexible configuration, difficult assembly</p>
<p>- 
Wall mount solutions – Expensive, require
installation, limited capacity, potential safety risk </p>
<p>- 
Custom/high end/designer racks – VERY EXPENSIVE,
some require installation, inflexible configuration, often with limited
capacity</p>
<p><b>I don’t know where to
put it/I don’t know if I have space for one?</b></p>
<p>The beauty of Nook is you can put it virtually anywhere, you
can build it to fit your space. You can even build multiple smaller wine racks
and put them in a few places! Everyone has a nook such a cupboard that they
could use! </p>
<p><b>Surely there is a
wine storage system out there like Nook?</b></p>
<p>NO! That is why we created it! </p>
<p><b>How do I choose my
colour?</b></p>
<p>If we reach 100k we will release off white and Candy Red
colours. After the campaign finishes, we will send out a survey after the Indiegogo
campaign has finished where you will select your colours. If you ordered more
than one pledge level you can specify the colours of each. </p>
<p><b>I just want a normal
wine rack… Can Nook do that? </b></p>
<p>Nook does everything that standard wine racks do. You can
just build it into a square or rectangle shape if you wish. </p>
<p><b>How difficult is it
to assemble?</b></p>
<p>There are only two pieces, it’s very simple. You assemble
the rack loosely(on it’s back) to the size you need, check it will fit in the
space and then knock the metal pieces in as far as they will go with a rubber
or nylon mallet. Simple as that. </p>
<p><b>Who manufactures the
wine rack?</b></p>
<p>We have a production company who are very experienced and
highly professional in all aspects of manufacture and packaging. </p>
<p><b>Why is international
shipping so expensive?</b></p>
<p>It is expensive to ship items internationally. We created
the international pledge based on rates obtained from our shipper. In some rare
instances with very expensive shipping, an additional surcharge may apply if
the shipping is significantly above what you are paying! We will refund your
money if you are not happy with the shipping surcharge.</p>
<p><b>You guys are in
Australia, why is it classed as international to ship to Oz but free in the
USA? </b></p>
<p>Based on our research, our USA orders will be around 2/3 of
the total orders so it is viable to send a shipping container there and post
from within the USA. The other 1/3 will go all over the world so we will post
from our HK despatch facility. </p>
<p><b>I have kids, is this
product safe?</b></p>
<p>Nook is a very safe and sturdy product, made from non-toxic
materials, but like any item in your house if it’s in reach of kids or it’s
built above 4’, we suggest attaching it to an adjacent wall with our wall mount
bracket. </p>
<p><b>I’m a retailer/online
seller/distributor and I’m interesting in selling Nook  </b></p>
<p>We would love to hear from you! Contact us directly to
discuss reselling our product. We are keen to have Nook in shops soon. </p>

</h3><div>
</div>
<p>Hi, my name is Anne and I am an artist
and ecologist, totally addicted to colour and patterns in nature. I currently
live in Fiji where I volunteer for NatureFiji –MareqetiViti. I have enlisted
the help of my fabulously talented arty daughter, Cathy, who lives half a World
away in Scotland. Together, we want to raise awareness and funds for Fiji’s
unique wildlife with our beautiful collection of hand drawn illustrations, <b>Colour-in Paradise</b>: a colouring book
for all ages that will benefit species conservation. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444746179/qldi8tavev5emg9i35gh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p><b>WHY A COLOURING BOOK </b></p>
<p>Adult colouring books are hugely
popular for their stress relieving properties and their ability to bring out
our inner child. With 20 intricate drawings of Fiji’s beautiful flora and fauna
printed on single sided quality paper <b>Colour-in
Paradise</b> is perfect for anyone interested in wildlife or looking to make a
difference. We hope that as people colour our beautiful hand drawn impressions
of Fiji’s unique creatures, they will not only relax and have fun as they
de-stress, but also fall in love with the animals and plants they are
colouring. </p>
<p><b>WHY COLOUR-IN PARADISE IS
DIFFERENT</b></p>
<p>All money raised in this
campaign will pay for the costs of printing Colour-in Paradise books, limited

much-needed funding for NatureFiji-MareqetiViti to use for important species
conservation. With your support, in addition to the benefits of ordinary

<p><b>IMPACT</b></p>
<p>Fiji really is a paradise. Its
beautiful untouched forests and incredible wildlife can be found nowhere else

are on a mission to protect it. They aim to enhance biodiversity and habitat
conservation, to protect endangered species and create a sustainable use of

a huge amount of funding and they need our support. </p>

<p><b>WHAT WE NEED AND WHAT YOU GET</b></p>

our colouring book, but a series of post-cards which people will be able to
colour and send to friends. It would also include the printing of limited
edition A3 prints of the same 6 postcard designs, hand-coloured by Anne. Think
of the fun and awareness- raising your help will bring around the World! You
will be supporting the conservation of some of the rarest creatures on
Earth.</p>

What is the project?
  In a presentation that can be described as interactive therapy, “Recover” brings the artists’ healing process to their audience. Borne Dance Company has gathered a collective of musicians and movers of varying dynamics for an evening of artistic expression and inspiration. In the pursuit of art appreciation in all forms, the evening will also include original works of art from the realms of music, literature and photography. In the spirit of making art accessible to everyone in our communities, admission will be donation-based, so thanks to Indie Go-Go and sales of donated pieces of art from local collaborating artists, we are able to make this event happen.

<p>Ceno2 is one of the most successful and sought after graffiti artist in Singapore. He has
developed his unique style of creating ‘lifelike’ portraits and landscapes that are all painted
with using the humble SPRAY CAN. Ceno2 has developed and refined his ability to maneuver
and render his pieces by use of spray paint solely without the help of sketches, outlines or block
painting.
</p>
<p>With a background in Fine Arts (graduated from Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts), Ceno2 decided
to go against traditional painting methods of using a brush and challenged himself to learn the
art of using spray paint to convey his art. Ceno2’s art has managed to capture the attention of
small businesses to corporate levels. They have commissioned him to paint a wide range of
paintings and sizes, ranging from: one office wall to the side of a six story building. He also has
been commissioned for artworks in Chicago during his first visit. He made his way to Chicago,
partly paid for by the Singapore International Foundation Arts Grants, to attend the Annual
‘Meeting Of Styles’ which is an international graffiti event. Attending the event allowed for
more opportunities for Ceno2 as has has been invited to Gallery Bar, Chicago, for an upcoming

Step right up, folks! Step right up! Welcome to the YEE-SAW Carnival! Featuring the sentinel of all seesaws, the behemoth of balance beams, the giant of jungle gymnasiums, the monster of monkey bars, the YEEEEEEEE SAW!<applause>Standing at nearly 30 ft. tall with a 35 ft. wingspan, inner spinning merry-go-round seats (safety belted of course), springs, lights, monkey bars, dance platforms and ACTION! Fun for the kid in all of us. A menagerie of playground equipment that has outgrown the schoolyard and matured to cast glowing smiles on the child in all of us. Made out of wood, metal, and sweat this machine will launch you into the clouds of Black Rock City and bring you back down safely again and again.Our goal is simple. We want to bring this machine to the West Coast BM Arts Festival as a representative of Houstonian interactive art culture. The contraption has already been contrapted. The construction is complete. We have practiced moving it and we have a seasoned crew that has field tested assembly and breakdown twice for a regional festival. Now, we just need to get it onto The Playa.As you might think, transporting such a monstrosity across the country might be expensive. You would be right. This is where we beg you for money. We will try not to be too obvious about it.What We Need & What You GetThe least expensive option of getting the YEE-SAW to Black Rock City is by contracting a semi to deliver it to our campsite, leaving the trailer there for the week of the festival, and returning it once we are done. This means we have a fun shade structure to play in also.That costs 10K. We set the goal lower because the YEE-SAW only takes up half the space. Luckily, we are working with Houston CORE, the Sound Dome, Meditation Deathmatch, and a local art car to bring their setup in the same haul. Donating to us helps them as well.You won't walk away empty handed. First and foremost you get to play on the YEE-SAW. Second to that we have fabulous perks and prizes to receive either in BRC when you find the YEE-SAW or at the fundraiser event on July 18-20 in Houston at Independence Art Studios (419 Janisch Rd). Of course there are stickers and t-shirts. An Indiegogo campaign has to have those. They are staples. But we are offering hard hats, tchotchkes, and screen-printed-while-you-wait, one-of-a-kind YEE-SAW prints as well as tickets to the limited invite Preview Party on July 18. You can only get tickets here on Indiegogo to that auspicious occasion filled with performances by aerialists, acrobats, fire wielders, live music, electronic dance music, and complimentary refreshments provided by Prego Houston, League of Extraordinary Brewers, and Real Ale.

<h3></h3>
<p>My name is Ian Sherwin and I have been passionate about making art since I could remember.  It's simply what I was born to do! Even after a tragic accident in 2004 that left me blind in one eye, I did not let that stop me from continuing to create art and teach with fervor. I re-learned how to draw and paint and pressed on with my life's work. I am thankful every day for the ability to create and share art and thankful that my blindness has actually given me sight. My disability has helped me find innovative avenues of expression/teaching methods. </p>
<p>If you haven't watched the video above - please take a look to learn a little more about me!</p>
<p>I have been a full-time fine art painter and teacher for the past 20 years and it's been such an exciting journey. As a young man, I had a clear vision for what I wanted my future to look like as an artist and have been immensely blessed to see those dreams come to life one by one as I've pursued my goals.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>BUT, I DREAM BIG.... SO THERE'S STILL A LOT MORE TO COME </b></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><b>AND THAT'S WHY I NEED YOUR HELP!</b></p>
<p>Going off of faith and a gut feeling, I made plans to leave all I knew in the Wrigleyville Gallery and find the perfect space to open my dream gallery in Humboldt Park in a neighborhood where I can continue my journey with:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Teaching and learning from autistic children, special needs children/adults through the beauty of visual art</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Providing opportunities for young, aspiring artists to achieve their goals and dreams /showcase their work</span></li>
<li>
<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">Utilizing a space that is the perfect size to finally create all the classes I've dreamt of teaching</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p>How I Want To Utilize The Space:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Teach classes to special needs children and adults in the Chicago area (I've been told by several people that I have an innate gift in the area of teaching those with special needs and I have been truly fulfilled in these experiences. I yearn for more! I would love the funding to create a full curriculum and weekly classes for this as well as the ability to offer free classes to those from low-income households who could benefit from my teaching. Those of you who love or know someone with special needs understand what a benefit it truly is when a special needs person is connected to a new means of communication with their beautiful minds)</li>
<li>Be able to offer affordable rentals and space to up-and-coming artists of all kinds - be it visual, theater, music, improv, or poetry - all art is beautiful and welcome -with a specific focus on Humboldt Park residents (For all you artists out there- I understand the challenges of being an artist and was once in your shoes! I want to help you get your careers going and share this vibrant space with you!)</li>
<li>Rent the space for all kinds of events  (I want the space to be used for memorable occasions for those in the neighborhood and city of Chicago to experience the gallery with us and to be exposed to new art while enjoying a special day or evening)</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>Classes I Want To Offer:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Art Therapy </li>
<li>Art Therapy for Special Needs Children </li>
<li>Art Therapy for Special Needs Adults</li>
<li>Children's Art Courses</li>
<li>PibSqueaks and Power Tools</li>
<li>BYOB Painting Classes</li>
<li>Origami Bouqet Building</li>
<li>And Many More Never Before Seen Classes (But shhhh! I don't want to give away ALL the mind blowing classes that I have planned! )</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<br/>
</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I have put a lot of time, money, blood, sweat, and tears into getting this space up and running. This has included hours upon hours of work - planning, painting, patching, cleaning, phone calls, emails, teaching, teaching, teaching, connecting, marketing, and sharing the space with low-income, local artists to showcase their work. </p>
<p>The gallery is already proving successful and has had some phenomenal events (most recently the Field Work Exhibit). I've proudly given opportunities to young artists in Chicago and I've been blessed to teach and inspire numerous friends, clients, and strangers in this new space. As an added bonus, I've been fortunate enough to sell several pieces of up-and-coming artists' work. </p>
<p>But, now I need your help! I really want to get the ball rolling  so I can expand the gallery and enhance what I've built here. I'm sure you all know what it's like to have a dream and have mapped out a plan to get there - and I would so appreciate your help! I need you. Yes YOU! To help me in getting the rest of the pieces into place so I can share my passion with those who can utilize it best. Let's take a look at how this $25,000 goal breaks down. Specifically, I need help paying for:</p> <ul><li>Art Supplies For Various Classes: Paints, Brushes, Canvas, Paper, Easels, Chairs, Aprons, Painting Boards, Lighting Fixtures, and more so that I can fully implement the classes I've dreamt up and designed.  $3,000</li></ul>
<ul><li>Art Materials for Art Therapy Classes: Enough materials to be able to stock up so I can provide these classes free of charge to those who can benefit from them. $4,300</li></ul>
<ul><li>Signage: Right now from the street our gallery looks like a black box. I need to spruce up the outside to help get local residents in this community aware of the gallery inside and invite them to take part in it! How else will they find me? $900</li></ul>
<ul><li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Web design and upkeep: I need to enhance our online presence by revamping our website and making sure that people like you can connect and find me! $2,000</span></li></ul>
<ul><li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Printed promotional material: I need cards, class information etc. so that when I meet the people who could benefit from a class, a rental, a space to show their work, I can empower them with knowledge. $650</span></li></ul>
<ul><li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">General backing (rent, power): I'm a one man show here, and it's going to take a LOT of my time to get these classes and rental capabilities in place, so I will need help making sure the space is running on all cylinders for a couple of months while I put my ideas into action. $6,000</span></li></ul>
<ul><li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Marketing/PR: We all know that having this great space and these classes won't do any good if the people who want/need it can't find me! Getting the word out to artists, special needs children/adults, and others looking for their creative outlet is key and I'm going to need a specialist to help me do this. $4,000</span></li></ul>
<ul><li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A percentage of the money raised goes back to IndieGoGo and PayPal $1,500</span></li></ul>
<ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">And a percentage goes back into providing the Perks + Shipping the Perks to all you amazing people!  $2,650 (This monetary amount doesn't include the time it will take to produce all the perks)</span></li>

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul>
<li>Funding the classes for the gallery will allow autistic, blind, and special needs students to unlock and explore the creative sides of their brain and let them function on a different plane with me.</li>

<li>This gallery will allow me to continue inspiring people through my passion and help them connect to themselves and others through art.</li> <li>This gallery is the end of my journey as a business man and artist.

<div><br/></div>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>One of the biggest challenges I currently face is getting the word out about the gallery and connecting to the people who want what we have to offer. I've always come through on all my ideas and plans over the years, now I just need some help getting the funding to bring in the right people to get this place on the map!</p>
<p>I need a strategic plan to connect with these artists and students in order to best utilize the space and make all my ideas for expansion a reality.  My expertise and passion lie in creating, teaching, and making art- so I really need help bringing on an experienced PR or marketing firm to help propel the expansion  and get us moving toward my big dreams.</p>

<p><b>What we need
and how it will be spent: </b></p>
<p>We need paint and brushes for 75 USD to start the
first day of painting (800 rand) and if I just see that some funding is
starting to come in I can lend the money to buy paint for the project (since
the funding money will be paid out much later). <br/><br/><br/>
That 75 USD does not include spray paint, and since that is Pastelheart’s “thing”
and kids love spray painting we might buy that too bringing the price up a bit.
</p>
<p><br/>

<p></p></div>","This is not just about painting a wall painting on a daycare center, this is about inspiring and expanding the minds of township children through meetings with artists with bigger dreams and visions. 
Artists
who want to join the kids when we have money to buy paint:Pastel heart:Street artist. http://pastelheartist.blogspot.com SPOOK: Mural, street and tattoo artist.Rabbit Mahlatsi:Cartoon artist and graphic designer.  http://themahlatsicreations.blogspot.com Natasha
Jacobs:
Student of fine art at Durban University of Technology. 
She also wants to help with mural organization and other things for the kids. 
Please share the link and help us join the artists to paint with the children.More info?If you want a longer more detailed text about this project please scroll down. We just put it further down to not let the long text discourage anyone.Encouraged mural themesEveryone will paint whatever they want and we will try to inspire motives that have to do with friendship, helping people, freedom, health, sustainability, nature, motivation, equality, antiracism, fruits and greens, Ngilonde of course, and improving lives, local society and the world. Some photos of the kids at Ngilonde: http://www.worldimproving.org/ngilondephotos Filming the art initiative for DOTVA new online TV channel called Durban Online TV channel will most likely make a program from some of the painting sessions as well, which the children will definitely think is very fun, since very few of them even has a camera in their family. https://www.facebook.com/DurbanOnlineTV 

What we need
and how it will be spent: 
We need paint and brushes for 75 USD to start the
first day of painting (800 rand) and if I just see that some funding is
starting to come in I can lend the money to buy paint for the project (since
the funding money will be paid out much later). 
That 75 USD does not include spray paint, and since that is Pastelheart’s “thing”
and kids love spray painting we might buy that too bringing the price up a bit.


The rest of the 500 USD will be used for even more painting days until we are
out of paint. We have a huge wall to cover. 
Today there is not even a sign on the wall. 
There is not even a Ngilonde sign on the walls ,due to lack of funding at the
daycare center. Our first plan is to start by painting information about what Ngilonde does for the

About NgilondeThe Zulu word Ngilonde has some different translations, one of which is ""take care"".
Ngilonde is a daycare center that assists local orphans and vulnerable children
from the Chesterville community in Durban through offering care, free lunch, meals and help with homework,they give the opportunity for children to play sports and games thus giving them inspiration for life.Most of the children at Ngilonde can't  afford
shoes to play, so they play in their school shoes, but this doesnt stop them because they are usually
full of life and optimism!
Due to their lack of money and parents (most live with
poor grandparents or relatives) they have the same daily routine almost every
day and can rarely afford to leave the township (poor suburb) that they live
in. 
To get more variation and inspiration in the kids’
lives we have introduced skateboarding, basketball, fruit picnics and fruit
planting to the kids, and now we want to introduce painting! Any nice people who would like to paint or offer some other fun activities to the kids are more than welcome to contact us.

<h4>PICTURE THIS:</h4>
<p>An event that represents various fields - <b>art, architecture, photography, culinary, film, literature, music, performance, fashion</b>...all with <b>one</b> common thread.</p>
<p>The common thread is a conversation that we can all engage in, and subsequently, be exposed to disciplines we've always wanted to explore.</p>
<p>This begins in our new exhibition space on Commercial Street, and we're partnering with our 
neighbors to stimulate the San Francisco art scene.<br/></p>

<h4>SO WHO ARE WE?<br/>
</h4>We’re ELL | San Francisco, an arts collective,
formed from local artists, designers, performers, fabricators, architects,
curators, and alike. We're creating the next art and architecture movement in San Francisco, by developing a <b>Cross-Disciplinary</b> <b>Gallery + Exhibition + Meeting Space</b> for the arts and local business.  <br/><br/>In effort of supporting emerging artists, and pushing the limits of exhibition, we've united local business and the arts community. We’ve designed this space to flex from a conference
 room, to a more communal event area, allowing additional revenue to fund the creation of rigorous work. The goal is to foster creativity in all forms, 
from and, more uniquely,<i> for</i> those in all statures of life. <br/><br/><h4><b>THE TEAM:</b></h4>Jason Campbell - architecture and photography<br/>Rafael Vizcaino - culinary<br/>Tajai Massey - music<br/>Francisco Fernández - film<br/>Hana Bittner - mixed media<br/>Sam Holtzman - writing<br/>Peter Suen - emerging technologies<br/>Andrew Manuel - fashion<br/><h4><br/></h4>
<h4>WHY?</h4>When we talk about the arts, we find common ground in our need for more...<b>more creatives,
more discussion, more exhibition, and more space to create and facilitate
societies encounter with rigorous work.</b> 
<br/>The thing is: art and design need to position themselves in our
communities. We need to demonstrate that they are <b>valuable and accessible</b>, and
that our field is not exclusive; it simply takes the right lens to translate,
comprehend, and respond to current events. 
We need to demonstrate consistency, the continual reveal of the latest,
the most inspiring, the experimental, the refined, the bad ass, the challenging,
paired with the finesse that proves you're serious about creative endeavors.
<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>GET INVOLVED!<br/>
</h4>
<p>We've taken a 720sf storefront on Commercial Street, and aim to transform this space into a refined canvas for<b> the rigorous work of our arts community.  </b><br/></p>
<p>To properly outfit our space, we need <b>$50,000</b> to:</p>

<li>jump start our arts program<br/>
</li>
<li>create a fund to support emerging artist exhibitions<br/>

moved in on Commercial Street in 2015 with the newly founded, Chapel Hill Coffee.<span>  <b>This district has a strong mix of
restaurants, shops, galleries, and is home to several design-centric

of Chinatown heritage to the west. The south side has the hustle of financial
district, and Market Street, the only other San Francisco street with a perfect
view of the Ferry Terminal Tower.  If we’re not in view, just look for Transamerica

<h4>OUR CHALLENGE<br/>

Our primary challenge is the
fluctuating spatial needs and requirements for a diverse set of businesses,
social networks, and artists.  Given our diverse team's ability to solve complex situations, the flexibility of our space plan and design features, access

<h3>What is The Free Artists Network and How Does It Work?</h3>
<p>The Free Artists Network (FAN) is designed to modernize the field of art education, making art lessons more relevant to industry-standard skills and making content easier to access for a broader range of students worldwide.<br/><br/>The website will allow art educators from numerous domains—including Design, Fine Art, Film, Music, and Literature—to easily setup customized webpages for their art courses. The site will include easy-to-use online tools that will help art teachers setup and organize their art courses and art-based lessons through a digital format. Lessons can be streamed to students through live video or audio feeds, automatically recorded, and stored in an archive for students to view later. Teachers can also upload their own video lessons, podcasts, written tutorials, and other accompanying lesson materials to each online lesson. <br/><br/>All courses and individual lessons will be made available to students worldwide through an online database that students can use to search for art lessons and full courses that match their artistic interests, ability levels, and learning needs. Educators can make their art courses and lessons available to students for free or for a fee for the teacher. Students can choose to complete recorded lessons on their own, or they can opt to join live streaming lessons from educators with a teacher-student chatroom if they feel they need more direct support from an art teacher. Other art educators can use this database to find new lessons to share with their students or to use as a resource to better teach their students across a broad range of interests and needs. <br/><br/>Creative studios, industry professionals, and software developers can also use the website’s tools to create and contribute their own lessons to the online database to help students, new studio hires, and career artists learn industry-relevant skills and stay up-to-date with new versions of creative software. <br/><br/>Finally, students who enroll on the site will be provided with an easy-to-setup, customizable portfolio webpage where they can showcase all their work from cumulative lessons. When students graduate, they will have a personalized, online portfolio to show to colleges or clients.</p>

<p><strong>Art Teachers</strong><br/><br/>FAN offers art educators easy-to-use, free tools that allow them to setup and organize personalized, professional webpages for their art courses. Course and lesson templates are offered in a digital format that allows art teachers to easily organize information and other materials related to each lesson, including videos, podcasts, written tutorials, downloadable files, links, discussion topics, online quizzes, class chatrooms, project information, assignment directions, rubrics, state content standards (if applicable), and albums for files and artwork submitted by students. All artwork and artistic media submitted to teachers by students will automatically display on the front end of the teacher’s course page in a shared gallery of student work so that educators can share their students’ work with others. <br/><br/>Teachers can stream their video or audio lessons in live time, or they can privately record their lessons for students to access later. Once setup, each individual lesson can be accessed and independently completed by students enrolled in that teacher’s course, or if it is a public lesson, by students and other art educators who can locate the lesson by searching for it in the public database of art lessons. Teachers can share their lessons with other art educators and can locate art lessons from other teachers to share with their students. Teachers can make their lessons publicly available for free or they can charge a fee for each lesson.<br/><br/><strong>Art Students</strong><br/><br/>Art students from various backgrounds—including Design, Film, Music, Fine Art, and Literature—will be able to freely search for individual art lessons and full courses that best meet their particular interests in artistic styles and their ability levels. Lessons will be contributed by trained art educators, industry professionals, and studios, providing students with both the educational supports they need and the modern content most relevant to the rapidly changing industry they desire. Students will also be provided with easy-to-setup, personalized, professional-looking online portfolios to promote their work to colleges and clients.<br/><br/><strong>Special Needs and ESL Students</strong><br/><br/>Studies have shown that students with English language struggles and other special learning considerations do well with a greater amount of educational options and differentiated instruction. Students will have the option of selecting lessons that suit their ability level and that deliver content using the type of media they most prefer to learn in, such as video lessons, audio podcasts, and written tutorials—or a mixture of these. Video lessons can be particularly beneficial to students with learning difficulties and students who are not yet proficient in English, as the content is delivered through a more visual modality. Such lessons can be rewound for students struggling with attention control or memory.<br/><br/><strong>Career Artists</strong><br/><br/>In the constantly and rapidly changing field of art, one never stops being a student. It takes regular learning to stay ahead of the curve and to be consistently up-to-date with industry trends and the newest versions of creative software. Rather than having to go back to school or to rely on their employers for this training, career artists can use the Free Artists Network to take control of their own education and to provide themselves with the necessary training resources to remain “hire-able” in the advancing industry. Artists can also utilize the lessons and courses they find through FAN to reinvent themselves and their styles at any time in their careers.<br/><br/><strong>Studios</strong><br/><br/>Wish all the new artistic talents that you hire were already fully trained in the systems and software your studio utilizes? Many studios often have to donate time, effort, and finances to on-the-job training for their new artistic talents, particularly those who are recent graduates. FAN’s database of searchable art lessons serves as a training resource that new hires can use to independently prepare themselves for work at any particular studio. This is also useful for experienced creative talent in the event that the studio they are employed for must suddenly change their processes or switch to a newer version of software. Studios need only direct their creative employees to lessons or full courses on the Free Artists Network without having to spend any time or effort to personally train these individuals. <br/><br/>Studios can also contribute their own recorded media lessons to the database of courses to store for all their future hires. Because they are allowed to contribute art lessons to the database, studios and other industry professionals are able to donate their knowledge and expertise of industry skills to art educators and art students, thus providing the field of art education with more industry-relevant lessons. <br/><br/></p>

Every $2 That We Receive Builds a Course Website for One Art Teacher ( Including YOU )

We service educators in the Fine Arts, Design, Film, Performing Arts, Music, and Literature.
 
Update: NEW Rewards for Donors!
 

 

Why Should I Support the FAN Project?

Problem 1: Cuts to Education Have Left Arts-Based Programs Particularly Wounded, Leaving Many Students Without Any Education in the Arts

 
Problem 2: Students Are Not Being Prepared for the New ""Creative Economy""
Cuts to arts-based education are happening at the same time that job rates in the creative sectors are seeing the largest numbers of growth than in any other sectors during the economic rebound. Job openings in the creative sectors grew by over 60% in just this year alone.

<p>First, a little bit about our school and program! The University of the Arts is one of America’s oldest universities devoted to the arts. It is located right in downtown Philadelphia, in Center City on the Avenue of the Arts. The MFA Book Arts/Printmaking Program is a two-year program in studio arts, focusing on the book as a vehicle of artistic expression and printmaking in the context of the narrative.</p>
<p>This trip will provide many amazing opportunities for students. Foremost, we will be participating as vendors at the Seoul International Artists’ Book Fair, as part of the Seoul International Book Fair. Immediately after tabling at the Fair we will be hanging a short show of prints at a nearby gallery associated with Hongik University. Later we will mount an exhibition of artists books at the Korean National University of the Arts.</p>
<p>In our free time we will also be visiting various galleries, museums, professional artists’ studios and other important cultural sites around Seoul. There will also be a tour of a nearby paper mill to learn about traditional Korean papermaking.</p>
<p>This trip is of <em>enormous</em> importance to all of our development as professional artists. Not only will we be participating in the Seoul International Book Art Fair as vendors and attendants but we will also be exhibiting work internationally. For many of us this will be our <em>first</em> experience in an international artistic forum, our <em>first</em> international gallery opportunity, our <em>first</em> time to any Asian country, and even the <em>first</em> time out of our own country period. It is almost impossible to begin to estimate the total educational and social value of this phenomenal opportunity.</p>
<p>Here's a quick break downs of costs for the whole trip for each person.</p>
<ul>
<li>$1700 plane ticket</li>
<li>$800 housing costs</li>
<li>$300 transportation costs</li>
<li>$200 museum and gallery costs</li>
</ul><p>That means that for each of the ten participants costs come to around <strong>$3000</strong>. This fundraising campaign is an attempt to lower total costs for the entire group.</p>
<p>We thank you for your interest and continued support, we hope that you choose to donate to this campaign and help us in our travels as professional artists.</p>
<p><strong>**IMPORTANT</strong> <strong>NOTICE!</strong> Many of our perks offered are in limited editions. These limited editions will be purchased first come, first served. If you are interested in purchasing a limited edition item please respond to the confirmation email you receive IMMEDIATELY to secure it. If you have bid on a item whose limit has been reached we will contact you via email and either suggest another item or refund your money.</p>
<p><strong>**Mailing Dates!</strong> All perks will be mailed no later than June 15th. You will be notified via email when your perk has been mailed. The only exceptions being the postcards and letters to be mailed from Korea and the ""Korea Snapshot"" to be designed and mailed after the trip.</p></div>","Hi there!

In our free time we will also be visiting various galleries, museums, professional artists’ studios and other important cultural sites around Seoul. There will also be a tour of a nearby paper mill to learn about traditional Korean papermaking.
This trip is of enormous importance to all of our development as professional artists. Not only will we be participating in the Seoul International Book Art Fair as vendors and attendants but we will also be exhibiting work internationally. For many of us this will be our first experience in an international artistic forum, our first international gallery opportunity, our first time to any Asian country, and even the first time out of our own country period. It is almost impossible to begin to estimate the total educational and social value of this phenomenal opportunity.
Here's a quick break downs of costs for the whole trip for each person.

$1700 plane ticket
$800 housing costs
$300 transportation costs
$200 museum and gallery costs
That means that for each of the ten participants costs come to around $3000. This fundraising campaign is an attempt to lower total costs for the entire group.
We thank you for your interest and continued support, we hope that you choose to donate to this campaign and help us in our travels as professional artists.
**IMPORTANT NOTICE! Many of our perks offered are in limited editions. These limited editions will be purchased first come, first served. If you are interested in purchasing a limited edition item please respond to the confirmation email you receive IMMEDIATELY to secure it.

</p><p>In any restaurant, the family or staff meal is the pre-service dinner where all members of the staff sit down together and enjoy just before the restaurant's doors open for dinner. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferran_Adri%C3%A0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chef Ferran Adria</a>, of the world famous <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElBulli"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">El Bulli</a>, stated, “To cook well, you must eat well.” Even in our school, our students do not eat well.

<p></p>
<p>The idea of this project is based on ‘The Family Meal,’ when all restaurant employees sit down with one another and share a good meal before service.

<p>Our student population lives below the poverty line. More that 70 percent of my students receive free and reduced lunch.

organic and synthetic tissue constructing beastly vessels for the embodiment of
these celestial personalities.</p><p></p><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/246828/files/20131206200407-Ban_aries.jpg?1386389047"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">Why do I need your help?</span></p><p>This kickstarter is to fund the launch of Zodion Graphics. I am just about to graduate college and need a little help getting up on my feet! The money will go towards the following:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>Advertising/Promotion for Zodion</li>
<li>Maintaining websites &amp; The Store</li>
<li>Ordering products featuring the illustrations - stickers, magnets, prints, accessories, etc</li>
</ul><p>Advertising costs are based on exposure, for example I can buy an ad for $20 that gets 10,000 views. That sounds like a lot, but a view counts as it having loading on a page, not an actual click on the ad. Because I am such a new, unknown business I will need to buy several ads on many different websites and that will run up my costs quickly, especially if I want to renew any advertisements.</p><p>It costs $200 annually to maintain a website that supports a in-built store. Store hosting websites such as etsy.com and storeenvy.com have listing fees per item, which means I have to pay money to even show my item for sale in my store.</p><p>Minimum orders of custom designed products are often 50+ items and I would love to offer a variety of products, meaning that I have to place orders that costs a little bit more than if I were to order a huge bulk of one item. I also have 13 separate designs meaning that I have to make a lot of little orders. For example when I was ordering the bookmarks I'm offering as perks, I had to place 12 separate orders of 25 bookmarks each, costing me $77 versus ordering 500 bookmarks of a single design for $25! </p><p>This business is all about offering variety and, unfortunately, that means investing a lot more initially than if I were offering only one product.</p><p>Be a part of the launch and receive the FIRST editions of these products and also the undying gratefulness of an artist jumping feet first into the business world! </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/231722/files/20131129144923-Ban_Libra.jpg?1385765363"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3 style=""text-align: center; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);""><a href=""https://zodion.squarespace.com/gallery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""color: rgb(33, 146, 158);"" target=""_blank"">See the Illustrations!</a></h3><p></p><p></p><h3>Shipping for Christmas &amp; Internationally</h3>I will do my absolute best to get all the products out for Christmas, it will be easier for me the sooner you donate.

misunderstood concept. The Zodiac is common knowledge but ridiculed for being
too fantastical, especially for the new values of the modern world. Zodion
proposes a new futuristic take on the Zodiac; converting all the characters to
genderless beasts in order to reduce any sense of bias or stereotyping between
each character. Each character is a bionic hybrid of organic and synthetic
tissues, making them ageless and in line with the trend of scientific developments
of today’s society.</span><br/></p>
<p>The illustrations are designed to be subtle embodiments of
the Zodiac signs, allowing the art itself to be the most important thing. The
Zodiac elements are supposed to be read second, even third and fourth. The
attempt to shed the previous notions and misconceptions about the Zodiac is
only possible if the viewer does not see the Zodiac first; but instead is
grabbed by the artwork and allowed to make their own ideas. The lack of
explicit labeling also means that the viewer can feel free to own images that
are not of their own sign, but of whatever character, or characters, they enjoy
the most.</p><br/><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/231724/files/20131129144955-Ban_sag.jpg?1385765395"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p></p><h3>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em;"">About the Artist</span><br/>
</h3><p>Tori Meader is a young, somewhat overly enthusiastic,
illustrator who loves designing and creating creatures and characters. She
crafted Zodion from her love of not only the Zodiac, but of the mystical nature
of ancient practices. Inspired by what she imagines must have been a life of
fearful mystery and hopeful awe, she struck out to replicate these feelings in

<p></p></div>","Announcements - Postcard images are now in the galleryWith only a week left, I'm going to throw in a batch of stickers with every perk!What is Zodion?Zodion is a line of illustrations by Tori Meader which
reimagines the characters of the Western Zodiac as bionic creatures; a mesh of
organic and synthetic tissue constructing beastly vessels for the embodiment of
these celestial personalities.Why do I need your help?This kickstarter is to fund the launch of Zodion Graphics. I am just about to graduate college and need a little help getting up on my feet! The money will go towards the following:
Advertising/Promotion for Zodion
Maintaining websites & The Store
Ordering products featuring the illustrations - stickers, magnets, prints, accessories, etc
Advertising costs are based on exposure, for example I can buy an ad for $20 that gets 10,000 views. That sounds like a lot, but a view counts as it having loading on a page, not an actual click on the ad. Because I am such a new, unknown business I will need to buy several ads on many different websites and that will run up my costs quickly, especially if I want to renew any advertisements.It costs $200 annually to maintain a website that supports a in-built store. Store hosting websites such as etsy.com and storeenvy.com have listing fees per item, which means I have to pay money to even show my item for sale in my store.Minimum orders of custom designed products are often 50+ items and I would love to offer a variety of products, meaning that I have to place orders that costs a little bit more than if I were to order a huge bulk of one item. I also have 13 separate designs meaning that I have to make a lot of little orders. For example when I was ordering the bookmarks I'm offering as perks, I had to place 12 separate orders of 25 bookmarks each, costing me $77 versus ordering 500 bookmarks of a single design for $25! This business is all about offering variety and, unfortunately, that means investing a lot more initially than if I were offering only one product.Be a part of the launch and receive the FIRST editions of these products and also the undying gratefulness of an artist jumping feet first into the business world! See the Illustrations!Shipping for Christmas & InternationallyI will do my absolute best to get all the products out for Christmas, it will be easier for me the sooner you donate. Shipping is free but not guaranteed delivery in time, if you really, really want your perk reward in time for Christmas, please contact me and we can figure it all out!I WILL ship internationally, but they won't be out before Christmas, unfortunately.I will  be receiving the products I have available for the perks on roughly Dec 10th.More About ZodionZodion is about changing the perception of this
misunderstood concept. The Zodiac is common knowledge but ridiculed for being
too fantastical, especially for the new values of the modern world. Zodion
proposes a new futuristic take on the Zodiac; converting all the characters to
genderless beasts in order to reduce any sense of bias or stereotyping between
each character. Each character is a bionic hybrid of organic and synthetic
tissues, making them ageless and in line with the trend of scientific developments
of today’s society.
The illustrations are designed to be subtle embodiments of
the Zodiac signs, allowing the art itself to be the most important thing. The
Zodiac elements are supposed to be read second, even third and fourth. The
attempt to shed the previous notions and misconceptions about the Zodiac is
only possible if the viewer does not see the Zodiac first; but instead is
grabbed by the artwork and allowed to make their own ideas. The lack of
explicit labeling also means that the viewer can feel free to own images that
are not of their own sign, but of whatever character, or characters, they enjoy
the most.
About the Artist
Tori Meader is a young, somewhat overly enthusiastic,
illustrator who loves designing and creating creatures and characters. She
crafted Zodion from her love of not only the Zodiac, but of the mystical nature
of ancient practices. Inspired by what she imagines must have been a life of
fearful mystery and hopeful awe, she struck out to replicate these feelings in
her work; to share the magic of believable fantasy.Thank You, Thank You, Thank YouYou are the absolute best!

<p>I’m Jerrod Jordahl, an artist living and working in Des Moines, and I need your help.  In September 2014, I received state funding from the Iowa Arts Council, a division of the Iowa Department of Cultural Affairs, to support the production of my original theatrical work, <i>Pointland: A Play for Audio</i>.  My team and I successfully completed the casting, recording, scoring, and mastering of the play, but we need your financial support in the final stage of this project.  </p>
<p><i>Pointland </i>is play in two acts: we follow an unnamed recluse and his personal staff in the days leading up to their mysterious departure from his family estate. </p>
<p><span>The audio recording of <i>Pointland </i>will be released this summer on vinyl record, complete with an original soundtrack, in partnership with Maximum Ames Records.  Collaboration with other Iowa artists was a major focus of the project for me.  I wanted to share my artistic vision with a discerning audience while showcasing local talent.  In an effort to further increase the impact of this project on the arts in Iowa, all the proceeds from the sale of the vinyl record will be donated to RunDSM, a Des Moines Public Schools program that uses performance-based art to support and empower students on their journey to becoming community-based activists. </span></p>
<p>The entire process has been so rewarding: our auditions yielded an outstanding cast of ten actors who gave voice to my characters; three musicians composed and performed original songs for the soundtrack; our very patient and gifted sound engineer put all the pieces together; and a visual artist created stunning and starling images for the record album cover and liner notes.  Your dollars ensure that we can fulfill our commitment to the Iowa artists who brought this play to life.</p>
<p>I’m asking for your help in raising the final $2,500 necessary to complete this project.  Make a donation and you’ll receive a “perk” AKA  a cool gift specific to the production of the play -- check out the giving levels and the associated perks along the right of this web page.

<p>We are BA(Hons) Fine Art for Design soon-to-be graduates at Batley School of Art, raising funds to take our degree show down to London (Free Range 2017).</p>
<p>We’ve spent the last three years in our little corner of Yorkshire, quietly working away on our art, design, sculpture, illustration, animation, photography and film and now that we’re all fully cooked it’s time to take it out into the world.</p>
<p>To date, we’ve held bake sales, set up shops, put on exhibitions and generally wheeled and dealed our way into raising money for Free Range. This is just the last push we need to cover our venue costs and promotional material.</p>
<p>BA(Hons) Fine Art for Design have exhibited at Free Range for over 14 successive years and the feedback from industry professionals, creatives and the public has been overwhelming. We believe this is an invaluable opportunity to kickstart our creative careers.</p>
<p>Aside from donating to our project – which we are very thankful for! Sharing this campaign with your friends would be a massive help in order to help us achieve something we have thought about since the first day of our degree in 2014. Thank you!</p>

<h3>The Design</h3>
<p>The glove design was hand drawn by queer hockey fan <a href=""twitter.com/HockeyBabbler"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">@HockeyBabbler</a> (that's me!) and colored to reflect various pride flags. The initial funding goal covered the traditional rainbow LGBTQIA+ pride flag. We blew past our original goal during the pre-order window and have z total of three designs available to choose from: The traditional rainbow, trans pride, and bi pride flag designs!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here is what you'll get for backing this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>High quality hard enamel pin with rubber back.</li>
<li>Free shipping to the US for up to three pins! Unfortunately once you get above three pins, the weight adds up, so we do have to charge a nominal amount for shipping. International customers, we've tried to keep the shipping costs low for you.</li>
<li>The warm, fuzzy feeling of supporting an independent artist!</li>
</ul>
<p>What your money goes towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cost of manufacturing a minimum of 100 of each pin design</li>
<li>Cards for mounting pins on</li>
<li>Fulfillment labor</li>
<li>Packaging materials</li>
<li>Postage</li>
<li>Indiegogo &amp; credit card processing fees</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is a passion project for me. It began as an idle desire for a pin to decorate my jacket and blossomed into something awesome. I am a freelance cartoonist and writer who is currently between full-time gigs, so your money also goes towards helping me keep my cats in cat food!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I'll be 100% upfront - I've never had pins made before and this is all a little daunting. But my chosen manufacturer comes recommended by artists who have used them before, and this is not my first fundraising campaign. As long as we reach the initial goal, I'll have enough money to manufacture and fulfill 50 pins. I've carefully considered my stretch goals to reflect the additional cost of manufacturing more than one design. From what I understand, order fulfillment is often the hardest part of these campaigns. If the campaign is extremely successful, I may outsource help for fulfillment, otherwise I have done lots of research into the expenses of making, selling, and shipping enamel pins and feel confident that I can handle this.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Timeline</h3>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>September:</strong> Campaign starts!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>October:</strong> Campaign ends! Surveys sent out to determine final count of each design, if multiple designs get made.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>November-December: </strong>Pins get manufactured and packages get assembled!</p></li>
<li><p><strong>January: </strong>Pins get shipped to you! Woohoo!</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't afford a pin right now, that's okay! But maybe you'd be willing to help share word about these pins throughout hockey fandom by sharing the campaign on social media? That would be swell! I also hope to have extra pins (if any) available for sale after the Indiegogo pre-sale, so keep an eye on my social media feeds for updates on that front.</p>

The Unseen Art project - a new way to experience art with touch, for the blind and for everyone. 

Have you ever been touched by art?  Have you had an emotional reaction while viewing a painting, have you gotten a different point of view, or learned something about the world or yourself?
Have you ever touched the work of a great artist?  Have you ever wanted to get up close and personal, and experience the art with your own hands?
You can experience art in a new way, and open art to others for the first time.  There are many people in the world who have heard of classical artworks their whole lives but are unable to see them. 
The project is involving people from all over the world to recreate classical art We are creating a new opportunity for people in the world to experience art.  The project is involving people from all over the world to recreate classical art paintings in 3D so that they may be touched and felt, both in exhibitions and in people's homes. 3D models of the paintings are free and printable anywhere in the world where there's access to a 3D printer.

""It would be a revolution to get blind people going to art galleries, people hate them because there is nothing there to touch!""








Your contribution will give people the opportunity to experience paintings for the first time in their lives. 
Many people around the world have heard of many classical artworks but never been able to see them.  Very few in the world have ever touched any of them. 
If you love art, supporting the campaign will give you a beautiful rendition of a masterpiece of art you can touch, experience different light and shadows, and display as a unique part of a home or office.
If you love technology or 3D, backing the campaign will help push the technology and awareness higher, and give new opportunities for virtual 3D art to become tactile, concrete, and physical.
If you know or love a blind or visually impaired person, you can give them a piece of art to experience for the first time, and make it more accessible for everyone around the world.
If you work in an office or own a business, a striking and unique artwork can impress and show philanthropy to your customers and partners.
A small contribution and a referral to your friends will make a great difference in people's lives.  
Anyone will be able to experience them for the first time through touch, and create their own impressions and opinions. Make a global impact together with us allows blind and visually impaired people and anyone interested in art  to personally experience the inspiration, education, and thought-provoking feelings that meaningful art creates.






Creating equal access for art globally is our passion and goal.
By backing our campaign we will be able to approach 3D artists to contribute their interpretations of 3D art, and anyone in the world can download them for free and print them anywhere there is a 3D printer, such as many libraries, Universities, in their homes, or from a local business.

We cannot do it without you!
Backing this campaign will help at any level.  All perks will be sent out regardless of the amount raised.  We believe in creating connections of people and making the world's art freely available.

<h3>Your funds will turn potties into interactive deep playa art</h3>
<p>The ARP exist.  We will use your funds to make them aesthetically worthy &amp; mechanically robust enough to work on the Playa.  We have already arranged for a bank of Deep Playa Porto's to convert. We have the funds for travel, prototyping &amp; to put 1 unit in place.  The supporting solar power infrastructure will cost $2,100. For each $1000 we raise we can augment another unit.  Our goal is 10, but all funds over our goal will become another augmented potty!</p>
<h3>What is a playa worthy ARP?</h3>
<p>First we will wrap them in matte white vinyl so they take on the austere flatness of the playa.   At night we will up light them using a warm white light.  From a distance they will appear to float on the surface of deep playa.</p>
<p>Each unit uses low resolution sonar sensors to measure the distance from door to anything occupying the space. These sensors are hidden and are not capable of producing imagery. With them we know if a unit is occupied and if the occupant is standing, sitting &amp; how long they have been in there. </p>
<p>Projection on the playa is tough and only works at night.  So we are converting the projection to scroll signs which will work day and night.  Each sign will have its own printed canvas with ten unique styles of imagery for indicating open, sitting &amp; standing.</p>

<h3>Your gift of money will become a gift of playa art</h3>
<p>The Other Singularity group has been creating and deploying activations world wide for a decade.  This will be our first playa project but not our first time on the playa.  We have activated at many other large festivals or events.  You can trust that we will convert your pledge into a working piece of art that you will be proud to have supported!</p>
<h3>There will be a life after burning man</h3>
<p>We will be bringing the electronics home and will be able to activate these at other events.  This is not a one and done that only burners will see. Your money will create multiple activations and help provoke many people into thinking about their relationship with technology.</p>
<h3>You are funding art, not our trip!</h3>
<p>We have tickets, we have our equipment, we have our travel covered. We are already prototyping the final build. Your funds will go to materials and every $1000 raised equals more Augmented Porta Potty's.  Scale will really help the impact of the activation.  We would like to do as large a row as possible!</p>
<h3>What is a Roll Blind Sign?</h3>
<p>Made famous by the London Busses &amp; NYC Subway these signs have a banner behind glass on two rollers.  By turning the rollers you can change the sign.  We are making our own custom large format version of this kind of sign.  We will be printing out the sings on a plotter allowing us cool high resolution graphics.  Here is a video of the prototype:</p>

<h3>The ARP at SXSW in 2011</h3>

<h3>Who we are: our story</h3>
<p>Anagoor è un progetto artistico che sceglie per le proprie creazioni il campo gravitazionale del teatro. Le forme assunte dalle opere sono le più diverse, eppure restano spiccatamente inerenti al teatro, lo provocano, ne testano i limiti. Un principio che precipita in diversi formati finali dove immagine, poesia, performing art, filosofia, musica e scena ipermediale entrano in dialogo, pretendendo tuttavia, in virtù della natura di quest’arte, di rimanere teatro. Ma soprattutto Anagoor è la storia di un gruppo. Nasce nel 2000 a Castelfranco Veneto. Dal 2010 fa parte dei progetti di curatela di Centrale Fies. Nel 2018 ha ricevuto il Leone d’Argento per l'innovazione teatrale alla Biennale di Venezia e nel 2020 compie vent’anni. Anagoor non riceve contributi pubblici.</p>

<h3>Who we are: our home</h3>
<p>Dal 2008 Anagoor ha preso a cuore le sorti di uno spazio, un ex allevamento di conigli, facendone il proprio atelier artistico: <strong>La Conigliera </strong>di Castelminio, in Veneto. Conservandone le caratteristiche architettoniche, Anagoor ha trasformato un incubatore cunicolo intensivo in culla delle arti contemporanee. Attività di scuola e laboratoriali, esposizioni ed eventi si tengono saltuariamente in alternanza ai periodi di creazione e di prove.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>La Conigliera è un centro di produzione delle arti performative e uno studio di posa che offre appoggio e residenza anche ad altri artisti e gruppi, aperto alla ricerca, alle residenze, alle attività di formazione e all'organizzazione di eventi privati. La Conigliera, struttura vitale<strong> </strong>per la produzione artistica di Anagoor, <strong>non riceve sostegni pubblici né sponsorizzazioni </strong>ed è interamente mantenuta grazie all'impegno della compagnia.</p>

<p>Per celebrare questi primi vent’anni di creazione (MM-MMXX) sono in cantiere un <strong>libro</strong>, un <strong>disco</strong>, un <strong>film-concerto</strong>, una <strong>retrospettiva</strong>: oggetti fisici ed eventi, opere d'arte dalla natura diversa che in piena crisi pandemica propongono un'idea di sopravvivenza del <strong>teatro in</strong> <strong>altra forma</strong>, ipotizzano modalità di salvataggio della memoria della più effimera tra le arti, concettualizzano il suo eterno mutare pelle, il suo permanere, il suo ripresentarsi. Contribuendo a questo crowdfunding parteciperai direttamente alla creazione di queste opere, all'incisione del doppio vinile, alla pubblicazione del saggio, alla produzione del film, alla realizzazione degli eventi live, alla <strong>preservazione della memoria</strong> della produzione artistica del gruppo, al <strong>sostegno della Conigliera</strong>. </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Il doppio album si presenta dunque come un archivio che raccoglie la memoria del teatro (arte notoriamente effimera e difficile da catturare), trovando per la performance dal vivo una nuova forma, il vinile, e per le composizioni musicali di Martinuz, che tanta parte hanno nelle creazioni di Anagoor, l'attenzione che meritano. La registrazione dal vivo della performance del <i>Secondo Libro</i> dell'<i>Eneide</i> tratta dallo spettacolo <i>Virgilio Brucia</i> ferma su disco un <strong>evento teatrale memorabile</strong> con Menegoni che recita, in uno dei teatri più importanti d’Italia, i più emozionanti versi virgiliani a perdifiato, <strong>in latino</strong> e in metrica, sull'incessante beat elettronico di Martinuz: in una lingua morta che non è mai stata così viva permane la memoria dell'incendio di Troia, dello sterminio di un popolo, della fuga per mare.</p>

<h3>2. A Book</h3>
<p>""<strong>UNA FESTA TRA NOI E I MORTI, <i>sull’</i>Orestea di Eschilo</strong>""<strong> </strong>è invece il titolo del <strong>libro</strong> di Simone Derai che sarà edito da Cronopio nel 2020. Con questa pubblicazione si intende rendere conto del lavoro drammaturgico e di traduzione compiuto sulla trilogia di Eschilo messa in scena da Anagoor nel 2018. <i>Orestea / Agamennone, Schiavi, Conversio</i>, che ha inaugurato il 46° Festival internazionale del Teatro della Biennale di Venezia, è un lavoro teatrale che si dichiara fin dal titolo <i>sull’</i>Orestea di Eschilo. Non una riduzione del testo originale, né un trattamento della vicenda, ma un confronto con l’opera che estende il dominio del teatro ai campi anti-teatrali della performance e della critica. Il libro racconta, spalancandoli e non nascondendoli, i problemi di traduzione, non solo linguistica, e di <strong>rappresentazione della tragedia</strong> oggi.</p>
<p> </p>
<div><div style=""text-align: center;""><div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/341123466?portrait=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p style=""text-align: left;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Cosa significa recarsi a cospetto dell'opera di Eschilo? Come fare i conti con la sua materia drammatica e, in primo luogo, verbale senza scegliere le scorciatoie dell'attualizzazione? Come affrontare la scalata a quell’impalcatura bifida che sorregge i due discorsi, paralleli e intrecciati come i serpenti del caduceo, sulla giustizia e sull’essere? Attraverso la lettura ontologica dell’<i>Orestea</i>, debitrice della lezione imprescindibile di Emanuele Severino, scomparso proprio quest'anno, si delinea anche un’idea del tragico imprevista: anziché stabilire una volta per tutte l’ineluttabilità e l’insolubilità dei conflitti, Eschilo pare invocare un superamento della contesa per mezzo di una sospensione dell’agire. La ribellione sta nel rifiutare l'accanimento.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">L’<i>Orestea</i> di Anagoor non rincorre solo Eschilo, ma anche Socrate, Broch, Severino, Givone, l’amato Sebald, la Harendt, Mazzoni: una muta di Virgilii apripista per scendere a ritroso nel tempo, <i>fin dentro la sera, fin dentro la notte</i>, lungo la schiena dell’Occidente, e risalire poi il sentiero che dal bacino del Mediterraneo attraversa le foreste europee, all’inseguimento delle tracce che portano ai rituali funebri, all’origine del teatro, alle ossessioni e ai deliri del continente, alle fosse comuni.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">La pubblicazione del testo completo dell’<i>Agamennone</i> di Anagoor, tradotto da Simone Derai e Patrizia Vercesi, offre l’occasione per narrare questo viaggio che si dipana in due altri capitoli scenici sorti dal confronto con l’opera di Eschilo: <i>Schiavi</i>, che ancora conserva lacerti di <i>Coefore</i>, e <i>Conversio</i> che pur abbandonando la parola di Eschilo, riafferma per la parola, proprio in virtù di questo abbandono, una disperata potenza di <strong>salvezza da ogni incendio</strong>. Il libro contiene <strong>Con i cani e con la rete</strong>, <i>note sulla traduzione e indagini testuali</i>, importante saggio di Susanna Pietrosanti.</p>

<h3>3. A Concert-film</h3>
<p>""<strong>MEPHISTOPHELES eine Grand Tour</strong>"" è il titolo di un film concerto, attualmente in fase di produzione, che al suo debutto sarà uno dei primi eventi dal vivo dopo la riapertura del Paese: il prossimo 2 luglio, infatti, la proiezione concerto aprirà il Napoli Teatro Festival Italia, all'interno del Cortile d'Onore di Palazzo Reale. Poi sarà presentato a Centrale Fies, all'Operaestate Festival Veneto di Bassano del Grappa, al KunstFest di Weimar in Germania in settembre e poi ancora al Museo MADRE di Napoli e al Fit Festival di Lugano in Svizzera. </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590925316/f0qscvpelrxbwh7czbx0.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Questo <strong>concerto per immagini</strong> era in cantiere fin da prima della pandemia e ora ci appare come un'opera profetica per temi (la malattia, la morte, le case di riposo, lo sfruttamento intensivo degli animali, il senso che abbiamo del sacro...) e per forma, nel suo presentarsi come teatro senza attori, spettacolo dal vivo ed epifania del corpo, ma <strong>in assenza dei corpi</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590787708/lm9ehifzij8dvc7yohry.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>«<i>Tutto questo e varie altre circostanze concomitanti mi spingono e mi costringono a smarrirmi in regioni del mondo ove nessuno mi conosca. Parto solo, sotto nome incognito, e da quest'impresa apparentemente stravagante mi riprometto il meglio possibile.</i><i>»</i></p>
<p>Così Goethe in una lettera al duca Karl August del 2 settembre 1786 annuncia il suo <i>Grand Tour</i>; partirà da Karlsbad il giorno seguente, verso le 3 del mattino, munito di un passaporto falso che recava il nome di Philipp Möller. Sotto il nome del demone bugiardo che tentò Faust, <i>Mephistopheles </i>(il <i>dispensatore-di-menzogne)</i>, Anagoor raduna il materiale video raccolto in vent'anni in un grande viaggio per immagini attraverso le lacrime del mondo, <strong>musicato in un live set elettronico da Mauro Martinuz</strong>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590786669/vxtuxuqoet1dzju4up6h.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Mephistopheles</i> (<i>colui-che-ha-in-odio-la-luce)</i> è un <i>Grand Tour</i> nelle zone buie del cosmo, lì dove scaturiscono insieme la tenebra e le sofferenze delle generazioni, il rapporto dell’uomo con la natura, con l’eros, con i compagni animali, con il tempo e con la tecnica, con l’assoluto: l’impossibile. La materia cinematografica di spettacoli teatrali come <i>Lingua Imperii</i>, <i>Virgilio Brucia</i>, <i>Socrate il sopravvissuto</i>, <i>Faust</i>, <i>Orestea</i> è composta da immagini raccolte nei musei e nei templi, nelle case di cura per anziani e negli allevamenti intensivi, tra macellai, pastori e pellegrini, in India, in Iran, ad Olimpia, sulla ferita campagna veneta e sul Vesuvio. L’enorme quantità di materiale inedito trova nuova composizione in questo volo e caduta in forma di concerto <i>cum figuris</i>.</p>

<h3>4. A Series of Live Events</h3>
<p>""<strong>MMXX</strong>"" è anche il titolo di una serie di eventi live con cui culmineranno le celebrazioni per il ventennale della compagnia. La casa-atelier di Anagoor, la Conigliera di Castelminio, sarà aperta per tutto il mese di settembre: spettacoli, installazioni, videoproiezioni, concerti, live set, conferenze ed incontri con il pubblico si alterneranno tra la fine dell'estate e l'autunno 2020. Non solo una retrospettiva, ma anche un programma che si arricchirà di performance di amici artisti. Il programma è in corso di elaborazione e sarà soggetto alle disposizioni sanitarie.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>FUNDS ALLOCATION</h3>
<h3>What we need: the complete budget</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Un progetto così articolato, la produzione di opere così diversificate hanno costi non indifferenti. Anagoor ha già provveduto a stringere virtuosa alleanza con diversi partner e i costi più ingenti sono già coperti. Quello che manca alla completa realizzazione del progetto, tuttavia, ha bisogno del tuo prezioso contributo. Il crowdfunding mira a colmare i costi non ancora coperti. Qui di seguito indichiamo i costi dell'intero progetto, illustrando quanto già raccolto, quanto manca alla copertura totale, i tempi di realizzazione, gli interventi vitali per la buona riuscita.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590820075/pwu5svx3xwu1magamtnx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590848789/zo0xwvdsq8rw4pdzlvmv.jpg"" src=""""/></h3>
<h3>What we need: what is already funded</h3>
<p><strong>PRODUZIONE MEPHISTOPHELES</strong>. La produzione del film-concerto è la parte economicamente più consistente dell'intero progetto, ma a differenza delle altre iniziative e creazioni ha già in gran parte una copertura produttiva a cui partecipano il Napoli Teatro Festival Italia, Centrale Fies, il Museo Madre di Napoli, Operaestate Festival, il KunstFest Weimar, il Theater an der Ruhr di Mülheim an der Ruhr.  Il budget copre le spese di personale e realizzazione, il noleggio di materiale video e costi di ripresa, i permessi e le autorizzazioni per filmare, direzione della fotografia, montaggio video, studio di registrazione, viaggi e residenza, acquisto materiale audio, direzione tecnica, e altri costi tecnici relativi alla produzione dell'evento dal vivo. Quello che manca ancora sono le risorse per le riprese aeree che dovevano essere effettuate ad aprile sopra il cratere del Vesuvio e che sono state sospese a causa del lockdown. Puoi leggere di questa sequenza mancante nel capitolo dedicato ai goal primari del crowfunding.</p>
<p><strong>FESTIVAL MMXX</strong>. Organizzata e realizzata ""in casa"", presso la Conigliera, la piccola retrospettiva prevista per la celebrazione del ventennale a settembre, ha costi relativamente contenuti. Il budget prevede la copertura di spese artistiche, tecniche, di organizzazione, di logistica, di amministrazione. Il tutto progettato in assoluto rispetto delle norme vigenti in materia di sicurezza per la salute dei lavoratori e del pubblico, e di sanificazione dei locali. A parziale copertura degli eventi, Anagoor conta sulla partecipazione di sponsor privati e sulla vendita dei biglietti, ma in tempi di riduzione del pubblico a causa delle distanziazioni necessarie avremo bisogno di tutto il sostegno possibile. Quello che manca sono i fondi per un potenziamento della parte artistica per garantire agli ospiti invitati il giusto compenso.</p>
<p><strong>IL LIBRO</strong>.<strong> </strong>L'uscita di <i>Una festa tra noi e i morti </i>è l'esito di un lungo processo di immersione e analisi dell'opera di Eschilo, durato almeno tre anni, che non può essere quantificato in termini di tempo ed economici, ma solo di ""studio"" che vuole dire amore. La traduzione effettuata da Patrizia Vercesi e Simone Derai nel corso dei dodici mesi del 2017 è confluita e ha determinato la genesi drammaturgica dello spettacolo Orestea (2018). Il testo poetico tradotto, affiancato da note di regia dello stesso Derai, da una generosa indagine critica di Susanna Pietrosanti e da un'appendice di Lisa Gasparotto, diventa oggi, nel 2020, un progetto editoriale voluto, curato e sostenuto da Cronopio, che è una casa editrice prestigiosa e speciale, in collaborazione con Anagoor. La parte editoriale è coperta da Cronopio. Quello che manca è la copertura delle spese a sostegno dello studio precedente alla stesura del progetto, i libri acquistati, i viaggi intrapresi, e i costi corollari ma fondamentali di spedizione e promozione a sostegno dell'impegno profuso dalla casa editrice.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What we need: what is still missing </h3>
<p><u><strong>Obiettivi primari</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>1. INCISIONE DISCO</strong>. <strong>8000 € - </strong>Durante i mesi di lockdown Mauro Martinuz ha prodotto e remixato le tracce dell'album <i>MMXX. </i>Durante gli ultimi giorni di maggio, il doppio disco è entrato in fase di postproduzione e mastering a cura di Federico Pelle presso il Basement Studio di Vicenza. Ora l'album è pronto per essere trasferito su vinile, mentre le custodie e il booklet da collezione - disegnati da Derai, Favotto e Camargo - sono pronti per essere stampati da Grafiche Veneziane. Ed è qui soprattutto che tu puoi fare la differenza! Col tuo aiuto copriremo le spese di produzione, mastering e mixaggio, realizzazione transfer e galvanica, stampa dei vinili completi di etichette e buste, stampa custodie folder, imballaggio copie, opuscolo interno, siae. In caso non riuscissimo a raggiungere il goal prefissato, quest'opera, di fatto già in corso di realizzazione, dovrà essere interamente sostenuta dal fondo di produzione della compagnia. I ricavi delle vendite future del disco andranno a sostegno del mantenimento della Conigliera.</p>
<p><strong>2. RIPRESE AEREE SUL VESUVIO</strong>. <strong>1000 € - </strong>Quello che manca ancora al completamento artistico di ""Mephistopheles"", il film-concerto, sono le risorse per le riprese aeree che dovevano essere effettuate ad aprile sopra il cratere del Vesuvio e che sono state sospese a causa del lockdown. L'urgenza determinata dal contesto e dalle condizioni in cui ora ci troviamo a lavorare per mantenere la qualità e la perizia tecniche, nei tempi previsti dal progetto, ci richiedono uno sforzo maggiore. Volare sulla caldera del Vesuvio non è la cosa più facile da fare con i droni a causa di correnti e di campi magnetici particolari e per una serie di permessi da richiedere. Ci siamo attrezzati ma abbiamo bisogno del tuo aiuto. Anche in questo caso è qui che puoi intervenire facendo un'enorme differenza e partecipando direttamente alla creazione artistica: aiutaci a volare sul Vulcano!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591197289/ti6jf6bp5ddbmawzmsey.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1591197322/vkh3vuzbvgcnpwk20dkb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>3. COMPLETAMENTO DEL LIBRO</strong>. <strong>3000 € - </strong>Quello che manca alla pubblicazione è la copertura delle spese a sostegno dello studio precedente alla stesura del progetto poetico e saggistico: i libri acquistati, i viaggi intrapresi, e tutti quei costi corollari, ma fondamentali, di spedizione e di promozione ad ulteriore sostegno dell'impegno profuso dalla casa editrice. Contribuendo anche in parte all'intero progetto del ventennale, compenserete questo lungo percorso di studio e la genesi di un libro che ci sta molto a cuore. Sostenete Cronopio! Sostenete Anagoor!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590820096/dmwojagtzgulhauutvbt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><u><strong>Obiettivi aggiuntivi</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>4. IMPLEMENTO ARTISTICA FESTIVAL MMXX</strong>. <strong>5000 € - </strong>La manifestazione sarà più interessante a nostro giudizio se non si limiterà ad una retrospettiva dei lavori di Anagoor. Vorremmo poter invitare amici ospiti e sostenere il loro lavoro. Aiutaci a rendere più ricca la programmazione della rassegna!<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>5. DRIVE-IN FESTIVAL MMXX</strong>. <strong>3200 € - </strong>In tempi di covid-19 e di distanziazioni imposte per legge trovare soluzioni divertenti e intelligenti è un modo per non soccombere all'isolamento forzato. Alcune soluzioni sono sotto i nostri occhi fin dagli anni '50 e decisamente vintage: la nostra idea è quella di realizzare un drive-in in aperta campagna per la proiezione di film e video a cui assistere in tanti in totale sicurezza.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>6. TECNICA AGGIUNTIVA MMXX</strong>. <strong>3500 € - </strong>Sempre per le norme di legge in materia di salute, adeguare i locali e sanificarli per la fruizione in sicurezza da parte di lavoratori e spettatori ha un costo.<strong>  </strong></p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Impact &amp; challenges</h3>
<p>Anagoor non è solo un gruppo artistico. Anagoor è soprattutto la relazione che si instaura tra le opere create e il loro pubblico. Anagoor è il pensiero che resta, la meditazione che ritorna, l'eco dell'immagine. ""Scrivilo, incidilo nel cuore"" dice Elettra ad Oreste nelle <i>Coefore</i>. Ecco, in occasione di questi nostri vent'anni di percorso desidereremmo poter aggiungere un'orma, un'incisione, lasciare una traccia fisica di quell'eco, resti di una storia: il libro, il disco, il film, e poi la festa retrospettiva, per radunarci di concerto ancora una volta, in quel dolce e <i>improbabile</i> teatro campestre che è la Conigliera, e vincere la paura della prossimità o per augurarci di poter superare questo tempo che ci separa. Questo il goal artistico. Per raggiungerlo molte collaborazioni produttive sono già state instaurate (la casa editrice Cronopio, il Museo MADRE, i Festival teatrali italiani e stranieri che da anni sostengono la ricerca della compagnia). Da tempo abbiamo scelto l'indipendenza e siamo abituati a rimboccarci le maniche per allacciare sinergie, recuperare le risorse necessarie alle creazioni e sostenere la Conigliera. Una progettualità premiata nel 2018 dal sostegno ottenuto dalla Fondation d'Enterprise Hermès all'interno del programma New Settings. Con questo crowdfunding Anagoor per la prima volta si rivolge al proprio pubblico, ad amici ed estimatori. Siate come Mecenate per Virgilio, vi promettiamo in cambio corone d'alloro, musica, versi... teatro più forte della materia dei sogni.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Dream Team</h3>
<p><strong>Simone</strong>, scrive e dirige tutti gli spettacoli del gruppo, dirige e monta i video, disegna le scene e i costumi, fondatore e art director del progetto, è lui il mago che vede e parla ai fantasmi e ai dybbuk.</p>
<p><strong>Mauro</strong>, compone le musiche e disegna i paesaggi sonori delle opere. Le mura della città di Anagoor suonano, e lui è l'architetto della cinta. Tutti gli altri muri crollano, si dice che a Gerico fosse lui a suonare.</p>
<p><strong>Marco</strong>, soprannominato il Vescovo, è l'anima strategica del gruppo e il primo performer di Anagoor. La sua voce e la sua memoria sono quelle degli aedi.</p>
<p><strong>Giulio</strong>, il falco, dal 2013 è nella squadra apportando il suo talento fotografico, anche in volo. Dirige la fotografia dei video e si prende cura delle immagini promozionali del collettivo. </p>
<p><strong>Michele</strong>, è consigliere e stratega e alfiere. Si occupa del management artistico del gruppo, nutre le opere, le rende possibili, donando loro fondamenta stabili e spalle forti.</p>
<p><strong>Annalisa</strong>, curatrice e amministratrice delle attività, prevede i rischi ed elabora le soluzioni. Il calcio di una giraffa batte anche i leoni.</p>
<p><strong>Patrizia</strong>, pusher letterario e dramaturg e negromante.</p>
<p><strong>Rosalba</strong>, non solo un ufficio stampa, è il festaiolo dei dipinti rinascimentali che ti indica cosa guardare. E un poeta.</p>
<p><strong>Max</strong>, strega: affianca Simone nei laboratori e negli aspetti creativi legati all'ideazione delle figure: costumi, oggetti, immagini. Si prende cura degli ospiti in Conigliera.</p>
<p><strong>Bruno</strong>, artista visivo e performer. Connette mondi, intercetta segnali deboli e li trasforma in visioni luminose. Probabilmente è una spia intercontinentale.</p>
<p><strong>Eliza</strong>, il cerbiatto d'acciaio, è performer in Anagoor fin da giovanissima: ha preso parte alle maggiori creazioni della Compagnia e cura la pagina instagram <strong>@house.of.anagoor</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Moreno &amp; Luca</strong>, web masters of the universe. <strong><a href=""http://www.anagoor.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.anagoor.com</a></strong></p>

Anagoor è un progetto artistico che sceglie per le proprie creazioni il campo gravitazionale del teatro. Le forme assunte dalle opere sono le più diverse, eppure restano spiccatamente inerenti al teatro, lo provocano, ne testano i limiti. Un principio che precipita in diversi formati finali dove immagine, poesia, performing art, filosofia, musica e scena ipermediale entrano in dialogo, pretendendo tuttavia, in virtù della natura di quest’arte, di rimanere teatro. Ma soprattutto Anagoor è la storia di un gruppo. Nasce nel 2000 a Castelfranco Veneto. Dal 2010 fa parte dei progetti di curatela di Centrale Fies. Nel 2018 ha ricevuto il Leone d’Argento per l'innovazione teatrale alla Biennale di Venezia e nel 2020 compie vent’anni. Anagoor non riceve contributi pubblici.

 
Who we are: our home
Dal 2008 Anagoor ha preso a cuore le sorti di uno spazio, un ex allevamento di conigli, facendone il proprio atelier artistico: La Conigliera di Castelminio, in Veneto. Conservandone le caratteristiche architettoniche, Anagoor ha trasformato un incubatore cunicolo intensivo in culla delle arti contemporanee. Attività di scuola e laboratoriali, esposizioni ed eventi si tengono saltuariamente in alternanza ai periodi di creazione e di prove.
 

 
La Conigliera è un centro di produzione delle arti performative e uno studio di posa che offre appoggio e residenza anche ad altri artisti e gruppi, aperto alla ricerca, alle residenze, alle attività di formazione e all'organizzazione di eventi privati. La Conigliera, struttura vitale per la produzione artistica di Anagoor, non riceve sostegni pubblici né sponsorizzazioni ed è interamente mantenuta grazie all'impegno della compagnia.
 

 
What we have in store: a metamorphosis
Per celebrare questi primi vent’anni di creazione (MM-MMXX) sono in cantiere un libro, un disco, un film-concerto, una retrospettiva: oggetti fisici ed eventi, opere d'arte dalla natura diversa che in piena crisi pandemica propongono un'idea di sopravvivenza del teatro in altra forma, ipotizzano modalità di salvataggio della memoria della più effimera tra le arti, concettualizzano il suo eterno mutare pelle, il suo permanere, il suo ripresentarsi. Contribuendo a questo crowdfunding parteciperai direttamente alla creazione di queste opere, all'incisione del doppio vinile, alla pubblicazione del saggio, alla produzione del film, alla realizzazione degli eventi live, alla preservazione della memoria della produzione artistica del gruppo, al sostegno della Conigliera. 
 

 
1. A Double Album
""MMXX"" è il titolo di un album, un doppio vinile da collezione che è attualmente in fase di incisione e mixaggio. Prodotto da Anagoor, contiene nel primo disco, LIBER I, vent'anni di musica e sound design composti da Mauro Martinuz per le più celebri creazioni teatrali del collettivo (Magnificat, Lingua Imperii, Socrate il Sopravvissuto, Orestea...), e nel secondo disco, LIBER II, la registrazione della performance del Secondo Libro dell'Eneide di Virgilio eseguita da Marco Menegoni al Piccolo Teatro di Milano nel 2016.
 

 
Il doppio album si presenta dunque come un archivio che raccoglie la memoria del teatro (arte notoriamente effimera e difficile da catturare), trovando per la performance dal vivo una nuova forma, il vinile, e per le composizioni musicali di Martinuz, che tanta parte hanno nelle creazioni di Anagoor, l'attenzione che meritano. La registrazione dal vivo della performance del Secondo Libro dell'Eneide tratta dallo spettacolo Virgilio Brucia ferma su disco un evento teatrale memorabile con Menegoni che recita, in uno dei teatri più importanti d’Italia, i più emozionanti versi virgiliani a perdifiato, in latino e in metrica, sull'incessante beat elettronico di Martinuz: in una lingua morta che non è mai stata così viva permane la memoria dell'incendio di Troia, dello sterminio di un popolo, della fuga per mare.
 





 
Il doppio vinile conterrà un booklet con l'intero testo poetico e un codice per il download della versione digitale dei contenuti audio dei due dischi. Scaricando la versione digitale del doppio album non solo avrai modo di ascoltare sul device che preferisci e ovunque andrai le musiche di Martinuz e i versi del poeta dell'Eneide, ma avrai in omaggio anche cinque tracce speciali non incluse nel vinile. Il download contiene in più una versione del booklet con la traduzione degli esametri di Virgilio in italiano, inglese e in francese.

2. A Book
""UNA FESTA TRA NOI E I MORTI, sull’Orestea di Eschilo"" è invece il titolo del libro di Simone Derai che sarà edito da Cronopio nel 2020. Con questa pubblicazione si intende rendere conto del lavoro drammaturgico e di traduzione compiuto sulla trilogia di Eschilo messa in scena da Anagoor nel 2018. Orestea / Agamennone, Schiavi, Conversio, che ha inaugurato il 46° Festival internazionale del Teatro della Biennale di Venezia, è un lavoro teatrale che si dichiara fin dal titolo sull’Orestea di Eschilo. Non una riduzione del testo originale, né un trattamento della vicenda, ma un confronto con l’opera che estende il dominio del teatro ai campi anti-teatrali della performance e della critica. Il libro racconta, spalancandoli e non nascondendoli, i problemi di traduzione, non solo linguistica, e di rappresentazione della tragedia oggi.
 


 
Cosa significa recarsi a cospetto dell'opera di Eschilo? Come fare i conti con la sua materia drammatica e, in primo luogo, verbale senza scegliere le scorciatoie dell'attualizzazione? Come affrontare la scalata a quell’impalcatura bifida che sorregge i due discorsi, paralleli e intrecciati come i serpenti del caduceo, sulla giustizia e sull’essere? Attraverso la lettura ontologica dell’Orestea, debitrice della lezione imprescindibile di Emanuele Severino, scomparso proprio quest'anno, si delinea anche un’idea del tragico imprevista: anziché stabilire una volta per tutte l’ineluttabilità e l’insolubilità dei conflitti, Eschilo pare invocare un superamento della contesa per mezzo di una sospensione dell’agire. La ribellione sta nel rifiutare l'accanimento.
 



 
L’Orestea di Anagoor non rincorre solo Eschilo, ma anche Socrate, Broch, Severino, Givone, l’amato Sebald, la Harendt, Mazzoni: una muta di Virgilii apripista per scendere a ritroso nel tempo, fin dentro la sera, fin dentro la notte, lungo la schiena dell’Occidente, e risalire poi il sentiero che dal bacino del Mediterraneo attraversa le foreste europee, all’inseguimento delle tracce che portano ai rituali funebri, all’origine del teatro, alle ossessioni e ai deliri del continente, alle fosse comuni.
 



 
La pubblicazione del testo completo dell’Agamennone di Anagoor, tradotto da Simone Derai e Patrizia Vercesi, offre l’occasione per narrare questo viaggio che si dipana in due altri capitoli scenici sorti dal confronto con l’opera di Eschilo: Schiavi, che ancora conserva lacerti di Coefore, e Conversio che pur abbandonando la parola di Eschilo, riafferma per la parola, proprio in virtù di questo abbandono, una disperata potenza di salvezza da ogni incendio. Il libro contiene Con i cani e con la rete, note sulla traduzione e indagini testuali, importante saggio di Susanna Pietrosanti.
 


 
 
3. A Concert-film
""MEPHISTOPHELES eine Grand Tour"" è il titolo di un film concerto, attualmente in fase di produzione, che al suo debutto sarà uno dei primi eventi dal vivo dopo la riapertura del Paese: il prossimo 2 luglio, infatti, la proiezione concerto aprirà il Napoli Teatro Festival Italia, all'interno del Cortile d'Onore di Palazzo Reale. Poi sarà presentato a Centrale Fies, all'Operaestate Festival Veneto di Bassano del Grappa, al KunstFest di Weimar in Germania in settembre e poi ancora al Museo MADRE di Napoli e al Fit Festival di Lugano in Svizzera. 
 

 
Questo concerto per immagini era in cantiere fin da prima della pandemia e ora ci appare come un'opera profetica per temi (la malattia, la morte, le case di riposo, lo sfruttamento intensivo degli animali, il senso che abbiamo del sacro...) e per forma, nel suo presentarsi come teatro senza attori, spettacolo dal vivo ed epifania del corpo, ma in assenza dei corpi.
 

 
«Tutto questo e varie altre circostanze concomitanti mi spingono e mi costringono a smarrirmi in regioni del mondo ove nessuno mi conosca. Parto solo, sotto nome incognito, e da quest'impresa apparentemente stravagante mi riprometto il meglio possibile.»
Così Goethe in una lettera al duca Karl August del 2 settembre 1786 annuncia il suo Grand Tour; partirà da Karlsbad il giorno seguente, verso le 3 del mattino, munito di un passaporto falso che recava il nome di Philipp Möller. Sotto il nome del demone bugiardo che tentò Faust, Mephistopheles (il dispensatore-di-menzogne), Anagoor raduna il materiale video raccolto in vent'anni in un grande viaggio per immagini attraverso le lacrime del mondo, musicato in un live set elettronico da Mauro Martinuz.
 

 
Mephistopheles (colui-che-ha-in-odio-la-luce) è un Grand Tour nelle zone buie del cosmo, lì dove scaturiscono insieme la tenebra e le sofferenze delle generazioni, il rapporto dell’uomo con la natura, con l’eros, con i compagni animali, con il tempo e con la tecnica, con l’assoluto: l’impossibile. La materia cinematografica di spettacoli teatrali come Lingua Imperii, Virgilio Brucia, Socrate il sopravvissuto, Faust, Orestea è composta da immagini raccolte nei musei e nei templi, nelle case di cura per anziani e negli allevamenti intensivi, tra macellai, pastori e pellegrini, in India, in Iran, ad Olimpia, sulla ferita campagna veneta e sul Vesuvio. L’enorme quantità di materiale inedito trova nuova composizione in questo volo e caduta in forma di concerto cum figuris.
 

 
4. A Series of Live Events
""MMXX"" è anche il titolo di una serie di eventi live con cui culmineranno le celebrazioni per il ventennale della compagnia. La casa-atelier di Anagoor, la Conigliera di Castelminio, sarà aperta per tutto il mese di settembre: spettacoli, installazioni, videoproiezioni, concerti, live set, conferenze ed incontri con il pubblico si alterneranno tra la fine dell'estate e l'autunno 2020. Non solo una retrospettiva, ma anche un programma che si arricchirà di performance di amici artisti. Il programma è in corso di elaborazione e sarà soggetto alle disposizioni sanitarie.
 
FUNDS ALLOCATION
What we need: the complete budget

Un progetto così articolato, la produzione di opere così diversificate hanno costi non indifferenti. Anagoor ha già provveduto a stringere virtuosa alleanza con diversi partner e i costi più ingenti sono già coperti. Quello che manca alla completa realizzazione del progetto, tuttavia, ha bisogno del tuo prezioso contributo. Il crowdfunding mira a colmare i costi non ancora coperti. Qui di seguito indichiamo i costi dell'intero progetto, illustrando quanto già raccolto, quanto manca alla copertura totale, i tempi di realizzazione, gli interventi vitali per la buona riuscita.


What we need: what is already funded
PRODUZIONE MEPHISTOPHELES. La produzione del film-concerto è la parte economicamente più consistente dell'intero progetto, ma a differenza delle altre iniziative e creazioni ha già in gran parte una copertura produttiva a cui partecipano il Napoli Teatro Festival Italia, Centrale Fies, il Museo Madre di Napoli, Operaestate Festival, il KunstFest Weimar, il Theater an der Ruhr di Mülheim an der Ruhr.  Il budget copre le spese di personale e realizzazione, il noleggio di materiale video e costi di ripresa, i permessi e le autorizzazioni per filmare, direzione della fotografia, montaggio video, studio di registrazione, viaggi e residenza, acquisto materiale audio, direzione tecnica, e altri costi tecnici relativi alla produzione dell'evento dal vivo. Quello che manca ancora sono le risorse per le riprese aeree che dovevano essere effettuate ad aprile sopra il cratere del Vesuvio e che sono state sospese a causa del lockdown. Puoi leggere di questa sequenza mancante nel capitolo dedicato ai goal primari del crowfunding.
FESTIVAL MMXX. Organizzata e realizzata ""in casa"", presso la Conigliera, la piccola retrospettiva prevista per la celebrazione del ventennale a settembre, ha costi relativamente contenuti. Il budget prevede la copertura di spese artistiche, tecniche, di organizzazione, di logistica, di amministrazione. Il tutto progettato in assoluto rispetto delle norme vigenti in materia di sicurezza per la salute dei lavoratori e del pubblico, e di sanificazione dei locali. A parziale copertura degli eventi, Anagoor conta sulla partecipazione di sponsor privati e sulla vendita dei biglietti, ma in tempi di riduzione del pubblico a causa delle distanziazioni necessarie avremo bisogno di tutto il sostegno possibile. Quello che manca sono i fondi per un potenziamento della parte artistica per garantire agli ospiti invitati il giusto compenso.
IL LIBRO. L'uscita di Una festa tra noi e i morti è l'esito di un lungo processo di immersione e analisi dell'opera di Eschilo, durato almeno tre anni, che non può essere quantificato in termini di tempo ed economici, ma solo di ""studio"" che vuole dire amore. La traduzione effettuata da Patrizia Vercesi e Simone Derai nel corso dei dodici mesi del 2017 è confluita e ha determinato la genesi drammaturgica dello spettacolo Orestea (2018). Il testo poetico tradotto, affiancato da note di regia dello stesso Derai, da una generosa indagine critica di Susanna Pietrosanti e da un'appendice di Lisa Gasparotto, diventa oggi, nel 2020, un progetto editoriale voluto, curato e sostenuto da Cronopio, che è una casa editrice prestigiosa e speciale, in collaborazione con Anagoor. La parte editoriale è coperta da Cronopio. Quello che manca è la copertura delle spese a sostegno dello studio precedente alla stesura del progetto, i libri acquistati, i viaggi intrapresi, e i costi corollari ma fondamentali di spedizione e promozione a sostegno dell'impegno profuso dalla casa editrice.
 
What we need: what is still missing 
Obiettivi primari
1. INCISIONE DISCO. 8000 € - Durante i mesi di lockdown Mauro Martinuz ha prodotto e remixato le tracce dell'album MMXX. Durante gli ultimi giorni di maggio, il doppio disco è entrato in fase di postproduzione e mastering a cura di Federico Pelle presso il Basement Studio di Vicenza. Ora l'album è pronto per essere trasferito su vinile, mentre le custodie e il booklet da collezione - disegnati da Derai, Favotto e Camargo - sono pronti per essere stampati da Grafiche Veneziane. Ed è qui soprattutto che tu puoi fare la differenza! Col tuo aiuto copriremo le spese di produzione, mastering e mixaggio, realizzazione transfer e galvanica, stampa dei vinili completi di etichette e buste, stampa custodie folder, imballaggio copie, opuscolo interno, siae. In caso non riuscissimo a raggiungere il goal prefissato, quest'opera, di fatto già in corso di realizzazione, dovrà essere interamente sostenuta dal fondo di produzione della compagnia. I ricavi delle vendite future del disco andranno a sostegno del mantenimento della Conigliera.
2. RIPRESE AEREE SUL VESUVIO. 1000 € - Quello che manca ancora al completamento artistico di ""Mephistopheles"", il film-concerto, sono le risorse per le riprese aeree che dovevano essere effettuate ad aprile sopra il cratere del Vesuvio e che sono state sospese a causa del lockdown. L'urgenza determinata dal contesto e dalle condizioni in cui ora ci troviamo a lavorare per mantenere la qualità e la perizia tecniche, nei tempi previsti dal progetto, ci richiedono uno sforzo maggiore. Volare sulla caldera del Vesuvio non è la cosa più facile da fare con i droni a causa di correnti e di campi magnetici particolari e per una serie di permessi da richiedere. Ci siamo attrezzati ma abbiamo bisogno del tuo aiuto. Anche in questo caso è qui che puoi intervenire facendo un'enorme differenza e partecipando direttamente alla creazione artistica: aiutaci a volare sul Vulcano!

3. COMPLETAMENTO DEL LIBRO. 3000 € - Quello che manca alla pubblicazione è la copertura delle spese a sostegno dello studio precedente alla stesura del progetto poetico e saggistico: i libri acquistati, i viaggi intrapresi, e tutti quei costi corollari, ma fondamentali, di spedizione e di promozione ad ulteriore sostegno dell'impegno profuso dalla casa editrice. Contribuendo anche in parte all'intero progetto del ventennale, compenserete questo lungo percorso di studio e la genesi di un libro che ci sta molto a cuore. Sostenete Cronopio! Sostenete Anagoor!

Obiettivi aggiuntivi
4. IMPLEMENTO ARTISTICA FESTIVAL MMXX. 5000 € - La manifestazione sarà più interessante a nostro giudizio se non si limiterà ad una retrospettiva dei lavori di Anagoor. Vorremmo poter invitare amici ospiti e sostenere il loro lavoro. Aiutaci a rendere più ricca la programmazione della rassegna! 
5. DRIVE-IN FESTIVAL MMXX. 3200 € - In tempi di covid-19 e di distanziazioni imposte per legge trovare soluzioni divertenti e intelligenti è un modo per non soccombere all'isolamento forzato. Alcune soluzioni sono sotto i nostri occhi fin dagli anni '50 e decisamente vintage: la nostra idea è quella di realizzare un drive-in in aperta campagna per la proiezione di film e video a cui assistere in tanti in totale sicurezza. 
6. TECNICA AGGIUNTIVA MMXX. 3500 € - Sempre per le norme di legge in materia di salute, adeguare i locali e sanificarli per la fruizione in sicurezza da parte di lavoratori e spettatori ha un costo.  
 

Impact & challenges
Anagoor non è solo un gruppo artistico. Anagoor è soprattutto la relazione che si instaura tra le opere create e il loro pubblico. Anagoor è il pensiero che resta, la meditazione che ritorna, l'eco dell'immagine. ""Scrivilo, incidilo nel cuore"" dice Elettra ad Oreste nelle Coefore. Ecco, in occasione di questi nostri vent'anni di percorso desidereremmo poter aggiungere un'orma, un'incisione, lasciare una traccia fisica di quell'eco, resti di una storia: il libro, il disco, il film, e poi la festa retrospettiva, per radunarci di concerto ancora una volta, in quel dolce e improbabile teatro campestre che è la Conigliera, e vincere la paura della prossimità o per augurarci di poter superare questo tempo che ci separa. Questo il goal artistico. Per raggiungerlo molte collaborazioni produttive sono già state instaurate (la casa editrice Cronopio, il Museo MADRE, i Festival teatrali italiani e stranieri che da anni sostengono la ricerca della compagnia). Da tempo abbiamo scelto l'indipendenza e siamo abituati a rimboccarci le maniche per allacciare sinergie, recuperare le risorse necessarie alle creazioni e sostenere la Conigliera. Una progettualità premiata nel 2018 dal sostegno ottenuto dalla Fondation d'Enterprise Hermès all'interno del programma New Settings. Con questo crowdfunding Anagoor per la prima volta si rivolge al proprio pubblico, ad amici ed estimatori. Siate come Mecenate per Virgilio, vi promettiamo in cambio corone d'alloro, musica, versi... teatro più forte della materia dei sogni.
 
The Dream Team
Simone, scrive e dirige tutti gli spettacoli del gruppo, dirige e monta i video, disegna le scene e i costumi, fondatore e art director del progetto, è lui il mago che vede e parla ai fantasmi e ai dybbuk.
Mauro, compone le musiche e disegna i paesaggi sonori delle opere. Le mura della città di Anagoor suonano, e lui è l'architetto della cinta. Tutti gli altri muri crollano, si dice che a Gerico fosse lui a suonare.
Marco, soprannominato il Vescovo, è l'anima strategica del gruppo e il primo performer di Anagoor. La sua voce e la sua memoria sono quelle degli aedi.
Giulio, il falco, dal 2013 è nella squadra apportando il suo talento fotografico, anche in volo. Dirige la fotografia dei video e si prende cura delle immagini promozionali del collettivo. 
Michele, è consigliere e stratega e alfiere. Si occupa del management artistico del gruppo, nutre le opere, le rende possibili, donando loro fondamenta stabili e spalle forti.
Annalisa, curatrice e amministratrice delle attività, prevede i rischi ed elabora le soluzioni. Il calcio di una giraffa batte anche i leoni.
Patrizia, pusher letterario e dramaturg e negromante.
Rosalba, non solo un ufficio stampa, è il festaiolo dei dipinti rinascimentali che ti indica cosa guardare. E un poeta.
Max, strega: affianca Simone nei laboratori e negli aspetti creativi legati all'ideazione delle figure: costumi, oggetti, immagini. Si prende cura degli ospiti in Conigliera.
Bruno, artista visivo e performer. Connette mondi, intercetta segnali deboli e li trasforma in visioni luminose. Probabilmente è una spia intercontinentale.
Eliza, il cerbiatto d'acciaio, è performer in Anagoor fin da giovanissima: ha preso parte alle maggiori creazioni della Compagnia e cura la pagina instagram @house.of.anagoor.
Moreno & Luca, web masters of the universe. www.anagoor.com

sculpture for the rest of my life and I needed to learn how to make my pieces
withstand human interaction. I learned to properly build steel structures in
the welding department at Austin Community College and went on to work in small
shops and large factories in order to gain real world building experience. When
I returned to college in 2010 to finish my Bachelor's of Fine Art, I found clay
and knew I had stumbled on something big.  Over the years I have assembled
a mostly functional studio for myself in my home. I work out of it everyday and
cannot imagine any other life for myself. </p>
<p><b>Enter
the Chautauqua Institution.</b></p>
<p>The summer art program at the
Institution is geared toward artists at the beginning of their professional
careers. The emphasis is on daily immersion in the arts and optimum utilization
of studio time. Because my studio is in my home (which I share with my very
supportive family), distractions abound. The seven weeks spent exploring with
other studio artists and educators will offer me new contacts and experiences
unique to the Chautauqua Institution. Just forty dedicated students are chosen
for the summer art program from around the world, and I am so thrilled to be
one of them!</p>
<p><b>Times
are tight.</b></p>
<p>Because I am a new studio artist, my
patron list is short. My family of four makes it on my husband's teaching salary,
so there isn't much cash for the upfront out of pocket costs of being an
artist.</p>
<p>I received a half scholarship from the
Chautauqua Institution, so I need you to help me raise the rest of the money. I
must pay my balance by June 1 in order to keep my spot. </p>
<p><b>The breakdown.</b></p>
<p>I am short $2110 for the rest of
tuition, room and board. Also $1000 for 49 days worth of clay and drawing
supplies plus the shipping costs of getting my tools and supplies from Texas to
New York, $1500 for a round trip plane ticket, taxi to and from the airport and
incidentals like laundry, taxis, forgotten art supplies and coffee. Every penny
goes towards this trip. Anything raised over the goal goes into consumables
(clay, steel, gas, etc.) and/or equipment for my studio. </p>
<p><b>The perks.</b></p>
<p>I am offering a limited run vinyl sticker, individual paper, steel, or ceramic cranes and mobiles made from the cranes from my
BFA installation. The work, titled <i>Lift, </i>consisted of nearly 1000 cranes
made from paper, steel and ceramic. <br/><br/>
Mobiles are made with hand smithed steel bits and heavy mono-filament.<br/><br/>
Please note * Mobiles are custom made. I will begin work on those when I return
from Chautauqua in August. Tentatively shipping late August or early
September.  </p>
<p><b>I
can't wait.</b></p>
<p>Opportunities like the Chautauqua
Institute only come to those who work hard and keep trying. I won't ever stop.
I was taught to stay focused and work diligently to make the life I dream of a
reality. I try to be an example of this for my children and my peers. I am
still in close contact with the University of Texas Pan American, where I
earned my BFA. Several of the students there have never left the Rio Grande
Valley, and I intend to plant in them the seeds of new perspectives. </p>
<p>The work produced while at Chautauqua
will further my portfolio which only leads to new exciting adventures. Maybe
even graduate school!</p>

Institute only come to those who work hard and keep trying. I won't ever stop.
I was taught to stay focused and work diligently to make the life I dream of a
reality. I try to be an example of this for my children and my peers. I am
still in close contact with the University of Texas Pan American, where I
earned my BFA. Several of the students there have never left the Rio Grande
Valley, and I intend to plant in them the seeds of new perspectives. 
The work produced while at Chautauqua
will further my portfolio which only leads to new exciting adventures. Maybe
even graduate school!
Thank
you!

I have just received
a grant from the Ashland-based Lloyd Haines Philanthropic Foundation to
partially fund the creation of a 27 foot x 2.5 foot mosaic mural (to be place on the Main St. side of Grotto Pizza) for the town that I love, Talent (see drawing above)!
You might ask, “Why do you need more money, Karen”? Well, the grant covers research, design, and planning for the mural, but most of the
materials and studio expenses aren't covered by the grant.<div>
<br/> <b></b><p style=""display: inline !important;""><b>How I'll do it and how you can help: </b></p>Here is the chance for you to participate, either by helping to construct this newest mural directly, or by donating and having your own wildlife/horse donor tile created to be a part this mosaic that is Talent. (See drawings in the Gallery section)<b> </b><p style=""display: inline !important;"">As pledges come in, I will be creating the specialty tiles for donors, as well as the horse tiles that make up the main scene of the mural in my home studio in Talent. I will select a tile for you from your chosen category, to make sure there's plenty of variety of critters.  </p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/805932/files/20140822200215-indiegogoscan1.jpg?1408762935"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>Businesses, as well as individuals, will happily  be
acknowledged on the Pony Up for Talent Public Art Facebook page, though only
individual or family names will be used on the actual tiles. I will be inviting
and encouraging other experienced ceramic artists from Talent and the surrounding
area to help in this process as much as possible. The donor tiles will be more
detail-oriented and labor-intensive, as each piece will be hand cut, textured,
hand-stamped with the donors' names, and hand-glazed one at a time. Once the
fundraising is over, and all the donor tiles completed, we will be making and
sourcing more tile for the landscape fill areas. Helpers from the community
will set these (perhaps you) under my direction and with the help of other
mosaic artists from the area. There will be nine 2.5 x 3 foot panel sections to
complete before installation. Check the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/PonyUpforTalentPublicArt"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>Pony Up for
Talent Public Art Facebook</span></a> page to view drawings and sample tiles, see details of the mural design, and to connect for volunteer
opportunities and updates!</p>
<p><b>My values as an artist:</b> As a member of the Community Built Association, I am empowered by the concept that art can not only beautify and energize a place, but more importantly it can bring community members together, get them talking, and participating in positive creation, making for a more harmonious, vibrant, and wonderful place to live and visit.</p>
<p><b>Why I've chosen Equamore horses as my subject:  </b>My mural will depict the
horses of the <a href=""http://www.equamore.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Equamore Foundation</a>, a 23-year-old non-profit horse rescue
organization for neglected, abused, and abandoned horses.  I intend this mural to be a way to honor the horses for their stoic will to survive as well as bring attention to this worthy cause in our Valley while adding a beautiful piece of art to our town's core. Talent
is a rural community of about 6500 people, situated in the Rogue
Valley. When I moved out here 10 years ago from the mid-west the number of
horses in this valley immediately struck me, as well as the number of people
involved with horses. Having grown up in Oklahoma, I'd
seen horse country, but our Valley is teeming with these beautiful animals, as
well as an abundance of wildlife. As much as folks love their animals, there
are always circumstances like the 2008 recession, that begin the long slide
into poverty, and unfortunately the animals are often the first to suffer. <br/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/803715/files/20140821153308-Casper_and_Crowd.jpg?1408660388"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
Many of the rescued horses at Equamore are brought in as skin and bones. Some
have been left for months or years relying solely on themselves to find food
and water. Others have been physically abused to the point of no longer being
safe around people anymore. The good folks at Equamore, mostly volunteers, have
been working hard to take care of these poor beauties and rehabilitate them as
best they can. They currently have over 50 horses on site. Though a few are in
foster homes, they will never have an owner other than the Equamore Foundation due
to their prior abuse. As the only organization of it's kind in this Valley, Equamore provides a critical service for our horse-loving community.<p></p>
<p><b>Past success with community created art:</b> In 2010 I attended the
Ford Family Foundation's community leadership training. As the lead artist, I, along with other community members, created Talent's
first official piece of public art —  a mural, which is located on
the side of a local downtown business. We not only addressed city codes to
allow for public art, but also rejuvenated the Talent Public Arts Committee in
the process.  Using an innovative
""paint-by-numbers"" technique allowed community members, most self proclaimed ""non-artists"" to create a </p>

<p>33 foot x 11.5 foot mural
celebrating our town, its people, and the diversity and creativity we love. We
had over 60 people ranging in age from 4 years to 96 years, painting this first
of it's kind piece of art side by side over many weeks and months. For some it
was the first art they had done since childhood, for others it was a lifelong
passion. For most, it was a wonderful opportunity to do something fun and
positive in their community. One couple celebrated their 26th wedding anniversary
painting with their newfound neighbors. Many  conversations and stories that folks shared while doing the ""work"" of creation. The process was so much more
than I had hoped for and I felt so lucky to be a part of it. Even
after the mural was completed and installed folks were continuing to stop me on
the street, telling me how much fun it was, and how they now knew more people in
their town. They were anxious for more!</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>My plea to you/How to connect: </b><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""> T</b>hank you for helping to bring this project to fruition, whether
you are currently living in Talent, have visited, or have always wanted to come
out here!  <br/></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>I hope to be able to include as many community members, old and young, as possible in the creation of this mural. One thing I feel passionate about is re-igniting the creative fire we all once had as children but somehow lost along the way to adulthood and the ""real"" world. Allowing ourselves to be creative people, without the need to be perfect at it, or to feel the need to create a finished product, is a freeing and fun experience no one should abandon. Allowing ourselves the pleasure of engaging with our friends and neighbors in a fun pursuit is time well spent. </p>
<p>I am fully committed to completing and installing this mural,
regardless of total monies earned. I'd love to have your time, treasure, and
talent represented in this project for the betterment of the Equamore horses,
our community, and your life!</p>

up for public art!Me and What I need: Hi, my name is Karen Rycheck and I'm a mosaic/ceramic artist living here in the lovely Rogue Valley of Southern Oregon. I have just received
a grant from the Ashland-based Lloyd Haines Philanthropic Foundation to
partially fund the creation of a 27 foot x 2.5 foot mosaic mural (to be place on the Main St. side of Grotto Pizza) for the town that I love, Talent (see drawing above)!
You might ask, “Why do you need more money, Karen”? Well, the grant covers research, design, and planning for the mural, but most of the
materials and studio expenses aren't covered by the grant.
 How I'll do it and how you can help: Here is the chance for you to participate, either by helping to construct this newest mural directly, or by donating and having your own wildlife/horse donor tile created to be a part this mosaic that is Talent. (See drawings in the Gallery section) As pledges come in, I will be creating the specialty tiles for donors, as well as the horse tiles that make up the main scene of the mural in my home studio in Talent. I will select a tile for you from your chosen category, to make sure there's plenty of variety of critters.  



Businesses, as well as individuals, will happily  be
acknowledged on the Pony Up for Talent Public Art Facebook page, though only
individual or family names will be used on the actual tiles. I will be inviting
and encouraging other experienced ceramic artists from Talent and the surrounding
area to help in this process as much as possible. The donor tiles will be more
detail-oriented and labor-intensive, as each piece will be hand cut, textured,
hand-stamped with the donors' names, and hand-glazed one at a time. Once the
fundraising is over, and all the donor tiles completed, we will be making and
sourcing more tile for the landscape fill areas. Helpers from the community
will set these (perhaps you) under my direction and with the help of other
mosaic artists from the area. There will be nine 2.5 x 3 foot panel sections to
complete before installation. Check the Pony Up for
Talent Public Art Facebook page to view drawings and sample tiles, see details of the mural design, and to connect for volunteer
opportunities and updates!
My values as an artist: As a member of the Community Built Association, I am empowered by the concept that art can not only beautify and energize a place, but more importantly it can bring community members together, get them talking, and participating in positive creation, making for a more harmonious, vibrant, and wonderful place to live and visit.
Why I've chosen Equamore horses as my subject:  My mural will depict the
horses of the Equamore Foundation, a 23-year-old non-profit horse rescue
organization for neglected, abused, and abandoned horses.  I intend this mural to be a way to honor the horses for their stoic will to survive as well as bring attention to this worthy cause in our Valley while adding a beautiful piece of art to our town's core. Talent
is a rural community of about 6500 people, situated in the Rogue
Valley. When I moved out here 10 years ago from the mid-west the number of
horses in this valley immediately struck me, as well as the number of people
involved with horses. Having grown up in Oklahoma, I'd
seen horse country, but our Valley is teeming with these beautiful animals, as
well as an abundance of wildlife. As much as folks love their animals, there
are always circumstances like the 2008 recession, that begin the long slide
into poverty, and unfortunately the animals are often the first to suffer. 

Many of the rescued horses at Equamore are brought in as skin and bones. Some
have been left for months or years relying solely on themselves to find food
and water. Others have been physically abused to the point of no longer being
safe around people anymore. The good folks at Equamore, mostly volunteers, have
been working hard to take care of these poor beauties and rehabilitate them as
best they can. They currently have over 50 horses on site. Though a few are in
foster homes, they will never have an owner other than the Equamore Foundation due
to their prior abuse. As the only organization of it's kind in this Valley, Equamore provides a critical service for our horse-loving community.
Past success with community created art: In 2010 I attended the
Ford Family Foundation's community leadership training. As the lead artist, I, along with other community members, created Talent's
first official piece of public art —  a mural, which is located on
the side of a local downtown business. We not only addressed city codes to
allow for public art, but also rejuvenated the Talent Public Arts Committee in
the process.  Using an innovative
""paint-by-numbers"" technique allowed community members, most self proclaimed ""non-artists"" to create a 



33 foot x 11.5 foot mural
celebrating our town, its people, and the diversity and creativity we love. We
had over 60 people ranging in age from 4 years to 96 years, painting this first
of it's kind piece of art side by side over many weeks and months. For some it
was the first art they had done since childhood, for others it was a lifelong
passion. For most, it was a wonderful opportunity to do something fun and
positive in their community. One couple celebrated their 26th wedding anniversary
painting with their newfound neighbors. Many  conversations and stories that folks shared while doing the ""work"" of creation. The process was so much more
than I had hoped for and I felt so lucky to be a part of it. Even
after the mural was completed and installed folks were continuing to stop me on
the street, telling me how much fun it was, and how they now knew more people in
their town. They were anxious for more!

My plea to you/How to connect:  Thank you for helping to bring this project to fruition, whether
you are currently living in Talent, have visited, or have always wanted to come
out here!  

I hope to be able to include as many community members, old and young, as possible in the creation of this mural. One thing I feel passionate about is re-igniting the creative fire we all once had as children but somehow lost along the way to adulthood and the ""real"" world. Allowing ourselves to be creative people, without the need to be perfect at it, or to feel the need to create a finished product, is a freeing and fun experience no one should abandon. Allowing ourselves the pleasure of engaging with our friends and neighbors in a fun pursuit is time well spent. 
I am fully committed to completing and installing this mural,
regardless of total monies earned. I'd love to have your time, treasure, and
talent represented in this project for the betterment of the Equamore horses,
our community, and your life!

Last August we had 15 local and visiting artists from 5 countries paint 10 walls around the city over the course of one week. This year we are planning to do it again with another inspiring group of 20 artists, half local and half visiting from around the world. With your help, we can continue to share the creative process in a public setting and provide our artists with the resources they need to bring more world-class contemporary art to the walls of Portland.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>How your donations will help.</h3><p>Unfortunately, the costs related to painting a dozen large scale murals isn't cheap...the $12,500 won't cover the whole thing, but it will be a huge help with the following expenses:</p><p>Supplies: mostly paint...we need a lot of it!

<h3>Breve reseña</h3>
<p>Hola, somos Eunice, Víctor e Ingrid productores de Utopía y queremos pedir tu apoyo para poder llevar acabo este increíble festival.<br/></p>
<p>Utopía, Arte y Tecnología en Interacción es un proyecto que busca hacer una reflexión ante la relación que existe entre el arte y la tecnología hoy en día. El arte siempre ha sido una de las mejores maneras de contar la historia de la humanidad y en este momento la tecnología forma parte de ésta historia. Finalmente las tecnologías que conocemos hoy en día nacieron como utopías. <br/></p>
<p>Utopía, además de ser un proyecto que busca acercar a las personas que no están relacionadas con este tipo de arte emergente e interesarlos por ella, es el proyecto de titulación de Eunice. Ella es alumna de comunicación de la Universidad Iberoamericana con especiaización en el área de entretenimiento, así que por medio de este evento, logrará obtener su título universitario. </p>
<p>El festival se presentará del 27 de noviembre al 1ero de diciembre del presente año en el Museo de la Ciudad de México, teniendo la inauguración en el marco de la noche de museos. <br/></p>
<p>Diversos artistas expondrán sus piezas, que tendrán un tinte de interactividad, por lo que esto acercará más al público. <br/></p>

<h3>Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes</h3>
<p></p>Al ser un festival que trabaja con tecnología, se necesita como en todo, dinero para poder lograr el objetivo. Los fondos recaudados serán utilizados para la producción de las

el equipo de Utopía en conjunto con el Museo de la Ciudad de México 
realizarán dos visitas guiadas a la exposición para personas sordomudas, haciendo de este tipo de eventos, algo más incluyente.

is a young not for profit visual & performing arts organization that serves
young adults, ages 18 through 24. We have been working with young artists in
our community, since our birth, a little over one year ago. 
What we do is nurture individual
artistic talents and help young artists discover new ones by providing the
tools, support and education. We work towards helping our members acquire
skills that can become professions and businesses in art related fields.
An organization like PIECES is needed
as young adults are no longer eligible for similar programming after the age of
18. We also know that many are often still in need of guidance in life, as well
as easily available opportunities to explore and grow artistically.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Me:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I'm a photographer from Argentina graduating from School in Colorado in April of 2013.You can look at my work at: <a href=""http://www.guadalupelaizphotographer.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.guadalupelaizphotographer.com</a></p>
<p>The project:</p>
<p><span>From Colorado, I would like to travel to several of the Western States in my car looking for interesting man-made locations. I plan on doing quite a bit of investigating and research before I leave home is search of these hidden or forgotten locations, whether they be antiquated buildings, or old historical sites, or basically what looks like the ruins of our constantly changing civilization. I have had success asking local small town shops to help supply clothing and accessories, so I should be able to use both local clothing and local models.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>They will certainly be unconventional photographs, but they will explore the landscapes in a way that glorifies them. I hope to get at least six strong and unique images from each location, and hope to travel to at least five locations, perhaps in different states like Wyoming, Oregon, Utah, Nevada, and New Mexico. Much like photographers take pictures of Americana that litters old route 66, I plan on finding the even more forgotten relics of the Western American landscape. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> Some of this hopefully month-long trip will be about the exploration of the forgotten American landscapes, and some of it will be about re-envisioning these landscapes through the use of models and digital photography. Though it is not fashion oriented, it will include fashions that will compliment the emotional truth I'm trying to convey. These will not be contrived costume shots. I want to create pieces that beg questions of the viewer through the narratives they create, so that they can exist on multiple levels, and be pleasing to observe, like great paintings. </p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span> </span>I would like this project to culminate into a unique book-length collection that I will work to publish. The book will ideally have five shots from each location, each conveying that emotional intensity I'm going for. Each location will have a short narrative explaining how and why I chose it, to help the reader fully understand its importance. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Why i need your help:</p>
<ul>
<li>I will need your help in order to first, stop working in order to travel.</li>
<li>Cover gas expenses and small expenses such as food and a place to stay, if there is a night or two that I can't find a place to camp out.</li>
<li>Help cover any expenses related to photography such as batteries/printing,etc</li>
<li>Print and publish the book. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p> </p>
<p>Why the project is so important to me:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I believe it will have value for several reasons. For one, I think I can capture these pieces of forgotten America in ways that will retell their history and maybe reshape their present. Imagine seeing very telling photos of abandoned houses, office buildings, ghost towns, mining cabins, all portrayed in unconventional light and color, with models who convey an intensity of emotion that changes the way the landscape is viewed. I think documenting these locations is important, before they disappear forever. I also think it is important to push the boundaries of the genres of photography. </p>

<p>The last supper meets goon......</p>
<p>We live in a society on the brink of cataclysmic changes to the base structure of our societal fabric.  Mankind has become its own worst enemy.  It constantly finds ways to make life better as well as new and inventive ways to cause our extinction in the blink of an eye.  These themes find their way into a large percentage of my photographic work.</p>
<p>I was born Robert Gouner, but most people know me as goon.  Robert is a supervisor who works 9 to 5 to support his family.  goon is who lives outside of those hours. I discovered this part of myself when I bought my first camera.  Until that point, I had hobbies.  I worked a day job that provided the basic needs for myself and my family.  There was always something missing from that ""other"" side of me. The less practical part that had thoughts and ideas outside the mundane world of corporate America. Photography gave an avenue to express those thoughts and changed my entire life. It allowed me to explore ideas and turn what was in my head into art.  I was surprised by the number of people who not only shared my vision, but collaborated, supported, and helped make the art possible. </p>
<p>In today's society too many people find themselves where I once was, working day in day out just to exist, without joy, without passion. They lack the drive or determination to seek an artistic outlet or to find the beauty in our fragile society.  I decided, with those first shots and projects, I will no longer be one of those people. I have been seeking new challenges ever since.</p>
<p>I have always had an appreciation for the abandoned landscapes. Seeing nature taking back an old building, park, or even sidewalk has always appealed to me.  I had a camera, some friends, an abandoned hospital and free Saturday ahead of me. Having previously scouted the location and noticing mold creeping up the first floor walls, we brought in resporators and gas masks purchased at an army surplus store. Deciding it was safer for the model to keep the gas mask on during one of the shots, a whole new era of photography was born to me.</p>

The Artivist Process distinguishes Art as Action from other performing arts organizations; the work that comes out of our unique method is unlike any other.  In addition to enhancing individual pieces, these sessions create a collective consciousness among the Artivists on how to impact the community, support each other and represent the diverse aspects of the show theme.  The passion and dedication of our Artivists is the essence of what makes all Art as Action productions successful and the unparalleled 2013 cast will make it our most innovative and impactful season to date.


Young Artivists Performance Lab
The Young Artivists Performance Lab (YAPL) is an opportunity for at-risk teens to find their artistic voice and work with experienced Artivists. YAPL provides participants the chance to explore a variety of art genres, methods of expression and where they intersect. More than just lessons in specific disciplines, the YAPL promotes artistic experimentation, creation and communication with others. Art as Action’s Artistic Director, in collaboration with Artivist Mentors, facilitates Weekly Artivist Sessions at Attention Homes’ Runaway and Homeless Youth Shelter.  Read the Daily Camera article  
Reconnect with your Body Dance Classes
Reconnect with your Body classes explore the power of dance, creativity and artistic expression and enable participants to discover new ways to move their bodies. Dance has the power to transform and heal - plus it’s fun!  Participants explore movement & music in ways that are enjoyable, stimulating & creative.  Reconnect with your Body is beneficial for all bodies, including people with Parkinson’s Disease and Multiple Sclerosis.  (Based on the Dance for PD® model originated by Mark Morris Dance and Brooklyn Parkinson Group.)  Art as Action Artistic Director and lifelong dancer Sarah Leversee teaches the classes.

<h2><strong>I've been selected to present at the 2013 American Art Therapy Conference in Seattle! Please help fund my trip!</strong></h2>
<p>I am a licensed art therapist and substance abuse counselor at a city hospital in Brooklyn, NY. I work in an outpatient program for adults who are dually-diagnosed with severe mental illness and chemical dependency. My job involves facilitating art therapy groups – groups where patients create artwork to address treatment issues relating to mental health, substance use, recovery, goals, and relationships.</p>
<p>This year, I have been selected to present a half-day course at the American Art Therapy Association’s National conference (<a href=""http://www.arttherapyconference.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.arttherapyconference.com/</a>), where art therapists from all over the world gather to learn and grow in this field. My course is called <strong>The Mural Connection: Exploring attachments through collaborative art-making</strong>. Each week, I run a mural group, where patients work together to create large-scale pieces of art. Research has shown that developing healthy relationships is a crucial part of addiction treatment and recovery. Collaborative art making encourages support between group members by offering creative non-verbal activities where patients can interact through the materials as practice for peer interaction, problem-solving, and sober socialization.</p>
<p>Substance abuse treatment, and specifically treatment that addresses both substance abuse and mental illness, is crucial in the world of behavioral health. Among people diagnosed with severe mental illness, there is a high prevalence of substance abuse, which can increase the likelihood of violence, non-compliance with treatment, and increased hospitalization and incarceration.</p>
<p>For the course, I will give a lecture, with examples from my work with patients, and then participants will work together in small groups to create murals, in order to experience the work in practice. This course provides information that is important for the treatment of substance abuse and mental health, and will give other art therapists an opportunity to explore this important topic and develop some skills to take with them into their own work.</p>
<p>The issue is that the conference is in Seattle, WA. And in order for me to present my course, I’m going to have to get myself to Seattle, and then get a place to stay. This is where you come in. Any donation, big or small, will be greatly appreciated. This is a big opportunity for me, and a big move in my career as an art therapist and substance abuse counselor, and my hope is that, with your help I can make it to Seattle to take advantage of this great opportunity.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

<h3>just call me ""KEEBS"" </h3>
<p>My name is Makeba, but you can just call me ""KEEBS."" I have 2 upcoming exhibits this Spring featuring my signature Digital Portraits (take a look at my site for examples: <a href=""http://www.JustCallMeKEEBS.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.JustCallMeKEEBS.com</a>) </p>
<p>This indiegogo campaign is to help cover part of the production costs for these two exhibits, specifically the costs of large-format printing and framing.</p>
<p>Without your help, I will not be able to participate in either of these shows. Gallery exhibits are important because they put my work in direct contact with serious art collectors and contribute to a large portion of my income...of my livelihood. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>the budget</h3>
<p>Printing: $1026</p>
<p>Framing (glass/matts/backing): $425</p>
<p><strong>total: $1451</strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>the Impact</h3>
<p>A little over a year ago I quit my full-time job to pursue a career as an artist. There have been many low points, but many more high points and I have honestly never been happier.</p>
<p>This past year I have met and collaborated with many talented creatives who, like me, believe that the art we make must have a purpose; it must achieve something positive and have an impact on those who experience it.</p>
<p>The purpose of my art is to bring attention to those that I work with who are going change the world. Therefore, most of my portraits are of people that I know who are doing amazing, life-changing things with their talents. </p>
<p>At both of these exhibits, my work is being dispalyed alongside a photograph of the subject taken by some of the many talented photographers that I know, and an excerpt from an interview that I've conducted with the subject. This sort of display achieves two things, 1) I get to share my space with other talented individuals, and 2) the audience gets to experience a new and unique way of viewing a comprehensive collection of work that is both visually pleasing and informational. </p>

<p style="""">Hello folks,<br/><br/>The 1Spot Gallery and I, Jaque Fragua, are trying this experiment of crowd-source funding for public art. In this campaign we are raising funds for a mural project, to bring more of an indigenous voice to the visual environment of Phoenix. Being a hub for Southwestern Native art and with a deep history of indigenous culture, it is imperative to continue the expression and relation of Native perspectives to the community of what is now known as Phoenix, or <em>S-ki:kigk in the O'odham language</em>.

In return, by donating to this fund you get a beautiful mural you can look at anytime you want and know that you contributed to the improvement of this communities health and growth.<br/><br/>This fund we are starting will be an on-going donation box for Native public art in Phoenix and beyond. As for now, the immediate kick-off project will be a mural in downtown Phoenix, starting May 29th, 2013. We are looking at a cost of $1000 to pay for paint supplies, rental equipment such as lifts, ladders, spray-guns, and some basic necessities for the artists such as water, snacks, fruit roll-ups, etc. Any residual funding will go back into the donation box for future Native murals to be produced!<br/><br/> I myself have travelled extensively and have created public art in many environments and I have only seen positive outcomes from painting in the streets and in the country.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>""Stairway to heaven"" (“Un escalier vers le ciel” in French) is an art installation created by French Burners, the <strong>French Burning Man regional group</strong>. The French burner community already has much experience creating burner-friendly and Burning Man themed events in France, and now we are ready to bring a touch of French flair to the playa this year as part of the Circle of Regional Effigies (CORE). Keeping in the spirit of radical inclusiveness, our team consists of not only French burners, but also several participants and collaborators from Italy, Spain, the United States and Canada.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>1/ BURNING MAN CORE: what is it?</h3>
<p>CORE is the acronym of ""<a href=""http://www.burningman.com/installations/art_core.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""CORE Installations at Burning Man"">Circle of Regional Effigies</a>"", which is a group of art installations created by various regional Burning Man communities around the world. The regional effigies, which are placed in a circle around the Man, illustrate how global communities of burners work year round to bring the culture of Black Rock City to the world at large.</p>
<p>This year's configuration will see 4 circles of six effigies placed around the base of the Man that will burn together on Thursday night to create the world's largest intentional simultaneous Burn!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our CORE Project for Burning Man 2013: Stairway to Heaven </h3>
<p>""<strong>Stairway to heaven</strong>"" is a road to the unknown, a vertical adventure with no other purpose than the experience itself. Excitement for new knowledge, exploring the unknown, curiosity about different people and being present for new experiences: this is our vision of a Cargo Cult.</p>
<p>The stairway is a spiral, ascending to a place where it is impossible to say what lies ahead. As in life sometimes, the participant follows an indirect path, getting closer to the center at each turn, closer to the heart. There is no clear, direct path to ascend towards the center. You learn from the path as you move forward and up, and the meaning comes from the experience. The journey itself is the reward.</p>
<p>Picture yourself 6 meters above the ground, taking a deep breath and enjoying the view of the playa, relishing the immediacy of the experience. Drink some wine at the summit and celebrate the gods of the playa, enjoying it like a prasad, a treat offered at the end of a hindu ritual. This experience of collaboration and artistic expression rising towards the heavens is a journey not only above the ground, but also within our selves.</p>
<p> Visit our blog <a href=""http://www.frenchcore-burningman.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Our French CORE blog"">www.frenchcore-burningman.com</a> to keep track of our project, and to discover cool content - for example, can you connect <a href=""http://www.frenchcore-burningman.com/cargo-cult-and-french-culture-serge-gainsbourg/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Serge gainsbourg and Cargo Cult at the Stairway to Heaven blog"">Serge Gainsbourg and Cargo Cult</a>?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why 4,000$? What do we need your contribution for?</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>Stairway to Heaven is a big installation entirely funded by our team. We had support from the french Burners community and organization, and also organized a few fundraising parties in Paris (and one unsuccessful online fundraising on KissKissBankBank), and now a large part of the project budget is covered, but we still need your help! The project budget does not include the travel costs of the French CORE crew or tickets to the event, those costs are the responsibility of the individual members of our team.</p>
<p>After raising the money to buy all the building materials and to secure a working space in Reno, we still need about <strong>1,500$ for transportation</strong>, in order to be able to move the structure from the pre-build space in Reno to the actual build site on the playa. Add a little above <strong>1,000$ for power tools and safety equipment</strong> for the burn. And then we need <strong>1,500$ to plant new trees</strong> in Nevada.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Help us plant trees in Nevada to offset our carbon footprint!</h3>
<p>We understand the impact on the environment that we produce by traveling all the way from Europe, building and burning the playa structure, so we decided to calculate our carbon footprint in terms of CO2 emissions, and to offset it by planting trees where we produce the most of the impact, in Nevada. According to <a href=""http://coolingman.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Cooling Man - Offset your burners emissions"">Cooling Man</a>, our playa project will produce about 30 tons of CO2. 5 trees are needed to offset each ton of CO2, so we'll be planting 150 new trees in Nevada! Can you help us?</p>
<p>We know crowdfunding supporters love to get swags, so we got some stuff ready to say thank you to all the supporters to our fundraising: patches, tshirts, even Stairway to Heaven customized EL-wire and DIY construction kits to build your own Stairway to Heaven scale model! But we also ask you to help reach our goal of planting enough trees to offset our carbon emissions. <strong>We promise</strong> you that if we go above our fundraising goal, we will use ALL the excess donations to plant more and more trees, so we can help offsetting the overall impact of Burning Man 2013.</p>

</div></div>","Summary
""Stairway to heaven"" (“Un escalier vers le ciel” in French) is an art installation created by French Burners, the French Burning Man regional group. The French burner community already has much experience creating burner-friendly and Burning Man themed events in France, and now we are ready to bring a touch of French flair to the playa this year as part of the Circle of Regional Effigies (CORE). Keeping in the spirit of radical inclusiveness, our team consists of not only French burners, but also several participants and collaborators from Italy, Spain, the United States and Canada.
 
1/ BURNING MAN CORE: what is it?
CORE is the acronym of ""Circle of Regional Effigies"", which is a group of art installations created by various regional Burning Man communities around the world. The regional effigies, which are placed in a circle around the Man, illustrate how global communities of burners work year round to bring the culture of Black Rock City to the world at large.
This year's configuration will see 4 circles of six effigies placed around the base of the Man that will burn together on Thursday night to create the world's largest intentional simultaneous Burn!
 
Our CORE Project for Burning Man 2013: Stairway to Heaven 
""Stairway to heaven"" is a road to the unknown, a vertical adventure with no other purpose than the experience itself. Excitement for new knowledge, exploring the unknown, curiosity about different people and being present for new experiences: this is our vision of a Cargo Cult.
The stairway is a spiral, ascending to a place where it is impossible to say what lies ahead. As in life sometimes, the participant follows an indirect path, getting closer to the center at each turn, closer to the heart. There is no clear, direct path to ascend towards the center. You learn from the path as you move forward and up, and the meaning comes from the experience. The journey itself is the reward.
Picture yourself 6 meters above the ground, taking a deep breath and enjoying the view of the playa, relishing the immediacy of the experience. Drink some wine at the summit and celebrate the gods of the playa, enjoying it like a prasad, a treat offered at the end of a hindu ritual. This experience of collaboration and artistic expression rising towards the heavens is a journey not only above the ground, but also within our selves.
 Visit our blog www.frenchcore-burningman.com to keep track of our project, and to discover cool content - for example, can you connect Serge Gainsbourg and Cargo Cult?
 
Why 4,000$? What do we need your contribution for?


Stairway to Heaven is a big installation entirely funded by our team. We had support from the french Burners community and organization, and also organized a few fundraising parties in Paris (and one unsuccessful online fundraising on KissKissBankBank), and now a large part of the project budget is covered, but we still need your help! The project budget does not include the travel costs of the French CORE crew or tickets to the event, those costs are the responsibility of the individual members of our team.
After raising the money to buy all the building materials and to secure a working space in Reno, we still need about 1,500$ for transportation, in order to be able to move the structure from the pre-build space in Reno to the actual build site on the playa. Add a little above 1,000$ for power tools and safety equipment for the burn. And then we need 1,500$ to plant new trees in Nevada.
 
Help us plant trees in Nevada to offset our carbon footprint!
We understand the impact on the environment that we produce by traveling all the way from Europe, building and burning the playa structure, so we decided to calculate our carbon footprint in terms of CO2 emissions, and to offset it by planting trees where we produce the most of the impact, in Nevada. According to Cooling Man, our playa project will produce about 30 tons of CO2. 5 trees are needed to offset each ton of CO2, so we'll be planting 150 new trees in Nevada! Can you help us?
We know crowdfunding supporters love to get swags, so we got some stuff ready to say thank you to all the supporters to our fundraising: patches, tshirts, even Stairway to Heaven customized EL-wire and DIY construction kits to build your own Stairway to Heaven scale model! But we also ask you to help reach our goal of planting enough trees to offset our carbon emissions. We promise you that if we go above our fundraising goal, we will use ALL the excess donations to plant more and more trees, so we can help offsetting the overall impact of Burning Man 2013.

<h2 style=""margin-left: 120px;""><strong>Metaldudes + Cats Book</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>PUBLISHING THE BOOK</strong></h3>
<p>FINALLY!  I have come to the stage in my two years of work on the Metaldudes Cats Book where I am ready to publish! </p>
<p>My name is Alexandra Crockett and I began the project Metaldudes Cats Book back in 2010.  I had just been talking with my roommate at the time about how interesting - and cute - it was that alot of guys in the metal scene seem to have pets, and particularly cats.  I decided to do a little experiment and contact as many of my metaldude friends as I could at that exact moment and ask them what they thought of this concept as a photo project.  Reaction:  EXCITEMENT and DELIGHT!  This reaction made my mind up to go ahead and start the project itself by setting up model release forms and photoshoots.</p>
<p>The metal scene has long been thought of as a culture of people who are into dark, depressing, even disturbing imagery and ideas.  I believe that in alot of ways, these portrayals have spilled over into judgments over people's character as well. In general these judgments are not only negative, but also incorrect most of the time.  This, of course, can also be said of the portrayal of men in our society.</p>
<p>Metaldudes Cats Book challenges stereotypes of masculinity and the metal culture in general.  Now... I think we can all agree that cat photos and videos are a pretty integral part of the internet these days, so it feels a little pointless to describe why you might want to look at more cute cats.  DUH!  However: Metaldudes Cats Book combines three loves that have a global reach:  Kitties, Metal, and Duuuudes.  A love of kitties binds together the entire world together, even tough guys and those who listen to brutal harsh music.</p>
<p>Contributing to this project will, in essence, allow me to publish the book itself.  I am a lone person here, working on a huge project.  Publication means that all of my hard work will finally come to fruition, and that I will be able to give something back to the metal scene which I grew up in!  I've done over 110 photoshoots in person up and down the West Coast (and yes, I drove to all of them myself, usually alone), have collected over 300 submitted photos from all over the world, and have put on metal shows to benefit no-kill cat shelters in my book's name.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>The book will cost, on average, $9000-14000 to publish and produce a short-run of a couple hundred books of the size and length necessary.  My unique perks for contributors include handmade prints of my artwork, handmade custom jewelry, and candles or blankets with prints of photos from the book.  I also have shirts and pins that will go out to contributors of lower amounts, as I am SO SO SO appreciative of anyone who is willing to help this project move forward.</p>
<p>If I do not reach my entire goal, all of the funds raised will still go towards publishing, and I will simply have to find some other way to raise the rest of the money: either through a personal loan or selling my own belongings (I am more than willing to do either!  I'm seriously that much of a crazy cat lady.).</p>
<p>Once the book is published and available for purchase, I will be donating 40% of the proceeds from sales to local no-kill cat shelters (""local"" meaning one shelter per city in Seattle, Portland, Oakland and Los Angeles).  Therefore, your help in publishing this book also helps to keep no-kill shelters on the West Coast up and running.</p>
<p><em><strong>* EVEN CONTRIBUTIONS OF $1-$5 ARE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL *</strong> </em></p>
<p>I realized that if everyone on my fanpage and everyone on my facebook contributed $2 each I would surpass my goal.  That's crazy!!  But it shows how people can come together to make a difference.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>IF you are unable to contribute monetarily, you can still help me get published by sharing This Campaign, as well as my facebook page (<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/MetaldudesCatsBook"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">www.facebook.com/MetaldudesCatsBook</a>) * !  It's incredibly helpful to get the word out to anyone and everyone you know, whether it's friends or family, metal fans, cat fans, or simply people intrigued by the strangeness and fun of the project.</p>
<p>*To do so you can use the indiegogo SHARE tools.</p>
<p>THANK YOU SO MUCH to everyone who has contributed and is contributing, and also to everyone supporting my work on the Metaldudes Cats Book project!  The past two years have been an amazing if not crazy ride, and I am so excited to share this final product of an actual published work with everyone.  &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3</p>

<h3>My Project<br/>
</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">My project is titled Art Out(side). It will take place
between <span style="""">January 15th and April
20th, 2012 at the ART342 residency in Fort Collins, CO. At Art 342 I will have
14 weeks of undivided time to spend on this project. I plan to make a series of
temporary sculptures outside of the gallery structure in places like public parks,
forests, empty commercial spaces, and any where else I can. Each piece will be
altered throughout its set duration from the weather, viewer interaction, and
the changes I will make in response. It is important to me to bring this work
into an environment where external forces can play as large a role in the works
creation as anything I do. <br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I feel it's vital to bring art to places where people can have the opportunity to encounter it during the course of their daily routine. I'm hoping to reach a broader audience by bringing this work out of the gallery and into the every day. In this economic climate of drastic budget cuts, it's especially critical to let people know why art is important and why it should be funded. Art isn't just for the art educated, it's for everyone. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My fundraising goal is $1000, though my expenses will far exceed that amount. I will primarily be using my own money and the $100 a week stipend for materials that Art342 generously provides. If you are excited by the project and have the means to donate, please do. Every donation will receive a gift, or perk, as a thank you. You can read more about the perks offered on the right side column of this page.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I will use the money donated for materials, printing, travel to and from Ft. Collins, CO, and any other expense related to the project. If I don't raise my goal amount the project will still go on, but not at the scale that it could reach with these additional funds. I am a recent MFA graduate with student loan debt after all. <br/></p>

It explores the philosophy of liberty and the hot topic of immigration in the US with the Statue of Liberty as the central symbolic figure as subject. The project is partly inspired by my own experience as an expat living in another country and even moreso by my own grandparents' immigration experience to the US where they were welcomed and greeted by the towering statue during the early part of the 20th century.Using oil, acrylic and sometimes encaustic painting techniques, newspapers and other printed materials (including printed screenshots of some current events) to create a total of 5 very large paintings and approximately 30 finished smaller works of varying sizes which will complete the series. Also there will be a number of other studies (paintings, pastels, charcoal drawings) that will be documented and posted on line as well.Here are my first three initial studies in paint of the statue itself:It is my hope that the narrative created through the visual works for this project will prompt people to consider their own heritage and experience, as well as, others' experiences. The art asks the viewer to examine what liberty means to them in their own lives and to contemplate how these same ideas of liberty apply to others. people, Does every person have the rights to the same freedoms.Exhibition and WebsiteThe works will be exhibited this summer either in a gallery in Assisi, Italy or in my home city of Cluj-Napoca, one of the largest cities in Romania. I hope to exhibit the art in both locations and have begun a dialogue to this end. I need your help to make it happen. I will update the project as more information becomes available and a location is confirmed.The works will be accessible to viewers worldwide though the development of a website dedicated to the project. The website will include a blog portion in which I hope to engage the communitry through commenting and encouraging others to share their own opinions and stories.Personal History behind the Project: Three GenerationsThis project in its simplist form started as an idea in early 2013 when thinking about the promise of freedom and liberty through three generations. The promise of freedom was thrust upon my maternal grandmother who unwillingly came to the US. Tragedy changed my grandmother's destiny and brought her alone and scared to an unknown place, changing her life forever. My paternal and maternal grandfathers came before her from Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire.Both of my parents, first generation americans, embraced american life and culture. My father was a photojournalist who embraced the american way and pursued and fulfilled his own american dream. He was assigned to shoot the Statue of Liberty in the 1970s; the statue was nearly 100 years old. The series of b&w images that he took of the Statue of Liberty are part of the reference materials I am using to create my paintings and mixed media pieces.I, a second generation american as an expat, am pursuing my own artistic practice in a land closer to my grandmothers origin, in a time where the dream no longer seems possibile in the US.How the funds will be used:Materials - Wood Panels, Cardboard, Stretcher bars, Fabric, Rabbit Glue, Gesso, Pigments, Mediums, Brushes, Charcoal, Tape, Beeswax, Linseed Oil, Turpentine, Sketchbook, Other misc supplies.Studio Space -  6 month rental - Studio space is essential to completion of this project since I live in a 1 room efficiency apartment + two dogs. While I can sketch, it is impossible for me to create larger works and is difficult to use oil as a medium in such a small space due to the fumes.Project Printing -  Historical images and other digital items must be printed for use in some of the multi-media pieces.Exhibition Costs  - costs for the exhibitions include matting and/or framing of some of the small works to be exhibited, as well as, transporting the works by courier. Many works will not require matting and framing (i.e. stretched canvas, unstretched canvas with grommets, etc.)Website  - costs related to purchasing a domain name and hosting the site. I have worked as a front-end developer and will create and update the site myself.Perks Printing Costs - Limited Edition Prints, Liberty Project Catalog, Postcards, Vinyl Stickers.Perks Shipping - includes a bulk package from Romania for any items larger than letter sized envelopes of project rewards which will then be distributed from the NY area - all materials will be sent certified to verify receipt of the rewards. This is the most economical way to ship rewards to North America. Rewards shipped to other areas will be send via the Romanian Postal Service certified.Basic Living - a portion of the funds will cover some of my own basic expenses during these months (food, basic utilities) as I am dedicating myself entirely to this project and will not be accepting any other outside work during this period.Indiegogo fees - If my goal is met Indiegogo takes 4% of the total amount funded. If I do not reach my goal 9% of the project funds go to Indiegogo. The Liberty Project PerksWhen you fund this project, based on your contribution you can receive any of  the following:

a set of 5, 10 or 15 full colour postcards from the project

A limited number of original art paintings, mixed media assembleges and sketches from the project will be available.

<h3>OUTDATED ALIMONY LAWS</h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Perhaps you know someone who has been ""taken to the cleaners"" by an ex-spouse or perhaps you have been in the situation yourself.  Stunned by an 18 month (so far) process of determining spousal support, I've spent this time exploring the loopholes that allow California's outdated marriage and divorce laws which can be exploited by anyone in the know.</p>
<p>Artist, Photographer and Writer, I want to illustrate a story of Schmoe in various situations with a satyrical eye for citizens who are perplexed by the Kafkaesque nature of family law in the country.</p>
<p>Schmoe is a good guy who believes in doing the right thing.  He pays his bills on time, cleans the house when he gets home &amp; supports his wife in her artistic endeavors so that ultimately, they can operate as independent artists.  What happens from there, one can only imagine.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am setting a goal of $43,200 (based on the 4320 factors considered in determining spousal support in California), to write, publish and distribuite my book.</p>
<p>Perks range from a line on the ""Wall of Claims"" at the end of the book for any schmoe (male or female) who may have been financially ahnialated by the system (the case description i.e.  ""Kramer v. Kramer, State of Califonia, 9th Circuit Superior court, 2012"") to a personalized illustration of a situation you might be in to an autographed copy of the book sent to your ex served up by a legitimate service.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Marriage laws in California are in desperate need of re-evaluation:</p>

<p>My name is Kamil and I'm Freelance 3D Generalist, I'm from Poland and live in Gliwice. I was working for many companies over the World. My adventure with Computer Graphics, especially 3D was started about 10 years ago.<br/><br/>I learn all the things by myself from books, and mostly from tutorials. I'm planning to run a site with CG tutorials and that is why I'm starting an Indiegogo project.</p>
<p>Recently I'm on photogrammetry topic. I know it very well, from the beginning to the end. By end I mean realistic 3D rendering with PBR materials, which can be used in any type of projects. Games, animations, advertise, architecture, 3D printing and I believe many more.<br/><br/>My tutorial series will contain almost every step of creating a model in photogrammetry technique.<br/>We will start with camera settings, building a small lighting studio, and off course shooting principles.<br/>Don't worry if You haven't photo camera, My tutorial will also contain a chapter for using camera in Your Smartphone.<br/><br/>We will work on few projects, from simpler ones to more difficult to learn possibly most everything regarding the topic. <br/><br/>I hope You will help Me to achieve this goal, so I can work further and teach people, which I like the most.<br/> </p>
<p>Funding will allow Me creating this tutorial series. Rest of it for creating a site with CG tutorials. But not as it is on many sites. I like to make a service where We will have whole projects. Simple projects, difficult, where We will use few software to creating it. <br/><br/>Everyone who will fund My project. Will get whole tutorial series with project files. <br/><br/> </p>

<p>Everyone who contribute will have instant updates. Whole tutorial will be ready at the latest on first days of October. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What if funding fails?</h3>
<p>Because I'm on flexible goal funding. If funding will fail. Everyone who contribute will get the tutorial anyway. But the completion time of it may be longer. </p>
<p>But let's go tell Your friends, spread the message. This will be the best tutorial on the topic. </p>
<h3>Last words</h3>
<p>Tutorial will be also available after completion, but for much more, around 100$, with funding You have a chance to get it really cheap. I really hope You can help Me to meet my little dream of having tutorial service with creative content. </p>
